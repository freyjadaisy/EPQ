    "title": "STAB article on the tariffs....pretty interesting",
    "body": "  \nSTAB just put out a pretty well written and thoughtful article about how these tariffs will affect the industry. I won't post/steal the whole article but here's a couple quotes.  Surprisingly Biolos comes off pretty well (I haven't agreed with a lot of his \"philosophies\" in the past. Pyzel as well.  Anyway, if you have an account go check it out it's pretty interesting. [https://stabmag.com/features/how-will-the-us-tariffs-looming-recession-affect-surfboard-prices/](https://stabmag.com/features/how-will-the-us-tariffs-looming-recession-affect-surfboard-prices/) :\n\n**Stab: You‚Äôve been thinking about surfboard tariffs for over two decades. Why is this such a big deal to you?**\n\nMatt Biolos: Well, for me, it goes all the way back to the early 2000s. That was when Surf Tech came in like a wrecking ball. They were taking all these board designs, mass-producing them overseas, and dumping them into the U.S. market. And they were aggressive about it. They were approaching every big name in surfboards to license their models. And most guys took the deal. Channel Islands, Rusty, Donald Takayama ‚Äî they all did deals with Surf Tech. And people were telling me I should too. I had people saying, ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt do a deal, you‚Äôre going to be out of business.‚Äù\n\n  \n**Jon Pyzel is, in his words, ‚Äúprobably on the opposite end of the political spectrum from Matt Biolos.‚Äù He runs a B Corp-certified surfboard business with his wife Dali. And while he doesn‚Äôt pretend to make ‚Äúsustainable‚Äù surfboards ‚Äî because, as he points out, nobody really does ‚Äî Pyzel Surfboards tries to offset some of the damage. That means paying employees fairly, hiring underrepresented folks, and making sure people aren‚Äôt getting screwed over in the supply chain.**\n\n**Unlike many of his peers, Pyzel doesn‚Äôt manufacture boards in Asia. Outside his two factories in Oceanside and Haleiwa, he works with licensees to build boards regionally.**\n\n**Stab: What‚Äôs your first impression on these new tariffs?**\n\nJon Pyzel: I mean, who knows what‚Äôs really happening? Every day there‚Äôs a different headline. One minute it‚Äôs 10% on everything. The next day it‚Äôs 25% on Mexico. It‚Äôs chaotic. I‚Äôve got a close friend, Andrew Jakubowski, who owns Arctic Foam, and he‚Äôs just tripping out. He‚Äôs like, ‚ÄúHow am I supposed to plan my business?‚Äù And I get that. It‚Äôs a hard time to be running anything that depends on international trade.\n\nWe‚Äôve used Arctic Foam for years. They make great blanks down in Ensenada. So if something drastic happens ‚Äî if suddenly the cost of those blanks jumps significantly ‚Äî yeah, there‚Äôs a chance we‚Äôll have to look at other options. There‚Äôs no ‚Äúextra‚Äù for us to absorb those costs. Margins are already razor thin. But I‚Äôd still try to support Arctic as much as possible. I believe in them.\n\n**Would that mean switching to U.S.-made blanks if prices equalize?**\n\nPossibly. I‚Äôm not going to lie and say we‚Äôd just eat the cost forever. If U.S. blanks suddenly became the same price as what I was paying for Mexican ones, we‚Äôd probably make the switch. Not because we want to, but because we have to. Surfboards are expensive to make and margins are already incredibly small.",

It's actually quite logical as the passive back musculature is heavily demanded when \"slacklining\" (I don't even know if that is a term or if I just made it up).\n\nSo - I am thinking about changing career to become a YouTube content creator that I might call \"Slacklining for Surfers\" - or even have an app where I would post videos of me on the slackline especially for surfers (with content I stole from other youtubers) - a subscription would only be 24,99‚Ç¨ a month or 199,99‚Ç¨ for a year (yes - I am european).\n\nAm I a good surfer?

It's really hard to find anyone that doesn't like either of them. \n\nI've been surfing for about 12 years and am a solid intermediate. I'm currently riding a 6'2 Lost Subdriver, which I love, but I think I'm ready to switch sides and start riding Twin/Fishes on the daily. I've realized I'm never going to be a total shortboard ripper at this point in my life (I just turned 40), but I love surfing as much as I ever have. Fishes are just more fun for me personally. \n\nSo now I'm trying to decide which board to go with. Albums are very expensive, but honestly buying a new RNF run's about $800 and there's some Twinsman around for $950- I don't mind the difference if it's worth it. \n\nOne factor that has stopped me from making the switch to fishes earlier in my surfing journey is that I live in a beautiful, remote part of Panama blessed with a few long right point breaks, which are backside for me (Goofy). Anyone here have any advice on which board will be more fun riding backside? Also open to other models but these two seem to check the boxes. Any help appreciated!",

    "body": "Hey all,\n\nI'm heading down to Nica for a few weeks. Going to buy a used board when I get down there and currently looking at a few options.\n\nI currently ride a 5'9 x 20 x 2 1/2 / 29.5 L back home. My top contenders are a 5'10 x 19 1/4 / 32 L board or a 6'6 x 18 7/8 / 33 L one (both 2 1/2\"). Can't tell from the pics on what the rockers look like.\n\nNot sure what might be the best one to pick (or keep looking at my other options) given how each might ride as well as the waves (punchier beach breaks and points). It feels like the 6'6 might almost be a step-up for me?\n\nTIA for any guidance.",

    "body": "So my wife, my buddy and I are planning on heading out to Indonesia at the beginning of September for a 2-3 week trip. Primary objective is to surf our faces off. \n\nWe currently live in Sayulita and have been surfing 5-7 days a week on 9‚Äô+ boards. Can easily catch anything from 1-6 feet and walking the board is standard, with a few 5‚Äôs and an occasional 10 if we are really in the zone. So I would consider us to be intermediate level longboarders.\n\nSeeing as we are only going to be there for 2-3 weeks, I‚Äôm guessing that we will need a guide and access to boards, boats, etc. would prefer to settle into one ‚Äúresort‚Äù or ‚Äúcamp‚Äù and travel from there. Any recommendations on islands/resorts/guides? From what I have read, I‚Äôm thinking that Lombok or West Java is where we want to be. \n\nTLDR: Intermediate Longboarders, 2-3 weeks in September. Looking for recommendations ",
