COMMUNICATIONS?! Oh dear lord!\"\n\n\"I know!! Is phony major!!\"\n\nGod I love that quote from that episode!\n\nNo no no, the fans will whoop it up with that ~~leg~~ ankle tonight. You know, drink beer out of it, and so on, but uh, it'll turn up in the morning and I'll sew it back on.\n\nFinally, an Anton Lubchenko reference in the wild.\n\n\"Don't worry, you can always fall back on your degree in.... \\*gasp\\* COMMUNICATIONS?!\"\n\n\"I admit it, it's phony major! Vincenko learn nothing. Nothing!!!\"\n\n‚ÄúAnd they‚Äôre all going to be signing autographs!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWoohoo!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúCommunications?! Oh my Lord!‚Äù\n\nOnly his plant foot but yeah you‚Äôre right\n\nAs a soccer player I have to disagree. When you kick kick with your left, it‚Äôs your right foot that supports all your weight. I had a severe injury on my left knee and it mostly affected kicking and passing with my right foot.\n\nYou don‚Äôt have to be a soccer player to realize he‚Äôs joking.\n\n[deleted]\n\nwhen I twisted my ankle playing basketball I wasn't even in pain, I was just laughing at how comically big my ankle got. Unreal view.\n\nRight? Looked like a fucking melon with my foot sticking out of it. Took ages to heal too\n\nAnd for a lot of people, even ones i know, it never truly does, and I no idea why\n\nTendons and ligaments have shitty blood flow. You have to really focus on healing it and even athletes with access to the best care aren‚Äôt always the same after sprains or tears\n\nCan attest to this. Having sprained ankles, shins, knees, hip bursitis. \n\nThese are what I call forever injuries, where you're never quite right again, regardless of age. Did my shins in my 20s, ankles in my 30s and knees &amp; hips in my 40s. The only one that feels 100% is the bad knee sprain I got, ironically, just a few years ago in my early 40s.\n\nI think this is entirely because it's the only time I had a sprain where I did absolutely nothing at all for 2 months afterwards. I just sat around with it elevated, and followed every protocol for proper healing. And, after a month and half when it felt 100% normal again; waited another month doing hardly anything, before I started hiking again.\n\nI think a huge one is being patient and humble enough to just rest it completely and wait a long-ass time to resume exercise again. I never did that for my shins or ankles when I was much younger, and they both still bother me.\n\nOut of all the injuries, I really feel knee sprain is just the worst. So much potential for it to go completely sideways and turn into a full-on tear at some point. Which leaves you fucked for life, surgery or not.\n\nI have shitty ankles, running , football and the like.  I wish I would‚Äôve had them done a long time ago.  Now, i have to have them done as i cant walk without pain.  Im a big dummy.\n\nYeah I was a constant ankle sprainer when I was younger, had to have ankle surgery to repair my tendon and ligaments in December because I never let it heal properly.\n\nDealing with this now. Every few days I take a step and it feels like a scabs being pulled off inside my foot.  Then we start the healing again. Been 3 months now.\n\nTorn ligaments don't really heal by themselves. You have 2 options, you can do PT and kinda try to roll them back together with a device with a round flat metal end or you get surgery where they thread them back together.\n\nBut yeah, most people, like me who couldn't do PT Everytime I've rolled my ankles, just rest and let the swelling subside. Now both my ankles are fucked, my right one twice as much. Basically, one wrong step just walking, on a non flat surface, and it's basically rolled as if I hurt it in basketball again. \n\nLuckily my left one isn't as bad, but still rolls easily.\n\nMy torn ligaments healed by themselves. Took 6 months though. Some absolute melon decided to kick my ankle instead of the ball at 5-a-side. Broke 2 of his toes too.\n\nMe exact same thing.\n\nSimilar happened to me years ago.   \nBut ankle has never been 100% since.\n\nAny solution?\n\nHave you had an MRI or ultrasound done? You could have torn a ligament, or developed arthritis depending on the severity of the injury. (Source - chronic ankle injuries due to connective tissue disease since childhood with one failed ligament reconstruction surgery under my belt and too many MRI's to count)\n\nyeah... this.   and if you're american.   good luck.     I've had to go through like 6 different podiatrists to get one to order an MRI   for an old injury that flared back up after a sprain.  \n\n  \nevery one of those numb nuts wants you to do  orthotics/in-soles,  ice,  for 6 mo,  then cortisol shots,   ...no thank you.  just fucking scan my ankle please to see if the same scar tissue that fucked me up when i was 20yrs old,  is back again in my ankle.    ---\n\nSad to hear that bud, hope to see you fine and kickin soon.  \n  \nMine is not swollen, painful or anything. Neither does it feel any different than a perfectly normal foot during usual days.\n\nOnly when I have walked the whole day, or I've played an extreme sport for decent duration.. it just feels like someone pinning a needle at my left ankle very squeakily, saying here there boy, calm your horses!\n\nSo yea you might be right, I might have a ligament tear.   \nIn whatever case, does surgery fix it after 6-7 years of the incident?\n\nYep, length of time shouldn't affect it that much (other than the longer you go, the greater the risk of developing more complications). My worst ankle break was in 2012, and I didn't have the ligament reconstruction until 2018.\n\nWobble board. Takes a long time (months to a year) but eventually you strengthen the ligaments and get stability back. Tore up my ankle a few times but I‚Äôm about 95% to where I was before my first 3rd degree sprain.\n\nThis seems doable, thanks man\n\nEpsom salt baths , and write the abcs with your foot while keeping ankle in one spot . I sprained my ankle and it hadn‚Äôt been feeling good for a whole year after then I re-sprained  it doing something stupid ( dunking on a mini hoop ) but oddly enough respraining it helped me rehab it properly and healed back almost to full strength\n\nWD40\n\nOne of my ankles go twisted and then I kept limping for a month. Never told my parents cause Indian parents. After a month it kinda recovered but then same thing happened to the other ankle. üòÇ. Limped another month or two and finally I have equally constrained ankles. They only pain when I do squats on the leg day, other than that I am fine.\n\nTry barefoot shoes, cheap ones for short walks on soft surfaces. It will naturally strenghten your ankles in safe way.\n\nSame. And in three days it‚Äôs gone. And I‚Äôm old and with terrible health insurance\n\nWhoever decided that the pitch needed water on a humidity night like last night should be fired.\n\nThat‚Äôs exactly what I was thinking. The amount of slipping and injuries/falls this game was insane.\n\nHe didn't slip to injure himself. He gripped too hard when going out of bounds.\n\n[deleted]\n\nGoddamn I wasn't expecting this reference here. Thank you for the laugh\n\nHe continued to play after that, it wasn't until he slipped in the middle of the field chasing after a Colombian player that this happened.\n\nUSA‚Äôs World Cup hosting privileges should be revoked after the Copa. What a fucking joke of a job they did with the stadiums/turf.\n\nThe tournament was run by CONMEBOL not FIFA\n\nhttps://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/40491687/copa-america-poor-pitch-conditions-united-states-2026-world-cup\n\nhttps://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/40562604/copa-america-2024-review-controversies-surprises-analysis-reaction\n\nWait, they're called con-me ball?\n\nThis tournament was not operated by US Soccer. The issues with the turf and surface should be reviewed though.\n\nI‚Äôm fairly certain they said the stadiums will be upgraded before the WC\n\nAlso recently they cohosted a cricket tournament with se shit management of pitches\n\nI work in manufacturing in the US and I can tell you, culturally, quality is completely dead in The USA. Everyone is doing their shittiest job at every level of every industry.\n\nWell that game is probably his last ‚Äúbig stage game‚Äù\n\nI doubt his legacy will be topped for quite some time, if ever.\n\nYeah, no chance. The longevity, records, awards, trophies, achievements, style, and personality stats this man produced will not be replicated or passed for centuries. He was a once-in-a-civilization talent.\n\nEdit: A lot of butthurt replies to this comment. Just face it. Messi was an outlier. Accept it and move on.\n\nLongevity is becoming the norm (yay modern sports science) \nThe other stuff is basically impossible to predict. The sport is changing and it‚Äôs very hard to know how people will adapt.\n\n[deleted]\n\nEvery sport has people doing that. Lebron, Brady, Messi, Djokovic all dominated their sports for much longer than usual, and all at basically the same time. We aren‚Äôt seeing ‚Äúonce in a lifetime longevity‚Äù, we‚Äôre seeing it all over the sporting world. It stands to reason this might happen more often these days than ever before (which is not to say it ll be common by any means, just not once or twice in a leagues history)\n\ncall me when someone beats gretzky\n\nOvechkin is actually really close in goals, which is honestly pretty extraordinary. No one is ever touching his assist or total points though\n\nImagine if Ovi played against 80s goalkeepers\n\nTbf, ovi‚Äôs signature slapshot wouldn‚Äôt be nearly as effective with the older sticks. Those don‚Äôt take nearly as much stress\n\nBaseball seems to be going backwards in longevity\n\nNo one will ever come close to Cy Young's complete game record, which is in the 800s.\n\nModern football has far too much playing time. Players will get injured more. Hard to maintain peaks. They may play longer but not at their levels like Messi or Ronaldo did.\n\nFor sure. if you look at where skateboarding and snowboarding are now.  \"Do a TRE-Flip!!\"  is now met with '...ok\"   if some kid could just bang out a couple casper slides, or stomp a rodeo when i was a kid he'd be getting money for nothing and chicks for free. ...i just landed my first tre at 39.  The entire level of the sports and the players are rising.\n\nSaid that in tennis about Sampras and then Federer, Nadal and Djoker showed up.\n\nAnd they said that about Federer, Nadal, and Djokovic, but then who knows how far Alcaraz‚Äôs career will take him - he‚Äôs off to a better start than the big 3¬†\n\nYes if he's as talented as them and another two don't show up soon....\n\nImagine if only one of them existed and they weren't around to compete for trophies, just how many any one of them could have pulled off.\n\n\"Brady will never be topped\" and now Mahomes has 3 rings and is playing at an insane level\n\nLol calm down, people were saying the same about Pel√© just a couple decades ago\n\nAnd they were right? His records are only now getting beaten 70 years later\n\nThat's not \"once in a civilization\" or unsurpassed for hundreds of years lol. Maybe once in a lifetime\n\nNah we about to wrap shit up here\n\n[removed]\n\nYou assume there will be both coconuts and humans, that's pretty optimistic\n\nYou assume Gur is supposed to be a human, when it's practically guarantee it's going to be a superior Octopus\n\nPel√© was playing a different game than everyone else. If you know how to play chess when everyone is playing checkers you‚Äôre a genius. But Messi, he was playing against so much incredible talent, and he still rose above them all. He‚Äôs the GOAT. Much respect to Pel√©, but Messi is on another level.\n\nMessi's records are like the 100 points from Wilt Chamberlain. No one has even come close in any way shape or form. Curry has hit 10+ threes multiple times and hasnt even broke 70 points ever.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMessi's records are actually more like if Wilt scored 150 points in a single game that's how far out someone has to reach to beat his records\n\nExactly. Same with maradona. Eventually it‚Äôs bound to happen. How long it TAKES to happen is a matter of luck and patience\n\nWhen you take a look at marathon or Olympic records, they‚Äôve slowly improved over the last 80 years so much. Better nutrition, better training methods, more science, better tech etc. \n\nI reckon the standard will just get higher of football and it‚Äôll mean the next Messi will have to be even better to just stand out\n\nI bet modern football players are of much higher standard than even 1990's, the technology and facilities have improved tremendously over pats 20-30 years.\n\nDifferent sport too. Getting cute with the ball meant amputation by Roy Keane\n\nWe're just going to have to wait for someone with 3 names to take the crown then.\n\nOr 4, Lamine Yamal Nasaroui Ebana\n\nOoh... Just double the amount of names from the last GOAT...\n\nNice thinking.\n\nExcept the next one after that will have to have 8 names.\n\nDoesnt Mbappe have 3 Names?\n\nBet u any of these guy talking messi never even seen pele highlights, the guy was crazy it‚Äôs easy to see where ronaldo9 neymar,endrick probably Robinho got their inspiration from\n\nCenturies?\n\nOnce in a civilization talent üòÇüòÇ\n\nI am crying. You nugget.\n\n2nd best goalscorer (most goals per match) , best creator (most assists) and best dribbler. To be at the very top of all 3 important categories for an offensive player is honestly unheard of.  Usually even the very best of the best are top 2 in maybe 1 category either scorer, creator or dribbler but he's legit at the top of all. I just find this the most crazy part.\n\nWell well. There is this 16 year old who won the freaking euros. So maybe‚Ä¶‚Ä¶\n\nFirst he needs to beat Morata 1v1 and then we'll start considering it lol\n\nThere will never be another one like Messi ,give it at least 100+ years and not even then ,what this bloke does on a pitch has no explanation\n\nIve seen clips of Messi from this Copa America, he looked a bit off the pace.. but still, would pay to watch that bloke at his age. \n\nRonaldo on the other hand‚Ä¶ looked an embarassment for his nation at the Euros. \n\nThe debate is non existent, and yet again, Messi lifts another international trophy. \n\nBest ever\n\nYou can give kudos to Messi without talking down on Ronaldo, buddy. Remember he was the only player in the past 20 years to compete toe-to-toe against this freak of nature who was literally created to be the best ever, and who surpassed him in some categories. \n\nRespect where respect is due.\n\nRonaldo is also 2 and half years older\n\nYou clearly did not watch Ronaldo at the Euro‚Äôs as in no way was he an ‚Äòembarrassment for his nation‚Äô.\n\n[deleted]\n\nI'm sure after this injury he'll play the next Finalissima\n\nDude it's a sprained ankle. üôÑ\n\nThey‚Äôre referring to his age. He is widely speculated to retire on the international stage.\n\nNah, he‚Äôll stay at Miami until he can play WC 2026 and then retire (mid-season in MLS because nobody cares about that)\n\nI dunno if he can play WC 2026 optimally....it's clearly becoming too much for his body.\n\nBecause of that one injury? Lol. It‚Äôs just another day at the office for him.\n\nNot really. Here's [Serena Williams' destroyed ankle](https://i.eurosport.com/equinoxe/2015/05/05/1476286.jpg) right before the swelling subsided and she went on to win more slams.\n\nGrew up skateboarding, i remember having such a bad sprained ankle that my entire leg turned purple and yellow all the way up past my knee, was skating again in like a month.\n\nI think it has less to do with the injury and more to do with the fact he‚Äôs 37. Taking the injury into account, the fact he played through that at his age says to me he really wanted this to go out on top.\n\nYeah I agree with this, when Serena was 39 she slipped at Wimbledon and that was pretty much the end.\n\nI think he is gonna play at world cup too\n\nHe‚Äôs for sure coming back to defend the World Cup. Unlike Ronaldo, Messi doesn‚Äôt have the same level ego to need to start every game. He‚Äôs mentioned many times about passing the guard to the next generation. He probably comes back on the condition the team isn‚Äôt built around him.( his wishes) He‚Äôs a late game sub,  and comes on to take penalties in extra time\n\nBallon d‚ÄôAnkle\n\nHis foot was a balloon, Ariel.\n\nBawlewn\n\nBalloon*\n\nYeah that's the joke you halfwit\n\nBalloon*\n\nr/YourJokeButWorse\n\nMy man looking like he's about to go Gear 5 but got stopped half way\n\nThats gear 2\n\n[deleted]\n\nNo that's gear 2 when he's pumping\n\nI think it is fair to say that gear 3 was used in legs as in gomu gomu no gigant axe or gigant thor axe\n\n  \nbut compressing his heart that blood is squeezed all the way to his feet down to (almost) his ankles could also be how he interpreted the picture as gear 2\n\nI always assumed there was a huge overlap of one piece fans and football fans.\n\nI didn't think I'd get quite so many comments and upvotes from me putting the wrong Gear in!\n\nNow he'll never be able to fulfill his potential!\n\nIs this the biggest what-if in sports?\n\nBro.. Mad Respect..\n\nYea only a few people can pull off white socks with slippers.\n\n[removed]\n\nInter Miami's next game is on Wednesday\n\nLuckily, both Miami and Argentina are getting so good nowadays without him, that it kinda makes me both happy and sad at the same time. I will miss this guy so damn much, as an argentinian he is been there my whole childhood all the way to my 20s\n\nMiami just lost 6:1 . 3 of their last matches before that they won just barely .. miami literally needs hin\n\nThey were also missing Su√°rez, alba, Rojas and Gomez. Like 5 starters and Busquets was playing defense.\n\nBarely winning is better than all the loses they had last season before he got there\n\nHe ain't in Europe anymore m8\n\nThat‚Äôs swelling which takes around 1-2 weeks to recover from\n\nAt 37, an ankle injury like that will keep you out of doing any DIY around the house for at least 6 weeks. If that‚Äôs not true then don‚Äôt tell my wife\n\nMaybe but not definitely. Mine have looked like that several times and in a couple weeks it‚Äôs like nothing happened. It could also be a tear or break making it much longer. Need an MRI to know.\n\nYeah, mine looked like that and it was 10 weeks on cruches as a 16 year old. But IIRC it was like a 70% tear.¬†\n\nYeah it can really depend. I grew up skateboarding and swelling like that was sometimes totally resolved in a week and sometimes it took a month. Getting back on a sprained ankle too soon gave me pain for like 6 months once.\n\nAs a doctor on Reddit for 10 years, I can say with 100% certainty that is true. It may take even longer. \n\nI got you king.\n\nThat sounds true for me - a lazy, overweight, 30s, POS. But I'm betting someone in elite athletic condition with unlimited money and best doctors available probably recovers a little bit quicker.\n\nSwelling is due to an underlying cause if its a ligament tear it would take months.\n\nA good ankle brace goes along way but this is Def a 1-2 month minimum\n\nI had something with less swelling and still it took 2 months\n\n1-2 weeks? When was the last time you exercised?\n\nHe‚Äôs definitely out for more than 2 weeks lol. He won‚Äôt even start feeling the pain properly until tomorrow when all the adrenaline drops down.\n\nDamn everyone here is either over exaggerating (destroyed) or under. This will NOT take 1-2 weeks to recover from. Looks like a gnarly sprain but could just as easily be a fracture from the amount and placement of swelling. Only a scan will tell. Either way, he‚Äôll not be able to use it properly for months.\n\nI had a sprain that looked roughly like this last year and was unable to jog for like 3 months. Didn‚Äôt do massive amounts of physio like I‚Äôm sure Messi will but the only thing for it ultimately is rest.\n\n&gt; but the only thing for it ultimately is rest.\n\nThis is absolutely not true. In many cases it's the exact opposite, rest can be literally the worst thing to do for rehab. Complete rest for more than a few days is *almost* always a bad approach to rehab.\n\nLike all of us know at least a few guys who \"have bum knee\" or \"bad back\" because they tore a ligament or herniated a disc more than a decade ago and instead of active rehab they did the exact opposite of resting for weeks and then for the rest of their lives avoided stressing that injured body part. At that point it's more of a self-inflicted weakness than inevitable outcome from a past injury. Meanwhile athletes (and otherpeople taking their physios' advice seriously) are back to near-normal after injuries like that within months.\n\nI'm sure he's getting the best possible care/advice anyway whether this is just a sprain or something else. If it's just a sprain, I doubt it takes months (plural) for him to be back.\n\nYes, but the swelling is obviously from something. Swelling isn‚Äôt an injury, it‚Äôs a symptom.\n\n34 here, I rolled my ankle mountain biking and it swelled up like that. Turns out when you roll them hard you can chip your tibula and fibula. Going on 4 months now and still barely 75 percent healed. Took 3 weeks to walk with it again.\n\nAreed. It will actually look worse in 2-3 days when the fluid drains into the foot and under the skin. His right foot will look like his left calf. Solid black and blue. \n\nFor bad injuries maybe 4-6 weeks to be fully back, but 2-3 weeks is norm before you can do sporty stuff again. The biggest problem for me is control after an injury like this. Everything feels loose for a while, and whatever fine control I have with that foot is gone. Bad touches, under-played balls, etc. And what makes it worse is that to prevent re-injury you need to wear a brace, and if you do it up tight it removes flexibility in your ankle. So you don't have dexterity. Your leg just becomes like a hockey stick. \n\nProbably 6-10 weeks before you're back to somewhat normal level of touch, swelling goes all the way down, etc.\n\nTry 1-2 months\n\nHad a similar swelling when I ruptured Achilles. Took 1 month of walking with crutches and 2 more to recover. Was scared to play football for a couple years after.\n\nHow do you know? I had an ankle injury that had me bedridden with it elevated for over two months. Granted it was pretty severe and took multiple surgeries but still. Ankles are extremely reactive joints.\n\nThat's a good 4 to 6 minimum\n\nAyy? \n\n\"This man's had his skull caved in\" \"That's okay, the swelling will disappear in a week\" \n\nYou understand what swelling is right?\n\nHad one 2 months ago and boy was it so painful and lasted for almost 1 month before I could play properly.\n\nCome back from that in 2 weeks and I give it 30 minutes before you do it again\n\nThat‚Äôs just a swollen ankle.\n\nStill, That mf‚Äôs atleast a month of recovery. \n\nThose hurt like shit\n\nOf course it hurts. My point was that his ankle is anything but destroyed. Strains and sprains, especially in the ankle area, is a pretty common injury. \n\nDepending on the severity, he could be back in full contact training in a week.\n\nHe‚Äôs 37, I seriously doubt he‚Äôll even run within a week, let alone train \n\nBut I guess we‚Äôll see\n\nMessi doesn't need to run. He looks around, scans the pitch\n\nYou're mistaken this with Harry Kane\n\nMan went to Bayern to win some trophies got duped by once In a life time team of Xabi Alonse and leverkeusen..Kane for some reason can‚Äôt seem to catch a break\n\nThou shalt not take the name of the Throphiless thy Goat in vain.\n\ngaze deserve employ sense direction books paint whole cagey tie\n\n *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev/home)*\n\nJonas Vingegaard is riding a Tour de France as one of the favorites to win just 8 weeks after having spent 9 days in the ICU with severely damaged lungs and several broken bones from a crash.\n\nModern medical science combined with the will and discipline of an athlete wanting to be the best can do amazing things.\n\ndrab airport continue subtract workable enjoy chubby unwritten six many\n\n *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev/home)*\n\nI doubt Let alone he wants to run in a week\n\nIm currently working in terrain and a guy fell and had something happen to his ankle. It looked pretty much the same as this yet now 5 days later he‚Äôs back to walking normally, says it hurts but not too much. Messi will be fine\n\nI had similar thing happend to\nMe at work. (Construction) Took 2 days off swelling went away. Back to normal with pain fading week after week. 3 weeks and just a little bit of stiffness but no issues. Redditors and athletic injuries lol.¬†\n\nWhen I was a teen, I had a grade 3 sprain. Two months to be able to walk without pain. 4-5 months to be able to go back on the field. Now that I'm Messi's age, I might as well be put on life support if the same injury happened.\n\nHow do you know? I got a ligament tear last year and it swelled up exactly like this. Took a full year to heal including physiotherapy and surgery.\n\nDidn't you have bruises as soon as you got the tear?\n\nPhysios always told me, no bruises no tear.\n\nThe bruising on my minor tear took 24 hours to show up. Still not right after two months.\n\nSame for my Achilles Tear. Swelled up like this first but bruising came later.\n\nDidn't get proper bruising for probably two days or so when I got a really bad ligament injury on my foot that I got playing soccer. I was just about able to drive myself home with a bit of pain. The next day when I woke up I couldn't walk. The day after that the entire side of my foot was purple.\n\nDo you have his physio team, medical team and experts? These pro athletes have significantly quick injury recovery times because the rest of their body is in perfect shape. His other muscles can cope.\n\nHow did he even walk off the field with that?\n\nI've had both sprained ligaments and a broken ankle, neither one swelled that much, but I wasn't walking with either one.\n\nbro wtf that must hurt so much - bro played on that? wtfff  \nand i cant play when my ankle's just swelled on ONE SIDE let alone BOTH  \nbetter ice and tape that shizzles up\n\nI bet it only swelled up once he took his shoe off, he probably felt fine until he sat down for a bit and the adrenaline wore off, even then he's probably had this type of injury a ton before and you'll be amazed at how much pain relief you get by just being able to stay calm and not worry.\n\nWhen I did mine at first it didn‚Äôt really hurt and I could walk on it, but it didn‚Äôt want to take the weight. Briefly forgot what had happened the next morning and tried to stand on it getting out of bed and I screamed and decided I‚Äôd better go to the hospital.\n\n[removed]\n\nUse the magic spray!\n\nHe just needs to walk it off.\n\nUntil I saw that picture during the match after his exit, I 100% thought that he was b.s.‚Äôing, and took the bench on purpose.  All the ‚Äúomg, I‚Äôm so hurt!‚Äù flops over the years (by any and all futbol players) had me so desensitized to anyone who claimed being hurt, and  with no bones sticking out or gushing blood. Sorry Lionel for doubting you!\n\nMessi is one of those players that doesn't dive very often. Especially when he was younger, there wasn't really a way to stop him except to foul, and even that wasn't a sure chance that he was going to stop\n\nDude was crying that he couldn‚Äôt continue playing‚Ä¶ why would he fake that‚Ä¶?"

The same ish happened when KDB was out last season, he‚Äôs just balling off of excellent service\n\n8 expect goals seems excellent service?\n\nPrime example of someone who is talking about stuff without thinking or knowledge about it.\n\nIk Rodri is hurt for the long term but whats up w Kdb?\n\nOld\n\nDamnnn hate to hear it. Hes had a helluva run tho\n\nAnd no functional joints in his lower body\n\n‚Ä¶ but not that old‚Ä¶\n\nOver rated just like Odeargard. Great blond hopes\n\nScores just fine for Norway and Dortmund\n\nah yes because halaand really struggled to score before City\n\nHe had similar stats in Borussia Dortmund, you're just saying BS at this point.\n\nKevin is also highly over rated, just the great blond hope. Are they still not losing with De Bruyne back in the team. How many goals or assist does he contribute every season?\n\nStick by his comments\n\nArteta cursed him üòÇ üòÇ üòÇ... Arteta didn't say anything to him but his silence was like a curse to him.¬†\n\nIn his silence within his own mind he heard \"stay thumble\" that's the curse.¬†¬†\n\nIf it's man citeh we can circle jerk anywhere\n\nI can't believe how quickly he became a heel\n\nBro worked himself into a shoot.\n\nMuch love -HH\n\nAlways was\n\nCertainly looks the part\n\nBrock Lesnar regen\n\nüòÇ\n\n[https://images.app.goo.gl/UZpeKTuSZsNCVwRf7](https://images.app.goo.gl/UZpeKTuSZsNCVwRf7)\n\ndont compare lesnar to this cringelord\n\nI dunno. Most heels can grow facial hair¬†\n\nI like to picture Erling as the meditating Haaland that belted those goals in on the BVB vs PSG champions league match, before PSG came back round and set Dortmund down.\n\nKeep your wrassling Out of My FOOTBALL\n\nhe looks kinda like Zlatan's evil twin, in a weird sort of way\n\nZlatan is already evil though\n\nhaha good point. I guess Zlatan's albino long-lost twin, also evil\n\nStay humble eh!\n\nnarratives are crazy aren‚Äôt they\n\nDid you think he was ever a babyface??\n\nThe weird Brock-Lesnar-looking guy? He was always going to be a heel.\n\nStay humble, eh?\n\n12 goals in 12 premier league games, btw.\n\nSuch a bizarre thing to say after drawing at home.\n\nTo 10 men. While belittling others in pretty much the same breath.\n\nThey were probably getting each other fired up before the game, \"we are going to humble these guys and get in their head\" kind of thing, and then it ends in a draw at home to 10 men defending and frustrating the big man.\n\nI wonder if he ended up getting in his own head after the anger and frustration settled. Not saying he is or isn't a tool, don't know the bloke, but in that moment damn if he wasn't the whole tool box in front of half the bloody planet. That's got to leave a mark anyone.\n\nWell his dad is a tool, no reason to believe he didn‚Äôt inherit some of that himself\n\nHe also was lucky to be unpunished for deliberately throwing the ball at Gabriel‚Äôs head. Behind his back too which lets you know the kind of Bitch he is.\n\nI find this funny because it has 115 upvotes\n\nThe consequences of that 115 chargers is looming. Let's keep our fingers crossed and see what goes down.¬†\n\nAnd when Arsenal were barely seconds away from winning.\n\nNot really\n\nEras come to end, eh?\n\n[deleted]\n\nits a joke\n\nOk wanna hear better joke? Man City\n\nBro actually stayed humble\n\nI'm sure he'll start banging them in for fun within the month. Probably starting next week.\n\nBut until then I'm very much enjoying his little ego check.\n\nHe will bang them for sure once he starts playing vs teams like Luton.\n\nrespect Luton\n\nOr I retire\n\nAfter City‚Äôs relegation?\n\nGive me freedom, give me fire, give me Luton or I retire!\n\nnext week, against van Dijk and Konate?\n\nIm scared for my Feyenoord. Sure they look weaker than ever, but that 0-4 must have hurt.\n\nComment aged like milk but I‚Äôm glad\n\nYou guys have the chance to do the funniest thing. How do you chant \"sacked in the morning\" in dutch?\n\nThe fundamental question is, will Haaland start scoring goals like he was? And he will be, even more so. But until he is, it‚Äôs going to be hard to verify that I think he‚Äôll start scoring again.\n\nCity are in a stagmire right now.\n\nHe's at the precipice of an enormous crossroads.\n\nMan City owners. The sacred and the propane. 115 charges whateva happened there...\n\nr/unexpectedlittlecarmine\n\nA pint of goals is worth more than a gallon of POTM awards.\n\nCity will get battered by Liverpool and will score 0 goals against them so no not happening next week.\n\nSubscribe\n\nHe's still my FPL captain and will stay that unless he gets injured. I'm scared to remove him as I know what will happen.\n\nYeah it just goes to show city haven‚Äôt actually been that woeful in this run and nobody should be writing them off at all. \n\nOr put another way, them losing 5 straight is even more hilarious\n\nWhoreland is not doing anything next week\n\nStay corrupt eh\n\nHahaha what a cunt he is. Perfect for City.\n\nDude is woefully inept outside the box and like someone else said, when he stops scoring goals he offers nothing else. Absolutely insane that people think he deserves balandor. Better players have failed to win that award\n\nThe mpaypal and Haaland fall off from the next generation of ‚Äúmessi vs Ronaldo‚Äù has been legendary\n\nAt Dortmund he was a much more dangerous player I feel\n\nNah his first season at city was mental\n\nYeah he was actually converting the silver platter chances he was served.¬†\n\nSeems a bit diminutive but that‚Äôs true\n\nHe simply was not\n\nApart from goals, he offers nothing. And when he can't score goals, then a traffic cone is better than him.\n\nMaybe Roy Keane was right all along‚Ä¶\n\nWhat did he say?\n\nbasically \"Harlaad is a word class scorer with league 2 ability everywhere else\".\n\nI'm by no means a lover of man city, quite the opposite. However if my striker is banging in as many goals as haaland has been, I'd forgive them for not being too involved otherwise. The numbers he's put out the last couple of years is mental\n\nThe Haaland &amp; Mbappe fall off is legendary. From new dominant duo for the next decade to mister trafic cone and offside.\n\nMbappe in particular is shocking.\n\ni mean mbappe got all the attributes, what's holding him back atm might his mental or tactics, maybe even both\n\nreal madrid simply going down the galacticos 2.0 or wha i like to call the fifa career mentality of hoarding all the best as a strategy\n\nstrong as much as you want on paper, but you cannot use 11 attackers in football\n\nI don‚Äôt think Mbappe likes playing in a league where his side has to work for a win. I feel like PSG is so dominant in Ligue 1 that he has never actually had to put in a ton of effort to get the win and now he‚Äôs in a league with other good teams he just can‚Äôt keep up. Skipping internationals as the captain just goes to show his mentality is not that of a world class footballer.\n\nNot much of a difference between La Liga and Ligue 1 in terms of the gap between the top and middle teams. Only real difference is La Liga has Barca, Real and Atletico while Ligue 1 only has PSG. No one outside of those 3 spanish teams has won the title in 20 years. The whole sport is a joke.\n\nI mean even by your own standard, that is three times the talent of Ligue 1, but imo the quality in La Liga is a lot deeper than Ligue 1. Of the major European leagues I think it has some of the most interesting clubs to watch up and down the table. I mostly follow the EPL closest but if I'm watching another league it's that and Bundesliga.\n\nIndeed, an absolute donkey shooting aside. Flat track bully getting found out fast.\n\nPeople saying he deserved a ballon d‚Äôor was always wild to me. He broke the scoring record sure, he also failed to perform in all the important matches in Champions League and FA Cup, and now we‚Äôre seeing his impact when his teammates play under level\n\nExactly. Like they can't convince without trophies or stats why he was actually better than messi. It's the best player, not goalscorer\n\nPads his stats against relegation sides. Bro was the third best player on his team that season.\n\nApart from the defining factor in winning matches, he offers nothing.\n\nGenius take.\n\nliterally lmao what does striker need to do ,just score if they can do that perfectly he is a great player,these guys man sometimes I don't understand wtf expectations they have for every single player\n\nTo think he was voted the 5 best player in the word is amazing\n\nThats a pretty dumb statement considering goals are the most important thing in the game.\n\nLife comes to you fast\n\nHumblebox\n\nGuys, just wanna say it‚Äôs been an absolutely wild prediction in FPL for me, transferred him out weeks ago\n\nPlayer has bad run of form. Has that ever happened before?\n\nHe‚Äôs still comfortably the top scorer in the Premier League and will almost certainly have a golden boot at the end of the season if he doesn‚Äôt get injured.\n\nThe point is not about bad run or form in isolation but the bad run of form coming right after he displayed exceptional amount of ego to tell an opposition manager to ‚Äústay humble‚Äù after a match they drew at home and were seconds away from lesson. An opposition manager that has never said one bad word about you as a player and gave so much of his life to your club. \n\nThat is what this is about. Not a loss of form in isolation.\n\nYou missed the point entirely mate\n\nSaid this a little while ago whilst everyone was jerking him to score 60 league goals or some bull shit\n\nDownvotes ahoy. Turns out you can‚Äôt do that in the EPL. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/s/qmsLuuIScK\n\nlmao ppl downvoting u = braindead\n\nonly messi could realistically do that\n\neh?\n\nHe‚Äôs a big fud. Get it round him\n\nHonestly, yesterday's game he didn't get any service so i can't blame him. But yeah he tend to ghost in big games\n\nBro taking his own advice\n\nGreat to see Arsenal win a trophy\n\nGood advice from Haaland, if only he were talking to a mirror.\n\nHe‚Äôs still comfortably first in the top scorer charts despite missing all those goals\n\nHe's up 2 goals on Salah despite 13.3 to 8.5 xg. Salah has 6 assists to his 0 as well. \n\nHe may be in first, but it's because he's had way more good chances than anyone else.\n\nHumbling!\n\nAnd people give Darwin Nunez a hard time‚Ä¶.\n\nIt‚Äôs strange that both Halland and Mbappe are struggling, even though they were named next biggest rivalry\n\nHe should apologize. Seen the Yaya Toure curse work and this could be one.\n\nHe looks like a bad version of the guy from house of dragon\n\nHe never was a face, he was always a heel. A face creates his own chances and scores. A heel comes in when all the work‚Äôs already been done to tap it in and take credit.\n\nStay humble &lt; being humbled\n\nMan leads by example.\n\nOnly fanbois that have his posters on the wall think he‚Äôs a complete footballer. His technical skills are limited to positioning and shooting only. He can‚Äôt dribble, he can‚Äôt win 1v1 ground duels, he has no vision beyond roaming the box, he can‚Äôt control the ball under pressure, his passing is mediocre, he is very stiff and rigid, barely any creative skills. Sure, he has been great as a traditional striker who you could compare Ruud Van Nistelrooy, only without RVN‚Äôs creativity and dribbling skills. I admit, he is a goal scoring beast but part of that has been due to the teams he was allowed to play in. Nah, he‚Äôs one of the most overrated players of all time and I will personally never enjoy attackers like him. He‚Äôs effective as fuck, sure. But he‚Äôs not a complete footballer / attacker.\n\ndark arts\n\nThat new contract though‚Ä¶.\n\nBeing an United fan, I‚Äôm loving this phase in city‚Äôs football.\n\nConsider him HUMBLED.\n\nFlexin\n\nIm sure he‚Äôll just stop being the games arguable best CF because of this minuscule stat.\n\nSports are more fun with characters. Especially extremely talented ones. Its supposed to be entertaining. \n\nAlso fuck manchester city.\n\nVAR is dead. Long live VAR\n\n[deleted]\n\n[deleted]\n\n[deleted]\n\nStill a treble winner\n\nCrybaby man-child\n\nGotta laugh at all these comments talking about how Haalands supposedly bad without KDB/Rodri. I'm a Chelsea fan but he's been excellent in a majority of City's loses and unlucky to not score, keepers have pulled off some terrific saves and he's hit post/crossbar a few times. He's also gotten himself into great positions only to get ignored by players like Gundo (literally happened v Tottenham). I genuinely can't tell if people that think Haaland is a bad player are just memeing or if they're genuinely idiots.\n\ntwat\n\ntap in merchant that gets pocketed by van dijk\n\nNo 1 in all 5 leagues in xH (expected humility)\n\nfuck that guy\n\n.\n\nHope we all don‚Äôt conveniently forget these stats come May.\n\nThe XG is right there broüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ\nThe hate is real.\n\nStay humble :)\n\nStill the top scorer. Thats crazy.\n\nHe's yet to suffer the full extent of karma. Let's see if they get relegated. He will stay very humble by then.¬†\n\nBut on the other hand that means, that he had 5.37 xG and 10 goals (incl. Arsenal match).\n\nHow is city still higher than assna?\n\nArteta was being a bad winner celebrating right in the City players faces.\n\nHe was being a dick and a lot worse could have been said.\n\nFair play to Haaland for calling him out.\n\nstay humble eh\n\nNeeds to be accompanied by a photo of that fat Haaland fella from Eastenders I think.\n\nThe shear amount of references from Arsenal fans shows just how much that comment from Haarland hurt.\n\n!remindme 96 days\n\nI will be messaging you in 3 months on [**2025-03-02 07:14:29 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2025-03-02%2007:14:29%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) to remind you of [**this link**](https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/1gykgls/erling_haaland_has_scored_2_goals_from_803xg_in/lz1hvhu/?context=3)\n\n[**CLICK THIS LINK**](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&amp;subject=Reminder&amp;message=%5Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2Ffootball%2Fcomments%2F1gykgls%2Ferling_haaland_has_scored_2_goals_from_803xg_in%2Flz1hvhu%2F%5D%0A%0ARemindMe%21%202025-03-02%2007%3A14%3A29%20UTC) to send a PM to also be reminded and to reduce spam.\n\n^(Parent commenter can ) [^(delete this message to hide from others.)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&amp;subject=Delete%20Comment&amp;message=Delete%21%201gykgls)\n\n*****\n\n|[^(Info)](https://www.reddit.com/r/RemindMeBot/comments/e1bko7/remindmebot_info_v21/)|[^(Custom)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&amp;subject=Reminder&amp;message=%5BLink%20or%20message%20inside%20square%20brackets%5D%0A%0ARemindMe%21%20Time%20period%20here)|[^(Your Reminders)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&amp;subject=List%20Of%20Reminders&amp;message=MyReminders%21)|[^(Feedback)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=Watchful1&amp;subject=RemindMeBot%20Feedback)|\n|-|-|-|-|\n\n!remindme 192 days\n\nI'm really sorry about replying to this so late.

I can enjoy both.\n\nThis is Football, everyone celebrates any minor rivalries shortcomings no matter how brief they are :)\n\nI get that, but go look at the Arsenal subs, its outright obsession over there\n\nBecause seeing Haaland struggle after he was a bit of a twat to Arteta makes it all the more sweet right? I know its bittersweet given they're still they're still second in the table but it is a nice feeling.\n\nYou're a City fan, you telling me United getting spanked by Liverpool 7-0 didn't cause a single thread to be created on the city subreddit?\n\n&gt;Because seeing Haaland struggle after he was a bit of a twat to Arteta makes it all the more sweet right? I know its bittersweet given they're still they're still second in the table but it is a nice feeling\n\nIts ironic for sure. But like, the guy still leads the league. Its making fun of the dude driving a lambo because he has a flat tire, while youre in your ford escort.\n\n&gt;You're a City fan\n\nI am not a City fan. \n\nI am a Bayern Munich fan cause i grew up in the area, played academy and even trained under Pep on a few instances, so i am certainly biased, sure, but it aint that deep that i would know whether the City sub had a thread for that or not. Even if they did, wouldnt you agree that there is a difference between a single thread and pretty much daily new posts?\n\nSo if I understand correctly you think haaland lives rent free in the arsenal sub which you for some reason are checking out daily?\n\nI dont think thats the gotcha you think it is. Yes, i follow every PL teams sub for news and updates, thus naturally more PL related subs show up in my timeline. \nA quick look at the Arsenal sub i mentioned and their popular posts shows, how obsessed they are with City.\n\nIts not that deep. You know you can sort posts on a sub right? You dont have to check in daily.\n\nI'm not having a go at you mate, if anything your reply proves that people comment on other teams in their own subs as well as on rival subs.\n\nNobody denies that tho?\n\nMy point is, that a fandom posting about another team at that frequency is obsession. Not sure what that has to do with what youre saying.\n\n[deleted]\n\nThey are currently our main rivals, of course there would be lots of posts and comments on the sub.\n\n[deleted]\n\nYeah it's enjoying the schadenfreude of a vain person.\n\nAlso I trained under Roy Hodgson who's forgotten more than Pep will ever know, so have that.\n\nThe team that cheated to 4 straight titles, robbing us of 2, then barely scraped out a shitty draw off a terrible red card from a ref literally on City's owners' payroll (you'd think I was exaggerating, but that's a factual statement), where Haaland then told Arsenal to be humble? Gee I wonder why we talk about City? \n\nI guess the people saying plastic is bad for your brain were right...\n\nSigh. Its always a yank\n\n1) I don't think anyone is celebrating City's struggles more than their own team's success. Observe any fan and see how they react when their team scores vs when City concede. There's levels.¬†\n\n\n2) Despite cheating for the best part of a decade, City are still in 2nd. There's levels.¬†\n\n\n3) Nobody takes City's trophies seriously apart from City fans. It's why Liverpool and United will always be bigger clubs than some sheikh's juiced up plaything. There's levels.\n\n&gt;I don't think anyone is celebrating City's struggles more than their own team's success. Observe any fan and see how they react when their team scores vs when City concede. There's levels.¬†\n\nThats why the Arsenal subs are flooded with new City posts every single day?\n\n&gt;Despite cheating for the best part of a decade, City are still in 2nd. There's levels.¬†\n\nI dont get the point youre trying to make here? They won 4 league titles in a row, going for a 5th. They also just won a treble and their players just got won the BdO. Its not like theyve been starved for success.\n\n&gt;Nobody takes City's trophies seriously apart from City fans. It's why Liverpool and United will always be bigger clubs than some sheikh's juiced up playing. There's levels.\n\nIts funny how many people can say \"nobody cares about City\" while simultaneously dedicate a lot of time to City and hoping for them to stop winning.\n\nYou said people are celebrating City's struggles MORE than their own team's successes. I just had a look at the Gunners subreddit and scrolled down FIFTY posts. Not a single City post, unless you count their PL Rivals thread. So either you're just lying, or being hyperbolic.\n\nI didnt say \"nobody cares about City\". Most people DO care because if it wasn't for City cheating, three teams would have more PL title wins. And Inter would have their 4th European title. What I said is that no-one takes your titles seriously because they weren't earned fairly. You're the Lance Armstrong of football clubs and no amount of sportswashing or legal diversions are gonna stop that.\n\nHonest question - is your username supposed to be ironic? Because if you think City are innocent of what they've been accused of, realism sure ain't a character trait that you should be promoting.\n\nWhere's your proof of this alleged cheating?\n\ncry\n\nwhen cheaters lose it is a win for all of football\n\nIt‚Äôs funny that with city‚Äôs worst form in 10 years, they‚Äôre still ahead of 18 teams in the league\n\nYep. Haaland still leads the league in scoring. They are still in the race for winning their 5th straight title. \nAll that while being incredibly unlucky with injuries this season. \n\nSo yes, a lot of fans laughing at City  to the extent they do probably should kinda turn it down a bit considering the state of their respective teams.\n\nIncredibly unlucky, lose one player only...\n\nWhat? You can hate City all you want but youre either daft, at worst, or disingenuous, at best.\n\nThey lost Rodri, their most important player. They also still miss Dias and Doku. Kovacic just got injured. Ake and Stones just came back. \nKdB is on his way back. \nLike, lets not act like they werent missing half their starting line up to start the season.\n\nThat's why clubs are given 25-man squad. don't complain about injuries dude. The truth is man city's squad is aging &amp; they didn't bring in players of similar credentials to replace them. Either that or players are reluctant to join because of the impending 115 case."

Such an iconic game and those guys just being all calm while it's gone on kinda represents the eye of the storm for me.\n\nNow I must re-watch the battle of Nuremberg again...\n\nPls share link if you have\n\nI call this painting \"the beauty and the beast\" for obvious reasons.\n\nThis being said the best photo ever is R9 with Brazil dribbling while Maldini and Cannavarro are tackling him.\n\nhttps://s2-ge.glbimg.com/4yqQJOsIofY8v4RVF3pycIp5IIM=/0x0:4149x2781/600x0/smart/filters:gifv():strip_icc()/i.s3.glbimg.com/v1/AUTH_bc8228b6673f488aa253bbcb03c80ec5/internal_photos/bs/2020/E/I/SwYDzlSFeZeBLCBHrnSQ/gettyimages-635973395.jpg\n\nThat Ronaldo photo is absolutely amazing, can‚Äôt believe I have never seen it\n\nIt's been my wallpaper for decades!\n\nMiss black boots, they were so clean\n\nMaldini and Cannavaro going full Vegeta\n\nLegends\n\nAgree, but as a Benfica and Maestro fan im sus....\n\nü¶Ö\n\nVinnie Jones grabbing Gazza's balls would like a word...\n\nPictures can't talk mate\n\nThat one does\n\nWhat did it say?\n\nProbably 'ow'\n\nhttps://www.nssmag.com/en/sports/17340/vinnie-jones-e-la-violenza-come-brand-di-successo\n\nThe is the correct answer and you had 1 upvote.\n\nThat one time Materazzi used his elbow for good.\n\nRui Costa is one of the most underrated players of all time. A midfield magician.\n\nUsed to be the wallpaper on my phone lol. Iconic\n\nI have it as my wallpaper right now\n\nI had a poster stick to my wall. This is definitely the mona lisa of football pictures.\n\nRui Costa a true number 10, always reminded me of Al Pacino.\n\nThis pic goes hard\n\nFor:\n\nBobby More / Pele swapping shirts after an epic World Cup game in 1970. There is so much respect for each other after a brilliant battle.\n\nEric Cantona kung-fu kick. Was insane when it happened.\n\nTheiry Henry knee slide in front of Spurs fans. Such an iconic photo that they made a statue out of it.\n\nNope materazzi is a prick. \n\nRui Costa on the other hand is a legend.\n\nYou want at least one prick in your team to unsettle the other guy. He played that role perfectly.\n\nYeah. Even this famous picture is a power play. Him resting his arm on Costa's shoulder is subtly asserting his dominance.\n\nYou are overthinking it\n\nI don't think I am. He may not even consciously realise he is doing it. But it suggests confidence, power, and control.\n\nMakes sense, I'm sure you can't fully turn off the shithousery like a tap mid-match.\n\nHe's just taller lol. I don't think he's doing that at all.\n\nA prick and a legend*\n\nLegend and nice guy are not synonymous\n\nThere‚Äôs few who break that way of thinking but yeh for the most part, you need to be a specific type of person to get to that level.\n\nNever said they were. Materazzi is no legend. Only  known because of zizu.\n\nAs a player, yes. As Benfica's president, prick.\n\nShut up\n\n[This is my favorite](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:828/format:webp/1*CwKE8GQJ4Mi12rcHquaDNA.jpeg)\n\nAlways gets on my nerves when people lean on me like that.

Inter Milan scored a goal which was disallowed immediately, prompting the Inter fans to throw fireworks into the stadium. The game later continued, on and off, but was abandoned after the fans become uncontrollable, with AC milan being awarded a 3-0 victory.\n\n@portugalcaralho\n\nAgree!\n\nNo. Simply because Materazzi is in it.\n\nüî•üî•\n\nIf you have a taller friend he probably rested his arm on your shoulder like that many times.\n\nZvonimir Boban hitting a policeman is my top pick of all time:\n\n\nhttps://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-m&amp;sca_esv=ca7c2e124c262a66&amp;sca_upv=1&amp;q=zvonimir+boban+udara+policajca&amp;uds=AMwkrPvFkBShrRODY5zFosSSAXPfVlYHjlJlKh2pdMvhHVAZWHv_IhwfRZPfnTbcQBtvSMXuyqVjor07yi31JYpD-H078k9AdnpYosjVnOZZCdrF80f1HmGXM_P996qy75Ahpc-JUdKRHn-hcaldk2u0l_z2Wt4BKrt-xqJCzbiZyo2idrMC-Yz2XnhfNNSVl7Z7l4NRRYZfokG-b4dmlnWqpIp4cUsLZ0QFRkSxA9onYT6h53GxPo-rXrTC10VmiNBVfYyY21ha&amp;udm=2&amp;prmd=ivbz&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwif9Ya9qr-FAxVUwAIHHdXLAkEQtKgLegQIChAB&amp;biw=131&amp;bih=250&amp;dpr=2.86#vhid=oAzRqB2VxwOqMM&amp;vssid=mosaic\n\nThose boots as well. Gold mercurial vapors and OG colourway predators, can't beat it!\n\nDisagree. Great pic of all time is Vinnie Jones grabbing Gazza‚Äôs balls.\n\nMan, i remember this game well\n\nYes\n\nWhy can‚Äôt the Milan Derby from last season at the Champions League do this too!?\n\nOh, It‚Äôs my wallpapers!\n\nCorner taken quickly is superior\n\nSome people , just want to watch the world burn\n\nDisagree because there's videos of Materazzi kicking Rui Costa while he was on the floor. Probably from the same match as this picture. So this wasn't genuine.\n\n[This is oneof my favourites. ](https://i.imgur.com/3Byd3ri.jpg)\n\nhttps://www.scotsman.com/webimg/legacy_elm_38598588.jpg?width=1200&amp;enable=upscale\n\nDave Mackay pulling up Billy Bremner for a bad challenge.

They don‚Äôt have a fondness for Materazzi\n\nThis was my desktop wallpaper for years\n\nagree, iconic\n\nThe hand of god has to be up there with one of the best photos ever taken in football!\n\nWithout materazzi, probably yes\n\nVery sad that a lot of people nowadays don‚Äôt know how good Rui Costa was, underrated legend. Rui could‚Äôve been the best if he wasn‚Äôt blinded by loyalty to his club Benfica, the most loyal player ever.\n\nMy favorite football picture of all time is where Ronaldinho was holding the ball with his head in Brazil training\n\nCold AF ü•∂ü•∂‚òùüèΩ‚òùüèΩ\n\nWas this the 2005 UCL QF?\n\nA son of a bitch next to a real footballer.\n\nAgreeeeee\n\nWho will win the premier league cup?\n\nOr Vinnie Jones grabbing Gazza by the Knackers and making him squeal\n\nagreed\n\nFantastic photo. Similar to the Tour de France canteen pic.\n\nwhy is that 6 foot tall stack of shit leaning on that Portuguese fella? i didnt know they stacked shit that high.\n\nIt‚Äôs up there as the all time great, imagine a derby where both sides are getting to war yet there was still a room for such iconic moment.\n\nVery good photo\n\nLooks badass, the thing that makes the picture great is that two players are from rival teams\n\nDisagree, gotta be Vinnie grabbing Gazza‚Äôs jangles.\n\nRui is underrated should be and icon in fifa\n\nThis is actually fire\n\n I just made it my wallpaper\n\nToo good‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nFully agree\n\nI have this as my phone lockscreen\n\nGoatsüêê\n\nMessi 5-0 might argue\n\nChill guys\n\nBlah. Overrated photo\n\nUnfortunately Materazzi is in the pic‚Ä¶\n\nThing is I can't help but wonder what Materazzi was whispering in Rui Costa's ears. Possibly the only other time that most of us saw him doing that he ended up getting headbutted by Zidane. So is this one of the greatest football pics of all times? I have my doubts.\n\n&gt;Thing is I can't help but wonder what Materazzi was whispering in Rui Costa's ears.\n\n*What do you think I should say to Zidane if ever I come across him in a World Cup Final?*\n\nWhat about Ale and Maldini ?\n\nhttps://images.app.goo.gl/fTzvQwGi8DfRR2N7A\nhttps://images.app.goo.gl/ThMRb3eTHvtM2RL48\n\nDisagree because this is not a pure moment of fraternity going beyond sports rivalries - they were watching the chaos brought upon by ultras wreaking havoc and suspending a match.\n\nI mean, the photo itself is nice, but as I said - they were not being buddies admiring a great coreography. They were watching powerless the match being suspended because of ultras figuratively \"burning down the stadium\".\n\n100% top 3\n\nBut Baggio \"Dying standing\" photo takes It\n\nballers\n\nNice photo but one of the greatest? No chance.\n\nPost another that is not just superior but on a whole different level then.\n\nQuite a few people already have, check the comments\n\nEh?\n\nMaterazzi is flaccid, so no\n\nDisagree cos that prick Materazzi is in it. \nGreat photo though.\n\ndeffo the greatest non-final photo\n\nAbsolutely great photo\n\nDefinitely the hardest\n\nThis is soccer and not football.\n\nAlso, I have never heard of who these people are.\n\nDisagree\n\nDisagree cuz materazzi. Not only a shitty player but also quite possibly the definition of human scum in every aspect\n\nVinnie Jones grabbing Gazza's balls would like a word...\n\nCompletely disagree.\n\nVinnie Jones grabbing Gazza's balls would like a word...\n\nNot even close‚Ä¶\n\nThe shot of cheating Roma players berating the Dundee Utd coaching staff after their European Cup semi final win in 1984 is the best.\n\nThis looks mid asf wdym"

Nothings gonna happen.\n\nI'm Italian and everyone thought the same in 2006, but then Juventus got relegated to Serie B.\n\nEven a broken clock hits its mark twice a day.\n\nNo need to meme Everton anymore, this year they are going down by themselves\n\nIndirectly from their fines and PSR funnily enough, they can't get a replacement for a 40 year old RB.\n\nUnited went over the limit by nearly the exact same amount.\n\nThat's the issue here. Stop dangling a carrot just to rip it away.\n\nGood old journalism\n\nI doubt anything other than a giant fine (easily paid) and maybe a window ban.\n\nJanuary I‚Äôm sure\n\nTransfer ban from January 31st to June 30th 2025\n\nFor Everton\n\nMost likely. \n\nOi, you spent more than your business legitimately earns! Here's a fine to make this all go away (aka give us our cut), and a window ban which is for the people (and is essentially useless because they've already got the best squad).\n\nno, its a bit more serious than that. that they cheated has already been proven, its the depth and scale of their organised cheating( along with their lack of co operation in the investigation) and the resulting corruption of the premier league thats the issue so i dont think a fine will satisfy the other 19 clubs. cant wait! everton and forest are never gonna be ok with a fine are they? there has to be action on state ownership of clubs and sponsorship sources going forward as well. league is not in a good place right now IMO\n\nOh I agree wholeheartedly. United fans (and to a lesser degree other fans) know full well the extent of their cheating, the issue is whether the punishment will match the crime. The problem is, if they get a points hit or booted out of the league, I've heard the the premier league and football league operate separately, so the worst punishment they could get is one relegation. Well give them one year in the championship and the following year they will be back to the top of the premier league again. The issue is, that the damage is already done. They are unfortunately an established club now with a new generation of followers, any punishement will be but a blip in their modern history. You can't reverse the past, but an appropriate punishment could go some way towards it. I may be biased, but I only see a multiple league relegation as suitable. Relegated out of the professional football league would take them at minimum 5 years until they were back on top, possibly longer whilst they rebuild.\n\nOr they will announce now that there is a ban for summer 2025, so they can do extra shopping next winter.\n\nYe, in the end it will be a ‚Äúnever seen before‚Äù 12.5 million fine or some shit.\n\nFuck off Qatari\n\nThey will literally walk away unscathed. They'll be fined and that's that.\n\nAfter dragging it through the courts for at least 5 years of course\n\nThey definitely won't. Stop being a defeatist.\n\nWould be kinda epic if that actually happened!\n\nImagine all the players's departures, especially Rodri after all his words about fighting for the team, etc.\n\n\\*starts daydreaming\\*\n\nI mean, if UEFA keeps them around then that‚Äôs surely the easiest Champions League ever?\n\nHow?\n\nI think he's implying that they'll be constantly rested.\n\nCompletely missing the fact they'd all have to have massive wage cuts and leave to play elsewhere.\n\nAlso a lack of competitive games would likely outweigh any advantage from being rested.\n\nExactly. They'd be about as sharp as a hammer.\n\nAbout as sharp as Grealish in a maths exam\n\nPep said he would stay at City even if they relegate!!\n\nPep said at the end of last season that this season was his last, he knew the charges were coming ü§£\n\nJust straight waffle ü§£ He never said this.\n\nI think a thing this big will never happen\n\nYea, i would be celebrating\n\nI'd be sitting here eating popcorn.\n\nI'd go get wasted and get the biggest hangover the next day\n\nAs Liam would say: BIBLICAL\n\nI'll be happy if they relegate them to the lowest tier and start the year with -200 points. And strop from all titals.\n\nYou and I both know the Saudis wont let that happen\n\nUAE\n\nSaudi wont mind they own Newcastle? Also they have run a much more fair way since they took over. They are being much more wiser.\n\nBecause they were late to the party.\n\nIf they had come when Chelsea were brought or City they would have done the same\n\nMaybe I‚Äòm in the minority, but while I despise the money put into Chelsea in 2003 or whenever it was, I don‚Äòt really think they did much wrong. It was legal at the time and there were no rules against it.\n\nThe reason City should suffer is because they broke the rules and tried to hide it for as long as possible. They deliberately fudge numbers and withhold information, they are cheaters. There are rules now that they are actively breaking. This behaviour should not be tolerated.\n\nWrong country\n\nThey not owned by Saudis .. and they couldn't stop it even if they did.\n\nI really think a harsh sentence here is the only way to restore a bit of credibility to the game. I honestly think forced sales of clubs that breach financial rules to this level is the only truly appropriate response. City have built a global brand whilst cheating that will stick around long after any punishment.\n\nEven relegation to League 2 or below won't make a big change. They would get 3 promotions in a row even if all of their current players left.\n\nHaaland smashing that League 2 goal record\n\nHaaland figured out how to score more career goals than Ronaldo\n\nHe might beat the record by 2 times or more\n\nYes but it would be funny laughing at City fans at least.\n\nUntil they start styling all over the PL again in a few years.\n\nI mean 3 years of no premier league and having to rebuild your entire squad because those players left to the premier league would be quite the punishment.\n\nNot that it would happen, but you actually think 3 years out of the premier league would do nothing? You‚Äôre deluded, hypothetically of course, they would lose players and sponsorship, zero European football and less tv rights.\n\nI don't think it would be harsh at all,it should be the minimum,but nothing is happening to them other than a fine\n\nJust a fine would mean the value of cheating is worth it.\n\nThis is how wealthy people see fines, literally just the price of getting what you want.\n\nIt even starts before multi millionaires.\n\nI know several people who pay 10k+ yearly for speeding fines where every fine is 50-150‚Ç¨ each.\n\nThese people have a different mindset, it‚Äôs absurd.\n\nYeah it‚Äôs meant to be a sport. Sport is supposed to be about achieving excellence through fairness, honesty and integrity. Everything they are doing undermines that.\n\nI agree. State owned clubs have an unfair advantage. It's not fair to anyone in the league or the football pyramid for that matter, it's legalized cheating. Add to that the multi club ownership which is the norm now, only increases the corruption in football.\n\n&gt; State owned clubs\n\nThat's not what they're on trial for.\n\nHonest question: What is your opinion then on clubs sponsored by Fly Emirates, Qatar Airways and Gazprom who are all state owned companies? They also funnel quite a lot of so called 'state money' into football clubs.\n\nThey don't own them. Legitimate sponsorship is one thing. Ownership and sponsoring yourself is something completely different. Especially when the sponsorship is beyond the realms of normal.\n\nI don‚Äôt disagree but I think we need to think about who were punishing. People at the top of the club made decisions to use money this way and if they‚Äôve done it illegally then they are the guilty ones. Absolutely City could be out of the premier league, but people are talking about taking a football club away from innocent supporters over rules broken by executives and that just feels wrong to me\n\nIt won‚Äôt happen.\n\nThe EPL has already decided to accept money to grant legitimacy to the slave system in a trench coat in Abu Dhabi.\n\nThey can‚Äôt send the message that such investments are not safe\n\nThis. City will get away with a slap on the wrists and a large fine to fund the FA Christmas party.\n\nThis!\n\nSlap on the wrist and both parties will go on their merry ways.\n\nThat said, how City even can pretend to be innocent is of course nothing but insanity. Double height pitch-side advertising from a dozen or so AD owned companies that have no business spending millions on football advertising. They're not fooling anyone and they don't even seem to care.\n\nThe possibility of this happening is lower than surviving a polar bear attack unarmed\n\nSo you're saying there's a chance?\n\nAnything can happen, but the chances of it happening is close to 0\n\nThe odds of getting killed in a radioactive duck attack while you‚Äôre in the bath are astromically low‚Ä¶ but never zero.\n\nMate, you would have NO chance against a polar bear, with or without your arms!\n\nIf they can't even deduct points from Leicester because they were technically in the Championship when the 22-23 financial year ended, I doubt the Premier League could do more than relegate City and strip the titles\n\nBut City can hardly argue they weren‚Äôt in the premier league can they\n\nThen do it. Fuckers deserve it the cheating cucks\n\nBut city can‚Äôt argue they weren‚Äôt in the premier league can they\n\nDoes that mean the league cup 2019/20 goes to Villa? Asking for a friend üëÄ\n\nDon't tease us like that.\n\nGetting rid of one corrupt team to let the other corrupt teams fight again really does sum up the premier league tbf\n\nIt‚Äôs gonna be pro cycling and Lance Armstrong all over again. Chastize the most successful guy while also admitting nobody can be awarded his honours because everyone else ran workarounds too¬†\n\n[deleted]\n\nDidn't Chelsea just sell themselves some hotels ...\n\nThat's not against the rules.\n\nShould they have been allowed to?? They were not sustainable yet they basically generated 76 million pounds from themselves instead of selling players to cover it\n\nIt doesn't matter if they should be allowed to, they are allowed to. No rules were broken so you using it as an example of corruption is wide of the mark.\n\nAs a chelsea fan i am ecstatic for this fallout in five years\n\nWhich teams aren't arab owned?\n\nFootball will be better off without Man City.\n\nLook what Rangers got done with and they were far less severe charges.\n\nDidn't rangers start a new club called ranger new co, and that's why they had to start out from the bottom\n\nYes and no. It‚Äôs the same club, they just had to rebuild themselves under the new ownership who bought the clubs‚Äô assets. New company name, but same club\n\nIt won't happen.\n\nCould be but of course won't be. I don't wish bad on the club as their fans have done nothing wrong but we all know they will never get a punishment like that.\n\nWhat kind of take is this?  If the club has been found to have cheated, they deserve to be punished‚Ä¶\n\nThat‚Äôs not what hes saying though\n\nWhat is he saying, then?  I think it's only right to prioritize the integrity of the game-- the fans will  have to deal with the consequences.\n\nThey will be punished,  it'll be a very large fine. Perhaps ¬£100 million plus 10 pt deduction. But they won't be kicked out.\n\nvehemently disagree, if anyone thinks the premier league would spend the money they have and the time its taken to drag this kicking and screaming into a courtroom just to let city off with a slap on the wrist is deluding themselves.\n\nThe league is out for blood, if was interested in anything less than it never would have fought so hard to get to this point. It it gets it way city is going to be hit extremely hard\n\nIt's not only the alleged cheating that has taken place-- City have refused to cooperate, signaling that they don't believe the PL has the right to investigate and discipline them.  \\*If\\* City are found to be guilty, the PL needs to set a precedent to dissuade any club from behaving as if they're above the integrity of the league.\n\nCould be but doubt it\n\nI would even give away my Fantasy performance for that.\n\nlet‚Äôs have it shall we\n\nShould be done yesterday\n\nThis won‚Äôt happen. Justice doesn‚Äôt exist.¬†\n\nNow we are talking, IF they are found guilty they must be made an example of and punished accordingly with no silly small fines and actual expulsion!\n\nSure they could üòÇ\n\nthe old SMU death sentence\n\nFor sure I would love it\n\nThis is about power and influence...and the city owner's know no limit in UAE as they have absolute power there.....they will continue to abuse the system if it doesn't fit their objectives using all means (legal challenges) available and money no object - just so long as they get their way. The punishment has to be relevant and proportionate but it also has to deter the same behaviours being repeated and I fear whatever punishment is dished out city's owners will continue to behave in a similar manner. It's what they are.\n\nThis would extreme! Oh my!\n\n\nMan City are favourites to win the league.\n\nGive me a hell yeah!\n\nYou know that note of that is happening, right?\nIt will be a huge fine and that‚Äôs it.\n\nThis won‚Äôt happen in a million years - total clickbait\n\nYeah. Right...\n\nBut they won't. They'll get a fine and maybe a 20 point deduction which means for 1 year they won't win the league. Isnt a chance the City Lawyers‚Ñ¢ are going to let them get away with anything more\n\nnothing will happen\n\nYe nothing will happen so... nothing to see here\n\nDon‚Äôt give us hope! Won‚Äôt happen\n\nHalland could go to Spain, would be ideal for everyone else üòÇ\n\nFingers crossed ü§û. I hope they get punished severely for being cheating c.u.n.t.s. it's the hope that kills ya.\n\nFingers crossed ü§û\n\nNot in a million fucking years. 6-point deduction at most, maybe a transfer ban and a ‚Äòdonation fine‚Äô from it‚Äôs owners.\n\nUnfortunately, just another case of the trash press having to write about something. Most likely the sports page people there had it forced upon them. Even with the tabloids, the sports writers usually know their shit.\n\nNote how ‚Äòthirsty‚Äô readers are for news/updates on a closed hearing. That creates a vacuum that needs to be filled with ‚Äúmaybe this could possibly happen‚Äù bullshit.\n\nSource: it can be revealed\n\nI don‚Äôt believe that it will happen thb. But let‚Äôs assume this will happen. What will happen to Citys titles? And would this also mean that the players are free agents? What is going to happen with the youth teams? And most importantly, what will happen with all the people who work for City? (Chefs, staff etc.)\n\nMay I just commend the commenters on here for their supreme intellects and deep knowledge. Well done everyone!\n\nToo good to be true\n\nThey might have some sanctions but chances are it'll be a slap on the wrist. \n\nA really harsh sentence will open up boxes that people want to keep closed. None of the others will want a precedence for if/when they are the next.\n\nI wish. But guess what? Nothing will happen to them, I would bet my life on it.\n\nI could be queen of England.\n\nCan‚Äôt wait for this FM25 save\n\nMan, people really need to stop spreading these nonsense clickbait headlines lop.\n\nThis wont and simply cant happen, period\n\nDoubt. $$$$ is all that matters and the EPL wants money not drama.\n\nAlso, it‚Äôs 2024! Since when do we hold people or corporations accountable anymore!? Such an old school thing /s\n\nWhile I‚Äôm not a ManCity fan, this would not be good for the sport. One of the top teams not playing will make others‚Äô victories shallow.\n\nThis won‚Äôt happen, they are just selling clicks\n\n‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nCould is doing some heavy lifting here\n\nI can‚Äôt wait to come back to threads like these when nothing happens and city win another league. The scenes\n\nUnfortunately we‚Äôve reached the point in football, particularly in the Premier League, where some clubs are now in the ‚ÄúToo big to fail‚Äù category. \n\nThat is, that if they were to face the consequences of their actions, they could well bring other clubs and the entire league down with them.\n\nFor good measure they should ban robot for the next 15 years.\n\n[Allow us all to share in MCI's moment of sorrow.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HORhtVkYaA)\n\nNever happening\n\nI'm ok with this, but you can't have a league winner for the season they get expelled, if it is under course. You have to apply this before the league starts or the other teams will be sallivating and the city players will be stuck in the club.\n\nYeah. Not happening\n\nDouble Arsenal league title parade incoming\n\nCity fans are going to save this and laugh at everyone when nothing happens probably\n\nThey‚Äôll be looking back in anger for sure\n\nDoubt\n\nand I could win the lottery .. ffs people we all knew this ***\"could\"*** happen\n\nThis isnt news!\n\nDo it\n\nBeen OOTL, what'd they do?\n\nSigh‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ *unzips*\n\nI‚Äôm praying\n\nBoring ass clickbait\n\nThey will probably move all their players to Girona somehow\n\nFear-mongering\n\nBut they won‚Äôt will they\n\nI didn't know telegraph hired comedians for editing.\n\n'Could' doing a lot of work there\n\nHey as long as Everton is punished too, I'm ok with that.\n\n/s\n\nThey would just start the super league\n\nGood, hope it happens\n\nFingers crossed\n\nIt needs to be more than 1 year or its a meaningless sacrifice any club would be willing to take. Trade a decade for 1 year of punishment? Absolutely.\n\nIn Spain we seen how a team has been paying the referees during years and years and nothing happened.\n\nEverything probed. Everything accepted. Barcelona was not even fined for that.\n\nThis is similar, City is too big to fall, like Barcelona, so they will say anything and let's continue with the circus.\n\nSo that‚Äôs where Man came from\n\nLets hope so.\n\nArsenal can finally win it\n\nIt'd be absolutely crazy if it happens but they'll get a light fine and a transfer ban and that'll be that.\n\nCan we all stop pretending like any football body will hold Saudi money accountable.\n\nIt won\\`t happen. I think the worst that will happen will be a 10/15 point deduction as a token punishment, A financial fine of say ¬£20 mill again as a token punishment and possibly a transfer ban for 2/3 windows.\n\nThey will bribe the Judges again and got no fine at all.\n\nNot going to happen.  At worst they'll get a huge points deduction that will drop them to the Championship.  No-one will leave and they'll treat the Championship season as a gap year; a bit of a laugh.  They'll come straight back up and carry on as normal as if nothing has happened.\n\nYeah, for sure...\n\n**Should**\n\nThis happened (kinda) with Juventus. Relegated to Serie C. Gigi Buffon and Del Piero stayed, brought Juventus back up to Serie A in two seasons. \n\nI doubt this would be the end of Manchester City (unless they‚Äôre dissolved as a penalty. And even then, they‚Äôd probably just reform as a different club, etc.). It would be very interesting to see this actually happen.\n\nZero chances this happening. They might get a small fine.\n\nHaaland to Wrexham - here we go!\n\nMassive fine that will be earmarked for lower league and grassroots. But 20 years later the money magically disappeared and all the FA board now own yatchs\n\nWill just end up being an expensive slap on the wrist. No point deduction and maybe a window ban but would assume it would be a January ban where City don‚Äôt really do much.\n\nLmao aint going to happen\n\nWe wish \n\nBut doubt it\n\nAll they have to do is hire Messi. Fifa and UEFA will bend over backwards to not only allow them to compete, but they will gift them the EPL, CL and another Ballon Dor for Messi. He doesn't even have to play. He just needs to sit on the bench the whole time.\n\nNow that it‚Äôs actually underway, can we stop the fantasy writing of punishments? If City have done this then the punishments we should be talking about are to the executives and people at the top of the club that made the decisions. \n\nWe‚Äôll have an answer relatively soon, this is all speculation\n\nNever\n\nIf you can‚Äôt beat em‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ some of you ppl are pathetic¬†\n\nThey could be sent to the moon -off this planet\n\nNot happening, too much money will be lost and that is all the FA, Premier League, UEFA and FIFA care about\n\nStop giving us hope.\n\nIt won‚Äôt happen. Look at what happened to serie a when Juve were expelled. The only way Man City are getting kicked out of the prem is if the super league comes back\n\nYIPPIE\n\nCity have too much money. Nothing will come of this.\n\nFunny thing tho¬†\nI tried to comment on it on one FB group. However I mentioned that it's not only the money talking, they can buy judges etc.¬†\nIt's also political because we know who's the owner and with new British government we can't be sure if they want to keep UAE elites happy and man city could be punished severely.¬†\nFacebook immediately deleted my comment, flagging it as the spam and fake news.¬†\n\nCity have too much money. Nothing will come of this.\n\n‚ÄúRichard Masters announced Manchester City‚Äôs 10 point deduction and ¬£40M fine from his new 100-meter yacht named ‚ÄúReprobate‚Äù.‚Äù"

    "body": "It was really evident that Roberto Martinez let Ronaldo call the shots all tournament. From starting every match after showing very poor form game after game, to in-game management decisions like taking off Bruno and Cancelo quite early when they were two players that were creating chances for Portugal while Ronaldo was just doing some light cardio. This has to be one of the first times a player or player‚Äôs legacy holds a whole team hostage like that. Huge opportunity missed by Portugal because they could have been much better if Ronaldo played a secondary role. What a shame. \n\nAny Portuguese people out there that would like to share what the overall opinion on all of this might be? ",

He should have accepted the super sub role.\n\nI remember seeing Ronaldo at an international tournament. I think it was the 2014 World Cup. \n\nThe camera was panning down the starting eleven before the start of the match. \n\nThe entirety of the Portuguese team was arm in arm and all were singing the Portuguese national anthem looking out into the distance, except Ronaldo.  \n\nHe wasn‚Äôt singing at all. He waited for the camera, looked into it, and winked. Showed me everything I needed to know. \n\nYesterday blasting the ball into the wall while his teammates sit in the box was the culmination.\n\nYep. Especially as a captain.\n\nCR7 could have been so lethal off the bench. Coming in at 60 minutes each game just to poach the goal but for some reason he plays 120 min instead and barely gets any touches in. It‚Äôs a shame indeed. I wonder how his teammates felt seeing him blast the fk in to the wall when any other player would have at least served it in to the box.\n\nAnd he even played the pointless game against Georgia instead of resting\n\nIt was his best chance to score, aint no way he will pass it up\n\nExactly.. Ronaldo looooooves to pad his stats against minnow teams, no way he was going to pass up that opportunity\n\nStill remember the game vs Luxembourg he was suspended for. Portugal had their biggest win ever and Ronaldo wasnt even there to partake in the stat-padding session, he must‚Äôve been really pissed lol\n\nHe was pissed too when Portugal beat Switzerland 6-1 at the 2022 WC and Ramos scored a hattrick. He got the coach fired for being subbed that tournament but Portugal looked better without him. I blame the Portuguese FA for giving him autonomy. Portugal are boring as fuck anyways\n\nBruh every team has their best game against Luxembourg\n\nHe can't rest - if he does, the world would see that the team is better without him\n\nHe was probably scared Ramos or Jota would come in and score a hat trick lol like when he got dropped in Qatar.\n\nYep, thought he was going to stat pad so wanted to play - I base this on my own inner feelings having never met the man.\n\nCommentary said Ronaldo had something like 68 missed free kicks for Portugal and is still on FK duty absolutely diabolical\n\nHe has literally never been good at free kicks. He scored a couple bangers early in his career and loved off it\n\nHe has scored 1 fk from 60 ish attempts at the euros\n\n[deleted]\n\nYeah and he‚Äôs generally just sucked ass at free kicks since the end of the Mourinho vs Pep years in Spain too\n\nIt most likely was major tournaments. My bad, I got it mixed up.\n\nThere have been 5 UK prime ministers since Ronaldo last scored a free kick at a major international tournament\n\nNot the flex it might seem at first glance. Didn't we get 3 in a month once?\n\nIt's never fun when facts get in the way of a stat.\n\nUnited tried doing that and Ronaldo went crying on Pierce Morgan‚Ä¶\n\nSee the last world cup if you really think he would've been 'lethal' off the bench.\n\nIf he put down his ego and think for the team he could do it but because he would come from the bench he would not shown passion\n\nHe's also stealing time and valuable international tournament experience from Portugals younger offensive players just to pad his own stats because he has an inferiority complex to messi, esp post WC win\n\nHe not only ruined this iteration of Portugal team, but hindered future generations by preventing them from getting proper play time in the euros...he's the worst\n\nIn the meantime, Deschamps substituted both Griezmann and Mbapp√© yesterday\n\n[removed]\n\nQatar was his last international tournament. He certainly hasn't been present in Germany (either).\n\nDeeply overrated player. A very good player, at his peak, but really not deserving of being talked about among the top 5, all time, and largely overhyped because of statistical achievements, much of which is heavily punching downhill. Commonly disappeared in big games,  and a terrible attitude toward team, versus self interest.\n\nVery much the *lesser* Ronaldo.\n\nI know there weren't any left footed freekick takers the team, but imagine having the arrogance to shoot from that angle. I'd have taken the captains armband off him there and then and told him to fuck off\n\nBernardo is absolutely a left footed player that could have taken the kick\n\nAll those priceless runs Leao made past the defenders to find no one around in the middle - Was disappointing.\n\nMe and my mate were amazed that not only did he shoot, but it was a bloody terrible shot too! \n\nIf I was a team mate, I would have been screaming at him for that one\n\nHe should've been used as an impact player rather than giving him full 90 or 120 minutes to play. People saw all the games of Portugal and were not convinced that Ronaldo will do any damage to their side if kept boxed and that's what happened. Portugal had great squad and depth but lacked motivation in later stages of game.\n\nHe wouldn't have been shit off the bench. Do you guys watch the damn game? He is finished.\n\nAt least he is 39 Harry Kane is doing the same with England right now smh\n\nHarry Kane tries so much harder to be involved then Ronaldo at this stage that it isn‚Äôt even remotely a comparable situation.\n\nEngland need him to play as a target man, but he seems to prefer to play in midfield just so he gets the ball a bit more. England don‚Äôt need him to try harder than Ronaldo, they just need him to be a proper number 9\n\nIt's not entirely different. For Ronaldo it's age, for Kane it's (seemingly) coming back from an injury too soon, which he's done before.\n\npiss off. ronaldo is a man child. he has had his time. its time for him to retire.¬†\n\nYou either retire a hero, or play long enough to see yourself turn into a villain. \n\nGotta respect people like Toni Kroos, who stop when they are still in top form, and let the next generation have the stage.\n\nI don‚Äôt disagree, but picking Kroos as an example after he just had one of the worst games of his latter career is funny to me.\n\nWhat funny to me is people are so quick to jump on him after one bad game and forgot how much his come back has helped Germany this tournament. Pretty much proves the point that his early retirement was the right choice. Imagine what would happen if he stayed as long as Ronaldo does.\n\nJudging a player by 1 bad game is crazy when he was one of the best performing players for Madrid. He was arguably their best midfielder this season and a crucial part to them winning the UCL.\n\nHe was also one of if not their worst player at the 2018 World Cup.\n\nWas he actually? All i remember is that godly fk against sweden\n\nRight. Because he‚Äôs the cause of Germany team‚Äôs problems. Germany got kicked out of WC 2022 was probably his fault too. Oh wait!\n\n[deleted]\n\nKroos was pathetic in his final match. He should have received two yellow cards and been sent off before the 60th minute.\n\nIts a shame really. I thought Portugal was a good contender for winning the cup. Despite Ronaldo and that joke of a coach. Pepe was in great form. Bruno and Vitinha pose so much threat and got subbed. Portugal has so much potential and they blew it trying to make a hasbeen goat greater than he was. Portugal played every match 10 vs 12 with Ronaldo being the best defender for the opposing team. Thats how I will remember Portugal this tournament.\n\nI always said that this Portugal team had huge chances of going all the way here, not just with the pedigree of their players, but also with so many of those players hitting peak form in the lead up to the tournament. All that quality was, in the end, effectively squandered. Now, while we can shit on Ronaldo all we want, the real villain here is Martinez. He was rigid in his decision making and always saw it fit to cater to Ronaldo's ego above the team's needs. Even if Ronaldo offered next to nothing, even if he looked absolutely knackered, Martinez was too much of a pussy to take the big man off out of fear of getting ridiculed by Ronaldo and his fans alike. It more or less seemed like a joke after a while, except it wasn't. For the future, Portugal needs a manager with some cojones and the spine to be decisive and make it clear to old Crissy boy that it's time to move on; Martinez just ain't that guy. As for the WC 2026, I'm not sure Ronaldo will even *be* there, but if he is, this bullshit of giving him every minute and allowing him to take every FK surely isn't going to work any better than it did now. Judging by his performances in this Euros, I'd be shocked if he even gets a seat on the plane in two years time.\n\nMartinez was hired to be THAT guy. The Portuguese FA make more money with Ronaldo playing than they do winning without him. So he plays every minute and one of the best Portugal teams in a generation flounders.\n\nThis is the most accurate comment. Today the Portuguese federation is a money making machine, and the profit of losing with Ronaldo in the pitch is way higher than winning the championship. That‚Äôs why he played.\n\nI know he‚Äôs just gone to Fenerbahce, but I would love to see Mourinho manage Portugal. He‚Äôs one of the only coaches around actually certain enough of himself to drop Ronaldo (still an underrated move by EtH at United imo) and I imagine the connection he‚Äôd have with his own national team would make the manager himself far more interesting than he‚Äôs been in a good while\n\nRonaldo will first have to solve his US legal issues before going to the WC\n\nI smell Erik. But also saw Piers Morgan at the side of my eyes üëÄ\n\nHe can't go to the WC 2026, he has outstanding warrants in the US.\n\n[deleted]\n\nPepe is an beast, still going strong!\n\nIt was a joy to watch him in this tournament, he played fantastic last night, at one stage he just about held his own in a straight race for the ball with Thuram, amazing stuff.\n\nHe ended up getting the tackle in at the end of that race and put it out for a corner. He's 15 years older than Thuram and had played almost 90mins already when Thuram had only just come on.\n\nYep, Thuram just about had him for pace but then Pepe's experience kicked in. He celebrated that tackle like he scored a goal too. It was a joy to watch really.\n\nüíØ. I haven't been Pepe's biggest fan over the years but he deserved better last night.\n\nWildest thing I heard was Pepe is 2 years older than Lamine Yamals dad. Which also means Ronaldo is the same age as Lamine Yamals dad\n\ni was actually fucking mad why the fuck would you start a 41 year old defender when all the france's forwards and fullbacks burst with pace but he really gave a solid performance\n\ncause the other options aren't great. Inacio and Antonio Silva don't have Pepe's experience and it's debatable if they're better players than him.\n\nPepe is a nasty c_nt.\n\nThe real kick in the teeth is even though the teams left (and some that were knocked out already) are strong on paper but have played like shite, save for Spain. Spain would have to be favourites now.\n\n\nSpecial mention to Cody Gakpo who's putting the team on his back.¬†\n\nGenerally I have that rivalry thing and never support Spain but this year, I'm all in for them because they are the only team (or almost) that are playing proper football.\n\nHave you noticed Carvajal and Cucurella? They're rolling on the ground every five minutes after feeling a light breeze\n\nFootball was never so bad in terms of theatre. \n\nThey all should be penalised. Funny enough only Le√£o and Neto took yellow cards.\n\nCarvajal or Cucurela are not better in theater than Bellingham or Dumfries.\n\nIf you are just a german complaining, be happy that  Kroos could have take at least 4 yellows and finished the game.\n\nThis is the harsh reality, but his fans can't accept it\n\nOnly his psycho crazy fans \n\nAny genuine fan would want to see him win unfortunately Ronaldo wants Ronaldo to win first \n\nIt‚Äôs stupid but his ego is costing the whole team\n\nAny standard decent forward would have done more for Portugal in this quarterfinal \n\nYou can legit see upfront he‚Äôs not the same any more \n\nSlower reaction times even more sloppy mistakes drops too deep constantly looking for the header instead of dropping back sporadically looking for a kick, numerous mistakes in build up plays and doesn‚Äôt track back\n\nEven Messi tracks back more than Ronaldo n Messi is far more involved in the play\n\nI‚Äôll always be a fan of cr7 he did incredible things but he‚Äôs fallen out of favor with god or whatever universe thing u believe him that used to give him luck\n\nSo many shots he took this tournament he would have made those clean pre-2021 \n\nIt‚Äôs a shame but it‚Äôs time he becomes the substitute \n\nRather get 20 minutes of Ronaldo that plays at level 8/9/10 outta 10 than get 120 minutes of 4 outta 10 Ronaldo (assuming he‚Äôs still good enough by that age)\n\n\n\nHonestly Portugal played great just the final piece of buildups was missing cause they have to compromise themselves with Ronaldo around\n\nHe should have retired when he went to Saudi, or at least retire from international football, what‚Äôs the point of statpadding at this point, it‚Äôs not only pathetic but also ruins his legacy\n\nFacts he should take a sub role but the ego that carried him here is now the bane of his existence\n\nThere were so many people prior to yesterday's game saying he had been Portugal's best player. Tons of upvoted comments saying similar. Felt like I was taking crazy pills.\n\nMost of those people were \"Ronaldo fans\" not actual football fans. They are fans of his looks and Ronaldo the celebrity , not his football skills..\n\nFootball fans saw a man who was a shadow of his former self\n\nThis tournament is the first time I've watched him play in awhile and damn does he look slow.¬†\n\nHe is simply no where near international football standard anymore. Honestly It is sad to see him aimlessly run around and look so out of depth now. Should have called it quits after Qatar but even that was one tournament too many.\n\nHis fans are smooth brains\n\nIt's completely Roberto Martinez fault. People should understand that. That man could not do anything with Belgium golden generation. If he stays, no matter Ronaldo retires or not, Portugal won't win any trophy.\n\nTotally agree! How he didn't win anything with that team of players is criminal.\n\nIt‚Äôs so hard to win major tournaments. Better teams than that Belgian team lose tournaments all the time.\n\nEveryone thinks their own countries \"golden generations\" should win tournaments, just look at England, but as you say there's often better teams out there who win the tournaments.\n\nYup, people talked about England's old team in the early 00s... some excellent players, and they sound baffled that England didn't win with them. \n\nThe first memory I have of that team was their loss to Brazil at the World Cup, and that was a team that had Carlos, Cafu, Ronaldo, Rivaldo, and Ronaldinho in it... a team that left Kaka on the bench because it was that good. \n\nSoon after that, you're looking at insane German and Spanish sides... more currently, France has the most ridiculous pool of talent. Belgium simply faced that same issue, better teams.\n\nHe lost to eventual winners in both 2018 and 2021. Not sure how much better they could have done. There are no guarantees in international football. And they had tough draws each time, unlike England.\n\nItaly had far weaker team on paper, but played probably the best football in 2021 (before Spinazzola‚Äôs injury anyway). That‚Äôs what a good coach does: lift the team and make them punch above the weight.\n\nMartinez does the opposite.\n\nIt‚Äôs difficult to win stuff with your striker missing sitter after sitter‚Ä¶.no justification for martinez though\n\n[deleted]\n\nTrue. Martinez is average, not a great coach and not a gambler.\n\nThe greatest coaches know when to take calculated risks.\n\nHe never does.and that's why he ultimately fails.\n\nThe Belgian golden generation famously hated one another behind the scenes.\n\nAlthough Martinez has a large part of the blame for Portugal‚Äôs gamesmanship, the Ronaldo part isn‚Äôt his direct fault. You can‚Äôt sit Ronaldo out, he is irreplaceable for the Portuguese Football Federation, I firmly believe that is part of the contract for the NT coach, it‚Äôs like an unwritten law. It‚Äôs sad and Portuguese people aren‚Äôt a happy about it. Things need changing from the coach to the Football Federation. The whole structure is broken and filled with corruption. We must wait like 20 years until things change. I‚Äôm gutted!\n\nMartinez is actually smart. He knows that by playing washed up Ronaldo he‚Äôll win his support and secure his job regardless of results. Portuguese fans are getting screwed by having this over the hill egomaniac having a sniff on the team. This team could be champions but never until they outlaw Ronaldo from the team. He‚Äôs poison everywhere he goes including Portugal.\n\nI am in my (very) late thirties now and as long as I can think Belgium was called a secret favorite every single tournament. They reached one final and that was in 1980. \n\nSomehow, every generation is suddenly a golden generation when certain players playing their last big tournament. So, being Belgiums coach is a fight you cant win.\n\nI‚Äôve seen this floated around and not disputing you but just want to point things out.\n\n1. RM is overrated af as a manager. No idea why he gets these jobs when he is really piss poor. So not disagreeing with you.\n\n2. However good those Belgium sides were under him, the fundamental issue was Belgium never had top class fullbacks which limits them on playing 4 atb. So belgium went with 3/5 atb but they don‚Äôt have great wingbacks too. With Portugal RM went with 4 atb so it‚Äôs not like he loved a 3 men defence, but rather clearly it is a deficiency of the belgian national pool.\n\nI think that belgium squad just constantly get hyped up as the ‚Äúgolden generation‚Äù but people not seeing the fundamental flaw with them. That being said, RM being also overrated means i was never surprised at how they fared.\n\nIn 2016, before we miraculously  won the tournament, I was already \"anti\" Ronaldo for the simple reason that he were not playing as a team but we were playing for him to solve the games.\n\n\nIn these 8 years we had many games where he didn't play and we played much more as a team and found other options than 20 crosses for Ronaldo to score. Even with Martinez we had several games like that.\n\nThis Euro, it seems he put himself completely ahead of then nation. It's ridiculous and shows how weak Martinez is.\n\nWhen we played Georgia, Martinez said 24h in advance that Ronaldo would play. It means that he was already told by Ronaldo \"I want to play\".\n\nA normal coach (with character) and a normal player (wanting the best for his team) would do differently... use fresh Ronaldo against tired defenses in last 20minutes. \n\nNo, he had to play from start, and he could never be replaced because he needs another record and needs to be one of the penalty takers. Fuck off Ronaldo!\n\nWe were strong. Playing with 10 we were superior to France... imagine playing with 11 and a proper coach! GG Portugal\n\nMan i just made a comment‚Ä¶ and in other words I have said the same, i agree with you totally! \n\nIt also seems the players dont even try to look to pass to Ronaldo unless its the only option‚Ä¶ probably because he is not really making runs to show for the ball. \n\nBut as an outsider, it is clear to see 10 portugal players running around‚Ä¶ and then one other guy in a portugal kit, playing for himself‚Ä¶ \n\nIts such a shame for your country and I would demand Martinez out because of this. Fuck Ronaldo and his records, many people had you guys as favourites:.. But im afraid your odds have been shot by the fact you have played the majority of your minutes with a player less than every other team ‚òπÔ∏è\n\nThis was also the case when he was in Manchester United, he simply doesn't cut it anymore at the top level.\n\nHe has to have a narcissistic personality disorder or something to derail the whole team like this. It's painful to watch as a non Portuguese.\n\nEdit: Rest of the team played great tho and I'm convinced that if they didn't have psycho Ronaldo crying every time he misses shot or free kick, which is many times every game, and had just a decent striker instead Portugal would've advanced. Can't believe he cried after having his penalty saved when the team huddled around to talk tactics. it takes a special kind of narcissist to make it all about you and your missed penalty.\n\nCried while the game was tied and not over. People tried to call it passion. Nah, maybe if he cried after they lost. With 15 minutes left to play in a tie game? Pure selfishness.\n\n&gt;In 2016, before we miraculously won the tournament, I was already \"anti\" Ronaldo for the simple reason that he were not playing as a team but we were playing for him to solve the games.\n\nExactly! I've been saying the same! For a long time Portugal have been a better team when he's not playing because when he's on the pitch he has to be the focus of everything, which makes it easier to play against.\n\nThis is exactly why eric ten haag left him on the bench he realised that you literally need to adapt the entire team to play around the ageing ronaldo.\n\nYea exactly and it made sense to do that 6+ years ago when he was in his prime but to have to fit everybody around an ageing player who is a shadow of what he used to be is ridiculous.\n\n[deleted]\n\nYou could see he was done when Saliba easily held him off to then easily pass the ball out.\n\nNo disrespect to Saliba he's amazing but you would think Ronaldo would have done more\n\nI would be absolutely fuming if i was the Portuguese FA‚Ä¶ and RM would be out of the door before the team arrived back in Portugal. \n\nI‚Äôm not Portuguese, I‚Äôm not a Ronaldo fan‚Ä¶ I respect his career and what he achieved, his hard work has paid off, but I despise the guy. \n\n58 free kicks is it now at major tournaments‚Ä¶ 1 scored (he has hit some screamers in his career, but selfish prick should have passed the baton by now) \n\n39 years old, still dancing around the ball like a fairy, with no effect, not tricking the defence, then just passing the ball anyway‚Ä¶ it looks embarassing‚Ä¶ \n\nPepe‚Ä¶ 41 years old, still charging around the field like a Rhino, still making passes and game saving challenges, he is the true hero and not CRbastard7. \n\nHe goes down like a sack of potatoes last night when Theo Hernandez‚Äôs head brushes up against his own‚Ä¶ how many free kicks did he give away? For pushes, offsides‚Ä¶ the pushes are a joke, from corners especially, he did the same twice against Oblak.. and no sportsmanship about him to apologise, he just walks off with a smirk grin on his face as if the ref is drunk and has no clue. \n\n‚ÄòLight cardio‚Äô someone wrote‚Ä¶ spot on‚Ä¶ the geezer doesnt run‚Ä¶ he is not available for passes, he has actually hardly any presence on the football pitch. \n\nConceicao made a great run and squared him the ball and he was obviously too slow to react and his shot was skied high and wide. \n\nThe guy is a has been‚Ä¶ okay 30+ goals in Saudi sounds impressive, but when we dont watch that week in week out, we cant really compare that to other leagues‚Ä¶ i mean he is playing sometimes in front of crowds as little as a few hundred right? It is clear to see he cannot keep up with this level any longer‚Ä¶ which is a shame, but maybe because he is all about himself and not a team player‚Ä¶ if he dropped back a bit, made himself available, passed the ball and did the simple things, made the runs and perhaps ping a shot once in a while, he may be more effective‚Ä¶ again, look at Pepe‚Ä¶ older still but doesnt look out of place in that Portugal side‚Ä¶ \n\nRonaldo is a has been and he should have been left on the bench or brought on at the ends of games to maybe try and make a difference or for the penalties‚Ä¶ \n\nBut to take off, Cancelo, Bruno, Vitinha, Leao‚Ä¶ younger fitter players who could make a difference‚Ä¶ leaving on a guy which pracitcally meant Portugal were playing most of the game with 10 players, just so the guy could take a penalty in a shootout they ended up losing anyway‚Ä¶ yet celebrating as if he is still 21 and in his prime bigging himself up‚Ä¶ im sorry, but what an absolute wanker.\n\nCRbastard7 has made my day üòÇüòÇ\n\nI would call him CRap7! But yes, CRy7 is a massive baby. Get rid!\n\nCRy7 is excellent\n\nI work and are friends with a few Portuguese and they all think he shouldn‚Äôt be a starter and if he is the en should be getting subbed in the 60 min mark. They think he is running the team and Martinez is weak to him\n\nThe free kick situation was the biggest joke. I can't remember the last time I saw him convert one.\n\nOut of 58 i believe at major tournaments‚Ä¶ he has scored 1. \n\nIt is an absolute embarassment that this 39 year old man steals the ball the grab the lime light in free kick situations when his ‚Äòrecord‚Äô is almost non existent from them‚Ä¶ \n\nHe is proper cringey if you ask me‚Ä¶ \n\nPepe tho.. 41 years old‚Ä¶ true soldier, doesnt look out of place one bit‚Ä¶ hasnt got the pace he once had but he is still there making crunching tackles and has a proper presence in his team.\n\nOne goal from 60 FK attempts at major tournaments.\n\nTotally agreed. But the problem is, their manager isn‚Äôt strong enough to make the decision to put Ronaldo on the bench. Why? Because Ronaldo then will act like a crybaby, just like he did with Man United. So instead of making a tough decision, he let‚Äôs Ronaldo deicide if he‚Äôs playing or not.\n\nPortugal will play better football when Ronaldo retires, but with Martinez as manager they will never win a major trophy.\n\nMartinez is spineless. I don't think Ronaldo should even have been in the squad, but when it became apparent just how past it he was he should not have started let alone stayed on the pitch. \n\nAny manager with a backbone would have benched him. He was even getting chances and fluffing them.\n\nCRonaldo is a narcissistic bastard. He thought he could do the same shit at United and he‚Äôs doing it in the tinpot Saudi League. He‚Äôs ruining his legacy while Messi is retiring with grace like a pro. Total mental weakness.\n\nMessi is a legend. Please don‚Äôt mention him in the same sentence as Ronaldo\n\nAny football fans with few brain cells knew this is how it was going to go down as soon as they appointed Roberto Martinez. Portugal have one of the best, if not the best squads at Euro. Ramos and Jota were heavily underutilized. Ronnie is holding this team back. It's the time.¬†\n\nIt‚Äôs genuinely unforgivable he had Ramos and Jota sitting on the bench most of the tournaments when they went three games without scoring. \nThe mismanagement that shows from Martinez is astounding.\n\nThe thing is, I still think Ronaldo could have something to offer this Portugal team, but starting him in every game and allowing him to play the full 90 (or 120) minutes only emphasizes how Mother Time has caught up to him. Say that the game is stalling at 0-0 and Portugal need an injection up front. If Ronaldo were to come into a game at a time like that, with fresh legs, I think he could do well. He'd have more energy and more capacity to do what he can do. Playing him like Martinez has recently only exposed Ronaldo for the geriatric old geezer he is, which is unfair since he still has at least *something* to offer.\n\nHe'd just storm off\n\nJota and Ramos deserved to play a lot more. At least should have got a chance against Georgia full 90 mins.\n\nThe mashup with christiano ronaldo and martinez is pure shite. I feel sorry for bruno fernandes, and I'm a Liverpoolfan, for pepe and vitinha. They could win the whole cup if they had a coach with balls, so cr would be more of a sub instead. Cr was a great player but today he's only a shadow of his padt, let him go ffs.\n\nIf Jota had played centre forward last night, Portugal would be in the semis.\n\nI never was a Ronaldo fan, but this tournament really exposed his true colors to a lot of non-football fans. He‚Äôs a selfish player.\n\nYup, Martinez is a pussy and he sucks as a coach.  He should do what‚Äôs right for the team.  Ronaldo will cry every game regardless of whether he plays or not.  Just be the manager and actually make meaningful decisions.\n\nSilva needs to be taking the free kicks\n\nPortuguese here.\n\nThe answer is money and ego. His ego makes him delusional about his current situation and money is the reason why the FPF #1 priority is to make sure he keeps playing as long as he wants to milk the cash cow that he still is. \n\nThat's why they appointed a nobody like Martinez as coach because they know he'll agree with everything, since gets no interest in the club market.\n\nUnfortunately, yes. Ronaldo should have been replaced during France-Portugal. He added nothing to Portugal's gameplay yesterday. He's a legend but it's time for him to retire honestly.\n\nEvery patriotic Portugese should burn Ronaldo's Tshirts today.\n\nHe owns the media in Portugal and he owns the National Team because of sponsor money.\n\nIt's sad.\n\nBro is 99% marketing since 2018.\n\nYeah what the fuck was that? Taking the best players off (Bruno) and Ronaldo who were poor, slow stays on while they have better options on the bench, Jota and G. Ramos.\n\nBruno wasn‚Äôt our best player yesterday.\n\nOr in any game at the Euros.\n\nPepe Mendes Le√£o Vitinha Concei√ß√£o all better\n\nsable label innate plough quiet deliver waiting kiss bright rich\n\n *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev/home)*\n\nJota was better too whenever he came on, he or Ramos should‚Äôve been starting ahead of Ronaldo\n\nAbsolutely correct. Portuguese here and I agree 100%. Portugal has one of the best squads in its history. Full of good players in their prime and many talented young players.\n\nI can‚Äôt stand this cult about this egoistic guy. It‚Äôs time to leave.\n\nThe blame lies somewhere between Martinez and the Portuguese FA. I‚Äôd like to say Martinez should‚Äôve made it clear to Ronaldo he would be a bit part player. But maybe he was under pressure to play Ronaldo from their FA.\n\nPortugal were essentially playing with 10 men most of this tournament. Gotta feel sorry for the other players in their peak years who have had to sacrifice their tournament to accommodate Ronaldo.\n\nWhen he started crying Midgame the other match and the other players had to motivate him I thought:‚Äú yeah it must be shit seeing your legend fall apart like this on the pitch, very very demotivating for the rest of the team.‚Äú\n\nSameish goes for Kroos yesterday, should have subbed him very early, dude was loosing it at the start, we would have been lucky him getting yellow early, could have settle his heat faster‚Ä¶\n\nIf Ronaldo was an NBA player he'd be making the team draft his son and hiring his podcast buddy with no coaching experience to be head coach.\n\nPortuguese here! You are absolutely right! Ronaldo should have started in the bench. Unfortunately, the coach does not have what it takes. And he'll be around for two more years..\n\nSaudi league era Ronaldo is literally Homelander\n\nHe is Homelander since Man Utd 2nd stint.\n\n*always been Homelander. \n\nWhile Messi is Hughie. Righteous, compassionate and unselfish.\n\nI'm Portuguese and I've held that opinion since the first game in the latest World Cup.\n\nThis is a cultural thing. People are used to sacrifice the greater good in the name of subservience. It doesn't matter if you're a hindrance, as long as you've got the status.\n\nRonaldos 40-50 goals in Saudi or whatever it was, just got totally irrelevant to his all time record after his performance at the Euros. Last year he was saying that Saudi league is better than French league, now the top scorer of Saudi league couldn‚Äôt even score one freaking goal. To be fair, it‚Äôs not all about goals either but then again his performance during the games were utterly despicable. The GOAT disussion just got easier and easier to argue for Messi in the last 5 years, although it was never a real discussion IMO.\n\n100% Ramos would‚Äôve been better than Ronaldo and Jota is better than Felix. French CBs had such an easy night. Portugal deserve to go out for those choices but they were better than France overall. \n\nRonaldo = üê™ Pepe = üêê\n\nAs a Liverpool fan we are really happy to see that Jota won't be coming back injured but sad that he didn't get a chance to show what he can do on the big stage.  When we want goals we put Jota on, the guy can conjure a goal out of nothing.  Ronaldo took a beautiful penalty but I don't remember him contributing anything else during the game.  I agree with the general consensus that Martinez is a truly awful manager, he was woeful in the premiere league and proved with Belgium that he was no better with a team of top talent to manage.\n\nJota went in against slovenia, in vitinha's place which isn't even where he's confortable playing and made that solo run that turned into a penalty from nowhere. You would assume he and Ramos were injured the way Martinez had to hold onto Ronaldo for 120 minutes last night.\n\ndidn't he do the same with Juventus and Man United? Not the first time. He's always been a diva, but back then his abilities still justified his actions.\n\nTo a certain degree yes, but since Juve, a few more years passed and he played in a farmers league the past season. Add low quality competition to advanced age, it is obvious he lost a step or two\n\nHis 2nd season at united were shit. I'm a united fan and I'm really pissed on how poor his finishing was. He got many chances ngl especially in Europa league yet he can't seem to put those behind the net. Off the ball, he offered nothing and yet, his 'fans' blamed ETH for his downfall lmao. \n\nIt's fascinating to see those fans criticized ETH when cr7 gets benched. Like bro, if a striker couldn't score a goal despite given many matches in a row and gotten many chances on goal, you can't get mad for being benched. \n\nHe's a legend through and through and that's a fact but his time is up on high level matches.\n\nAs a Portuguese, I can confirm that is the sentiment being echoed by a lot of people. As you might imagine, questioning Ronaldo‚Äôs role is almost akin to sacrilege for a lot of people, even in face of overwhelming evidence. It is a real shame, this year portugal had probably the best overall team we‚Äôve had in a long time, literally every single player is world class.\n\nSame thing happened in the World Cup too and to some extent in the last Euros as well (but the goals covered up his stinkers).\n\nThis Portugal team would have killed it, if the manager had some cojones. He was more interested in gratifying Ronaldo than winning the tournament.\n\nIMO, this could have been an ideal starting front line  \nLeao      Jota       Neto\n\nIt's amusing that the only time Portugal have won anything in the Ronaldo era is when he had to go off injured.\n\nHe's been a great player, I find the modern era of being a fan of a player weird, support teams not players. But he's undoubtedly been one of the best, however he's not been elite since he re-joined United, he just hasn't been able to realise it himself yet. I honestly think the tears the other day was him realising that he is no longer there any more.\n\nIt must be frustrating being that good all your life and suddenly your body can't do it any more. But he has ruined a United side that was transforming itself into a youthful press. He's taken a bunch of people to Saudi to sportswash all their grim away. Now he's ruined Portugals chances of a tournament by clearly refusing to be anything other than the main man.\n\nAlso, Roberto Martinez must give one hell of an interview, I've no idea how he has failed upwards so much in his managerial career.\n\nyou do stupid things, you pay the price RM\n\nI have never been able to look at Martinez in the same way since seeing that video of him dancing at a Jason Derulo concert.\n\nhttps://youtube.com/shorts/e3xz04neYvw?si=Dk7EUAleNE6lsmAW\n\nI'm starting to think the Saudis chucked a load of wonga at the Portuguese FA to get them to play Ronaldo constantly to promote their league.\n\nI personally don't know any Portuguese adult (I'm portuguese) that wants Ronaldo in the team. Only jornalits and children still look at him as some kind of hero. It's simply pathetic.\n\nWhat was a failed Wigan and Everton manager going to do to put one of the biggest egos on the history of sport in his place?\n\nPortuguese here. We think exactly like that\n\nI don't get it either. To me, there's way more dignity in Ronaldo playing well as a sub than whatever the hell Ronaldo and Martinez were doing in this Euro.\n\nNarcissistic tendencies gonna narc I guess\n\nHe needs to retire. Portugal have some real talent upfront. Ronaldo is only for himself.\n\nI'm portuguese and I agree 100% with you.\n\nPenaldo is truly finished\n\nAnd you‚Äôre still a nobody hating.\n\nWhere is Eder when they need him lmao\n\nMain character syndrome when you‚Äôre sat in the middle of the team huddle getting two leg massages.\n\nI think Portugal will be a better team without him.\n\nI think the most telling fact that CR7 was in charge of that Portugal team, was the fact he took every ‚Äòwithin range‚Äô free kick. They were all abysmal attempts, as per usual, yet he was allowed to continue to boot them into the wall or wildly over the bar. Even when the better option was to have someone get a good ball into the box, nope, Ronaldo needed his shot on goal. I got so genuinely frustrated with watching Portugal that I was glad they lost. What really annoyed me at the end though was when the camera was on him after full time and he looked up to screens in the stadium and smiled with that indignant ‚Äòwhy they showing me‚Äô look. But the ENTIRE game, he was looking at the cameras to see if he was being shown. Truly pathetic and Portugal, despite his mammoth efforts for the national team, will and should thrive now without him\n\nI'm pretty excited to see how we do next Euro when we have a squad without him. I feel like the team has revolved around him for a long time, but he hasn't done much for it.\n\nMy wife is Portugese and we are visiting her family right now. The general consensus in Portugal seems to be that he basically ruined the tournament for them. It's sad to see him ruining his legacy with his own selfishness.\n\nRonaldo is the fat kid that has a ball that sucks at football, wants to play as a striker but cant run cant shoot, takes every freekicks every penalty. Because if he doesn't he'll just go home with the ball.\nExcept it's the Euro so he doesn't even bring a ball\n\n\nEven more shameful when next to him there is Pepe, older than him still professionnal and good at his job .\n\nPortugal could've gone far in this tournament if they had left Ronaldo in Saudi Arabia.\n\nRonaldo is a great player, but it's time to stop with the Portugal National Team. He is already borderline making a fool of himself.\n\nRonaldo crying with 15 mins to go in that game against Slovenia speaks volumes about his mentality, and is frankly embarrassing from someone who is captaining their team and supposed to bring them up, but instead he is just overcome by emotion because he didn't take his goal scoring chance in the penalty.\nWhile I'm sure some of his tears were about the fact that his team might go out, I think the real reason and why he really cried was because his ego couldn't handle his own personal fall from grace, the idea of exiting what is most likely his last international tournament without scoring any goals, that was the real tragedy he was actually upset about. It's all theoretical, but the fact that his emotions weren't nearly at the same level when they did actually crash out of the tournament kind of confirms it for me.\n\nI love posts like this. They really highlight which football fans watch the ball, and who watch the game.\n\nIn every single game this tournament Ronaldo has been making runs throughout the game. In behind, diagonal, straight etc. I encourage anyone to go back and watch any of the games to see this. The other players don't want to pass the ball to him because it's easier to pass it sideways and then play a bad cross to absolutely no one.\n\nNext, Ronaldo is an aerial presence, yet not 1 cross last night went anywhere near him. It has been the same story all tournament, the Portuguese cannot cross a ball. Leao was very good, but his crossing was poor. Also, why is no one else in the box? Just Ronaldo? Even the cut backs and low crosses. First half yesterday he was wide open in the box as he stopped his run to separate from the defender. Nuno Mendes crosses it, in the air, to absolutely no one. I feel like the only sane person in the asylum right now. It was so blatantly awful and no one mentions it. A literal 8 yard ground pass would've given Ronaldo a shooting opportunity, but no, gotta fuck it somehow.\n\nNext up, the failures. Bruno Fernandes and Bernardo Silva. These guys must love having Ronaldo in the team, because they can get away with being really poor. Bruno Fernandes was so so poor in 4/5 games, the only reason he wasn't bad in the 5th was because he didnt play. Vitinha was very good in all the games he played, but he was alongside a useless bastard who can't pass forwards apparently. Don't even get me started on the shocking corner taking. Bernardo silva looked ok in spurts, but again, his reluctance to cross the ball, and the quality when he did was really shocking. He also missed a couple of good chances in the box.\n\nThe standard he's set for himself is the biggest issue in my opinion, he had 1 good chance in that game and even that...it was fizzed in, behind him. It's hardly gilt-edged. Any other player in world football playing that game would not be blamed. It would be as simple as the team not getting the ball into the striker.\n\nOverall I think that the dislike for Ronaldo makes pinning the whole thing on him very easy for people. It's the lowest hanging fruit, which I've come to expect from people these days. You can't even formulate your own opinion, just churn out what everyone thinks just to fit in.\n\nI wanted to post this because the slander is remarkable, and insanely unfair on the man. You are absolutely allowed to criticise, but just stop and think, am I criticising because of how he's performing? Because of who he is? Or because my bias has made me blame him for literally everything that's happened to them in this tournament. There were other players that were far worse than him.\n\nPortugal were not good enough to stay in, Martinez is a shocking manager who ruined the best Belgium squad of all time, but when it's Portugal, blame Ronaldo right?\n\nThis man, anyone who have watched the game fucking knows that the team was terrible, not even a goal. Somehow Ronaldo faults? Doesn‚Äôt make any sense. People just want to find faults in him. At least watch the games ‚Ä¶.\n\nAbsolute garbage take.\n\nPepe has been the MOTM in every single game imo.\n\nRonaldo has not received any deliveries. The commentators/pundits all said this. It was extremely clear to see.\n\nSet pieces had no planning/strategy behind it. \n\nThe issue is the management and strategies (or lack there of). \n\nThe good: they were very dominant in possession and extremely good off of the ball.\n\nHis performance was actually way better than his 2022 WC, but he still missed a great opportunity against France which might be a game winner. I guess he should consider retiring from national team ‚Äòcause he has been a starter for long and he probably won‚Äôt make it to 2026 so Portugal should play with a new starter striker.\n\nHe wants 250 caps\n\nThis is why Martinez was appointed\n\nHis last cameo for Manchester United had a very similar vibe. The team were better when he didn‚Äôt play, despite him scoring goals.\nA great player who can‚Äôt fathom that he is past his peak‚Ä¶he‚Äôs quite far down the other side of the mountain now.\n\nHis last half-season at United was the worst in his career, he looked way below PL standards. He went to the WC and completely stunk. Then he went to the Saudi League and deluded some people into thinking he was back to his best playing in a stacked team against third division opposition. Then back in a real tournament he stunk again.\n\nWell he can‚Äôt go to the next World Cup as it‚Äôs in America anyway, because he‚Äôs a r*pist\n\nSaid the same thing yesterday\n\nIt is the coach's fault at this point. He is too afraid to make the changes. Not bringing Jota on is an absolutely shameful coaching/substitution.\n\nWas awful the whole tournament. Like plain awful.\n\nI love him damn he's been terrible for Portugal these Euros.\n\nDude is -50% speed.\n\nFinally i see an post like this abroad, in Portugal this feeling is very much alive, Ronaldo shouldn't be playing that much time, he did next to 0, portugal played most of the matches 10 vs 11 and still did great\n\nTo not bring on someone as lethal as Jota was completely insane to me. He is the exact player that will get out that goal late in the game.\n\nWhat are you on about? Didn't you see that he scored 50+ goals in saudi? Put some respect on his name./s\n\nagreed he was a non factor and should have come off bench or been subbed off instead. \n\nit was also crazy how spanish commentators --while portugal had possession-- would narrate what Ronaldo was doing off the ball like all the time.\n\nWhenever people wanna start apologizing to the United fans that said he was the problem‚Ä¶we‚Äôre here. \n\nThe man is without question one of the best players to ever play the game. But he‚Äôs a complete wank stain narcissist.\n\nRonaldo has nothing left in the tank at this level‚Ä¶ And yes I‚Äôm a huge Ronaldo fan as I think he is one of the best player to ever play the game, and by FAR the best Portuguese player of all time. All he had left to give this team was his experience in the room and coming off the bench for the final 20 mins playing behind a real striker (that we seem not to really have) if we were down by a goal. Instead he played every minute of every game on legs that don‚Äôt have any juice left. Bad decision by player/management/coach‚Ä¶. All are to blame¬†"

    "all_comment_text": "Honestly I do think people care more about the politics in their country than Mbappe playing in the NT or not.\n\nThis might be off topic, but I actually believe that the portuguese people care more about if Ronaldo plays in the NT than politics.\n\nSame reason why Brazilian military cared more about Pele staying in Brazil than their domestic politics lol\n\nThat's kind of what happens when people live in corruption-ridden countries for decades; after a while, you'll start growing numb to it and look for distractions because you don't feel like you can do anything to change the system.\n\nThe reason might be they don‚Äôt have as many fascist loons in Portuguese politics compared to France and America, surely?\n\nOh we do, he just isnt as popular...yet\n\nSorry to hear.\n\nYou couldn‚Äôt be more wrong. Football in France isn‚Äôt as big as it is in other European countries such as Germany, Italy, Portugal, Spain. \n\nAlso, and I can‚Äôt speak for other countries, politic IS important to French citizens. An example ? Look at strikes, riots etc every times certain types of laws are about to get passed\n\nThat's what he's saying bud\n\nOhhh my bad I read ¬´¬†I *don‚Äôt* think¬†¬ª instead of do,\n\nNo no no - you wouldn‚Äôt be more wrong if you were feeding peanut butter and jelly to a tulip.  The French CARE about their politics more than football.\n\nThat‚Äôs‚Ä¶what I‚Äôm saying mate\n\nIt was sarcasm.  You said the person above you was wrong and then made the same point that they did.  So I did the same thing (although it‚Äôs not as fun when you have to explain it).\n\nThat‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying\n\nThat‚Äôs what everyone‚Äôs saying (which was my point)\n\nMon mauvais les amis &lt;3\n\nne laisse pas cela se reproduire &lt;3\n\nFootball isn‚Äôt big in France? who told you that? maybe we are not living for football like in Brazil but football in France is as big as you mentioned those European countries.\n\nFootball is by far the number one sport in France however it is not anywhere near what it represents in surrounding countries. When players get asked about the level of pressure they have been living in (press, fans, etc. ) in the leagues they have played in like in England, Italy, Spain, Germany, France it's pretty clear which contexts are \"quieter\" than others.\n\nAnd at the international level, seen how many fans are used to travel to watch their national team play live, from England, Scotland, Ireland, the Netherlands, Spain, Denmark, but also these days with Slovenia, Slovakia, Romania? There's just no comparison in terms of the level of impact that football has, pro-rated to the countries' total populations.\n\nExactly this\n\nlol it is soooo far away from what it is in other countries. I‚Äôm French and Italian, maybe you just don‚Äôt know how big it is a cultural thing over there and in other countries. If you speak French, have a look at l‚ÄôAfter foot on RMC radio / podcast, they have pundits who follow the big four football nations (plus Netherlands and Portugal), you may hear how huge it is in these nations compared to France\n\nIt must be hard to play for a country when half the people dont want you there.\n\nMore like a third, actually.\n\nNot much of a consolation, but still.\n\nMore like a quarter, considering abstention\n\n40% voted for Le Pen two years ago\n\nWas it a 100% turnout?\n\n13 288 686 people voted for her in 2022, which is a fifth of the population, and a quarter of the adult population.\n\nThe far-right getting loads of vote in France isn't something new. French cheering their multiracial teams when they win and hating anyone who isn't white is something that never made sense to me.\n\nMeh, that is accurate about RN as much as telling that the left wants to spoil him of all his money.   \nProbably there are some, but that's not the majority of the people voting for those parties.   \nBtw, RN is getting a lot of votes from VERY poor people, who can't stand anymore to live in blocks where delinquency runs wild (that is true for most of the EU right parties as well).\n\n[https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/who-is-voting-far-right-french-election-nears-2024-06-24/](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/who-is-voting-far-right-french-election-nears-2024-06-24/)\n\nSorry I don‚Äôt follow French politics, but is it like some party is against football or something?\n\nAgainst people with a year-round tan.\n\nLet‚Äôs say it‚Äôs against most people that play footy all in French National team\n\nThey'd likely request french heritage players in the team. \n\nLe Pen isnt as bad as nazism just to be clear but her part are of a similar brush. \n\nI could imagine if they gained a stronghold, minimum may be french born but perhaps parents born (its all speculation in some regards but they have a deep racist heritage)\n\nDon‚Äôt care what side they are supporting, NEVER vote by direction of celebrities, athletes or business owners. Do your own research and vote for parties that align with your needs.\n\nI can't watch this video because it's on X, and I know that Mbappe is clearly anti-fascist, but I don't think there is any harm in celebrities who say \"go and vote\".\n\nUltimately, broadly speaking, we see voter suppression coming from the right wing because it benefits them the most. If young(er), (more) working class people voted, we would see less conservatives in power. The power is in the hands of the small(er) group of highly motivated, older, richer people.\n\nSo it's fairly clever (and justified) for celebrities to say \"I don't care who you vote for, just vote\", because they know that this will be bad for the right wing.\n\n&gt;If young(er), (more) working class people voted, we would see less conservatives in power.\n\n\nI don't know where you come from, but nowadays in many countries, working class people is voting right and far right, why? Because the left is failing to adress the problems they face in their everyday lives. If you are a working class citizen who has problems with crime in his neighborhood, mostly caused by recent immigrants and lost his job because another immigrants are willing to do it for less money, and then your leftist politician talks to you about climate change and minority rights, you will vote the anti immigration guy. I know this problem is much more complicated than that, but this is how it is. Besides, working class people tend to be more conservative in many countries.\n\n&gt;I don't know where you come from, but nowadays in many countries, working class people is voting right and far right, why? Because the left is failing to address the problems they face in their everyday lives.\n\nThis isn't true though, really. Centrism is failing to address their problems. The entire point of neo-liberal neo-con conservatism is to, essentially, give the voters the illusion of choice while not rocking the boat. Working class people are most likely to vote the extremes because they have the most to gain and the least to lose.\n\nNow, if you examine those extremes, you'll find it's basically a contest between a group of people who are saying \"the immigrants are the cause of your problems\" and a group of people saying \"the rich are the cause of your problems\".\n\nWorking class people (and this is completely general, broad brush, stereotype sorta conjecture, but I think it makes sense) don't come into contact with \"the rich\". They might have a boss who is well off, or see rich people around, but it's much harder to associate the hoarding of wealth, influence and resource as the problem when it's not right on top of you. Couple that with the fact that a) rich people tend to be their employers, and so if we go after them, who will create jobs and b) the rich own the press, the media and have a huge propaganda machine designed to ensure that you don't blame them for your problems.\n\nThe *do* come in contact with immigrants. Immigrants are often worse off than they are, but having moved from a \"worse place\" (again, speaking in generalities, not talking about a doctor or a scientist or engineer) they are highly motivated to get on and work. They also might be more inclined to group up with other people who came from their country, since they have a shared experience with those people, and/or maybe they speak their native language.\n\nSo it's a *lot easier* to point to examples of immigrants coming and doing well in terms of housing and jobs, immigrants committing crime, point to the differences between immigrants and \"natives\" (religion for example) than it is to explain why the rich are shafting them.\n\nAnd if you're working class, there's a good chance you might not be educated *in the same way* or to the same level as middle class people. So you don't appreciate the trick that is being pulled on you, and the fact that it's the same trick that has been getting pulled ever since colonialism started breaking down and people from other countries started coming to the countries that colonised them.\n\nAgain, this is opinion and conjecture, but there's no getting round that if you start making the argument that working class people are \"naturally\" right wing. They aren't. The only reason we have a five day week, healthcare, votes, votes for women, civil rights and liberties, the abolishment of child labour, sick pay, holidays... and so on, is because of working class people *in direct opposition to* right wing middle and upper class bosses and owners.\n\nApologies for the very long response!\n\nName me one person you know that wants a low paying physical labor job... You just watch to much fox news man.  I live in an area where a mother of five got decapitated on a walking trail by an immigrant and that certainly can drive votes ... But yeah i guess we still got people who take the south park dey took are jerbs seriously.\n\nyou are american aren't you? \n\nThe younger working class people in europe mostly vote conservative. AfD in Germany ist the most popular party among ages 16-24\n\nNo, not American.\n\nThat's interesting though, got evidence for that please?\n\n[https://www.zdf.de/nachrichten/politik/deutschland/europa-wahl-afd-junge-wahler-100.html](https://www.zdf.de/nachrichten/politik/deutschland/europa-wahl-afd-junge-wahler-100.html)\n\nVery interesting, thanks.\n\nI struggled to find any reference to turnout in relation to age. Obviously this is one (European) election, where AfD are the (joint) most popular party among that age bracket. I seem to be coming across a lot of people saying \"this is because AfD are on tiktok talking about white replacement, and this is the main way in which young people are exposed to political discourse\" - but that's just opinion, of course.\n\nCertainly worrying, I wouldn't say thought that it backs up the idea that \"the younger working class people in europe mostly vote conservative\". Firstly because AfD isn't just \"conservative\", they're far-right. Secondly because it's one election, not an internal election, and it's the first time 16 and 17 year olds have ever been allowed to vote, and it's one country, not Europe generally.\n\nThat‚Äôs not what he‚Äôs said though, he‚Äôs directing people to vote in a specific way.¬†\n\nNothing wrong with asking people to not vote for a party founded by a convicted Holocaust denier that blames all of the country's problems on immigrants and children of immigrants. There's not much research that needs to be done to know that xenophobia and fascism is bad.\n\nAs I said, I'm responding to the quote (\"more than ever, we have to go vote\"), I can't actually watch the video, and I do kinda somewhat agree that we shouldn't listen if celebs tell us who to vote for.\n\nI was responding to his prompt to people to vote, which will likely meet his goal anyway, if it works. I don't think it's at all harmful for a person influential among young people to tell young people to vote.\n\nYes, he said, dont vote for facists and nazis and racists and a party that wants to reduce free speech and demicratic rights.\n\nThe younger French are leaning far more towards the right than left.\n\nInteresting, evidence for that?\n\n[deleted]\n\nIt's not a trope, it's broadly true, and the evidence you just provided suggests that the young are generally left wing (and, I agree, seem to be avoiding \"centrism\"), so I'm not sure what your point is...\n\n\"More young people than you might think support the extreme right\".\n\n(Edit: it also occurred to me that maybe the young extreme-right vote is more motivated to vote because, as per right wing populism, they have been groomed into thinking \"the west is under attack\" and so on).\n\nOK. That seems a bit woolly though.\n\nHowever, if more young people went out and voted generally... this would increase the vote for the left (and maybe the right, but the left much more). Which is my point.\n\nI mean you could make the argument that it doesn't even really matter. More voting is inherently a good thing anyway. Politicians have no interest in the needs and wants of the young when/if those people don't even vote.\n\n[deleted]\n\nI'm genuinely trying not to be confrontational but, yeah, of course. I wasn't assuming **all** \"young\" people avoid right wing parties, I was assuming they generally tend to not be right wing. Which I think is fair enough, and true.\n\nI agree that right wing parties don't tend to bother that much with young people. I don't quite know what it is about Reform that would appeal to disaffected young people. I wouldn't have said that they're particularly trying to get those people onboard. I would have said they were trying to get Brexit voters who feel like Brexit could have worked in the hands of a more competent government (or, maybe not even competent, just people who would have *believed* more), and, you know, the racists and completely objectionable xenophobe facebook dad types. And the young didn't vote for Brexit, so...\n\nIt's not just that though, it's attitude. Young people know what it's like to be starting out; they are more likely to live in cities, perhaps living in a house with other young people, maybe from other countries (especially if they're at university). They don't have much money. They want what's best for the society, not them specifically, because they benefit from better public services and so on anyway.\n\nOlder people tend to be more financially secure, more isolated, less caring about the public need as long as their needs are provisioned (even if it's by themselves, since they'd rather pay for them and their family than pay for the needs of strangers).\n\n***Tend to***. Obviously I'm talking generally.\n\nThe tories are an aberration of course because they haven't even been good at looking after those types of people; it's been a smash and grab raid for their donors and friends, and fuck everyone else. I guess a lot of Reform voters from the vote yesterday are these old, wealthy NIMBY types who don't want a Romanian family in the village/town.\n\n[deleted]\n\nI appreciate what you're saying, and my default is that people I'm speaking to are just laying out facts and opinions in a (fairly) dispassionate way (or at least impersonal), and I nearly never get upset with people (in fact even if they do get personal it doesn't bother me that much), so I just took it at face value that you disagreed on some things and agreed on others, I didn't take it as hostile. That's how I generally engage so I just assume the same of others. So no apology necessary.\n\nI agree that the left should not be complacent about the young. I think Labour in this GE have been complacent about the young (and in fact left wing people). Someone has already pointed out to me elsewhere that, among young people in Germany in the recent EU election, AfD were the joint most popular party. Which is bad/scary.\n\nI wasn't trying to be complacent about them, I just genuinely believe that if there was magically universal mandatory suffrage, politicians would pay more attention to the needs of young people, and we'd end up with less right wing (at least extreme) politicians in power. It's a circular system, I suppose.\n\nI tend to see things in terms of class, as a Marxist (not necessarily a communist, but I view things broadly through the lens of Marx at least); to me, in my opinion, older, richer people *know* they're in a class war and do everything in their power to fight it, and they have the majority of the resources available for fighting their part of that battle. The working class, on the whole, are less aware that they're in a class war (because of propaganda - Thatcher basically saying that the class war is over and working class people are now upwardly mobile because they can buy a council house(!) - and because of any number of distractions put in front of them - the telly, immigration, booze, drugs, ***football*** *-* and because of divide and conquer, i.e. have us fighting amongst ourselves, straight people vs. LGBTQ people, \"natives\" against immigrant people, anything as long as we don't start shooting eye daggers at the bloke in the range rover).\n\nBut because of that lens I tend to generalise older/richer people as right wing, young/poorer with left wing, because it's a kind of cheat-sheet matrix of power. You're correct to remind me though that this is just a simplistic lens.\n\nAnyway. As this is a football sub, how do you think England will fare against Switzerland? They've been dirge so far haven't they, in terms of performance? Who is your club, and are you excited for next season?\n\nNot if they're fascists\n\nYes, agreed. If the county was merely engaged in a usual political process, where one party had a slightly different political strategy to the other, then stay out. But this has the potential to dramatically worsen the lives of all non whites in France.\n\nDramatically worsen the lives of all people* in France. It might start with immigrants but it will quickly affect others as well.\n\nNot if they are responsible for rise of fascism\n\nBut you‚Äôre proving his point. You‚Äôre supporting Mbappe‚Äôs decision because he is opposing a fascist party, not because Mbappe says so.\n\nHuh?\n\nEveryone's a fascist for you\n\nNo, not everyone, Just the fascists.\n\nAnd whoever you label fascist on a whim\n\nMarine La Pen is a fascist by every standard definition of the word. Just as all these far-right wing nuts around the world are\n\nWhat makes them fascist? Is it being anti-immigration?\n\nThat's only part of it. I'm not on a football sub to give you a history and civics lesson. Look it up yourself (i know you won't bother) and compare the policies and rhetoric of far-right movements across the world today with those of Germany, Italy etc in the 1930s. \n\nThose that fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it.\n\nthe daughter of a right wing nut who tortured innocent people, who holds his views is not anything else but a fascist.\n\nBro, normal people aren‚Äôt labelled fascist. It‚Äôs enough to be fascist adjacent. But i take your point it‚Äôs thrown around a lot, my take is that it‚Äôs probably because it‚Äôs becoming more common and the use of Dog whistles is precisely how many people hide it.\n\nBut your needs should be humane.¬†\n\nWhat if they just need to be racist?\n\nFair play to Mbappe for beating this drum. üëè Keeping scumbag fascists out of govt is more important than a football tournament and not many big names anywhere are brave enough to nail their colours to the mast publicly. Major respect for him doing this\n\nlol, coming from a guy that sucked from qatars oil fields.\n\nFootballer worth 100s of millions of euros and former Qatari representative, thinks he can sway the opinions of ordinary people he has next 0 connection with (anymore)\n\nOrdinary people should not hate people by color or race. While i say there are big challenges which needs to be addressed the right wing parties offer easy answers for complex problems. Something that won't work. Also they are just not votable form an ethical standpoint¬†\n\nYeah I mean I guess there's a level of hypocrisy there to a point, doesn't make what he's saying any less spot on,\n\nThis worked last time...oh wait.\n\nHe's right. We don't need fascism in France. But RN voters don't even know for what they vote. They don't even read the program for the most...\n\nOh no no, they DO know what they vote for. FN/rn is a well documented / known fascist party. FN voters are openly racists\n\nNot true. Most of them even openly admit being racist.\n\nNot wanting foreigners that do not assimilate in your country is \"racist\"?\n\nWhen they openly tell black people to ‚Äògo back to your dog kennel‚Äô, which is defended by Le Pen, yes, they are fucking racist.\n\nWhich event are you talking about?\n\nhttps://www.guadeloupe.franceantilles.fr/actualite/politique/pour-marine-le-pen-dire-va-a-la-niche-a-une-personne-noire-nest-pas-forcement-raciste-992363.php\n\nThanks I wasn't sure if you were talking about  the father the daughter LePen\n\nWhen asked, alot of Front Nationales (~50%) voters said they where rqcist to the journalist. They themselves make the claim that they are racist.\n\nDont you live in a country where foreigners came in, genocided the local population and set a new cultural tone? \n\nWhich assimilation should be done? To which culture.\n\nAs for your question, yes. Its called an euphemism\n\nOh people are going to vote, but for Le Pen.¬†\n\nI look forward to his ongoing support for the democratic process\n\nWell now I'm a fan\n\nNothing better than a multi millionaire footballer telling the plebs how to vote\n\nOh no how dare footballers say to not vote for racist fascists\n\nGlad to see it's working(!)\n\nMore like a victim of racism tells people to vote for the less racist options\n\nFuck fascists always\n\nMacron's pet turtle\n\nAnd about as smart as one\n\nAnd even then smarter than all fascists combined\n\nWell said Mbappe now return the money that comes from an even shittier regime aka your previous employers from PSG.\n\nlove mbappe but people should do their own thinking before voting. A certain section of immigrants do cause violence and don't assimilate. It's the same everywhere.\n\nNinja turtle earning 1m a month trying to tell people what is best for them when he does not remotely understand what is their reality. \nI don‚Äôt really blame him or hate on his attempt in the press. I blame this social media era that show ¬´life¬ª that is not real for 99% of people.\n\nHe do know far better then you what is best for alot of people in france. He grew up in one of the poorest parts of Paris. He know better then most how it is to grow up with little money.\n\nWasnt he taking millions for a totalitarian goverment? He only knows whats best for him, didnt hear him talking about these issues for the past 7 years\n\nThe guy has been in the AS Monaco youth academies from age 13 lmao. Let's not pretend he was living in squalor until last year. He even went to a private school as a kid.  \nTrained at Clairefontaine as a kid, invited by Real Madrid to train with them at the age of 11, flew out to London after being courted by Chelsea at 14.\n\nMbapp√© isn't the dirt poor migrant kid from the Parisian ghetto you think he is.\n\nNo he doesn't.  People are quick to forget.\n\nI dunno man, me personally I don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs the fcking pope, Mbappe or the beggar down the street telling me to vote against facists I would heed their advice.\n\n[removed]\n\n?\n\nBetter to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak and remove all doubt.\n\nFor all the Turks here\n\nThere a difference between a press conference and a goal celebration\n\nIf someone asked Demiral about his political views during a press event and he‚Äôd said ‚Äúyeah I love this organisation that killed, persecuted and oppressed people‚Äù I would take objection with the interviewer for raising the question, not with demiral for answering truthfully \n\nAlso if Mbappe at his next goal takes of his shirt to show some sort of sign underneath criticising lepen I think he should receive a similar treatment to demiral\n\nI wholeheartedly disagree and saying that opposing a fascist party publicly and supporting one are two very different things. As supposedly anti-fascist societies equating the two is very dangerous\n\nhow do you 'vote' for a 'fascist'. I'm not european just very curious. Fascism is characterised by dictators,autocracy etc. So they are brought in by military coups or otherwise. How do you exactly vote for them and if you do whats the worry, since they can be removed post their term if they are shit anyways. Most importantly, how does a party which openly supports abolishing elections,(im assuming they did that since you called them fascist) not get disqualified by the electoral body.\n\nAside from the answers already given, I want to say that you're getting things mixed up.\n\nImagine a fascist. A person who fully believes Mussolini's or Hitler's doctrine. Now, if that person wants to get into politics, they can't simply say \"I'm a fascist! Vote for me!\", as that would probably not make him the most popular candidate around, and is even a crime in some countries.\n\nNow, that person can join or start a \"far right party\" that can grow and gather parlamentary seats or win executive elections. Now, let's think that this person doesn't go for a coup d'√©tat, as you said, and doesn't turn the country into a fascist dictatorship and just remains in power for the time established in the constitution.\n\nOK, we have simply a far right government. Well, there's a lot of damage that can come from it, and the lack of a genocide is not a very high bar to think that it's OK.\n\nLet's see the example of far right Bolsonaro (I don't call him a fascist - in moderate debates - for historic accuracy) in Brazil. He openly defends the Brazilian dictatorship (not fascist, but not unakin to it) and in his term he adopted a similar agenda, stopping only where the constitution forced him to. However, he gave multiple statements trying to rile up not only the population (which supported him) but also to bring the military closer to him and fire up an unstable political setting. He also took a shot at the electoral process every chance he got, casting suspicion over it. You'd think that would be just in case he lost, but he said that there was fraud even when he won, saying he should've won by a larger margin. It was pretty clear that Bolsonaro wanted to stage a coup d'√©tat, and now there's an ongoing investigation about whether he went beyond \"wanting\" and actually planned it. If he wasn't so politically inept when it comes to charisma and negotiating, he would have had a chance to succeed. Unsurprisingly, he was recently judged for his attacks to democracy and banned from elections for the next 8 years. Oh, and if you remember the Trumpist attack to the Capitol, there was one in Bras√≠lia too, which he obviously backed.\n\nBolsonaro's term was marked by limiting workers' rights and social services. Brazil also needed economic austerity, which he adopted, but to no avail, he somehow managed to deepen the crisis. He also isolated Brazil from international trading. Also, there's the pandemic, where he was not only disastrous, but actively contributed for its destructive effects in the country: he said the disease wasn't a big deal, ignored vaccine offers, spoke openly against vaccination and social distancing, mocked most preventive measures and even mocked sick people. But the pandemic was an \"episode\", did Bolsonaro's \"ordinary\" work cause people to die? Well, there's a reason why people call him genocidal. He didn't implement a plan of actively killing indigenous people, but he dismantled a lot of the services responsible for looked after their rights made no effort to repress violence against them or the predatory advance of plantations/digging/timber over their lands - legal or illegal (that's why he's called genocidal in Brazil, Covid just made it bigger). In fact, he always alluded to the fact that \"there were riches in indigenous people's land, so why can't we get to them?\"\n\nIn short, even though Bolsonaro is in a democratic setting, he's anti-democratic and pushed Brazilian democracy to its limits (trying to break them) and hurt a lot of people and jeopardized the country's future prospects doing so. He wasn't a \"dictator\" from a \"dictatorship party\", but a lt of his ideals were put in practice. So a \"fascist\" in a \"fascist party\" isn't unthinkable.\n\nThe actual fascists we‚Äôve had have been elected before their country became autocratic.\n\nHitler was voted in to power\n\nYou vote for Marine Le Pen. Then you vote for facists.\n\nIn the US, you vote for Trump if you want to vote for facists.\n\nBoth of them have similar goal, which is to remake their countries into an autocracy (like current Russia, who support both of these 2 with money and other stuff). To remove liberal rights like free speech and voting rights and so on.\n\nTrump did his best to not get removed post his term by staging a self-coup.\n\nIt's because they're not fascists. They're a far-right, populist and nationalist party. Some people think that's the same.\n\nRead some history, the most famous fascist came to power through a democratic election process.\n\nBots going at it.\n\nWow, just so arrogant to think that his personal view of politics should extend to the rest of the country.\n\nHint:  It doesn't.\n\nIts not a political gesture. Its a racist and nationalistic sign that has been associated with genocide and the massacres of multiple minorities inside and around turkey.\n\nYou know exactly what the sign means, as does Demiral and all of the other people trying to change the meaning or making it less than it is.\n\nDont compare it with something that is not comparable and just accept that the sign demiral showed was a fascistic sign an he was stupid to do that. He deserves the suspension\n\nOk bot\n\n[removed]\n\nNot really but i saw that it wasnt posted as a reply for another comment as i intended to\n\nAin‚Äôt you got a ball your supposed to be kicking about\n\nVote nfp right, they can stop rn not your mate macron.\n\nAhh the little baby can't handle differing viewpoints, newsflash Mbappe people DID vote, you're just salty they didn't vote the way YOU wanted them them, a habit among celebrities it seems,\n\nNow pipe down and score an important goal for once (if you're capable of it)\n\nNo. Now you just forgot to read, or msybe yiu just dont understand what you read.\n\nBecause the point he is making goes very far above your head.\n\nBoo hoo.

Always.\n\nSo what‚Äôs the alternative to capitalism? \nNo one actually argues capitalism is flawless but every other largely tested form was a failure and often ended in blood baths‚Ä¶\n\nYou don't have to believe in full socialism, but we could at least try some kind of mixed social denocratic economy again like in the post-war era. If that works out well we can opt for more socialism if we want to.\n\n\nCapitalism has¬†become extremely dominant over the last 40 years. Everything is utterly commercialized and democracy have become so weak that people feel that they can barely effect the future anymore. That is very dangerous and a reason why fascism appeals to people once again.\n\nCapitalism is always a blood bath. The fact that you don't see blood right outside your door doesn't mean that people don't die daily in order to produce wealth for a small amount of people. Wars happen just for rich individuals to get richer. That's my point. You are a hypocrite if you say that \"We are in danger of fascism\" when you have fascism in so many other places of the world just so the strong west countries can satisfy their needs (For example it is easy to search and see how USA promoted and funded religious extremists in Afghanistan in order to overhtrow the socialist goverment which resulted in fascism of course or simillary what USA did on Iran or what France, England, Belgium have done to many African countries). When capitalism can't satsify the bourgeois needs any longer and at the same time people are mad over status quo (what is happening in Europe right now) reactionary far right politicians will grab the chance, be promoted by every media platform (direct or indirect) and come into power.\n\n&gt; Capitalism is always a blood bath.\n\nI swear some of you guys have never opened up a history book in your entire lives.\n\nWhat is wrong and historically incorrect in what I said?\n\nlmao\n\nSo uefa only bans you if you support the right. If a French player came out in support of Le Pen i'd love to see what their reaction would be\n\n1). Of course your name is Patrick Bateman making comments like this\n\n2). Right wing support is always viewed with more scrutiny as, typically, they are linked with frequent acts of violence. \n\n3). Exactly like the Demiral case where he was not ‚Äúsupporting‚Äù the right but instead making gestures linking to death and genocide. \n\nHope that clears it up for you.\n\n[removed]\n\nI can think of a pretty major war straight off the bat chief that has kind of redefined modern views and landscapes, and certainly treatment of the right-wing. \n\nSeems to still be at the heart of a lot of issues we see with the right today. \n\nGlad you got a laugh though.\n\nAre you being sarcastic? There's no way this is a serious take lmaooo. History doesn't agree that right wing politics lead to violence???\n\n[removed]\n\nThat's not what you said you goofy lol. You said it's laughable to say that right wing politics frequently lead to violence and that history doesn't agree with that. Which one is it?? \n\nAll politics leads to violence but not in quite the same way. Something like the Holocaust, Armenian Genocide, or even Muslim extremism are almost direct policy. People going to war for their prefered form of government isn‚Äôt the same as that.\n\n[removed]\n\n&gt;History doesn't agree that ONLY right wing politics lead to violence dumbass.\n\nThat wasn't what the first comment said lmao and again that isn't what you said at first. You're changing your argument because you realize how dumb it was and trying to pass it off as my error, not gonna work lol. \n\n&gt;There's just as many war crimes and genocides commited throughout history by left wing ideology\n\nList these genocides. \n\nYou sound like an arrogant conservative dickhead who doesn't even understand his own positions lmao.\n\n[removed]\n\nHitler wasn't a socialist.  I don't care that the party was called the National Socialists, you have to look beyond the name and look at the policies. \n\nThe Democratic Republic of North Korea isn't a Democracy despite the name, as another example of where you have to look beyond the name and see what is actually happening.\n\nNice deleted comment as well bro.\nNext time you go to call someone a ‚Äúdumbass‚Äù and then coward out and delete your message, maybe don‚Äôt drop the insult in the part of the message that shows up in the preview window. \n\nOr maybe don‚Äôt write messages when your blood is boiling to the point you can‚Äôt even think straight.\n\n[removed]\n\nI saw the notification mate, I‚Äôm not blind. And seeing as how the comment isn‚Äôt here now, you‚Äôve clearly deleted it for one reason or another.\n\nThink before you speak in future, it‚Äôs actually surprisingly easy to do. \n\nThe patronising little maternal comment isn‚Äôt as cool and dismissive as you think it is either.\n\nSo go ban him for 2 games too football should be not political he should stfu\n\nMaybe he should try to be better on the pitch instead of yapping about politics to the press.\n\nBro's scared üò≠\n\nScared of what lol ?\n\n[deleted]\n\nThat is not even close to being the same thing. While one is saying his opinion on the elections and tries to reason with people about electing a far right nationalist the other is showing signs of a fascist nationalalistic movement.\n\nOf course Demiral would be suspended when he did that.\n\nI‚Äôm confused. Is one of them not a political gesture?\n\nMate, a nazi salute is a political gesture.\n\nThe point is the connotation it carries, you can‚Äôt just say ‚Äúthey‚Äôre all political gestures‚Äù and call them the same, it‚Äôs not that black and white.\n\nThe point is that both are\n\nYeah, what Mbappe is doing is more political than what Demiral did. Its a pretty slippery slope if we allow involving politics in football when it fits what we like and ban players when we dont\n\n*It's a slippery slope if we allow fascism in football. There, fixed it for you\n\nI think you don‚Äôt get what‚Äôs going on here. For a long time, far right deemed the France football team as ¬´¬†not that French because they are all Africans¬†¬ª. The shit hit the fan when in 2010 France players refused to train, and a lot of racist comments were made at the time.\n\n\nSince 2012, France football team changed a lot especially regarding values. But those racist comments are not forgotten.\n\nWas that comment meant to me? Because i get that and it had nothing to do with what im talking about\n\nI was justifying the side chosen by Mbapp√©. RN has a lot of racist deputy running for elections, and I think racism is a thing sport is globally trying to get rid of! \n\nSo I don‚Äôt think you should ban players speaking openly about a political group that treated footballers as monkeys for years. Even more if the concerned political group was created by a former SS and WWII collaborationist!\n\nI dont have a problem with the side mbappe chose. What im saying is that either we allow players to bring politics into football or we dont. But you cant pick and choose when to ban them for that because it is a slippery slope as i said. \n\nI for one dont really trust uefa to police the political discourse considering they haven‚Äôt banned israel yet\n\nCommercial associations like UEFA or FIFA are trying to make profit from competitions. They‚Äôll often do what‚Äôs more in their financial interest. \n\n\nAnyway, as they‚Äôre trying to raise awareness against racism, they won‚Äôt ban a player taking position against a party known for candidates with racist backgrounds. Some leftists made a France map with each RN candidate who had some racist or antisemite background, and it‚Äôs 5 not 5 or 10 candidates‚Ä¶\n\nThere's no fucking way you're actually comparing these two instances..."

The guy is pure grit and commitment.\n\n*John Terry has entered the chat*\n\nAnd statistically speaking probably your wife...\n\nI like these stats\n\nUgh that‚Äôs not respectful to his wife tho I don‚Äôt even know her lol\n\nWhat the fuck, I've seen the exact same comments above me before, like months ago. üòê\n\nRealising it now tbh. I guess I was too drunk on happiness to think before I spoke (typed).\n\nDon't kink shame, maybe they like it that way\n\nwdym slept with his wife??\n\nFr Hummels and schlotterbeck were amazing across both legs\n\nOf course - on one leg you couldnt play football properly\n\nHummels wants to join the National team again.\n\nBut the post truly was the mvp.\n\nI have a personal(!) feud and history with him, but honor where honor is due.\n\nLmaoooo they made their sub private üò≠üòÇ\n\nI'm glad they're taking this well.\n\nI‚Äôm sure they don‚Äôt want to leak their yearly designer merch discussions. PSG- Uefa designer merch winners x16\n\nHahahhaa I took a look just after they lost and it looked like users from every other club were swamping them with snarky comments. They are the most hated club so... XD\n\nYeah, I hate clubs that try to buy their trophies. The only thing worse is the glory hunters who support them until they become a shit team again.\n\nThey, as a whole, are WEAK.\n\nAll them billions and how many cups?\n\nThat‚Äôs why i cant search it up üòÇ\n\nTo be honest can't blame them getting shutout in both semi final games is embarrassing as hell\n\ncan't win even by paying the refs, imagine that\n\nYou know the reason moderators turn football club subreddits private tend to be because of the kind of person that makes posts like what we're commenting on spam their forums with five year old level maturity after things like this happen\n\nAs opposed to pregame where you couldn't go five steps without seeing PSG fanbois talking about how Germany was a farmer's league and Dortmund had no chance and didn't deserve to be in the semi-final at all next to PSG?\n\nEdit: thanks for the cursing followed by a block. Definitely following your own advice. Doubt you recognize the irony.\n\nWait, PSG fans calling the Bundesliga a farmer's league? JFC\n\nThe fucking hilarity\n\nFive year olds seem like they're always having fun. What's not to like?\n\nThat they're also living incarnations of satan's will if they feel like it\n\nStill funny though‚Ä¶\n\nThe one time I went there I saw someone explain that football transfers work in the way that you pay the selling club over the course of the contract, so Bellingham costs Real Madrid 20 million per year for 5 years, and no one objected. Peak stupidity.\n\nAfter everything if Reus wins The Champions League in his final game for Dortmund, it will be absolutely poetic.\n\nGerman clubs and football poetry seems to be the theme this season\n\nEspecially if it‚Äôs against Bayern.\n\nLeverkusen winning the unbeaten treble    \nDortmund winning Champions League\n\nthe Harry Kane curse in full swingüíÄ\n\nI‚Äôm subscribed. Fully.\n\nPoetry would be Kaiserslautern beating Leverkusen and winning the DFB-Pokal.\n\ntbh i feel so bad for him, but am so much enjoying it lol\n\nThere's another match against As Roma and they are quite famous to be a wildcard. Let's see what will happen tomorrow.\n\nIf Bayern makes it to Wembley and loses the final I would have a hard time being super sad for too long. This would just be too poetic. It's a similar story with Mats. I'm pretty sure he'll end his career after this season but just refuses to take any of Reus' spotlight.\n\nIf the Kane curse is real, Dortmund is winning\n\nBayern Dortmund again at Wembley after 2013 would also be mad! I don't think anyone predicted them two In the Final.\n\nWell even as someone who follows the Bundesliga I didn't see these two coming so far. \nBut yesterday was just another Terzic Black Magic Fuckery. \nSorry for swearing I cannot put it in other wordsüòÇ\n\nYes, because Bayern will play a final at home next season. The circle closes for M√ºller and Neuer who hang up their boots after that season.\n\nLike Drogba with Chelsea\n\nDortmund's campaign this champions league was severely underrated\n\nEvery rated them super low. Most people believed they'd get eliminated in the Group of Death. They shared a side with Atletico, who were looking very strong, Inter, who were one of the top candidates to make it all the way again, and Barca and PSG. And now they are playing the finals. It's unbelievable. What a magical run.\n\nTwo options now to complete the magic.\n\nThey may win vs Bayern, in the vengeance. Or vs Madrid, the team that does not lose UCL finals.\n\nAs Madrid fan, if they win tomorrow, it will be the sort of UCL final that will be a little bit sad if they win.\n\nYeah, I'm a Bayern fan and I'd love nothing more than for us to win. But if Dortmund wins this in the last game of Reus and possibbly Hummels then it's impossible to be a hater. It's objectively a fairytale.\n\nSo happy for BvB. I always preach that those Germans play some of the best football. Now we may see an all\nGerman final .\n\nThat last final‚Ä¶ I got so sad watching Bvb lose to Bayern\n\nHopefully this is their year. a decade later‚ú®\n\nPost Saint Germain\n\nGold post\n\nWho‚Äôs PSG fans going to blame now üòÇ\n\nThe post\n\nThis post?\n\nAlso the post\n\nAll the posts? Perhaps Deutsche Post?\n\nThe No UCL for. Mbappe Post\n\nThe Washington Post?\n\nAnd the post\n\nI meant the other post also\n\nBut i meant the post.\n\nThe bar?\n\nYes the 6th bar\n\nThe defender left his post?\n\nDid he also hit the bar?\n\nMessi, because he had a vacation in Miami. ü§£ü§£üòÅüòÅ\n\nBro, for real, Messi, Suarez and Busquets are playing seriously well. Like incredibly well. Messi is still scoring absolutely crazy goals! He‚Äôs not playing his age, he‚Äôs playing like he‚Äôs 30. You can watch the inter Miami highlights on YT and you‚Äôll be shocked at how good these ‚Äúold‚Äù players still are, and how well they still link up! They seriously play with one mind.\n\nHe's playing against amateurish MLS defenses. MLS only invests in retirement forwards, the defenders are mostly college football players who would never make it in a European league. That's why utterly mediocre players like Glesnes and Kai Wagner from the German 4th tier are the best defenders in the league.\n\nInter Miami signed 3 players with no legs left and go from last to first place in a season, it's not a serious league.\n\nInexperience causing bad mistakes (Warren and Beraldo, could really feel their age), poor finishing, Ruiz prioritizing spinning in a circle with the ball over passing it forwards, midfield being completely disorganized, the star Mboopi not having a good game (BVB defense good). Also bad luck to be fair, although BVB were still good. Guess all our luck was used up against Barca\n\ncan blame a bunch, how about start with warren, PSG ain t youth developement so he can disappear right quick cause he s been dropping stinker after stinker after his injury. Can blame mbappe, 1 million a week and can t score a goal to save his life, the only thing that he helps with is his presence and what it does to oposition defenders, doesn t amount to anything with experienced players like hummels tho etc\n\nFootball won today ! Fuck PSG Qatar and their oil slave money!\n\nFuck league one in General. There Are to few people speaking out against that corrupt league. Give their teams extra time off from the league to prepare for international Matches.\n\nFuck league one.\n\nLigue 1*\n\nUber Eats League*\n\nMcdonalds next seasonüòÖ\n\nDude Eredivisie and Liga nos did it too.\n\nPlus we have holes in the calendar so might profit\n\nHow the hell does that make them corrupt? It makes perfect sense for a league to help out their own teams in Europe.\n\nYou're an idiot.\n\nMost football money didn‚Äôt come from charity, especially in rich clubs / league like Premier League.\n\nDude again its not only the money. They literally moved psgs matchday so they had more time to prepare for Dortmund. Thats a whole other level and honestly its a fucking farce to call anything like that fair play.\n\nLigue one should be punished for that. I Hope none of their clubs win anything international for the next 20 years at least.\n\nThey moved Marseille's too and they fucking hate Marseille\n\nWhy wouldn't a league try to help one of their own clubs? It benefits the entire country. Better coefficient points = more money going to French teams.\n\nWhat's wrong with that?? The premier league could do that as well if they wanted to, nothing corrupt about it\n\nLa Liga did for Madrid &gt;&gt;&gt; Bayern, too\n\nSo glad all that oil money doesn‚Äôt guaranteed success, and is beaten by a legit club that is owned by the fans and not knee deep in debts.\n\nHaven‚Äòt seen Dembele play in a long while, but is it only me to whom he seemed quite lacking in terms of really being able to create anything remotely dangerous offensively? Also I noticed quite a few technical flaws today. As I said, I can‚Äòt at all extrapolate from this one match I saw him play, and I won‚Äòt, but I thought he would pose a bigger problem to Dortmund‚Äòs defense.\n\nThat's just regular Demb√©l√© for you, would've been the same in qf if cancelo was competent at defending\n\nafter seeing him in psg, i now have zero regrets selling him.\n\nLaporta Reddit ID found\n\nHe is shit even in Ligue 1\n\nHe is a total goofball. He has good games and then has a shit ton of bad ones. Open net against Liverpool comes to mind. He does not have a good football brain. He does have talent.\n\nYeah totally inconsistent. Glimpses of brilliance but looks like an amateur other times. I would say he has a lot of potential but he‚Äôs 26 now, I‚Äôm not sure he will ever reach the level he could have been.\n\nWith them and Manchester City knocked out, we can rest assured that Football will not be destroyed again this year.\n\nCouldn't have happened to a nicer team. Football and passionate fans won tonight.\n\nAs much as I dislike PSG, they have great fans and Ultras tbf.\n\nTheir fans and ultras are the worst for what they do to their own players and other fanbases\n\nDembele forgot he don't play for Dortmund anymore\n\nFelt like my usual fifa game, hitting the post every goddam time. But feels good because it was PSG :))\n\nFor real..I would have screamed that the game is scripted after hitting all those posts (fuck fc24)\n\nDORTMUND DID GOD\"S WORK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nPSG and Mbappe were more focused on visiting Real in Wembley while Dortmund wanted to win the game.\n\nPSG had loads of chances but when your head‚Äôs not there you‚Äôre gonna be shite.\n\nYou can buy amazing players, but you can make them win\n\nFootball won\n\nIf we get rid of all the teams that just try to buy trophies, then football really wins. We will see tonight.\n\nhow sweet it is to see a fan/supporter-owned club beat this Oil-money superteam...\n\nGo Bayern!!! and let's have a full German ECL Final.\n\nBro, hate to break it to you, but BVB is not fan owned. It is 100% a publicly traded stock company.\n\nPretty sure it is fan owned, leverkusen, leipzig and wolfsburg are the exceptions to 50+1 in the bundesliga\n\nSomething about seeing the \"lazy\" Sancho play well in a Champions League semi over two legs while we, his parent club, sit mid table in the PL and are recovering from a 4-0 spanking at the hands of the mighty Crystal Palace, doesnt sit right with me.\n\nJadon had a dream when he came to BVB. \nBe a big player in PL and for his country. \nAs a young player he gave everything to make the dream come true.. and BVB gave him every opportunity to become better and have the stage to show this. \n\nWith his transfer ManUtd he reached his goal.. and didn‚Äôt know how to go on. \nThen having hard times at ManUtd and after EURO.. he just couldn‚Äôt find his passion and lost all credit within ManUtd. \n\nHe just wanted to go back to the happy times at BVB. \nNow this CL story gave him that back.. we will see how he go on after this one.\n\nI dno why you‚Äôve put lazy in quotation marks like we hadn‚Äôt watched him for a year under 3 different managers fail to do pretty much anything. \n\nPlaying well at Dortmund doesn‚Äôt mean he wasn‚Äôt lazy at Utd\n\nIf Sancho wins CL with Dortmund, theoretically it will be easier for Man Utd to sell him to other clubs at a higher price. So I guess it is a win-win situation?\n\nI would much rather see Dortmund win than Real or Bayern anyway,, and Sanchos value would definitely go up. Still feels like a kick in the teeth tho. He was \"expelled\" from the squad only to have a much better season than us.\n\nDiscarded by multiple managers for the same reason, say what you want but his attitude speaks for itself\n\nIf Fraudbappe thinks, I disagree. If Fraudbappe speaks, I ignore. If Fraudbappe fails, I'm happy. If the world is against Fraudbappe, I am the world. If Fraudbappe has 7 billion fans, I am none of them. If Fraudbappe has no haters, it's because I no longer exist.\n\nGood.\n\nspeaking as a geordie, i am glad\n\nWhy pay $200 million for Mbappe when you have a better player like Vini\n\nMbappe is better\n\nAnd real Madrid is a brand. They want the best players no matter what. Biggest club in the world\n\nNo one is going to get upset about anything regarding wages etc. Massive signing on fees are normal\n\nI'm not sure if Mbappe is better. Vini has the most G+A in the champions league in the last 3 years combined\n\nHe also played the most games. Mbappe has a better average. Also Real Madrid are hands down the better team lets be honest (i dont mean to say that vini is getting carried)\n\nI'm not denying mbappe is better but it is easier to get a better average If more of your games are in group stage and r16 than higher knockout games\n\nBecause you can get Mbappe for free... Also, por que no los dos? Are you fr?\n\nMbappe is not free. Why would Real Madrid move Vini from his favorite position when Mbappe is not good in UCL\n\nClearly I'm referring to the transfer fee, which will be ‚Ç¨0.00. When you have a chance to get a player you should be paying ‚Ç¨200 in fees alone to get for zero fee, you do it 10/10, even if you just sell him in a year. It's basic business sense. \n\nWhatever you pay him in salary, you can just look at it as playing with house money for all the savings on transfer. \n\nThere's no real counter argument here that's based in any real logic. If he's disruptive to the team, don't play him,, sell him in January. Even if you sell to Crystal Palace for ‚Ç¨30 million, you've still made money. Like this is laughably easy to figure out here. It would be absolute malpractice from the front office not to try and see if it works in the team, and without paying a transfer fee, you don't have the financial pressure of having to force it to work.\n\nM'bapp√© is already top 10 scorer in the history of the UCL, wtf are you talking about\n\nIt would have been an anomaly if PSG weren't out of the UCL.\n\nFuck PSG üåàüåàüåà\n\nLyon and Marseille are the true historic Ligue 1 clubs, PSG have no history and are more plastic then a landfill.\n\nMarseille fans were so happy about that just because they can flex being the only French club to have a UCL.\n\nDortmund reaching the final is a great news for football. Great way to do business, buy young players, sell them for good money, invest back into the team. \n\nThis is their second final since 2013. For some comparasion, only Real Madris has played more finals from them since that year.\n\nSuper happy for Dortmund, well deserved! But Liverpool has also played more finals üëç (Three: 2018, 2019, 2022)\n\nAnd Bayern have equalled them 2013,2020\n\nCorrect. As have Juventus (2015, 2017), Atletico (2014, 2016), Man City (2021, 2023).\n\nMy mistake, apart from Madrid and Liverpool.\n\nNo worries, mate! I really hope I didn‚Äôt come across as an ‚Äôackchually‚Äô kinda guy haha!\n\nAll ok, I completely forgot about the Hotspur final. \n\nBut really impressive for Dortmund, they sold Belingham and Haaland and reached the final. Barcelona should have knocked out PSG if they haven't self destructed in the second game.\n\nGood.\n\nPSG was straight up cursed or something, I don't think I've watched game with so many near misses and hits on the wood work before üòÇ\n\nReus has been my favourite footballer since I was 10. 11 years later I hope he can win the UCL and finish his time at Dortmund in styleüëå\n\nA tale as old as time...\n\nA win for football!\n\nBarca cursed PSG ü§£\n\nLol, if this happens again next season to whoever defeats Barca, we can start calling it the ‚ÄúBarca curse‚Äù!\n\nFinally, inner peace.\n\nYeah they never winning it,  just like arsenal\n\ngenuinely hope its dortmund vs bayern that would be hype\n\nWe would see Reus vs Kane in a UCL finals ü•µ\n\nIn your face PSG, next time be more humble. The fans, Enrique and Mbapp√© should learn from this defeat.\n\nHell yeah\n\nLove this. Fuck Qatar $aint Germaine.\n\nSay what you want about Messi‚Äôs performance when he was at PSG, but he would have surely buried at least one of those chances, absolutely ridiculous.\n\nMessi was carrying an injury and covid made it worse for him in his first season but second season he was quite good and could have even better season if Mbappe and Hakimi didn't make sure he was isolated in the right wing for most part!\n\nVery close game tbh. Dortmund is a great team but I wouldn't they they deserved more than PSG tonight. Also if you support a Premier League club and you're crying about PSG having too much money you can fuck right off. Premier League spends more than all top European leagues combined.\n\nYou don't score 0 goals in 2 games and deserve to win.\n\nI dont moan, but tbf, im pretty sure most prem fans moan because they dont like where the money comes from. Same reason everyone here hates man city, and both clubs have fan bases full of entitled cunts...\n\nIf you loose 2 games 1:0 each you dont deserve IT more. Period.\n\nThey were cooky acting like it was already done. In this type of competition rule number one always respect your opponent\n\nI never want to hear about Hakimi being an elite player ever again lol\n\nMy favourite day of the year\n\nI wholeheartedly agree!\n\nGreat news üòÅü§£\n\nP$G*\n\nGood.\n\nFootball heritage\n\nLet me guess it was Messi and Neymar's fault again. P$G is a small club.\n\n[removed]\n\nPSG bottled yet again\n\nAll I have is my congrats to my dear skriniar and hope he enjoys this sweet moment.\n\nShame . How am I gonna sleep tonight ..\n\nI know, it‚Äôs hard to sleep when you are too happy about something!\n\nPSG back to the farmers and corrupt league they go.\n\nI mean, I am not happy that Mbappe is missing the final, but I AM SO HAPPY that this fake team is missing on a final, and Reus abd Hummels will get to play in it! üòç\n\nK\n\nMbappe to Dortmund confirmed\n\nGood. Such an unlikeable club.\n\nThe sky is blue\n\nRim tim tagi dim\n\nYeah, this didn't surprise me one bit. People have been sleeping on how good Dortmund has been in Europe this year. After watching them against Athletico on both legs and last week against PSG, their intensity and work rate are very, very commendable. So them knocking out PSG wasn't surprising at all.\n\nGerman derby please\n\nThis is the history of PSG.\n\n*This is Football heritage*\n\nLolz in the chat\n\nLet the cookies crumble üç™\n\nWhat good news to wake up to!\n\nIf we do get the 2013 rematch and results, while it would be sad to see Dortmund lose after such a great run- it would also be pretty funny to watch Bayern win the CL after this absolutely dogshit season\n\nThe storylines this season have been elite. Going into it we had kane potentially winning a trophy but now the kane curse ending bayerns streak is just comedy. We also have modric winning the ucl in what will probably be his last season and Madrid winning the 15th ucl. Reus winning the ucl in a der klassiker final would be absolutely insane though.\n\nTen Hag cancels Sanchos loan tomorrow morning.\n\nPSG is a clown show. ü§£ü§£ü§£\n\nAmen to that!\n\nWhy would Pessi do this?\n\nI‚Äôm smoking on that Mbappe pack\n\nCongrats to Dortmund, PSG with a super unlucky game. Ligue 1 still got as many CLs as Romania Scotland and Yugoslavia btw\n\nBvB was better 10 out of 10 times\n\nStill bigger than dortmund"

    "all_comment_text": "To be fair he really stuck it out in china, clearly made a connection with the local fans and didn't just take the money and run like a lot of other players (yes, he did make LOTS of money lol). I respect that.\n\nI've seen him around in Shanghai walking around with his family a few times. He does get asked for pictures a few times but doesn't get mobbed and he's always happy to stop by and take pictures with fans. Definitely has a good life in Shanghai. Makes a shit ton of money while doing what he loves, lives in a really nice modern city and he can still walk around the city not exactly like a normal person but relatively unbothered.\n\n[deleted]\n\nAs someone from Shanghai I don‚Äôt think the flipside is so cruel. The compensation is actually really really good, and a lot of old houses remain even in central commerce districts. The Shanghai people I know don‚Äôt have too much sympathy to these ‚Äúnail households‚Äù that refuse all compensations. These households cannot even agree upon themselves to install an elevator in the building, and they are mainly old people. For aggregate welfare, shanghai as a city needs a lot more houses, and govt is doing a lot to find a transfer plan to offer these people.\n\nYou're not even getting paid to say that üòÇ\n\nI wish I am paid! Of course it is totally my personal biased opinion as a middle class, but if you take a shot from air around the central business district in Pudong you see a lot of old buildings. I am not the only one hoping they to be torn down and replaced by apartments that can hold way more people.\n\nNot even one of the most communist countries of the planet is immune to capitalism\n\nIt hasn‚Äôt been one of the most communist countries of the planet since 1978 (when Deng Xiaoping came to power), and certainly not since 1992 (when he retired).\n\nAre your impressions of China 50 years out of date?¬†\n\nNo communist country is a communist country, they say they are tho. They claim to be communist and they give liberals an excuse to say that communism is a failed ideology (which it is, currently, but it‚Äôs because we let money and greed always come before the people)\n\nThe US claims to be a democracy without being a real democracy.\n\nU.S.A. claims to be a representative democracy, electoral democracy or indirect democracy not a true democracy.\n\nThe National Socialist German Workers' Party wasn't particularly socialist either. China's official title is the People's Republic of China - we can debate whether it's really a republic (although they are obviously free to define \"People's Republic\" as they so choose), but any communist labels are retained purely for historical continuity, ideological control, and political legitimacy. I only ever hear Americans calling China \"communist\" nowadays, to boot. \n\nThere are lots of reasons Communism can be said to have failed, but to address your point perhaps at least one reason is that it *failed* to account for both i) money, which is required to run economies (again, can argue but the alternatives are mostly worse or entirely impractical) and provide incentive structures, and ii) human greed, which is intrinsic. You can teach chimpanzees to use money and they will literally start prostituting themselves for it - these things are deeply hard-wired, and even a global superpower running an ideological social experiment were unable to escape the social dynamics introduced by these factors. Marxism is a nice theory with noble goals - but it doesn't actually *work*, which is why Communism failed.\n\nNext you‚Äôre gonna tell me the Democratic People‚Äôs Republic of Korea might not be very democratic\n\nMy point was that labelling a thing as \"X\" does not necessarily make it \"X\", and so arguing as if it is becomes a strawman argument.\n\nIt‚Äôs because communism doesn‚Äôt take into account human nature and incentives. Socialism works because it allows for human nature. Some people want to be top dog and they‚Äôll work harder for it. In communism they say there is no top dog and when psychopaths make it to the top of a system and start abusing that power they shut down any criticism of it. In socialism that same psychopath gets start a company and make a lot money and be at the top but the government just goes ‚Äúcool‚Äù we are taking 45% of that wealth and spreading across the less fortunate. Communism is every gets the same (which could never actually work no matter how altruistic the government because perfection doesn‚Äôt exist) and socialism is to each according to their needs (meaning as a society we got you, you aren‚Äôt gonna fall off the cliff, what you choose to do beyond that is up to you)\n\nCommunism isn't where everyone gets the same, you literally quote Marx on how a communist society distributes it's resources (to each according to need). The principle of distribution in socialist society is \"to each according to his contribution\" - i.e. the worker gets the full product of their labour through the elimination of the capitalist class accruing profits on their labour.\n\nNo society is even close to distributing their resources in this lower form, let alone \"to each what they need\". This doesn't just mean that everyone gets the bare necessities for life and then they are left alone to earn what they can on top of that, it means that they receive enough for a good life as perceived by the general populace. It wouldn't make sense to require \"from each according to their ability\" and then only give the bare minimum. It feels like these ideas are purposefully poorly taught so the general population has false ideas as to what these ideologies are really about.\n\nAnd America claims to be a democracy despite being an oligarchy. You need to brush up on your information. It‚Äôs extremely dated.\n\nI‚Äôm not American, tho\n\nNever said you were\n\nI mean, it is. There are only four others\n\nPoor people have been exploited throughout history. It's happened under every form of government and economic system. Capitalism has nothing to do with it.\n\nDo you know how much money they give to the \"poor\" as you call them in Shanghai?\n\n\nThey get more money than they can spend in a lifetime.\n\n\nStop feeding your imagination. They may get 5-10 million RMB ($700,000-$1.4 million) for their dilapidated properties.\n\nthey moved to the middle of nowhere for a life of fortune. Literally the best thing that can hapoened to a person is that your old buildings getting torn down to build new apartment buildings. You get a more than a million dollars of cash or a few apartments from the government/real estate developers. You mobe to the suburbs yes but as the city develop amd expand the suburb are really nice and each apartment is worth a million dollars.\n\n[deleted]\n\nPeople who lived in the same community will be moved to the same neighborhood. And they have options now with millions or dollars. They can rent or buy an apartment building nearby if they don't want to move, instead of staying at those old ass, mostly one story houses built half a century ago. They can rent and never have to work a day in their life, or star a business or whatever  I don't know if you have gone back to Shanghai, but those middle of nowhere is good as fuck now, and it has been very nice since about 2010. FYI, there's more than 25 million people in Shanghai. There's no ghost town, there's no place where there's few people around you.\n\n[removed]\n\nOver 20 million a year helps\n\nYeah then you have tevez who went there just to play golf lol\n\nHe did that for a bit in the Premier League as well TBF, the man loves his golf.\n\nReportedly the 6th highest paid player in the world this year.\n\nYou're absolutely right about that. He won as far as I'm concerned. He can even still go to Saudi Arabia and earn more if he wanted.¬†\n\nProbably wasn‚Äôt going to make nearly ¬£200m in the last 8 years elsewhere tbf\n\nAye, he took the money and continued to take the money.\n\nHow much?\n\nYeah but he was too good to go and too young.\n\nhe definitely took the money\n\nWhy do you think the foreign players are in England? A desperate desire to move from their hometown, title contending clubs to go play midtable football in the rain? Lol.\n\nYeah to help his family - he's been pretty transparent with his intentions\n\nBelieve it or not, people from south america and africa don't travel half way around the world because they simply love playing football in europe and england.\n\nI thought it's always been their dream\n\nHe is still 33? Oh mine.\n\n[removed]\n\nMaybe Manchester United for 300k/week retirement fund\n\nNow let's not be too hasty here, he could do a serviceable job and get himself a nice 5 year deal. Then we'd cancel it at the end of the season and pay him out because he doesn't agree with Sir Jims decision to play through the end of season break to keep bringing in gate receipts.\n\nYeah let‚Äôs sign him. We‚Äôll sell Trashford, so now we can get a new old retirement ready has-been player, pay him 300K a week. Typical United fashion.\n\nHe‚Äôd unironically be a top 3 player on United at this point. And that‚Äôs having not seen Oscar play for like 6 years.\n\ndelete this pls\n\nHahahahah share the pain brothaaaa\n\nMLS is where players go to retire just saying.\n\nMLS\n\nYou read my mind. Cristiano Ronaldo was even older than him when he went to Saudi Arabia. So, Oscar still have a good chance to play there.¬†\n\nRonaldo was 33 when he scored that hattrick against Spain in the Wc, he should not be the benchmark lmao\n\nNo. Oh-Scar‚Ä¶\n\n8 years???? Is that all??? Seems so much longer.\n\nHe could get around atleast 50m if he goes to saudi. Immense talent for chelsea he was my fav player of that 2nd mourinho era and definitely still able to command good money to leagues outside of europe top 5.\n\nThat champions league goal against Juventus was insane\n\nAbsolutely took Pirlo to the cleaners\n\nI saw it live on tv too, to me still the best goal scored I ever seen. Tainted a bit cause we end up drawing that game tho lmao.\n\nI was in the Matthew Harding. Couldn‚Äôt believe what he‚Äôd done\n\nI dont know about that. Outside Toney and Diaby (neither of which were crazy expensive), the Saudi league has really chilled out on its purchases. Cancelo, 3 years younger and coming from city, is allegedly only getting 15 a year. The transfer fee was 21 million. \n\nOscar is 33 and coming off 8 years in a league very few care about. He doesn't have the star power he used to have. I'm not sure he's able to command the salary a bigger or younger star could.\n\nagree, he doesnt fall in the marquee player category with Ronaldo/Benzema/Neymar nor even the levels of Laporte/Koulibaly. He's fit more in the same class as the likes of Anderson Talisca, who's earning ~¬£100k/week. \n\nBut he did make ~¬£365k/week in China, so he'd probably be better off finding other opportunities in Brazil/Europe/MLS\n\n‚Äúraked in a staggering ¬£175m in wages over the last eight years.‚Äù\n\nholy moly that is generational wealth.\n\nOr 5 nights in Macau\n\nOr two grocery trips\n\nOr half a dentist office visit\n\nStill seems a shame to me. He could have probably earnt ¬£250k a week in England during that time. That would still be ¬£100m and he maybe would‚Äôve had a bigger presence with brand deals etc. \n\nIt just seems a waste of a career somewhat.\n\nYou are probably too young but he made a pretty straightforward statement about not caring at all about it. His priority was his family and wealth, football was just a job and moving to china was the efficient way to do it.\n\nI remember that now you mention it. It always seems a shame whenever those footballers pop up. Stephen Ireland and Assou-Ekoto if I remember rightly we‚Äôre like that. \n\nI get that it‚Äôs a job but none of us even in our lower paid jobs can do it easily if you can‚Äôt find any joy in the work.\n\nContracts have to be paid out. If he stayed at Chelsea he would of been on a shorter deal and less pay. Who knows one one hand he dominates and has an amazing career on the other he snaps his leg and his careers over. He took the safe move\n\nI know. It‚Äôs the difference between the romance of the game and the business of the game.\n\nDefinitely was the correct decision for his goals at the time, but in hindsight, imagine if he stuck around and had a few more successful years in Europe/England. He could have easily eclipsed his total earnings with how the Saudis are paying these days.\n\nOscar was earning 20M, which was 400k at Chelsea, being part of the best paid at just 22. \nSalah is same age and apparently earning 50M‚Ç¨ yearly so he might have had a chance. Id say thats the best case tho and I dont think anyone besides ManCity could pay anything near that and they pay KDB 39M. So he would need to be amongst the best of the world still today to get there.\n\n\nEven if injured, he wouldn‚Äôt have needed much to get back on level for the Chinese league.\n\nI'm thinking more along the lines like he has a few more successful years with Chelsea then transfers to the Saudi league and makes like 50-100mil a year there. He wasnt Neymar but he had potential to be a top Brazilian star which comes with massive marketing potential.\n\nStrong disagree. 75m is ALOT of money. People have different goals with their football career some want glory some just want to feed their families for generations. Both are fine.\n\nMost millionaires squander their wealth within 2-3 generations so it‚Äôs possible it would be for nothing down the line. Besides after $10-20m what difference would it really make.\n\nWhen Harry Kane scored that insane goal against him from absolutely nothing against Oscar in 2015, his decision was made.\n\nStick it all in that hawk tuah coin and he'll be a billionaire!\n\n[removed]\n\nDestroying the league in a good way, or bad way?\n\nIn a good way. In 248 games in China he scored 77 times and got 141 assists. This season alone in 40 played games he banked 31 assists and 16 goals.\n\n218 g/a in 248 games not too shabby at all we can say the money was a big factor in him leaving but can‚Äôt say he wasnt still balling over there\n\n[deleted]\n\nHe isn‚Äôt a striker. He plays number 10. So yes\n\n[deleted]\n\nHave you seen Oscar play for Chelsea and Brazil?\n\nGenuinely asking as Oscar was pretty well known before his move to China.\n\n14 goals, 20 assists in 29 games.\n\nContributing to over a goal a game. Some might say that's pretty good for a guy in his thirties.\n\nAh, so he's leaving because they can't afford his ridiculous wage anymore, and he's crying about it? Jeez.\n\nIt's not that they can't afford him, they can and they have. The way the salary cap was implemented, already signed contracts were exempt until they were up for renewal, so he renewed right before the cap went into effect to maximize is time in the league. Now that contract has expired so any further renewals would be within the salary cap, so he's leaving. It's as simple as that.¬†\n\nHe spent 8 years there, experienced great success, he loves it there, they love him there and want to keep him... the salary cap is preventing that from continuing. It's completely reasonable to be sad about leaving. How much money he made doesn't change that.\n\nOscar! My legend for Shanghai Port too! (in FM of course üòâ)\n\nLiving in Shanghai and have played 7 a side regularly down the years. Oscar was regularly seen out ‚Äúcoaching‚Äù a 7 a side team of Brazilian lads in a purely for fun weekend league with regular guys. Seems he really enjoyed his time here and could live a really good relaxed life outside of football.\n\nIt's mad to think how good he was in a Chelsea team that was stacked with 10s and wide attacking midfielders.\nHe could have stayed in Europe, played top level football and still made a hell of a lot of money. Probably not near what he earned in China but still enough to make everyone you know financially comfortable for life now and when he is no longer in this world.\n\nMaybe in hindsight, he could have stayed in Europe, had more acclaim playing in higher level tournaments, receiving more international success and then made just as much money going to Saudi for the twilight of his career.\n\nRespect the honesty and that he stuck it out so long and integrated in the league rather than just popping over for a few years and then jumping back but it's still a bit of a wasted career for me\n\nIt's a football career, sure, but it's also the guys life. Maybe he had a sense of adventure and wanted to experience something new/unique. Or perhaps he wanted to raise his young kids while working in a less pressured environment.\n\nSeriously. I'm not going to fault a guy for taking a job that gives him an exciting new life experience, pays him way more, and is way less stressful. I'd take that offer too. I don't care if he was allegedly making 7 million at Chelsea. When someone offers you a less stressful job for triple the pay, it's not weird to take it.\n\nIm pretty sure he said he also didn‚Äôt want to compromise his body by playing elite level all his career.\n\nAll true but that's also a lot of \"coulds\", plenty of players have gone down hill or not fully made it - he was made an offer he couldn't refuse and stuck it out and seemingly loved it. Maybe he'd have become a top star in Europe and made evn more in the long term through sponsorship etc or maybe he'd have become largely forgotten but I doubt he has any regrets as this seems to have worked out so well for him\n\nWether he has regrets or not, he still managed to make a very well paying career out of what many here consider a hobby. \nYou have guys paying weekly subs to play Sunday league football in boggy fields, taking turns to wash the kit and Oscar is living a good life.\n\nI don't begrudge him doing it and in typical employment, people chase the money over a career and reputation at times so why shouldn't he.\n\nThe other way of looking at it is that Kevin De Bruyne was at Chelsea at a fairly similar time, also stuck behind players who were a few years ahead of him and he took a different option\n\nAgreed overall but KDB is a little different of a situation. Oscar started his pro career at Chelsea. In his 4 seasons there before his 5th where he sold halfway through the season, he had 122 appearances in the prem. 94 of them were starts. That's 30.5 appearances out of 38!044 season. \n\nKDB was signed by Chelsea, couldn't fit him in and loaned him out. Gave him half a season where he made 3 PL appearances, and then loaned him out again, then selling him. We're talking 131 (9 in his last half season) PL appearances vs 3.\n\nDoesn't even seem like he 'stuck it out' honestly, seems like he actually really enjoyed himself and the fans enjoyed him\n\nDo we think any one in Saudi league will have this kind of connection? it‚Äôs ridiculous money, plastic fans and actively blocking out  all the bad shit Saudi does\n\nRonaldo will keep playing there as long as his body allows him. And he already seems very happy to not give a crap about anything other than football.\n\nYeah maybe he will come down under when he‚Äôs 50 xD\n\nHonestly? He can be Portugal's King Kazu if he ever so wishes.\n\nGenerational wonder like him might be able to actually stay fit and skillful enough to play even to his late 50s in smaller leagues.\n\nHonestly, I think at some point in the Real Madrid years he switched to caring about fame and legacy, wiht football as a way to achieve that.\n\nI mean, I'm not sure he even gives a crap about the football, just scoring goals to add to his tally. If his team never win anything but he gets to 1000 goals, he'll be delighted (which is one of the main reasons he's in Saudi)\n\nI can't believe you make me defend the guy, but he very clearly does care about the game still\n\nThat‚Äôs a fantastic career. Won a league titles; played for his country and then used his talent to make a shit ton of cash. Most of us are trying to maximise pay via our skill, he has also managed to do some legendary stuff as well. Good luck to him.\n\nIts rare to see a player move to a small league purely for money and continue to play at a \"high\" level or at a level which was expected of them. It seems like most players move for money but then lose all the motivation, treat it like a retirement plan which then ultimately ends in a contract termination.\n\nI havent heard that name since he left for China. China was supposed to be an up and coming league, like Saudi is trying to do.  Never panned out, much like Saudi won't pan out\n\nThink he gets overlooked by the majority because of how brief his time are Chelsea was, but there was a small window where he looked like a top, top player. \n\nGather he's used his immense earnings to try and improve things back home as well. Good for him.\n\nMoved to China to make the big bucks at age 25. NGL I would too. He doesn't have to ever work again.\n\nNow they go to Saudi Arabia, these murderers pay even more\n\n[deleted]\n\nHistory is history. How many people have they beheaded this year?\n\nI love how somethings which happened hundreds of years ago means someone from the same country today can't have an opinion about something.\n\nYeah, you currently we don't kill journalists or gay people, we don't enslave migrants.... I daresay it kinda makes a difference, but what do I know, we had empire\n\nWell. Looks like you are polish the same as me. Just remind me when we have been the empire. BTW surely he means more recent times and he is got point.\n\ni remember watching him play for brazil u21s. thought he was gonna be world class but ig not üò¢\n\nOne can be world-class and just not play in Europe.\n\nOne can, but trying to become elite when you're not testing yourself regularly against elite opponents is doing it on hard mode. There's a reason Brazil haven't called him up in nine years.\n\nI agree with you for the most part, but Brazil hasn't exactly been performing for those nine years so its not like you can say that they know exactly what they're doing.\n\nYet despite those struggles, they still never bothered to even try him.\n\nThats one way of looking at it, or you could also say that a big reason they struggled was because of not choosing the right players. There haven't been many times Brazil was short of attackers/attacking midfielders.\n\nHe was amazing in the 2014 WC. I thought he would be next in line after Neymar.\n\nCan you imagine this kind of title for de Bruyne or Salah?\nX leavs y after 8 years, earning ¬£¬£¬£.\n\nIt is insulting and disrespectful.\n\nOscar went there solely for the money, and would have left 2 years ago in Shanghai had allowed his transfer to Flamenco, money is the measure of his 'success' in China.\n\nGreat FIFA 15 player for my UT\n\nOnly been 8 years? Holy fuck feels like way longer ago\n\nGood for him.\n\nWestern media can‚Äôt fathom that someone would actually enjoy China so they have to say he only enjoyed it because of the insane amount of money he made\n\nThe money definitely helped..\n\n\nWhen you have a collection of players who went to China on big wages and the majority returned within 2 years, money has a way of papering over cracks when it comes to playing football somewhere.\n\n\nNeed only look at the Saudi league, lot of big name players have gone there with only a couple returning.\n\nHes the local Favorite. What a man, respect\n\nWhat happened to him? I remember he was supposed to be the next big thing for Brazil football &amp; Chelsea and then just took off to China.\n\nMoney. He comes from a poor family and wanted to maximize his earnings.\n\nSure he was struggling at Chelsea wasn‚Äôt he\n\nIt's been a while, i think he had some injuries which hurt his form and then Chelsea wanted to moved on.\n\nwe didn't want him to move on he was just on less money here than he was at china he was open about his leaving for his family\n\nIf only there was an easy to find article explaining exactly what happened to him.\n\nHe went to China for eight years\n\nWhere is he going next? Any chance a top 5 league can gamble on him?\n\nAlmost certainly home to Brazil.¬†\n\nLet's just say it moved me TO A BIGGER HOUSE\n\nBro proably made like a Billion no joke. \n\nKind of respect it, leaves in his prime to make sure the next couple generations of family live like royalty.\n\nI too would cry if I were leaving on 400k a week job\n\nMy favourite current player, I was gutted when he left England as I knew access to see him regularly would be limited.\nHe was honest about his motivations and although he gave up any sort of International career he is still respected as a great player and a great professional.\n\n¬£175 million in wages. Saved you a click\n\nHe maxed out earnings and gets the adulation other players can only dream of. It's a legit good career. Well played Oscar!\n\nCrying that he's not making ridiculous bag anymore.\n\nI remember the fuss when he went there, fair play to him for sticking it out for so long.\n\nQ\n\nthat‚Äôs a lot of money.\n\nOscar knew exactly what he wanted and went for it. He's a very happy man with his decision and now a lot of money.¬†\n\nVolta pro meu colorado por favorrr\n\nThe Chinese fans are quality to be fair, very loud\n\nHe completed his contract and the club is trying to extend him.\nHowever, due to the newly set salary cap, he may have to take a pay cut, and it's not certain if he'll be able to take it (he could leave and take it, too, which wouldn't be surprising)\n\nSaudi Arabia probably next, no? If he's just chasing the cash, then he needs to follow the money.\n\nWould you turn down a company that offered you 3x your salary?\n\nOscar was class at Chelsea. Never quite took the leap to the next level. I'm happy his unusual move to China worked for him\n\nI‚Äôd cry too if I wasn‚Äôt earning that any more\n\nWho?\n\nGood for him, bro got paid\n\nSo much wasted talent. Just for a pay day. That goal vs juventus was different.\n\nDoes nobody know this dude's surname?\n\n[deleted]\n\nWell, it isn't a news website so I don't know what you expect?\n\nYou could've posted it 2 days ago if you were that worried\n\nSlow sports news *\n\nTo the rest of the world his impact was no greater than Tevez's¬†\n\nDid he dry his tears with paper money???\n\nHe spent basically 80% of his professional career there so his tears are somewhat justified\n\nNot when he's only leaving because they can't afford to keep paying him that anymore.\n\nIf anything it's a bit disrespectful..\n\nHe could've chosen to leave years ago but didn't, shows he genuinely liked the club. Just because the league is based in a non white country doesn't mean you have to shit on it.\n\nHas he turned down moves to bigger clubs on better money?\n\nBecause the man was quoted as saying \"China has incredible financial power and sometimes makes offers that players can't refuse\".  That doesn't sound like somebody in it for love of the league.\n\nAnd I don't think it's anything to do with Sinophobia, I find it hard to believe he's motivated by non-fiscal reasons in the same way that I find it hard to believe any of the Man City or Liverpool players are motivated by their passion for living in the cold, dreary north of England.\n\nWasn't that when he moved? If it was, in 8 years he had more than enough time to gain an emotional attachment to the club. In fact, his latest statements on China are very positive. He says great things about the country and its people.\n\nI imagine you are just as upset when midtable English teams buy star players from CL clubs from less rich leagues\n\nI'm not particularly upset, just cynical.  And I think you missed the last sentence of my comment.\n\nI wondered what had happened to him. Last time\nI saw him play he was in tears too‚Ä¶.\n\nI'd always take the US over China or Saudi Arabia even with all the huge sums of money that these 2 offer.\n\nYour opinion, person. But personally I think it's dumb AF to think this.\n\nDon't know many decent players who have followed that same idea (Inter Miami aside), Saudi's stacked whilst the America leagues simply aren't.\n\nI would also cry if I was a washed up former star player that won't receive another offer for even 20% of the wages I had in China.\n\nHe'd get more in Saudi."

Him and Ramos both.\n\nI can still remember very well back in the days when he played with Ramos against Bayern Munich in UCL. They both came up again Ribbery who decided to save his life because Pepe and Ramos was going for the k√¨ƒæl and not the ball.¬†\n\nWhat?\n\n[deleted]\n\neyyyy\n\nFinally! Now I can approach him for my 35+ Wednesday evening 7v7 team...\n\n*No slide tackles allowed in the league*\n\n\nPepe: no thanks\n\n2028 Olympics: Pepe wins Gold medal in Taekwondo\n\nNothing *explicitly* in the rules that says that you can‚Äôt hit an opponent with your car though?\n\n‚ÄúHow are you calling that a slide tackle ref, that tackle was ALL ANKLE! The contact with the ground afterwards was incidental!‚Äù\n\nThis guy made Sergio Ramos look like the good guy\n\nHahaha for real, he was brutal. But hot damn he was amazing.\n\nAmazing? He was high spirited but a dirty cunt who looked to injure others. Always played dirty to cover up his lack of talent to make clean tackles. \n\nWatch Classic Italian defenders, they were amazing.\n\nYou don‚Äôt play that long been talentless. You sound stypd\n\nPepe was a dirty &amp; great player. Van Gogh was also a dirty &amp; great painter :) \n\nDon‚Äôt mix up 2 different things.\n\nVan Gogh had a good slide tackle (and an excellent header) but had a habit of not following half of his keeper‚Äôs shouts.\n\nVan Gogh: ‚ÄúI look at the computer, the computer say gigacocka said: ‚Äòfuck Pepe, fuck van Gogh‚Äô and I‚Äôm like what he say fuck me for?‚Äù\n\nMan stfup lmao,u only watch clip of him being menace while the guy have changed a lot on his long ass career\n\nPepe x Ramos pairing was fascinating when they played for Real Madrid.¬†\n\nThey dominating Bayern in 13/14 was a sight to be behold\n\nThat's true, lol. He was never bothered about being called the bad guy.\n\nPepe had far less red cards on his career.\n\nI suspect he's the guy his ex team mates would call first if they needed someone to bail them out of jail.\n\nEx team mate:\nPepe, I would like to order a prison break\n\nPepe: I be there in 1 hour.\n\nProbably the last of his breed. An absolute wall at the back. Cracking player, great shithouse.\n\nHey hey now. Rudiger is still around\n\nPepe was what Rudiger is trying to be\n\nrudiger is a bit mental sometimes but pepe was a psycho who seemed to enjoy hurting some opponents. He couldn't survive in the var era\n\nPepe literally has been great even in the var era¬†\n\n[deleted]\n\nI could be wrong but I remember someone mentioning he said he changed his mindset coming onto the field after having his daughter lol maybe he learned to love\n\nHow can you say that when he was portugals best defender in the euros at age 41 and even has a case to be their best player,\n\nHard agree, Pepe was amazing at the euros\n\nAND he was literally MOTM in the final against France in 2016\n\nThis is such a bad take, Pepe has been playing through the var era as long as anyone else and his game remained unchanged and consistently great.\n\nHe was doing great he would only hurt the ones who hurt his teammates example Dani Alves lol also Suarez when he tried to hurt pepe he got fucked up in Return\n\nhttps://youtu.be/jKt4IBxD5oo?si=wgTx16bcdEmhuzux\n\nwas this justified?\n\nR√ºdiger is a great player. Aggressive for sure but not unsportsmanlike like Pepe was\n\nGoodnight, funny man!\n\nSeriously, Pepe was a force of nature and I'm happy he spent most of his time at Madrid. He was cut from the mold of the 90's hardman and I'm sad too see him go.\n\nHe was very unsportsmanlike in my opinion\n\nWell, Pepe has a lot of negative image but‚Ä¶ I would prefer facing Pepe rather than Materazzi.\n\nStill, players like him are part of the game.\n\nMore like the 80s\n\nStill playing at a great level too\n\nHis last game performance was amazing\n\n\"leave the football, before the football leaves you\"\n\nHe was goosed quite a bit in the Euros\n\nDirty player\n\nAmazing how this guy has been rehabilitated as some sort of wise elder gentleman of the game. He‚Äôs an absolute piece of shit filthy player who stomped on another guy‚Äôs head. Inexcusable.\n\nRight? Most people here have watched shorts or reels edits of him and now thinks he's a \"good player\". Not at all. He's a criminal\n\nright? all i could think about when reading the headline is good riddance\n\nTime heals all wounds. Also people don't really hold on to grudges especially about stuff that happened to there people. Outside of that one crazy instance Pepe has had an outstanding career and deserves his flowers.\n\nHe also headbutted Thomas M√ºller and much more. Hes extremely unsportsmanlike\n\nNah.

He tried the same shit against Zlatan when he was at Man Utd.\n\nFacts\n\nThis douchebag should have been barred from professional football after that incident in Real Madrid, where he kept kicking a man he just knocked down (just like that lunatic Suarez).\nJust think about how many young boys grew up thinking that this kind of behaviour on pitch was acceptable.\n\nPeople on here acting like he‚Äôs some kind of brute or the ‚Äúdirtiest player of all time‚Äù, he would not have stood out at all in the 90s and would have been one of the ‚Äúcleaner‚Äù players in the 70s. EVERY team had a player like him back then. Leeds had several\n\nGetafe incident make people say that and it is understandable but after that he became a bit more mentally stable\n\n[removed]\n\nThis. He was a psycho. And the fanboys are calling him a ‚Äúgreat‚Äù &amp; ‚Äúamazing‚Äù ü•≤\n\nlast of an era and the fist player to make me go what the fuck\n\nUnsportsmanlike Player all the way... wont forget the headbutt against Thomas M√ºller. How miserable must one be?\n\nViolent child who never grew up\n\nThat's what you get for feigning injury\n\nDog man fuck you\n\nI first read this as ‚ÄúPope‚Äù retries from football.\n\nWill Penaldo do the same in favor of his national team?\n\nFinally, what a piece of shit\n\nShit player, shit person. He won‚Äôt be missed \n\nGood riddance\n\n[deleted]\n\nGive your head a wobble you fool, there was at least 30 better defenders in the last 15 years. He was overrated by clowns like you who see him hurt players in highlights and think wow he must be good.\n\nNo skill, no technical ability whatsoever. Just a clown like yourself. That‚Äôs why he played mostly in Portugal and Varane replaced him\n\n[deleted]\n\nPique \n\nPuyol\n\nNesta \n\nMaldini \n\nVidic\n\nRio Ferdinand \n\nTerry \n\nCanavaro \n\nChelllini \n\nDesailly\n\nBarzagli\n\nBonucci\n\nThiago Silva \n\nLucio\n\nRamos\n\nHierro\n\nRafa Marquez\n\nVarane\n\nLillian Thuram\n\nIgor Tudor\n\nStam\n\nStones\n\nDias\n\nRudiger\n\nVan Dijk\n\nOttamendi\n\nSol Campbell \n\nJust off the top of my head\n\n\n\nPeak is always arguable when you talk about CBs because they don‚Äôt have as obvious stat indicators like strikers with goals/assists, but I can only count maybe 3-4 people who played around the same time as him and had similar career accolades and played at a consistently high level throughout their career.\n\nYou‚Äôre *really* stretching it when you say in the last 15 years because many of these guys peaked 20+ years ago. Maldini retired 15 years ago ffs, and Desailly retired 18 years ago.\n\nPepe is living proof that people like yourself think anyone who played for Madrid is an instant great. \n\nHe didn‚Äôt play at a high level throughout his career either, after Madrid didn‚Äôt want him he ended up in Portugal, the 6th or 7th best league in Europe if we‚Äôre being generous? \n\nMy point remains, he wasn‚Äôt anywhere close to the top of defenders over any period of time. He had no real talent apart from trying to injure people. Look at the tackles against Messi, against the guy from getafe. This to me is not football. And if he had played anywhere but Madrid this would‚Äôve been exposed but Madrids players never get punishment from referees.\n\nPepe, congratulations on an amazing career. That being said, you are one of the dirtiest players &amp; I fucking hate you.\n\nTrash and violent defender Who got carried the whole carrier by a team full of top players.\n\nPff what a legend he was! Thank you Pepe ü§ùü§ù\n\nDirty player, hated him.\n\nDisgusting he was allowed to even play till this day.\n\nGood\n\nI hate him and Ramos for all the violent crimes they commited on the pitch in public.\nShould've been sent to jail.\nHow can you be so unfair?\nPurposefully just trying to injure and hurt your fellow sportsmen?\n\nJust despicable.\n\nGood.\n\nPorto fan here. He's an absolute legend of the game, and as classy as they come\n\nAll the shit they say about him is all due to a few bad tackles over 10 years ago\n\nThat's not completely true. Yes, his worst years were those you mentioned, but he never became a saint.\n\nThat being said, what a legend he is. Great player, leader, and above all, with the good and bad joined, a fighter.\n\nSince when is stomping on someone‚Äôs head with your cleats considered a tackle?\n\nYou expect people to villify him over one single tackle when plenty of legends and footballers have done much worse ?\n\nlol a few bad tackles? are you sure about that? pretty sure it was more than a few\n\nAs a Be≈üikta≈ü fan, I‚Äôll never forget him, he was one of the players that brought us to the round of 16 in the champion‚Äôs league and I still have my jersey with his name on it\n\nThis guy truly has no remorse, he intentionally tried to injure so many players\n\nNice\n\ni wouldve thought this guy retiring with ronaldo. Makes sense now why he cried after getting knocked out of the euros now.\n\nPepeHands\n\nI'm still gonna wait for him to officially retire from prowrestling\n\nI thought he was a frog\n\nWas really hoping to see him in 2026 World Cup üò™\n\n[removed]\n\nA good player should play according to the game's rules and should always have a fair play. He didn't\n\nlegend. last of an era and one of the first players to make me go what the fuck\n\nI think he even got better in his late 30s in pure defending, he was rock solid. Could have played at Real Madrid till today imo, it's his late years that showed that he's world class.\n\nI misread that as ‚ÄúPope,‚Äù and was very confused\n\nWhat a beast on defense. Always on a high level\n\nThis post tackled me both feet at the ankle and the ref said play on.\n\nHaha Pepe was such a shitter but he won a lot ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\n\nGood riddance\n\nWe will miss you, PEPEü•∫\n\nA legend who worked hard for the game till the end. Thank you for all those memories.¬†\n\nNot nearly soon enough.\n\nDirtiest player to ever play.\n\nHe's a butcher. Hopefully he wont came back as a coach.\n\nThank god this dirty goblin is gone\n\nWith Jimmy Anderson retiring from test cricket, and Pepe from football I now might have to have a serious think about whether I‚Äôm going to make it as an international cricketer and/or footballer. The only thing holding me back before was my ability and fitness level, but as these two have retired it seems now its my age too. A sad, sad day for my ambitions.\n\nThe ankles of world football will greet his retirement with a gigantic sigh of relief.\n\nThe Butcher of Brazil has finally stood down.\n\nHe should have been banned from football after his aggression. I don't know how the Getafe player he attacked did not file charges.\n\nHe reminds me of my dad lol\n\nNo, actually don't\n\nPepe will always be one of us. He was strong pillar at the back of Portugal. He will be missed so much.¬†\n\nthanks man, portugal will miss him, cr7 be crying his ass\n\nOne of the greatest defenders out there\n\nThank you for all these precious moments that we cherishedüòî\n\nEven as dirty as he played back in the day, goodbye legend. You will be missed\n\nHe was a terror at RM\n\n\nHey!

Just need Sergio ramos to retire too now\n\nOne of the goats\n\nFans will remember him forever\n\nI thought Pepe was going to retire with cristiano.\n\nAbsolute legend! Watching him running down speedsters at 40 the past Eruos was insane.\n\nImagine calling this brute a legend. He was a shithouse. It's a miracle he didn't severely injure someone.\n\nSo ? Maradona was 24x7 on cocaine and literally karate kicked a player on the head and abused girls and he's still considered a legend . Pepes on the field shithousery is nothing¬†\n\nHe represented his nation with honour until the last. I salute you sir.\n\nbest defender ive seen in my life. been watching football for over 2 decades now\n\nWhat joke lol. Madrid fan? Madrid bias is quite astounding. From hearing claims like Ramos is the best CB to Modric is the greatest midfielder to this. Laughable.\n\nEven if he isn't the best of the past 20 years he's still at least on the top 10.\n\nI mean maybe. 20 year is a small sample space tbh. But you can't explain to me that you watched Maldini, Nesta, Cannavaro, Puyol, Ramos, Pique, Vidic, Ferdinand, Thiago Silva, Boateng, and said  \"Naa Pepe is the best\".\n\nI mean, I don't even know what parameters you'd use to compare something so subjective, but career-wise, Pepe won more than a lot of those guys, and he had more longevity than most, so there's that. I think comparing players always leads to broad and subjective conclusions. I don't like Pepe, and I think he's one of the best to ever do it, even if he was/is an absolute asshole. To me, he's up there with all those guys.\n\nI get not liking Pepe, but he's clearly above guys like Pique, Ferdinand, and Boateng. No sense pretending he isn't one of the greatest defenders of his generation.\n\nI mean it is highly debatable but whatever. The guy legit claimed he is the best he has seen in the last 20 years. Either he is delusional or only watched Madrid matches. Even then you wouldn't put Pepe above Ramos.\n\nramos defending wise isnt half the player pepe is. what makes ramos so popular are all his late min headers for madrid.  and ofc the fact hes spanish and won 3 international trophies in a row since people tend to overvalue those titles over 38 games trophies\n\nYeah, I'd take Ramos over him too, but it's not that insane to think Pepe is the best someone has ever seen in the last 20 years. Look at his resume. Not a lot of players can start at the biggest club in the world for as long as he did.\n\nthats highly disrespectfull. pepe carried everywhere he went to and is extremly underrated CB\n\nUsed to never like him, but looking back I realised how much I will miss him\n\nHe should be in jail\n\nGonna miss those career ending sliding tackles from behind and \"inadvertent\" elbow while fighting for the header.\n\nMean number of actual crimes committed on pitch per 90 minutes will go down significantly worldwide\n\nA tackling legend\n\nAbsolute shithead, great defender tho.\n\nReal Madrid Legend and Real Life Goon.\n\nGreat. This will make football a little bit more fair. Long live sportsmanship.\n\nThe dirtiest player. So long.\n\nFuck this bald cunt. Dirty fucking player\n\nthank you so much for everything, legend.¬†\n\nBeing a rough center back is one thing. Pepe punted an opponent in the back while he was on the ground. He could‚Äôve crippled the man. No matter how competent a player (and he was), this is something I cannot overlook. Brutish and cowardly (in a match vs Benfica 3 years ago, the much smaller Pizzi floored him; a showing of what actually happens when people stand up to him), protected by bought referees in several of his clubs, namely Real Madrid\n\n&gt;&gt;stand up to him), protected by bought referees in several of his clubs, namely Real Madrid\n\n\nThis is the only copium Barca fans are living on since their club and reality is now dog shit. Keep telling yourself that¬†\n\nI am not a Bar√ßa fan. However, had he played for them or literally any other club when he did that to Casquero, he‚Äôd have gotten at least triple the suspension- or worse. This much is evident\n\nDirtiest player of all time? Goodbye.\n\nMaybe if you‚Äôre 12\n\nThis is one of the New football ‚Äúfans‚Äù that only see tiktoks and base their entire knowledge on them\n\nNope, he‚Äôs the dirtiest player of all time.\n\nShould have been banned for life already after he hit and tortured multiply players in that one game.\n\nShould have been banned from football years ago\n\nThe Joe Biden of football\n\nPepe - The Legend. He pulled off a great performance in the Euro 2024 tournament. Happy retirement Pepe.¬†\n\nWhat a legend, what a career he had.\nI would never forget that EURO 16 finals performance.\n\nDamn what a Rookie. Definitely gone too soon üòî\n\nPepe did everything to get Ronaldo to final of Euros but he can‚Äôt do everything by himself üòî\n\nSad news, I bet he still has another 2 seasons left in the tank, he could even still make the WC.\n\n\n\n\nWe need people like him, so we can point our fuckin' fingers and say, \"That's the bad guy.\"\n\nWill miss the most iconic character in the memes\n\nDamn, I'm seeing Porto in late August and was hoping to see him out one last time.\n\nLong time Barca fan here - as much as I hated some of his antics against my team - there is no question that the guy is an absolute legend. Enjoy retirement, Kepler Lima.\n\nBreak some legs off the pitch now champion\n\nOn behalf of Real Madrid fans and indeed the entire football fraternity, we are grateful for the wonderful moments you have shared throughout your football career. In your time, there has been no dearth of passion, dedication, and commitment to excellence in Real Madrid. You were a rock in our defense, a leader on the field and have managed to be an inspiration to quite a number of fans across the world.\n\nYour contributions have won us a galore of victories: three La Liga championships, three UEFA Champions League titles, among others. Your fierce defense and never-say-die attitude in the face of defeat have seen you rise to occasions whenever it was most needed. Thank you for the memories, the trophies, and the beautiful football you showered upon us for all these years.\n\nA legend passes into history, a new look lies ahead, full of joy and expectation. Amazing Arda G√ºller comes into the place of Pepe, who he will fulfill. With this super extra special talent, vision, and flair, the destiny of G√ºller is to overshadow even the very best football greats, not excluding Maradona.\n\nMany critics say that the best time in Arda's G√ºller run has passed. But potential is not simply findable. Skilled in dribbling and faultless in playmaking, ever sharp-eyed toward the net, he already gave hints of what was on tap. And we are firmly convinced that Real Madrid under G√ºller will go to heights about which nobody ever heard: e.g., win seven triples in a row and be rated absolutely the greatest of all time without any contest.\n\nThe best days are before Real Madrid, and we can't wait to see what kind of epic journey a life with Arda G√ºller at the helm takes us on. Here's to new beginnings, success unlike any other, and a long, rich legacy.\n\nWas this coming? Feels sudden considering he was still playing at a high level.\n\nNever heard of him but he must have been pretty good"

The Normans who invaded in 1066 had lived in France all their lives, and so had their parents and grandparents.\n\nNo, Normans.\n\nOnly when they lost\n\nWell... what are French if not stuck up Germans?\n\nFair\n\nEven the pun is inaccurate\n\nThe irony\n\nAberdeen were the last team to beat them in a European final in 1983 üôÇ\n\nWith SAF?\n\nYep, he beat Bayern on the way too. Then Hamburg next year in supercup\n\nAnd People think SAF wouldn't adapt to take on Pep and Klopp if he was still managing today.\n\nHe would be fine. He won his last PL with welbeck and cleverly kicking and screaming with about 8 games to spare.\n\nObviously he's about 83 now so would be unfair to drop him back in, but enjoy his retirement.\n\nGiven his attendance record at Old Trafford, he's hardly enjoying it.\n\nGod, that's a thought, ain't it? Imagine building a club to such a high standing, dreaming of the days you'll watch the games peacefully as a spectator, living out the last of yours years only for the team to be such a disappointment with no real upturn in sight.\n\nHahah true, we only know pain now\n\nReminds me of this scene from band of brothers about the battle of Bastogne. Major winters handed over command of easy company. But when he saw how lousy foxhole dike is during the invasion, he wanted to rush out but was stopped by colonel sink\n\nTo be fair on cleverly. He was good under fergie until he broke his ankle against Bolton. Him and Anderson turned the game around against Man City when we were losing 2-0 in the charity shield\n\nThat's a fair comment. He's not shit, but you wouldn't associate him as a regular title winner, like Keane, Scholes, Giggs. \n\nI recall a run of games with Anderson where they had loads of energy and were looking good but sadly didn't last.\n\nSo overlooked at Aberdeen. He‚Äôs the last non-rangers/celtics to win the league title. And he did it thrice with Aberdeen.\n\nThrice you say !? By god\n\nYes\n\nYeah, but before he got the S in his name.\n\nHis first name isn't sir?/s\n\nYup\n\nSAF made a Scottish team to be actually good\n\nü´°üè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å≥Û†Å£Û†Å¥Û†Åø\n\n'Aberdeen are a team that money can't buy - a soul, a team spirit built in family tradition' - Alfredo Di Stefano\n\nAtletico beat them in the 2018 European Supercup\n\nSshhhh, give us this. üòÇ\n\nAllow me to move the goalposts slightly and say the Supercup isn't a final as there isn't a tournament preceding it, though it is obviously a significant trophy (I'm not going dismiss it as Aberdeen also won it and we hold that above the rest of Scottish football as the only club to win two European trophies).\n\nNah, they then lost 3 European Supercup against Chelsea (0-1 in 1998), Galatasaray (1-2 in 2000) and Atl√©tico de Madrid (2-4 in 2018). If you include world titles, they also lost an Intercontinental Cup to Boca Juniors (1-2 in 2000).\n\nWe don't talk about those, shhh. Also not technically finals as there aren't tournaments preceding them in the traditional sense right? No one says \"the final of the European Supercup\", plus it's just better to say Aberdeen üòÇ\n\nInterestingly, the Liverpool team who beat Real in the European cup final of 1981 (which is what this is about) had also beat Sir Alex‚Äô Aberdeen 1-0, 4-0 in the round of 16 that same year.\n\nGot it. What Dortmund need is Kenny Dalglish, Ian Rush and Graeme Souness.\n\nI actually really liked that Liverpool team under Kenny Dalglish. They were a joy to watch at times.\n\nBob Paisley was the manager at the time\n\nKenny wasn't managed for another 4 or 5 years I don't think. Paisley was manager when we beat Real in 81 then we had Joe Fagan after Bob, then Kenny.\n\nThey are one of the greatest club teams of all time yeah lol - top 10 for sure.\n\ndont forget Alan Kennedy\n\nBarney Rubble*\n\nLuton Town hasn't lost a UEFA champions league final for more than 100 years.\n\nlol my club have never lost an UCL match in its entire history.\n\nOoh, here‚Äôs one.. can anyone name a side that qualified for European competition (European cup / UEFA cup/ cup winners cup as it was, UCL/UEL/etc) and were undefeated ? I‚Äôll name one.. Luton Town: English clubs got banned so Luton was one of a handful of teams that qualified but weren‚Äôt allowed to compete because of the heysel ban so undefeated :-p\n\nThat's crazy. India also qualified for the WC but never lost a WC match.\n\nOoh! Do go on.. I don‚Äôt recall India ever qualifying.. which year was it and what happened? Did they withdraw or something?\n\n1950, yeah withdraw because FA prioritised Olympics first (as it was bigger than Fifa wc that time)\n\nWow! Crazy.. I know the World Cup was small fry back then, I once read Scotland refused to go to some world cups, also England in the early ones.. maybe a Scottish Redditor could help me out, was it something about not going if they didn‚Äôt win the home championship, which was a qualifier back then..\n\nyeah that was the case for scotland\n\nTosno FC. They won the Russian Cup, getting qualification to the Europa League, and then ceased to exist at the end of the season.\n\nOh wow! Did they go bankrupt or was it a merger?\n\nThey went bankrupt. Their last season also had them relegated from the top flight, as they only got 1 point in the last 9 games.\n\nI thought Luton Town never won a UCL Final\n\nObligatory \"nor have Forest\". We're equal top with Porto with most European Cup/Champions League finals without losing any (only 6 clubs have 100% winning record in finals).\n\nIn terms of European cup finals featuring RM only Inter , Benfica and Liverpool have beaten them . So I don't know of those clubs shoud be part of an exclusive club or something .\n\nYou forgot Aberdeen\n\nHe missed the Capital C in ‚ÄúEuropean Cup‚Äù, Aberdeen didn‚Äôt beat Madrid in the final of the European Cup like the 3 teams mentioned. \n\nChelsea also beat Madrid in CWC, like Aberdeen.\n\nChelsea beat Madrid in the Super Cup, after they beat Stuttgart in the CWC and Madrid beat Juventus in the Champions League.\n\nChelsea beat Madrid in 1971 Cup Winners Cup final.\n\nMy apologies, I thought you were mixing up 98. Egg on my face.\n\nGalatasaray have also beaten Real Madrid in 2000 super cup, if it is considered a final.\n\nRandom fact: Current Galatasaray coach, Okan Buruk was selected man of the match that day.\n\nThis is why Lewandowski's 4 goals against Madrid in the semi will go down as the best ever individual performance in a big game, nothing else ever come close, not against this level this plot armor and dark magic.\n\nThat was still cursed Real Madrid that hadn't won the CL for more than a decade tho\n\nThat Madrid in 2013 is incomparable to nowadays current RM. And they didn‚Äôt have the plot armor that thick back then\n\nThat team beat Barca to 100 points and had lightning quick counter attacks. Benzema himself said that was the best team ever. I personally think only 2017 team was better. The current team is not as good, but may have more plot armor.\n\nNope, Real got their 100 points a season earlier. In 2012/13, they were beaten by Tito Vlianova's Barca for rhe La Liga title.\n\nNot as good yet\n\nThe current team could finish with 99 points, but a lot of factors go into that, back then Barca and Valencia were much stronger and now Girona and Atleti are more powerful than before.\n\nCristiano against spain. Scored 3 goals basically alone.\n\nGroup stage\n\nLast person to do it was Sir Alex Ferguson with Aberdeen.\n\nThey were the last to beat them in a European final but it wasn‚Äôt this competition\n\nThat wasn't the champions league....\n\nThe last person to do it was Bob Paisley with Liverpool\n\nUntil I read this I was like \"ah yes 43 years, since the 60s with de Stefano and co\". But that Liverpool team wasn't the 60...oh.\n\nYeah i remember now. I got confused a bit\n\nwhich also wasn't the champions league\n\nI mean, if we are honest, 2021/22 when Madrid won it they would not have even qualified for the old champions cup, nor would they in 2015/16 or 2016/17\n\n3 of Madrids \"Champions of Europe\" came when they werent even champions of spain\n\nAnd Dundee United beat Barca 4 out of 4 games in the same decade. New Firm bigger than El Classico?\n\nI will be secretly hoping Dortmund will do it but I cannot see anything but a Madrid win. Hopefully the taste of winning something will spur Bellingham on for the Euros.\n\nIt would be pretty arrogant to think it is a sure win for Real Madrid. This is one final match and the stakes are the highest. Dortmund, while not clear favorites in any of their elimination matches past PSV, reached the final with skill and have every chance of winning it. \n\nThat said, HALA MADRID!\n\nHALA VARDRID\n\nBut aren't you guys whining today because there was No VAR?\n\nThey were ALWAYS whining. \n\nDon't you remember? \"With VAR Madrid win nothing\" and here we are.\n\nNo like One Piece - Opinion Rejected‚ùå\n\nThat's not arrogance. That's providence.\n\nThat's not arrogance. That's providence.\n\nImagine Dortmund beating the titans with a Reus banger.  OMG. It'll go down as an epic moment in football history.\n\nAn amazing climax for his career.\n\nYeah, we'll just have to imagine it though.\n\nIt's Real. It's a champions league final. It's done.\n\nNottingham Forest won 100% of its Champions League/ European Cup finals\n\nPeter Taylor did a hell of a job.\n\nüò¢\n\nHey technically Celtic haven‚Äôt lost one since 1970\n\nMalm√∂ hasn't lost one since '79!\n\nI am tired of plot armor in football (except for Leverkusen's). Hope Dortmund will win.\n\n\"Germany has never been able to conquer London\" - errm didn't Germany win Euro '96 at Wembley? \n\nMay not be a club football match, but to say Germany \"has never been able to conquer London\" is factually questionable.\n\nAnd didn't germany win the last game in the old wembley stadium and the first game in the new wembley stadium? If germany knows one thing, it's how to conquer London.\n\nalso won on a club basis . 2013 ucl . bayern won in Wembley¬†\n\nThey also went to Wembley 11 years ago to an all-German final\n\nThe OP is smoking\n\nAnd they also conquered north London spanking Tottenham and Arsenal on multiple occasions\n\nLatest UCL final lost by Madrid was in 1981 vs Liverpool.\n\nI am from 1982.\n\nMy daughter born one month before the Real Madrid-Chelsea game in 2022. She's my talisman.\n\nMadridistas, you are welcome :D\n\nWembley stealing Hampden‚Äôs vibe.\n\nIt‚Äôs normally Real versus a German team in Glasgow (1960, 2002).\n\nreally wanted an all German final, but RM are defo favourites\n\nMaybe if Dortmund get Sir Alex in for one game they have a chance.\n\nBig Sam Allardyce is free at the moment.\n\nHow depressing....I don't expect this version of Dortmund to have a chance of winning but I still hope so.\n\nI wish Dortmund to win this final, but RMA will do what they do, unfortunately.\n\nNo one believed Dortmund had a chance against Juventus in 97 and they pulled it off. This will be a tough match but it's just one match. It can be done.\n\nI hope that BVB will be the one to overthrow them. Story of a underdog, like Leicester, would be an awesome one before they introduce the new \"lEaGuE sYsTeM\" and ruin Champions league once in for all\n\nThere's a first time for everything..\n\nLike Madrid winning their 15th UCL title for the first time\n\nHaha, probably more likely. Well played.\n\nAnother title for Carlo Ancelotti - the greatest manager of all time\n\nHe should have way more league titles than he does considering who he's managed for the last 25+ years.\n\nü§®\n\nü§®\n\nHopefully they don't rob Dortmund\n\nWatch them do it\n\nHopefully they don‚Äôt\n\nFranco is smiling in Hell.\n\nIt's high noon, BVB....\n\nWe won it at Wembeley\n\nWe won it in gay Paree\n\nIn -77 and -84 it was Rome!\n\nOkay, so that season everything is possible, this is the season every series breaks, so my call for the final: Real Madrid leads 1:0, but Dortmund turns it around into a 2:1, also ending the four finals in a row that ended 1:0\n\nBellingham needs this UCL. He must sun the d'or by any cost\n\nI don't think ucl will have much weight compare to Euros, and let's be honest Bellingham isn't real's best player for UCL atleast.\n\nAnd there's no way England winning Euro anytime soon\n\nso you‚Äôre saying I should bet my entire life savings on them winning?\n\nWell, they always have an important player on the pitch. The twelfth...it used to be dressed only in black, but nowadays they come in different colors, like for instance in blue, as in this semifinal against Bayern üòâüòâüòâ\n\nIf dortmund win, it would be another irony for Kane curse\n\nWest Ham haven't lost a Champions League final in over 200 years, am I meant to be impressed?\n\nAt this point we should just go ahead and rename the champions league as The Real Madrid Invitational\n\nI don't get all of this reus love lately. No one talked about reus last years and now everyone seems to be a long time fan of him.\n\nMadrid wins when they need to win, Im done betting against them and Im a Barcelona fan where most Barca fans will say anything they can to discredit the club and the team, credit is due where its due, Madrid are WINNERS when they need to win.\n\nHi everyone, I'm from Spain and I support Real Madrid. As a Real Madrid fan, I'm very glad to be in another Champions League final. I hope it will be an incredible final.\n\nNo wonder with refs like last night. That last offside call was a disgrace.\n\nWell well well, if it isn‚Äôt us against the world again.\n\nIt‚Äôs almost villainous being a Madrid fan - everyone will be praying for a Dortmund victory, except us.\n\nThis will be fun.\n\nI've got nothing against Real Madrid myself. I'm a Newcastle supporter and Dortmund were a classy team when we were in their group. They beat us twice so it would make a lot of us feel better if we lost against the Champions!\n\nEither way it's not like Real are an underdog here and people do love an underdog story.\n\nOh wow, neutrals supporting the underdog rather than the big dog that wins it all the time. What are the chances!  Poor old Real, boooo. Booooooo üòú\n\n&gt;It‚Äôs almost villainous being a Madrid fan\n\nWell, if you really feel that way, it's just as easy to hop off of the world's biggest bandwagon as it was to hop on\n\nAfter 25 years of supporting one team? Sounds like a fucking terrible idea. No thanks.\n\nplastic\n\nIn UEFA‚Äôs back pocket\n\nVarDrid\n\nHilarious.\n\nGermany may not have conquered London but Bayern treat the Gunners as their whipping boys\n\nDon‚Äôt speak like that bro we don‚Äôt play that over here\n\nLet this be organic and not have you trying to put bad juju on us . Snake\n\nBeing in the final with shameful decisions? What a disgrace to be honest .. and now Messi wins another ballon dor just to comfort him.\n\nAt least dortmund knows how to stay onside without a doubt‚Ä¶ü§™\n\nWell‚Ä¶.\n\nBayern have conquered London. In Stamford Bridge, Emirates, Tottenham, and Wembley.\n\nHopefully Marco rues will change thatü•≤\n\nDortmund will set this straight and defeat lots blancos!\n\nIt's going to be another 1-0 final. Maybe Rodrygo in the 63' minute or so. I could be very wrong but this is how they have gone for so long.\n\nLonger than the champions league has even existed\n\nFirst time for everything!\n\nNeither have I\n\nUefa have assisted them very nicely.\n\nJuventus should have a class with Real on the topic \"how to make it this far and not screw up\"\n\nI hope they lose it, but I never get my way so Madrid fans should be happy with this outcome. With the results feeling a bit poisoned after yesterday's game...hard to feel positive for them.\n\nIf only instead of Dortmund it was Bayern Leverkusen with their streak.\n\nWhat a final could have been.\n\nSo we're all Dortmund, right?\n\nIam definitely Dortmund, iam also planning to put my first bet on them as well\n\nF√ºllkrug to score anytime!\n\n3 peat madrid team would beat peps peak barca in the UCL. They would just find a way. Even this current madrid team probably would.\n\nAberdeen fan checking in üëã\n\nThis could be the year\n\nTime to lose then\n\nAnother mental stat, is no Spanish men's has lost to a non spanish opposition in a european final for over 20 years.\n\nThat's cool, but Nottingham Forest Football Club has never lost a Champions League/European Cup final.\n\nI hope Dortmund wins but everyone knows that RM is gonna throw the bank at the refs\n\nAnother in the bag  for Real ,it will be a glorious watch, the greatest international club in history win another CL. The cherry on top will be watching the antis rage and their post here, cheer lads just a few more weeks for the glory\n\nGermany DID conquer London.\n\nThey literally won the Euros here in ‚Äò96.\n\nI just want to comment that no one in Spain calls them \"Los Blancos\" and it's very weird to me to see British people do it.\n\nRooting for Reus!\n\nYou just jinxed us dude, now go knock on ü™µ and throw salt over your shoulder.\n\n&gt;I really hope Reus gets a proper goodbye\n\nHe also happens to always have a lot of bad luck, 2013 and 2014 fore example.\n\nDoesn't not qualifying count as losing it?\n\nMain protagonist: Borussia Dortmund\nFinal Villain: Real Madrid \nSecondary Villains: Atletico Madrid and PSG\nMinor Villains: PSV, AC Milan, and Newcastle\n\nCL only existed since  early 90s... so at least 30 years years :)\n\nTbh i just want RM to win the final again. If not, gg\n\nIts a team of rats that keeps getting favored in certain critical moments of a game. ramos a rat, ronaldo a rat, vini jr a rat, carvajal a rat modric a rat, camavinga a rat. gotta hate em all.\n\nDortmund area surprise for me . I did not expect them to make it to the final . \n\nThey are the underdogs in this one \n\nBest of luck to both teams\n\nReal Madrid losing a European final, lolz!\n\nThey will lose this year.\n\nThey said the same of Buffon üòè\n\nhttps://www.charitystars.com/product/two-tickets-category-1-champions-league-final\n\nTwo tickets (Cat 1) for sale which will be transferred immediately to the winner tomorrow when it closes!\n\nWell I hope they lose today for the sake of the sport.  Boring to have the same fuckers win year in and year out.  You‚Äôre basically buying a championship. European football needs a salary cap."

    "all_comment_text": "They'll get promoted,getting out of League One is hard though\n\nGetting relegated is quite easy...\n\nThey won't get relegated from league 1. But they'll be happy enough playing there for a few seasons building up the team\n\nDidn't I see somewhere they are already out spending League 1 clubs and even some championship clubs? Surely they'll be looking to get to the championship sooner rather than later.\n\nevery club looks to get promoted asap, league 1 is a ridiculously hard league to get out of though\n\nHow come? I don‚Äôt really follow anything besides the Pl and occasionally glancing at the championship table so I genuinely don‚Äôt know why it‚Äôd be harder than the others. Obviously the skill level goes up each division but anything besides that?\n\njust particularly difficult as it's a decently big step up considering the money filtering down from the championship I'd say\n\nThey spent more on transfers in their one season in the national league than we (Shrewsbury Town) have in our last 9 season we‚Äôve spent in league one. And we‚Äôre from the same area and are the bigger club by a decent margin\n\nIt's an incredibly tough league and tbh it's where a lot of their talent tops out Mullins was league one top scorer when they signed him right? Eventually they're going to meet restrictions to their spending as it starts to eat away at their income and pushes them closer to EFL financial rules. Could see them having to cut back on spending massively if they fail to get out of league one at the first or second time of asking. \n\nAs for them outspending league one clubs, I believe you're referring to their accounts posted for the promotion season from the national league, they spent something mad like 6.5 million on wages alone which outstrips some league one sides.\n\nHow do you know that?\n\n24 teams in the league. Find it very unlikely they'll be one of those with the money they have. Paul Mullin is easily league 1 standard anyway. I reckon they'll buy some of the top players from league 2 to carry up the leagues. There's usually 2 clubs from each league with financial problems and other serious problems. \n\nI reckon they'll sign Langstaff\n\nI actually think the current squad without any new signings will be enough to stay up.\n\nMullin should be upfront for Wales\n\nI'm Welsh and I've been saying that for over a year. We got no quick or sharp strikers in the squad. Brings something completely different to Moore. \n\nPage needs to get sacked ASAP\n\nBroadhead?\n\nI find him more of a winger but that's just me\n\nFair one, he is good on the wing but he‚Äôs a great finisher could definitely play the 9 and is much better than Mullin.\n\nPage is useless Giggs should come back now\n\nWhy would you want someone who assaults women as manager?\n\nMay as well get Coleman over that wet wipe.\n\nLaughable that people suggest a national league/league two player who at best has played in league one should be leading the line for wales\n\nTrue, Wales have so many good goalscorers\n\ndidn‚Äôt they explicitly say that they can‚Äôt financially sustain lagging around in any leagues as they keep trying to get promoted, though?\n\nYeah that was for National League and league 2. League 1 to the championship is much different. Staying in league 1 for a few seasons building a new squad would be ideal. \n\nCurrent squad would go straight down in the championship\n\nThat was in the lower leagues. If they get to league 1, they're entering a different pool of money and they can afford to hang around for a bit\n\nKnow nothing about the level of play between the lower leagues but imagine the higher up you are the more revenue you get. Imagine as well that to crack the championship let alone bust through to the epl you either need excellent player scouting/development or investors with deeper pockets.\n\nNo i meant the second part\n\ndidn't they try to get langstaff down in national league but he told them to fuck off? could be remembering wrong\n\nThey‚Äôll be fine in league one with a few decent recruitments. They‚Äôll get playoffs is my bet.\n\nKeegan and Al Fayed say what\n\n‚ÄòYeah‚Ä¶ it is‚Äô \n\nSincerely a Charlton Athletic fan\n\nOligarchs? No thanks!\n\nHollygarchs? Yes please!\n\nDid you hear Danny DeVito just brought Bolton.\n\nI'm all for actors buying random clubs. Zoe Saldana for Southampton üôèüèΩ\n\nmickey rourke and MK Dons\n\nThe collab I never knew I needed\n\n Not the same level of fame but one of the detectives off the wire has an obsession with Stenhousemuir\n\nYou mean downtown Clay Davis? Sheeeeeeit!\n\nI certainly do!\n\nNo that was Arnold Schwarzenegger\n\nIt's too hard to tell who's who between these two.\n\nEasy mistake to make\n\nNot Hollywood but Tom Brady and Birmingham City\n\nWhat did he bring us?\n\nPizza Cup\n\nWhere did he bring them?\n\nFuck off!\n\nYou fooled me there, I just looked it up and everything!\n\nMade me google it..\n\nWhere did he bring Bolton?\n\nIs Ryan Reynolds part of the government and ruling group of a state thats committing human rights abuses? Last I checked the worst atrocity he‚Äôs committed was R.I.P.D.\n\nNo that‚Äôs Free Guy\n\nWtf, Free Guy is a fun movie\n\nAnd here I thought it was ‚ÄúX-Men Origins: Wolverine‚Äù\n\nNah, he took care of that in Deadpool 2.\n\nWe just gonna forget about Green Lantern?\n\nThat‚Äôs far from his worst movie surely! Is the consensus that free guy was that bad? My you cousins loved it!\n\nLooked it up and it has decent enough reviews.\n\nNah mate definition of oligarch is ‚Äúricher than me‚Äù\n\nI mean, it does matter what the image of the rich guys in charge is.\n\nPlus I don‚Äôt think either of them were lacking on positive PR beforehand so it‚Äôs not like they are funnelling money into the club to try and improve their image like some of the state owned clubs.\n\nIn fact the opposite, they‚Äôre both renowned globally.\n\nAnd how they earned the money. \n\nRyan Reynolds didn't get rich by brutally maintaining control over oil fields in the nation he inherited. \n\nHe's never executed anyone for being gay.\n\nIn fact, he‚Äòs probably helped a few boys realize they were\n\ncan confirm. not me, it was andrew scott for me but i know some who saw the proposal and had to do some thinking\n\nI mean, I‚Äôve seen him turn someone into a fucking kebab multiple times\n\nIn fact, he‚Äòs probably helped a few boys realize they were\n\nIn fact, he‚Äôs probably helped a few boys realize they were\n\nIn fact, he‚Äôs probably helped a few boys realize they were\n\nAre you guys bots or just doing a thing?\n\nYou're not familiar with the [Harhay sequence?](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ)\n\nunreal\n\nAre you guys bots or just doing a thing?\n\nDidn't he used to bully Justin Trudeau, though?\n\nThat's all that matters\n\nHugh Jackman needs to buy Stockport.\n\nBro rather have someone who made his money from movies than someone who made semi-illegitamely.\n\nSo are we all ignoring the picture showing Ryan Reynolds has clearly pissed himself?\n\nYou can't fake that excitement\n\nLink?\n\nI would too\n\nThey‚Äôre calico cut pants - those pants come like that with those two little dots. They're really in style right now. Even rappers wear 'em.\n\nyou should check out the website\n\nCan i get a bit of article with my ads please @ Independent\n\nThat's my bit of article\n\nWhat a romantic underdog story. All it took was grit, determination, and buying way better players than the opposition in every league.\n\nLol isn't that how every level works?\n\nLuton would like a word.\n\nThe thing is the money Wrexham spent getting out of the national is waaaaaay beyond what it should take to win that league. The were basically spending high League 1/ low Championship level money. The financial gap between what Wrexham have spent compared to other clubs in the National League and League 2 is actually bigger by % than the gap between the top Premier league clubs and the Championship.\n\nAnd despite spending so much more money than their rivals they have only barely managed to out-perform clubs who have spent a fraction of what they have.\n\nUltimately the only people who think their ownership of Wrexham is actually a good thing are the bandwagon football hipsters who have jumped on board since their TV show started or the glory hunters at the big Premier League clubs who cannot comprehend how football works when clubs are actually forced to compete on a level playing field.\n\nI think there‚Äôs more nuance to this conversation. The real problem is the lack of consistency concerning financial fair play rules across the EFL. It‚Äôs also perfect sense to spend a ton on players that will continue to carry the club. Obviously they see Wrexham as a potential prem team in the coming years, so it only makes sense that they‚Äôd invest heavily.\n\nThey‚Äôve benefitted from going from one organised league system into another (National League, into League Two) so that‚Äôs effectively one years worth of spending that‚Äôs sort of ignored. If / when they get into the Championship there‚Äôs obviously a greater increase in tv money there to help them along. \n\nBut they‚Äôll have to fund the club at that level more because of the wages required. No idea about Wrexham‚Äôs spending during league 2 and league 1 years but if they‚Äôve been overspending to rise quickly, then it might bite them.\n\nTrue, the avg. age of the club is currently 28 so they‚Äôll need to develop their youth players and make younger signings if they intend on being sustainable. I think the culture Wrexham has developed is definitely attractive toward a prospective signing, especially if they make it to the championship. Their biggest challenge is going to be offloading older players and reducing the wage budget to accommodate more expensive signings. I don‚Äôt know anything about their youth squad either, but I‚Äôd think they‚Äôd be a major focus at this point.\n\nThey will easily attract players all the way to the Championship. Because they have such massive exposure they can provide. \n\nIn the PL it will change, but they really do want to help this town and they are going about it in a decent way. It‚Äôs not an underdog story but it is wholesome.\n\nBut will they continue to carry the club? They have bought players who at best would be low level League 1 players but have paid them Championship wages. realistically they could well be stuck paying over the odds for players who are no longer up to the job next season.\n\nPaul Mullin for example has only ever played 20 games at League 1 level for a return of 3 goals. Yet he is contracted to them for another 3 years.\n\nDefinitely depends on the player. I‚Äôm not intimately familiar with all of their signings, but Paul Mullin per your example has 11 years of experience as a professional footballer. The average age of the club right now is 28, but as time goes on I‚Äôd think they‚Äôd try to lower that number. Players like Mullin could be a valuable resource for those guys and their current crop of young talent. However, this is the ideal scenario, I could easily be proven wrong in the coming years.\n\nTheir signing process is very similar to South American, Mx clubs, in that they have some balance of older talent that can perform right now and youth talent that will develop. The reason this approach fails in South America and Mx is because those youth players almost always make moves to Europe. Wrexham doesn‚Äôt have this problem, especially if they continue to get promoted. \n\nThere‚Äôs also something to be said about the grassroots approach Wrexham has taken. Again, I‚Äôm not intimately familiar with their situation, but I‚Äôd wager their approach has built some level of dedication and loyalty among the squad, regardless of age. Older players could very possibly transition into coaching roles and they‚Äôd have a vested interest in ensuring the team‚Äôs success.\n\nMullin flopped badly last time he played at the level Wrexham are about to be promoted to and they have him on a massive expensive contract for another 3 years. He's going to become a millstone that drains their finances.\n\nuh yeah, that‚Äôs exactly how it works. they need to succeed quickly. buying better players will only get them so far, which they understand, but they aim to stagnate in the championship, not league 2.\n\nIf this is true, is it a surprise? If you do not have time to build a team, you need to get much better players than otherwise necessary to overcome the lack of team cohesion. They are also clearly targetting those higher series with the idea that once they get there, they have a core of good enough players that have already played with each other.\n\nI completely agree that football-wise, this is not rags to riches ‚Äî as symphatetic as the people of Wrexham are, the owners are cleverly using their own celebrity to pull outside money into the club, allowing them to overpower other clubs.\n\nThe thing is the fact that other clubs are matching them so closely on a fraction of their budget directly indicates that they are not actually running Wrexham well and are in fact massively overspending to achieve the results they have.\n\nWhy spend 10X what your opponents do when spending 2x would be more than adequate? Unless you are not competent enough to compete with a team you have a 2x advantage over.\n\nImagine football was motorsport, Wrexham would be the equivalent of showing up to a kart racing league in a Porsche. They could have easily smoked the opposition with a ford focus and even a semi competent driver. To need to spend that much to compete with opponents who have so much less is just indicative that the people at the wheel have no club how to drive at all.\n\nDon‚Äôt fans of Wrexham also appreciate their spell in charge? Can‚Äôt imagine Stockport fans calling them FC Hollywood bothers them all that much\n\nYes these terrible terrible owners actually caring and spending some money on the club. How disgusting. Do they have any respect for the other teams. \n\nThat's how stupid you sound\n\nSome people are just happy seeing a team that was historically screwed by a bad owner get the other side of the coin. They gambled that's for sure, if they failed to get promoted last year they would've been in so much trouble but they didn't so yeah the whole story is cool for a lot of people but I know that many others are going to hate it because they are on the receiving end they are the ones in teams that have struggled to get where they are and they feel others got it easy. But like I said new owners are a double edged sword, there are a ton of English football and in football worldwide that have suffered massively because an owner comes promises the sky a d they end up ruining the club. Also in football money has never been a given the 3 teams below wrexham in wage bill in league two aren't even in the top 6 Forrest green is there and they are at the bottom.\n\n‚Ä¶ ok. So what?  \n\nThe #1 goal of any fc is to promotion.  You do that by investing in talent.\n\nAt that level you can steamroll the leagues with a few million. With Chelsea and City they were just put on terms  to compete with the established money clubs.\n\n\"Wrexham is a smallish, provincial post industrial town that has fallen on hard times in recent years; that's why they deserve success.\"\n\nObviously this is an incredible rarity in modern Britain.\n\nWrexham was also about their 5th choice of club. The idea for the TV show came before they decided which club to buy. The \"fallen on hard times\" narrative was all tacked on afterwards to sell the show.\n\n\"fallen on hard times\" applies to 90% of towns in the UK\n\nReally? I know Rob didn't have much of an interest in football until he decided to buy the club. They certainly are much better owners than most others ,but it's not a very good story. It makes out places like Stockport and Chesterfield to be the antagonists of the series and it just doesn't sit well with me.\n\nThey are not better owners, just richer.\n\nThey have spent well beyond what they actually need to and still only barely beat their rivals. They have also put all this money into Wrexham as a loan so as soon as the TV show gets cancelled they could just turn around and demand all the money back if they wanted to,\n\nClass of 92, with peter lim, did basically the exact same thing with Salford.\n\nYou mean like how sports works? Great commentary from a butthurt fan of a rival team.\n\nButthurt? When's your 13th birthday?\n\nLol shows how old you are. 13 year olds wouldn't be caught dead using such ancient terminology.\n\nCurse you! I have been bested once again!\n\nI really don't understand what's everyone's problem with these two buying the club... Apparently the club's success is helping out the city. They've leveraged the club and outspent pretty much every other club in the league, sure. It's still a sport, doesn't necessarily guarantee you any success. Look at Chelsea. Spent don't know how many B's and look how they're performing. Also it's not like the money is coming from oligarchs that support a war criminal or even a state that simply ignores basic human rights.\n\nAnd even if they win another promotion next season, they'll probably stick to the Championship for some years before making it to the Premier.\n\nEdit: And their fame is also bringing a lot of sponsors to pump money into it\n\nProbably the fact that they‚Äôre being pushed as some sort of underdog story. It‚Äôs also quite clearly a vanity project for non-footballing people to pat themselves on the back about. I agree that it‚Äôs good for the area though, so I find it difficult to hate overall. It‚Äôs mainly the media that people have an issue with when discussing Wrexham, really.\n\nIf its a vanity project why are the owners flying back and forth to watch a fucking vanarama national league team last year?\n\nStop being so bloody pessimistic they genuinely seem buzzing about the football and Wrexham love them.\n\nMaybe they fuck off in a couple years when they get bored with Wrexham in the championship, who cares?\n\nIf I was loaded I'd do the same with my local club to be fair\n\nDon‚Äôt think it‚Äôs their local tbf\n\nYeah I don't know how they picked Wrexham in particular but i kinda understand how they want to build a club\n\nmiddle school wakeful fuzzy rock innate jobless coordinated jeans sable\n\n *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev/home)*\n\nThat I can understand but it's how they sell the story so companies sponsor the club and streaming services produce/distribute/buy the documentary. They seem quite good businessmen.\n\nIt‚Äôs evident that they are pretty good businesses, I agree. But regardless of that, you‚Äôre always left with a bit of a sour taste when you‚Äôve got clubs struggling to maintain their existence just to compete with the likes of Wrexham. Sporting integrity doesn‚Äôt exist for at least a season (until they get promoted) so everyone else either sits around getting pumped 5-0 every week, with fans losing interest and being left frustrated, or try to compete and risk financial instability.\n\nIt's also people that obviously don't support clubs in lower leagues or know anything about them that are usually the ones telling you \"nah Wrexham is a great story\", it really isnt, they're spending the same as clubs in the championship and getting put on Sky all the time because of it.\n\nAt least Wrexham are a proper club I suppose, don't get me started on Salford.\n\nYou‚Äôre dead on, on all accounts. I‚Äôve never debated this topic with lower league fans because we all seem to agree what Wrexham have done, at least from a sporting perspective, is not good. \n\nLike you say, at least people actually support Wrexham though.\n\nSo does this make you support salary caps?\n\nThey were Man City of non-league football. Big underdog story there. Of course they are hated.\n\nVery annoying and arrogant,the lower leagues man city. The media circus and their influence over it to paint anyone who doesn't like the prior four factors as whatever they want. \n\nGood owners but people who interact with them or have to play and compete against them have every right to feel aggrieved.\n\nThey should be aggrieved by the league they play for that allows this system to occur. They aren‚Äôt the first nor will they be the last to do it. Either fix the league system and implement some kind of salary cap or quit bitching because this is always going to be a valid strategy in a world where there is no spending limit in your sport.\n\nNo problem with them buying the club.\n\nNo problem with them pumping money into the club.\n\nThe issue is them, the media and their fans acting as if they're some fairytale story when they aren't. They spent more on wages their final year in the national league than the vast majority of both league one and league two. \n\nIf they just owned it I'd have much less distaste towards them.\n\nThe problem is that when you pump that much money into a single lower league club it forces other sides to spend more trying to compete and it becomes massively unsustainable.\n\nIt's already hard enough to get promoted from the National League without one team buying promotion. Wrexham buying a promotion prevented another club from earning one fairly. For all the success that comes to Wrexham there's now another town losing out on the benefits of having a football league side all because some rich actors saw the Sunderland documentary on Netflix and decided they wanted to copy that.\n\nThe majority of football fans just want to see a sport with some competitive integrity where teams can actually succeed on merit. Not a sport where success comes down to winning the rich owner lottery or running up enough debt to try and compete with the clubs that did win that lottery.\n\nLower league football won't survive if every few years another bored rich bloke comes along and decides to bankroll one random club to success on a level that other clubs at that level can't compare with. Kids are not going to get emotionally invested in their local teams knowing that no matter how good their team is, how passionate the support it doesn't really matter when you have another team in your league who will just spend a hundred times what your club could ever afford.\n\nWrexham are to lower league football what Man City and their 115 charges are to the Premier League. They undermine the integrity of the sport. But unlike the Premier League the clubs in the lower league cannot rely on International TV audiences and tourist fans to keep them afloat and not having a fair chance at competing will kill them off one by one.\n\nThat's incredibly dramatic and intellectually dishonest. This is still a sport. They are still human beings. \n\nBuying the promotion? Did anyone hand it to them? They still had to play all of the matches. The manager and the players could've had a fallout... Seen it happen many times. There could be no chemistry among the players and bottled most of the matches. Or another million factors could've come into play. It's never guaranteed. Once again, look at Chelsea... or even United! Rich guys buying the club does not guarantee success. It sure helps, but it doesn't guarantee.\n\nLower league football won't survive? I'm sorry but that's incredibly dramatic. How many stadiums filled up to watch Wrexham play? Compare the amount of people watching lower league matches before compared to when Wrexham was bought... The lower leagues would not have this much visibility if not for them. That money won't be funneled down to Wrexham. Maybe other people will look at their business model and lower league clubs will start having wealthy people pumping money into them.\n\nWhy is there a need to pull the other team's level down instead of striving to get one over the Hollywood sellouts or whatever? Were all of the other teams bought as well? Also, if it's that much of a handout, then it means that it affects one season. That's it. After that, it's the usual business.\n\nAnd are they breaking any rules? City breached the FFP 115 times so they should be punished. But as far as I know, Wrexham is not breaking any rules.\n\nThe moment they start fucking up the club for their own personal gain then yes, I will agree with you. Until then there's really not that much wrong with it\n\nI genuinely want to know why you watch football if you have such an issue with the money?\n\nMoney has been a factor of success in football since long before we were born. The correlation between wages spent and final league position has been apparent for decades, and nothing about that has changed or even attempted to change in our lifetime.\n\nSo, why do you watch football when success has always been dictated by money spent, barring a few outliers? It's not like money has just become a factor, it's been this way forever, and hasn't pretended to be anything other than what it is.\n\nPeople like yourself have this weird fantasy of fairness in football, but it has literally never been that way, with the big spenders usually having the success, and the penny scroungers wallowing at the bottom. Thats never changed, and never will change. If you have a problem with that, why even watch at all?\n\nFootball existed before 1992. And even in the early years of the Premier League the financial gulf between clubs was never so wide as it is now. \n\nPreviously the clubs with the most money were the ones who earned it by playing the best football and drawing the biggest crowds. Now the money comes first and the crowds come later.\n\nIt has never been sustainable to pump a lot of money into just a small number of clubs, especially at the lower levels of the game. \n\nBefore the Premier League was formed 7 clubs had ever entered administration. Since the Premier League formed 65 clubs have entered administration. But sure you keep telling yourself that a few rich clubs buying success isn't bankrupting other clubs,\n\nLol. Who's even talking about the Premier League here? I'm certainly not. I'm talking about the entire sport.\n\nMoney dictating success in football is a global practice, not exclusively to England. It has nothing to do with the Premier League, or \"football before 1992\".\n\nWhere you play, what league you're in, or what era we're talking about, money has and always will be a deciding factor - ALWAYS.\n\nSalary capped leagues massively reduce the disparity money can cause.  It absolutely makes the entire league more competitive and even, since way more teams in the league have a possibility to win it\n\nWho tf do you cheer for that You're this salty about finances in a literal multi billion dollar business?¬†\n\nLeicester winning the league was Hollywood. 1 of the biggest clubs in the division being promoted off the back of foreign owners spending lots of money is pretty par for the course.\n\nDidn‚Äôt Leicester win the title while having a massively wealthy owner spending a bunch?\n\nEven Thai billionaires can dream\n\nRelative to the teams they were playing against, not at all. Across the two seasons they were in the premier league before winning it they spent the 14th most out of 23 teams in the division and they got promoted the previous season without spending a penny.\n\nLeicester spend a fair wedge but still far less than their rivals spent and still won the League by a clear 10 points.\n\nWrexham have spent low level Championship money and still have had other clubs pushing them the entire way in both the National League and League 2\n\nNo. Their starting 11 cost less than ¬£25m.\n\nLess than one Ayoze P√©rez!\n\nLess than the going rate for 1 top Championship player without a minute of PL experience.\n\nThey also had an unprecedented run in the english top flight.\n\nUndoubtedly was unprecedented, but the owner was a Thai billionaire nevertheless\n\nAnd still somewhat poorer than his peers\n\nthey probably spent on Vardy Mahrez Kante combined how much City spent on one full back the year Pep went crazy lol\n\nNot even close. Vardy was ¬£1.7m, Mahrez was ¬£450k and Kante was ¬£5.6m.\n\nAnd they did it by breaking FFP along the way (they paid a fine, as there weren‚Äôt points deduction back then)\n\nCompared to the rest of the PL?\n\nNo, this is nonsense.\n\nThey were bottom of the table the prior season for a good chunk.¬†\n\nNot much changed yet they somehow went on to smash teams that season.¬†\n\nConfidence is one hell of a drug in sports.¬†\n\nYou can do a lot worse than these two as owners. My main concern if I was a Wrexham fan would be sustainability if/after they've sold their stake. Questions like the club infrastructure and youth development are essential and one that they will have to address once they'll end up in a situation where they will be outspent by the majority of their rivals, whether that be in L1, the Championship, or even the PL. \n\nMcElhenney has TV money. Reynolds has movie star and marketing baron money. Everyone else has proper oligarch money.\n\n&gt; Questions like the club infrastructure and youth development are essential and one that they will have to address once they'll end up in a situation where they will be outspent by the majority of their rivals, whether that be in L1, the Championship, or even the PL.\n\nThey've been looking for a proper space to built a new training ground, allegedly about the same size as Reading's (maybe a bit smaller). \n\nWe're getting a new Kop end, eventually, and the other stands will be assessed.\n\nMain stand is literally next to one of the main streets in the city and the main pub (where the club was founded) is also next to it, and the other one has student appartments behind it because one of our previous owners sold the land.\n\nSounds wonderful, good luck lads\n\nThe salt in this thread is a sight to behold.\n\nChester fans have take a break from fingering each other to jump on reddit\n\nyeah man this sub is so cynical it‚Äôs insane\n\nIs this the team that beat the US women's team!?\n\nUS women's world cup team were beaten by the Dallas under 15s squad üíÄ\n\nDamn... Testosterone is one hell of a drug.\n\nBehind Stockport again though...\n\nIs it Hollywood when they‚Äôre just outspending everyone else?\n\nYes\n\nWhat happens when you throw money at something, also what happens when you drink and can‚Äôt find a bathroom\n\nYou can throw money at something, but it doesn‚Äôt guarantee it‚Äôll work. Look at Chelsea.\n\nLook who Chelsea compete with...not the same.\n\nI love the series. \n\nI love marvel and love Ryan Reynolds as deadpool. \n\nAnd I like the club a lot as my parent one of them is from Wrexham. \n\nBeing a Liverpool fan I hate city as much as anyone. However for the love of Christ. These have just done what city did on a much smaller scale. And are just buying all the better players than everyone else in the league through success literally pumped into the club financially and commercially. \n\nI hope in 10 years time when these are beating your club to a champions league spot we remember them all how we used too while hating them. \n\nI vividly remember being delighted when they aguero goal meant United lost the league. Fast forward a few years and how that opinion has changed. \n\nSoon as it‚Äôs your club getting run over by them. We‚Äôll all be viewing them like a City-Lite.\n\nExactly. They've done what Liverpool done aswell, spent a shitload, had success then had a load of bandwagoners with no connection to club latch on to them\n\nSpot on. Nobody cares though because Deadpool and always cringe in philly are running the show\n\nUnfortunate photo for RR, making it look like he's pissed his pants\n\nFinancial doping is ok kids‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. As long as it‚Äôs the actor I like.\n\nAh the beauty of something that American sports monopolies will never allow their communities to witness.¬†\n\nThey put a lot of money into it, but it's still amazing what they've done in their first year in League Two. \n\nMeanwhile, Salford City, owned by those ex-United players, is stuck in the mud. Maybe it's luck... who knows but I enjoy wrexham show.\n\nHas Deadpool pissed himself in that photo?\n\nWhen‚Äôs S3?\n\nAt what point do they start looking for further investment?\n\nUnless Ryan wants to put his whole gin fortune into the club, they‚Äôre going to need to get in outside investment (for the championship and especially PL).\n\nSaw them against Colchester and was fairly unimpressed tbh. Reckon they‚Äôll struggle getting out of league 1\n\nIf Doncaster Rovers beating them means they don‚Äôt win the league, Id be happier than us winning 7 games in a row for the first time in 77 years lol.\n\nWtf, spoilers???\n\nI checked the league table. Absolutely insane that Notts Co at 15th place, has scored just 1 goal fewer than the most scoring team.\n\nWith the amount that they have spent, compared to everyone else, it would be a humiliation if they didn‚Äôt get promoted.\n\nA real underdog story.\n\nLeague one will be Wrexham Wall \n\nWe spent 7 years there and MAY go up hopefully  \n\nBut looking at teams that may come down league one could be a ridiculously hard league next season\n\nSo all the Europeans that don't like financial doping in lower leagues, you're all gonna now start advocating for salary caps...right?  Since that's obviously the only way to prevent something like this...right??\n\nTell me honestly, is there any remote chance in hell that Wrexham could one day be playing in the Premier League?\n\nYooo what the fuck, spoiler alert!\n\n/s\n\nJust don't get the weird swooning over this club. Two rich guys cone in, buy/pay players who are levels above, that other clubs can't afford and everyone's like wow amazing underdogs. Battlepass FC mate. I like Eob n Ryan funny as fuck, doesn't change the fact.\n\nSick of seeing these two\n\nGreat news"

    "all_comment_text": "Class act\n\nA lot of people echoing this seem to be assuming this is voluntary, it could be a clause in the contract or some other obligation\n\nFootball players are treated as a commodity and are insured.  The insurance company would pay out.  \n\nThe goodwill gesture from the club would be.  The family wouldn‚Äôt have to wait for the insurance money to be released.  The club would continue to pay the wages as scheduled.\n\nThere aren't testimonial in event of death clauses.\n\nThe fact they aren't trying to avoid the payment (like a couple of clubs from Wales and France) is great.\n\nPanathinaikos are a class act for this. Cardiff should take notice.\n\nThat saga has gone on too long. Horrid situation for the families.\n\nIndeed. I feel for Emiliano‚Äôs family and friends because his death has been turned into an excuse to not pay money.\n\nI feel little but disdain for both clubs. HITC sevens did a good documentary on it and every part of it is fucked up.\n\nBoth are partly responsible for his death. \n\nCardiff are correct though. It was an unfair relegation that‚Äôs destroyed their club. If they‚Äôd paid up quickly I suspect people would be sympathetic to their plight\n\nUnfortunately they‚Äôre assholes so while I think Cardiff do deserve an 8/9 figure restitution I also think ‚Äúfuck them‚Äù\n\nI have absolutely nothing but disdain for Kita too - don't bundle Nantes into this please. But Kita *pushed Sala to leave* when he didn't want to, and is responsible for setting him with this player agent that lead him to this plane...\n\nMere hours before the flight, Sala was saying he didn't feel good with Kita and felt sad for leaving. And then that happened.\n\nThis whole ordeal is awful and every attempt by either club to grab even a penny from it is even more awful.\n\nYes you‚Äôre right clubs aren‚Äôt a monolith and there are figures within them, and contracted to them, that are worthy of critique. Synecdoche is tempting but not helpful. \n\nFwiw I agree the whole thing is very bad taste\n\n[deleted]\n\nLol out of interest are you British? \n\nHe uses a posh register and has an idiolect one would typically associate with the middle classes, or at least reminiscent of middle class sociolect, but a regional accent more typically associated with the working class. \n\nNow if you‚Äôre British this is really common, especially in London and major conurbations, so it doesn‚Äôt really strike me unless I focus on it.\n\nI can totally see why it would hit a non-English ear weirdly though!\n\nIt‚Äôs his inflections and pronunciation more than any sociolect (which would be hard to apply because of the sheer range of regional accents anyway - middle class Mancunian, Liverpudlian, Bristolian, and Londoner would all be the same sociolect and distinctly separate from each other).\n\nLondoner here. Whilst I agree that hearing ‚Äòeducated‚Äô regional accents is perfectly normal, this guy sounds like he had half an elocution course and is trying to fill in the gaps. The sound is less like natural speech, and more like someone who keeps forgetting they‚Äôre being recorded and continuously code shifting back into the ‚Äòposh‚Äô voice‚Ä¶\n\nSo the term sociolect actually refers largely to diction in the classical sense (word choice), rather than accent, though it absolutely does diverge regionally.\n\nAs to his inflections etc I refer to idiolect, as there‚Äôs a great deal of cultural and locative feedback to usage. \n\nReally, we have the death of u-usage to blame for this diffusion (I jest) \n\nYou raise an interesting point about elocution lessons (this isn‚Äôt the 60‚Äôs, but recitation and style were absolutely taught in universities in living memory) \n\nI remember during my undergraduate linguistics classes a research student proposing a theory of accent formation pertaining to RP. They contended that rather than being an educational  function reinforced socially, it‚Äôs a consequence of literary exposure reinforced by education. \n\nThis is supposedly why you have can have smart kids from council estates sounding like Steven Fry. They read a great deal in their youth, have the BBC as -effectively- a babysitter and aren‚Äôt repressed by school.\n\nThis was a long time ago and I can‚Äôt say I paid a lot of attention. Further, I will concede my studies diverged into literary linguistics, and my research area is the early modern period. I am very very far from being an expert on this!\n\nSure, but given we‚Äôve no idea of the man‚Äôs \nsocial status, education, or even where he was raised, wouldn‚Äôt dialect be the more appropriate choice (for either sociolect or idiolect)?\n\nRegards elocution, I was less referencing the educational practice, more that it sounds like deliberate effort has been made somewhere along the way to rid the previous accent (and that it doesn‚Äôt appear to have worked).\n\nInteresting take on RP formation - I feel like there‚Äôs missing variables at play though, the interplay between exposure to literature, education, and social reinforcement (and others which aren‚Äôt immediately germane to the point)  is always there, so a postulate of ‚Äúit‚Äôs not A+B, it‚Äôs B+C‚Äù feels incomplete. Mind you, you did say it was years ago, and it‚Äôs way off the thread.\n\nBesides, I‚Äôm not a linguist, just taking what I‚Äôve observed from being multi-lingual (through education rather than familial instruction) and applying it here. I think I‚Äôll just put subtitles on and throw on some background music instead.\n\nYeah honestly I‚Äôm up poorly and pretty stoned so rambling lol! Wasn‚Äôt expecting something tangentially related to my experience to crop up!\n\nYou‚Äôre mostly right in that a lack of specificity when using these terms is not helpful. My bad!! I stray from dialect because it so strongly connotes locality but you‚Äôre right, it‚Äôs accurate, and probably not worth quibbling over lol\n\nI guess I‚Äôm proposing that it‚Äôs entirely conceivable his speech is organic rather than affected. Or you might be totally right and it‚Äôs a patchy contrivance.\n \nHe could well - like millions- have picked up an ‚ÄòElements of Eloquence‚Äô or ‚ÄòEats, Shoots and Leaves‚Äô etc. There‚Äôs been a little Renaissance of mass market style guides and there‚Äôs loads of tools to aid (lots of which are aimed at second-language acquisition, Business-English courses and such) \n\nYou‚Äôre entirely correct about missing factors. That was the room‚Äôs reaction too iirc but the point he was trying to make wasn‚Äôt that accent formation isn‚Äôt a complex process with plentiful variables. Rather, that reading specifically was an underindexed factor, as evidenced by RP acquisition in unexpected groups, namely working-class children who spent a lot of time reading. \n\nFun seminar but I did not read or check any of his research; so please take this as the Reddit blathering it is!! :)\n\nAlso lol I should‚Äôve mentioned if anything to my ear it‚Äôs the other way around, like he‚Äôs trying to sound less eloquent; more earthy and colloquial ü§î\n\nI think he‚Äôs from Yorkshire so likely it‚Äôs just his way of making his pronunciation a lot more clear than just using his natural voice if you watch his vlogs he sounds more northern. When he first started making videos he was very monotone so the posh accent also gives him a lot more volume which is good.\n\ni‚Äôm just so tired of those fucking freddy adu jokes. it was funny the first few times, but now it‚Äôs just annoying tbh\n\nYes! I'm glad I'm not the only one that has noticed this. His videos are good but I just cannot being myself to watch them any more.\n\nSame can hardly listen to his videos even though they are well made\n\nI don't mind his voice at all. It's kind of the style of the channel.\n\nI always assumed it was AI.\n\n[deleted]\n\nYeah I find it quite jarring. Theres loads of decent channels like that. The contents really good but the narration is horrendous\n\nI wish I could upvote this more than once‚Ä¶ well said\n\nCompletely different scenarios and panathanikos will be legally obliged to pay baldocks contract to his estate in the case of his death (next of kin).\n\nGive your head a wobble what a fucking ghoulish thing to say.\n\nPanathanaikos aren't paying anywhere near the same amount of money. If it were ¬£10m they'd probably do the same.\n\nclassss\n\nrespect\n\nHope it will remain so at the end, that would be really laudable of Panathinaikos.\n- quite often promises are made when there‚Äôs a lot of sadness and attention, but a few years down the line clubs (or insurance companies) don‚Äôt follow through.\n\nQuite a few horrible examples of that in football.\nAIK not paying the signing bonus of Ivan Turina to his widow (Turina had a right to the bonus while he was still alive, but out of kindness because club did not have the money allowed them to pay later);\n\nPortuguese clubs Maritimo (with Marco Antonio who died while staying in shape on holiday going for runs) and Uniao de Leiria (with Hugo Cunha who died playing football with friends) saying that they didn‚Äôt pass away while representing the clubs so they did not owe the widows/family anything of their contracts.\n\nExamples are countless, even like with Nouri when the player survives. Family of Nouri had to fight Ajax tooth and nail for Ajax to admit culpability and take financial responsibility.\n\nClass\n\nThat is very decent, fair play to them.\n\nI‚Äôve never had a favorite team in the Super League Greece, but I do now.\n\nThat's beyond amazing. Most clubs would weasel out of it if they could. Respect to them.\n\nWow, respect\n\nClass. Great gesture .\n\nWasn't he married? I thought it was his wife that raised the concerns when he wasn't answering?\n\nThose classy Greeks at it again\n\nüëè üëè üëè total respect\n\nWow that is class from them. Needs to be the norm!\n\nRespect, and I‚Äôm an Olympiacos supporter.\n\nThat‚Äôs actually incredible. Well played Pana.\n\nWell done üëç\n\nCardiff take notes\n\nThat's a great gesture\n\nRespect ü´° RIP George\n\nTouching üôè\n\nVery nice Panathinaikos üëè\n\nClass act.\n\nClass by the club\n\nVery Extremely Rare Panathinaikos W\n\nThat's a  really classy thing to do.\n\nThat's how it should be, and if they had life insurance on him, like most companies do for their employees, absolutely normal.\n\nWhy the fuck would they do this? And why the fuck are people impressed by it?\n\nPaying out millions to an already wealthy family for no reason whatsoever. Why not pick ten fans who've suffered familial losses and split it between them? That would be life changing. Paying it out to the wife is only making a rich cunt richer. Wake up.\n\n[deleted]\n\nBecause she is the mother of his child?? \n\nWhat a weird comment"

It‚Äôs not that complicated.\n\nOr just shoot from 45 yards out.

What's so hard about that?!\n\nAnd what's this formation you keep talking about? Just go that way &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;!\n\nThat‚Äôs an actual response from R9 when interviewed ages ago, they asked him how he was able to convert most if not all of his 1v1s against keepers and he just said something around the lines of I just put the ball on the far top of the goal, it‚Äôs very simple actually\n\nBadass. Goat striker for a reason üêê\n\nI feel like this is a problem that afflicts so many truly gifted former players who go into management - the things that came naturally to them don‚Äôt to other players and they can‚Äôt get their heads round it.\n\nMost top managers are good players who had to graft hard/play smart to get to their level- Klopp was a journeyman in Germany, Pep was good but not like best in the world tier (ancelloti/poch where probably at a similar level in that they‚Äôd get in good teams and play well enough without being the best players) Mou was a lower league player in Portugal, Tuchel was a lower league player in Germany who had to retire early. Zidane is obviously a bit different\n\nto be fair zidane has managed the best at madrid\n\nWhy do people love to downplay zidanes managerial career? If you want to have the who they managed discussion, then Guardiola is an average manager because he won with unlimited oil money. Not hard to win with the best squad\n\nTbf Guardiola was a very good player in his day- he was basically the prototype of Sergio Busquets as a CDM with additional attacking skill\n\nAll true, but he was like the fourth/fifth best player on his own team in his prime. \n\nStoichov, Koeman, Laudrup, Eusebio, Zubizaretta etc. so many bigger stars than him. He is not like Ronaldo and Messi or Zidane.\n\n&gt;Stoichov, Koeman, Laudrup, Eusebio, Zubizaretta etc. so many bigger stars than him.\n\nNo shame there, that applied for 98% of players at the time. Doesn't mean Guardiola wasn't elite.\n\nThat is what 99.9% of footballers are. Of course that's going to be who makes a good manager, that's also the same background as all of the average and rubbish managers.\n\nI don't think Zidane was very tactically gifted as a manager tho. He just wrote 7 of the best players in the world down and then 4 sensational players and said go score.\nExaggerating a bit but you get the idea\n\nAlonso as well was great and is a very good manager currently\n\nAlso, I think that the best managers come from central midfielder positions. They are the ones who rely most on planning and need to understand and play both phases of the game.\n\nI don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs true. I just think they get frustrated by people who can‚Äôt just execute what‚Äôs in their head. You don‚Äôt get to this level and play vs so many good teams and coaching staffs to not understand how to teach the game and understand it. Absorbing knowledge all your life and applying it to your own game is easy. When you have to then insert your own coaching philosophy, get along with players, and control your own ego is where it gets hard. Especially at that level. They could all coach on some level but maybe not always with a bunch of guys who are only like 20 years younger and just as driven as they used to be. They understand everyone can‚Äôt be Messi, why would you expect everyone to read and react to the game as you do? Messi could know some things better than whoever his MLS coaches do, but that‚Äôs not his job as a player. You buy into the team and you can make suggestions but the coaching staff sets the culture and strategy. I think some of them are just bad at applying those standards. It‚Äôs not like athletes work up to leadership/mentor roles during their tenure climbing a ladder. They just have to figure it out and that‚Äôs understandably tough.\n\nI think this problem is way overblown. Yes, it has happened with some great players, but there's loads of great players that have become great managers. It's a completely different job that requires completely different skills, I think it's far more likely that they aren't suited to it for loads of reasons. There's loads of rubbish players that weren't good managers as well, I don't think that's the reason why.\n\nI remember Henry having this problem at Monaco\n\nLike, he couldn‚Äôt understand that players couldn‚Äôt just do what he did\n\nAlways thought of maradona as manager in this position too. And to a far lesser degree- Rooney.\n\nRooney famously said at Blues, ‚Äòsometimes you just can‚Äôt believe what you‚Äôre watching‚Äô I took this as - why are you all so shit, I could do it, why can‚Äôt you?\n\nHe's in a weird spot where he's managing at his level, paying his dues, learning the game.... But with his player head on it must drive him crazy.\n\nThat's why he's learning tbf. Kudos to him for steering clear of top jobs in the premier league or other leagues and plying his trade in lower ranked leagues instead\n\nEh? How long do you think he needs to learn for? He'd take a prem job in a heartbeat.\n\nYou say that like he hasn't been playing with other people for his entire life and doesn't know what other people are capable of\n\nI remember a quote from my boss, don‚Äôt expect other people to think same as you, man fixed a problem within seconds and no one could understand how, same can be applied here.\n\nI agree. Messi doesn‚Äôt have to worry about avoiding a group of players, he just uses insane close control to waltz right through them. He‚Äôs going to find it difficult to understand nobody else can do what he does.\n\nHis attack wouldn‚Äôt run either. The front 2-3 would just casually walk around expecting to receive the ball.\n\nWhy do I keep seeing such a dumb talking point?\nYou say that like he hasn't been playing with other people for his entire life and doesn't know what other people are capable of\n\n\"Just ankara, bro\"\n\nHis personality isn't suited for top level management, being reserved and quiet doesn't work there.\n\nSeems like he might just want to chill with his gigantic bag post-career, Inter Miami is already half way there. Although he‚Äôs bound to involved in some degree, the football can never leave someone of that magnitude.\n\nI hope we see him around in some form like at a world cup or just around as a legend every now and then.\n\nWhy...?\n\nYeah, can't see him as a manager but I can see him using his financial resources to do some next level stuff for future footballers. Maybe build an academy, for one.\n\nZidane is reserved.\n\nSome teams manage themselves. Look at Chelsea under Avram Grant and Roberto Mancini.\n\nMancini was a lunatic haha. He was fighting with Mario on the training ground\n\nHe's also imposing, if that counts for anything.\n\nWorld class players are often bad managers because they won't be able to connect well with the average squad player.\n\nQuiet, not quite\n\nThanks, corrected it now.\n\nWhy do so many redditors confuse quiet and quite? Is it merely a typo or do they genuinely not understand the difference?\n\nIt's just a typo that is easy to miss\n\nMy brother in Christ most people do not give a shit about words like us. I would never say quite instead of quiet . I would never say would of instead of would HAVE.\n\nWe must accept this and not become the grammar Nazi's trying to start the 4th Grammar Reich like I plan in my head sometimes.\n\nEverytime I see such typos I tell myself, \"this person is probably not a native English speaker\" \n\nEven though its most likely an American who's first language is English. This is reddit after all.\n\nThey‚Äôre, there and their as well.\n\nWhat are you the grammar police\n\nAlonso seems reserved as well and he has been a great manager so far.\n\nYeah he gives the silent investor vibe lol, like he'll be involved or invest in football related things but won't necessary take charge of it \n\nKinda like that Prime competitor that he did recently\n\nMessi would, with all my love, be an awful manager. \"All you need to do is kill it when it drops from the sky, drop the shoulder then dance through three player before smashing it bottom left. Simples\"\n\nThe guy who's football everybody is copying today 50 years later, that Messi grew up playing the football of, could do all those things.\n\nWhat?\n\nCruyff, I missed out a couple of words.\n\nCruyff was in the conversation. Great player. Awesome players at Barca though. He does have a turn named after him though\n\nAt least he‚Äôs honest.\n\nWorld class player doesn‚Äôt always mean you‚Äôll become a world class manager.\n\nThen again with him, I think he‚Äôs got that inspiration to motivate any team.\n\nThis tracks in so many domains. Quiet geniuses often are terrible teachers.\n\nRonaldo also made it clear that he has no intention to become a manager. He'll probably become a full-time youtuber.\n\nWell he already has experience in SA so he is halfways there.\n\nüò≠\n\nWdym halfway there??\n\nHe's already making cringe Qna's with involving personal questions with his girlfriend, creating exaggerated cringe thumbnails, AND as you mentioned that one incident in LA.\n\nHe's as pure a YouTuber as they come\n\nHe probably plays like no role in most aspects of that channel though\n\nDid you really have to abbreviate it? \"SA\"?\n\nYes, the king of reddit told me so.\n\nRonaldo can become a manager. But although, the attention he craves, he will probably eclipse the team, like Jose.\n\nYou hear stories about top level players that become (bad) managers and are baffled that their players can't do things. Messi would be like that amplified.\n\nApparently, when OG Ronaldo was part-owner of a club in Spain, he couldn't understand why the forwards sometimes missed one-on-ones, when \"all they had to do\" was round the keeper to make it a guaranteed goal.\n\nHenry was infamous for this. All the 'simple' instructions that he assumed would be easy for his players was wayyy too high level for them¬†\n\nUnrelated but somewhat is. I notice most professors in my uni that went to MIT kinda suck at teaching. Maybe there‚Äôs a reason for that after all..\n\nExactly this\n\nI feel like he's not really charismatic enough. He's definitely a little bit awkward and pretty quiet. The best managers are people that are naturals at dealing with people.\n\nI am not sure about that tbh, he has grown a lot as a person and a player. You hear the stories about him in the past few years in Barca and Argentina, and he seems like a great leader that everyone would listen to.\n\n Part of that is because of who he is and what he has accomplished, but that will follow him in his entire life anyway. \n\nWith that said, language barrier is a real thing,he is still not comfortable speaking Catalan and English in public, coaches. It will limit him to essentially trying to coach in Spain, or SA.\n\nMessi speaks flawless catalan.\n\nI mean he has been there since he was a kid not surprisng\n\nThe guy said Messi is still uncomfortable speaking catalan which is simply not true.\n\nMessi has maximum charisma.\n\nYou left the \"in public \" part.\n\nMessi was rarely seen speaking it. He usually takes questions in Catalan and almost exclusively answered in Spanish. \n\nNot sure if this has changed recently, but not to my knowledge\n\nYes. I don't like the word \"charismatic\" but managing is as much about personality as it is tactics and so on.  A manager has to be able to connect with people in a way that Messi, who comes across almost as an autistic savant, will never be able to do.\n\nTfw the retirement talk has started in full force for both Messi and Ronaldo\n\nThey've been retired since they left Europe\n\nSemi Retired. Once they retire from their national team, then I would consider them effectively fully retired.\n\nThey already retired. \n\nWhat they are playing now is being a circus attraction for their Clubs to promote football in the countries they're playing. And getting a really big bag of money to be that character.\n\nlol. Messi is still playing for the current best national team, and just made a hat trick for them in world cup qualifying.   \n    \nYou make it sound like they are fat and just receiving checks.\n\nSlowing down doesn't mean they still aren't quality.\n\nThat statement only applies to Messi, Ronaldo has been finished for atleast 2 years.\n\n‚ÄúGuys, you are fucking shit. You are telling me you can‚Äôt just take it past 7 players and score? Fucking puto, go play basketball they only have 5 to go past‚Äù\n\nUnlike a lot of elite footballers he‚Äôs self aware enough to realise that his supernatural footballing gifts are primarily down to his god given talent rather than something that can be managed. As probably the most naturally gifted footballer of all time he probably doesn‚Äôt even know what it is about him that makes him so much better than everybody else. He just is.\n\nNow let's wait for Ronaldo to say the opposite and that he will become the best manager that ever existed.\n\nMessi‚Äôs HT team talks would just be silence\n\nI feel like the most talented footballers are often not the best managers. There are exceptions of course, but I genuinely think that a player like Messi is never incentivized to think tactically. When from the youth onwards you can receive the ball, make an insane dribble, score a goal consistently you don't ever need to. That is not to say they are tactically bad, just to say the do the right things on intuition, but that is harder to teach.   \nI recall Van Basten saying something like 'I couldn't understand why my players couldn't do what I taught them and realised it was because they were not seeing things the way i saw them in my head' .\n\nHenry has the same problem when he was a manager at Monaco, he was telling players to do things he could do. Not realising only a handful of players in history could even attempt those things\n\nIs it still too tight! That clip perfect encapsulates what your saying and can definitely see it applying to Messi too¬†\n\nWith all the money he has why would he even bother. Just chill for the rest of his life.\n\nDoing nothing for 50 years would be boring as fuck, especially for an elite athlete. Half the reason footballers have so many problems after retiring is they either get bored and start drinking too much or get bored and make stupid business decisions trying to keep busy.\n\n&gt;I would much rather like, make a mountain of cash and take a really nap on it, like a dragon\n\nperson hungry command memorize subtract grab long snails slap mighty\n\n *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev/home)*\n\nProbably be a great support staff though. Technical coach\n\nExcited for him to start a YouTube channel and start beefing with ronaldo\n\nThat‚Äôs too bad, I think he probably understands the game more than almost anyone.\n\nHe‚Äôs too introverted and quiet to be a manager in all honesty\n\nDoesn't surprise me, how do you coach something that to you comes so naturally?\n\nHe has the charisma of a yoghurt. I'm sure he's been advised not to.\n\nthe best players don‚Äôt necessarily make the best coaches. but in messi and ronaldo‚Äôs case i could imagine them after years of them dominating world football, they wouldn‚Äôt be able to lead a team to some mild success at least. not saying they should go and coach madrid and barcelona but maybe they could manage teams in their own countries\n\nWe know lol\n\nHes not gifted in managing enough became a player\n\nAt least in Football Manager he became one in my save. üòÅ\n\nGee, I wonder who will be appointed coach of Barcelona in 2030...\n\nBusquets\n\nEither him or Fabregas. Iniesta is also taking coaching courses\n\nThiago also\n\nHe's right. He has done enough for the game\n\nI'm hoping he stays in Miami after retirement.  He could work with inter Miami as a talent evaluation guy. He will be involved in Futbol some how moving forward.\n\nYeah I don't think he or Ronaldo pull eb good coach imo. Especially not neymar.\n\nMessi i as a meat head and also never bothered to learn another language\n\nI think he‚Äôs mentioned he likes working with kids. Would be cool to see him in an academy in some capacity.\n\nTeams down 3-1 at HT. All the players in the change room. Messi walks in, pulls out a tablet and shows them top 30 goals by Messi. Doesn‚Äôt say a word. Walks out\n\nMemessi\n\nWatch, if he did he‚Äôd play hoof ball üòù\n\nThat's what he says now, but after he doesn't play anymore we'll see.\n\nenough money to just chill the rest of his life\n\nWhat I‚Äôm hearing is Messi knows who he is. Which is one of the best things a person can have.\n\nI‚Äôm sure he wants to stay involved in football because he loves it. And he won‚Äôt be someone like Pele or Maradona, both of whom when still alive really behaved like they were GOATs and compared other players to themselves. So I‚Äôm eager to see how Messi stays involved in old age.\n\nWe‚Äôre lucky.\n\nWhat do you mean by Pele comparing himself to others? Im sure Pele gave his opinion on players compared to him and yeah obviously in Pele era he was the best. But in this era and for now i doubt there will be someone like Messi for quite a while i dont think people really understand what Ronaldo/Messi did they are miles clear of players like cruyff pele maradona. But then again why even compare to a sport that 30-50 years ago was something completly different. The football that is played today has evolved to new levels.\n\nMessi on the 1st day: What part of dribbling past half the team, nutmeg the world no. 1 CBs and score a screamer from outside the box you don't understand.\n\nUnderstandable, the guy lives under pressure every single day. He deserves a peaceful life.\n\nNooooooooooooooooo! Please!\n\nBro just wanna chill now and that's what you would wanna do if you won everything\n\nNot quite as easy as scoring on Nashville (which my grandma could do).\n\n\"What do you mean you can't sit down 5 defenders when you've got 30 yards to run and lob an inch perfect pass into the correct foot of your striker?\"\n\nMessi is probably gonna do as Pele did.\nRonaldo on the other hand will go on as massively overpaid coach for the Indonesian/Thai/belizian/Congolese/Ethiopian/belo-russian national teams in addition to some shit premier division clubs scattered across Europe. It's going to be 30 year continuation of the narcissistic experience Ronaldo personifies.\n\nnah he's probably just gonna work as a YouTuber. but hey Ronaldo has the cringe part done with cringe thumbnails, stuff about his girlfriend and himself; all of it is what a cringy YouTuber does\n\nMessi has said what he wants to do after his career. He has said mutliple times he wants to be a spirting director for barcelona and either be in charge of signings or scout players for barca\n\nVery rarely are great players good managers in any sport. Zizou is like the rare exception\n\nThe guy got a billion dollars in the bank, he'll do whatever he wants\n\nI would love to see Ronaldo as a manager purely for the car crash it would be. Completely unsuitable at any level and would be a disaster.\n\nYou either die a hero or live long enough to be a manager. Playing and managing are two different ball games. Messi is smart to know his strengths and continue focus on it than changing sports.\n\nFor all Messi have done in football, I think that's more than enough.¬†\n\nOh he's definitely going to get a managerial role once he retires. Maybe not straight away, but it's gonna happen soonerlater\n\nSo much for that obvious Lionel Messi face that keeps getting used for generic managers in the EA FC career modes\n\nHGH definitely works. HGH has won more Ballon D'Ors than any other chemical.\n\nHe'll have earned his rest.\n\nHard to organise mortals for him I'd imagine.\n\nThis is random but can anyone think of a successful short manager?\n\nOf course, it's well known that players high in natural talent don't make good managers. They can't relate to the players who have to work hard instead of relying on their natural talent. This is not to say that he's not a hard worker btw\n\nOff the top of my head, Zidane and Cruyff are the only two all time greats who‚Äôve had success as managers that equaled their play\n\nchill man\n\nHonestly, I would much rather listen to him as a pundit - or a YouTube vlog/podcast.\n\nManagers are often made by players who weren't amazing in their prime, so needed to dedicate more time to learning strategy and overall team management rather than playing in the limelight\n\nHe can become an English Premier League football club owner/chairman. ‚öΩÔ∏èüèÜüó∫\n\nFor sure almost any ownership group would welcome him. If he ends up enjoying life in Miami though‚Ä¶part of his contract is that when he retires from MLS, he has an option to be come a part owner of Inter Miami.\n\nWe‚Äôll see, I‚Äôd think he‚Äôd exercise it no matter what, not sure just how involved or present he‚Äôll be though.\n\nAnd why would he do that?\n\nJust become an agent.¬†\n\nPeople who judge his intelligence find this decision intelligent enough...\n\nPeople.......\n\nGreat player / Great manager = Zidane, Cruyff\n\nThere's a good few. Beckenbauer, Ramsey, Heynckes, Pep, Alonso, Aragones, Mancini, Enrique, Capello, Del Bosque, Ancelotti, Zagallo, Munoz, Dalglish, Simeone, Trapattoni, Happel.\n\nBeckenbauer‚Äôs the only one of that lot who was on the level of Cruyff/Zidane as a player\n\nThey don't need to be at that level to be a great player. If you have to be a top 10 player of all time to count, of course there's not going to be many.\n\nWith all due respect, those aren't the perfect combination of GREAT players during their playing days and GREAT manager during their tenure as head coach or Manager.\n\nZidane and Cruyff is levels ahead as players\n\nAre they not? Beckenbauer is a top 10 player of all time, and won a World Cup and a league title as a manager. Dalglish was the one of the top 5 players in the world when he played, and won multiple league titles as a manager. Heynckes was one of the forwards in the world when he played and won a treble with Bayern Munich. Ancelotti was the playmaker of the greatest teams in the history of both AC Milan and Roma, and won multiple league titles and European Cups as a manager and as a player. Zagallo was the key tactical piece as a player to Brazil to Brazil winning 2 World Cups, and then managed what is widely considered to be the best World Cup team of all time. Xavi Alonso was one of the best midfielders of his generation,and has just overseen one of the best seasons in the history of club football, anywhere, and is certainly more impressive than Zidane winning CL's with Madrid. \n\nYou can't say there's no great players who were great managers and then when multiple are proposed say they weren't good enough as players because they aren't top 10 players of all time. If that's the case, of course there aren't that many that would have great management careers, there's barely any to choose from\n\nNot at the level of Zidane and Cruyff mate.\n\nNobody said they were. Nobody said they had to be. That's something you've just decided is a thing for some reason.\n\nI said. Because that's my point.\n\nSo there's only 6 great players in the history of the game?\n\nBeckenbauer was a greater player, and his managerial career is pretty much just as good. Except he did well in different environments.\n\nZidane, Cruyff is in the top 10 of all time great players.\n\nNo one expects him to go into management anyway. Was never a leader or tactician on pitch.\n\nGod the obsession with Ronaldo is crazy. He is mentioned no where but is still somehow brought up in this discussion"

As players get older in their mid/later 30s it gets harder for them to score against the same level of opposition.  As Ronaldo hit that age he has maintained his scoring output.  Either he's exceptional in this respect (along with many others) or the level of his opposition has dropped.   \n\nSeems pretty clear that both are true to some extent, but suspect it's a bit more the level dropping...\n\nAs a United fan, we are shit but Ronaldo had like 8 game winners for us between the Europa and EPL at 36. One hat trick against Totty. Ended up top 3 or something in the league. The man is a legend.\n\nUnited are god awful\n\nHe was in the PL till he was 36. The level didn‚Äôt drop at all.\n\nHonestly I think 17 goals in that dog ass of a United team might be his biggest achievement\n\nNo one is trying to discredit the first 658\n\nPele has just risen from the grave to net a couple more goals past the groundskeeper of the cemetery\n\nSeriously though, people give Pele way too much grief for this. \n\nMany of his \"friendlies\" were the biggest games in the world at the time but \"unofficial\" while Ronaldo scoring against Morecambe or some Saudi team with 300 fans (no exaggeration) counts as an \"official game\"\n\nRomario shuffles nervously‚Ä¶\n\n1000 goals needs some ridiculously one sided games in there. Nobody has scored 1000 goals in el Classico matches only.\n\nSo? This is true for all players\n\nExactly. Otherwise we start discounting penalties or tap ins. Let‚Äôs just all agree it‚Äôs bloody hard to do!\n\nMy main point really is that many people read \"competitive games\" and think of it in a modern context where the only non competitive games are preseason friendlies that are essentially fitness sessions\n\nSantos dropped out of many big tournaments for many years so that they could your the world and face many of the best teams ever in huge sell out matches. They weren't the same as modern day \"friendlies\"\n\nFrom that a narrative has seemed to spawn where Pele kept lying about how many goals he scored\n\nHe scored 18 in 30 elclasico games. Not many would have better scoring rate in what you described a tough game.\n\nPeles record is impressive but even if you count the friendlies with footage he'd still have less\n\nIt's beyond impressive and yes they had less footage of games back then, that doesn't mean there's not records. Some people like to think he just made up stats\n\nHe didn't make them all up but he doesn't have more than Ronaldo\n\nWhy has footage become so important to people all of a sudden?\n\nDoes the generation coming through need everything to be on YouTube and ignore school books etc now because they aren‚Äôt videos?\n\nFootage and records shows proof.\n\nso writing everything down and broadcasting it all over the world by news paper doesnt count?\n\nCould be a lie. + Pele was stated to have 767\n\nyou do know that every single match he played in you could see the results who scored... they didnt tell assist tho. so every match he played a bunch of journalist should have faked his goal tally for every match for 26 years?\n\nThis puts into perspective how braindead the guy you're replying to is.\n\nDid you watched a video of that statement?\n\nIt was 757 official goals plus ten others. It doesn‚Äôt mean all the rest suddenly didn‚Äôt happen. \n\nI guess you‚Äôre under 20 and haven‚Äôt known life without having cameras everywhere\n\nI saw your silly argument about friendly matches and not being full strength etc. so you don‚Äôt have a clue about how friendlies used to be either and are you going to remove Ronaldo‚Äôs friendly goals too then?\n\n&gt;Did you watched a video of that statement\n\nYes I literally sent an article on it.\n\n&gt;I saw your silly argument about friendly matches and not being full strength etc. so you don‚Äôt have a clue about how friendlies used to be either and are you going to remove Ronaldo‚Äôs friendly goals too then?\n\nRonaldo has 900 OFFICIAL goals you clown. If we counted friendlies he'd be around the 1000 mark but we're not.\n\nYes you sent an article but you don‚Äôt believe words only videos remember?\n\nWait‚Ä¶ so are you not including his 2 goals against the Republic of Ireland in June? Then he‚Äôd be on 898\n\nBy that account any sort of history before the invention of cameras could also be a lie and shouldn‚Äôt be taken seriously. Those were different times, not everything was recorded in football, you can‚Äôt apply modern day standards to old times. You could make the argument that Pele‚Äôs 1200 goals maybe weren‚Äôt as meaningful as Cristiano‚Äôs 900 because the game wasn‚Äôt as competitive or as professional back then (which Id also disagree with, but it would be valid at least), but you can‚Äôt categorically say that he didn‚Äôt score those goals because there wasn‚Äôt record of them all. Those 767 are in what today are considered official matches, which wasn‚Äôt even a concept back then. And if I‚Äôm not mistaken he even received a letter for the then FIFA president congratulating him on his 1000th goal.\n\nHow braindead are you? Those historical events literally have several documents and witnesses. Peles goals are literally from the word of his friends and explain why he kept on changing his goal tally from 767 then when Ronaldo overtook it.\n\nhow do you want every match played in south america in the 60s to have footage?\n\n[He's stated to have 767](https://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/pele-stats-goals-world-cup-wins-brazil-legends-other-trophies/1j7l9iu09le1v14q60ct2dpfnm)\n\ndid you even read the shit you just sent me? lol\n\nWhat's the excuse this time?\n\n\"The exact number of goals Pele scored in his career is a matter of dispute and figures vary, but he is reported to have found the net over 1,000 times.\n\nAccording to FIFA's official website, Pele scored 1,281 goals in 1,363 games, but it must be noted that this figure includes data from a significant number of unofficial matches, such as friendly tours with Santos and the New York Cosmos. Guinness World Records, meanwhile, state that Pele scored 1,289 times in 1,363 matches.\"\n\nthe number you said is excluding friendlies, but if you think winning against al kholood is a more valuable accomplishment than beating wolfsburg 6-3, than i won't even waste my time arguing.\n\nYeah I'm sure Pel√© didn't play games against weak teams.\n\nHe did, as has every footballer. However many of his \"friendly games\" that people don't count towards his record were extremely important and competitive matches unlike today's friendlies\n\nThat's why this is the \"Official Matches Goal Record\".\n\nI agree about the friendlies, but iirc, he changed the number as CR7 got closer and closer\n\nMost experts have always agreed with a number of around 1280. Some people just don't like to hear facts\n\nwhat do you mean he changed the number? he was shown as 1300+ way before cr7 was born\n\nIt‚Äôs not just the friendlies that goes against Peles record, it‚Äôs the level he played at for most of his career and the fact that most of his goals were scored against semi pro and amateur teams. Not even at Saudi Pro League level.\n\nBut that's just not true. You can find almost all his competitive goals between the campeonato paulista (he's the top scorer ever),  campeonato brasileiro, copa liberadores and international matches. Oh and he wasn't just stat boosting vs gilbraltar and San Marino in those internationals like Ronaldo, he was actually dominating world cups. \n\nWhich amateur games are you referencing?\n\nWell I‚Äôm referencing the fact that Brazil didn‚Äôt have a national professional league until 1971. It was split into regional leagues filled mostly with local semi professional and amateur teams, and only after 1971 did the top professional teams around the country start to play each other, the same way you would expect in a modern top flight league.\n\nYes but the other Sao Paulo teams were very competitive. Obviously the state is known for its football with massive clubs like Santos, Corinthians, Sao Paulo, Palmeiras, Botafogo. I didn't know how many teams were professional or semi professional but obviously the economics of football were very different in the 60s so an amateur footballer then is not the same as an amateur footballer now.\n\nWhat we can see by looking back at the Campeonato Paulistas from the late 60s is that they weren't one sided. If there were shitty amateur teams in it then you would expect to see the top sides have massive amounts of goals scored and the bottom teams to have massive amounts of goals conceded but that's not the case. \n\nYou can go on wiki and look at the final league tables from that time and see that it was quite competitive. The goals scored per game from Santos seems to always be less than the goals per game of Ah-Hilal and Al-Nassar last season and the worst teams in the league were conceding a lot less than the worst Saudi teams. I don't think it's a fair criticism.\n\nI agree Santos weren‚Äôt the only team competing, they had some competition from other professional teams but the majority of teams Santos faced domestically were amateur or semi professional. \n\nYou‚Äôre right, towards the late 60s the league did become much more competitive because of the increase in teams becoming professional which led the establishment of the national league in 1971. Interestingly though, this coincides with Peles lowest scoring seasons where he posted more average numbers, only breaking the 20 barrier once. \n\nIf you look at the league tables up until 1965 when most teams hadn‚Äôt turned professional yet, you‚Äôll find the exact trend you‚Äôre talking about with teams scoring a ridiculous amount of goals and many many teams conceding far more than expected over the course of a season. This is when Pele was scoring stupid numbers in a season and it was half of his career in Brazilian football.\n\nNah he‚Äôs in heaven nutmeging Jesus then scoring a bicycle kick\n\n[removed]\n\nHe‚Äôs a failure at the World Cup though\n\nlmao pendu fans downvoting facts\n\nImma be honest, I‚Äôm a neutral but Messi fans are definitely the more toxic and insecure fan base. The goat debate is boring anyway, why can‚Äôt we just celebrate 2 fantastic footballers without comparing\n\nYou‚Äôre calling Messi fans insecure üòÇüòÇüòÇ\n\nYea more than Ronaldo fans\n\nOnly 100 more needed\n\nWe will be there\n\n85 to go\n\nNo body will ever beat this record and heres why.\n\nLet's take the best striker in world football right now Haaland he has 194 goals currently since 2017. \n\nRonaldo has scored 900 goals in 22 years. \n\nSo if Haaland was to reach 22 years in football he's currently scored 194 goals for club and Country in 7 seasons so for the next 15 seasons (he'd be 39) he would have to score 47 goals every season for 15 years straight and he'd end on... 899 goals\n\nLet that sink in\n\nhaaland has 263 career goals, which is double what ronaldo had at 24. he‚Äôs beyond capable of smashing 1000 goals.\n\nThe issue is wanting to play until he is 39. \n\nNot many players want to play for that long. Some of them have kids, wives. And just wanna retire. Not have to deal with the constant travel, training, and eating regiment. \n\nTo play for that long, you have to be psychotic in a good way.\n\nPsychotic isn't the right word for that at all. He is obsessed, hates losing and loves winning, from winning a duel on the pitch to winning the Champions League, not losing touch with reality lol.\n\nRemind me in 15 years?\n\nAt Haaland's age Ronaldo hadn't even started to play striker.\n\nHe‚Äôs not downplaying the numbers Ronaldo put down at Haaland‚Äôs age. He‚Äôs just stating that Haaland has the possibility to reach 1000 goals, because he has more goals than Ronaldo had at his age.\n\nAlso Haaland won't do it beacuse he gets injured once he's past 30 you watch his body break down quickly\n\nOk sports science nostradamus\n\nYou don‚Äôt need to be a sports science nostradamus to see this. Ronaldo in his prime was the most physically fit player on earth. It was more likely that you‚Äôd bang Megan Fox than Ronaldo getting injured back then. Haaland has already shown he can pick up an injury here and there. And also his stature is really weird. It‚Äôs fair to say Haaland is likely to end with more injuries than Ronaldo.\n\nLet's see what happens.. this many injuries at the age of 24 is a telling sign. All depends if he plays for a team where he has to do more than hang around the 6 yard box and score. Citys playstle suits him perfectly\n\nPenaldo in 7 seasons at Premier League\n\n1 league top-goalscorer + 1 Golden Shoe\n\nHaaland in 2 seasons\n\n2 PL top scorer + 1 Golden Shoe + way way way better goal per game ratio than penaldo the fraud..\n\nSo your bigging up Haaland here and then on comments 4 days ago saying he shits his pants in big games üòÇ\n\nYour hilarious little clown\n\nvs Messi, clown, not vs the other tap-in merchant aka Penaldo, lmaooo,,,\n\nthis clown has sub-zero iq thinking Messi the GOAT playmaker + dribbler is also a tap-in merchant like his idol\n\n¬†üòÇ¬†üòÇ\n\nMessi was once called a tap in merchant when he was scoring goals no further out from the 18 yard box üòÇ you probably don't remember those days you probably weren't born before Messis greatest football year.. \n\nMessi was never scoring screamers in those days, or free kicks either he would either dribble and chip the keeper or Curl one in from the 18 yard box. \n\nYour hatred for Ronaldo and sheer bumming of Messi is hilarious kittle clown. All this time away and your still clearly using this platform purely to bash Ronaldo and dick ride Messi.\n\nHaaland will fall of hard when starts getting into he's 30s and loses pace. ronaldo and messi could adapt their game because they where technically great haaland is not and  relys so much on  physical and when he cant bully defenders or out  pace them i dont see him scoring tons of goals into late 30 and thats without even talking about staying fit and injuries.\n\nThe problem with Haaland is his National team sucks so he doesn't get much play time outside club matches.\n\nLate to the party but don't forget.... Ronaldo had spent his first 3-4 career years as a non-striker.\n\nLet's come back at the end of his career then? What stake are we putting he doesn't beat it\n\nIdk, Haaland is a terrific striker but he couldn‚Äôt even net 1 goal against freakin *Kazakhstan* today. I can see him getting ~800 career goals, but 1000 is the stuff of legends.\n\nRonaldo has played Kazakhstan and not scored too!\n\nHmm I didn‚Äôt know that. Thanks!\n\nIf Haaland goes to the Saudi league then I'm pretty sure he'll score atleast 1000 career goals in his lifetime. And don't forget that Messi is also only 60 goals away from 900. Messi scored 12 in 12 this season so far so I'm pretty sure he'll be beating this record in far less games than Ronaldo\n\nMessi will 100% retire before Ronaldo. So this isn‚Äôt happening. And judging by how physically unfit he‚Äôs been i‚Äôd wager he isn‚Äôt even hitting that 900 mark.\n\nThe Saudi sportswashing project will probably end long before Haaland reaches that point in his career.\n\nThere will always be crap leagues where players can statpad if they really want to. He could literally go and play in the Norwegian league into his forties if he was that bothered about breaking records.\n\nYour comparing Haaland now tho, not Haaland at Ronaldos current age. \n\nThat's why that doesn't work. Messi is younger and his goal numbers have gone down massively since leaving Barca and playing for a team that doesn't play a system to cater to him. He failed at PSG and now in the MLS his numbers aren't like Ronaldos. \n\nMessi scored 13 goals last season Ronaldo scored 35\n\nI guarantee this Ronaldo will out last Messi..  if he wants to. Messi has already slowed down and focused more on passing/assisting the last few years. \n\nAs soon as he left Barca every team he played in including the national team unless it was set up for him and his style. They failed. \n\nThis is evident when the Argentina squad and manager stated they were setting up for the 2022 to play for Leo to win for Leo. \n\nWhen he joined PSG he flopped beacuse the system wasn't suited for him. \n\nThe MLS and Inter Miami are suited for him they brought alot of players he's played with. He still won't score more this I guarantee you\n\nThe older Messi gets the more of a playmaker he is as oppose to Ronaldo slowly becomes a pure striker as he ages,and Messi has lost the hunger since the world cup he has nothing to prove anymore I don't think he really care for Inter Miami while Ronaldo is aiming for 1000 goals whatever it takes.Also his numbers for PSG and MLS isn't bad at all lol more than 1 G/A per game\n\nHe always was a playmaker, he just scored a crazy number of goals at the same time. \n\nHe makes the teams he is in tick while this decade Ronaldo relies on his team to serve the goals on a plate in comparison\n\nI agree with most of what you've said but hold on a minute with the Messis record for PSG and Inter Miami isn't that bad. Don't put them together to make it look less like his time at PSG was bad, he scored 32 goals on 75 games that's not a goal per game.\n\nHe said \"more than 1 G/A per game\". He has 107 G/A in 104 games for both Inter Miami ans PSG combined\n\nLol dude you are delusional, argentina made for Messi won tha world cup and every player there knows he was mvp, messi in psg wasn't bad, they lost the league the year before he came and he made more than 1 g/a per game next season to win the league.\n\nOn the other hand, Portugal players, mamadera and fans thought of ronaldo as a problem in the world cup and they lost against a weaker team, the don't respect him like argentina respects messi because he is not a true leader, he just wants glory for himself, now in Saudi he can't even win 1 title so he only has that goal record going for him.\n\nIf messi had the drive to get 1000 goals he would do it no doubt about it, but he won't because he already finished football, he doesn't care about anything else now.\n\nI mean I wouldn't say its delusional to say that. It was said publicly that the Argentina team built a system purely to get the best out of Leo. So that's not false that's a fact. \n\nAlso, I'm not the one in these comments discrediting anything this is a post about Ronaldos achievements yet Messi Lovers / Ronaldo haters come go make excuses. \n\nMessis time at PSG was a flop you can't say otherwise 32 goals in 75 games and won nothing that wasn't expected of them. How's that brilliant?\n\nThe fact Ronaldo is the only player for Portugal to play every minute suggests the rest of the squad was weaker than Ronaldo himself. \n\nPeople quickly forget there was a time Argentina fans hated and were booing Messi and he quit National football. \n\nYes Messi won the league in France wow something that is expected every year from them. It was the CL they wanted. When did Messi last win that? In a team that had players around him like Xavi and Iniesta\n\nWhere was Portugal before Ronaldo they have literally got into every tournament with him since he started and won a major trohpy too. \n\nThat's just a Messi fans excuse if Messi wanted it he'd do it. \n\nSo your saying after 2015 he never wanted the CL mmm some how I dont believe that. \n\nBTW I'm not a Messi hater I'm simply saying the obvious Ronaldos record won't be beaten.

They truly think Portugal was a nothing football nation before this youtuber..\n\nMan what are you even saying? Why is it about team achievements for Messi and personal achievements for Ronaldo? How is that fair? Either way, Messi has won more since leaving Barca than Ronaldo has since leaving Real. How can you say Messi was a flop at psg and not even mention Ronaldo at Juve or united? Juve went all in bringing Ronaldo in to win the CL, how come that wasn‚Äôt considered a flop but Messi at psg was? \n\nThe Ronaldo-Portugal statement is baffling. Did you even watch the games? I genuinely don‚Äôt understand how Ronaldo played every game = he was the best player. You don‚Äôt think it had anything to do with being forced to play Ronaldo? No one who watched those games thinks Ronaldo was a positive. Ridiculous. \n\nGet off his nuts.\n\nWhy is it on a post regarding Ronaldos acheivments that you feel the need to drag Messi and every other player into it. I think your on Messis nuts more tbh. \n\nI'm stating Ronaldos record won't be beaten, yet here are all the Messi fans crying about Ronaldo and why Messi has to be the GOAT, answer me this could he do it on a wet night in Stoke. And if you don't get that get of this sub. You discredit everything Ronaldo has done and state Messi Messi Messi. \n\nNo one thinks Ronaldo was a positive mmmm yeah that's Cap. Your fooling no one with how much your up messis arse here, \n\nRonaldo at Juventus ? What your actually saying his Juventus record is worse then messis Psg that's hilarious. He got 10 goals while Ronaldo in his first season at Juventus finished with 28 then the season after won the golden Boot. How is that worse than Messis. \n\nRonaldo has scored more goals 405 since leaving Madrid at the age of 33 than Messi who I know is 2 years younger but Messi has scored 166 goals since the age of 33 in 2020. \n\nAlso Messi has won more yes because he went to a team that was expected to win the league every year and one of the years they didn't even do that. \n\nAtleast Italy is more competitive than France. \nAnd as for Utd he could have gone to City and won a treble and look he turned that down for a challenge so yeah your argument makes 0 sense well done.\n\nJuve before Penaldo -8 Serie As in a row \\_ 2 UCL finals in 3 years\n\nwith Penaldo -lost their first Serie A in 11 years + lost to Ajax/10-man Porto/Lyon from the farmers league, lmaaaoo..\n\nPSG before Messi - 3 Ligue 1s in 5 years (including losing the year before Messi joined)\n\nwith Messi: won 2 out of 2\n\nbut but Serie A harder, lmaaaoo..\n\n--------------------------\n\ncomparing Messi with Penaldo after 2020,loooll...\n\n**Messi after 2020**\n\n3 Ballon D'or\n\nWC MVP + COPA MVP + Finalissima MOTM\n\n2 La Liga top scorer\n\n1 time La Liga most assists\n\n1 time Ligue 1 most assists\n\n2 IFFHS World's Best Playmaker\n\n**Penaldo after not even 2020. after 2018**\n\n0 Ballon D'or\n\n0 MVP award in any international tourney\n\n0 WC knockout goal\n\nbenched in WC, rejected in Europe, sent to exile to camel league\n\n1 time top-scorer in Serie A (only one time in the last 9 years in Europe)\n\nloooll....\n\nWow Messi won 2 Ballon Dora after 2020 1 belonged to Lewandowski and the other to Haaland \n\nGreat going robbing 2 players. \n\nGifting a Balon Dor to someone who only played well for 4 weeks over a 12 month period.\n\nGreat insight. \n\nThere's so many stats we can drop about Ronaldo that Messi hasn't done but why bother\n\n\n2 things are clear, \n\nYour a Messi Fan and typical Ronaldo hater, \n\nAnd a little bitch keep it up\n\npendu fan vocabulary key words when cooked\n\nrigged\n\nrobbed\n\ncopium\n\nfavored\n\nin pain\n\nbut but\n\nwhat if\n\ndaddy Messi\n\ntrying to cope\n\ncorruption\n\nreject\n\nbotox\n\ncamel\n\ntap-in\n\n0 WC knockouts\n\n\n\nowned as usualüòÇü§£üòÇ\n\nDrive is part of being great though. But messi still GOAT. Btw he was ‚Äúonly‚Äù 2nd best at the world cup. Mbappe slightly better but messi won\n\nThis \"Messi flopped at PSG\" narrative is insane. Just look at his numbers and the actual matches he played. He played well and still had great numbers. Not prime Messi numbers but still good enough to give any top player a run for his money. Messi also played a bit deeper. Sure he didn't bring PSG to a CL final, but there was more wrong about that PSG side than Messi's CL performances. \n\nMessi played 75 PSG matches and had a 67 g/a ratio. That's not a flop. He also scored very important goals in Ligue 1.\n\nI can understand saying \"I expected more from Messi.\" But flop? A of 67 g/a in 75 matches?\n\nWhat are his numbers from his 1st season at PSG post that then we can talk. And don't make an excuse either. \n\nRonaldo leaves Madrid for Juvnetus hits the ground running, Ronaldo leaves Juventus for Man Utd (my piss poor team) hits the ground running and is the clubs top scorer etc etc.\n\n‚ÄúHits the ground running‚Äù and yet his teams got objectively worse. Hmm.\n\nThe argument was about his PSG tenure. Not about specific seasons. Cherrypicking at its finest. The person I replied to called Messi at PSG a flop. Which it clearly isn't according to the stats or the eye test, which is relevant for us people that actually watched him pay there. \n\nAnd like I said. You can think Messi not singlehandedly putting them in a CL final and winning it for them is a disappointment, but it's not a flop. A flop would be not winning Ligue 1 and barely scoring goals and barely giving any assists and not contributing as a team player. \n\nAnd to answer your question. Messi had a g/a of 26 in his first season at PSG, in 35 matches. Which also aren't flop numbers. He also played a lot of matches as a deeper lying playmaker. Clearly a change of role vs his Barca role and he assisted Mbappe a lot. Their chemistry also became a lot better in his second season. \n\nI don't think you people know what a flops is. Of you are too young to understand how good these numbers are because you are used to insane prime Ronaldo and Messi numbers, while that isn't normal. Messi still manages to get crazy good numbers if you'd compare this to other top players. In Dybala's best scoring season he had a g/a of 33 in 46 matches. Which was his peak season. While generally he scores under Messi's \"flop season\" lol\n\nWhat are penaldo's numbers at United clown last season?\n\n1 goal in 10 games, lmaoaaoo..\n\n[deleted]\n\nBut that's another hurdle. Any player trying to beat Ronaldo's record has to be freakishly fit, injury free and play almost every game for 15 years. It's borderline impossible.\n\nI'm glad someone else gets it. Too many Ronaldo haters here trying to discredit what the man has done and making up shitty excuses as to why he's done it. \n\nHe's played for more than 1 club - yes that makes it harder\nHe's played in a weaker league than Haaland - yes, because he's 39 not 24\nMessi hasn't played as many games that season - that's his fault for not getting picked or not being fit enough\n\nIt's 2024 and Zagorakis still owns Penaldo\n\nMessi, 2 times WC MVP, 2 times Copa MVP\n\nModric, WC MVP with Croatia\n\nForlan, WC MVP with Uruguay\n\nZagorakis, Euro MVP with Greece\n\nBernardo Silva with Portugal, Nations Cup MVP\n\n\n\nPendu 0 MVP in 5 WCs+6 Euros+Nations Cup, but but Messiü§£üòÇ\n\nNot really tho. You have to be ready, fit and be selected for the games. That's not Ronaldos fault Messi wasn't that comes in to play when speaking about anyone beating Ronaldos record I'm afraid you have to be fit enough and be good enough to play week in week out. \n\nYou can't just say oh Messi didn't beat his record beacuse he didn't play as many games that season. That just doesn't work I'm afraid. \n\nMessi played plenty of games in his 1st season for PSG and his numbers were very poor it's the same thing.\n\nready and fit penaldo\n\n0 WC knockout goal in 5 WCs\n\n3 goals in 21 knockout games in 5 WCS + 6 Euros\n\n0 MVP award in 5 WCs + 6 Euros\n\nlmaaaaoooo...\n\nHaaland has literally scored more goals than Ronaldo at the same age. We can debate whether he'll be able to keep up his form, but haaland is on track to pass Ronaldo.\n\nThis record will 100% be beaten, because that what happens to world record: they always get beaten. We can argue whether it will be haaland or someone else, we can argue if it will happen in the next 10, 20 or 50 years, but I guarantee that by 2100 we will have a new world record\n\nBeing on track to do it and actually doing it are 2 different things\n\nDon't be thick, you are missing his point. If he doesn't do it, another one better, and fitter will come in the next years, everything keeps getting better (fitness, technique, playing conditions, etc).\n\nDon't be thick hahaha what an insult. I mean yes you are actually right someone will come and do it, like they said someone will come and knock Ronaldo and Messi off the top and that oh wait no old age beat them didn't it. \n\nDo you actually want a list of every player that's been said since Ronaldo and Messi who the next player to be the best for 10+ years is going to be, half of them no longer play even tho Ronaldo and Messi still do. \n\nOr how about a list of players with the consistency that's needed to match Ronaldo and Messi beacuses that's very easy to give you, 1 player comes to mind who's been just as consistent for the last few years now and that's Salah for Liverpool. \n\nSomeone will come along and score 1,000,000 million goals won't they..\n\nProbably already playing in Sunday League\n\n\"Cristiano Ronaldo‚Äôs 17 Former Teammates Who Declared Lionel Messi as the GOAT\"\n\n  \n[https://sportsbrief.com/football/53976-17-cristiano-ronaldos-teammates-declared-lionel-messi-goat/](https://sportsbrief.com/football/53976-17-cristiano-ronaldos-teammates-declared-lionel-messi-goat/)\n\nand we have clowns trying to cope here, lmaaaooo..\n\nDude...\n\nWhen players are young they aren't as prolific. Ronaldo wasn't either.\n\nHaaland is a pure goalscorer so he is capable of it if he plays for as long as Ronaldo has. Also depends if he is willing to drop down to a rubbish league in his final few seasons to keep the goals flowing.\n\nThere's one factor you're not considering. Ronaldo never aimed for 1000 goals until recently. \n\nYoung players are now aiming for it. Every generation a new bar is set and the next generation works hard to break it.\n\nDon't really get why me not considering Ronaldo aiming for 1,000 l goals untill recently is really relevant. \n\nHe's at where he's at, at the age he is which is just dawn right impressive. \n\nHe's scored more goals post 30 then he did before he was 30.  \n\nIn 2014 Ronaldo wasn't the top scorer in any category \n\nAll Comps\nInternational top scorer\nCL top scorer\nEuro top scorer\nClub world cup top scorer\n\nIn 2024 he holds the record in every category now\nIn 2014 he was 29 so he's done all that in the last 10 years\n\nYoung players can aim all they want for his numbers it'll be like us trying to reach the moon\n\nIf Haaland plays a few seasons in a pub league at the end of his career he's absolutely smashing that.\n\nThat really just emphasis the greatness of CR7 really doesn't it if Haaland would have to play in a pub league. When being compared to a man who's scored more goals after the age of 30 than be did before.\n\nYou are a bit lacking in logical thinking. Let that sink in\n\nThis might be news to some people but Ronaldo is not normal. Like mentally he is not normal. Hes borderline obsessed and Im here for it. GOAT.\n\nMessi is the goat dummy\n\nPuta Barca\n\nPUTA BARCA PUTA BARCA OEH OEH\n\nThe goat of taka kaka titi and uefalona.\n\nClown get lost\n\nMessi fanboi\n\nStick to having your mash potato head glued to mobile games.\n\nStick to being a dumb fuck also applies to everyone downvoting the truth clowns\n\nHow many goals in World Cup ?\n\nOnly player to score in 5 world cups, let that insane stat sink in\n\nLots\n\nHe‚Äòs going for 1000 ain‚Äòt he?\n\nThe number of sour messi fans is too damn high\n\nno stopping til 1000\n\nUnbelievable Jeff\n\nHeard my ex say this about a million times. Correct contexts ?\n\nPele scored hattrick tonight\n\nRonaldo still scoring, meanwhile Rooney is years retired and getting praise for scoring in an exhibition game.¬† Rooney is younger than Ronaldo.¬†\n\nüêê\n\nWishing him to reach 1000\n\nI always love how they specify about being a man, like there is a dog somewhere with 1130 goals¬†\n\nWomen also play football.\n\nThat‚Äôs awesome¬†\n\n1000 loading...........\n\nOK!!\n\nPele punching the air rn\n\n1000 isn't that far for him. Icing on the cake will be if he can score his 1000th goal for Portugal and not for his Saudi club.\n\nSo, yeah, by this record,\nHe will play for another 2 season, get 1000 goal, and retire after world cup\n\nHe won‚Äôt play America WC because of the grape allegations, they don‚Äôt like him\n\nThe GOAT\n\nHe‚Äôll still never be Messi\n\nHe's better.\n\nPessi could never\n\nOne of the greats\n\nAnd how many of those he has scored in saudi league?\n\n68, or 7.5%.\n\n7.5% is crazy stat padding\n\ndoes it really matter his 800th goal was against arsenal in the prem at 36\n\nI do know he hasn't won any prizes in that league\n\nI known cr7 is no westbrook but these records seems as meaningless as westbrooks trible double seasons.\n\nFound the Argentina fanboy\n\nLiterally is the equivalent of what Bron did but sure."

    "all_comment_text": "I'm a referee. I didn't watch the game, but one clip got posted to a referee group I'm in.\n\nReferee called a foul and started showing a yellow card to a US player. He took out the card and just raised it above his head, when the other team then took a quick free kick. The referee then lowered the card and signaled advantage and allowed play to continue. The other team then got a good scoring opportunity from the quick free kick.\n\nThis is actually forbidden in the laws and very amateurish. We were all shocked he allowed this or doesn't seem to know the law.\n\nRelevant law:\n\n&gt; Once the referee has decided to caution or send off a player, play must not be restarted until the sanction has been administered, unless the non-offending team takes a quick free kick, has a clear goal-scoring opportunity **and the referee has not started the disciplinary sanction procedure**.\n\nThere were a lot of questionable things he did before this moment, but nothing wildly out of the ordinary, just maybe a ref having a bad day. This moment with the yellow card I think is where nearly everyone experienced in football started asking how this official got to be a center in Copa America instead of the local sunday league\n\nWell there was when Tyler Adams got a yellow card after not touching anybody and getting studs to his own ankle. That was definitely more than ‚Äúquestionable‚Äù\n\nI have seen red given in the similar situations (not that I agree) for the opposing player.\nIn this case the Uruguayan player movement after clearing the ball should have been considered dangerous or reckless or both. Not Adam's.\n\nIt just occurred to me - why wasn‚Äôt this reviewed as a possible red card by VAR to fix?  They would have screwed that up too but it would have been a chance to fix it.\n\nYou can see it was a bad day at the office for the ref. He didn't perform well.\n\nThat I can by because he was so far away. Watching real time I thought Adams was the guilty party.\n\nIf this happened in my local Sunday league I would lose my shit and probably be sent off.\n\nI know I was saying he shouldn‚Äôt be calling the Copa with so little international experience. Call the lesser international tournaments and friendlies before getting the most important tournament for the confederation.\n\nSee but a ref having a bad results in bad calls both ways, having all the bad calls towards one side only would suggest something else, i mean no way is south american soccer is corrupt, never would happen.\n\nI think the KGB is infiltrating the refereeing bodies.\n\nThat was debatable if it was even in the top 3 worst decisions that game\n\nThere was so much questionable shit, this official should never touch a senior level international match again. Send him to the Sunday leagues to learn the basics, in my opinion.\n\n[deleted]\n\nI'm sure there were other questionable calls but this stands out to me because it's black and white. Things like fouls, offside offenses, etc. can be subjective (even if clear). But there is no grey area at all for this example.\n\nDid they restart with a free kick for Uruguay or a throw in?\n\nI'm curious if he got confused with the guideline to let it play and then sort it out with the VAR. \n\nI mean, in both cases it would be really bad.\n\nThey restarted with a throw in after ream cleared it, so the ref was fine with the quick restart while he had his card out\n\nYeah, that's really bad...\n\nMaybe I‚Äôm not understanding properly but does this law here not state exactly what happened? They kicked a quick free kick and had a scoring opportunity? Or am I missing something\n\nHe stopped play to start disciplinary action. Which means play can't continue until finished and referee blows for a restart.\n\nYou can‚Äôt take a free kick when the ref is awarding a yellow or warning a player. I think the official term for what‚Äôs required is an ‚Äúorchestrated restart‚Äù\n\nIt's unofficially referred to as a ceremonial restart.\n\nWhat _should_ happen is the ref just lets play go on and then on the next stoppage, produce a card and make a record. \n\nWhat _should not_ happen is pull out a card, see the players play on, scramble your card back into your pocket and then follow the players as they continue play. The ref is in charge, not Uruguay.\n\nThe restart happened wayyyy ahead of where the foul occurred. You shouldn‚Äôt allow a quick restart like that even if he hadn‚Äôt started issuing the yellow card.\n\nRead the very last part of that sentence. \nThat‚Äôs what you‚Äôre missing.\n\nHe blew the whistle and people stopped playing. It was wild.\n\nGood take but you got one thing wrong. The ref didn‚Äôt even lower the card before playing advantage. There are screenshots of him sprinting forward with both arms up playing advantage, with the card still in his hand. It was comically bad to watch real time.\n\nDoes the ref have to blow the whistle to start the play again??\n\nIt's not required by law but that's generally how it's communicated, yes.\n\nBoth USA and Mexico had some sketchy ass refs. However, both teams underperformed and didn't really deserve to move forward. Very disappointing week for Concacaf\n\nCanada made it out of their much tougher group though üíÄ\n\nPlaying up a man almost the entirety of both important games and scoring 1 goal isnt the flex you think it is\n\nFlex? Im not even Canadian man. Fact is that you mfs got eliminated by Panama.\n\nYou lost to Panama ü§°\n\nDon‚Äôt ever @ us¬†\n\nNot like us\n\nAnd not even dominating the other one then\n\nVs Peru even when a man ahead they got dominated and lucky that it ended 1-0\n\nVs Chile it was a bit better but at best it would have been even\n\nI knew they were serious after watching them play against Argentina.¬†\n\nIts the only good game they had so far lmao\n\nYou are right about that.\n\nThe game could have ended 5-0 Argentina. Easily. Not that Mexico (my country) would have done any better. I'm glad we didn't go through cause Argentina would have destroyed us for the 10th time.\n\nthey looked terrible though. only did so because of reds in their matches. also canada got lucky not getting an obvious red early on themselves in the last game\n\nAfter the ref pretended to not see an elbow to the face of a chilean player, panicking and expelling a Chilean player, all in the first 15 minutes of the game.\n\nUS looked very good up until around the 20th minute, when the ref's bullshit shenanigans started. We had start-stop play for about 10-15 minutes, and got about half the added time we should have had. The US had a LOT taken out of them by the referee slowing the game down, booking Adams on some bullshit, and giving Uruguay the green light to play overly aggressive. \n\nThe referee handed Uruguay a massive life line. They understandably took it so don't think this is a dig at them, more just that the official had a significant impact on the tempo of the game early on, and it was to Uruguay's direct and obvious benefit.\n\nI hate the narrative going around that the US didn't \"deserve\" it and played poorly. They absolutely did not, and had Uruguay scrambling early on. That shit ass ref 100% changed the outcome with their decisions and overall handling of the game. Shameful, and it's even more shameful that his performance is being overlooked by this narrative that the US didn't play well.\n\nOooh boooy.¬†\n\nClearly no one in this thread watched the game. It was the worst officiating I‚Äôve ever seen by a mile. If you read the article Pulisic readily admits that they are out of the tournament due to poor play, not officiating.\n\nWatching the game? Reading the article? Why do that when you can just read twitter headlines all day?\n\nRead?  Pffff, just watch TikToks\n\nTikToks made by someone who also didn‚Äôt read the article or watch the match but rather browsed twitter and Reddit for a bit\n\nPfff, I only listen to Trump! That‚Äôs my only source for facts.\n\nI don‚Äôt even know why I‚Äôm on here I‚Äôm switching back over to truth social now\n\nI watched the game.  I've watched all the Copa games.  In a tournament of terrible officiating,  this game takes the cake.  And that takes into account a Canadian getting headbutted without a call, it being reviewed by VAR for violent conduct, and still not punished.\n\n\nBy the numbers:\n\n\nThe yellow card/dead ball debacle.\n\n\nTyler Adam's being stepped on high on the ankle (potential red for the offender) and Adams getting the yellow. \n\n\nNo advantage played on handballs(x2)\n\n\nThe goal that wasn't,  maybe?\n\n\nLet me say, the US didn't look like a 11 ranked team in this tournament.   They didn't look like a top 50 team.  That said, every call that could be made, even in the US favor, it seemed, was made to slow them down.  The contrast in allowing Uruguay to play fast on a yellow card stoppage but not play advantage on a handball when the US was away on a break was very stark.  Conmebal can only make so many excuses for their referees being so terrible.\n\n&gt;I watched the game.\n\nBased on this comment I'm going to conclude that was a lie. The first 25 minutes of the game was US players being mauled without even fouls given, much less yellow cards.\n\nYes, it was clear from the first 15 minutes the agenda of the ref.\n\n&gt;If you read the article Pulisic readily admits that they are out of the tournament due to poor play, not officiating.\n\nPoor play against Panama. This game should have been ceremonial and more of an exhibition, but they fucked up against Panama, mostly due to Weah's insanely stupid red. In this game, the US looked genuinely good, and had Uruguay scrambling early on. Only after this official's bullshit started did Uruguay finally get a grip on the game.\n\nBecause he was the worst ref I‚Äôve ever seen\n\nYou did not watch 2002 world cup?\n\nI did but at my age have no recollection\n\nThis could mean you were very young or you're very old...\n\nHe was there for Uruguay winning in 1950\n\nbyron moreno. i will never forget his name\n\nnever, not ever. corrupt as heck, and I've never said that about any other match.\n\nSpain Korea. Worst game of all time.\n\nYou mean Italy Korea. That team could have gone to the final in the right conditions. Was an insanely stacked team but unfortunately not quite right yet.\n\nAs a lifelong Spain fan, thinking about that game still makes the bile rise up in my throat. I will never get over the bitterness I felt after that match.\n\nYou've obviously never seen Wilton Perreira Sampaio\n\nRefereeing been on point compared to previous Copa America's. US wanted part of this, well the corruption of LATAM comes with it white bois\n\nThis tournament is being held in our country, under our jurisdiction. There's nothing stopping the USA from investigating the refereeing crew and the sanctioning bodies and FA's. We can want to play with yall without wanting the corruption that comes with it.\n\nFinal is Argentina v Brasil whether the US complains or not.\n\nDon't make me laugh ü§£\n\nMy old coach from Liverpool once told me ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt rely on the refs because they‚Äôre shit‚Äù\n\nPulisic is right because the ref was honestly beyond shit and at least he mentioned the bad play from the team itself in the Copa.\n\nRef was dog shit. But it shouldn't have mattered. WE shouldn't have lost to Panama, we should have beat Panama. Weah freaking out, Gregg's shit tactics, all that added up to kill our chances to advance. \n\nIt was easily the worst reffed high level match I've seen, like I think the average high school ref would have done a better job.\n\nYeah. The announcers were talking all about how horrible his officiating was. The US still needs some work to become champions, but that ref was definitely very inexperienced. I don‚Äôt see him keeping his job very long.\n\nSome work to become champions? Mate, they are miles away from any title that isn't the gold cup\n\nThey wouldn‚Äôt have won that game with any ref. 0.56 expected goals is atrocious in a game you needed to win. Yeah he sucked. Who cares. Made like 3 good connections in the final 1/3\n\nTruth is we have absolutely no idea how different the match would‚Äôve played out under a competent ref. It‚Äôs difficult to get into a rhythm when the play stops every 5 minutes for injuries, many of which likely could‚Äôve been avoided if the referee controlled the game. It would also be virtually impossible for US players to be in the right headspace when they feel like they‚Äôre playing against the referee as much as they are against Uruguay.\n\nThe ref, the coach, the pitch. Does it ever get exhausting blaming everyone but the players? Our youth system sucks, and they‚Äôre 4th or 5th tier athletes at best. Not exactly rocket science why they continue to struggle\n\nHaha that is some wild mental logistics to avoid anything other than US being crap\n\nThere is a need for the US to get a new coach.\n\nPulisic is right in this case. I support üá≤üáΩ\n\nSame. There were multiple calls that made me yell what at the screen\n\nNo player from his team can be happy about such performance.¬†\n\nUSA soccer is so uninspiring\n\nI could imagine the scenes if a European coach was worried about letting his team know the score of another game, instead of focusing on defending the free kick. Shows the winning mentality is not there, even with somewhat decent talent\n\nThat type of mentality wouldn‚Äôt fly in any other American sports. It is laughable we put up with it regarding the USMNT. A very unserious footballing nation.\n\nThe leniency the USSF gets because they only matter once every 4 years\n\nHe would already be fired by any serious football federation\n\nDa fuck is this take? This is done very often, it helps the team understand what needs to be done\n\nIt is not done very often at all. There is always a path to progress. The US had a very clear path to surviving the group throughout and they simply failed.\n\nI‚Äôve always heard successful teams say ‚Äúwe‚Äôre only worried about what we can control‚Äù and certainly never play for a draw\n\nVery often? In football? I genuinely can't remember any instance of this.\n\nGroup stages games.\n\n\nDecisive League games.\n\n\nAre 2 of the most common ones\n\nSo you don't have any concrete example?\n\nOur women's team is still good\n\n2010 was inspiring but we‚Äôve yet to replicate a moment like that IMO.\n\nUS can only blame themselves but the reffing in the 3rd game was dog shit. Need a coach with experience outside of NA\n\nRef was very poor, but so was losing to Panama. Can‚Äôt feel too bad for them\n\nPanama also played incredibly dirty. Don‚Äôt know why weah hit that guy but it wasn‚Äôt for no reason. Then we‚Äôre down a man and they injured our goalkeeper. Nasty, dirty fouls the entire game were being allowed. This tournament is a farce after that poorly called game and especially the Uruguay game and it‚Äôs horrible ref\n\nWelcome to the Copa America? The reffs have always been fucking garbage lol.\n\nImagine if Uruguay had scored on the self allowed restart during that yellow card. The ref also would blow the whistle 5-10 seconds late on multiple advantages for the US. The team played poorly but that referee was in over his head and will hurt officiating future games for any team.\n\nI'm with Murica on this one. The ref was fucking awful. How do you give a yellow AND give advantage? And the goal was pretty questionable.\n\nAmerica #1 at losing baby! Canada had a harder group and 1/10th the population moved on and they didn‚Äôt üòÇ\n\nmy boys scored 1 goal in 3 matches and moved on! üá®üá¶üëçüèºüòÜ\n\nYup! Also just tied France, not bad for a small arctic country\n\nIt's like 100 degrees here in Canada, where i am closer to florida than to the arctic circle. Hard to think of us as arctic when none of us live in the arctic.\n\nPssst, fellow Canadian...don't say it's 100¬∞F in Canada, tell him it's 37.8¬∞ C and it'll blow his mind.\n\nGood thing the US let Jesse Marsch go to you guys and kept Gregg‚Ä¶\n\nUp the nucks\n\nDude, the stupid referee let that defender punch our player (Chilean here) and went without fault! Not even the stupid VAR kicked in!!!\n\nAgreed with that. I feel for you. Every game I‚Äôve watched the reffing has been poor. Should have been a red. \n\nLater I saw a Chilean player slide and hand ball a cross while at the top of the box a Canadian was body checked with no call on either. \n\nAgainst Peru we got a head butt to the face and similarly no review or even yellow card. \n\nReally disappointed in everything so far.\n\nMeanwhile, in the Euro cup the referees are spot on flawless!!!\n\nWhere the Stanley cup living these days?\n\nUsing the stanley cup for leverage is a terrible excuse. You and I both know its Canadian players that win it for American teams most of the time.\n\nThis year it was mainly Europeans that pulled through for Florida\n\nOh relax, it's a chirp.\n\nCopeeee yaaa lossserrrr\n\nTnx to Weah too, they are out. Got such a stupid red card in a match that could've earned them knockout phase\n\nI mean ... cant blame him, ref was horrible .... buuuuuuuuut ... he didnt lost them this tournament.\n\nGood thing that‚Äôs exactly what he said. Ref was weird, not why they lost.\n\nNah they were horrible the whole tournament the officiating has made me stopped watching.\n\nAll pulisic has ever done is moan and blame everything else. I haven‚Äôt seen it yet, it might well be shady on the refs part but what I have seen is years of pulisic crying out loud\n\nIf you actually read the article, you would see he didn‚Äôt blame losing on the ref. Stop being an idiot and taking headlines at face value\n\nI‚Äôm not claiming he‚Äôs blaming the ref I‚Äôm stating the fact that for the best part of the last four years he‚Äôs cried more times than he‚Äôs scored. He did it at Chelsea he‚Äôs doing it at ac and oh did he just do it with the national team. What a wanker I am for pointing that out hey.\n\nThey lost the group in the game against Panama. Not worthy of being captain.\n\nIt‚Äôs his fault another player got a straight red early in the game?\n\nSure- but that was Weah's fault for letting the emotions get the best of him and getting a straight red. \n\nGranted thats ironic being that the picture above is him yelling at the ref.\n\nI'd have yelled at the ref too if he allowed a blatant offsides goal to count as well.\n\nThat is true, and the referee errors didn‚Äôt impact the US going through, that doesn‚Äôt mean there were not serious errors by the referee.\n\nThat‚Äôs just not true. The refereeing in all three games was egregious and majorly impacted each game. Uruguay‚Äôs goal was blatantly offside. This isn‚Äôt exclusive to US games. CONMEBOL needs to do better for these players. It‚Äôs an embarrassment.\n\nBut what about VAR?\n\nWhat do you mean? They called it wrong. I don‚Äôt care how long they looked at it it‚Äôs clear and obvious offside.\n\nI mean, they did impact the US going thru in the Panama game.  US still played poorly and Weah made a massive mistake, but the ref absolutely contributed as well.  That's part of the game though, you can't control the officiating and you do the best you can regardless.\n\nAlmost a young 72\n\nAverage CONMEBOL ref\n\nI don't blame him. To signal advantage after giving a yellow card is incredibly amateurish. Then to not shake Pulisics hand gives a very unprofessional tone. He should be investigated even if the result stands.\n\nThe major Karen still at it\n\nThere‚Äôs Messi, then Ronaldo, Then Pulisic‚Ä¶ üíÄü§£\n\nThe drama of this tournament should show all of the Americas  that their honor, standards, acumen, and ability to govern soccer are all in question. Everyone involved looks corrupt and weak, and obviously a byproduct of years of FIFA corruption doing nothing to govern the game in proper ways.\n\nBrings back memories of Korea vs Italy WC 2002\n\nEx players should be refs.\n\nHonestly speaking, that was a poor performance from the referee for that match.\n\nDon't lose to Panama then...\n\nSaw how he was hacked down versus Panama üáµüá¶ and the player was not even going for the ball at all‚Ä¶ my conclusion after watching quite a few copa matches: South American football is in a league of its own man, the tackles are so out of this world.. it‚Äôs like a drug cartel fighting another cartel‚Ä¶out to kill\n\nthat was truly the worst officiated match i've ever seen\n\nFIFA doing FIFA things\n\nThe ref is paid off maybe üòÇ\n\nThis referee doesn‚Äôt know the rules, how can be rulling in cupa??!!\n\nIt looked like the ref really had it out against the US or he had a nice amount of money to be made if US lost.\n\nJoin the club. Last couple of seasons with VAR have been a rollercoaster of negativity\n\nIt doesn‚Äôt matter HOW we played. Did we play shit? Yes. But they had an unfair advantage and it COULD‚ÄôVE been a draw. Us being shit isn‚Äôt an excuse for poor officiating and vice versa.\n\nUruguay and rigging games, whats new?\n\nThe reffing has been very suspicious in this tournament\n\nGo check the refs IG page. Dude thinks he‚Äôs a star. That‚Äôll sum up all of this\n\nGot nobody to blame but themselves‚Ä¶.and Weah\n\nCan‚Äôt accept your teams play anymore.\n\nGarbage ref should be taken out back. Needs to be investigated for sports betting or cp\n\nMy man needs a chill pill üòÖ\n\nPulisic played like trash. The ref sucked but we sucked more\n\nThose *soccer* referees...amiright?!!\n\nPulisic deserved a yellow card against Panama. He got fouled hard. When he stood up he went a shoved the Panama player to the ground in front of the ref. Nothing happened.\n\nNot a great look for us.\n\nCurrently watching the Euro championship and Copa. The quality of officiating in Copa is laughable. Did we see the Venezuelan keeper, impeding a throw-in? That was a straight yellow card, a Canadian player, got head-butted, that should have been a Red card. It's really bad\n\nUS was trash before the tournament now they want to blame it on the refs ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ bad refereeing is part of this tournament. Can‚Äôt handle the heat get out of the kitchen. USA soccer bribing CONMEBOL to have the South American championship in North America‚Ä¶.fuck me.\n\nI mean this was being billed as a breakthrough tournament from us with our best players coming of age. Instead, it was a massive step back. We shouldn‚Äôt have been in the position to be grouped by that point. \n\nPulisic never should‚Äôve retracted the comment that they needed to play the ‚Äúbest game of their lives‚Äù against Uruguay because it was true after what happened against Panama. Shows the team isn‚Äôt inspired to win.\n\nArsehole of a ref refused to shake his hand at the end. I‚Äôve never seen that happen before.\n\nI mean‚Ä¶ it was right after he told them to go celebrate with Uruguay‚Ä¶ lol\n\nPulisic was lucky he wasn't sent off for his behaviour. I wouldn't shake that twats hand either\n\nThat's the difference between football and soccer\n\nThey still would have lost with the calls.  \n\nSure you can blame the refs, but that is just brushing aside the terrible playing.\n\nUruguay had some terrible calls made against them too.  Its easy to play victim when home.\n\nplease elaborate\n\nI mean if his goal is bringing to light poor refereeing, it‚Äôs probably best to wait a day or two so as to not sound like sour grapes.  It‚Äôs a concern because this ref was goofy bad (that quick restart on the yellow was insane) but I just don‚Äôt want to hear a player talking about refs so soon after a loss.\n\nAs for not losing because of the refs, duh, the team played awful.  It was like they had never played together, and at times, had barely played above high school club level.  So many ridiculously rough touches with no one with in 3-5 yards.  I‚Äôd also say a lot of this team needs to stop putting themselves in position first significant LEGAL contact if they can‚Äôt handle, because they just seem like they‚Ä¶CAN‚ÄôT‚Ä¶handle it.\n\nWe all want better refs.  We all want players to stop diving and faking injuries.  We all want lots of stuff.  ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\n\nXavi and Klopp are both unemployed as of now\n\nU.S. making excuses again\n\nLets be real even with competent refs the USA wasn't going to dominate the knockout stage. I believe the vast majority of the blame is on Weah for being enough of an idiot to get a red card so early and lose them that game. However, when I saw the ref giving a Yellow card to Weston Mckennie and then suddenly allow the Uruguayans to surge forward and get a scoring opportunity, I just started laughing out loud at how absurd it was. Total amateur. I have less than 50 hours referring low level games and even I instantly recognized how wrong it was\n\nIt **was** offsides.  There is no debate.  Folks continuing to intimate that it wasn't are either being disingenuous, have not seen a proper angle, or just don't know what they are talking about.  That said, Pulisic is absolutely correct.  If you only generate 3-4 chances, you are going to have a bad time.  If you have a player act like a petulant child in the first portion of a match and get sent off, you are going to have a bad time.  If you have a coach that is more about vibes than values, you are going to have a bad time.\n\nCan you show me the proper angle? I have not seen something that proves it was the wrong call.¬†\n\nThe proper angle is obviously the one that fits his narrative.\n\nIt was a very close call. It might have been very slightly offside but like you said nothing so obvious that the call can be proven wrong. Had it been the other way around (US goal disallowed when it was this close), the outcry would have been just as large, probably larger.\n\nI did not watch the game, maybe the ref really was unfair - but people taking this offside call as proof for that make me think it might just be butthurt fans...\n\nI understand your perspective, but having watched the match with my wife's family, even the Spanish-speaking commentators were shocked at the offside call. \n\nWhilst the US certainly didn't do themselves any favours and didn't deserve to advance, that doesn't negate the questionable officiating we witnessed. As a neutral observer, I can say the frustrations weren't just fan overreaction - there were genuine concerns about the referee's impartiality.\n\n[https://brobible.com/sports/article/uruguay-goal-offside-usmnt-copa-america-match/](https://brobible.com/sports/article/uruguay-goal-offside-usmnt-copa-america-match/)\n\nMighty bold talk for someone who didn't even watch the match.  Also, that \"narrative\" line is pure bullshit.  That is called poisoning the well, for those unfamiliar with logical fallacies.\n\n[https://brobible.com/sports/article/uruguay-goal-offside-usmnt-copa-america-match/](https://brobible.com/sports/article/uruguay-goal-offside-usmnt-copa-america-match/)\n\nEdit: So as to avoid the \"just google it, man\" crap, I have provided you with a link.\n\nSo two pictures that use the wrong frame where the ball already left his head and one picture that shows a really close situation. I can believe that it would've been offside with the semi automated tech but with the used system it seems like the right call\n\nI knew it was off when I watched it, as anyone who has ever watched swimming on television knows exactly how deceiving camera angles can be.  That is the case here.  It is all academic anyway.  We didn't exit the tournament because of the officials, even though they **were** poor.   Our players didn't perform and that is it.  But, that goal should not have been given.\n\nHe's completely right evene the announcers agree and I'm sure most other teams do too.\n\n[deleted]\n\nDid you read the article at all?  He blames poor play for the US exit not officiating but states that he saw the refs make calls he had never seen before and that are out of line with officiating globally.\n\nIf you blame a referee when you lose 1 - 0 you're probably just crap\n\nMaybe you should read the article\n\nBerhalter was letting the team know the score of the other game in the group and to play for a tie because of it.\n\nAh the England way of exiting at the group stage.\n\nDon‚Äôt think Southgate would even do that"

Are they dumb?\n\nGames back\n\nBe off to the place of the fucks, yankee\n\nYour mom‚Äôs home?\n\nCR: How can I make this all about ***me***\n\n\\*sighs\n\n  \n\\*checks scj\n\nI feel like he took this as his last hope for winning something this season and he almost did it but still failed, I can understand that but man you still get a Euro Championship to play and you already cried this hard after losing a Saudi cup.\n\nI know he‚Äôs an athlete and part of me respects that he cares and has this raw ambition to win *but* I just can‚Äôt take the Saudi league seriously from a competitive standpoint and a political standpoint. Clubs owned by heirs and family of monarchs.\n\nIts just the next Chinese Super League.\n\n98% of the world just dgaf, and in a few years it‚Äôll be irrelevant once Ronaldo retires.\n\nThis is what I used to think, but I was in Morocco last month and it was absolutely massive there. I think people in west underestimate how popular the league is in Muslim countries and if they keep recruiting washed up big name Europeans + young Arabic talent I think the league can do pretty well. I‚Äôll never watch it,  but that doesn‚Äôt mean no one will.\n\nI mean people forget that the league actually has history and that Al-Hilal is the most successful team in Asian competitions(8 ACL titles). The big clubs already had big fan bases in Saudi too.\n\nIn authoritarian regimes, I've read, supporting a team (usually a football team) is the only means of experiencing large gatherings, and expressing support for or against something. So it's one of the few ways of being openly tribal or lightly political.\n\nSo are you a particular authoritarian regime? Or do you represent all of them in general?\n\n[deleted]\n\nIt's not about organizing another or even making plans to do anything like that. \n\nIn communist countries there were certain clubs that were favored by different parts of the government, eg. There was an army team, a police team, etc. Other teams were there to make up the numbers. \n\nActively supporting your own team that was playing against a state favored team was really the only way you could show even a little bit of dissent. \n\nAlso see the history of Barcelona and Real Madrid during Franco in Spain.\n\nIs it so popular? I read that for like 90% of games the stadiums are pretty much empty, only for the top games someone shows up. \n\nEven the averages are horrible. Like 6,000 people showing up on average in stadiums for 30-40,000 people.\n\nIf it was so popular, why don't people show up in the stadiums?\n\nAmong western Muslim population it may be popular right now because it is something \"new\" and currently they really \"purchased\" a lot of top players. But give it 2-3 more years and that hype will probably die down again.\n\nHe meant TV viewership idiot.¬†\n\nMany takes on Reddit come moreso from a Eurocentric point of view.\n\nMy local kebab shop sometimes has it on... quality is awful, like so incredibly bad. Second dutch ligue bad... stadiums look 10% full at the very best...\n\nIt's a flop bro. Don't even try to hype it up\n\nWith the money the Saudis have I‚Äôm not so sure. They can dwarf an entire club‚Äôs salary for one player. Maybe in 25 or 30 years they‚Äôll be one of the top leagues, which I really hope not. Another alternative is they continue buying clubs around the world and then own half of Serie A or the Prem.\n\nThey will buy players, but really, can they buy a bigger name than Ronaldo? I feel right now not many people watch the games of the Saudis league\n\nWym? Brotha, they offered twice the contract size of Ronaldo to both Mbappe and Messi, both of who rejected them.\n\nThey offered 1.5 billion to Messi for 3 years but he rejected.\n\nSure they can, Ronaldo is way past his prime and they still threw money at him like crazy.\n\nI‚Äôm afraid slowly and steadily some good players will leave just for the money as we‚Äôre already starting to see. Some won‚Äôt adjust though, such as Henderson!\n\nBigger *name* player. There‚Äôs no bigger name player over ronaldo excluding Messi\n\nThey can‚Ä¶. but will they? This time last season the press was full of stories about which players were signing and for how much, must have been unofficial leaks because almost all of the stories ended up being accurate. This summer so far? Well, there have been a couple of very speculative stories ‚ÄòEderson might be approached‚Äô being the biggest one, but nothing at all about big fees, big names etc.¬†\n\nIts making me wonder if the Saudi league could be ‚Äòone and done‚Äô and the fact that spending big last summer achieved nothing but negative press might see the ending of their ambitions¬†\n\nWell, at least the oil is not infinite.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5005205/2023/10/28/henderson-saudi-pro-league-crowds/\n\nThere was a game this year with 133 spectators‚Ä¶\n\nMoney is not the reason people love football. Look at Man City. They have bought incredible success but still nobody gives a fuck about them. \n\nPeople tell stories about heroics performed against the odds.  Local boys made good. Giant killings by plucky underdogs.  Nobody talks about Man City players the same way they talk about beautiful players of the game - Modric, Zidane, Ronaldinho or Pirlo.  \n\nYou can buy success, but you can‚Äôt buy the respect of lovers of football. \n\nSaudi League will be irrelevant soon, just as u/deisidaimonia said.\n\nWell our generation. But the kids 6-15 wear either city, psg or madrid shirt. Its crazy.\n\n Also their mistake/ problem is thay are giving massive salaries to old players. They should be scouting in south america africa and hige huge salary to young prospexts to steal them drom\nEuropa\n\nTbf we don't have to take it seriously but for him it's proving he can dominate that level as a 39 year old I guess. He's probably accepted he can't compete/dominate in a European league any more, but he likely wants to prove he's still good enough at a step down. It's just an ego thing. It's like how academy players want to prove themselves at these U21, U18 etc competitions eventhough it means nothing to most fans and the level isn't comparable to adult football. Footballers still compete and experience the emotions because it's relative to the stage they're at in their career.\n\nSounds a bit like the premier league tbh\n\nI remember one of his first games there he scored four goals. The defending one some of them was woeful. They're literally letting Cristiano Ronaldo jog through them unmarked, running at their box without any resistance.\n\nAnd apparently that, to his die-hard fans, was proof he could still dominate the prem.\n\nMost probably it was the first and last game you know\n\nTo be fair to Ronaldo, he did score 18 goals in 30 games for Manchester United in the season prior to him joining Saudi. I'm not denying that he is declining, but he is still better than most PL strikers.\n\nHe did, but United's entire team had to be built around him for a while. We also finished sixth after showing progress the year before to finish 2nd and go far in the cups.\n\nThe next season he got one in ten. That EL game where they kept trying to put it on a plate for him was tough to watch.\n\nLmao, watched one game and judged the entire league and Ronaldo's  performance based on it.\n\nCounterargument. There's bad defense in every league one goal is not enough for you to access a level of a league. \n\nNot arguing that Saudi league is great or anything but some of you act like any player could get there and bag 50 goals when that's not true.\n\nTo be fair to the Chinese super league only collapsed bc of Covid and players who went over like oscar(remember him) is still there so they clearly enjoy the time over there\n\nSo what? It‚Äôs still 22 men on the field against each other trying their best to win a match\n\nThat‚Äôs what I was getting at in the first part. He‚Äôs an athlete and he‚Äôs not going to treat this any differently.\n\nHow is this different from any other league, theres lot of foreign arab/ russian oligarch money in western leagues too. Its not 1960s anymore when local boys won title for celtics.\n\nwill he be playing much in that i could see him sitting on the bench for most of it\n\nThe dont have a chance in hell winning Euros. This is his last chance in obtaining a trophy against camel peddlers. hahahaha\n\nFirst of all, Ronaldo has already conquered Europe by being extremely successful in 3 different top leagues winning all of the top individual and team accolades (except the CL for Juventus). He has won the Ballon D‚Äôor for two different clubs and won a major trophy for his national team that had never won one in it‚Äôs history.\n\nHe is now 39 y/o and playing in a lesser league where he was able to maximize his money. No, he wasn‚Äôt dumb enough to stay in Europe just to sit more than play and get paid less. He is bringing his fame and more exposure to the Saudi League, and it has improved. The deal with Ronaldo is that his haters love to get on their soapbox and talk down whatever he does no matter how dumb it sounds.\n\nRonaldo‚Äôs first full season with Al Nassr saw them post the 2nd best season in their club‚Äôs history while losing Talisca (their 2nd best player) for half the year. Al Hilal was outstanding this year and had the better run. Al Nassr came up short in the AFC CL and King‚Äôs Cup due to penalties. Teammates matter and Ronaldo is all about winning team trophies, not just records and individual accolades. He wants to bring glory to whatever club he joins and being an elite player from Europe doesn‚Äôt guarantee you anything in lesser leagues.\n\nSo, winning in the Saudi League matters to Ronaldo. Not for the BS reasons that haters are saying on here, but for the fact that he is putting in the work at an advanced age. He set the scoring record and will likely be Player of the Year in the SL. That is a great achievement and hopefully his team can win trophies next season. He has done his part and now his teammates need to step up as a unit.\n\nI'd say it's difficult for him to accept that his body is getting to a stage where he cant do what he once could. I suppose nobody can disagree with his ability but his attitude on the pitch is questionable at times...\n\nIt must be difficult to be the guy that can pull your team over the line like almost no-one else, and now he can't do that.\n\nIt must be difficult to be the guy that can pull your team over the line at the very highest club level, and now he can't do that in the Saudi league.¬†\n\nStill 7 goals away from the 900th.  Once he reaches 1000, he will retire\n\nHe still can, did you see how many goals he scored this season, he set a record in the league‚Ä¶\n\nHe did it with United 2 years ago , wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if he still had it\n\nWhat line did he pull united over?\n\nNot being Midtable and getting them out of the ucl group , he was in a shit team , with no service and still managed top 3 in the golden boot race , people still shit on that season when he was carrying that United side\n\nExactly. And it‚Äôs just not even the Premier League, he scored in every game of the group stage of the Champions League except the last game where he did not play.\n\nHe annoyed me by the end but you're not wrong. People complained about his pressing but he would be the only one sprinting after the ball up until the final whistle. It's like huh maybe his stats don't look good for pressing because fucking nobody else is.\n\nThe Europa league line.\n\nI think he scored a few last minute equalisers in games they were losing because they were playing badly due to not being a good cohesive team for‚Ä¶ some reason\n\nHello handsome\n\nI mean didn‚Äôt he score like 35 goals in 32 games that‚Äôs still fairly Ronaldo-esque even if it‚Äôs just at Saudi level\n\nI'm 2 years younger than him and I crippled myself bending over to pick up a t-shirt this morning. Dude's doing alright.\n\nI always wonder how someone like him (and the likes of Brady) will cope with retirement. Will they end up nostalgic Captain Freedom commentator types? Or just sit at home seething they are no longer relevant. Being so focused for so long must be so hard to overcome.\n\nRonaldo already mentioned that he plans to focus on businesses and such based on an interview with Jordan Peterson (who came to see him around the time period where Ronaldo's mental health was low from the death of his child).\n\nAge comes for everyone. He simply cannot accept it. He is not crying because he lost, he is crying because of that.\n\ndamn a mentalist here\n\nYou must know Ronaldo pretty well huh.\n\nIt‚Äôs been happening to him for nearly 10 years. Just keeps finding ways to adapt\n\nI'm sure the ¬£3.4 mil a week wages will soften the blow.\n\nA week? Holy fucking hell\n\nShould‚Äôve came to Mexico instead since he‚Äôs not allowed in USA\n\nWhy can Ronald not go to USA? üò≥\n\nGoogle Ronaldo Las Vegas to learn more\n\nAllegedly raped a girl in a hotel in like 2009?\n\nRead the transcript with his lawyer.... 'allegedly' is to be used loosely or to be honest incorrectly really\n\nI read some parts of that transcript once in some online thread. Fuck, I wanted to vomit. The way rape in football world is being normalised and rapists are not only escaping prison and allowed to go back to their extravagant lives , but also celebrated among fans, is disgusting\n\nNot allegedly. He literally admitted it.\n\nOh no shit? I have no idea lol, I just googled it\n\nHe‚Äôs a dirty rapist\n\nOMG i know some of these guys really want him to be a rapist but at least get your facts straight. \nHe can go to USA. There are no travel ban on him or anything like that. Case against him was dismissed and the judge fined mayorga's lawyer for using evidence obtained from hackers. \nNow if they somehow managed to reopen the case best they can do is detain him for a short time for questioning.\n\nWouldn‚Äôt he be extradited from Mexico anyways?\n\nI mean, he wasn't extradited from Europe, interestingly enough.¬†\n\nI don‚Äôt think so. I googled it. He‚Äôs not a U.S citizen so he would be safe but I could be wrong\n\nclub america would run circles around him\n\nI dont judge people who cry. I dislike him for being a shithole team mate!\n\nThis. It‚Äôs actually quite admirable how competitive he still is and how much it means to him.\n\nJust his antics sometimes make him look ridiculous.\n\nBruh, I agree 100%. I didn't think he would care about the Saudi league.\n\nI know that it is all about money for him now but maybe he should have stayed in a smaller league in Europe - like in Portugal or something. I imagine that he would have been much happier winning one at an old age than where he is now.\n\nWhich competitive team would sign an almost-40 year old striker and offer him first team football. That alone is crazy to even consider and completely nonsensical. Any team that did approach him after his parting from Utd likely didn't offer him first team football or weren't competitive clubs. Imagine Ronaldo playing for Chaves and enjoying it lmao\n\nMaybe he saves Chaves from relegation if he plays there. Safety would have been his trophy.\n\nI‚Äôm Portuguese, naturally Ronaldo is a player who I like and hold dear in respect (I also equally respect Messi), but to me, it seems that Ronaldo extended too much his career.\n\nI know it wouldn‚Äôt have been a great ending of his career in the ending fallout between him and Manchester United, but at this point I think he will drag down Portugal at the Euro 2024.\n\nMaybe he should consider ending it there, independently of the result and the outcome, either positive or negative. He should have finished it on a higher note, and that seemed way before it reached this point. \n\nMaybe he won‚Äôt do much at the Euros, essentially drag down his team and lose everything, or maybe we‚Äôll still be able to win it, I don‚Äôt know, but if he finished it there, it would be the best timing for it of the last couple of years.\n\nI heavily doubt they‚Äôll start him at the Euros. He‚Äôll be an impact player at best\n\nHe‚Äôll start, I already know. We all Portuguese know he‚Äôll start, we got that assurance during those qualifiers. If he doesn‚Äôt start, then we‚Äôll all be surprised.\n\nQuestion is, will he accept that? He has a history of making a fuss when benched\n\nDoes he have a choice lol? Didn‚Äôt make a difference at the World Cup\n\nNot good for the dressing room though\n\nWhy would any footballer cares about \"ending on a high note\". A couple of years playing in saudi league could probably cover for his grandson's entire life all the way until they died bro. Respect the man's grind, it ain't easy being a 40-year-old athlete.\n\nAll these weirdos in the comments who have never played a sport in there life. It is natural to be upset after losing in a competition.\n\nYea fr. Like most here would smash their controller if they lose in fifa but mock ronaldo. Silly kids.\n\nFacts lmao\n\nTrue\n\nBut you gotta love the takes from armchair athletes at least.\n\nThis is why Ronaldo is Ronaldo and the ones saying that are not Ronaldo\n\nYou just can't win with people. He is exhibiting extremely passion and respect for a league we laugh at. That is commendable. He had won it all and he is distraught for him and his team mates.  \n\nCalling him a baby and saying its just a joke league anyway says more bad about you than it does Ronaldo.\n\nSame people saying crap like that are likely the same people who probably threw their controllers or get angry over a match of Fifa. Armchair athletes.\n\nCrying for the potential bonus he could've got\n\nI don't get the hate. I am not a Ronaldo fan and tbh I don't like him that much, but that just shows his passion and love of the game\n\nHe‚Äôs so competitive and has the strongest desire to win\n\nI'm not sure it's fair to say he had a \"brilliant\" individual season when he's playing in a Mickey Mouse league.\n\nbet he's looking at Kroos right now, ending his carreer at the very very top, worshipped by madrid with the Champions league trophy in his hands and everyone somehow hoping he'd do just one more season while he is seemingly stuck in his own football purgatory lol..\n\nHahaha it was always so obvious his ego would eat him alive towards the end of the career. Couldn‚Äôt have happened to someone more deserving.\n\nThis is so weird. On the one hand you have people who complain about players not caring. On the other you have someone that his literally won everything done everything caring and crying about losing a game towards the end of his career in a league no one cares about.\n\nI think it honestly shows his greatness as a competitor and an athlete and it‚Äôs awesome to see. I mean a lot of people thought he would just be collecting a check but competing is just in his dna.\n\nNot the first time Bono makes him cry üòÜ\n\nHis dick has more history than Bono‚Äôs entire bloodline\n\nCrazy to think he almost went to Al hilal\n\nCouldn't cause of a transfer ban\n\nI‚Äôm sure his multi millions in the bank will keep him warm at night\n\nIt‚Äôs kind of wild that of the two of them, Wayne a Rooney is the one that actually grew up.\n\nLooks like he is laughing. Are you sure he isn‚Äôt laughing?\n\nHe didn't finish the season trophyless. He won the Arab Club Campions Cup!\n\nThat's a pre season friendly tournament, even UAFA‚Äôs president said so. Ronaldo hasn't won a single official trophy since May 2021.\n\nI respect this.\n\nNarcissist tears\n\nronaldo look v young in this thumbnail photo\n\nBesides, looking at game events it might have been a surprisingly entertaining game. GK sent off, late equaliser, two more red cards, penalties.\n\nThis to me points to a severe emotional problem that hopefully he‚Äôs getting help with. For someone with his level of achievement, with the minuscule amount of respect that‚Äôs due to the Saudi cup, this shouldn‚Äôt affect him in this way. \n\nThe only understandable explanation is if this is his final game in club football, and he intends to retire after the Euros.\n\nThank you Sigmund\n\n[removed]\n\nWhat do you mean?! Reddit has the greatest armchair athletes and psychiatrists. Any redditor here can easily bag over 35 goals in a single Saudi league!!\n\nIt's normal for men to cry. Men are human beings with emotions. Crying is a normal human trait and expression of emotion.\n\n\"severe emotional problems\" lmao do you call people out for emotional problems when they cry during a movie? Man has a passion and drive that nobody here can even begin to comprehend, especially you. This is the exact same EmOtIoN that pushed his ass into staying hours longer on the practice field than the other kids, and into being one of the greatest of all time. That's all there is to it, Mr. Psychologist.¬†\n\nAnother way of looking at it is that's he's extremely passionate about the sport and winning. And maybe that drive is what made him into one of the greatest of all time. Even close to retirement, that hunger has not gone away.\n\nState of Reddit with these comments lmao\n\nHave you played a sport? Losing is never fun on any level. This is a normal response, given the context.\n\nHow though ? I feel like he just wants to win no matter where he goes, isint that like the basic amount of effort you should be putting in, people are paying so much money to come watch you, the least you can do is give your all, doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs Sunday league level or champions league level out of respect  just for opponent you play at your best and losing sucks\n\nBro you must have mental problems to even type that shii.\n\nfeel for the kid. a hero, always and forever\n\nBesides, looking at game events it might have been a surprisingly entertaining game. GK sent off, late equaliser, two more red cards, penalties.\n\nAl Hilal owns this guy so hard. Bono destroyed his competitive career.\n\nHe cries in advanced to prepare for Euro 2024 üòÇüòÇüòÇ\n\nwhat a baby honestly grow up its not like anyone cares if you win it or not....\n\nHe‚Äôs one of the weirdest people in football‚Ä¶\n\nJoke of a player\n\nDon't care, he is a billionaire. There is children in gaza crying everyday and world doesn't care. They lost their parents and fear death every minutes.\n\nThat‚Äôs hilarious!\n\nReally unfortunate. He could have retired as a legend, like Toni Kroos. But his obsession with stats and Messi brought him to this point.\n\nI mean he's definitely still a legend of the game regardless of what he does over there\n\nI mean he probably did Saudi for the $$$\n\nYeah tbf how was he going to put food on the table otherwise?\n\nHe is still a decent legend though. But yes Tony Kroos and others are mythical legends\n\nA bit silly crying over one of the least important cup competitions in the world\n\nIt's only one of the least important competitions in the world as a spectator. As a player, which ever competitions you play in are the most important, but still, I kinda agree with you\n\nWhat a weirdo honestly\nBeing one of the best players to play the game and then, as a 40 year old man, hysterically crying because you lost a kickabout\n\nA passionate weirdo\n\nHe‚Äôll go home and wipe his tears with all those $$ made from going over there.\n\nHe's crying into his 400million dollars\n\nHe had given his 200% and it still wasn't enough\n\nWow pathetic\n\nI guess he was paid 1 Million / tear\n\nA near 40 year old man acting like this imagine. Mental maturity of a 10 year old. Embarrassing\n\nAthletes are like that. Not a big surprise\n\nHe gets paid 100 mil annually, to justify it He has to act as if he cares.\n\nWhat a bitch\n\nThe Saudi league would be so much better if they properly invested money into all teams in the league, and focused more on Youth Development\n\nRonny just been told that because they lost, no stopping at McDonalds for nuggies\n\nSo what's going to happen now? As usually by chopping the heads off the losers, after signing multiple economic contracts with the EU / US?\n\nI respect this, he still wants to win, even tho it's a Saudi league where others just went for fast money and couldn't care less\n\nAlthough I really like Ronaldo and believe no one will ever be as good as him, he has always been soooo exaggerated lol\n\nThe guys a born winner of course he's going to be upset why do people always feel the need to jump on everything ronaldo does\n\nü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£\n\nI thought this was the onion at first\n\nHahahhahhahahaha\n\nName one more wothless trophy than the audi cup. \n\n\nSaudi cup\n\nDude's a competitor, I get it. Sucks to fucking lose, I get my panties in bunch over Rocket League, I can't imagine a final especially when you know you put it all out there. Kobe was obesses, Messi was, Ronaldo, etc. Many athletes know how hard they work, no matter what. \n\nOn the outside yeah it looks \"silly\" but in the moment, its still competition.\n\nHe probably had a bonus in his contract for winning.\n\nOr.... a penalty of some sort for losing.\n\nHe is an idiot.\n\nI love him \n\nfinally"

And then Busquets got up again and he was fine, the crybaby.](https://streamable.com/n8jcu7) A nasty guy to play against.\"\n\nSaying what we all think\n\nThere‚Äôs a certain C word that I think describes busquets perfectly. Great player, massive unt\n\nYes, I think the word you're looking for describes his rank as a nobleman. He is a massive count.\n\nThe Cunt of Camp Nou strikes again!\n\nXavi was almost the same. They new how to milk cards for opponents through overreacting.\n\nYeah you missed a letter and it wasn‚Äôt an i\n\nIf you've ever read any of the other things Wesley has said or anything about him you'd know he's also a massive *unt.\n\nNever said he wasn‚Äôt, but keep telling me what I know.\n\nOk bro\n\nCunt. There.\n\nMassive cunt that guy is. Barkalona it‚Äôs in their DNA\n\nCarvajal?\n\nYep, that's how it is. But I wouldn't deny that he's a good player.¬†\n\nRodri taking over his mantle.\n\nNot much to see here, though. Guys do that sort of thing in every single match.\n\nIf he's saying Busquets is worse than the baseline, he's got to come up with more evidence.\n\nThere's not much evidence needed here, Busquets was known for this in prime Barca days.¬†\n\nThat Barcelona team cemented such \"playstyle\", not many players were doing that let alone teams\n\nMore evicence than playing against him for many years and explicit name Busquets?\n\nThis is Sneijders opinion. He played against Busquets and many other players for years and from his experience Busquets was worse than others in that regard.\n\nIt's not that deep or complicated.\n\nThe evidence is having eyes.\n\nThere is a reason he isnt considered at the very upper elite even though he was one of the best midfielders of all time mate, its because he was so immensely hated and got so much ridicule for his pathetic cheating antics on the field.\n\nNo one needs to provide evidence. You can find it yourself as you‚Äôre clearly young/new to watching football. üòÇ\n\nAnyone that watched Barcelona during that era will know about the very regular play acting by Busquets.\n\nPretty sad that it‚Äôs the norm tbh.\n\nWhat more evidence do you need? He was a twat.\n\nI guess you never heard of the term ‚ÄúUEFALONA‚Äù back in the 2010s\n\nI always say the same about this subject. Professional players will do anything that puts them in advantage as long as the ref allows it. The FAs could stop all the shitty diving and crying tomorrow if they wanted to. Start giving post game yellow cards for clear diving and problem solved\n\nYellows and reds should be handed out for diving post game. It's such an obvious solution that I can't understand why it hasn't been implemented yet\n\nSomewhat subjective calls handed out post-game will only lead to so many issues. They can't even handle VAR checks on pretty clear cut issues.\n\nThey should come on Reddit and make their decisions based on what we think‚Ä¶\n\nI think there‚Äôs a difference between different countries though.\n\nSome do it but it‚Äôs kind of ‚Äúknown‚Äù that it‚Äôs underhand and out of order. You know you‚Äôre cheating by doing it. In some other countries, it‚Äôs not seen cheating, it‚Äôs seen as a perfectly legitimate tactic.\n\nI agree that the FAs should clamp down on it with immediate red cards. It would be a bloodbath initially, but players would soon get the message. However I‚Äôm not sure all FAs would be on board with it.\n\nDoes anyone remember they actually did this. They had retrospective bans for diving. I remember niasse the Everton striker got one. \n\nThen Harry Kane and dele alli blatantly dived and mysteriously didn‚Äôt receive anything. Then they ended up cancelling the whole thing\n\nNot sure it counts unless they actually deduct points from Everton\n\nThere's still time!\n\nWe have this thing called VAR now, ehich we would seem to only use to dissallow goals. Sure would be handy for stopping diving!\n\nWould you stop the game and review every foul for diving? I don't think anyone wants that. Reviewing it after the game is better imo\n\nThe most blatant diving I would punish right away on the pitch, yes. Yellow, straight away\n\nDon't all fouls that lead to a pk get checked? If so a dive causing a pk should result in a straight red\n\nDon't have to stop the game, just do the check and if you determine that a foul that was given was instead diving, buzz the ref and issue a yellow. Even if it doesn't \"fix\" the call at the time, accumulating yellow cards at a high rate will start to be a deterrent pretty quickly\n\nI'd be ok with that üëç\n\nI‚Äôd go even further cause it‚Äôs deeply unsportsmanlike.\n\nFirst time 1 game\n\nSecond time banned in national and international competition until end of season.\n\nWhy stop there. 3rd time Death by firing squad.\n\n4th time, resurrection with zombie serum and forced to play under Erik Ten Hag for one season¬†\n\nThou doth protest too much sir\n\n4th infraction, murder extended family and pets Keyser Soz√© style.¬†\n\nNo they won‚Äôt, wtf is this take?\n\nDo you watch football?\n\nNot every professional simulates injury like Biscuits did.\n\nNot like Busquets but almost everyone dives some times\n\nBlatant dives yes, but a lot of what we call dives is players going down from contact which should be a foul, and if they didn‚Äôt, they might not get it. \n\nWhat I hate is the milking like they‚Äôve been shot. That‚Äôs unneeded. \n\nHaving said that, being kicked at full pelt, especially when you‚Äôve been repeatedly sprinting  does hurt and I think a lot of us forget that.\n\nBingo. If you fake it and they get a yellow or red and your team wins because of it, you got 3 points. These players are not paid millions to be honest and good people, they‚Äôre paid to win. It‚Äôs gamesmanship. Plain and simple. When the risk of punishment is greater than the benefit, it will stop. Make a dive a straight red and you‚Äôll see how quickly that shit stops\n\nNever liked Busquets, I always thought he was a little bitch.\n\n&gt;I always thought he was a little bitch.\n\nOK Justin-Timberlake\n\nLoved him as a player tho, like his qualities. But yeah, his mentality wasn't great. I feel like it got a little better as he got older and became our captain, but still bad mentality.\n\nHe just did his best and managed the game. That‚Äôs what we all do in corporate or business as well. Use the rules for ourselves.\n\nYeah, if you're a cunt, sure. Many think that you have to be one to succeed in that world, yet that doesn't cancel out being a cunt who's looking to cheat\n\nMore like an asshole\n\nSame. Busquets was always making those small fouls which had no other goal than to halt attackers. He‚Äôd do it in a way which he would often not get yellow, or the ref wouldn‚Äôt even whistle for it. But oh boy, when it happened to him, the whole world had to know. And if it happened to someone else, he‚Äôd be the first to run to the ref and make that stupid booking gesture.\n\n[removed]\n\nAgreed, it‚Äôs hard to think of a likeable Portuguese player\n\nRui costa\n\nDiogo Jota\n\nI dunno, he has a snide side. Not as bad as most, but there‚Äôs things like his celebrations in front of Leicester fans after knocking them out the League Cup. I‚Äôm a Liverpool fan and was at that match so it was great for me, but I‚Äôd have hated him otherwise.\n\nJo√£o Moutinho? Vitinha? Ricardo Carvalho? Danilo? Guerreiro? R√∫ben Neves? Just to name a few. You really need to expand your knowledge on players before saying something like that\n\nOh yeah?\n\nI absolutely loathe Pepe, and I hope he breaks his leg\n\nIt's all about playing the ref and the fans And you fell for it every time\n\nIt's well known Spanish footballers are crybabies, I'm not too surprised by Busquets being one as well.\n\nIt's a cheating mentality...from the taxi drivers to the public offices.\n\nEvery other nation is pure and not cheats, right?\n\nCulture certainly plays a part‚Ä¶ the cheating mentality in my home country is waaaaaaay stronger than where I live right now.\n\nI'm surprised Chile weren't good cheaters in football because they damn are in everyday life.\n\nIn a world table of footballing cheats - Spain are top, no question.\n\nI'd love to see a well sourced subjective opinion on this.\n\n\nId assume every region would have its worst cheater culture.\n\n\nIn pc gaming the chinese are known as the worst cheaters, and it seems like in european football spain and italy are the worst.\n\n\nI remember a documentary about copa america where the brazilians felt like the argentinians were the worst.\n\n\nI find it hilarious, and unfortunately cheating is really valuable on football, way more so than in rugby or cricket.\n\nIt‚Äôs all of south america that feels that way about them, no need for sources on this\n\nEvery country does anti tactics, but there aren‚Äôt many like argentina and spain that are proud of their if you ain‚Äôt cheating you ain‚Äôt trying culture lmao\n\n\"Credit\" where it is due but the UK countries generally frown on cheating and apart from one notable example in 1966 their history is marred by the failure to cheat to gain an advantage. Other countries would see this position as naive, and a key reason why the UK and England specifically have had little success.\n\nWhat is cheating in that sense then? Is it diving? Rooney was pretty good at diving for example\n\ndiving, time-wasting, feigning injury etc. pushing the boundaries to gain an advantage. Not solely diving. Busquets for example was incredible at this stuff.\n\nThat‚Äôs the same country whose federation had no qualms about chasing a player that was already called up by the home country (Diego Costa) with promises of guaranteed spot in the team. Scumbag behavior, they got no sportsmanship backbone, no surprise at all a lot of their players are cheats.\n\nI find it runs rampant in spanish speaking football nations. Anti jogo and cera, and frequently outright cheating it‚Äôs seen as legitimate. Brazil does it too with the diving and rolling, and we have cheats too like corinthians, but in general the spanish speaking ones do it way more. Definitely cultural sadly.\n\nPretty sure the Italians are top?\n\nBut they cheat to win...... they never win anything lol\n\nonly slightly in front of Italy\n\nWho's 3rd? Argentina, Portugal?\n\nSpanish under 23 lol\n\nI'd say Japan is.....\n\nAt least their wives cheat on them\n\nCheck out the Paralympic basketball story . That's petty as fuck\n\nevery other nation cheats lmao\n\nEngland don't, to name one\n\nGood thing he didn't took it on Neymar. Absolute swimming pool diver olympic\n\nHe dove more than a Goalkeeper\n\nSomeone is jealous they don't have a world cup.\n\nBiscuits along with Rattata (Jordi Alba). Hateful players whose good ability were always overshadowed by their pathetic crybaby antics. A stain on the sport.\n\nI even question his ability because every time he would lose the ball, he would roll on the floor and get a free kick. That‚Äôs like removing 10 dispossessions from a holding midfielder every game and then saying he is good\n\nIt's not a dispossession if he hasn't lost the ball though is it? If you ever watched him play you wouldn't be questioning his ability either lol, guy was genuinely a top top central midfielder\n\nSure, he would lose the ball, then hold his face and roll on the ground. It would not count as dispossession as referee would give him a free kick. I think it is you who has not seen any of his games\n\nYeh he was a crybaby but he was still a fantastic player - he was part of midfield three constantly for arguably the two best teams of all time. He had buckets and buckets of ability\n\n[This dive](https://youtu.be/CFrX6mn8Xj0) has got to be the worst one.\n\nWrong video mate, [i think you mean this one](https://youtu.be/c7GxStFvSPA?si=G2vwqv9CQzgsW8LC)\n\nNope, it's [this one](https://youtu.be/TAOmaC5XTnE).\n\nAlso, stop deleting and editing your comments, you're embarrassing yourself.\n\nI‚Äôm a Barca fan but I watched from 2015 onwards where their ability was fading and their refusal to move on was costing Messi in the champions league year after year so unlike most Barca fans I absolutely hated them both. \n\nAnd their crybaby antics was something that pissed me off relentlessly. It didn‚Äôt even stop on the pitch, jordi alba cried in the dressing room when we was 1-0 down against livepool at half time. Imagine your on a team and one of the captains is doing that even though your 3-1 up on aggregate with one half left to go to reach the final. I hate that those two idiots wasted Messis last great years as a player but atleast he got a decent team in the World Cup where he could show what he had still\n\nSome ‚ÄúBarca‚Äù fan you are‚Ä¶\n\nfor hating the cry baby antics of some of our players im not a fan? im just not someone whos bias, i dont like diving either, i wont praise my own players because they dived to win a penalty, i want to win cause we're the best not because of what i think are disgusting antics. People that support their team players no matter what they do are fan boys and fan girls and that mentality is the kind of mentality that lets celebrities think theyre untouchable and results in the piddys and mendys of the world.\n\nIt‚Äôs more the fact that they are legends of your club who delivered every trophy and you slag them off, that‚Äôs embarrassing and shows you are a fake and terrible ‚Äúfan‚Äù. \n\nI‚Äôm not a fan of straight up diving, but often busquets was actually fouled and then made the most of it, with how shit referees are you sometimes have to that just to get the call, and at the very top level everyone is trying for any advantage they can get. \n\nPlus every good team needs their shithouse who bends the rules.\n\nI think you are a Messi fan, not Barcelona‚Ä¶\n\nWhat? Thats the opposite of a fake fan, I didn‚Äôt glory hunt this team, they‚Äôve been on a downward spiral since until very recently. I support them cause I like how well a lot of the players behave on and off the pitch, it‚Äôs supposed to be ‚Äúmes que un club‚Äù and most players uphold those values so well, we don‚Äôt have ‚Äúdirty‚Äù tacklers like ramos we had players like pique who are very clean. Not saying he‚Äôs perfect obviously he isn‚Äôt but it‚Äôs just an example. \n\nThe youngsters now embody that well they‚Äôre all very well behaved and don‚Äôt do antics and horrible behaviour on or off the pitch e.g like rudiger slapping the kit man. And two players I very much disliked the antics of were busquets and alba diving and moaning and crying. \n\nTbh I feel vindicated because the results are self evident. I always felt like they slacked and didn‚Äôt work hard enough due to their belief their positions were cemented in the team with no competition and because of that Barca paid the price in Europe where their complacency resulted in huge comebacks. There‚Äôs a reason Modric won the balon d‚Äôor at the age they went to mls and he won more champions leagues at the age they‚Äôre at now. It‚Äôs because he embodies a professional which is the type of player I liked while they slacked and got complacent, representing your club is an honour so many would die for and I don‚Äôt respect players who take that for granted and become slackers.\n\nOr maybe they declined because they got older‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs one thing to criticize a legend when they slow down abit and become a liability to the team.\n\nIt‚Äôs a complete other thing to say you ‚Äúabsolutely HATE‚Äù two of the most successful and best players from your club, even after they‚Äôve left lol. Your midfield turned worse for abit once busquets left if anything. \n\nAnd Barca has been one of the most scandalous clubs of the 2000s so please don‚Äôt spout nonsense about upholding values lol‚Ä¶\n\nYou‚Äôre inventing arguments. I said I hated their antics, I said I hated they wasted Messis last years as I felt his performances deserved more results on the pitch. But I never said I hated them.\n\nI felt the decline was due to their becoming complacent which many subsequent coaches at Barca complained about the lack of intensity in training, but it‚Äôs true we will never know for certain but I‚Äôm of the opinion that‚Äôs why\n\nBruh !!! He is a professional  player. He would want you carded if he could get away with it. Was he different than any other ? hardly .\n\nAlways been a scumbag, but he knew how to play football at least, I think that at some point they thought everyone at Barca to fall on the ground at every touch\n\n&gt; teached\n\nTaught*. It's always taught. I just taught you something.\n\nBro loves taught-ing üëç\n\nLmao\n\nThanks for the correction :)\n\nPep‚Äôs Barca we‚Äôre one of the best shithousing teams ever\n\nHonesty, you don't win titles by being nice guys. Teams that win will do whatever it takes. When it's your guy, it's just smart football. But when it's the other team, they are lousy diving cheaters...\n\nI think Busquets is the best MCD to ever lived, but also super protected by referees and a piece of shit. \n\n\nAlways wished I had the chance to see him on a different to team.\n\nWell, he's Spanish, isn't he?\n\nI mean he‚Äôs right.  I‚Äôve got the rose tinted glasses on for busquets now since we don‚Äôt have to see him play and he was phenomenal but my god he was the biggest bitch ever.\n\nI wonder what are his thoughts about his national teammate Arjen Robben\n\ndont forget von Bommel\n\nBusquets jsut wanted cards for opponents, Robben was simply psychologically burdened by his injuries and never demanded cards. After he had been healthy for some time, this theatricality stopped\n\nRodri‚Äôs exactly the same.\n\nWill never forget him bitching and moaning that Scotland were cheaters and that the pitch was bad when we beat them 2-0. Ironically, Joselu went down several times wanting a penalty and they were committing loads of fouls.\n\nThis is the same lad(Busquets) who was touched lightly by an Inter player and started rolling around on the ground covering his face, even sneaking a peek for a second to see what's going on, and getting the player a red card, in the last leg of a UCL semi final, trailing by a goal, with an hour to go.\n\nOf course it‚Äôs the same lad, this is exactly the situation Sneijder is talking about in the post\n\nA redditor reading the article itself?! Utter woke nonsense\n\nToday's players would never\n\nIncredible talent, equally incredibly soft, loved him if you were a barca fan, didn‚Äôt like him if you weren‚Äôt, one of the best in his position ever, on the softest in his position ever\n\nWhy is anyone getting butt hurt over this? These guys are paid millions and millions of euros to play and win. Whatever they do, as long as it is toeing the line and not going across it, its fair game. \n\nThey owe us, the sponsors and their clubs anything it takes to win.\n\nRobben vs Mexico tho\n\nsneijder the type of guy to base his whole opinion on another grown man based off one play\n\nI hated so many of that greatest generation of Spanish players.\n\nI despised Jordi Alba the most - brilliant player obviously but I absolutely hates him due to the diving/crying antics.\n\nThis may be a controversial opinion, but I believe if you foul someone, kick them, trip them, barge them, then they have the right to make the most of it. Because in the end, it's on you for committing the foul in the first place. \n\nNow, if there's NO foul, and a player is faking it, that should be a yellow for unsportsmanlike conduct.\n\nBeef in Beefa! The Busquets story.\n\nSergio baskets\n\nSuperlig Wesley\n\nMy favorite story about Busquets is that he never posted on twitter again after Liverpool came back and beat them at Anfield in 2019. Broke the man\n\nAs a Real Madrid fan it was A nightmare to watch his acting, but to be fair he is a winner and he did what has to be done to win.\n\nIf the referees allow it is problem of the referees , not of him¬†\n\nHaha so weird to hear it from someone else \nHe is the most annoying player for me to üòÖ\n\nSpaniards for ya\n\nBusquets is a brazzer\n\nYeah, this is probably known by most people who has ever seen him play.\n\nDid the two ever have a chat in Ibiza?\n\nGOAT\n\nThis have always been the way it is with some players of rival teams.¬†\n\nHate diving and cheating as much as anyone else but it fuels the entertainment of the sport if we're all being honest with ourselves we love the drama of it\n\nEvery time this guy shows up in the news, it's him being salty over something that happened years ago. Can't stand him. It's as if he never did the same as Busquets at some point. That's football, players will take advantage of stupid refs, deal with it and stop whining.\n\nIt's not a good thing but there are too many players doing this.\n\nRamos was acting handicapped vs Juventus and got up and started asking cuadrado to leave when he's shown a red, with full energyüòÇ\n\nbusquets has become very overrated over the past few years. people forget how slow and useless he was. he mostly just passed it sideways for his entire career. solid defender not elite. good positioning and good on the ball, but not above top 25 midfielders\n\nIt tells a lot of things (and no good for him) talking about a rival so many years after the events. He may be still having nightmares the so many time he lost against Busquets.\n\nI think Wesley has been looking in his trophy cabinet again.\n\nClearly not cause he is complaining. Probably salty he lost the World Cup to Spain lmao\n\nLMAO TRUE\n\nIn the same interview he was praising xavi and iniesta\n\nHe‚Äôs basically describing the whole of La Liga. Every team, every player is doing it‚Ä¶ therefore la Liga is almost un unwatchable product. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs part of the Spanish culture, and that the fans really like to watch 90 minutes of schwalbe, and even pay money to watch it.\n\nWe don‚Äôt care because the 20 minutes of real game shows more skills and technique that the premier league long passes and run without head\n\nI asume you‚Äôre Spanish? Please explain to me what you guys think when you see players falling for no reason? Is it that you truly believe they are hurt, that you can‚Äôt see their amateur theater?\n\nIt annoys me when they make seems they have been hit but the hand of other player or things like that.\n\nWhen it is an actual foul and they simply exaggerate it to force a yellow or red I think is part of the game.\n\nIts up to the referees and VAR to stop that, and it also happens in every league, not just the Spanish.\n\nThe top coaches in the EPL are from Spain, says something about how dominant their Football is\n\nHe could've said all he wanted, there may never be a newer Busquets again. He was a special player, not known for physicality but his intelligence.\n\nFound the Barca fan\n\nBro is like 5‚Äô7 what could he have done to Busquets\n\nwhat does that have to do with anything\n\nThe whole Barca team were like this. They played amazing football, kept the ball forever but when a team did out play or out work them (occasionally) they started falling over, crowding the ref, anything to stop to oppo. Busquets and Pepe from Madrid were two of the worst for this\n\nWhen you are actively buying the referees, you have to help them a little with the antics so that it can stay somewhat credible\n\nThat pulled from the inner workings of your arse?\n\nYou mean paying 7.3 million euros to Negreira, vice president of the Technical Committee of Referees, was for his scouting abilities ?\n\nAs it turns out it was so what else you got?\n\nTLDR:\n\nA Read Madrid reject and former [Fenerbah√ße](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenerbah%C3%A7e_S.K._(football)) midfielder who everybody has forgotten about has a whinge about an actual football great.\n\nSneijder was #4 at Ballon d'Or 2010 and also won the silver boot at the World Cup 2010 and UEFA Midfielder of the year.\n\nNot saying one is better than the other, but Busquets has none of such individual accolades.\n\nEdit: Ball, not boot. He was voted the second best player at the WC 2010.\n\n&gt;also won the silver boot at the World Cup 2010\n\n... that's a thing? They don't actually hand that out, do they? I don't remember Messi getting it after the last WC final when Mbappe got the golden one.\n\nMeant ball, not boot.\n\n[https://www.plus.fifa.com/en/content/wesley-sneijder-silver-ball-award-2010-fifa-world-cup-south-africa/ee3a5005-d35b-43f9-863a-e94f093e0543?gl=de](https://www.plus.fifa.com/en/content/wesley-sneijder-silver-ball-award-2010-fifa-world-cup-south-africa/ee3a5005-d35b-43f9-863a-e94f093e0543?gl=de)\n\nNice, and the other won 2 euros and 1 world cup in the spawn of 8 years, not to mention all the accolades Barca won during that time as well.\n\nOne is a CDM and the other a AM\n\nWhen you think of one of the greatest 5s to play the game you think Busquets. When thinking of a 10 there are more names in front of Sneijder‚Äôs just saying.\n\nNot to take away from his achievements just you cant compare them\n\nRent free.\n\nName one thing Sneijder said that was wrong\n\nHe might be right, but it‚Äôs like Cassano talking about Cristiano, or a fly criticizing god‚Ä¶ Irrelevant.\n\nNot really. Doing Sneijder a massive disservice there. Absolutely brilliant player in his prime from 2008-2010ish. Most capped Dutch player of all time too iirc\n\nHe was, I‚Äôm only half-joking. Still, him and van der Vaart both seem insufferable.\n\nOh yeah van der Vaart is an absolute tool I‚Äôm with you on that\n\nCan‚Äôt blame others always. This is the style of a player who is good dribbling the ball, they have to feint and dive to draw a card. It is worst being seriously injured. Considering teams will try to injured them.\n\nUnpopular opinion: Busquets is one of the most overrated players ever. Passing it sideways and diving constantly were his only skills\n\nIt‚Äôs almost as if it‚Äôs what his position on the pitch dictates he does.\n\nIf that was the case he wouldn‚Äôt be the only little rat that did it week in week out\n\nPerfect definition of an average Hispanic player behavior\n\nSpaniard player*\n\nPlayers with a victim complex: Busquets, Xavi, Alba and Piqu√©.\n\nIbiza is oddly specific\n\nstill rent free from 2010\n\nüßÇ  from 2010 WC\n\nrobben flopped too lmao\n\nHe was overrated also, I could not stand watching that Barcelona team pass pass pass pass pass, it was boring as fuck\n\nCoooooooooooked.\n\nBiscuits is arguably the most overrated player ever. Though solid. But his limitations were clear.\n\nExactly don't compare him to my goat Toni Kroos."

But, to be fair this isn't a game of almost.\n\nthink it was like 11,5 milimetres or something like that?\n\n115 micro millimetres\n\nMicrometres, yes. Google Man City 115 for proof.\n\nThat‚Äôs what she said\n\nIs this the time Sane then scored off the post on the other side? So the 11,5 mms fucked them twice?\n\nThen again we won the CL that season and then dud win the league the next season. Arsenal have won nothing\n\nArsenal have only been title contenders again since the last two years. Liverpool have been prime title contenders for the last 6 and won it once.\n\nI mean let's not overstate it. \"Prime title contenders for the last 6\". They were 5th in 22/23, 3rd in 20/21, and 4th in 17/18. They've challenged properly three times and won it once.\n\nThey got pretty close this season imo\n\nThat feels generous given the April they had and the final league table, but they were in a race in March for sure.\n\nLiverpool arguably had the worst var decisions all season. Especially amongst the top 3.\n\nLiverpool got unluckiest, city got luckiest and arsenal was somewhere in the middle. Ultimately decisive in the title run in\n\nWerent there like 3-4 clear red cards not given for arsenal?\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Gunners/comments/1ck21hy/straight\\_red\\_card\\_vs\\_not\\_even\\_a\\_foul\\_or\\_yellow/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gunners/comments/1ck21hy/straight_red_card_vs_not_even_a_foul_or_yellow/)\n\n\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Gunners/comments/1ck17ds/3\\_fouls\\_2\\_weeks\\_1\\_yellow\\_card\\_make\\_it\\_make\\_sense/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gunners/comments/1ck17ds/3_fouls_2_weeks_1_yellow_card_make_it_make_sense/)\n\nIt's always the same. Arsenal get the fewest yellow and red cards for the teams playing against them although they're the most fouled.\n\nIt was also four handball penalty situations in one single match not given, not to mention that Newcastle goal that was over the line (not given because no camera angles available), foul for a two handed shove in the back of Gabriel, handball after he headed the ball down, and then offside (not given because no camera angles available again). That was the most laughable VAR decision of the whole season for me.\n\nArsenal was the unluckiest by far. It's not really about luck though since the PGMOL is biased. The majority of the referees come from the greater Manchester area and none from London and too many of them are taking side business from the Middle East.\n\nArsenal has been screwed by VAR all season long, it's just been game after game of the same. I bet the biased Liverpool fans don't even remember a call like [this](https://arsenalist.com/f/var-says-no-penalty-what-the-hell-2024-02-04.html) because they're so busy crying about one offside call.\n\nThat's a very fucking dubious penalty if that's what your thinking and I'm not even a Liverpool fan\n\nMac Allister took the player out first so it's a stonewall penalty and he was through on goal so it should've been a red card as well. Nothing dubious about that. It's mind-boggling that it wasn't given though.\n\nMarch? They were in the race with 6 games to go and being given an easier run-in than arsenal, ended up 9 points behind city. Liverpool absolutely bottled it this year.\n\nLFC Fan here, totally agree with you, I am sure you are not LFC as you would be watching Jurgen Klopp Farewell videos instead of thinking what the fuck just happened?\n\nWe had nothing to give in that race. We massively overperformed results wise. Pretty much any match we played was close, while Arsenal and City dominated theirs. We ran ourselves to the ground and had no chance to keep it up with all the injuries.\n\nSorry sir apparently the word bottling is reserved only for arsenal and not other clubs.\n\nAlso thay 20/21 3rd has a massive asterisk over it\n\nOnly reason we came third was cause the other teams around us were also shit\n\nWe finished 5th last year and were shit through out. Certainly weren‚Äôt prime title contenders. Same for the year after we won the league.\n\nWe've had two poor years in 9 seasons, and even one of those had a memorable late run and Ali's header to make top 4. I'll take that under any manager. Would've won more leagues if City weren't cheats and more European Cups if Real Madrid weren't powered by some divine football devil magic.\n\nCertainly would have. But we certainly weren‚Äôt title contenders during the seasons we didn‚Äôt contend for the title. I wouldn‚Äôt change it for the world mate it‚Äôs been class throughout.\n\nYou can only claim that you would have won the league if you consistently came 2nd, which wasn‚Äôt the case.\n\nCheers Jeff\n\nI quite like Liverpool and their success is undeniable. But let‚Äôs not forget it was a 30 year wait for you winning the league. Also before you bleet it, yep Istanbul was crazy impressive.,  but you still had a spectacularly long brown patch for a club of your stature. \n\nSo, and I say this with love \n\nWind yer neck in mate. It‚Äôs your turn to have a go on the new manager game of death ride.\n\nWhy are you talking to me as if I am a Liverpool fan\n\nYou they them whatever you spoke like one so I assumed, which I apologise for\n\nExcept for that I really didn't and nobody else respoding to me thought that\n\n Not really the point\n\nIt is pretty much exactly the point. Arsenal were starting to almost slip out of the top 6 for crying out loud. Brendan Rodgers was close to winning the league with Liverpool before Klopp.\n\nLet‚Äôs not pretend that Rodgers left Klopp a team capable of doing that. The one time we got close under him was thanks to Suarez doing freak things. It was a massive overachievement and when Suarez fucked off to Barca and Gerrard to US, it was at best a top 6 team.\n\nI‚Äôd say Suarez and Sturridge combined, the threat they each posed that gave each of them more space than a lone attacker etc.  Suarez obviously being the greater of the pair. Like you say when Suarez went that dropped off a cliff.\n\nSturridge, Sterling and Coutinho were also important, sure. Sturridge the biggest one of the three. But they were all lifted up by the Suarez magic, as well as Gerrard playing a deeper role and having the drive to go for the title one last time. I‚Äôll give some credit to Rodgers for creating an attacking setup that made the title charge possible, but defense-wise we were all over the place.\n\ndefence was definitely a major issue, team wasn't balanced.  And yeah Suarez brought more out of the others, even just his presence.  One thing that was always noticeable about him was that his touch was way beyond the norm.\n\nCant argue that Suarez was better then Sturridge but i think Sturridge is underrated by many, maybe due to all the injuries so they rarly watched his finishes, one thing he maybe was better then Suarez at.\n\nLiverpool had slipped out of the top 4/6 before Klopp arrived. Rodgers coming second was the only time we qualified for the champions league between Benitez and Klopp.\n\nIn Liverpool's first two seasons of competiting for the title we won the CL and actually won the league...\n\nIn Arsenal's first two, they won nothing\n\nArsenal title contenders since 20+ years - ftfy\n\nTook Liverpool 30 years didn‚Äôt it?\n\nYou‚Äôre correct if you meant they were more consistent than Arsenal. Am a United fan myself - will not disagree on that with you.\n\nCL that year had no final, but yes, it was obviously a better season than ours.\n\nKlopp built a much more mature team than Arteta. I think this Arsenal side has a lot of potential going into next seasons.\n\n98 vs 97 iirc.\n\nYes\n\nHard to beat city's illegal wallet\n\nAnd their lawyers\n\nHow dare you do what we do\n\nI luv da salt lol were massive!!! /s\n\nAresnal almost did it by cheating themselves\n\nCity should be promoted to the Icarus league where rules don‚Äôt apply. Leave the premiere league for those who understand how competition works.\n\n[deleted]\n\nHaving two domestic cups is ridiculous though. Scrap one of them and you can do replays in the other one.\n\n[deleted]\n\nWhy should England be almost the only country with more than one domestic cup and no break around Christmas? Forcing clubs to play football more or less every three days all season long clearly leads to burnout and a lot of injuries. But I guess England is happy to sacrifice success in the European cups and for the national team.\n\n[deleted]\n\nIt's not only one game at Boxing day, it's games throughout the holidays around Christmas and New Year's Eve. Chelsea even played on Christmas Eve last year if I remember correctly. And then again on the 27th, and then again on the 30th.\n\nArsenal were terribly worn out and out of form around that period where they lost to West Ham and then Fulham on New Year's Eve, but thanks to going out early in the domestic cups, they got a few weeks of recovery and training and then they came out as a new team on January 20th where they won 5-0 again. There's just too many games being played in one season in England and something has gotta give.\n\n[deleted]\n\nIt's not a problem only for Arsenal and Chelsea, the same goes for all clubs in the Premier League and especially those playing in European competitions with a lot of players in the national team. Look at Manchester United for example, they have had so many injuries that they could barely field a back line at the end of the season. It's been similar with Newcastle and Spurs and so on.\n\nAnd the traditions has already changed, we have gotten more fixtures than we used to have around Christmas to squeeze all the other fixtures during the season in. It's not about preserving traditions, they are just increasing the burden on these clubs and players as the years go by. Maybe you don't care about the success of these clubs but if any English club want to stay successful in the European competitions and if you want a successful national team then you need to change something. It has to be a balance between the top level and the grass roots.\n\nWhen almost all top level clubs are playing reserve players in a domestic cup like they do in the Carabou Cup then you know it's time to scrap it. They can scrap the European Conference League while they're at it.\n\nHard to beat a team that‚Äôs cheating their way to success. It‚Äôs like running a 100m sprint, but the other runner has a 50m head start. City are so popular now, even VAR works in their favor these days, Kyle Walker can truck you in their box and they‚Äôd just say oh he‚Äôs fast and strong. That guy fouls everyone and gets away with it, he‚Äôll try this crap at the euros and have England crash out.\n\nyeah even yesterday, 2 city players barged into the back of a west ham player and no foul. any other team, any other day gets that foul 10 out of 10 times but with city its just dismissed.\n\nfunny. I saw a clear handball penalty that VAR let it go. Quite literally in the hand. \n\nAlso, Arsenal's 2nd goal came from a Jesus's handball. My man even made a movement to assist, and VAR not even flinch.\n\nHonest question, still new to the sport. IMO it looked like Jesus intentional kept his arm flat against his side when he hit that ball. Does that have an impact on whether or not it‚Äôs a handball? Like if your arm isn‚Äôt sticking out and is tucked to the body, is it considered part of the body?\n\nif it hits your arm and its down by your side its technically not a handball because its ball to hand rather than hand to ball. problem is with var when its slowed down so much its easy to be swayed either way so refs dont always make the correct decision as its hard to determine the players intention\n\nit also matters that the hand wasn‚Äôt important in changing the balls direction as if not the arm, the ball would have just bounced off his side/rips anyway saying he got no advantage out of it as the hand was as close to his body as possible while he also protected himself from the opponent going to bodycheck him.\n\nThat‚Äôs what they said during the match and it makes sense i d say. If the arm would be out ofc that d be a handball with an advantage\n\nIt‚Äôs amazing what one can buy with limitless oil wealth\n\nBlinded by hate.\n\nWalker is one of the best fullbacks the league has seen.\n\nThose are not mutually exclusive.\n\nCity are just too good, Pep is a genius with a blank check. Arteta and Klop are both amazing managers but let‚Äôs not kid ourselves, they don‚Äôt have the tools that Pep has.\n\nJust to be clear, by tools you mean the aforementioned blank check, right?\n\nThey have 115 tools on top of that.\n\n115 that they‚Äôve brought up. They‚Äôve been at it since they signed Robinho!\n\nAnyway it doesn‚Äôt matter, they still won on the pitch. If it wasn‚Äôt city it would be another super club pipping somebody to the post.\n\ndecisions too, they brought haaland 66 games 63 goals.  51m\n\nwe brought Nunez 65 games 20 goals. 64m\n\nThe books might say haaland was 51m , they‚Äôve likely 5001m for him\n\nNot the same when you consider wages and city‚Äôs infamous book cooking.\n\nYes, and that other tool :3\n\nKDB?\n\nClearly the bald head wdym\n\nDidn't even think about that, silly me\n\nRodri actually. City falls apart like puzzle pieces without him\n\nReally curious to see the penalty they get for breaking FFP rules.\n\nWould be great to see something real, like what happen to the rangers (being dropped to the lowest league for City to fight their way back up to Premier league).\n\nThey will receive no actual punishment because Mansour will just pay off whoever makes the decision\n\nOne floor in the Burj Khalifa, and one private island for each person investigating City‚Äôs charges\n\nIsn't it actual courts that determine violation?\n\nNot sure the fucker can pay off English judges tbf.\n\nIs it? FFP is not a law...\n\nYes but providing misleading financials is criminal.\n\nAlso breach of contract is a civil law tort.\n\nIs Manchester City facing criminal charges?\n\nif they provided misleading finanicals then probably, yes.\n\nAny sources for that? No reports I've seen on the story even mention the possibility of criminal charges.\n\nWell they have multiple charges of misleading financials, which is just objectively a crime in this country.\n\nthat seems fair but unlikely tbh. i personally think they should start on -10 points for the same number of years they cheated. even on that basis they would have lost at least 2-3 seasons inc this year. again however i doubt they'll get punished, city seem to be very clever at dragging this on and on till it amounts to nothing\n\nIf even a quarter of the 115 is true, i think they should at the VERY least be demoted a league.\n\nSimply \"not winning the premier league this season\" is not really a punishment.\n\nyeah thats true because even if they fall 2-4th they'll get champions league money which doesnt seem fair on everyone else. I'd love to see them in league 2, man city of the 90s coming back full circle and paul dickov coming back out of retirement\n\nIf a quarter of it is true then they should be stripped of titles and demoted.\n\nNo point fining them or any of the big teams tbh.\n\nI'm just glad United are too stupid to be as good as City despite spending the same or more lol\n\nLets not have Arteta in the same conversation with Klopp lol. Not yet at least\n\n\"I remember my first beer\"\n- Jurgen Klopp\n\nIs he alluding to city being cheats?\n\nI like to think he is.\n\nKlopps a decent human being regardless.\n\nI think he's referring to getting an insanely high amount of points and still losing. That being said, 97 points and losing is honestly on another level.\n\nHe‚Äôs referring to being a point behind and winning all your remaining games, only for City to win all of theirs.\n\n Yes, they both have suffered a club allowed to mock financial rules over many years and get away with it. So far. I shouldn‚Äôt think that‚Äôs controversial.\n\nGUYS DONT TOUCH THE UPVOTES, KEEP IT 115 BABY!\n\nMe down voting in the effort to make it 115\n\nI'm doing my part!\n\nSame\n\nI downvoted my own comment to help!\n\nIm trying but some asshole just gave it another upvote. I think we need to call the lawyers to make up some more charges quickly so we can get back on level\n\nStill holding strong 4 hours later lol!\n\nDown voted to get it back to 116, we need one more to step up!\n\nYes in fact they have played with 11 accounts not footballers.\n\nSeriously ... Ffp rules make no sense whichever way you look at them. If city owners can afford the best players ... Let them buy the best players. \n\nAs Chelsea under abrahamovic, Liverpool in the 70s and utd in 90s\n\nThey can‚Äôt afford them that‚Äôs the whole point lol. They‚Äôre using money that they can‚Äôt use to buy players, hence the 115FFP charges\n\nThat s my point. What does it even mean money they cannot use?!!?\n\nThey have rich owners that can attract the best players/coaches by offering the best in contracts and can flex in transfer market. \n\nThere is a reason arsenal came second and Liverpool came third rather than Scunthorpe or Oxford. And the reason is money. So it s fine for Liverpool and arsenal to have more money than Scunthorpe and Oxford, but not fair if city have more money than Liverpool and arsenal?\n\nThat s why ffp is a nonsense idea.\n\nBut the club doesnt have the money, the owners do. If the saudis bought oxford and wanted to spend a few billions to buy any player they want it wouldnt be allowed because of ffp\n\nThat s exactly my point. Why make rules so that man united or arsenal remain on top and stop Oxford from becoming the next big club?\n\nThe owners have the money and want to spend it on football... And so? Where s the problem?\n\nYour worried about pedantics. They have broken the rules, 115 times and no one else has. The point is that they‚Äôre operating unfairly. Other clubs with charges got point reductions. So why should other clubs get punished but not them\n\nBECAUSE OTHER PL CLUBS ARE SPENDING MONEY THAT THEY ACTUALLY MAKE, YOU NEED RULES SO THAT YOU CAN HAVE COMPETITION. THATS WHY ITS CALLED A FARMER'S LEAGUE BECAUSE CITY DONT PLAY BY THE RULES AND THEY KEEP WINNING FAKE ASS FUCKING TITLES 4 IN A ROW NOW.\n\nAllegedly¬†\n\nIf it was just an allegation though you‚Äôd assume they wouldn‚Äôt be making the investigation so difficult.\n\nWhat?\n\nThis is how any investigation works if you don‚Äôt think you did it.\n\nAlso the charges for not cooperating are because City claims it did already cooperate and the investigators were just asking for the same things over and over again.\n\nMaybe City is guilty as hell, but idk, nothing about the investigation has been unusual so far besides that you could argue the prosecutors are taking forever to take it to court, but there could be one millions reasons for that, anywhere from it takes time to get their ducks in a row to they don‚Äôt have a strong case and are struggling to put things together.\n\nBut the Everton and Forest charges were MUCH more straight forward and Everton just admitted to it right away\n\nCity is claiming the allegations are false, so ofc it‚Äôs going to take much more time for a conclusion\n\nNobody else has been charged for being difficult though have they? You also don‚Äôt get charged for simply defending yourself, that isn‚Äôt how an investigation works. You have every right to defend yourself, but that isn‚Äôt what city are being charged with. The prosecutors are more or less implying that City‚Äôs behaviour is exactly why they‚Äôre taking so long to get it to court, in a manner that is deemed out of the ordinary, and hence the charges.\n\nEdit: about 1/3 of the charges (35) are for non-compliance with the investigation. That isn‚Äôt just defending yourself, neither is that considered normal process.\n\nhttps://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cgrjv9ydv31o.amp\n\n??\n\nI‚Äôm not sure I understand.\n\nEverton didn‚Äôt get charged for not cooperating because they immediately ‚Äúpled guilty.‚Äù\n\nForest was in a similar boat.\n\nCity is being accused of significantly more things which they claim they didn‚Äôt do.\n\nThe investigation team is basically claiming that City was giving them the items they wanted, possibly because they think they are hiding items from them (which they would have to prove).\n\nCity is claiming that ‚Äúhey, you asked us for stuff, we gave you stuff, what else do you want from us.‚Äù\n\nIt would be like if a neighbor borrowed a bunch of tools from you, and you asked for them back, they give them back, and then you‚Äôre like, wait, didn‚Äôt I lend you my hammer and a ladder? Where are the rest of my tools. But the neighbor claims they gave you everything.¬†\n\nBeing charged for not cooperating doesn‚Äôt inherently mean they didn‚Äôt, it means the prosecution THINKS they didn‚Äôt.\n\nIt will be very interesting to find out the results, not matter what the punishment or non-punishment is. I‚Äôm guessing there are going to be updates to FFP afterwards regardless of what happens, but right now nothing has been proven true in either direction. City hasn‚Äôt successfully defended themselves, nor has the prosecution produced a smoking gun.¬†\n\nIf you read a link, their claim is that the evidence was gathered illegally, not that they are necessarily innocent.\n\nThe money issues are largely fraud, which as far as I understand it is illegal as much as against FFP rules etc.\n\nAgain, you can waffle on as much as you‚Äôd like but 1/3 of the 115 charges are for non compliance with the investigation. Certainly suggests the investigators think city are not complying.\n\nAnother edit: this is also ignoring the fact that city have already been found guilty and charged of some of these charges by UEFA.\n\nAh yes, the ‚Äûlet them cheat!‚Äú- defense. Let‚Äôs see if people still use this when a team buys off the refs or starts getting caught doping.\n\nAh, yes! United in the 90s. Bought so many players.¬†\n\nIrwin, Schmeichel, Cantona, Roy Keane, Andy Cole, Ole, Sheringham, Stam &amp; Yorke were all bought in the 90s\n\nDamn, that's so many. And how many academy players? What I was trying to say is that they did have a class of 92 where Man City only have Foden.\n\nThat‚Äôs literally not what you said at all. \n\nAlso, United literally broke the transfer record in the 90s, so to say they barely bought anyone is a joke. One of the most prolific buyers of this period. \n\nPlease bear in mind, I only listed their biggest signings of the decade. This was not even everyone they bought.\n\nAh, yeah forgot this sub hates Manchester United xD\n\nI mean everything I said is a complete fact. \n\nEveryone who isn‚Äôt a United supporter hates United. It‚Äôs not exclusive to this sub.\n\nUsername checks out\n\nTitle raceial discrimination\n\nThe league is a joke\n\nAbu FC is scam and corruption. Destroyed the league\n\nYe but they're were two points away, not one. They don't know how we feel at all!!\n\nYes we do! This is about man city being able to financially dope and Arsenal building the best team and having the best season they've had in decades and still not being able to win a title.\n\nI was joking my guy no worries\n\nSorry was still pissed off about man city and kind of jumped on you there\n\nOmg a whole point more! No way!!!!! Couldn‚Äôt be any different!\n\nLiverpool finished second on 97 points. Just brutal.\n\nNaw that Liverpool team is miles ahead of this Arsenal team\n\nAnother reminder that if the fair play rules were applied quickly and evenly to all teams, Man City would have been deducted points both seasons....\n\nImpossible to win the Prem. \n\nMaximum amount of points to win in a PL season is 114 pts and you need over 115 pts to beat City.\n\nThe problem is that the EPL allows any type of foreign investment into the clubs, which leads to richer and richer ownership.  City just happens to be the biggest. Sure they break the FFP rules, but the only ones that FFP ever really goes after are the smaller clubs that really can't fight back. The EPL made this mess, and many fans were/are very happy with deep-pocket owners.\n\nThis wasn't even the \"elite\" version of City. Nor was last year. Liverpool's points total in 21-22 that missed out by a point would've won both leagues. Don't even get me fuckin started on 97 not being enough.\n\nHaaland in his first season was disgustingly efficient\n\nArsenal are the real champions\n\nNot a fan of either but....Liverpool pushed City to way more points while also challenging in other cups and reaching multiple CL finals?\n\nI can see the similarities but the levels were a lot higher.\n\nI wonder how long it‚Äôll take oil fc 2 (Newcastle) to finish first or second with city for the next decade.\n\nI believe it was even worse for Liverpool considering how many points they had that season.\n\n115 tears ‚Ä¶\n\nYou fucking crybabies \n\nBlue Moon has risen\n\nMan U next up to get crushed\n\nKlopp says arse nal have suffered what he also experienced.Losing the title to pepfps ffp cheats\n\nKlopp still moaning even when he has left.\n\nNot being as good as the best team? Yeah I would have thought so\n\nNot being good enough? Okay‚Ä¶\n\nSuffering from success\n\nBeing crap and getting found out?\n\nConsistent failure?\n\nNo they haven't. They haven't actually won the league\n\nYes they have\n\nIn recent times\n\nYes we have?\n\nYou mean 2004 is recent?\n\nSorry too early, I thought you were talking about Liverpool.\n\nObviously talking about when competing against Man City\n\nObviously talking about when competing against Man City\n\nTrue, City wasn't really relevant back then.\n\n[deleted]\n\nArsenal are the third most successful club in English football in terms of number of trophies won, do you actually watch football?\n\nArsenal literally won the community shield this year and the FA Cup like 3 years ago but ok\n\n[deleted]\n\nShield&gt;&gt;Audi\n\nJust throwing it out there: Liverpool and Arsenal have both have had higher net spends on transfer fees over the last five years than City have.\n\nNet spend is a useless stat. \n\nPep inherited a squad far more valuable than klopp and arteta because of all the spending city had already done.\n\nSo not only has he had to spend less money, but he also already had assets he could sell to balance the net.\n\nStop making excuses for 115 fc\n\nBit of a coincidence that city‚Äôs net spend ‚Äúlast 5 years‚Äù conversation has only been raised this season and not last season isn‚Äôt it? \n\nCity can now talk about the ‚Äú5 year‚Äù net spend. Because the ‚Ç¨300M they spent 6 years ago is removed and ‚Ç¨250M worth of players they received money for bought 6 or more years ago really helps that net spend plummet half a billion. \n\nForget that they basically spend ‚Ç¨60M on each position until they get a successful player. Be damned if one of them fails. Doesn‚Äôt really matter because there‚Äôs always another ‚Ç¨60M \n\nMeanwhile city fans will try and distract you of that by pointing at anyone in their squad who didn‚Äôt cost more than ‚Ç¨50m which is basically akanji and Alvarez at this point. (Excl. academy, which they should be proud of (also thanks to the Saudi billions).\n\nUhmm Foden\n\n( See : excl. means excluding)\n\nSpread that over 10 years and the conversation is different.\n\nI mean, net transfer spend tells us next to sweet FA about anything. But City have +¬£100m on Liverpool net over the past 5 years. \n\nBut by this point we all know net transfer spend is just a tiny part of what‚Äôs interesting about football finances.\n\nOn \"claimed\" transfer fees.\n\nIf we have to accept the innocent till proven guilty trope you guys need to also use the correct terminology.\n\n[deleted]\n\nPlus let‚Äôs not ignore the fact they are being brought up on charges for under-the-table money going to players, agents, and staff.\n\nRight? City spent 380 M (at least partially funded by 4 PL wins and 1 CL win) over the past 5 years. Arsenal spent 680 M funded by an Fa cup and a community shield the past 5 years.\n\nIt all started with Manchester United. That was the turning point in history.\n\nFailure?"

    "all_comment_text": "Portugal with a Spanish manager\nEngland with a German manager\n\nWtf? üòÇ\n\nYeah it‚Äôs pretty weird but let‚Äôs be true, there aren‚Äôt many good English managers. Still think it‚Äôs weird when a country is being managed by a foreign manager.\n\nSam Allardyce still to this day holds the 100% win record. Once again overlooked. It's a travesty.\n\nJokes aside how do you think he would have got on in the long run? I‚Äôll get ripped for this but at that time I think he could have pushed us to challenge.\n\nI was really hopeful, as much as he was pragmatic some of his sides played pretty good football when he had the players, even his Southampton team. I was quite worried by him starting Rooney in midfield though.\n\nThey did him a disservice too. The guy who made the allegations said he was a football agent and had dirt on loads of managers, he was a fantasist. Only thing Big Sam was caught out on (or at least was proven) was him saying that since third party ownership of players was banned, maybe a way of making money from transfers was to invest the agents companies they were taking multi million pound fees from completed transfers. Which to me, sounds like just a logical route to business.¬†\n\nTheres some speculation that his son made money from transfers to Bolton, but Fergies son did the same and that was never treated as being particularly dodgy.¬†\n\nI have a bad memory but wasn‚Äôt he also hinting he would play certain players in national side with incentives?\n\nSouthampton?\n\nHe did end his career playing there tbf. He was a great passer\n\nRooney never went to southampton\n\nA friend of mine spent time with Allardyce and he explained his football philosophy. He said, ‚Äúwhen you see space on the pitch, that‚Äôs where I want the ball to go‚Äù.  \n  \nThat was pretty much it.\n\nAnd the good ones want to manage club teams\n\nAlso true, or in general just older managers.\n\nNot the pinnacle of management anymore unfortunately\n\nEngland have had Sven and Capello in the last two decades, it's not out of the blue for us.\n\nDon‚Äôt forget the Dutch guy we had, Shteve McClaren.\n\nIs that you Big Meeks?\n\nI think its the fact that people see Germany as our rivals, despite the fact its not even true. We‚Äôve had some good matches with them over the years, and had a war with them 80 years ago, but then again they‚Äôve had many more big matches against Italy, Argentina, Spain, Holland (at least), and were at war with half of Europe when we were, so not the best grounds for a rivalry and its not mutual anyway, they dont care about us\n\nSpeaking as a German there are some grounds for a rivalry with the 1966 WC final. But historically speaking our rivals are the Dutch and we don‚Äôt care that much about the British, except a mild dislike\n\nSay what you like but you can't take that 5-1 thrashing in Munich away from me, it's the highlight of my long suffering life watching England. Only beating Argentina came close.\n\nSven gave us the \"5-1, even Heskey scored\" chant. We are forever grateful to him for that. \n\nI have to agree that it's one of the best matches I've seen as an England fan. The demolition of Holland at Euro 96 is the other game that really stands out in the pre-Southgate era.\n\nCant speak for the scots, welsh or northern irish, but in general the english tend to reserve their dislike more for the french than germans anyway. Just in football we‚Äôve never really seemed to have any epic encounters with them\n\ninclude numerous dependent act noxious badge seemly amusing point soft\n\n *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev/home)*\n\nGreat game, but wouldn‚Äôt call it epic just because it was still a group game, and we both qualified regardless. But yeah even if we counted that one thats only one match in a very long period of time\n\nten slim square longing enter groovy marry zesty stocking sloppy\n\n *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev/home)*\n\nIt's more about something earlier in 1900s. It's not football.\n\nHowever, its like Scotlands dislike for England. English don't really mind the Scots but the Scots rally behind every team England play. I don't think English dislike is as bad as that. There is some respect for German football. Id say England dislike Argentina more, although if poch came to manage I don't think the English would mind.\n\nAn English manager has never even won the English premier league lol\n\nJust get rid of it lad winger will chase it\n\nTrue but a British one has won 50% of them all, and football existed prior to 1992\n\nThere aren't many successful international managers in recent years that people would've described as good when they got the job. \n\nInternational football is just that, 1 nation against another. The manager is as just as much a part of that as anyone.\n\nApart from that the manager isn‚Äôt as much a part of that as proven by teams being allowed non national managers\n\nVery true for the German NT. language barrier is a thing too, which might why English speaking national teams have more often been managed by foreign managers\n\nI say that because Portugal and Spain are rivals and Germany and England the same ... i know is normal to have foreign managers .\n\nEngland is rivals with Germany but Germans don‚Äôt really care about England. They‚Äôre rivals with Netherlands\n\nWe're more like historical rivals, outside of football at least, but we're not in the same league as the Germans when it comes to footballing achievements.¬†\n\nTo be fair most in CONMEBOL hate Argentinians but everyone is trying to get an Argentine manager, sometimes it's good to try new stuff, I think Tuchel is better at knockout tournaments than leagues so I think England is a good fit for him.\n\nIt‚Äôs weird only for strong football nations.  Countries where football is developing sport could learn a lot from foreign managers.\n\nI think the best we can hope for is a manager that has spent a good amount of time managing in the PL and gets the league/culture, doesn‚Äôt have to have the passport, just know us and how we see football.\n\nNot just many, any. There hasn't been a winning English manager in the EPL in over three decades. No one has seriously competed in just as long. England doesn't produce competent managers. The English attitude toward football is still stuck in the 70's and 80's where English club football hit a real low, on and off the field. Only Robson and Venables seriously challenged this, but not in England and not with English players.\n\nKeegan\n\nWho cares. We should have an English manager for an English team. It's stupid.\n\nBig Sam is available\n\nBig Sam has a 100% win record with England.\n\nFucking hell. Can't you guys give Norway a manager. We're dying in dross shitheads here.\n\nThe Premier League is the richest league in the world and has an international outlook. Clubs are always looking globally for the hottest manager around. That means a lot of English managers getting overlooked.\n\nCompare that to Italy and it's totally different. Every club is looking for an Italian coach. That means Italian coaches are constantly getting top jobs, working with top players and getting great experience.\n\nMaurizio Sarri spent 25 years working in the lower leagues until he was appointed Napoli manager 10 years ago.\n\nCan you imagine an English club doing that? It would never happen.\n\nEddie Howe has an excellent reputation but it wasn't until the Saudis took over Newcastle that he got offered a top job.\n\nI bet Kieran McKenna is better a lot of the foreign managers managing bigger clubs but being English will be no doubt be held against him.\n\nIn the Abramovich era Chelsea made 15 successive foreign appointments. They preferred hiring Avram fucking Grant rather than giving an English coach a chance with that Chelsea team.\n\nIf that was in Italy it would have been 15 Italian managers working with the likes of Lampard, Terry and Drogba and reaching Champions League finals and many of those managers would end up having strong reputations as a result.\n\nMany think Ancelotti is the world's best manager but at Everton his results didn't stand out. His record is similar to Moyes. If Ancelotti was English he'd probably never have managed a top club. He'd be written off as just another mediocre Brit.\n\n\"England have to hire a foreign manager because the alternative is taking the likes of Ancelotti from Everton and he's clearly shite because they are permanent mid-table mediocrity.\"\n\n[removed]\n\nCanada with an American\n\nIreland with an Icelandic manager\n\nIreland with a sober manager.  Ahoooo!\n\nDon't get this comment?¬†\n\nTurkey with an ƒ∞talian manager\n\nHungary with an Italian manager\n\nIt‚Äôs getting worse¬†\n\nEngland has had a German manager for quite a while. \n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Saxe-Coburg_and_Gotha\n\nThe thing is, if we accept such a tangential connection makes them German to this day, we also have to accept all those yanks who say they're Irish, Scottish, Italian etc. really are that as well, and I don't think that's a world any of us really want to live in :)\n\nAnd before that, Dutch and even Norman/French managers.\n\nBased\n\nUS with Poch\n\nSweden also has a Danish one. Never thought I‚Äôd see the day.\n\nIt‚Äôs really not that crazy.  If I‚Äôm in charge of any nation‚Äôs football governing body, I‚Äôm hiring the best manager available that I think can lead the team to success.  \n\nIf the FA decided appointing an English manager was required, they‚Äôd really be holding the England team back and hire just another ‚Äúsafe‚Äù manager.  Probably some former England player with a solid but ultimately unimpressive managerial record.\n\nJamaica with a fucking idiot\n\nUS with an Argie mister.\n\nand Ireland with a dentist in charge\n\nBrazil with an Argentinian coach soon? üëÄ\n\nSweden with a‚Ä¶. Nevermind.\n\nI guess it is a good move especially when they need trophies\n\nPress are gonna be ready to pounce on him for sure\n\nIsn't the king German?\n\nYes. But you don't sing 'Deutschland Deutschland √ºber alles' every time he speaks on TV\n\nOne step at a time it seems.\n\nTuchel winning World Cup with England would be hilarious ü§£\n\nThere were 10 German bombers in the‚Ä¶.. shut up lads we‚Äôre in the final\n\nDon't think I'll see that song again if we win a trophy with him out of respect for him haha\n\nThere were people singing it in the pub when we were going against Spain in the final ffs\n\nYeah I was it's a good song\n\nRemind me in two years\n\n!remind me\n\nWhy not - we‚Äôve got nothing lose.\n\nBarry saying this since ‚Äò66\n\n‚Äú2 world wars and 1 World Cup‚Äù\n\nAbout to hit different\n\nEngland Uber alles\n\nEngland Uber Eats\n\nNah mate, the lyrics are about to get an update in 20 months.\n\n3 World wars and one World Cup?\n\nGenius.\n\nI‚Äôd call Tuchel the Rudolph Hess of football but that seems a bit too far\n\nImagine the look on Hitler‚Äôs face when he comes to know that a German is managing England and a black person is managing bayern munchen\n\n[removed]\n\nWhy?

United spoke to Tuchel in the summer about the possibility of succeeding Erik ten Hag.\n\nTuchel was always been amongst the favourites for the full-time England job and, along with Pep Guardiola, was one of a number of managers to have been sounded out since Southgate stepped down.\n\nThose talks advanced quickly towards a conclusion, with Tuchel excited to return to England and work with a squad that he believes is capable of winning trophies.\n\n**Read more:** [**https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2024/10/15/thomas-tuchel-agrees-to-become-next-england-manager/**](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2024/10/15/thomas-tuchel-agrees-to-become-next-england-manager/)\n\nLike it a lot. Tuchel is an excellent tournament manager! \nGot PSG to their first (and only) champions league final, as well as winning it with Chelsea. Came within a Neuer mistake last year of deservedly knocking out Madrid and probably winning the competition!\n\nWas not expecting that! Think he will bring success\n\nEngland are gonna actually win some stuff. This guy's won the UCL, man. It doesn't get bigger than that. (World Cup don't count.)\n\nPhenomenal news for England!\n\nThat second star on the England shirt is coming.\n\n[removed]\n\nHaha, see what you did there!\n\nI, for one, oppose terrorism.\n\nChelsea being reminded of one their biggest fumbles, up close and personal.\n\nAs an Irishman, this is bad news.\n\nYup, this is concerning.\n\nAfter enduring him at Bayern all I can say is get excited for more Southgate football boys\n\nWell i didnt see that one coming\n\nLOL\n\nI think the rules for national team players should apply to the management and back office staff. \n\nWish it was a full top to bottom representation of the sporting body. And I say this as an Irish guy knowing full well our own limitations.\n\nTuchel after chelsea and poch after tottenham have never been the same\n\nTuchel just keeps failing up\n\nEngland replaced Southgate with a better Southgate...\n\nOver achieved by getting PSG to a champions league final. Overachieved again by winning it a year later with Chelsea. \n\nHis failures with Bayern were down to Harry Kane going missing when it mattered most, he does that a lot with England. Can't see this being a success.\n\nHe went missing with Tottenham too.\n\nSo has everyone since the early 90s\n\nJust when you thought England couldnt be less appealing to watch.. 12 months and he will of fallen out with every one\n\nCor blimey those bloody krauts. First the royal family, now the England footy manager.\n\nNext they'll want them playing gang gang press.\n\nI prefer Tuchel to Pep Guardiola, especially given the tactical pragmatism required to succeed in International Football and how little time International Managers spend with their players.\n\nAlso add in the fact that Tuchel‚Äôs Salary Demands were much more reasonable than Pep‚Äôs and it was clear that Tuchel would be the better candidate for the England Job.\n\nThis is 2024\n\nthe way my jaw dropped in the middle of work\n\nCan‚Äôt wait for him to fail, I can only hope he‚Äôs as bad as he was for Bayern\n\nWill he be good though\n\nNo\n\nWe win, no one cares.\n\nWe lose, oof.\n\n\nWonder how the meatheads are gonna sing 2 world wars...\n\nHe's a nice coach and it's cool that his time at Bayern didn't ruin his career...\n\nNext it'll be a Palestine manager for Israel and a Ukrainian manager for Russia\n\nGerman efficiency ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\n\nIf he wins any trophy with England, that would be ironically funny...\n\nwtf we love Germany now?\n\nOnly took the Germans 8 decades to rule England.\n\nes kommt nach Englisch\n\nThe FA has more pull than Old Trafford. Wow.\n\nWill fit in great with the victim complex.\n\nGreat manager but the worst post game interviewee of all time.\n\nHe has never lost a game because he opponent was better.\n\nNice\n\nLaughter\n\nThink of poor Winston Churchill rolling in his grave at this news üòî /s\n\nFu√üball kommt nach Haus! Drei L√∂wen aufm Nikki!\n\nIs that not a conflict of interest lol\n\nI thought we had this debate dealt with when Sven Goran Eriksson took over all those years ago.\n\nThis won't last.\n\nI wish him good luck, but I personally think that the England manager should always be English, even if that makes the national team worse.\n\nSorry guys, but I'll never recognize anything won by England with a german manager\n\nTuchel vs Poch tea party memes incoming\n\nThey went from terrorist to terrorist\n\nTuchel is a god compared to Southgate. Besides, his ‚Äûterrorist‚Äú football brought chelsea a CL title\n\nSo winning with a billion dollar squad makes it ok? I don't think so\n\nCould football be coming home??\n\nüò±\n\nMy personal opinion is that south gate was better, he took england to the finals of the euro but he also made bad decisions on benching good players the thing is that i don't think Thomas Tuchesl can achieve something like that but time will tell...\n\nHmm, a good tactician but he seems to argue or fall out with everyone.\n\n Such as -\n\nOwners, \nExecutives, \nPlayers, \nAgents, \nReferees, \nFinancial Directors, \nBall Boys, \nGroundsman, \nParking Attendants, \nClub Shop Managers, \nClub Shop Staff, \nToilet Attendants, \nShirt Manufacturers, \nShirt Sponsors, \nPoliticians, \nLibrarians, \nMexicans, \nPolicemen, \nFireman, \nDrunks, \nPostmen, \nLighthouse Keepers, \nSport Pundits, \nCarpet Fitters, \nDelivery Drivers, \nFamous Film Stars, \nMusicians, \nFarmers, \nCows, \nEgyptians, \nPorn Stars, \nReligious Figures, \nPlumbers, \nAxe Murderers, \nWindow Cleaners, \nComedians, \nDonald Trump,\nCyclists, \nCats, \nTraffic Wardens, \nBrain Surgeons,\nSubmarine Commanders, \nStar Trek fans, \nSean Bean, \nSir Sean Connery, \nPrince William, \nMagic Johnson,\nAstronauts, \nThe Tellytubbies, \nBrent Spiner, \nLiam Gallagher, \n\n\n\nAnd himself. \n\nAll in all, nothing to worry about..\n\nUnfortunately the media and racist fans will bully him out of the job after the first defeat.\n\nWhat has england become man...\n\nThis is fucking ridiculous.\n\nHow\n\nA German as England manager. I live in Germany, I'll never hear the end of this from my german friends. ü§£I can already hear the mockery.\n\"England finally won something but you needed Germany's help to do it\" ü§£\n\nYep. It's stupid. Let's bring in half the Germany players too because why not?\n\nThat mockery will be well deserved.\n\nTrue and he will get blasted for being German if they lose. But it‚Äôs England‚Äôs third foreign manager so the cultural aspect of only English managers ended ages ago. I don‚Äôt see a better candidate.\n\nSoon he will complain about not having the right players and ask FA to buy ‚Ä¶. Ahh well\n\nFuck me , another 8years not winning anything.\n\nIf there is a manager that can take England to a title its him. Besides, everyone is better than Southgate\n\nGlad he's not going to United. He actually could've improved them and instilled a bit of elite mentality. Hopefully they keep Ten Hag all season now and the comedy continues.\n\nGood hire\n\nTrent is finshed.\n\nWas holding out for Mourinho\n\nPretty embarrassing for such a huge football nation to have to hire a foreign manager.\n\nName one good english manager\n\nCan‚Äôt\n\nHahahah fair. now you know why they hired TT\n\nOf course. I was just pointing out how awful it is that they don‚Äôt have any top level managers right now.\n\nIm still mad they never gave Allardyce a chance\n\nI agree. Also, I thought Potter would have been good\n\nHowever, Tuchel is by far more experienced and proven than Potter. It‚Äôs a good acquisition"

It's not special anymore.\n\nSuperb analogy.\n\nI don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs just me but I‚Äôm really not interested in the new format at all. It feels like qualifying is now going to be basically a formality for the top teams with 24/36 going through.\n\nThe answer to the problem of 'too much football' is not and never can be, 'let's play more football' !!!\n\nIt's pure greed and over-exposure and the fans are bored and players are exhausted and the market is super-saturated. Why does the prospect of Arsenal v Atlanta in September just not now interest me at all?? \n\nThere's zero point to this qualifying round. \n\nChampions League should be CHAMPIONS of all the countries in Europe, in seeded groups. That is all.\n\nI remember Man United vs Deportivo or whoever on ITV felt like a huge event with massive stakes. There was a United vs Galatasaray game once that was literally huge.\n\n\nFast forward 30 years and im barely paying attention to the first round of champions league fixtures, I just dont fucking care.¬†\n\nI think having all the winners from all the UEFA leagues would be great. There are 31 UEFA members so maybe winner guaranteed and league where the winner is from is guaranteed 2 spots (so potentially 2nd).  \nSeeded groups or not I am not fussed but I would watch that.\n\n&gt; There are 31 UEFA members\n\nThere are 54 UEFA members (55 if you count Russia).\n\nYeah I don‚Äôt know why I thought it was 32 ‚Ä¶ just being dumb\n\nSo that the winner of either PL, PD, Bundesliga or Serie A wins it every year\n\nMight get a bit more variety with that setup, at the moment it's just Madrid and the English clubs.\n\nYea. I didn‚Äôt want to say ‚ÄúSo just Real Madrid as the winner every year‚Äù but basically that.\n\nThough if it was just champions, the other leagues would only need a couple of teams to have a bad season and we might get another Red Star Belgrade every now and then.\n\nThat time has past and is long gone - the top teams are stronger than ever and the lower leagues teams a weaker in comparison. It would be alot of 7-0 8-0 9-0 games until the low leagues are gone\n\nPeople were saying the same thing when Porto went and won it.\n\n\nThe reality is the more you make it into a league, the more likely the best team is to win because one off night doesn't put you out like it used to.¬†\n\nThat's pretty much how the competition worked in its earliest days. They were so far ahead.\n\nIt does mean that if the winners of the Spanish, German, or English league have an upset then you've got a far better chance of a totally different team winning it though.\n\nI think the answer to too much football is to promote more U21 competitions or just make competitions to expand either the conference league or a B tier world cup/Continental competition. San Marino winning its first competitive game had a lot of press not all minnow games will be like that but I think more realistic goals and competitions. Like a La liga v premier league v Bundesliga v Serie A where each team plays the team above relegation and below Europe play home and away against someone in the same spot. This year for example would've been osasuna v brighton in 11th\n\nYou'd have thought the Belgians that run UEFA would have taken advice from their countrymen in the diamond trade when it comes to artificially maintaining a high demand for a substandard product\n\nI'd prefer if it was unseeded straight knockout over two legs, only champions of domestic league, cup and defending champions qualify, and stick the rest in Europa league, stop teams settling for top 4.\n\nit was basically a formality for top teams even before though. you had a proper 'group of death' maybe once every five years? the new format looks meh, but it was kind of fun when i played it in football manager. at least top teams can't phone it in after 4 games anymore, you really want to be in that top 8.\n\nwho knows, maybe it'll suck, but i'm willing to give it a chance\n\n[deleted]\n\nPots are absolutely irrelevant since every team play against two teams from each pot.\n\nThe biggest (and potentially only) plus is that no one drops into the Europa league, which was always a stupid system that was just a get out of jail free card for if a top team or a \"Valencia\" sized team that aren't big enough to win CL but have more at their disposal than the Slavia Prague sized teams.\n\nIt feels like it is directed towards hard-core fans and (SPECIALLY) towards hard-core gambler fans. So that they have more opportunities to give money to FIFA/UEFA\n\nAlso, also, I have this conspiracy theory that UEFA (and frankly most other Football Associations) allow under-the-radar \"illegal\" streaming to boost betting. Like they know it happens, but casually most illegal streaming services have a ton of betting ads. Like, u seriously think betting apps don't give some money to leagues and clubs?\n\nNah, UEFA \"allows\" illegal streaming because they have no way of stopping it.\nIllegal streaming has a lot of gambling ads because those are the ads that offer the most money.\n\nI don't think any explanation beyond that is needed.\n\nWell, no, I seriously don't think the betting apps are paying off leagues and clubs. That would be the scandal of the century and would destroy reputations. I think the leagues and teams already make plenty of money from broadcast rights and merchandise sales, no need to put their whole livelihood at risk to take bribes from betting apps.\n\nNot really, last year United and AC Milan both went out in the group stages.\n\nThe season before that Barcelona, Ajax, Jive and Athletico went out in the group stage.\n\nSeason before that Dortmund, AC and Barca went out at the group stage\n\nThe year before that Inter and United went out at the group stages.\n\nEvery year there were a few of the biggest teams in the world going out at the group stage. All this new format does is provide them a better chance of going through and playing more knock out football meaning their gravy train doesn't stop if they lose a couple of group games.\n\nI agree. I think people are overreacting negatively because they always fear change, but when you think about it, groups were incredibly predictable and you still had a ton of stinkers in there. Now you at least have a much more varied set of matches, and for that alone I think it's already an upgrade.\n\nDota 2 just had a tournament where the group stage was only for seeding and nobody got eliminated. Naturally people didn't care and it carried over to the next stages. \n\nIt was so predictable that'd happen.\n\nIn Italy we have two different providers for Serie A and CL (DAZN and Sky). I think I'll start paying for Sky from the R16 (assuming we qualify lol)\n\n16 of those 24 will go for an additional round.  Only 16/36 will actually be qualified for the next round. I think‚Ä¶.\n\nThis new format will end up in the same trashbin as the time they had 2 group stages. That only lasted 2 or 3 seasons.\n\nFeel the same about the Euros at the minute. Group stages are so dull when hardly anyone gets eliminated.\n\nTbh it was as easy in the prior format.\n\nI contend this is a large part of what is wrong with society now overall.  The feast and famine model that was the standard before - you watch a new episode of a tv show and then you have to wait a week, you watch a new movie and then have to wait a few weeks before anything new is in theaters, when you don't see you're friends you are alone with yourself, you can be bored in between activities during the day - all these things have been erased.  Now you binge shows, new movies are released at a rapid pace on streaming, you never have to be \"alone\" with social media which is just, or never have to be bored by picking up your phone and scrolling for some hit of dopamine.  \n\nThe human experience for most things used to be a sine wave, but now its more like a horizontal line that is higher than the lows, lower than the highs, and I think due to our constant ability to always be entertained/never be bored, this horizontal line often takes a slight downward slope as we get used to constant entertainment, and the only way to fight that is the stakes have to constantly be upped because we do not allow for lull periods of boredom anymore.\n\nBeautiful comment\n\nI also follow American NFL and definitely notice the difference in a sport where teams typically still just play one game per week. Every game feels like a major event, and then you have a full week to reflect on it and digest what you saw and discuss it with friends. The average fan can realistically watch and analyze every single game their team plays. The players actually have time to recover and practice between matches.\n\nI agree, however, the 17th game and the expanded playoffs have diluted the weight of an individual game somewhat.\n\nYou are right with this one. Champions League will lose its charm\n\nThey simply want to turn everything to the Super League which was rejected.¬†\n\nUEFA's only problem with the Super League is that they wouldn't get a piece.\n\nThey got their hands forced by the Super league brouhaha. Now, look\n\nThe whole facade of the super league was to make it more palatable for uefa to change the champions league\n\nPieces of porn mags found in the woods were far better then bestmegafuckfesthardcore in hd, on your phone, in the bog, on your wedding day.\n\nJust look at the wiki article on the champions League. The first 7 headings are:\n\nHistory\n\nAnthem\n\nBranding\n\nFormat\n\nPrizes\n\nSponsorship\n\nMedia coverage\n\nWe can see the priorities.\n\nSo true.\n\nI bloody love cauliflower cheese though. \n\nI think I‚Äôve missed the point‚Ä¶\n\nI reckon I could eat Sunday dinner every night and then have pizza on Sundays.\n\nI don't know. Having a roast nearly every day doesn't sound too bad\n\nLast season their opening against Newcastle had the attendance of 66k so nothing new here. Against Paris and Dortmund it was bit better.\n\nThis is still 10k lower than that and it's Liverpool no Newcastle. That's a steep loss of interest in just 1 year.\n\nif Milan lower the ticket price the stadium will be full\n\nIf the fraud owners finally sells them to someone competent that actu1lly wants to win and understand what football is and what milan means to football. THEN the stadium will be full again\n\nGreed from UEFA. Pure and simple\n\nIt was pure greed from Milan. Their tickets managed to be more expensive than Aston Villa.\n\nWhy do you compare it with Aston Villa lol.\n\nVilla have been pulled up in the press and apologised over the last 2 weeks for sharply increasing their ticket prices for CL games.\n\nBecause that's oasis levels of price gouging.\n\nYeah, but they are still \"only\" Aston Villa with no disrespect to them. This was Milan vs. Liverpool, second and third most successful teams in UCL history playing on San Siro which is one of the most if not the most legendary stadium. Were they overpriced? Probably (didn't see price), but my point is that it's pointless to bring Villa here.\n\nThe current Villa team is probably worth watching more than Milan. \n\nMilan are a complete shadow of their former selves.\n\nThat doesn't change the fact that if you ask 100 people which match would they rather watch, 95 of them will tell you Milan vs Liverpool.\n\nIt's just a bit of a slap in the face to your fans when you're charging prices like you still have prime Kaka, Seedorf, Cafu, etc on show while you actually have the likes of Alvaro Morata, Ruben Loftus Cheek and Emerson Royal.\n\nCorrect, but Milan are still a more popular club than Villa, with more fans.\n\nMilan fan here. We‚Äôre just not interested in supporting the current management. They sacked Maldini who was leading us in the right direction and embodies being a Milanese. \n\nAnd at the moment the manager we have is bang average when we could have had Thiago Motta or Conte. We‚Äôve won 1 game so far this season and it was against 20th.\n\nZero Point going to these games until there‚Äôs changes.\n\nHow it's greed from UEFA? It's down to the clubs to put prices on tix. \nHere's my next 2 UCL games -\nCeltic v Slovan 60 GBP\nShakhtar v Atalanta 15 Euros.\n\nThis or the Super League though :)\n\nWait until some teams have guaranteed a top 8 finish then this format will really start to stink\n\nDo you have time to explain this / how? I‚Äôve tried to understand this new format but it‚Äôs complicated\n\nWell because of the increased number of teams in the single league, you‚Äôre just going to end up with a lot more games to which there is no point because there will be an increased number of teams that don‚Äôt need any more points to progress or have no chance of progressing because they won‚Äôt be able to get enough points that have any discernible impact on their fortunes. \n\nPrevious format also meant you had the ability to ‚Äútake‚Äù points from others which had a double impact - a benefit to your team and a detriment to theirs at the same time. \n\nErgo, dead rubbers aplenty.\n\nJust think of the teams that, in any domestic league, have no chance of getting a European spot nor will they get relegated so they‚Äôre ‚Äúon the beach‚Äù towards the back end of the season. There‚Äôs zero risk/reward so why bother? Teams will either put out weakened sides or just half arse it and that‚Äôs what will happen here.\n\nI think you are wrong about this, because it's not only about points.\n\nA win nets a team 2.1 millions, a draw still 700k. Just to put that into perspective: That's roughly what the clubs get if they win the austrian league. The whole fkin league, and they can earn as much on a single evening, up to eight times. It will be similarly important for all other small clubs, smaller leagues or clubs who are on a run like Atalanta, Girona or Leverkusen. \n\nMost of the teams will always be motivated to give their best, because it can make a 16 million euro difference on their bankroll, out of which parts will make it to the players in form of bonuses.\n\nI'm not sure how the table will develop, but there should still be attractive football being played up until the last day.\n\nThe main financial problem is that an increased number of games won't matter to television watching (and to an extent match going) fans, not the clubs themselves. This whole expansion is about getting more eyeballs on the tournament. Bluntly put, if you create a less compelling tournament, people have less motivation to watch.\n\nI don't see where you are coming from. We need to make a distinction: Actual fans will still watch and follow their teams. It doesn't matter where they are positioned in the table, they will still support their team no matter what. Best examples for this are teams like Union Berlin last season.\n\nThen you have casual fans, who only care about good and decisive games. While the amount of games that will be interesting for those will definitely decrease towards the end of the groupstage.. it will never drop to 0. There are more than 8 good teams who want to fight for the top 8 spots. \n\nSo I don't really know where you are coming from. Of course the median experience will \"decrease\", simply because you have more games now, but that doesn't mean that the peak level changes. \n\nPeople *will* be interested in seeing who will top the table, and that team will have a strong character arc which will pull even more viewers into the knock-out stages. Imagine the marketing you can do around a team that beats everyone, or in an even better case wins all games/remains unbeaten throughout the league stage and is being hunted now by the rest of europe.\n\nImo you're focusing way too much on the bottom end, but that's not where this competition takes place.\n\nYeah, money for the teams. Players won‚Äôt get any of it, so they won‚Äôt care, really.\n\nSounds a bit silly.\n\nEven if we assume you are right and they receive 0 bonuses, then those are still their moments to shine on an european stage.\n\nNobody is watching Zagreb, Young Boys, Donezk or Bratislava in their domestic leagues. If you perform well in the CL, then the chances are high you can get a good move. Best example is Kopenhagen after their run in the previous season. [They generated more revenue with sales than ever before.](https://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/fc-kopenhagen/alletransfers/verein/190)\n\nTaking into account that player careers are short and this might be your only chance to shine on a big stage for years, then there isn't much that's supporting your point. Players are training day in day out, just to live their dream and you expect them to not give a fuck and leave that opportunity to level up their career on a silver plate? Sure..\n\nAh yeh gotcha thinking about it the ‚Äòtaking‚Äô points element is relatively dead now - and thank you!\n\nNo worries. There will still be a few instances of \"6 pointers\" where two teams who are relatively close to one another in the table play each other later in the schedule. Not sure people will care too much about them though if the outcome is that Team A finishes in the seeded playoff group or in the unseeded playoff group and thats it.\n\nYeah, even teams that had had a disaster in previous CL campaigns would generally push until the end to perhaps ensure 3rd place.\n\nThis'll be like American sports, where poorly performing teams just drop tools 2/3rds of the way through a competition (due to no relegation, and no chance of making play-offs)\n\nBasically what the others said. Once you‚Äôve guaranteed top 8 you‚Äôve got the other games off so can field whoever you want. You‚Äôll also get games between two sides already eliminated which is even more pointless.\n\nI don‚Äôt know if there‚Äôs seeding for the knockouts or what. I imagine the top 8 won‚Äôt have to play each other in the last 16 just to make sure they really crush the magic of cup competitions in favour of the rich clubs.\n\nWho the hell has guaranteed top 8? Bayern Munich?\n\nThey didn‚Äôt say that any team has already a guaranteed spot. What they are saying is something like, when you got enough points to guarantee a spot on the 8 (around 15-16 points) the remaining games don‚Äôt matter that much.\n\nProblem is you \"don't know\" and \"imagine\" but still have strong opinions about it. Same as most in here who haven't understood or tried to, but comment like they're top analysts.\n\nThis format is much more competitive, games and points are not a lot for one table of 36 teams,there will be many ups amd downs in every gameday, and it's not about simply qualifying but final position matters a lot for the knockouts, and teams will be very close, so this year even goals matter, not just wins. This format will be miles ahead in terms of interest and drama in the final day.\n\nTeams will rest players as they will have secured top 8\n\nits very hard to secure top 8\n\nThanks! That‚Äôs gonna be so dead\n\nThey also rested players when top 2 was secured.\n\nDisagreed because it's better to be 4th than 5th, 8th than 9th, and so on.\n\nEverybody will have something to play for, except once they can't mathematically be at least 24th any longer.\n\nGiven that 6 points might be enough to be 24th, that means that at most a couple teams (like 3 or 4 out of 36) will have nothing to play for in the last match, and every single one should have something to play for up to the 7th match.\n\nMuch less dead rubbers than in the previous system \n\nNow is this new system mostly motivated by greed? Obviously! But that's unrelated to whether top teams won't bother for last games (they shouldn't)\n\nFwiw I've played this format a lot on Football Manager these past few years, and it's extremely difficult for a top team to be guaranteed a top 8 finish prior to the final 1-2 games. A few teams might succeed each year, but a large number will be fighting the 3-14 spots. In the current format big teams often play their backups the final 1-2 games too.\n\nOf course real life is not a computer game, but at least just from a numbers standpoint, getting top 8 is harder than it might seem at first.\n\n[deleted]\n\nlast year copenhagen only had to win two games to get to the round of 16. Now youre just going to see the exact same teams every year because those teams get higher international viewership which makes uefa and their advertisers more money.\n\n6 points might be enough to go to the playoffs ( granted, that's a ro32, not a ro16) here too : I think simulations show it should be 7 points most of the time, but crucially, that's out of 8 games, including 2 against pot 4 teams\n\nAlso, there are more small teams that get to play the group stage, and I think that's great.\n\nUEFA wanted more big matches out of greed, and they did get it, but at the same time they gave small teams more chances to play for something IMHO\n\n(Small teams are going to get eliminated before the ro8, but it was already the case before)\n\nThe point is that, even if most groups were decided going into the final round of games, there were always at least one or two matches every night that genuinely mattered. Good teams almost always had a real chance of being knocked out.\n\nNow the jeopardy will be whether they have to play an extra knockout round\n\nI have to admit: I didn't even realize that Champions League had already started until I saw the memes this morning\n\nSame...then I saw the new structure and lost even more interest.\n\nyeah this new format is making me less likely to watch it. also fuck paying sky, bt, amazon or whoever the fuck owns champions league football nowadays, costing me nearly ¬£100 for my cats haircut - moneys too tight to mention nowadays.\n\nYup I was browsing my feed on my commute home and was like hmn.\n\nWhat team do you support?\n\nWhat nonsense, we've only had one game and some teams haven't played yet. I don't know if the new format will be a success but it'll take years to make that judgement, at the moment everything has been identical to any other season\n\nIt‚Äôs only been one match day\n\nEmpty seats for certain clubs, but club like Bratislava, Red Star, were absolutely delighted with these formats\n\nIt has always been about money for these associations whether it be UEFA, FIFA, CONMEBOL. They say they are thinking about the fans bringing more pure and joy instead all they care about is filling their own pockets.\n\n Overpriced tickets aren‚Äôt really Uefa‚Äôs fault though are they? \n\nA lot of the issue is that clubs look at every game as an opportunity to maximise matchday revenue despite the fact that they‚Äôre already making record breaking figures from broadcast and sponsorship\n\n15 Euros I paid for UCL game in 2 weeks. Shakhtar v Atalanta. So, ticket prices are nothing to do with UEFA. \nPaid 60 quid to see Celtic v Slovan Bratislava tonight:)\n\nDortmund V Celtic ‚Ç¨45\n\nI think Germany is probably the best in Western Europe for fitbaw ticket prices! Lucky yous!\n\nAre we really gonna pretend that the group stage wasn't boring as fuck outside of the odd group of death for well over a decade? I'm not sure how this format will play out once we get into the thick of it but I'm willing to give it a chance first. People really just lose their heads over any kind of change.\n\nYup, people put on their blinkers because it‚Äôs a requirement to be outraged online. But pretty much nobody was watching the group stages anymore. They were shit. Let‚Äôs at least give this one a chance. And to criticize based on the attendance of the first game is ludicrous. Someone was just looking for confirmation bias.\n\nThe thing is, I have my own reservations about this format, but for me to consider them to have any kind of merit before it's even had the chance to play out would be, as you say, ludicrous. Nobody knows if this format is shit or not because it hasn't happened yet. When did we become so obsessed with having an opinion on everything with no reference points?\n\nI liked the \"boring\" group stage where every game was important and it felt exclusive when you got the draw against another top team in Europe that you had to play home and away. If you play them every year it quickly grows boring. Just like playing a World Cup every year would be boring.\n\n***Telegraph Sport's Oliver Brown writes:***\n\nLittle can dilute the San Siro‚Äôs distinction as a soaring citadel of the game, a monolith whose giant concrete towers and protruding red girders often strike terror into the hearts of opponents. Except this enfeebled Milan team are ill-equipped to match the grandeur of their setting. Essentially a collection of Chelsea cast-offs, they have such scant hope of adding to this club‚Äôs seven European Cup triumphs that the loudest sound they elicited from the Curva Sud on Tuesday night was a shrill chorus of contempt. By the time Dominik Szoboszlai guided in a volley for Liverpool‚Äôs third, the place was half-empty.\n\nOnly 55,000 tickets have been sold, 16,000 fewer than for last Saturday‚Äôs Serie A game against Venezia. It is not quite the image Uefa had in mind when the draw brought two of the continent‚Äôs three most-decorated institutions together on the opening match day.¬†\n\nThe first act of a transformed competition should bring a breathless atmosphere of renewal, not a bleak sense of ennui. But the abiding impression of¬†[Liverpool‚Äôs routine 3-1 victory](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2024/09/17/ac-milan-vs-liverpool-live-score-latest-champions-league/), at the expense of a fabled enemy, is that Uefa has watered down the ingredients vital to the Champions League‚Äôs allure.\n\nTake jeopardy, for instance. Under the old six-game group-phase format, teams would have a fair idea in September that 10 points would all but guarantee qualification for the knockout stage. Now they have no clue, with a¬†[sprawling mini-league](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2024/09/16/champions-league-draw-when/)¬†lasting until late January and only 12 of 36 teams eliminated without the chance of a play-off, how many will be sufficient. And so, just as Liverpool‚Äôs win was light on outright euphoria, Milan‚Äôs defeat could hardly be considered terminal. Such is life under this strangest of systems, where the imponderables outweigh the certainties.\n\n**Read more:** [**https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2024/09/18/pricey-tickets-empty-seats-uefa-dilutes-champions-league/**](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2024/09/18/pricey-tickets-empty-seats-uefa-dilutes-champions-league/)\n\nskirt birds fine panicky waiting smoggy gray axiomatic punch cooperative\n\n *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev/home)*\n\nTo be completely fair, Milan's ticket prices were absolutely diabolical. I don't think we can put out a verdict on this format after literally 1 day of games. \nI'm not the biggest fan of the new format either, but give it more than 1 gameday to put out a final verdict on it.\n\nI like the new format. So far, all matches have been quite good, even if a bit unbalanced. Until now, the group stages were meh, some teams were guaranteed to qualify even with a mediocre performance, if they had an easy group. Now, teams have to actually give it their all from day one.\n\nReal v. Stuttgart was entertaining af.\n\nMan City vs Inter is like watching paint dry. The only thing worth noticing in this match is the horrible Man City shirts.\n\nThey need to admit this was a huge mistake and change the format back next year.  I'm not even excited to watch\n\nHonestly the old format got boring too. It‚Äôs not the format but the amount of teams in it. That said I can‚Äôt say it‚Äôs a failure just yet\n\nThe gulf is getting bigger and bigger between the big 4 and everyone else. Should stop the stupid 4/5 places for big leagues and let bigger teams with smaller TV revenue in. I'd love to see more of the legendary teams from mid sized leagues.\n\n\n9-2 last night was just comical.¬†\n\n\nEuropa is the real champions league. Most in the \"champions league\" aren't even champions.¬†\n\nFirst and foremost: lower the absurd prices and you will fill a stadium up in a blink of an eye, it's got nothing to do withmatches being boring.\n\nAlso, I don't get people's opinions on this... the previous format is an absolute perversion of what a Champions League should be. It was made for the rich clubs to stay at the top.\n\n* 4 and even sometimes 5 teams from a same association is an absolute joke - it's way too easy to get in the champions league. This has repercussions like players wanting to play for the Tottenham's of this world rather than a Red Star or an Olympiakos - one wins nothing but has European football every season, the others need to play a gazillion qualifiers to get in despite being chronically dominant in their respective domestic fronts. I guarantee you that if only the 1st of every league had access to Champions League, we would have a much better balance in the leagues. \n* a very sad thing I see nowadays is Prem fans being asked whether they would rather win the Prem or the UCL, with many saying the Prem....how can it even be a difficult choice? Before the only way to win the UCL was to win the league first, so there was no question, but now teams get a shot at the UCL when they shouldn't.\n* Another garbage feature from the previous format is teams from association can't be drawn together? This essentially is a free pass for top 5 leagues to reach the last 16 unscathed. \n* of course there is the whole pot BS as well. So not only are English, Spanish, Italian, German clubs avoiding European giants for free, they are also drawn with worse teams. Again, they get a free ride to the last 16. \n*It is astonishing to see how low the percentage for teams winning both their respective league and the UCL after is. Ot means most recent winners shouldn't have even participated in the competition in the first place.\n\nI also don't get why people say this new format is boring and that playing big matches too often is going to suck. How many tomes have I not seen a Liverpool vs Real Madrid game in the Final or Semis these last seasons? We had a repeated final in 2014 and 2016. Same in 05 and 07. 09 and 11. Remember when Bayern vs Arsenal was a thing? Or Bar√ßa vs PSG. Real won it 3 times in a row ffs. It was always the same ones bros. \n\nPeople don't dislike the format, they just don't like change, which is absolutely fine. Just don't use the new format as an excuse.\n\nOne of the principle drivers of this new champions league format were the clubs themselves so it is what is: \n\nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61388244\n\n[removed]\n\nTrue and I think people forget how a lot of group stage games were really dull and had little to no jeopardy\n\nThe champions league exists because of money, if it didnt we would still have the european cup. So its a bit late to yell at that cloud. \n\nAlso, as someone who doesn't support a team who gets European football and so I am a neutral, the group stages were boring every year without fail, this format is more connected, more varied and therefore more entertaining. People love to moan about any change or anything new because thats what the world is now, a bunch of moaning wankers\n\nCan we call it what it actually is?\n\nThe super league\n\nIt‚Äôs not though.\n\nGoing that way tho with some top 5 league clubs getting 5 and possibly even 6 CL tickets is completelly absurd\n\nThe key complaint people had about the SL was the lack of a need to qualify. Top 6 is still something that a team needs to reach if they want to be in UCL.\n\nFinish 6th - in automatically. Win your league - rounds of qualifiers. It is heading towards the Super League.\n\nYes but super league rules would save seasons for Chelsea, United, Napoli, Lion , Valencia,Sevilla and Roma and punish Girona, Aston Villa, Brest, Bologna, Atalanta...\n\nI love your username ‚ò∫Ô∏è\n\nIt won't happen because sponsors want a format which guarantees the big clubs stood in front of their branding but cut the games down and go into a cup format. Gave 1st round seeding or something and go from there.\n\nFewer games and bit more variety. Of course it's anathema to sponsors so won't happen.\n\nCan‚Äôt blame UEFA. The super rich clubs are to blame because they threatened to leave and make their own league.  Maybe all of you should stop routing for the soulless clubs like Man City and PSG that have their status due to money and money only.\n\nTbf the old champions league format was fucking shit. Hardly ever many exciting games until later on in the competition and by that time it's just the same seeded teams getting through every year. I hate seeding in sports let's stop favouring the teams who are already better than the rest\n\nIf you support a club from a lower league like Greece, every game is important. It's only the top clubs that have the \"boring matches\" problems\n\nWhy are newspaper accounts posting on Reddit so frequently?\n\nClicks\n\nZero cost, and they can appear to still be relevant.\n\nThe real madrid farmers league has been boring for a while. Its a shame for this once beautfiul competition\n\nFirst game of a new format and it's already being shit on? Who's having a go at it? Ohhh, The Telegraph? Nothing to see here then.\n\nHi /u/TheTelegraph, this submission is waiting for moderator approval, before it can appear on the subreddit.

But I guess that was a seeding problem. \nWe can complain about greed but that‚Äôs how the champions league and the premier league was formed in the first place for the bags of money it generates. \nFIFA and UEFA and other football bodies are practically a syndicate of football heads who live for the money.\n\nFirst time?\n\nit should be just the champions of each league‚Ä¶.\n\nthat's how it used to be\n\nyeah and it was great\n\nDefinitely preferred the old format but not as angry about the new one. Feel like we should give it a few years before we can really judge the format. For now it sounds decent, lower teams get to play others at their level and have actual chances to progress\n\nUEFA have always been greedy. It's shocking how their greed is now getting out of hand.¬†\n\nWhere‚Äôs the fun in biscuits when there‚Äôs always biscuits?\n\nWhat did a ticket to San Siro cost yesterday?\n\nI like the new format but the lack of sold tickets is surely do to something else.\n\nThis is completely on Milan though. Make the tickets reasonably priced and they will sell out easily\n\nNot sure what input UEFA had on Milan‚Äôs ticket prices\n\nUEFA and FIFA‚Äôs greed is slowly ruining football. More unnecessary games, stupid major tournament formats in multiple countries. Fuck them honestly.\n\nWhat a surprise\n\nDidn‚Äôt even realize champions league had started this weekend until I got notifications.\n\nUEFA changed format due to threat of a super league helmed by Florentino Perez. Many rich teams will opt out of UCL and join the super league.\n\nTerrible format\n\nIt should be a straight knockout competition.\n\nGambling is about to get even more lit\n\nI still find it funny how angry UEFA got over the idea of a Super League and how it was going to ‚Äúruin football‚Äù. Now we know it never was about saving football, it was about money and greed.\n\nBut how to make the competition more interesting? Draw out all teams from 1 pot?\n\nThis is an article from the telegraph. Who are they quoting? Because I take that outlet with a pinch of salt. \n\nAll I know is, I enjoy the games and the stadiums do not look empty at all. The only issue I agree with is overpriced tickets. \n\nOther than that, this seems to be a take from an old dog that hates to see any change happening.\n\nNFL about to do this with all the games being spread.\n\nMaybe Real Madrid winning over and over again does not help.\n\nNot ready to dump this baby out with the bath water just yet.\n\nHonestly the old format wasn‚Äôt even that exciting itself but this new format (as with pretty much every change in football) is just another way of trying to ensure the biggest most marketable teams appear in the most watched glamour fixtures.\n\nWhat would happen to football if the fans went on strike ‚Ä¶ you know everyone just fuck it all off for a few weeks.\n\nNo attending of football matches, no watching on tv, no buying kits or merch. \n\nFootball is boring as fuck now.\n\nFollow non league instead\n\nI feel like it‚Äôs just delayed the actual ‚Äúchampions‚Äù portion. Like you‚Äôre running the magic and diluting the flavor.\n\nI really don't care for the champions League anymore why can't we just have 4 teams in a group round of 16 quarters semi final final like\n\nUsed to watch nearly every single UCL match but I don't think I'll watch until the knockout round now\n\nBut the super league was supposed to be the bad guy\n\nThe Champions League would be waaaay more exciting if it was straight knockout from the start with no seeds. \n\nWould be epic actually.\n\nThin end of the European League wedge.\n\nAnd it's LIVE!!!!\n\nIdk what ticket prices were but what I can confirm is that Madrid vs city in the CL last year was cheaper than a QF MLS playoff game.. if they bumped prices I don‚Äôt have a ton of sympathy\n\nTotally not an NBA format clunky ripoff\n\nwow\n\nWow\n\nit was really weird seeing the stadiums not being full\n\nThey've ruined the champions league. Effectively all the group/league game don't matter anymore. Competition is not worth paying attention too until the late stages now. If they wanted more games they should have gone back to the two group stages. That imo was the ultimate way to do the UCL.\n\nEveryone needs to chill out.\n\nAll this just to see Madrid win again? I‚Äôll pass.\n\nIf you don‚Äôt love the history of Bratislava vs Celtic. Then you just don‚Äôt love football.\n\nIt's the second group phase, second edition. Nobody was interested in that either.\n\nPersonally I have zero interest in the new format. Life's too short to watch Europe's 10 best clubs smash 9 past minnows.\n\nMake the Champions League a proper elite competition. Reduce the number of games and make it a worthy spectacle.\n\nMore is not more good.\n\nI actually like the new format\n\nDo you think that UEFA was against the Super League not long ago? No, they were against not being included in it, at its wheel. Now you do, this is the super league, my friends, and is just the beginning.\n\nYep they fucked it. Under the guise of bigger teams will play each other more often. But what they have really done is diluted the importance of each game just to line their own pockets. Also im not really interested in watching my team play a team they will beat 9-3\n\nA lot of people would gladly go to the games if they didn‚Äôt cost half a kidney\n\nI think the San Siro attendance had less to do with the new format and more to do with Milan fans not wanting to watch their sieve defense get torn apart\n\nIt‚Äôs exactly what the Super League would have been. Champions League is just a side show to proper football in individual countries leagues. People really don‚Äôt want too many meaningless so called glamour ties between supposed European giants. Just a stupid ‚Äòmerican accountants view of what the ‚Äòbusiness‚Äô of soccer is. Fuck ‚Äòem, they never consult with proper fans. Absolutely fuck them .\n\nTbf uefa doesn't set the ticket prices. I actually like this format more, but it should have been 6 group games, not 8. Then there's real jeopardy in every match"

Lol\n\nIm german myself, and I‚Äôve seen more attractive people in the us than im Germany\n\nfirst time i saw him i legit thought he was american or canadian\n\n the germanics and Scandinavians are very good looking and all of that side of Europe going eastwards\n\nVichy France?\n\nIIRC his father has German ancestry and his mother is Portuguese, so there‚Äôs no ‚ÄúFrench gene‚Äù.\n\nI mean do most 33 year olds in good shape look that much worse/different than they did at 27?\n\nI think he does, not like 20s and 30s is a big difference anyway\n\nNaaah Frenchies don‚Äôt age well, rich people do\n\nIsn't he Uruguayan\n\nHalf Portuguese half Mat√©\n\nProbably bc of his haircut styles.\n\nHe still looks young, there's no doubt about it but when you watch him play, you will notice his age is telling.¬†\n\nHe is one of the exceptional players in the France Squad unfortunately, old age comes for everyone.¬†\n\nPretty great internatIonal career for him tbh\n\nThat‚Äôs an understatement tbh\n\ntbh\n\ncrowd cautious knee carpenter possessive bake narrow connect lavish sheet\n\n *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev/home)*\n\nThe streets will never forget Adolf Griezmann \n\nAlmost conquered Europe in 2016\n\nConquered the World in 2018\n\nConquered a bunch of nations in 2021\n\nAlmost conquered the World again in 2022\n\nBeen one of French best players since 2016 tbh\n\nFor him to win the World Cup is a very good achievement because there are some great players who never managed to Win It.¬†\n\n[deleted]\n\nHow many players win the World Cup while being an essential player?\n\nexactly\n\nTop 3 main player of his era for national team (arguably even any era tbh), drove them to the final in 2016, drove them to win a WC in 2018, drove them to a final in WC again, etc etc.\nGriezmann is the most influential national team player of his generation, regardless of nationality. Him and Deschamps are the 2 main reasons why we‚Äôve been so successful recently; and yes, before Mbappe. \nSource : I‚Äôm French and have watched probably 95% of their games since I was 5\n\nHolds the assist record for France?¬†\n\nMade multiple finals as a player‚Ä¶\n\nNot sure what else he could really do better.¬†\n\nNations League if you count that something.\n\nbest euros performance in the decade by a lot\n\nWtf are you saying, he has basically been the second best national team player of the past 10 years after Messi and even higher than Neymar or Mbappe\n\nAfter Messi?? He is the best national player last 10 years way better than Messi. Top 3 in 3 international tournaments.\n\nLmao. \nMessi took Argentina to 8 finals. Won everything there is to win. He won the player of the tournament 6 times.\nIs the top scorer and assister for Argentina.\n\nGriezmann has none of these things. Its not even close.\n\nLol..He is a complete failure in Copa America which is a weak tournament. The three teams that can challenge Argentina.. Brazil, Uruguay and Chile ( now Columbia) he never had a great performance. It's a two big match/ one match tournament for a team. He failed in 15,16,19  clearly and had worst performance in 21 final.24 too he was weak vs Columbia .Griezman in Euro 16, a way big tournament had greatest performance in Euro after Platini and Zidane. See the SF vs Germany and QF etc how competitive was thier opponents. Then in 18 he was motm both Final,QF, did defensive well vs Belgium the biggest challenger and okk is r16. In 22 even though WC was weak they had 2 big challengers England,Morocco Griezman individual performance beat them. Messi won the weakest WC ever with half dozen softpens that all team presses for him and cover up spaces  vs Griezman is best defensive contributing forward, the big chance creator ,the glue of team and contributes well in g,a. Messi winning 14 golden ball doing nothing in k.o makes it clear how biased it is. International Griezman&gt; Messi.\n\nThis is such a bs argument I don't even know where to start. Lets look at objective facts and stats first-\n\n\nGoals for national team - \n\nMessi - 109\n\nGriezmann - 44 \n\n(This alone is such a huge difference that this should not be a conversation. If you multiply Griezmann's goal tally by 2 and then add 21 more goals you get Messi's career goals.)\n\nAssists -\n\nMessi - 55\n\nGriezmann - 38\n\nAgain, even as the better scorer, Messi also has assisted more. No argument.\n\n\nPlayer of the tournament for national team - \n\nMessi - \n\n2 √ó WC golden ball, 2 √ó Copa golden ball (refused to take the third one), U-20 WC golden ball, Finallisma motm, best player at Olympics 2008\n\n\nGriezmann - 1 √ó Euro Golden ball.\n\nAgain, landslide margin. No debate.\n\n\nFinals with the national team - \n\nMessi - 8\nGriezmann - 4\n\nAgain, point Messi.\n\n\n\nMessi has won everything there is to win as a national team player. WC, Copa America, Finallisma, Olympic Gold, U-20 WC. And he played with a mediocre Argentina team for most of his career. Griezmann on the other hand could not win an Euro final against a Ronaldo-less Portugal. \n\n\n&gt;Lol..He is a complete failure in Copa America which is a weak tournament.\n\nThis is the most absurd thing I have ever heard. Messi had 9 goals+assists in two separate editions of copa americas (4 goals and 5 assists in 2016 and 5 goals and 4 assists in 2021). In 2021 Messi won the copa america as the potm, top scorer, top assister, most freekicks, most chances created, most dribbles completed and most motms. This has never been done in international football hisotry. And there were other players like Neymar, Suarez, Cavani, Sanchez and James Rodriguez among others. \n\n\nMessi won the WC in 2022 as the only player in football history to score in every round and win motm in every round. Even without penalties he had 6 goals+assists in 7 games. And before you bang on penalties, Argentina scored 4 penalties on their way to WC victory in 2022 but so did France in 2018. Argentina were given 2 penalties against them in the final but France had 0 penalties given against them all tournament. So miss me with that bullshit. \n\n\nMessi won the WC with the weakest champion team in the 21st century. Compared to the legendary Brazil (2002), Italy (2006), Spain (2010), Germany (2014) and France (2018) team, Messi won with a 34-35 year old Di Maria, a midfielder from brighton, a keeper from aston villa, and a striker from the argentain league. When Griezmann won the WC France had enough world class players to make 3 different teams and send them to the WC. In every position they had 2-3 wc players. It would have been a surprise if they did not win the whole thing. Messi had magical moments all throughout the tournament- the tournament saving goal from outside the box against Mexico, 10/10 performance vs Australia scoring the opening goal and creating half a dozen chances with magical dribbles and passes, magical assist vs Netherlands, magical assist vs Croatia, brace in the final vs France. Messi's 2022 WC alone is better than Griezmann's entire international career.\n\n\nBtw, Messi also has the most goals+assists in WC knockout history. Griezmann does not. Not even close.\n\n\n\n&gt;Belgium the biggest challenger\n\nLMAO.\n\n\n\n&gt;with half dozen softpens\n\nNot only are you intellectually dishonest, you are also factually just plain wrong. Show me 6 penalties and I would concede my arguments. And fyi, if a team commits 5 fouls inside the box in a game there should be 5 penalties. Doesn't mean the referee should not blow the whistle. This is football 101.\n\n\nGriezmann has always been a choker. Choked in 2 UCL finals both in 2014 and 2016. Choked in 2016 Euro final. Has been playing in Spain since 2010 but has 0 la liga trophies to show for it even though Atletico has won 2 in the mean time. \n\nMessi has 6 trophies for Argentina. Griezmann has 7 in total for both club and country combined in 15 years. It is laughable.\n\n\nSo yeah, apart from, \"GrIeZmAnN iS bEtTeR bEcAuSE Mah fEeLiNGS\" there is nothing much to go on. If we start a poll in this subreddit your opinion would be ridiculed to death.\n\nMessi instead has been top 1 in 3 tournaments and top 3 in another two, so yeah I wouldn't count on that...\n\nCopa doesnt reach half Euro level so leave. WC 14 golden ball robbery. First time a player who did nothing in k. O getting that. WC 22 Messi is top 3.Its 3 vs 1\n\nHe‚Äôs 33\n\nHe is 33 until he is 34\n\nHe‚Äôs a lot nearer to 34 than he is to 33 and that‚Äôs a fact\n\nIs\n\nSome players even retire before they are up to 33 years old. He has already given his best.¬†\n\nAll these guys had a secret paxt at the Euros to retire and not bother wait until 2026. Alot of them are happy with 2-3 WCs on their resume and have no interest for more.\n\n1 WC is enough for great international career, let alone 2 or 3\n\nEspecially if you won it\n\nWon\n\nZut\n\n2-3? They only have 1\n\nWho else is left from their WC winning squad? Mbappe, Hernandez, Pavard and Kante?\n\nKant√© probably won't make it to 2026 either. \n\nLucas Hernandez has terrible luck with injuries so there's a decent chance he'll miss it too. \n\nSo it's Pavard, Mbapp√©, Areola.\n\nDamn that‚Äôs wild how different the roster is compared to 2018\n\nA lot happens in a 8 year time span\n\n2018 was pretty different from 2010 so it makes sense.\n\nIt would be 8 years. It‚Äôs 6 and change now.  Fairly normal turnover.\n\nDembele but he was a sub. He only play one game iirc on 2018\n\nThat's it for the starters yeah\n\nOne of the cornerstones of the French attack for quite a few years now. Barely missed a game. There have been a lot of quality forwards for France over the years and you could make the argument that Griezmann has done more for the team than any other\n\nGutted to say it as a Madrid fan because of his antics sometimes. But he's solidly a top 3 French international player ever. Mbapp√© will surely surpass him now that he'll lead the team alone but it'll be a great loss to them, like Benzema was throughout his career.\n\nmbappe won‚Äôt surpass him in terms of importance\nto the national team imo. Griez had absolutely insane performances for france throughout and was arguably their best player in every single major tournament except maybe for the latest euros\n\nHe might have stickied around till next wc if he was made captain but now I think he doesn't got any desire left in him\n\nI thought it was such a shame that he didn‚Äôt get the armband. Obviously Mbappe is going to get what he wants but being the best player isn‚Äôt the same as being the best leader.\n\nGriezman was the best player not Mbappe both in 18 and 22. The hype superstar status made chaos. France is done without Griezman\n\nGreat international career. Don't think France will struggle to replace him with the staggering amount of quality players they have running around there.\n\nA weaker France is good for the rest of us, though. So here's to hoping this hurts them a little bit.\n\nReplacing grizzy is no joke man. That guy literally saved deschamps so many times. A player with high iq+tireless stamina is rare and combined with goalscoring is nasty as hell. \n\nNow atleti will surely miss him.\n\nHe's a great player no doubt about it, but France have such an insane embarrassment of riches that I don't think this moves the needle all that much for them.\n\nI hope it does. My country hasn't won anything in forever, and while that is mostly due to Spain, having a weaker France around never hurts our chances.\n\nThey do and have to be careful utilising players. Grizzy is like all in one player.\n\nWe're missing creativity, since Pogba left he's been more or less the only one capable of it, and I do expect this will be a struggle for a while. No one in the euros team will bring that, maybe Olise can but I haven't seen him play enough and Nkunku is too fragile / hasn't been convincing when he's played.\n\nI don't know if it's such a big hit for them. They've still got prime Mbapp√©, then there's D√©mb√©l√© and Barcola...\n\nDembele and Barcola are nowhere near the class Griezmann was on, to even compare them to Grizzy is an insultüò≠\n\nBut Barcola can still be...\n\nSure he can but I just don't think his work morale is nowhere near what grizzy had. But he's surely talented and could potentially surpass him. I just doubt it a lot.\n\nYou got the one who controled everything since midfield to attack, which would make runs to get the ball on defense retired. And then you are talking about Dembele who doesnt move his ass from the attack side, misses 10/11 of the shots and scores 1/20 chances. Barcola its the same as Dembele. Wtf are you guys smoking comparing those two attackers with the guy who was running the game?\n\nOh, my bad, I should have added Za√Øre-Emery, Tchou√°meni and Camavinga as well.\n\nNone of them does Griezmann's work. Tchouameni camavinga are almost just defense focus. Zaire-Emery can be a good call but for now he's mediocre at max. Of course, they can just not play the way they were used to with Griezmann, but It will take time for France to adapt their game, lets see how they do it...\n\nBarcola is not the same as Demb√©l√©..what ? I do agree it's a very different type of player compared to Griezmann though, not a playmaker. But Barcola defends a lot and doesn't miss nearly as much as Demb√©l√© does. He just hasn't quite yet proved what he's made of, that's the problem.\n\nYeah, hence me saying they won't struggle to replace him with the wealth of talent they have. But a boy can dream and I sure hope this hurts them.\n\nWhy he retired from international?\n\nHe hasn‚Äôt shared, but his close friends (Lloris and Giroud) retired from the NT already, he was snubbed for the captaincy and he is asked to play lower in the midfield which is exhausting and it might be frustrating to him.\n\nThanks for the memories French Totti\n\nMaking Mbappe captain was a mistake.¬†\n\nWas just fking weird when you had a guy who gave always his everything and single handedly carried France through 2016 euro final... And then you have a superstar name and boom, captain. Wtf, no... Imagine Ronaldo captain over Sergio Ramos, lol. Unacceptable\n\nExactly. The National team must feel like a wierd place to him right now.¬†\n\nYh, its just sad\n\nRonaldo, completely oblivious on when to take a well timed exit, congratulates himself in the mirror for sticking around longer.\n\nWho the fuck talking about Ronaldo on a greizzman post? lmao\n\nSeems like Cristiano is living rent free in your head.\n\nCome um cagalhoto\n\nAnd here you are, thinking about Ronaldo all the time. You might be in love with him\n\nO homem n√£o te paga o sal√°rio. Relaxa\n\nBecause he is not a quitter .You hates him for trying .\n\nhe makes his team worst, thats the problem\n\n The last of the french players\n\nWeird timing to be honest, but I‚Äôm sure he has his reasons\n\nMore games nowadays\n\nNo one can be perfect! The best message for retirement would be \"thanks for your service\" not \"why did you fail to ......\"\n\nNice player overall\n\nHe's offered what he had to do for his nation. Just wish him the best\n\nGood, now the Netherlands can finally win something for once\n\nOne of my favourite players ever, one of the few attacking players that can slide tackle well LOL\n\nMy day is ruined\n\nI thought he should‚Äôve been the one to take the captain‚Äôs armband from Lloris\n\nAny reason? Seems a little out of left field\n\nMany feel he's been unfairly treated by Deschamps, he's expressed that idea too. Something probably happened between the 2\n\nNGL I wouldve left the minute they made Mbappe captain\n\nThank you Mbappe\n\nAbout to take over the Yu Gi Oh world by storm\n\nHe was the last white guy in French team right ?\n\nMLS here we come\n\nHe would have stayed if Deschamps knew how to manage players like him, giving the captain role\nTo Mbapp√© was a huge mistake, Griezmann deserved it and is our only real creative player in midfield. I‚Äôm just happy to have watched him win just seems early for him.\n\nMeanwhile Pepe‚Ä¶\n\nNoooooooooo\n\n**MERCI** Griezou üëè\n\nThank you Griezmann!\n\nThank you for your contribution to the France National Team Antoine Griezmann. Happy retirement.¬†\n\nHe could have played at least 1 more, maybe 2\n\nArguably the best French player since Zidane\n\nAG is soo young. Still has a lot to achieve\n\nNo videos?\n\nWould you say he's a top 50 player all time? I think he's level with Gerrard, David Silva, Pirlo and Lampard, and probably just a tier below Kroos, Xavi and Iniesta. I'm mainly comparing him with midfielders since he was primarily in a #10 role throughout his career\n\nEasily a top 50 player of all time. One of the most versatile players ever as he was also very good in defense and his work morale was very high. One of my favorite players of all time and I would put him even in the top 30 greatest players of all time.¬†\n\nBut I think it's stupid to try and compare players to different times and positions and more suitable question would be: Where would you rank Griezmann in his own time period?¬†\n\nI would definitely rank him at least a top 10 player in the world compared to players in similar positions from somewhere around 2014-&gt;¬†\n\nYeah fair although I think we can go farther back than 2014 when comparing players. I personally wouldn't go farther back than my own frame of reference which is 2006ish. From what I've seen, Greizmann is definitely a top 10 midfielder in the past 20 years. The only midfielder that I would say is definitively number 1 is Modric.\n\nThat's definitely too much, also because some of the other names shouldn't be in the top 50 too, but for the top 100 why not?\n\nYou yanks and your incessant rankings seriously\n\nYou think it's just Americans that do this? Lol\n\nyes, americans and kids\n\nüòÇ this is good banter ngl\n\nüò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠\n\nOne of the more memorable players I‚Äôve seen. I remember doing his goofy phone celebration when I was a child.\n\nSee, that's what u should do Ronaldo.\n\nWho am I kidding, Ronaldo would first burn the Portuguese team to the ground if it meant one more record for him..."

What a moron‚Ä¶\n\nVAR check...its on the line.\n\nThe line was wrong\n\nIt was ket. Makes sense\n\nHe was caught offside\n\n VAR check‚Ä¶ nose is just over the line.\n\nGood process!!\n\nit's clearly a Dog so..\n\nI'm beginning to love this guy:\n\nHates the scousers\n\nLikes recreational pharmaceuticals\n\nYou‚Äôre my boy blue!!\n\nHe told the guy at the end to not film it, so it should be all sweet. üëç¬†\n\nBut not as dumb as the hockey player who filmed himself in a similar situation and then *posted it on his instagram*\n\nIt's caster sugar. He's got diabetes so he can't eat sugar anymore, so this is how he has a sweet treat.\n\nI have heard the suppository method is better. Something to do with refs having their heads up their arses.\n\nAnd they don't mind causing a stink.\n\nWho let Dermot Gallagher on here\n\nHow stupid is this guy.\n\nHe definitely needs to rethink the people he allows himself to session with. What a pack of snitches.\n\nAfter one video I thought that but with two completely separate videos that would lose him his job it‚Äôs more likely he‚Äôs just got a drug problem\n\nYeahnah he's just a mad sesh monster¬†\n\nHis \"mate(s)\" still royally fucked him over regardless of whether he likes the packet or not.\n\nIt‚Äôs kind of fucked how his so called mates have basically ended his career and cost him likely 100s of thousands if not millions in future earnings. \n\nThis could also very easily impact his marriage if he has one. \n\nI‚Äôve known a bloke who can‚Äôt get enough coke when he goes out and has sworn to his wife he doesn‚Äôt anymore for example. \n\nI don‚Äôt condone the behaviour or the lying to his wife. But I also don‚Äôt think people‚Äôs lives should be ruined for this sort of mistake.\n\nSure but also he knows this stuff is career-ruining if it gets out and he still made vids of it. Don't fuck around if you're not ready to find out.\n\nI don‚Äôt know about you mate but I‚Äôve said and done worse things than have been shown on these videos.\n\nThe difference is I wasn‚Äôt filmed or if I was my mates haven‚Äôt shown the world, or if they did no one gave a shit.\n\nAnother difference is that you don‚Äôt officiate the premier league\n\nDo you have a high profile job where it‚Äôs a given than you‚Äôll be a national scandal before you lose said job if you get caught?\n\nHonestly I'm in favour of people being able to make choices, I'm also in favour of those choices being transparent.\n\nIn the case of the guy you mentioned, I think his wife fully deserves to know, and if it ends the marriage, so be it\n\nyes\n\nQuite\n\nThat‚Äôs him sorted now. Say he is an addict and needs help. Thats why he was saying those mad things about Klopp, didn‚Äôt know what he was doing. Losing his job will send him further down that path\n\nPaid suspension for the rest of the season except during Liverpool games!\n\nNeed to give him the chance to redeem himself, don't we?\n\nNo fuck that turd. He is easily replaceable. This is the perfect chance for new referees to join the EPL.\n\nExactly, there's a pool of excellent officials working in the Football League ready to step up    /s\n\nEveryone is acting as if Coote was on Pierluigi Collina‚Äòs level üòÇ\n\nTbh I'd not heard of him before all this!\n\n*that‚Äôs him snorted now.\n\nMissed a sitter there, he did\n\nThat‚Äôs out of line..\n\nI mean to be fair, you could tell he was on something on that video, but he was also showing off. Obviously wasn‚Äôt expecting it to be shown to Joe Public. Like you say though, will plea that he‚Äôs an addict and all will be forgotten about soon\n\nHaving read that book, you'd be needing a sniff just to get your head straight¬†\n\nSpat me tea out‚Ä¶ cheers for that ü§£ü§£\n\nI wonder who he's pissed off.\n\nHaha yeah, this feels like blackmail and he called their bluff or something. It did take a while for the first video to be posted after it happened.\n\nManchester City.\n\nAt least Robbie Fowler only pretended to do it\n\nLoooool whoever is leaking these vids absolutely hates his guts. He must‚Äôve slept with someone‚Äôs missus.\n\nThe first video was definitely a malicious leak. \n\nThe second is probably someone trying to make a quick buck of something they would never consider sharing before now.\n\nSo turns out one of the worst referees in the blue riband league in the WORLD is a beak head.\n\nYou could tell from the last video. Man was nailed.\n\nFucking fool get him outta here mate.\n\nNow it al makes sense re the Germany - Spain match.\n\nHe was the VAR - high as a kite and missed the penalty.\n\nFucker cost us the Euro title.\n\noh shit now I remember. I knew before the game that there'd be shenanigans once I saw the ref team\n\nI actually meant this as a joke but - the guy very specifically called  Klopp a ‚ÄúGerman Cnut ‚Äú.\n\nSo I wonder a) how sure are we he wasn‚Äôt on coke during the match and b) what‚Äôs his problem specifically with Germans?\n\nI think this warrants an investigation.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMowg6\\_CaAA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMowg6_CaAA)\n\nPoint taken.\n\nDamn I thought this was real. I know you clarified it in another comment but at least put /s here at the end of the actual joke\n\nSome people say it‚Äôs real, some say it‚Äôs a joke \n\n/s\n\nI thought they couldn‚Äôt draw lines?\n\nIronic the weapons grade pearl clutching from football fans who likely spend their weekends sniffing coke and calling people cunts.\n\nEdit: I'm not defending him, I just don't think it's as big a deal as many are making out\n\nAre those football fans also linesman for the most watched football league in the world?\n\nWho are making wildly biased statements about clubs and players? Idgaf what he does but I do care what he does if he is going to continue to ref.\n\nYour attempt at making this incident sound important hinged on 'most watched'. Won't someone think of the viewers?!\n\nBut seriously, if you see Coote thinking that Klopp is a cunt for being abusive as a sign of corruption in refereeing ‚Äî then you simply can't be reasoned with. \n\nIs Coote someone we should like? Doesn't matter. Is he corrupt? Probably not. Is he an idiot? Most certainly.\n\nI don't necessarily think corruption is the correct word, if it affects his decisions then maybe but I bet most refs think a bunch of players and managers are cunts. He's entitled to his opinion but he's also a fucking moron for filming this stuff.\n\nCalling a team shit is a sign of bias tho. Uncorrupted person with such opinion would decline refereeing of Liverpool matches and matches of Liverpools direct rivals.\n\nHow you can look at these absolute blurts who ref the game in England and have any sympathy for them is beyond me. They are succubus, absolutely shite at their jobs and face no competition for their lucrative job or consequence. Managers lose a few games and at most clubs they're finished.\n\nThis gonk is picking up 100k a year, not including match day fees, for being absolutely shite at his job and in the meantime getting off his face whenever time permits. He's the kind of dweeb who films himself on the bag and sends it to someone.\n\nOf all the people in the world to stick up for and you choose David Coote, bit of a contrarian are we?\n\nCan you please define a succubus for us, and explain how referees play the role of a succubus within football?\n\nDavid Coote is a demon that assumes female form to have sexual intercourse with men in their sleep. Didn't you know?\n\nJust a bit of hyperbole. Referees have not improved in line with the premier league. The constant influx of the best foreign coaches, players and the endless stream of foreign money through club ownership and TV deals has made the Premier league the place to be. Some say the best league in the world for entertainment. Most people involved with the Premier league earn huge sums of money because of the money generated by players, they all have roles that they play and something that they offer and bring to the table.\n\nReferees since the inception of VAR only offer controversy and incomptency, they offer little back to the game and benefit massively in a financial sense. \n\nPlayers play badly and the next contract will not be as good as their current one, or they won't have a club. Managers lose games and they lose their job. Refs who are cosistently terrible are feted as the best in the business, Howard Webb was fawning over Michael Oliver not long ago who has made some terrible mistakes in the last season or so whilst also reffing games in the Middle East and taking money from Man City owners.\n\nWe are not contratrion, precious. We are not sticking up for him. I just don't think it's a bad as people are making out, and you and many others are on their high horses. \n\n'Refs face no consequence'. Wow. You just said that. \n\nSuccubus, blurt, gonk, dweeb, who's shite as his job. This was all you in one post. \n\nMake a wrong decision these days and you're the enemy of thousands of people. Your poor decision is analysed again and again in the press, your integrity is questioned, and you're called every name under the sun on social media (your selection listed above)\n\nHonestly man, it's attitudes like this that lead to refereeless games. Like poor football decisions are a crime.\n\nIf he's not doing coke while officiating I don't see the issue.\n\nIf thousands of kids round the country had posters off Coote round their bedroom I'd argue he's failing as a role model. But it's sort of his job to be hated as a ref so nothing lost there.\n\nIf this was a clip of him calling a friend a cunt, no one would care. Probably wouldn't care if he called a celeb, politician or the queen one either. \n\nHe called a manager he's reffed several times a \"German\" cunt. While coked up. That is completely out of line.\n\nHe seemed very much on the line imo.\n\n\nI'll see myself out.\n\nAutographs will be 20 quid üëè\n\nIf all the football fans you know snort coke in the weekends, you‚Äôre hanging around with drug addicts.\n\nCoke isn‚Äôt just a fun hobby you do on the side, it‚Äôs an actual addiction that has destroyed millions of lives, and this whataboutism doesn‚Äôt have any bearing on whether Coote should be refereeing or not. \n\nI just don‚Äôt understand how you think your comment makes sense. 99% of football fans don‚Äôt do coke, why‚Äôre you acting like it‚Äôs a common thing? \n\nHaving opinions on a coach is whatever, letting someone film you insult a manager when you have the power to control their games and seasons, while being high off your mind from Cocaine, is another thing, because it brings your impartiality into question. It makes you seem biased. It casts doubt on calls made that affected Liverpool in negative ways, because rather than just being seen as incompetent, there is now the possibility of it being completely on purpose due to a bias or as part of a blackmailing scheme. \n\nIf videos circled around of you calling a high level customer/employee a cunt, telling the cameraman that this video shouldn‚Äôt be released, meaning you‚Äôre aware you‚Äôre being recorded, and then another video of you filming yourself doing coke, you‚Äôd literally be fired on the spot. There would be no excuses for you, you‚Äôd be completely fucked in an instant.\n\nI haven't defended him - I think Coote will be fired, as would I in his situation. Nice whataboutism btw. \n\nI'm not making light of cocaine use (high horse much?). And it is more common than you think. And in Coote's situation, if it was severely affecting his work, his job would have been on the line before this. \n\nThe 'whatabout' point I'm making is that that drugs and drinking don't automatically make a person a completely untrustworthy, corrupt scumbag. Which is what many are essentially saying.\n\nThis guy gets cooler by the day\n\nDavid Coote ü§ù Adrian Mutu\n\nI do love a decade + age old reference\n\nPlease god FA just give him another Liverpool game for the absolute banter and let him give their opponents a 90th minute penalty\n\n[deleted]\n\nwe aint got a problem with him, just its unhealthy to referee while being on drugs\n\nSeems like someone has a vendetta against this guy. Man City's owners, perhaps? They've done worse.\n\nIt's called having a \"mate\".¬†\n\nThis guy rules\n\nTell me about it\n\nHates Liverpool, thinks klopps a wanker, loves a trip to Thailand, gets on it when the opportunity arises\n\nHow is he not most football fans messiah?\n\nHe committed the unforgivable sin of being a referee.\n\nCorrupt ref is still a corrupt ref. Nobody wants that\n\nHe's definitely made public his huge bias and should never ref a professional match again, but I don't see any corruption... unless I missed something.\n\nFilming yourself. That Ebang Engonga vibes.\n\nElite reference\n\nTerry Hayes will be delighted by the free advertising!\n\nThis guy must have pissed off a good friend for all these videos to be surfacing.\n\nCan never trust a bag head.\n\nOk now this is something worth talking about.\n\nWhat a fuckin idiot\n\nahahah get fucked\n\nHe let people film it!! This is the part I don't get. Literally you are in the public eye. He's a right spenk!\n\nThe great David Coote is innocent. This man is simply ingesting, likely, sugar. How dare you lot berate this great man.\n\nThese are the videos they hold over peoples head to get them to do what they want.\n\nWhy do people film themselves doing coke, I don't get it at all.. who wants to see it\n\nFew more referees need to be investigated. Anthony Taylor. Paul Tierney, Darren England.\n\nOh no Anyways!\n\n\"He was eating the grass.\"\n\nDavid Toote\n\nGet him on big brother rn\n\nI bet if you ask him, he also won't remember this\n\nRobbie Fowler must be proud\n\nWhat‚Äôs all these dubious activities coming to light of all these football refs lately?\n\nOG Ma boi\n\nDavid Toote\n\nSo i was right, the 4th offical was high for not giving the Cucurella handball\n\nPGMOLlie\n\nHe was working VAR that day, give the lad a break\n\nReal video?\n\nGots to get those B vitamins somehow!\n\nI feel the need to make introductions ‚Ä¶. ‚ÄúSmoke this is Fire, Fire meet Smoke‚Äù ‚Ä¶\n\nAnthony Taylor is apparently next.\n\nI wuz hacked\n\nWe all thought the refs were high, this just confirms it\n\nI love how the article is calling the source his \"pal\" whilst terminating his entire career\n\nAlso, fuck Coote.\n\nHe can twist this to work in his favour. \n\n‚ÄúI said all that stuff about Liverpool and Klopp because I was high, didn‚Äôt know what I was saying I‚Äôm a drug addict it‚Äôs not my fault‚Äù \n\n6 months of rehab and support later he‚Äôs back to his job.\n\nHe can twist this to work in his favour. \n\n‚ÄúI said all that stuff about Liverpool and Klopp because I was high, didn‚Äôt know what I was saying I‚Äôm a drug addict it‚Äôs not my fault‚Äù \n\n6 months of rehab and support later he‚Äôs back to his job.\n\nTbh he probably has a really good birds eye view of the games, given how high he is all the time.\n\nCould tell he was coked up in the vid chomping about Klopp. Grew in confidence being on camera, loving the attention.\n\nHis friend is a snake. May there be a plague upon the house of his friend.\n\nI do wonder who he pissed off to have both videos leaked within about a week of each other. Also, is there anything else that will be released?\n\nNeeds to evaluate who he's kicking about with, bunch of grasses clearly\n\nlink\n\n4-year doping ban?\n\nHe should be permanently sacked from Refereeing all together cause what he said was unacceptable\n\nWell if he is in the grip of addiction then that changes things I think. Lets be honest, we all thought the first video was barking mad, *too* mad in fact.\n\nüôÑ\n\nMandatory drug tests soon then?\n\nSomeone has snaked on him badly here‚Ä¶ has he rifled their mrs on the side or something?\n\nCooked.\n\nHis career coming apart faster than Diddy lol.\n\nDid he have a falling out with his friends or something??? Damn üòÇ\n\nDrawing lines of his own now.\n\nDo they not drug test the referees?\n\nSad Price is Right noise\n\nAnother case of lets ruin my life by \"Hey lets do drugs and film it\".\n\nPablo Escovar\n\nWiesn koks\n\nCareer absolutely over.\n\nI think this now able to be a Netflix special. This keeps getting wilder lol. Why ever film yourself doing drugs! Public eye or not that‚Äôs like 101 shit.\n\nThis man filmed his own demise that's crazy\n\nDavid Armando Coote\n\nHe should be forced to move to MLS for using a USD.\n\nHell ya. Thats my linesman!\n\nIf this is from 2020 like the other video then we have an interesting situation.\n\nThe FA, Premier League and PGMOL never criticised him BEFORE these videos came out. So we have to assume they were pleased with his performances as ref? Putting the Klopp video to the side, they can't suddenly say \"Drug use could potentially lower the quality of his performances as a match official\".... But they didn't. Otherwise there would have been an investigation prior to this (which if there was then I apologise).\n\nSo it comes down to a purely PR decision. What \"Has to be *seen to be done*\"- that awful, awful phrase. \n\nIt's going to be a bandwagon and pile on for Cootes now even though in practical terms nothing has actually changed. I do think that having an opinion about people that screamed at you and called you things is very different to someone saying they \"Just don't like 'em\" and all people in professional positions where they have to be the adjudicator in something will have opinions about people they have to work with. 95% of the time these people are simply professionals who can do their job without those opinions effecting their decision making. People believe they can- that's why they were given the job.\n\nDo you think a Jewish judge has feelings about a Neo Nazi they have to sentence? But they are professional so will treat the prisoner like anyone else and try to be. That's the job.\n\nI mean I see nothing wrong with any of this\n\nThe only reason we are hearing about this so late is VAR was checking\n\nIt‚Äôs definitely getting out of hand now. And I hear there may be more videos. Yikes.\n\nEnd of the road for Coote\n\nDavid Coote with the new Career speedrun World Record.\nIt was a very close competition but his cocaine strat gave him the edge over his opponents.\n\nHe clearly has an irrational fear of Liverpool FC, a bit like the rest of the UK football community, face facts though he is a Coked Up referee who opened himself up to blackmail and cheating and all his shit is deservedly coming back to sting him.\n\nAnyone who can't see that David Coote needs to be banned from ever reffing another game either doesn't care about the integrity of the game or is a complete moron. Or maybe both. Too many people lacking morals and integrity these days.\n\nIt should be obvious what the big problem is with a ref calling the Liverpool-manager a German cunt while \"we hate Germans\" is shouted in the same video, knowing that ref had Manchester United all over his Facebook profile in the past too. And I really doubt Coote is the only one. He's just the dumbest one.\n\nAnd for what it's worth, I really dislike Liverpool.\n\nImagine trying to use this footage in court to prove criminality. It could be anyone. Yes he's a moron for the Liverpool comments and I'm not defending him but we are taking a bum rag of a newspaper's word for it. ü§∑\n\nWho cares? Every man and their dog does coke these days\n\nFoote the hoot\n\nAren't coots those birds with the white beaks that go all the way up to their foreheads? Apt.\n\nThis is getting hilarious\n\nAnd he‚Äôs not even the worst of the refs, wonder how much Taylor or Oliver does in a day‚Ä¶\n\nOkay this guy needs to be banned from football forever\n\nCoote is a mad lad\n\nsomeone's in love wit da cocoh\n\nHe crossed the line and then sniffed it after.\n\nThere‚Äôs definitely a gay blackmail element to this. Watching the video they do not seem straight at all.\n\nI‚Äôm not surprised look at the fucking size of that thing. Lads got a face stuck on his nose.\n\nMore to come on the weekend according to Popbitch:\n\n  \n\"Just who has it in for Premier League ref David Coote? He's already on a yellow card for slagging off Jurgen Klopp and snorting something suspicious on video. But we hear that the real red card material is being lined up for the weekend...\"\n\n  \nHope there are people around the guy and he's not looking at the news for a week or two\n\nAnd ... there we have it, the state of referees in the UK. It's not even the taking of drugs, but filming it - an absolute fuckwit.\n\nDamn this guy rules\n\nWhere's pierluigi collina when we need him, such refs will be put in line with that guy(ik he retired, so don't come after me)\n\noh\n\nCool, how‚Äôs the book he reading?\n\nJust me who hasn‚Äôt seen the video\n\nThis is quickly turning into a witch hunt, the guy is going to be hounded by the press for a long while. I hope mentally he can handle it."

    "all_comment_text": "UEFA were never against a super league. They were against a super league they couldn't control\n\nWasn't this model done specifically to avoid the big teams from forming a superleague by introducing more matches , giving them more control of the revenue and making it less possible for big teams to be eliminated in early stages?\n\nSame reason the initial champions league rebrand happened in the first place, to prevent a breakaway.\n\nSuper league teams: we will leave unless you make the CL look more like a super league. \n\nUEFA: fine we don‚Äôt see a problem but ok we‚Äôll change it for you so you‚Äôll stay\n\nSuper league teams: see gullible idiots online it‚Äôs uefa who want the super league, they‚Äôre just as bad as us!\n\nThe fun part is the super league teams were the major force behind the new look cl and still tried to leave\n\nIf I remember correctly, some people were talking about a conspiracy that the whole ESL thing was planned so that when UEFA introduces their new format, it won't lead to much outrage as it'd look like the lesser evil as compared to ESL.\n\nI don't believe it but idk why, at that time, it was at least interesting to think about lol.\n\nBut without a doubt, the new format is another ESL under UEFA's control.\n\nYeah cause nothing screams more than ESL than slovan bratislava or sparta praga..\n\nI don‚Äôt think the Spanish clubs would still be hanging on to the ESL if it was some sort of bluff. Especially if they spent, I presume, a lot of money fighting UEFA in court. \n\nThe problem I have with the UCL is that the channel it‚Äôs on in the UK at least is so expensive. It‚Äôs also, and this is completely my opinion so feel free to disagree, lost its appeal. Most games are boring and one sided\n\nI believe that what made UCL popular was it was on free to air TV - so everyone could see it - versus the behind a sky paywall that was the premier league. It's why I think the FA should have kept all of the FA Cup on free to air. That gives it great exposure and will heat that competition up again. Cause if fans care - clubs care.\n\nYeah when the UCL was on ITV (pretty sure) it was amazing\n\nYeah but that‚Äôs how you get the weak minded, offer first for free and then when are hooked, charge them 79.99 a month.\n\nRemember ucl nights on ITV....was so good\n\nAmazing times\n\n&gt;UEFA were never against a super league. They were against a super league they couldn't control\n\n\n.\n\n\n&gt;UEFA: fine we don‚Äôt see a problem but ok we‚Äôll change it for you so you‚Äôll stay\n\n\nYour own comment is exactly what the guy you're replying to is saying.\n\nIt really isn‚Äôt \n\nhe‚Äôs saying this is what uefa wanted all along. I‚Äôm saying this isn‚Äôt what they wanted but they were forced to change by the threat of clubs leaving\n\nHe's literally saying UEFA were not against the idea of a super league, but they were against losing control.\n\nAnd I‚Äôm literally saying the opposite UEFA were against a super league and were forced to make changes to the champions league to avoid losing the super league clubs\n\nThat's not saying the opposite.\n\n\nIt can both be true that UEFA opposed the super league out of self interest *and* that they've made the UCL more like a super league to avoid losing clubs.\n\n‚ÄúUEFA opposed the super league of self-interest‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúUEFA were never against a super league‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not saying the opposite‚Äù\n\nü§¶\n\nAh I see now. You don't understand the difference between ***THE*** super league and ***A*** super league system.\n\nAh I see now. You don‚Äôt have the critical thinking ability to see the difference between somebody arguing in bad faith that UEFA‚Äôs CL reforms are their attempt to make THE super league their own because there is practically no difference between the two, and somebody arguing that was never the case and UEFA‚Äôs hands were forced to modify the Champions League because otherwise the super league clubs would create the super league: that UEFA were not trying to create A/THE super league at all. You only have the comprehension skills to understand different articles A or THE and not consider the material differences between what two people were arguing.\n\nI'm surprised nobody remembers what the Super League ever was, Google is not a new technology and I'm assuming everybody in this thread lived through its unveiling.\n\nIf it didn't completely fall to shit instantly, it was the most obvious of walled gardens with the \"Top 4\" of England,Spain, Germany, Italy, &amp; PSG. They all rake in the TV deals they'd cut for the people that need it the least, they all leave the UEFA competitions, domestic competitors intentionally left out still asking for leniency from their FA if they're facing administration.\n\n\"Top 4\" can only be used here loosely because the criteria of whether they could join the club is 1) Are you big club today? 2) were you a big club 10 years ago? 3) Are you a rich club? No programming software needed except for bottom bitch elitism.\n\nCry babies cry. You're all ruining the planet by raising the earth's sea level and its for stupid reasons.\n\nThis is exactly what it is and all that it ever was for them\n\nI think the fans were against a super league more than anyone because wtf\n\nThis is the real truth on what went wrong with it. They needed to control it but it wasn't possible at the time.¬†\n\nI said this when it initially happened. Only hate and hostility was Met and I wish people could have seen it at the time.\n\nA super league they didn't get a cut from.\n\nRight on the spot. They are not interested in loosing the cow to others get the milk.\n\nEvery CL format change since the early 90s has been a compromise by UEFA to avoid a breakaway \"Superleague\".\n\nEvery time there‚Äôs a change of format it‚Äôs the same thing. More places for the top countries and/or a bigger share of the prize money for the top countries. \n\nIt‚Äôs absolutely ridiculous that the champions of country #14 have to come through three qualifying rounds now, while you can finish fifth in one of the top countries and go straight to the group stage.\n\nSo the breakaway is not necessarily a bad thing. Top teams play in the Superleague, while the rest have more opportunities to play in the Champions League.\n\nBut tottenham are better than the champions of country #14...\n\nPushing all the money and resources to the top leagues will make that argument true.\n\nBefore that happened Europe was way more open.\n\nOnce great teams from Belgian, the Netherlands, Portugal, even Italy becoming effectively feeder clubs to the likes of Bournemouth and West Ham is an indication that the powerbase is completely screwed.\n\nIf we go further back you had the likes of Steaua Bucharest, Crvena Zvezda, Ferencvaros etc. being European powerhouses, but all the resources have been pulled up towards the top 5 leagues for decades now.\n\nAll three teams you mentioned were the powerhouses in Eastern Block/Soviet countries (Romania, Yugoslavia, Hungary). They invested A LOT in sports, as they thought of them as an integral part of a society‚Äôs identity. After the political situation changed in those countries, things changed dramatically, therefore the limited resources\n\nThank you for mentioning this. Its a very overlooked reason why the Champions League is only really competitive between the Big 5 and a few other Western European clubs. Eastern European clubs could compete when they had the massive state backing during the communist regimes. Now that that‚Äôs gone and been gone for three decades, it would take massive socioeconomic changes for them to compete again.\n\nThis is true, but it's not solely the politic change.  You only have to look at clubs on the western side of the iron curtain.  Anderlecht, Ajax, Benfica, Celtic etc.  All teams that should be peers of the top English sides, if not feared by them.\n\nHow long the 'Big 5' lasts is open to question.  Outside the PL, it only seems to be a handful of Spanish sides, PSG and Bayern that have comparable resources.\n\nThat was the argument behind the Super League to allow such clubs to overcome the financial limitations of their leagues. From that perspective, a new CL doesn't allow them to fight the gap. Still, not enough matches to compensate for it and the lack of regularity hinders the chances of any newcomers from the top 5 except England.\n\nNeither Bournemouth or West ham have played in the Champions League so you can't attribute their financial clout to that. It's the strength of the English Premier League that pushes them above virtually everyone else outside England apart from 10 or so others. \n\nIf smaller countries leagues want to compete with England they need to; increase their populations to 50~ million, change language to English, be willing to pay ¬£60 a week for a ticket or ¬£100 a month to watch on TV, have hundreds of millions of people across the globe who also want to watch and pay for it, sell your soul for money. \n\nEasy enough really.\n\nYeah, I drifted there. I wasn't suggesting that CL money had enriched those clubs.  I'm lumping all the post 92 business over sport decisions together.\n\nItalian big teams becoming a bottom feeder to midtable PL teams is one of the big reasons for the super league in the first place. The non PL teams wanted to compete with the PL, which is leaving the rest of the teams in the dust¬†\n\nBut the champions of country #14 have won something.\n\nIf the champions of country #14 were so good why haven't they been promoted to the premier league /s\n\nthats exactly why the money shouldnt go to tottenham\n\nThat's what happens when you push all the prize money to the same countries for 30 years, yeah. Ajax were a powerhouse and now it's a miracle if they reach the semis like they did in 2019, same goes for Porto and Benfica, and they're not exactly from small footballing countries, so imagine how bad the situation is in like Turkey or Switzerland in comparison if they even have to go through the playoffs\n\nI mean thats not champions league money as much as it is premier league and sponsorship money. Sure the Champions League has had some effect on it but the difference in league money is super dramatic\n\nI don't think thats the point... And most teams can beat most teams on the right day btw...  \nI've seen danish teams beat PL-teams a number of times...and may I remind you of Sheriff Tiraspol's match against Real Madrid?\n\nYeah but that's like saying pissing yourself is better than shitting yourself¬†\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm not a spurs fan üòÇ\n\nNot if you let them play more often..\n\nIt will bring visibility, sponsorship, fans, entries, new deals, for champions of country #14.. Let's then see if they couldn't be superior in the game..\n\nWhat do I think of this argument? SHIT.\n\nLmao they even mentioned it in the skit.\n\n150 games to go from 36 teams to 24.  \n\nCrazy.\n\nIt‚Äôs all about that sweet, sweet ad revenue\n\n144 games (8 match days of 18 games each) to go from 36 teams to 24, or 160 games (+2 x 8 playoffs) to go from 36 teams to 16 - right?\n\nWait until you hear about the premier league.\n\n380 games to go from 20 teams to 17.\n\nCrazy.\n\nAnd then they‚Äôre replaced by 3 more! Mental.\n\nOnes a league the other is a cup\n\nMaybe the Champions LEAGUE is beginning to live up to its name.\n\nBeat me to it\n\nYou don't go from 20 teams to 17 in the Premier League! After the 380 games, you have a champion!\nIn the Champions League instead, after the 144 games, the league format stops almost like if it never happened, especially for the stronger teams which would definitely be among the 24 qualified, and then a cup format starts to decide the champion. Do the two cases look the same to you?\n\nAll American professional leagues have always had playoffs before they crown a champion, and aside from the Premier League, they are the richest professional sports leagues in the world, and the fans do not complain.\n\nThe baseball team I support, the Florida/Miami Marlins, won their two national titles (1997, 2003) despite finishing the regular season a long way behind the division champions both times, and the 4th and 7th best records overall, respectively. Nobody complains that they didn't deserve their titles.\n\nIt's the same reason why playoffs were introduced into the promotion races in all the lower divisions of British football -- it keeps more clubs interested in the final goal of the season for longer, ensuring larger crowds and more revenue.\n\nIn reality, the fact that in the new league format for the UCL each team only plays 8 out to 35 possible opponents, the US style playoff structure makes a lot more sense than in the Premier League where everyone plays everyone else.\n\nAt least UCL qualification still requires teams to perform well in their home country leagues. The main problem with the Superleague was that the top clubs were breaking away from the current structure and forever bolting the door behind them.\n\nWhich is not true, because the Superleague agreed to change its format, thus participating clubs would qualify to it exclusively through national leagues.\nSo? Why don't we still have a Superleague?\nObviously, that was not the real problem for UEFA...\n\nThe fans had a problem with the super league because of no promotions/relegations. This meant that the top league was just an elite club with lifetime memberships. At least in the current league set up clubs like Leicester City and Union Berlin have a chance to ascend to the top, get a slice of the TV rights money pie of premier league/BuLi and get to raise their ticket prices legitimately. Were this super league to form, it would naturally replace the premier league in earnings and this would simply make its members stronger and every one else weaker (as if the current imbalance isn't bad enough). Not to mention, a league made entirely out of 'big' clubs will definitely not have any financial restrictions and no smaller club will be able to retain their best player...\n\nThis UCL still allows all top tier clubs a route into it, so it definitely is not that similar to super league.\n\nThe problem is that now it's rather an illusion than a real chance for clubs like Stuttgart, Bologna, Girona, and Brest. Just a nice bounty for a good season but not a strategic boost in the club's development. But at least they dropped all benefits from being seeded so the chances will be more equal.\n\nThere is no real chance for those clubs to catch up no matter how you format the Champions League. The big clubs are built on years of massive revenue disparity and there is no catching them even if they take a step back just look at United.\n\nThe disparity is unfixable unless you go American style and distribute funds more evenly.\n\nAlso drawing a game is now less valuable, a lot of smaller teams that go on deep runs are enabled by group stage draws restricting their opponents points tally. Pragmatic clubs like Atletico for instance arguably have a harder path to the knock out stages\n\nHow does the new format make it harder though?\n\nThey didn‚Äôt have a chance anyways\n\nOh the line of this, clubs like Bologna lost all their top players, so even if they had a ‚Äúchance‚Äù, they can‚Äôt really compete at their fullest, is true that all teams change each year, but 9/10 times smaller clubs sell all their good players right after the CL qualification.. so it‚Äôs a never ending loop, thanks god there are teams like Atalanta that could finally change that, but it‚Äôs a very rare breed of a team.\n\nThe illusion of a chance is still better than no chances at all. \nUnfortunately, wherever money is involved, this is the best you can get. Clubs like Chelsea, Man City and PSG can keep buying surplus players in the same positions and top players from clubs like Bologna and Brighton will still go to the big club where they aren't going to be guaranteed starters.\n\nThey're not owed anything\n\nI think the last proposed super league was really a closed shop though, wasn't it? This one has teams having to qualify through their leagues instead of it just being the big teams in it, no matter how they perform in the domestic league.\n\nYeah, it's completely different from the proposed SuperLeague. While one can complain about the extra 2 games per team in an already exhausted calendar (but that's not mandatory, the Conference League had a similar change and has a similar system but without added games), the rest of the article is complete bullshit. Especially, the author seems to have failed to understand that ending 1st instead of 8th or whatever influences the teams you're going to get in the knockout stage, so there's actually way less dead rubbers\n\nThe only comparison being that teams play in a larger group than before?\n\nTeams aren't breaking away from their native leagues to form a new European league. Teams still qualify via their native league positioning and via qualifying rounds. The only difference to last season is that instead of 8 groups of 4 and home and away matches against each side, teams are given 8 opponents to play a single game against.\n\nIt's also less weighted in the top teams favour because everyone plays two teams from each pot. Psg got a way harder draw than most of hr pot 4 teams for example.\n\nIt's more random, PSG as you said were unlucky but Bayern had a decent draw\n\nTeams were never breaking away from their native leagues. They were leaving the champions league, that's why UEFA were so annoyed, now they're just doing the same thing but keeping the money themselves.\n\nThey likely would have if the Super League had been a hit. They would have wanted to add more teams and more games until eventually playing domestic football aswell would have been untenable. \n\nIt might have taken a couple of decades, and it may cause a big legal fight, but that was ultimately the goal. Growth. You don't do it all at once, you do it bit by bit.\n\nRead past the headline....\n\nI did, it's lazy reporting, typical of a Telegraph 'journalist'.\n\nThe point of the Super League was a cash grab by the major sides by forming their own separate competition, away from the governing bodies.\n\nUEFA expanding the Champions League by 4 teams and reformatting it to accommodate has nothing to do with the European Super League.\n\nThe Telegraph is basically the Mail with words over 2 syllables these days\n\nIf you read the article, it makes no comparisons to the Super League idea.\n\nSo you're flailing at the headline still.\n\nSo Lazy journalism then? Make an outlandish comment to stir anger and fail to prove his point. He makes vague comparisons about the giants of European football but misses that this is governing body controlled. Typical tabloid behaviour, all about selling content and profit, not responsible reporting.\n\nAs I say, the new format has nothing to do with the European Super League. Again, I did read the article.\n\nJust ignore the headline then? It was probably decided on by an editor not the writer\n\nSo it has a terrible, misleading headline and all the issues that people had with the Super League aren't relevant to this? That's not lazy journalism?\n\nMy question is: if you only need to finish in the top 25 (out of 36) will the best teams just get enough points to qualify and then play their reserve teams for the second half the group stage?\n\nIf there is no danger of the big teams dropping out, will they even try?\n\nI think the first 8 team go to 1/8 Final where the teams from 9 to 24 play 1/16 Final, if they get through they Will play against the first 8 teams, all teams will aim for the first 8 places.\n\nI think the top 8 are seeded for the round of 16 no?\n\nYep, the other 16 are playing a play off\n\nPossibly for the last two games if they don't feel like they are in the running for top 8, but no manager or team will want the extra two knockout games on top of the already increased games from the expanded group stage.\n\nIf you end up in 1st or 2nd place your opponents in the knockout round will be teams theoretically easier because you'll play against the 15th or 16th team (assuming they pass the play-off)\n\nI'm not worried about it. With only 8 games to play, the point difference between teams won't be a lot. I expect the final fixture (presumably played at the same time) will be a chaos with a lot of variance depending on how other results go.\n\nEach 8 has its advantages over lower tiers. First 8 skip a round and then play a non top 8 team. Second 8 plays third 8 place teams for the first knockout. So we‚Äôre gonna see a lot of drama for those 8th, 16th and 24th places, missing those slightly will suck.\n\nDefinitely looks like an opportunity for massive rotation, otherwise clubs would be opposing the increase in games\n\nWill people want to spend money to watch Arsenal under-21s take on Rapid Vienna?\n\nSo same as last year?\n\nDoes anyone know why the writer just casually said Energy Drink Leipzig instead of RB Leipzig. It felt very dismissive out of nowhere lol. Is it just a common joke? (I know Red Bull owns them)\n\nThey're making a point combined with it being shitty journalism and an attempt at humour. I have seen people call then Soft Drink FC or stuff like that but that's usually shitposting or obviously joking on reddit or twitter or something, not when you're writing a serious new article in a supposedly reputable publication\n\nSo? What's wrong exactly?\n\nBitching about change because change. The system is not better or worse than the previous one. I see this as a fresh opportunity to see something else. Let's see if it works.\n\nIt‚Äôs worse for smaller teams, miracle runs are less likely as well. \nI do think the outrage is a bit much, I doubt most people are really that passionate about some top 15 league teams not making the cut.\nIt‚Äôs unfortunate but it was bound to happen at some point. \nAnd it‚Äôs not like the experience for the average viewer changes all that much.\n\nIt‚Äôs not worse for smaller teams. You could used to be matched in a group with the strongest teams and have to play them 6 times and just get knocked out. But now with the new table and coefficients. You play two teams from your own pot/level and then 6 other teams. And then you could finish in the top half of the table. Everyone gets an equal distribution instead of a group of death.\n\nYup, that‚Äôs what I mean, ultimately it will remain the same. Money is the issue, not the format. The odd miracle run can still happen because they are just that, miracle runs.\n\nHow is it worse for smaller teams? There are 4 extra teams having football in the Fall and 8 extra teams having football in the Spring\n\nUEFA care about one thing and one thing only‚Ä¶‚Ç¨$¬£\n\nThe new group stage is extremely more exiting as groups became predictable in recent years I also like that teams are in it for longer as most qualify for play offs and that the big teams must really try to get those top 8 spots however the problems in matchmaking and fixture conjection are my main concerns\n\nHaving dealt with it on Football Manager (which is the closest I can get to seeing how it actually plays out) the new format is....... fine, I guess.\n\nPlayers won't be happy about the extra games, and that's fair. But playing 8 different teams is more interesting than playing 3 teams twice. Big clubs will be motivated to get top 8 and avoid the round of 32.\n\nGetting through the group stage will be a piece of piss for big teams, but it always was. Smaller clubs will have a better chance of getting through the group stage but unlikely to get to play a massive club in R32.\n\nSame thing, more games. Real Madrid probably still win it.\n\nIt will be 144 different matches vs just 48 doubled.\n\nIt's really not the same tho, no club is guaranteed a spot in the champions league and clubs are chosen to be in it. All teams have to earn a spot, which was the exact opposite of the super league. Its just now a league format instead of groups but that's the only similarity\n\nThey are diluting the product. More worst games‚Ä¶ less people watching them‚Ä¶ less revenue\n\nNo it Durant, there no ManUnited.\n\nIt‚Äôs almost like the super league was announced a day before the new champions league format for a reason\n\nDUHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH\n\nIt‚Äôs literally nothing like a super league if you know anything about football. You have to qualify??\n\nMaybe it will be easier to get used to because it is an annual competition but I've not enjoyed any of the Euro's since they expanded it  in 2016.\n\nCL is supposed to be the superleague tho\n\nI‚Äôm with the author: bring back a straight up knockout competition.\n\nI think the main part is that clubs still need to qualify via domestic leagues, and not that always the same big clubs competing in the Super League without the need to qualify.\n\nSurprise Surprise.\n\nESL was impossible to get relegated from and would have destroyed domestic leagues. \n\nThis is nothing of the sort.\n\nToo many low quality games. Like the Euros it'll be shite until the later Knockouts.\n\nThe knockout in the recent euros was completely utterly shit\n\nThe clubs didn't get punished, they've got everything they wanted ever since. Look at who is and isn't getting punished for financial breaches in the premier league.....it's somehow Leicester, Everton and Forest, and somehow not Chelsea or Man City.\n\nIt looks ridiculous, boring money grabs to exploit supporters even further. Nothing wrong with the previous format, just now we have MORE football rammed down our neck by broadcasters that will expect us to pay for another 30‚Ç¨ subscription on top of what we already pay.\n\nI have tickets for Portugal vs Croatia if you are interested dm me\n\nI have tickets for Portugal vs Croatia if you are interested dm me\n\nA closed super league already exists in form of EPL, where teams are engaging in financial doping to circumvent rules and regulations, might as well have a european one as well.\n\nRip the C1, Rip European football club. Back to internationals...\n\nAs a fan of one of a team that doesn‚Äôt come from one of the ‚Äútop 5 leagues‚Äù, I was sceptical but now the draw has been made, I‚Äôm actually looking forward to this new format. \n\nWe‚Äôve got more games against opposition at ‚Äúour level‚Äù which means an increased opportunity to win games and coefficient points, rather than take four scuddings off pot 1 and 2 teams then have to scrap for the other 6 points.\n\nThe draw format was terrible to watch. Long, way too complicated and hard for the presenters to explain. The live stream chat hated it. \n\nBut worse than that, they are promising fans ‚Äúmore football‚Äù but never stop to think about the quality. In my opinion, no one wants to watch another 4 CL games if that is going to be completely one sided and boring. \n\nGreat, can‚Äôt wait to see City dominate yet another small club from Eastern Europe!!\n\nThere should be a super league. As a non-European who prefers my native code of football, European football becomes less accessible because there are too many leagues and games to keep track of. The players are international as well.\n\nThey still have to qualify for it. Real Madrid is already not taking seriously the domestic competition. My guess is that they‚Äôll either get an even increased referee help, or CL will add some kind of ‚Äúlegacy teams‚Äù rule which warranties some teams to join for free.\n\nSuperleague or not, this format is a mess that should be ditched.\n\nStill have to earn it though\n\nhow are these guys going to play all these matches?\n\nIt does and the goal of the big clubs is a Super League.\n\nNGL whether its super league teams that pushed uefa or itself, the new format is kinda interesting\n\nYeah it looks that way\n\nIt doesn't look that way at all."

Much higher demand than supply. And his last season at Bayern, he did justify his transfer fee.\n\n4..?\n\nKane, Osimhen, Martinez and Haaland.\n\nActually I don‚Äôt follow serie a too much. So, I wasn‚Äôt completely sure about Lautaro.\n\nAh I see, no worries. He‚Äôs been amazing this season even scoring in Copa America final.\n\nEven though he‚Äôs not winning trophies he can say he was valued at 100million at 30 years old\n\nEven better than a trophy!\n\nIt's because you buy him for your main rival to take them out of the running.\n\nWth I swear he's been 30 for the last 5 years\n\nKane was born looking on the young side of middle aged. ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüòπ\n\nHaha something is wrong here\n\nI mean he did move for 95m euro last summer...\n\nHis British passport accounts for about 30 million of that\n\nHe‚Äôs really good though so it does make sense¬†\n\nit always shocks me when i remember he is 30 üòÇ\n\nThat Neymar transfer in 2017 fully fked up the transfer market. Domino effect.\n\nI'd argue it was Bale to Real Madrid that started these unrealistic transfer fees.\n\nAt the time Bale looked good for the money though. Like they‚Äôd have 7-8 years of 20 goals a season\n\nBale repaid back his transfer fee in his first year in Madrid, not to mention his contribution to the threepeat\n\nIt was Neymar + renewed tv contracts for the PL. \n\nThe transfer showed clubs that if they wanted a world class player, they have to buy him very young, or he would become unpayable for normal clubs. Combine this with 20 clubs getting 50m more per year, and you suddenly get huge inflation in the top level of football (lots of big teams were renewing their 1st team as well: chelsea, RM, Barca, City, United...)\n\nHe was one of the best in the world at the time and was a small bit up on the existing record from a few years before. Neymar was basically doubled the record\n\nCURSE YOU BALE!\n\nReal with 7 of 19 is just ridiculous lol. Gonna go watch the Europa and Conference Leagues for awhile, wake me when the Champions League is competitive again\n\nSurprisingly Arsenal have the next highest at 3 if I‚Äôm counting correctly\n\nArsenal and Man City tied at 3. PSG at zero is funny given how much money they‚Äôve poured into that club\n\nThe players we‚Äôve spent large amounts of money on have left , mbappe , neymar , di Maria , icardi etc \n\nApart from kolo muani , ramos , hakimi and ugarte we don‚Äôt have any players who cost over 50 m \n\nYou don‚Äôt expect a fullback to be on this kind of list and Ramos / ugarte we‚Äôre bought as young prospects from Portugal\n\nDidn't Ramos leave?\n\nGoncalo Ramos not Sergio! Sergio Ramos went on a free transfer\n\nOh okay mb\n\nPretty sure inter have zero players bought over 50mn\n\nWhat‚Äôs your point?\n\nwhose you‚Äôre highest valued player now?\n\nTechnically xavi Simon‚Äôs but he‚Äôs never actually played for psg and will likely leave this summer \n\n[Players](https://share.icloud.com/photos/0c7dT2wwiu7Jj-iKfvbGi00PA)\n\nShouldn't Saliba be here as well?\n\nCb are valued less. But yea he would be the most valuable cb in the world I think\n\nThey are joint with City but City do have higher values players\n\nMost of these players have been revalued after playing for Real Madrid, not before:\n\nBellingham: 103 m.\nMbapp√©: 100 m.\nTchouameni: 80 m.\nVinicius 45 m.\nRodrygo 40 m.\nCamavinga: 30 m.\nValverde: 5 m.\n\nThe club have done a great job. All those players have cost around 400 million over several years. It's not as if Real Madrid has just spent money like crazy like a lot of clubs do, spending 80 million on any random player.\n\nYes that‚Äôs less than Ten Hag spent in his first 2 seasons at United\n\nYou can‚Äôt fault the management of Real. Perez is a genius.\n\nDefinitely helps when you are Real Madrid and literally every footballer in the world outside of Catalonia would die to play for you. The Bernabao, that white and gold, top European weather, all the trophies you can ask for... iconic club.\n\nAs a Liverpool fan, we were in for half those players when they were on the market and couldnt get a fucking sniff lol.\n\nWell it‚Äôs important to note that they invested much less than they are worth now‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs the most impressive thing, the deals they manage to do because it‚Äôs a club many players wants to be.\n\nit kinda helps that players playing for Real automatically goes up like 20m of value\n\nYamal value is wild for such a young player, can only imagine it goes up\n\nYou may not realize that the value is based on his expected development. If you pay 120 now it is not because he is worth it but because you think he will be worth it soon enough.\n\nSo young players have very high values due to expected growth. Mbappe as an example is more stable. A bit older so you know what you get.\n\nYeah but that growth will continue for a while before he starts losing his athletic ability\n\nIt's not about whether the growth continues. It's expected to continue. It's about whether he surpasses his growth expectation or not. If he doesn't, his value will fall. Just like the stock market.\n\nYamal just turned 17 a week ago, and he‚Äôs already valued at ‚Ç¨120 million. I can‚Äôt imagine how much he will be worth when he‚Äôs 20 if he keeps improving, growing, and winning more trophies for his club and country.\n\nDon‚Äôt worry. Barca will burn him to the ground and he‚Äôll be pedri 2.0\n\nPretty sure it was the Spain national team who burned Pedri\n\nHe overplayed for both\n\nHe didn‚Äôt really overplay for Barcelona. He CHOSE to play both the Euro and the Olympics with the NT. So, I don‚Äôt really know where comments like ‚ÄòBarcelona will burn them to the ground‚Äô are even coming from.\n\nPSG offers 250.000.000‚Ç¨ for Yamine Lamal. Let's hope he doesn't fall in the same trap Neymar did. Some reporters did some research and he's 17 and 1 week so his life is worth almost 30‚Ç¨ for every minute he lived. ü§£\n\nJust because a player chooses something doesn't mean they're not overplayed. Sometimes managing someone is telling them no.\n\nBarca fans aren‚Äôt ready to hear this\n\nTbh, sometimes people on Reddit need to educate themselves more before commenting.\n\nPedri is still good but nowhere near the level he was supposed to be. As a Madridista he's one of the few Bar√ßa players I like/d... liked him since the beginning. Fati also. And of course Lamine aswell. There are these players you can't just hate for no valid reason.\n\nOnly time he was rested was during a 2 goal lead over PSG, Xavi masterclass.\n\ndon‚Äôt get all of this hate with the pedri situation, yes pedri was overplayed as hell but yamal was originally managed well until injuries started spiking again\n\nTechnically he most likely will be worth less unless he pumps out Mbappe numbers. Age is the no 1 factor in Transfermarkt valuations\n\nso many overrated players\n\njust as many as there are english players.\n\nFoden\n\nKhvicha deserves to be hereüòû\n\nWho would have thought Bayer Leverkusen shows up on such a list, just a few years ago.\n\nI wouldn't pay 120 million grains of rice for rice.\n\nHe's the odd one out for me, unlike the rest he has no wow factor.\n\nI like Rice but I'm a bit baffled about just how highly people rate him. You'd swear he was the best midfielder England have ever had.\n\nI don‚Äôt watch Arsenal but watching him play for England he looked like a headless chicken who panicked every time he got the ball and made many poor passes. He just seems to lose composure in possession. He‚Äôs no Pirlo that‚Äôs for sure!\n\nFor Arsenal he really pulls the team together. In a way he‚Äôs like our Rodri\n\nSame, it's not hard to spot his weaknesses just watching him.\n\nHe seems the most obvious example of \"English tax\". I feel like players with his ability are really common in Spain, France, Germany and Italy, but because he's a little less common in England he is outrageously overrated.\n\nI mean even in England the a lot of players who could do what he can do they are just less talked about. I mean the wasn‚Äôt much of difference between him and Jordan Henderson only that Henderson could pass the ball forward.\n\nI think henderson was even more limited to be honest. He did a bit more mean-mugging to look hard.\n\nIsak at Newcastle should be on here. He is electric and still young!\n\nCannot believe there‚Äôs no Fellaini on this list.\n\nFoden?\n\nAre we just forgetting the season he just had? One tournament aint gonna change shit.\n\nYep. Idiots here\n\nAfter that euro performance idk how he's even here\n\nBecause when a guy shines in a tournament like that everyone think he's the new man to have in your squad, if a guy completely misses people tend to be more \"reasonable\" and think it's just one bad stretch of games I would guess\n\nClassic Reddit comment. Player who absolutely shines all season in the hardest league in the world, clutching his 4th PL in a row for his club. But because he had a handful of bad games in an international tournament (despite almost every English player underperforming) you think he should lose all his valuation. Hilarious stuff mate.\n\nSo many people don‚Äôt understand a player can be a star in a certain role and absolutely fail in another. I don‚Äôt watch much of Man City, but it‚Äôs obvious Foden was playing in a much different role in the England team that didn‚Äôt utilize his strengths like for his club.\n\nSame with Mbappe\n\nWhat?\n\nYou think he had a good Euro performance?\n\nWhat about Bellingham then? If they measure performance of the EC Jude would be in buy range of my local amateur team\n\nNo Manchester United, Liverpool or Chelsea!!\nIf this was 2008 teams, we‚Äôd have Ronaldo, Rooney , Ferdinand, Lampard, Essien, Ballack, Drogba, Gerrard, Alonso and Torres\n\nRonaldo would be double anyone else bar rooney, messi and ronaldinho. A year later and Messi shoots ahead\n\nYeah! Ronaldo exiting Man Utd would be $250m\n\nI played a lot of FIFA Manager (not football manager as a kid). Remember Ronaldinho being well above 30m pounds and Gerrard around 30 in 06 with Ronaldo valued at 17m\n\nAt that time we had Adriano as a great player valued at 19m!\n\nNo Cole Palmer? ü§î\n\nHow is Palmer not on there? Dude has just come off an insane season where he has more goals and assists than almost everyone on this list, is still young and has shit loads of time left on his contract.\n\n[deleted]\n\n9 of them were penalities, and he didnt miss a single one of them, thats kinda good though\n\nYou think it's easy to score a penalty¬†\n\nIt's one of the easiest chances a player can get. Penalties have a 70%+ success rate for strikers. Typical conversion rate are in the teens. So yes they're easy.\n\n[deleted]\n\n27 goals and 15 assists across all competitions. 9 pens, 100% conversion rate. So that's 33 (non pen) goal involvements in his first season at a new club. \n\nThen scored a banger in the Euro final to complete the season.\n\n\"Overrated\" lmao\n\nTransfermarkt is Real madrid biased, always overrating their players.\n\nYou cant be serious, You do realize that except for Tchouameni and Jude those real madrid players have been key for 2 champions league and 2 ligas already with Valverde being the oldest at 26 so that market price is going through the roof.\n\nWas Afraid Anthony was on here‚Ä¶\n\ncrazy how rice can play like ass and still be even worth anywhere near 80 million nevermind 120\n\nMartinez, after his copa America games, should be at least at 150 (Last change of his value was 5 June - before copa America).\n\nSaliba should be in. If anything was good for France it was that Saliba clearly is a top 3 defender, if not already the very best. If Van Dijk was worth 82m, Saliba should be 120 at least\n\nYou mean adjusting for inflation? Because Saliba, good as he is, really isn‚Äôt at peak van Dijk level just yet. Certainly not 40m better.\n\nJust because Saliba is seen as better than Van Dijk now doesn‚Äôt make him on peak Van Dijk level.\n\nNo Rafael Leao??\n\nPretty depressing to see as a Dortmund fan that two players who left us within the last two years are almost as valueable as our entire squad now\n\nBellingham and?\n\nInsane that Madrid has Bellingham, Vini AND Mbappe now.\n\nWhere my boy Antony at?\n\nWhere is arda guler\n\nHe‚Äôs worth 2 billion\n\n45 million\n\nCold world, cole palmer makes this list within the next few years ü•∂ü•∂ü•∂ü•∂\n\nRice 120m lmao ü§£\n\nSaka clear of foden by miles\n\ncall me crazy but the least deserving players on this list is Kane\n\nHow about Saka, since we're obviously talking based on Euro performances?\n\nSaka the best England forward this euros?\n\n*Foden\n\nno I'm not, I simply don't see Kane being worth 100 million although there is no official transfer value for any player and transfermarkt is simply an estimate\n\n  \nand Saka deserves to be 100 million pounds. He showed at the Euros that he was England's best forward in a dysfunctional side, making the most of the limited opportunities given to him by the system. He was one of a couple of players along with Pickford, Rice, Mainoo, Guehi, Palmer and Shaw who can hold their head up high\n\nWell you clearly missed the fact that Kane scored 44 goals along with 12 assists in 45 matches for Bayern this past season. If this is not worthy of such a price tag, I don't know what is.\n\nI've said it before, player valuations by transfermarkt hold no real value. Just a nice thing to look at while playing higher or lower. If he's worth 100 million then you then that's fine.\n\nKane sold for ‚Ç¨100m euros last year quite literally worth ‚Ç¨100m that‚Äôs without mentioning how he more than exceeded his expectations at bayern.\n\nWho decided to add Kane cause I wanna have a chat üòÇüòÇüòÇ\n\nTop scorer in the Bundesliga, and marketable. I don‚Äôt think Bayern would accept much less than 100 million euros if someone put a bid in.\n\nI don't think anyone would bid over 60 mil after his performance in the euros. He became an English Lukaku üíÄ\n\nHe wasn‚Äôt fit and played really badly, but a lot of players played badly in the Euros. Big name strikers are in short supply, so they‚Äôre expensive. He‚Äôs English, so that brings the price up too.¬†\n\nYeah he performed poor but most strikers at that euros were poor.\n\nHalf the Real Madrid starting IX haha üëë\n\nlol Bellingham is so fucking overrated\n\nThe race for 200m continues\n\nIf Spain wins the world cup yamal is gonna hit it\n\nhe is not a 200m player\n\nThey should have credit default swaps for players.\nAnd there should be a clause that stipulates ‚Äúshould a treble not be achieved in the first season, the agent must forfeit their commission‚Äù.\n\nI don't have any knowledge of the minute details of the operations of the clubs, but they easily could make credit default swaps or other transactions to mitigate and allocate risk.  I would be surprised if they are not doing such deals in one form or another already.\n\nAs for your second point, the correct party already suffers when a player turns out to be a dud - the team who spent a ridiculous amount of money on an inherently risky investment.  Taking away the agent's commission wouldn't serve any rational purpose in my opinion - the agent would still have every incentive in the world to push for the biggest payment possible.  \n\nI know this is 3 days old, so this may just fall into the abyss of the electronic network, but I think your points are interesting.\n\nNo sir, you‚Äôre pretty much right about the agent part. Maybe I should have been more articulate and mentioned a price ceiling above which would trigger said clause. Mr Raiola (RIP) would have been quite upset had he forfeited his commission for Pogba. \nUltimately, agents are all scum from housing to automotive to people.\n\nWhere is Vitinha?\n\nNo Chelsea players?\n\nEqui Fern√°ndez where\n\ncries in united üò≠\n\nValverde !?!?\n\n3 madrid players at 180 is bonkers\n\nThe entire Real Madrid club. Mbappe should be more. He is better than vini, no?\n\nseeing them both, vini might have surpassed him this year\n\nI wonder if a salary cap would make it more fun to watch on football scene similar to NFL where we got different championship contender each year. I mean obviously Real Madrid is winning everything, they got a lot of money to recruit the best footballers out there(accompanied with the best management team of course).\n\ntbf, that would not change too much because Madrid does not overpay. top 2 earners in la liga are barca players\n\ndamn. we dont have a single player up there.\n\nSurely Cole Palmer should be in here?\n\nI thought Olmo would somehow make it into the list you know. Especially with what he did this year\n\nCole palmer still not 100m is crazy. For me he was the best English player at the euros\n\nIf you remove the first 1 from every player in this list. It makes sense.\n\nThis valuation stuff is crap. The amounts being quoted or estimated can only be afforded by very few clubs at great financial risk to the club itself, not the individuals who finance the deals.\n\nFoden and Saka are good but not even close to 140/150m good. Then you need to be at the level of Prime Salah and show it trough multiple seasons.\n\nThey are not close to that level and they never will become that good\n\nonly the top 4 are real\n\nHow is this fair? Madrid has so many of them\n\nWonder why Cole Palmer doesn't make that list\n\nBluelock reference\n\nPrices like this and then people wonder why clubs are struggling with finances and shit with the amount of wages they pay out and cost to build teams.\n\nInteresting that there's not a single defender there\n\nthey are never valued that high unless Saliba would make this list.\n\nHow is Rice worth more than Odegaard\n\nI think odegaard is a better player than rice too but there are more odegaard type players than there are rice type players\n\nAnd its all 80 million too much. Way too much money flies around because of some people putting on a different jersey. Its crazy and its gotten a bit out of hand.\n\nDont get me wrong, millions for a transfer is fine, but this is just excessive. There is more inflation here than in the housing market.\n\nKane ??? ü§£\n\nNo Conor Chaplin? That list is such BS.\n\nTransfermrkt just makes shit up\n\nfootball is facing a crazy decline!\n\nSigma\n\nWhere's Goatany of Manchester United\n\nSaka worth more than Lamal and Musiala? Lmao\n\nPedri, Gavi, Kvaratskhelia?\n\nI think Valverde is a bit overrated. Just me?\n\nOver rated, all of them ü´óü´óü´ó\n\nFoden being there is just ridiculous\n\nHaaland y Vinicius estan m√°s arriba de lo que deber√≠an\n\nWithout DeBruyne this list is crap.\n\nis it not ronaldo?\n\nLamal and musiala need a downgrade in worth\n\nDoesn't Haaland have a surprisingly simple weakness given his valuation?\n\n\nCut off passes to him and he can't do anything anymore. Unlike the rest 3 players he's tied with. Wonder why he is valued so high\n\nEdit: I feel like this has set the wrong tone. Haaland is great without a doubt. But doesn't he disappear in big games? He was nowhere to be seen in UCL quarter finals. Meanwhile Yamal coming off changed Barcelona's whole attack prowess.\n\nBrilliant. If you cut passes to Mbappe he also won‚Äôt do anything lol\n\nManagers hate this one simple trick.\n\nI wonder what else a striker is supposed to do. Put some respect he has over 20 senior hatricks at just 24 years of age.\n\n&gt;Cut off passes to him and he can't do anything anymore. Unlike the rest 3 players he's tied with. Wonder why he is valued so high\n\nThis sounds daft, you could've said have him play with his back to goal. Not being able to receive the ball is a weakness for any player.\n\nWell just don‚Äôt buy him if you can‚Äôt pass him the ball?\n\nBcoz he does his job perfectly well. That's why Pep is happy."

    "all_comment_text": "wait‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre telling me people have been acting this way in the stadium sober ?\n\nPeople are still getting hammered in the pub before the games and in the concourse. You're just not allowed to bring alcoholic drinks into the stands\n\nI mean at least that means you‚Äôve got a couple of hours where they can‚Äôt drink too intensely before spilling out onto the streets pissed off about a match not going their way.\n\nEven if they drink at halftime, you probably have a solid chance they‚Äôll leave more sober than they arrived.\n\nYou‚Äôd be suprised how much that half time pint downed in 4 minutes inbetween getting served and the second half starting can be the tipping point. I‚Äôm always noticeably drunker leaving the games where i get a quick half time pint in.\n\nI never bother at half time, by the time I‚Äôve queued up and been served I have to neck a fizzy pint in 30 seconds to make 2nd half kick off.\n\nJust enough time to drink it then.\n\nSometimes the way the game is going you need it\n\nYour team is down two nil and they score within the first minute putting them back in the game, just for a pint?\n\nEh, they‚Äôll probably lose anyway. One more round please!\n\nYou‚Äôve never sampled the half time water, sorry ‚Äúbeer‚Äù, at the emirates, then?\n\nOnly been to the emirates to watch england when i was 12‚Ä¶. So yes.\n\nI‚Äôm not familiar with English stadiums, but to get a drink at half time do you have to leave the stadium and find a pub nearby? Or is there a place serving alcohol in the stadium - but you just can‚Äôt take a drink from there back to your seat?\n\nAnswer B! you can buy food &amp; beer but you can't have it in your seat.\n\nIt's just alcohol that isn't allowed in view of the field.\n\nBecause then the players would want some too. Makes sense.\n\nNah, you have to go out to the concourse and drink it there.   Can't bring it back to the seats.\n\ndoesn't their beer cap out at like 4% or something?\n\nI drink two bottles of red wine in a pint at half time\n\nI think I had 4 pints at Goodison v Wolves last year during halftime. It‚Äôs incredibly easy to down a few and get back to your seat\n\nNot really. The current scenario is that people get tanked up to balance out those few hours. Even worse in Scotland where there's no booze in the stadiums and people are downing cans in the street as quickly as possible to avoid having it poured away.\n\nDoubt it will change, smash 4 tinnies before the game or pay ¬£9 for a dark fruits in a stadium üòÖ\n\nThey used those 2 hours to snort coke.\n\nOr if they could drink while watching the match they wouldn't cram in beers before kick off and at half time.\n\nMaybe but I‚Äôm not sure that would be what would actually happen. \n\nIf you‚Äôre so intent on going to a game pissed up that you‚Äôre front loading in a pub from 11am onwards, you‚Äôre probably not going to suddenly have a healthier relationship with alcohol if you can drink in the 2 hours the game actually takes place in.\n\nIf you are drinking from 11 am a couple of 45 minute gaps won't make much difference. \n\nPersonally I can't last 45 mins after 2 pints without having a pee and I think people getting up out of their seats constantly would cause more agro that a drunk person.\n\nAcc the opposite a lot. People go harder before the game because they can‚Äôt drink inside so they drink too much too quick and end up shitfaced.\n\nPeople just pre drink harder before because they know they can't get it in the stadium\n\nThe prices at Spurs for drinks, they can't drink intensley there either without sticking it all on Klarna\n\nAs an away fan, I commend Spurs for their catering though. There is a superb selection, and several decent veggie options too. And their hot drinks (I'm a Bovril quaffer) are slightly cheaper than home (Bournemouth)\n\nDo you find that Bovril at football stadiums is totally different to what you make at home? It's better at the stadium. Something to do with powder/granules rather than paste from a jar. Jar version tastes closer to marmite.\n\n45 minutes won't sober you up AT ALL lol\n\nHah. You underestimate my power to slam 5 pints in the 15 min half time. \n  \nIt makes it worse lol.\n\nOk money bags with all your \"money for 5 pints\"\n\nHaha fuckin hell don't need to be reminded how expensive it is these days\n\nBeers were cheap as fuck as an American.\n\nNaw because it makes you pregame that much harder\n\nIt‚Äôs actually probably worse though. In the current situation, you would have a lot of people going ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt drink at the game‚Äù and so they do one of (some probably do both) start earlier or drink faster and harder before the game. You‚Äôve then probably got a few that go harder at halftime than they would if they could just casually have a beer with the game\n\nYea, a guy I went with once, he got 4 pints each for the 4 of us, I got through 2, doesn't help it was terrible tasting anyway ha\n\nI think they have tables at halftime with prefilled beers for chugging. Then it‚Äôs 45-55 mins of game\n\nIn my view having limits like this encourages binge drinking. \n\nPubs serving until 11pm created generations of people who would accelerate their drinking until the bar closes. The bell goes at 10:50pm and everyone is up at the bar to get one more in.\n\nBanning drinks in stadiums meant that people will drink until 2:55pm in the pub across the road and run into the stadium just in time for a 3pm kick off. If there wasn't that time pressure they could potentially drink *less overall* as they wouldn't feel rushed.\n\nHowever, binge drinking is a habit in itself that will take time to unlearn.\n\nYeah that's how I see it. I know people are gonna fill up before kick off but the biggest liabilities are still gonna drink too much before kick off and continue drinking throughout the game. They talk about being more family friendly. How about less drunks instead of more\n\nPlus, my fellow Americans forget that football hasn‚Äôt let commercialization take over the league to the point of dragging games. \n\nIt‚Äôs roughly 105 minutes from kickoff to game over. \n\nYou can watch two full length 90 minute football matches, with half time, back to back, in the same time it takes to watch a single 60 minute NFL match. \n\nI like American football. But it‚Äôs really ~3.5 hours of commitment for literally about 8 minutes of ball in play. There‚Äôs also ‚Äúanticipation‚Äù concepts which are cool, but the 3.5 hours are monopolized by commercials. \n\nTLDR some people might be framing the ‚Äúno drinking in stadiums‚Äù with the background concept of how long that would last.\n\nWow could not imagine watching a professional game and not enjoying a beer. That‚Äôs crazy.\n\nDon‚Äôt forget in the bathroom at home with the wife crying outside.\n\nSo people just go buy a drink and slam it then go back to the stands. That seems like it just encourages people to get really drunk\n\nIn England, you can buy alcohol in the stadium but not in view of the pitch! So, you are stuck with your drink in the concourse (or in boxes with closed blinds if you are that lucky...)\n\nBeen a box. Drank beer on the balcony while watching the match. Didn't have to close the blinds.\n\nRules are different for the rich\n\nLucky me then but I'm not rich. Just got a lucky day out.\n\nYou're saying this as a bad thing\n\nYou can drink in the ground but just not in sight of the pitch. It‚Äôs absolutely archaic.\n\nBlame Thatcher.\n\nBlame the people who can‚Äôt handle their booze\n\nWhat has banning drinking in view of the pitch got to do with that when you can still drink literally everywhere else, including before and after the game, and during the game if you go into the concourse?\n\nOh I do, for everything.\n\nBecause drunk people would throw their glass bottle / cup at the players\n\nThey already do that anyway.\n\nVery little actually, compared to some major leagues.\n\nSo why do you think there will be a sudden spate?\n\nMandatory keg stands?\n\nEnglish fans are infamous for copious cocaine usage\n\nNo it‚Äôs actually funnier. You can‚Äôt drink during the game but they sell beer at the stadiums. Basically you just get shitfaced enough to still be shit faced by the end of the match. This means chugging like 4-5 beers in like 20 mins pre kickoff.\n\nHow easy is it to get a flask into the stands and sip without being spotted?\n\nDepends on how much lube you have\n\nProbably varies by ground, but at arsenal it would be incredibly easy and I see people around me with flasks pretty often for late games in the lower stands. The security consists of a half hearted pat down, and they usually don't even bother for women cause they don't have enough female stewards.\n\nSober?? People get hammered before the match, chug at half time, and do bumps in the stands. I swear, every PL match I've had on television this season, they've caught someone schneefin' and have to cut away super fast.\n\nCocaine is a huge problem within football fans. It would be interesting to see if alcohol in the stands would therefore decrease cocaine usage? Probably not, but a man can dream\n\nU can buy drinks at the stadium but can‚Äôt take it to the stands. lol I remember I had to chug my IPA before the match started once so I wouldn‚Äôt miss it\n\nNah you get shit faced in the bar before and at half time.\n\nWe can drink at half time, just not allowed in the stands¬†\n\nCocaine and prelash. \n\nNot sure what makes them think adding more alcohol will do any favours.\n\nNo people just get drunk before the game at the pub or during the game in the concourse.\n\nCocaine's a hell of a drug\n\nThe ban is within view of the pitch. There are still loads of bars in the stands themselves, but you can‚Äôt take your drink to your seat.\n\nYep. Part of the effect of the ban is for people to get tanked up beforehand because they know they can‚Äôt drink while watching the game.\n\nIt‚Äôs the cocaine. \n\nOh and all the pre match beers too.\n\nNo mate, get the beers in beforehand and the nose beers in the stadium\n\nYes because cocaine.\n\nActing what way? Quietly sitting down and occasionally applauding? Have you been to a PL game recently?\n\nMy wife and I went to a West Ham game a few years ago. \n\nI was shocked at first that we couldn't drink in the stands. \n\nAfter about 30 seconds to gather our thoughts we bought two Cokes and two beers and from then on had no problems drinking in our seats.\n\nIgnoring the obvious concerns, here‚Äôs a trivial, yet really annoying one. Remember when you‚Äôre watching a game outside, there‚Äôs a goal and some moron decides to throw their drink in the air? Now there‚Äôs a new place you‚Äôll be coated in a fine mist of beer.\n\nSome moron? More like nearly everyone. Never got it myself, what a waste of expensive beer\n\nTo be fair though, I'm English and when Watkins' scored against Netherlands, I'd have done it even with a full pint of Peroni.\n\nWhy?\n\nReckless abandon because something so joyous makes you not care about anything else. The atmosphere of everyone else experiencing the same jubaltion at the same time as you and everyone just being caught up in the moment with no inabitions or care for consequences.\n\nThis is the case sometimes, but these days people just do deliberately to be arseholes. \n\nLook at the clips of England fans at Boxpark during the Euros. People are watching penalties ready to launch their pints once it's scored, not spontaneous joy at all.\n\nYeah, and I think if you‚Äôre outside in the summer watching a final or something that‚Äôs fine. However, I once got in a fight with a table of lads while watching a meaningless friendly in a pub, after they threw their pints up in the air and drenched my missus. Fucking glass pints too, knobheads.\n\nPeople that have watched football on telly their whole life wont understand that.\n\nPeople that watch it on tele are predominantly the ones doing that. They just happen to be big teles at a park etc. \n\nLive in the stadium I‚Äôve found myself running and hugging absolute strangers in the jubilation moments. There‚Äôs no need to go round chucking beers everywhere. You see it in the videos all the time, plenty of people aren‚Äôt acting ‚Äúin the moment‚Äù, they look around for a few seconds and then decide why not, and just choose to launch their drink like a bellend.\n\nIve never seen someone see a goal go in, place their drink down, and then celebrate. If a pint is in your hand you‚Äôll probably end up wearing it.\n\nAt what point in the jubilation does the physical cup/bottle disappear out of your hand. Do 100s of people suddenly forget how to hold a cup? I get spilling some of it, predominantly on yourself in celebration, but people literally go out of their way to throw their drinks for no other reason than ‚Äúlimbs‚Äù. Someone 6-8ft away shouldn‚Äôt be getting smashed in the head with a full cup of beer because some dickhead *chose* to throw it.\n\nTheres dickheads everywhere. But majority of people throwing beer in celebration are only doing it because it is in their hand. Imagine 40,000 people doing that in a stadium. The middle classes and family fans would have more to moan about than bad language\n\nSpilling your pint celebrating vs deliberately throwing it would be the important distinction to make.\n\nActually the most well written and explained way to put this I have ever seen, hate it when people question pints going in the air, this exactly what you have written is why.\n\nBecause it's the best way to get rid of Peroni\n\nPure passion and bliss. It‚Äôs actually quite fun to get overly excited.\n\nI‚Äôm not a beer thrower personally, but I get it. And for the sake of a goal in an international tournament, I‚Äôll get over being a tad wet.\n\nI'm worried about having to move all the time for people going to the toilet/bar while the game is going.\n\nIt will only be the same as a concert or a gig\n\nIn reality there are only 45 mins before a break and very few people are going to miss 10+ minutes of it to get a beer. They‚Äôll buy them before the kickoff and bring it with them.\n\nDude I‚Äôve heard stories of people pissing in their plastics cups and throwing them\n\nPiss cups are real\n\nThat happens at football TV parks and festivals alike.\n\nIf you haven't been covered in piss, you have been close enough to the stage\n\nNot seen it mentioned yet, but there‚Äôs also the added triviality of having to constantly stand up and let people back and forth to get more beers during the game.\n\nMassive problem in international rugby these days with people constantly up and down getting pints\n\nIt's been described as a massive beer garden with a game going on and players have come out and complained because on the pitch they just hear the chatter of conversations like in a pub instead of cheers\n\nIt ruins the experience for me....unless I also get up and down drinking pints all game\n\nYou don't say cheers when someone gets a round in the pub? Terrible\n\nlol yeah, kinda ironically I came to UK and was initially critical of how you couldn‚Äôt bring a beer to your seat‚Ä¶ but after a few games I‚Äôm full 180 and would actually advocate keeping the beers out of the seats, because it can be a significant disruption to the viewing. Added bonus of actually remembering the games and experience more.\n\nWitnessed similar with cricket, although in fairness you‚Äôre camped there for hours\n\nIt‚Äôs why some pubs and venues don‚Äôt mind it because it means they‚Äôre selling a lot more and the floors are trashed usually anyway so deep clean after regardless.\n\nPart of the game\n\nFor some reason, an entire section of supporters do just that at a DC United game whenever they score.  Never understood throwing a $10+ beer on folks below you.\n\nGermany for the euroes, lads behind me chucked 2 full pints, completely soaking rest of night, nice one\n\nUnless I read it wrong the trial is for women‚Äôs football\n\nMakes a lot more sense.¬†\n\nThe group I go to games with on weekends all meet 2-3 hours before kick off. We have some leisurely drinks for the first hour or so which changes to faster drinking closer to kick off.¬†\n\nIf we have time we have a quick one on the concourse before heading into the stands.¬†\n\nWe then start to time when we should head down for a half time pint to try and beat the crowds. Bars are ridiculously packed then and since they stopped pre pouring pints and halves the queues have got worse. Pre orders don‚Äôt work either.¬†\n\nThis is the same group that goes to the rugby. We don‚Äôt have the same time pressure on us so we can keep to the leisurely drinking pace all day without time pressures and we take it in turns to grab more drinks during the game and bring it back to the stands.¬†\n\nYep, people are going to drink, it's part of the culture, and all the ridiculous law does is force people to to drink at certain times and with a time limit. This definitely encourages more dangerous drinking patterns and huge queues. And all because Thatcher hated football fans 40 years ago.\n\nIt's not all about groups of lads getting hammered. Some of us would just quite like the option of a pint without having to knock it in record time because you finally get served 3 seconds before second half kicks off or (my personal favourite) being told to move off the sacred yellow lines by some jobsworth steward because you've marginally encroached to let someone past.¬†\n\nThere was a *lot* of hooliganism back then - Heysel happened in 1985 and we were banned from European club competitions for five years.\n\nBritish Rail used to put on special football trains for away fans, known as \"Footexs\" in the industry. They typically used older carriages because they were a) spare and b) they knew there was a decent chance of them getting trashed by drunken fans. You even had more than one hooligan group specifically referencing the railways in their names. The British Transport Police would end up assigning officers to escort the fans and keep an eye on things.\n\nYou still get them on occasion, but they're much rarer. They tend to be provided by the special charter companies as the main train companies don't have the spare stock. Usually more of a private arrangement; coaches are the preferred method as they're easier to organise.\n\nOther countries have them too.\n\nThat‚Äôs why the atmosphere at rugby isn‚Äôt as good though, people are constantly milling about going to get drinks and it becomes a big social gathering with the sport taking a back seat. Which is fine if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre after but I think it will have a much bigger effect than people think on stadium atmosphere in football.\n\nWait so you miss the end of the first half because you want to beat the halftime crowds to the beer queue? What if you miss goals?!\n\nIs it not a common thing in England for people to sneak alcohol into the venue? Do you guys have nips or airplane bottles or little bottles (whatever the fuck you want to call them) over there? Walking into a sporting event with some fireball nips up your sleeve is a regular occurrence and almost an expectation in the US.\n\nTickets cost so much now fans can't afford a ¬£15 beer as well...\n\nSlightly different to 1985...\n\nI‚Äôve found pints in footy grounds cheaper than outside.. this is in the EFL though so might be why\n\nI pay ¬£3.60 for a large bottle of carlsberg in anfield, definitely cheaper than expected\n\nDecent, that‚Äôs way better than I was expecting\n\n¬£15 beer? Where have you seen that? Arsenal is notoriously expensive yet is half that price for a pint \n\nOnly time I've seen a beer near that price has been in American stadiums\n\nGame's back\n\nThey banned glass beer drinks on my country cause people used to get drunk and throw them to the rest of the people lmfao\n\nBit of a double edged sword for me.\n\nOn one hand as someone who likes 2 or 3 pints at games it sounds good - instead of rushing a pint at halftime I can take it to my seat.\n\nDoesn't make a ton of sense, most people who came to watch the game won't want to get up to grab a pint while the games still on. Also you'll have every bird who's come with their fella getting up and down all game to get drinks, that seems annoying.\n\nCan see it being horrendous if a goal goes in just after half time and people are throwing limbs with full pints in their hand.\n\nI agree. People talking about other sports having drinks in the stands but football unlike those is non stop. Why the fuck would I get up, queue for 10 minutes for a pint, and bring it all the way back to my seat. Probably just missed 15minutes of the game ffs\n\nHave you never been to a football game outside of england? Its completely normal for the rest of us. I personally love seeing people go ballistic when goals are scored, even if it means beers are being thrown.¬†\n\n[deleted]\n\ndefinitely is already\n\nIt already is, isn't it? I was under the impression that it was just competitions overseen by the FA that didn't allow it. I've always been had beers on the terraces on non-league stadiums, unless it's been an FA Cup match.\n\n6th tier (NL N/S) it is already allowed\n\nSource: Drank beer in the stands at a 6th tier football match\n\nMy bad, didn't think that was the case. Seems to start at 6th tier and below\n\nPersonally I‚Äôd prefer they didn‚Äôt‚Ä¶ but it will be interesting to see the results.\n\nIt sadly only takes a few morons to ruin it for everyone\n\nWas at the American Football in Wembley last Sunday and was surprised to see everyone drinking beers in the seats. (Didn't notice any negative impacts)\n\nDifferent sport and culture. Rugby League is a working class sport like football used to be and has few issues with drinking. I go to a fair amount of non-league and see few issues. I think coke has been a bigger problem for the last few years though within football stadiums.\n\nI can't think of any way that could go wrong.¬†\n\nYou can drink in the stadium just not in the stands. Get drunk in concourse or pregame. I doubt it changes much\n\nit means you can't throw pints over everyone like a bellend.\n\nIt also means that people aren‚Äôt generally running back and forth to the bar, spilling pints everywhere and throwing them in the air when there‚Äôs a goal. I‚Äôm very happy for the ban to stay in place tbh.\n\nThats true\n\nIf Germany can manage it why can't England\n\nJust because something isn't flawless doesn't mean it shouldn't be allowed. People have car crashes, we shouldn't ban driving either. \n\nAnd people drink before and at the game, stopping them taking it to their seat isn't making any meaningful difference to anyone.\n\nMost of us grown adults can handle a couple of beers at a football game without being a hooligan, I just hope the small minority of idiots don‚Äôt ruin it for the rest of us!\n\nHooligan, \"Hold my beer!\"\n\nI actually much prefer this change.\n\nBetter for me to be sipping a pint throughout the game rather than down one quickly before getting into my seat.\n\nObviously I'd be interested in the trials and results but I'd welcome it. Just don't fancy people chucking beer around in celebration as that is always nasty\n\nWhat are the attendances like at Women's Championship games? Is this trial going to give any new insight that we can't already get from the fact you can drink at games from the National League North/South downwards?\n\nPlease no. If people wanna drink that's their choice and they can crack on, but I'd rather me and my kid don't get showered with beer every time a team scores.\n\nI have 100% seen my dad drinking a pint he bought at the match in the stands over the years. If that ban has been in effect the enforcement has been awful.\n\nVery easy to slip a pint into a big coat pocket to get past the stewards. Then once you're back in your seat you're fine!\n\nLive in Australia, but went to a couple EPL games in Feb. Could not bloody believe it when I couldnt have a beer in my seat. It‚Äôs just so common here and is policed quite well at AFL games.\n\nYou know what really boils my piss. In Scotland you can only drink alcohol in the hospitality lounges.\n\nLiverpool fans, who caused the Heysel disaster, can have a bevy but across the border, Queen of the South fans are not allowed to have a pint before the game or at half-time.\n\nWe're not an independent country but we do have a pitiful devolved government to tell people where and when they can have a beer.\n\nDo people throw beer into the air often in countries where there isn't a ban?\n\nIt is bonkers that you could drink a pint in a certain seat watching Wigan Warriors at the DW Stadium but you‚Äôre not allowed to drink a pint in the same seat in the same ground watching Wigan Athletic\n\nIt's so much better with a beer, or two!\n\nAbout fucking time.¬†\n\n\nThe current situation is just a worst of all worlds, leading to a crush in the concourse at half time as already inebriated people try to neck a pint or two quickly then stagger back up to the stands as it goes straight to their heads, whilst ordinary people who maybe just want a beer with the game are penalised.¬†\n\n\nHere's a radical solution, how's about we actually enforce the rules on people turning up pissed put of their minds rather than preemptive blanket bans?¬†\n\nCan I suggest Cardiff v Swansea?\n\nDamn whats the worst that could happen?\n\nI remember watching Nantes play at their stadium whilst drinking beer and chain smoking, it was so good\n\nEngland is so far behind America. Doesn‚Äôt even have ¬£20 pound beers\n\none sink tease cooing alleged quiet office arrest fine murky\n\n *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev/home)*\n\nSpurs have been trailing this for a couple of seasons ever since the brought in those 1 pint, opaque water bottles with the nice round rim to avoid spillages\n\nThe funny thing is, you can go to a non league game and get smashed off your pickle. I follow a team in the Isthmian League and you can buy alcohol throughout the course of the game and have it pitch side. We get respectable crowds at this level (between 1-2k a game) and people are routinely smashed for em.\n\nLike others have said, you just drink pre game and at half time. That half time pint downed in about five minutes really does have an effect!\n\nI cant wait the half full pints of piss come flying down the stands.\n\nGreat work by the new independent regulator, this is exactly what the premier league has been missing.\n\nWent to NFL game where it was allowed.¬† On the first touchdown huge guy literally showered a kid with beer who was in the seat ahead. All because it was in his hand and he was jumping up and down cheering. Absolutely vile situation. So this is a hard no.¬†\n\nThis will be fine until a group of away fans get pissed off with a ref and start launching their drinks onto the pitch and a game gets called off because there's plastic shit everywhere - then the ban will come back.\n\nThink the trial is for women's football anyway, which will probably work as it usually a much more family friendly atmosphere.\n\nwait what? Brits can't drink at football matches? Really?????? I refuse to believe this. As in, they don't sell beer in the stadium?\n\nGreat news for United fans ü´†\n\nWell some moronic Gen Z Civil Servant had to come up with another stupid idea after freezing pensioners over the winter.\n\nRecipe for disaster.\n\nIn Brasil my state banned beer in 2008. I get hungover at halftime...\n\njust don‚Äôt throw your cup in the air!\n\nStupid twats think the extra revenue will be worth the extra disorder.\n\nThis is outrageous. When does this \"trial\" period become a success? Its bullshit.Why would they do this other than to let alcohol seller make money while risking everyone's safety. It's a farce.\n\nThis is a fantastic idea\n\nWhat could go wrong...\n\nThat is crazy to me, as a yank. Ya‚Äôll act that crazy with out booze in the stands?\n\nDoesn‚Äôt apply in non-league. An important clarification.\n\nVery misleading headline.\n\nIt‚Äôs being trialled at two Women‚Äôs clubs, in a league where the average attendance is just 6,000.\n\nThis is light years from drinking being allowed in the men‚Äôs game, which would also include repealing an Act of Parliament.\n\nThe trial will last like 3 weeks I bet lol\n\ngotta increase revenue somehow\n\nThis is why I love non-league football. You can get a pint whenever you want (because the queues are small) AND you get to drink it while watching the match.\n\nI had no idea this was a thing in England.  Halftime must be a mad rush to the beer vendor.\n\nNever really understood how this rule would combat drunken violence or anything like that. Surely it woild just encourage fans to drink quickly at half time rather than drink slower throughout the match, which would have the opposite effect of what they're trying to achieve\n\nA bad move. Stand drinking has killed the atmosphere at big rubgy matches. This move won't do football any favours ...\n\nMohammed bin-Bamalam frothing rn\n\nWhat tier does the drinking ban go down to?\n\nFuck Margaret Thatcher.\n\nLucky yous, all alcohol has been banned in stadiums in scotland since a riot at a rangers v celtic game in 1980, I mean 44 years ago ffs.\n\nIf there's one group of Brits who can't handle their drink, it's football fans. I'd love to have a pint while I watch a game, but not if it also means I'll have Tommy and Spencer behind me falling over and showing themselves up\n\nIf there's one group of Brits who can't handle their drink, it's football fans. I'd love to have a pint while I watch a game, but not if it also means I'll have Tommy and Spencer behind me falling over and showing themselves up"

    "all_comment_text": "Was he inspired by Ryan Reynolds?\n\nI totally get it though. If I had that kind of money I'd definitely purchase a stake in a club too.\n\nNah. He's one of the owners for LAFC in the MLS as well. I think he might be genuine here.\n\nNever said anything about him not being genuine. Just thinking he may have seen Wrexham's story and thought ‚Ä≥that looks a lot of fun, I'd like to get involved with a British team too!‚Ä≥\n\nHe was invited to wrexham and they watched the game together.\n\nNo that was Chet Peterson, Head Caterer at Toyota\n\nI'm not fine, I SELL FUCKIN KIAS\n\nWelcome the beautiful cherry blossom\n\nIt‚Äôs definitely an influence\n\nI‚Äôm sure it might have inspired him but he‚Äôs also always been a pretty massive sports fan, so it could be two parallel things that lead to this.\n\nHe's been attending games since long before Reynolds and McElhenney were involved with Wrecsam.\n\nI mean, he was on during one of the episodes and watched a game with Ryan.\n\nHe attends like every game and is super involved with LAFC, I'd definitely say it's genuine\n\nIMO it‚Äôs better than having oil barons or those without any interest investing in the game.\n\nI mean Cities oil baron owners suck but they‚Äôve absolutely invested in the game. I know people hate them, but they‚Äôve invested a ton in youth sports, training coaches and facilities, and community outreach.\n\nIt‚Äôs the one small silver lining to an otherwise shitty situation.\n\nSo that's LAFC and LUFC. Who's next?¬†\n\nLeicester\n\nHe is a genuine lifelong ‚Äúsoccer‚Äù fan\n\nDidn‚Äôt you assholes see kicking and screaming? Best coach of all time. Turned a mediocre team into champions.\n\nUgh, don't be that asshole.\n\nNotice the quotation marks..?\n\nYeah?\n\nHe appears in season 1 of the Wrexham documentary. He was invited by Reynolds to watch some game. He didn't seem to have any idea about the rules.¬†\n\nI‚Äôd purchase a steak in a restaurant\n\nHe‚Äôs always been a football fan. I thought he was a Chelsea fan the past 20 years cos he was always at our games.\n\nIIRC he was on Men in Blazers years ago and said as a kid he dreamed of playing for the Fort Lauderdale Strikers (my club, which at the time were in an absolutely dire situation and could have used his help as an owner a lot more than LAFC/MLS did)\n\nYeah, I remember him being a Chelsea as well\n\nNo, Ferrel got in the game first.\n\nNo, he was inspired by LA Football Club.\n\nIt was actually Rob McElhenney‚Äôs idea and he asked Ryan Reynolds to do it with him\n\nI've seen him in the guest box at Wrexham a few times\n\nOne more American for Leeds fans to complain about\n\nAt least he can perform for 90 minutes\n\nStill probably in better shape than Weston McKennie last season\n\nAre Leeds fans *still* complaining about McKennie as if he was the only problem in that shit show of a season?\n\nWhat can I say man, in a sea of shite he stood out. Don't worry your little head though, we know how deep and wide was the shit.\n\nEh, he definitely had a bad season but I can‚Äôt say that‚Äôs too surprising for anyone on that team. They went through what, 4 different managers throughout the season?\n\nFrom the games I did happen to see (which tbf, isn‚Äôt a ton) the main player that stood out to me was Patrick Bamford. I can‚Äôt tell you how many sitters I watched him miss.\n\nAye Bamford gets a lot of stick as he tends to be pretty streaky with his goals, but in fairness he spent almost the whole season injured or being rushed back from injury and he'd been put for most of the previous season with plantar fasciitis which had made it impossible to kick a ball without immense pain.\n\nThey've all gone now¬†\n\nI thought he was already supposedly a Chelsea fan?\n\nDecided to up his standards to a proper club\n\nA proper championship club\n\nDoesn‚Äôt make us any less proper\n\nChampionship is the best football league in the uk might not be the highest skill bracket but definitely the best.\n\nThat's probably Chelsea in a few years\n\nYou might be confusing Chelsea with spurs there champ\n\nWho's higher in the league?\n\nI think a total of twice has Tottenham finished above Chelsea in what 40 years? We have as many CL trophies as your club has appearance in that comp. Please bro don‚Äôt get big for your shoulders. Go celebrate that Audi cup and pressure cup\n\nI'm not a spurs fan hahaha\n\nDayum he just lil bro‚Äôd you my boy\n\nYes he was\n\nYou think someone like Will Ferrell wants to be the second funniest person at Mudryk FC?\n\n3rd Poch's clown routine kills me everytime\n\nYeah but what‚Äôs he gonna do, buy a stake in us? He is probably more responsible with his money.\n\nWhy would you only buy a club you support?\n\nHe‚Äôs a fan of local sports team, happens all the time with wrestlers when the big companies have shows over here \n\nWhatever city the show is in the wrestler doing the promotion on a local TV/Radio show love the local sports team\n\nAmerican sports are more like entertaining. So changing your team isn't that uncommon\n\nTimes change üòÇ\n\nI don't mind, he isn't rich enough to spend forever, and Will Ferrel has executed like...half of what Newcastle's owners have.\n\nWait... Will Farrel half murdered and half sawed up a journalist?\n\nYou mean you didn‚Äôt hear about it?\n\nI'm streets behind clearly\n\nI felt like that journalist after watching his Sherlock Holmes movie.\n\nOkay look I'm not saying Will Ferrel is perfect, just better than the Saudi regime\n\nBy atleast half apparently\n\nHe did a tour of a few English League clubs last season, iirc. City, like in the image above, Wrexham, as previously mentioned, I think he was at Anfield for a game and maybe a London club as well. \n\nOn top of that, he part owns LAFC and has talked previously about Chelsea and English football in general. I think he's legit in his love of the game, tbf\n\nHe rocked up to a Pompey game in 2019 too.\n\nSeem to remember him at QPR last season\n\nI don‚Äôt really understand this sentiment that ‚Äúbig Hollywood stars just want to make money off of clubs‚Äù. This happens anyway, do you really think the current owners of clubs arnt in it for money?\n\nIt‚Äôs a nice way for owners to garner the nominal investment but get a lot of publicity in the same transaction. That‚Äôs fundamentally what every celebrity endorsement comes down to. The fluff about them ‚Äòloving it‚Äô is just there to make it more palatable for hardcore, otherwise skeptic, fans.\nWhether this is all a bad thing or not is completely open to debate I suppose.\n\ni try to think of this debate from the perspective of the new owner or owners with no real ties to football or the country....and then i remember that they have emotions too and they must be bored not having a routine that demands them to be in an office or warehouse, restaurant all the time, still left with a lot of disposable money.....i realize that maybe theres a moment where the opportunity comes or is mentioned by \"a guy who knows a guy\" and theyre excited to participate in something big like this, that doesnt have to do much with their primary profession. especially ferrells schtick. this is their hobby\n\nOwners are in it for lots of different reasons. Ego, business, and sometimes they really are just fans of the club like Tony Bloom\n\nplaying football manager for real\n\nOnly person that does it is Will Still.\n\nThey're not in it for the money, British clubs aren't great financial investments.\n\n\nThey are in it for the ego, though. It's a really cool toy to have.\n\nI don't think you really can be in it for the money when most clubs are loss making operations\n\nUm actually the other owners are in it to sanitize the image of their slave States\n\nHasnt Russell Crowe owned part of Leeds for years?\n\nWhy do people think they're making money?! Lucky if the club makes a profit let alone the owners\n\nWeird amount for negativity in here. There's a lot worse people you could have invest in your club than an inoffensive comedian who actually seems to like the game.\n\nFootball fans' obsessive hate for billionaires + Reddit's obsessive hate for the US\n\nIt was never gonna end well\n\n + Reddit‚Äôs obsessive hate for billionaires + Football fans obsessive hate for the US\n\nIf football fans really hated billionaires they‚Äôd stop buying outrageously priced ticket and showing up to games dressed head to toe in outrageously priced merch.\n\nThat's true\n\nTbh most of them on social media act like that either a) to get approval such as upvotes or likes or b) out of jealousy and a \"if we can't have good/rich owners, noone else can\" mentality\n\nNot US related but the first example I could think of, look at how quickly utd fans went from criticising the morals of City's Saudi owners to begging for Qatar to invest so they could compete again. In the same way, the teams around or below Leeds hate this because they wish it was their club instead\n\nI‚Äôve done exactly this. It doesn‚Äôt change much honestly.¬†\n\n&gt; Football fans' obsessive hate for billionaires \n\nOh no why won't anyone think of their poor feelings...fuck billionaires no matter who they are and what they do\n\na) that's a very sweeping generalisation, b) what team do you support btw\n\nIf you're a billionaire there's absolutely no change that you haven't used and hurt a lot of people in the process.\n\nDidn't answer the question\n\nI'm not going to answer your question so you can nitpick how I'm somehow supporting exactly what I'm opposing and polish your halo with it but I will say that I don't support any billionaire/commercial group team and *if* my team would end up in that category I wouldn't have a problem ditching them.\n\nPlus a guy who‚Äôs already invested in football before. He‚Äôs a minority owner of one of the best-run clubs in the MLS (LA FC).\n\nPart owner of LAFC and now Leeds, that checks out\n\nAfter LAFC and LUFC he'll be after Leyton Orient next\n\nOil tycoons or rich comedian who has some classic hilarious comedies who seems like a genuinely good guy and nice person? The negativity is insane in here lol\n\nHe now has stakes in LAFC and LUFC... next add Liverpool and La Paz to that and you have great potential for a new multi-club ownership, all with nice rebranded similar L*FC logo's. The fans would love that!\n\nLeyton Orient has joined the chat\n\nFuck, I should've known that one!\n\nSo many negative losers complaining about US owners.\n\nLike you care. Meanwhile City and Newcastle are owned by blood stained Arab regimes. \n\nEnglish nationalists are a pain.\n\nI mean if you go back far enough there‚Äôs always someone‚Äôs blood involved especially when it comes to billionaires, will Pharrell is relatively harmless as far as I‚Äôm aware\n\nJJ Watt has some ownership in Burnley\n\nDude did a soccer movie before it was hip\n\nFalling in love with making money from English football more like.\n\nIn fairness, if it were about money there are far better investments out there than sports team minority ownership.\n\nYankee owners are a serious threat to the game.\n\nYeah I wish all clubs just had more local &amp; humble owners like your own club, Man City.\n\nDamn I didn‚Äôt even realize the club badge on his account lmao. the irony is palpable\n\nI heard Man City were co-owned by a group of 115 local, humble fans.\n\nGlazers doing a fantastic job in Stretford\n\nAt the top, I agree. In lower divisions it seems to be a saving grace rn\n\nTom Brady definitely not a saving grace for us \n\nBut I'd say Will Ferrell is more of the Wrexham mould than the Brady mould, and he's been into football for ages\n\nYeah for some reason I don‚Äôt think Tom has any impact on that club other than financially. Maybe in a couple years he‚Äôll grow into the sport in which he owns a fooking team lol\n\n&gt;Yankee owners are a serious threat to the game.\n\nI'd be more concerned about certain journalist-murdering nation states, Russian mobsters, and Greek alleged drug traffickers owning clubs than I would be about Will Ferrell, but you do you I suppose.\n\nDon't recall any of them forcing rule changes or trying to form a super league. USA USA\n\nIt‚Äôs just a matter of time before the Super League comes to pass. Clubs hate UEFA making too much money off of them.\n\nJust like they did in 1992.\n\nIn 1992 the world saw a huge upset when Denmark won their first Euro title. It was massive how much it changed the game in Northern Europe.\n\nGreat deflection but we are talking about how the top six formed a breakaway league.\n\nImo, in the years ahead it‚Äôs going to happen again. Clubs hate sharing money with UEFA. They take too much money out of football.\n\nBending over for history clubs doesn't help. Look at the recent switch on coefficients\n\nThe kids are addicted to heroin, and the journalist trying to report the story has been cut into pieces, but at least big 5 leagues still compete for something sanctioned by UEFA, right?\n\nJust this week we saw how the American government responded to peaceful protesters. They currently hold a whistle-blower locked away in guantanamo bay and made Epstein commit suicide. They fund terrorist organisations, support Israels Apartheid of Palestine, bomb tents and mud huts as they spread their \"freedom\" across the globe.\nThe streets are lined with Fentanyl zombies and obese drive thru Karen's. \nInstitutionalised racism and modern day slavery in its legal system and prisons. \nStones in glass houses.\n\nI must have missed the moment that the US government bought an English football club.\n\nUnless you think Will Ferrell is a guard at Guantanamo Bay who pushes Fentanyl on the streets in his spare time, I'm not sure that any of what you said matters here.\n\nCome back when you check who owns Manchester City\n\nNot the US government...\n\n[deleted]\n\nCity and Chelsea were first to reject the super league.\n\n&gt; Tell me then what is wrong with investing in your football club?\n\n-Gouldybobs further in the comments. The duality of man ü§åüèΩ\n\nHere's the guy who's got a problem with Saudis.\n\nWeird, literally everyone in the comments so far seems to think the opposite of you\n\nYet nobody has commented anything to suggest American owners are not a threat to the game. \n\nAll we have had so far is what about ism, \"115 charges\" and something to do with owners from the wrong country.\n\nYou sir, live in a world of your own lmao. Enjoy it out there\n\nAnother deflection.\n\nTax free Yankee dollars.\n\nDude you deflected like 5 times during our original thread, people called you out and downvoted you to oblivion. \n\nAs many have suggested in the other thread, I‚Äôm not wasting more oxygen arguing with a brick wall. Please try to grow from this. Thanks.\n\nSincerely,\n-everyone\n\nHow come you deleted your posts?\nSomething to hide?\n\nYet to see a counter argument other than spouting no nout shite.\n\nI decided to spare your Reddit username so you didn‚Äôt get blasted my guy. It‚Äôs been hours since you got destroyed by the comments. Get a hobby ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nEdit: it‚Äôs still going up covering your name don‚Äôt worry about looking retarded lol it takes a while to come back from something this embarrassing\n\nIf irony was a person.\n\nMurderous dictatorships with human rights violations good\n\nAmerican comedians bad\n\nI am very smart\n\nThe cats out of the bag and Americans didn‚Äôt care about the game. It‚Äôs growing so fast that it wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if Americans owned dozens and dozens of clubs.  This is the tip of the iceberg and it‚Äôs never going back into the dark ages ever again especially with the World Cup coming.\n\nYanks love a franchise. Be it burgers or bombs\n\nNationalist alert\n\nAll welcome, apart from Yankee franchises. Trying to turn the world into Macdonalds\n\nArsenal, Liverpool, and Villa seem to be doing just fine.\n\nTheir owners are meeting and conspiring, introducing new rules to keep themselves at the top.\n\nThey don't invest in the game. They take away.\n\nThey want to limit how much they spend and it's not to benefit the football league. \n\nThe same muppets that tried to form a super league not too long ago..\n\nThey haven't got 116 charges to answer for yet though\n\nThat's ok then\n\nI want you to sit down and reflect on what you've just written\n\nRead it back and tell me what's wrong.\n\n&gt;Their owners are meeting and conspiring, introducing new rules to keep themselves at the top.\n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5021879/amp/The-night-Arsenal-Liverpool-Man-United-chiefs-met-NYC.html one example shortly before the super league attempt. FFP rules were adapted shortly after this conveniently as united were about to fall short..\n\nImo, it‚Äôs just a matter of time before a Super League comes to pass. Clubs don‚Äôt like sharing money with UEFA.\n\nMaybe he thought this move would secure him more leads.\n\nCannonball!!!!!\n\nI could of sworn he has shares in Burnley aswell, not 100% sure though.\n\nKind of a big deal\n\nOh wow they‚Äôre all at it\n\nGot it on discount, probably had a coupon.\n\nWell guess im watching more of leeds games\n\nhere I'm now hoping Kendrick Lamar and Drake each buy into a team, That rivalry will be pushed to another level lol.\n\nü§¢\n\nI‚Äôve got a soft spot for Leeds so I‚Äôm fine with it.\n\nPerfect club for a comedian\n\nI think Tom Brady also owns part of Leeds\n\nbirmingham\n\nHe meant to say \"a new money printing machine\"\n\nIt's becoming a new thing among rich actors.\n\nI thought he supported Chelsea?\n\nTheir midfield could use an Anchorman\n\nCould show the boys how to up their acting skills\n\nDidn't Will Ferrell support Chelsea?\n\nGotta get a team to support while the LA King got sent packing for golf again\n\nEnglish teams still haven't learned that Americans will eventually ruin your club ü§£\n\nGod help you all ....\n\nPlease dont let this be a trend, i would rather we finish mid table Championship for the rest of my life than the Rock buys North End and tourists and plastics fill the stands\n\n[deleted]\n\nwell Wrexham still a shit hole even after the Hollywood money just a shame lot of the local fans cant get on the ground after watching them through the dark days. The amount of so called Liverpool fans wearing Wrexham shirts now here in the states. End up like Man City fans not remembering whrn they were shit and played lower league late 90s\n\n[deleted]\n\nits more about loyalty for us , i know a lot of fans feel the same way especially lower league. I dont know what team you support but being from Lancashire with so many local teams its like when Rovers got that Walker money and won the Premiership and went from 4-5000 average to 20,000 plus over night. just hate glory hunters\n\nAt least you understand the trade-off unlike a lot of fans\n\nRyan renolds also bought into necaxa(üá≤üáΩ) I believe Will has a stake in LA Galaxy already.\n\nWill is an owner of LA FC not the Galaxy.\n\nNo LAFC, the rival club\n\nLafc would clap the ever lasting shit outta them\n\nChampionship football will be good to watch. As a Leeds fan I'm pleased to see investment...but gutted that we are bottlers\n\nYeah, i was expecting Coke to buy us, considering the amount of bottling we do\n\nLegit made me laugh out loud\n\nA Chelsea fan goes and buys a stake at Leeds. Yup, that doesn't sound really good.\n\nAnyone think all these actors from North America suddenly loving football teams and investing in teams outside the premier league with ambitions to get them to the premier league coupled with the news the league isn‚Äôt against games being played outside on the UK could be connected \n\nSuper league didn‚Äôt work, now they are looking for another more convert way to Americanize the premier league, either that or I‚Äôm bored on my break in work so I‚Äôm just typing up a crazy conspiracy on Reddit\n\nThe Super League will eventually come to pass as clubs hate sharing money with UEFA.\n\nLeeds????!!!!!\n\nHe just wanted to have a PL club before RR\n\nAnother Hollywood star looking to make bank off of the back of English fans. How original.\n\nCan‚Äôt have fell in love with it that much if he chose Leeds\n\nOh...seems like the rich fucks from Hollywood are finding a new toy to play with.\n\nLiterally no different from any owner of a football club.\n\nPulling a Ryan Reynolds to try and keep himself relevant. Expect more of this."

    "all_comment_text": "After just 23 minutes for new club makes it sound like they announced his signing at 12pm and he retired at 12:23pm lol\n\nSome fm logic.\n\nI've had a guy break his knee literally 8 minutes after arriving at the club. Presumably tripped down a km of stairs\n\nImagine buying a guy but he never even leaves the plane\n\nDude\n\nI literally thought \"Why would you sign for a club and then retire during your introduction?\"\n\nIts the club who actually removed him from the club squad list for whole SerieA ¬†24/25 season after he picked up serious injury in his first game which eventually led him announcing his retirement.¬†\n\nI think he was injured playing his first match for the club. It was a bad way to go out.¬†\n\nü§£ yup\n\nReally?  Seems like anyone with a discerning mind would pick up on the meaning pretty quickly.\n\nStill only 31, such a shame his body couldn't keep up. Despite all their triumphs, it's still disappointing how the rock solid, World Cup winning center back pairing of Varane and Umtiti struggled for fitness for so many years.\n\nUmtiti sacrificed his health and career for this World Cup, in the end\n\nDon‚Äôt forget Varane was playing at the highest level at 19\n\n18 even\n\n18. And he kept Pepe from getting his starting spot back after coming back from injury for a while.\n\nFunny enough, Pepe endured much longer and always at a high level.\n\nYep wonder how Yamal and Bellingham will be in a few years since they're playing at such an unbelievable level at such a young age.\n\nThey need to look after themselves to prevent premature burnout. It's not just Varane. It happened with Rooney and Owen as well: boy wonders who couldn't sustain their careers at the top level careers till the mid 30s even though they played in the modern era with the best of sport science.\n\nI'm worried about Saka burning out as well for this reason.\n\nSaka by 30 will not be the same player. He will have to pivot to play as left back, like Ashley Young, in order to stay relevant for longer. Wingers don't have lenghty careers at the top level in the current meta.\n\nI wonder if as the game continues to improve, wingbacks would become even more of a fullback-winger hybrid like it already is becoming.\n\nI mean the general trend is that all players are becoming more rounded players. Everyone needs to contribute in both attack and defense. So yes, but it‚Äôs not position specific.\n\nOne season wonder Mo Salah may want to have a word in this discussion.\n\nSalah didn't start playing regularly at a high level until he was 22-23. Saka has been playing the majority of games for Arsenal since he was 18.\n\nSaka needs resting for cup games in the early rounds and was that the case against Bolton?\n\nExcept Pedro, who is built different.\n\nR9 didn‚Äôt last that long either\n\nR9 injuries are still the saddest ones. Was still a World Class player even without his knees, but damn. What could've been.\n\nHim and Van Basten‚Ä¶man, why is it always the best players?\n\nFrom what I‚Äôve seen, a lot of defenders who can‚Äôt keep up try to injure the best players. Goikoetxea did it to Maradona. \n\nI‚Äôve seen multiple clips of defenders trying to do the same to Yamal.\n\nThree ballon d'ors, retired at age 28 while being injured for that last two years. So much potential for even more while already being up there at the upper echelon of footballers in history.\n\nI can't help but feel like Ronaldo's downfall is the most tragic loss we've seen in football. The man was easily the best player in the world back in his PSV/Barcelona days, with practically everything in his locker; pace, strength, mobility, supreme shooting ability and an incredible winning mentality to boot. He was an absolute menace and struck fear into every opponent who was unfortunate enough to cross paths with him. To think that he had already begun declining severely by the age of 25 (after his first knee injury) is just so sad. We should all consider ourselves lucky that Messi managed to withstand his early injury woes (back in like 2005-2007) and that he could enjoy the longevity he's had. Considering how much he's been man-handled in his career, it is a minor miracle he's been able to play for as long and as consistently as he has. I know it sounds silly, but I almost feel like the fact that Messi was allowed a long and healthy career was like a divine intervention after another god-given talent, Ronaldo, suffered so many injuries which hampered his career.\n\nRooney had off field issues that greatly contributed to his early decline. Not saying it isn‚Äôt relevant to the situation at hand, but he‚Äôs more in that ‚Äúwhat if?‚Äù category. It wasn‚Äôt an injury or string of injuries that forced him into retirement but rather his alcoholism and personal life problems.\n\nI feel you're underestimating his mileage, especially given his style of play. Yes, someone like CR7 had a healthier lifestyle, but he also preserved himself by becoming less involved in the build up play and converting himself to a poacher instead of a winger before turning 30. But Rooney played with ferocity till the end, making last ditch goal line clearances and tackles even when dropping deeper as his FA Cup winning run showed at the end of his time at United. As for his personal life problems, I think he's always been mentally strong, so that wasn't *that* big an issue. Cue: boxing celebration.\n\nOwen was destroyed because of injuries at a young age rather than burnout though\n\nThe impact of high stress on a still-developing body can never be stressed enough though.\n\nRooney's is genetics and lifestyle as much as anything.\n\nYamal at least seems conscious of it sadly due to what he's been seeing happening to Pedri\n\nThey‚Äôre gonna be cooked. Bellingham is a bigger lad so he might have a better chance but my hopes aren‚Äôt high for Yamal.\n\nI don't think him being a bigger lad is a help. More size just means more shear force on joints and more force production in muscles.\n\nBut also means he isn‚Äôt more liable to get torn in half by defenders. You make a good point though.\n\nBellingham can change positions and play as striker when he gets older. Has the conditions and body type to do well there.\n\nRight.\n\nCristiano Ronaldo was a starter at Sporting CP when he was 17yo and at 18yo was playing at Man Utd.\n\nAnd in his first years Ronaldo was a very fast very-difficult-to-stop winger, he suffered much more tackles than a center back.\n\nStarting young doesn't mean much, it depends on how players take care of themselves, injuries and their natural physical condition.\n\nTo an extent yes, Ronaldo is also an anomaly and probably the best example ever of longevity and taking care of his body. Not exactly fair to compare the two. 12 years at the very highest level is still an incredible achievement.\n\nYeah people need to stop using Messi and Ronaldo as examples for everything. Two freaks of nature that we‚Äôve never seen before and will probably never see again.\n\nModric and Zlatan too\n\nDifferent, great players with great longevity don‚Äôt get me wrong but even they weren‚Äôt in Messi and Ronaldo‚Äôs league and weren‚Äôt playing for the biggest clubs in the world since 18\n\nZlatan isn‚Äôt far off that though, Ajax at 20ish and then 20 years of top level play.\n\nAnd also came back after an ACL when he was over 35\n\n[deleted]\n\nStanley Matthews would like a word. Although admittedly the demands made on his body were of a different level of intensity to modern players, to still be playing top-flight football at the age of 50 (and still being called up by England when he was 42), with a career in the old English first division that stretched from 1932 to 1965, is pretty fucking impressive. Man kept himself fit. Oh, and he was a winger.\n\nLuck of the draw as well sometimes. Ronaldo has done everything right and at the same time he's been lucky to never have any career ending injuries or awful misfortune with recurring niggles or the ilk. \n\nSometimes you can do everything right and your body still just isn't your friend.\n\nRonaldo is a machine. Can‚Äôt really compare even most athletes to him.\n\nMessi then. Messi started playing for Bar√ßa at 17yo.\n\nIt's known he had some grow/health issues when young.\nIt's far from an example of spectacular physical condition.\n\n\nWhat I was saying is..it's not a matter of how young they started, it's how they care themselves, injuries (or lack of) and natural physical condition.\n\nA player ending a career at 31yo isn't because he started early it's because he had a career ending injury or he had really bad physical condition and didn't took care of himself.\n\n30 - 40 years ago a pro player ending a career at 31yo could be +/- expected. \n\nWith current medical treatment and all that jazz that pro players have now it's expected they're at top level until 33-34yo and still be able to play at high level until 35-36yo if they wanted.\n\nGeneral rule in football, don‚Äôt use the most insane physical freak in the games history as the standard. Hope this helpsüëç\n\nThe difference is that messi and ronaldo started in arguably the best teams of the world at that time (even without them), with sensible managers who wer sure of their positions long term. Meaning that the managers could safely let them adjust to the highest level (like pep could do with foden). Also in that time there were way fewer games and longer time inbetween those games. \nI looked at Messi, Ronaldo, Zlatan, Bellingham, Yamal at 19 (and 16). The oldies all had less then 3000 minutes played.\n\nYamal had more than 3000 + national team (at only 16), he played in 50 games for barca, bellingham had almost 4000 minutes for dortmund + national team.\n\nTbf varane was doing well post world cup and only really started to struggle around his last season with madrid\n\nWas undoubtedly one of the best defenders from 2014 to 2020. An absolute beast of a defender\n\nSuch a great fit next to Ramos, what a pair that was.\n\nSorry, I know it's a Varane appreciation post, but Pepe Ramos was **the** cb pairing of that era.\n\nAbsolutely, Ramos had two great CB mates.\n\nHe was better than Ramos. But the casuals are ready for that conversation\n\nEh, depends what you mean. Only defensively, perhaps. Varane was super quick too. But passing, technically and offensive Ramos was way better. Plus Ramos made his partner better. Whenever he was suspended or injured Real was significantly worse, way more impact than any other defender.\n\nAll in all, I would pick Ramos ahead of Varane any day of the week. And I absolutely loved Varane\n\nLmao ‚Äòcasuals‚Äô. Varane was a top defender and quite underrated but in no way is he better than ramos\n\nYeah, no he wasnt. I get some people dont like Ramos but man what a player that was. His aggressive playstyle led to some great counter attacks, but also a bunch of red cards. He also scored a fucking ton of goals, more than both Xavi and Iniesta for example.\n\nAbsolutely delusional. Sergio Ramos might be the greatest CB of all time.\n\nWayy too far lmao\n\nWho was better than 4x CL, 2x Euro, 1x WC winning Ramos with winning goals in TWO finals? Fucking haters.\n\nPaulo Maldini wasn't bad... Of course the utter casual thinks team accomplishments and GOALS is the best way to judge a DEFENDER...\n\nMaldini was the best LB of his era but he wasnt the best CB. That would be Baresi. Returning to Ramos being the best though, he wasn't even the best of his era, that would be Puyol followed by Terry with Ramos third.\n\nDid you even watch Maldini play or are you just regurgitating shit you've read online/been told by YouTubers?\n\nMaldini was primarily a left-back, genius.\n\nHe started at fullback then transitioned to CB... Just like Ramos lmao.\n\n\n\n\nRamos scored goals in champions league finals sure but as far as defending goes there's been alot better, John Terry was a much better defender for one.\n\nJohn Terry was better than Sergio Ramos? Cool story, bro.\n\nLol ok pal\n\nLet's not go that far m8\n\nRolls Royce of a defender\n\nI'd argue he peaked at a very young age. When he was 19-21 he was a fucking beast, then injuries started to happen too often and he was caught off guard way too much, but was still solid.\n\nWithout [paywall](https://archive.ph/gstc7)\n\nthank you! the audacity of mirror to have the option ‚Äòreject and pay‚Äô is insane as well\n\nPeople wanting to be paid for work is ridiculous!\n\npeople wanting to be paid for work by someone OTHER than their employer is indeed ridiculous yeah, don‚Äôt you think?\n\nAnd how does the employer get the money they are supposed to use in issuing said payment?\n\nI‚Äôm pretty sure they run ads? And if they can‚Äôt turn a profit without forcing users to pay for their privacy, maaaybe it‚Äôs time for a different occupation\n\nHe's not exactly had a bad career and god only knows how much money he's made. I wish I could retire at 31.\n\nThis + the recent Rodri stuff makes me wonder how much longer could his career have lasted with modern sports science and a run of games that isn‚Äôt built to destroy players bodies with no rest while maximizing advertising dollars\n\nBy my calculations during his time with Manchester United he made approximately 7000 Euros per minute played. (51M/7246m)\n\nYeah I wish I was forced to stop doing the thing I‚Äôm passionate about at 31 as my body physically can‚Äôt do it any more.\n\nMoney doesn‚Äôt heal all wounds.\n\nBut it sure does comfort the blow\n\nFr, the only reason most of us keep going even if it's a job we hate is because we need to make sure we / our loved ones are supported enough. \n\nHe can stop now knowing that no matter where life takes him he and his family will be okay financially.\n\nI had to stop playing football at 35 because my body physically couldn‚Äôt do it any more.  Even at the level of just having a kick about in the park with mates.  \n  \nThe money would‚Äôve helped.\n\nSame here. I started getting terrible shin splints and compartment syndrome when I turned 28. Tried physical therapy, got fitted for orthotics, playing only as a sub, etc. The pain never got better and I had to quit.\n\nI‚Äôm sure it would have helped. Doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt be sad.\n\nHe can still work in the world of football and clearly intends to. He still gets to work with his passion every day.\n\nSure but there‚Äôs a huge drop off when playing and the camaraderie that comes with it and then coaching.\n\nSad, but he's only losing a few years at the top compared with the average footballer. It's worse when you see a young guy who has to retire due to injury.\n\nAgreed\n\nHe can still play football if he wants\n\nI get that everyone's struggles are unique and just as intense to them even if it looks less severe from the outside but this is a weird hill to choose\n\nMy point is it‚Äôs disingenuous to just say ‚Äúhe‚Äôs rich anyway, I have no sympathy because he has more money than me‚Äù\n\nIt's not \"more money than me\" though. It's more money than I could even conceive spending in 5 lifetimes.\n\nLike he's played a game for a living and is set for life at 31. Sucks for him he can't keep going but let's not shed tears here. Perspective\n\nThat‚Äôs still the same point. Just because he‚Äôs well off doesn‚Äôt diminish how he feels, he‚Äôs human after all. \n\nI‚Äôm not even really a fan of the guy (no personal dislike but he‚Äôs played for two teams I despise), but it‚Äôs not nice for someone clearly passionate about something having to pack it in early. Having money doesn‚Äôt balance negative emotions.\n\nMany professionals have spoken out about mental health issues, some caused by injuries and some caused by other issues, and the people just saying ‚Äúyeah well you‚Äôre rich you don‚Äôt get to complain‚Äù are a major problem.\n\nMost of their mental health issues come from having too much money too young. I really think you should be focusing your empathy on other areas of society, not the super rich. They can all collectively do one. Pro footballer that‚Äôs played at the top level for 15 years having to retire 3/4 years early doesn‚Äôt even deserve a thought. Great player, well done and off you pop onto the next great opportunity non of us will ever have\n\nHang on, who said I don‚Äôt empathise with others too? You‚Äôre jumping to conclusions.\n\nI get what you're trying to say. Unfortunately, not everyone understands that misery and misfortune are relative. Some people only see things in simplistic ways.\n\nHe can still work in football. Be a coach, and in future even a manager. He can still play casually in training. Retiring from playing is not the end at all.\n\nYeah I bet the fella who‚Äôs competitive and driven enough to win 4 Champions Leagues will be made up having a kick about with the boys in training\n\nAnd Como are okay with it? SURELY there has to be someone there who isn't happy with it at all seeing as he was a big signing for them, meant to be their defensive leader.\n\nHis body can't hack it anymore, which they knew was a big risk when they signed him; that's the only reason he's there in the first place. That's not much for them to not be ok with, players retire because their body is done all the time.\n\nYes, I don't disagree with that they can't really do much about it, but if they didn't count on him being able to play at least a little bit more they wouldn't have signed him at all.\n\nComos owners are billionaires who had a clear strategy: get a well-liked and well-know ex-pros on board to create publicity. Signing Varane also got them publicity. If he was able to play more, they would have gotten even more publicity, but even like this they probably already got what they wanted: Their club was mentioned a lot during the summer.\n\nYou know he's severely injured right? Did his knee after only 20mins on the pitch, also probably on huge wages. So for cuomo this is a relief.\n\nThey took a risk, they were aware this was quite likely to happen. I don't think they did plan on him playing loads of games due to his history.\n\nHe may move into coaching and why not capitalise on his knowledge and experience while he‚Äôs there.\n\nI imagine they aren‚Äôt happy, but at least he‚Äôs called it a day now rather than robbing a living off of them with no prospect of ever truly being fit to play‚Ä¶.\n\nWhy wouldn't they be in these circumstances? He suffered an injury and rather than pay him big wages while he is injured, he is off the books.\n\nThey‚Äôll como around\n\nIn his retirement statement he mentioned he'd stay with Como, but not as a player.\n\nafaik he was already expected to be out for the entire season due to the injury he picked up in the pre-season\n\nThe season for him was already gone with the injury. My guess is that the club renegotiated with him the second year of the 2 year contract and ended up with Varane agreeing to take another position at the club.\n\nCrap he's in my UT, will EA get rid of his card?\n\nHe will most likely get an EOA card in the coming weeks. (End of and era card)\n\nEOA = end of an era?  how does that work, I can see 'end of' but what does that A stand for? the last letter in 'era'?\n\nThb i don‚Äôt know. It‚Äôs just the abreviation the fifa community has been using for years. And I might have typed it wrong and missed an E. So I guess EOAE would be more correct.ü§∑üèº\n\nthat would be pretty dumb on their part. EOAE isn't exactly easy to pronounce, and it's only 1 syllable less than the full term which is much easier to say. I can't imagine ppl saying EOA or EOAE irl it's so weird to say out loud, ie. \"hey did you get the new EOA?\" or \"omg I pulled the best EOAE yesterday!\"\n\nYup\n\nWhy are you focusing on how it's said, it's clearly just a shortening for text. Nobody says \"TOTY\"  out loud either but it's a hell of a lot better than typing Team Of The Year everywhere\n\nHe peaked so early it feels like he never truly reached his potential even though he won every major trophy for both club and country besides a Euro Cup\n\nGood for him.. He could've stayed in rehab and cashed his cheques.. Hanging boots is the right thing for him.\n\nThank you for everything Raphael Varane. Go and enjoy your retirement.¬†\n\nHe was great in his last game for Man Utd against City in the FA cup, which they went on to win.\n\nLegend. Did well with him on FM\n\nOnly 31, massive shame his body isn't up to it. On his day a great player, fortunately he can look back on a short but very successful career. Achieved more than most players ever will in the game.\n\nThey must be thinking, \"How?\"¬†\n\nCan't believe he's 31 I was sure he was 34 or 35\n\nHis transfer to Como was a glorified paid holiday\n\nI guess bro is no como.\n\n23 minutes. What Serie A does to a mf\n\nwhat happened at como?\n\nHad a great career, injuries stopped him playing at his best form for the past couple of years. Enjoy the retirement.\n\nsad news. He played well at RM\n\nThe first and only defender to make me look up a defensive skills compilation on youtube on his debut season. Just unreal defending all along.\n\nI'll never forget you Raphael Varane, thank you for everything. Enjoy riding into the sunset now! :'D ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nJeez he‚Äôs 31??? Makes sense I guess doing as I am as well. I remember I used to sign him all the time in fifa 12/13 back in my university years.\n\nHe‚Äôs been washed for years.\n\nSad to see him retiring at 31. He is a great and legendary player for Real Madrid and Man U. I would like Man U should appoint him in academy as mentor/ defense coach. His knowledge and experience will benefit our young talent to grow in this area as in last few season injuries has shown how badly we need to invest in this area and academy players are best to be invested upon.\n\nLegendary at man u? prob not.\n\nDamn, that's a real shame. Truly feel sorry for him and the club. \n\n/Arsenal fan\n\nHe started when he was super young didn't he and has been playing non stop. \n\nA lot of players could end up with the same fate. Saka being one of them. Or at least start their declines much earlier. Rooney had the same thing happen, although with him he wasn't exactly focused on elite fitnessn\n\nCan someone explain to me, how good was varane at manchester United? \n\nIt's really hard to believe how varane and casemiro not performed well together. \n\nI have watch both of them play since 2011 until 2020.\n\nThey always performed well in that period, I watched them play.\n\nWhen fit, he was far and above the best defender we‚Äôve had since Vidic and Ferdinand.\n\nComo matip\n\nChelsea used to be the club where football careers would go downhill and die.\n\nLooks like Manchester United stole that title.\n\nThis is insane,and petty at the same time\n\nPetty, how?\n\nI meant petty from the club's side,not Varane\n\nStill, how has the club been petty about it?"

    "all_comment_text": "Thank you Gareth. He gave us some good memories but his limits were obvious.\n\nLuke Shaw scoring vs Italy was the peak of his era\n\nAnd failing to set us up with pace to run at Italy's ageing backline for the rest of the game sums up his tenure\n\nPretty much. That game was in the bag as soon as Shaw scored, but we bottled it\n\nI still cringe at the memory of Mason Mount getting beaten in the air by 4'7\" Marco Veratti to set up their equaliser\n\nUgh Mason Mount\n\nYeah ikr. As a Chelsea fan he no longer has a place back at Chelsea\n\nIm sure he wouldn‚Äôt want to\n\nI watched the highlights. Other than the goal it was all Italy\n\nYep, thank him for making England look like an underdog, no matter the odds or the opponents\n\nMy thoughts exactly. Wish we'd won one of the two finals but his reign fulfilled many of our childhood dreams. \n\nNot long ago people would have laughed at you if you suggested we'd reach a final.\n\nIt‚Äôs not fulfilled by dreams at all. I dream of us lifting a trophy and with this quads at his disposal it should have happened at least once.\n\n'Fulfilled many' means that it's fulfilled some but not all.\n\nNot taking the lead in a WC semi final ???\n\n\nAre you serious¬†\n\nI am serious yea. That Euros run was so special to me and Luke Shaw putting an end to all his critics and capping off a great tournament for him was incredible. I still watch it back sometimes. Life felt like it peaked. Everything that followed though, I wish I could forget.\n\nWe won the first half üòé\n\nWhat are you thanking for? Poor piss performance?\n\nI really don't think you understand how bad the feelings towards the National Team was before Southgate came in.\n\nYou genuinely thought they had a chance this year right? Could you say that 8 years ago?\n\nIf we go on to win in 2026 or 2028 people will rightly say he laid those foundations. He's given us a platform to build on with a great young side.\n\nIf we go on to win, I think people will remember him very fondly, and his final defeats will be glossed over. Time will tell.\n\nOr they might say, ‚Äúwhat could have been?‚Äù If they had a proper manager.\n\nDid he birth Cole Palmer or Jude Bellingham? He just plays negative football and has very good players. Not winning anything across this golden period is either unlucky or poor form on him. Never an amazing effort.\n\nGoing to give Southgate his flowers. He's done some things absolutely right, and there is no doubt that we're in a much better situation to finally win something because of him in many aspects (nation has seemingly healed its relationship with the England Team, his work prior at St. Georges Park and with U-21 structure, Media relations have improved, the players actually WANT to be there).\n\nHe is in no way a tactical mastermind when the whistle blows, but he has gotten us to a WC Semi-Final, and 2 EUROs finals, and he will deserve credit for that.\n\nBut it also 100% time to move on and let someone who can build on top of his behind scenes stuff actually deliver better on pitch performances and get us over that last hurdle. And if/when we do finally win something, I hope he gets remembered for resetting us.\n\nYeah it would be nice to have him around in some capacity, the players seem to like working with him.\n\nFirst time the team has felt like a team rather than a group thrown together and told to get on with it.\n\n&gt;nation has seemingly healed its relationship with the England Team\n\nI wish this were true, but the team was booed repeatedly this tournament despite reaching the final.\n\nHe was booed, not the team.\n\nTbh he has pretty good results 2 finals and a semifinal in the last 4 years. Not sure whether a \"better\" manager could get the same.\n\nThe draw has been far more favourable to England in the tournaments under Southgate than it ever has. Two finals, one semi and the best side we‚Äôve beaten was the Netherlands last week. The ‚Äò90, ‚Äò96 and ‚Äò02/‚Äò04 teams all get to the finals we have if given the same draw.\n\nPreach\n\nThe 02 team got Brazil because they couldn't top the group.  They would of had turkey if they did.\n\nThey still would have had Brazil in the semis, assume it was due to the split hosts. Germany got to the final despite not being a good side, England went out in the quarters playing the eventual winners - role reversal of this tournament.\n\nYeah but we would of had turkey in the quarters. \n\nPeople scoff at Southgates teams finishing top of the group when those before him with better teams couldn't do it.  2010 is another one.  Second to USA. Should of had Ghana instead got walloped by Germany.\n\nThat 2002 group contained Argentina though. I‚Äôm not saying that England have been awash with great managers or success, but Southgate has had some huge luck when it comes to the sides we‚Äôve faced.\n\nYeah and we beat them.  So to not won the group is even worse surely? He has had luck but you can't beat him with it because France and belgium didn't win their group and we did.\n\nAgreed the draw has been so so kind to them, they got to the WC semi final playing Columbia and Sweden for fucks sake.\n\nkind of pitiful how the most successful manager in 58 years was treated by the fans and press.  sure he's not perfect but he took the team to 2 finals which is more than belgium can say with their (arguably more talented) \"golden generation.\"  i guess now that the boat anchor is off there's no excuses if england don't win the next tourney, right?\n\nI honestly think Englands success has been in spite of him, not because of him. England have survived purely on individual brilliance alone, hes entirely tactically inept.\n\nYou are going to be so fucking disappointed in two years time\n\nThat Bellingham last minute volley against Slovenia is still fresh in my mind. A better manager would NOT have let it come to such a moment. Southgate deserves very little praise for that\n\nSo Zidane and Ancelotti don't deserve praise for Real Madrids escapes? Or are they shit and it was all individual brilliance too?\n\nZidane and Ancelotti didn't pass it around the back against Real Zaragoza for 90 minutes did they?\n\nDriving a Porsche will make you go fast but doesn‚Äôt make you a good driver.\n\nFA: *twirling hair* Hey Jurgen, how‚Äôs it goinggggg? Hope your holiday is fun‚Ä¶ quick question‚Ä¶\n\n\"Oh my God, Jurgen, you're like _soooo_ funny'\n\nüòÇüòÇüòÇ\n\nBoth the FA and The US men‚Äôs national team right now. Lol\n\nJurgen Klinnsman\n\nNo, not him! Herr Klopp\n\nExpected. Question is who‚Äôs next?\n\nPotter or Howe\n\nRoy Hodgson\n\nWe love you Woy\n\nKlopp\n\nMourinho is the funniest, and therefore best answer\n\nHow to undo all Southgate's good work in half an hour.\n\nEven a diminished Mourinho is like 100000000000000 times a better manager than Southgate lmao\n\nMourinho might be a better tactician but Southgate is a better man-manager and has constructed a squad in which everyone works together, previous generations of England players point to the dis-unity in the squad. Mourinho would undo all that, he creates disharmony wherever he goes it's why he hasn't lasted very long in his recent jobs. If it were June 2026 and we needed a coach for a quick shot at glory then Mourinho all day, there wouldn't be enough time to reap chaos.\n\nHe‚Äôs too much of a good man manager that it impacts his judgement, we lost Euros 2020, WC 22, and this Euros because he‚Äôs too stubborn to take any risks and drop certain players.\n\nHe dropped Henderson, Rashford and Grealish so he's not afraid of taking some risks but my feeling was that he didn't put together a system in which his players were comfortable and so they eked out results with \"moments\" rather than control.\n\nThis is a structural problem with English football and not something Southgate could solve on his own. We pick 11 players who would‚Äôve been the best player on their school team and throw them together, rather than create a system and pick players who fit the positions. It‚Äôs always been this way.\n\nIf the FA themselves can't see it, Southgate was the best placed of any England manager in our lifetimes to make a call like this.\n\nRashford and Grealish were never a favourite of Gareth‚Äôs, he would always start Sterling over them, he had to drop them all because they barely played well for their clubs. But other clubs players like Kane, Walker, Trippier, Stones are just bad recently in an England shirt.\n\nRashford played in every qualifying game apart from the first two, he missed through injury and Grealish was always in the squad too. As for your list we are no longer flush with defenders he didn't have much alternative to Stones and Trippier, while somehow screwing up the relationship with Ben White leaving not much alternative to Walker either. I thought they played the wrong system for Kane and should have had Watkins instead.\n\nMourinho after losing to Venezuela in the round of 16:\n\n\"Three. That is the number of lions on the shirt, but it is also the number of times I won the premier league. Respect respect respect.\"\n\nPotter\n\nMou\n\nMonths ago Tuchel was interested\n\nNo English manager has the balls to do what Southgate didnt dare. Bench big names\n\nBig Jurgen\n\nKlopp or Klinsmann? ;-)\n\nJust want to say, well done Gareth, thanks for giving something to believe in and to cheer for. It was close and you definitely improved the team and got a lot right.   \n\nI wish you well for the future wherever you go\n\nGet Karl Pilkington in.\n\nI'd love to see a one hour special of Karl Pilkington being the manager in training and then playing a friendly with them as the manager. I don't know if he's into football but I imagine his tactics and strategy meetings would be phenominal.\n\nWhy is the goalkeeper 2 foot 7 and swinging from the crossbar?\n\nTurns out. Little monkey fella\n\nHe'll put Clive Warren in goal\n\nHe‚Äôll be gutted not getting Rebecca De Mornay in.\n\n‚ÄúYou go up front‚Ä¶ a bit. You‚Äôre lazy. You pull your finger out‚Äù\n\nBetter managers than Southgate have done worse with England; so credit where its due. Whoever takes over can build on his foundations and write their name in the history books.\n\nother teams were stronger when those \"better\" managers were around...\n\ndon't think england was the favorites to win against the golden generation of spain, the top dutch sides from bergkamp to van persie, the italian team with buffon and co, zidane and henry for france and even portugal with figo, Ronaldo etc. don't even need to mention germany.\n\nand also that whole trying to fit lampard with gerrard experiment.\n\n\nalso what is up with that whole deal with ben white.\n\nSomebody is always stronger than everyone else, didn't stop Greece from winning Euro 2004.\n\nWho can ever forget everybody and their gran arguing whether Gerrard and Lampard could play in the same team? The fact nobody was prepared to change from 4-4-2 or even leave either player out of the starting 11 is a damning indictment of the mindset at the time.\n\nGood. He was the right man for the right job at the right time. Now, it is time for the next step.\n\nIn before pep leaves city before the charges come in and starts coaching England team\n\nOn the plus side, he will probably be able to get the Foden to finally perform.\n\nI sure hope he does! Foden is an amazig player but he had a rough Euros, pep knows how he plays and should be able to use him properly\n\nPalmer will never play again\n\nI imagine Pep having three days every two months to try to implement his style having Kane at front that can't even run.\n\n\nWould be tragic for both Pep and England. I hope it happens.\n\nI doubt Pep would manage a team that has to accurately declare what it pays him anymore.\n\nI'd fucking love that!\n\nIt would be cool to see what he does with the players. England got some reall talent and im betting pep knows how to use it\n\nSounds mad, but also highly likely.\n\nWhy? Just because, he already lives in England?  \n\nJust because he knows most of the England squad already from managing in the Prem, several of which are in his own current team?  \n\nJust because has done pretty much everything there is to do in club football with his current team?\n\nJust because he‚Äôs an attacking manager when the England team is attack talent heavy?\n\nJust because England are a club that have been moulded into a great team that just need an elite manager to take them over the line? Something he is an expert at?\n\nJust because he has yet to prove himself as a national team manager to complete his CV but doesn‚Äôt identify with his own national team because he‚Äôs from Catalan?\n\nJust because his biggest personal rival (Klopp) is tipped to potentially take over Englands biggest rivals (Germany) in the near future?\n\n~~but other than that what have the romans ever done for us~~\n\nOther than that I can‚Äôt see any reason he‚Äôd want the England job\n\nThe stage is set.\n\nWouldn‚Äôt that be a betrayal to Spain ? What happens when Spain and England  play each other\n\nPep is from Catalan and supports breaking away from the rest of Spain\n\n47 Spain caps\n\nWhere else would he play\n\nHe obviously doesn't hate the Spain team if he played for them\n\nMaybe Klopp can do it?\n\nIm hearing rumors he might be going to germany international team. Dont know if thats real or just hot air, but tbh Klopp wanted a break so dont think he's gonna do it any time soon\n\noh him coaching the Germany team would be so cool\n\nto be fair they all want a break until they actually have to be on a break for longer than a month\n\nüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ That man is not going to manage a National Team who just competed with his home country for a European Trophy. \n\nHe's not going to do anything to hamper the progress of the Spanish National Team, the way people think that can actually happen is hilarious.\n\nPep would fit England perfectly : \n- Stones , Walker , Foden and Grealish work with him at City \n- Other players he wanted for City also fit him like Rice and Bellingham \n- Then you have Arsenal english players who under Arteta are the same school as pep , so Saka , White , and more would be good \n- Also Pep would have many line ups program and not just a ‚Äúhard wire 4-2-3-1‚Äù , he would have 4-3-3 , 3-2-4-1 , and many more \n- He would fucking called Tomori and many great english players that Southgate did not called and wanted Luke Shaw instead who got smoke by a 17 year old who just turned that age lmao.\n\nIs there any opposition LB in the tournament that hasnt been smokef by that 17 yo ?\n\nPep, would be my choice, but alias I don't think he's interested at the moment.\n\nPep is Spanish though\n\nI bet the new one will suck\n\nOnly if the English limit themselves to English coaches.\n\n*Sven flashbacks* üíÄ\n\nTbf it‚Äôs more a matter if foreign coaches wanna even take the job. Like there‚Äôs several options but who‚Äôs to say they even want the job ? Not all the blame comes down to England yk lol\n\nTrue. I think the likes of Jurgen, Pep, Zizou and Ancelotti would only coach their respective NTs.\n\nLiterally. And I ain‚Äôt even mad that‚Äôs the case. I think if the roles were flipped we‚Äôd be mad if an English dude coached a foreign team. Not that we have any decent English coaches atm but hypothetically\n\nNot if it‚Äôs Klopp or Tuchel tbh (which I seriously doubt though).\n\n‚ÄúGareth Southgate steps down‚Äù\n\nWas he wearing a parachute just in case?\n\nlmfao\n\nTrent can finally have an international career now.\n\nThe best right back in the world and he‚Äôs sitting on the bench for that old man pace merchant who is the reason Spain scored two goals against England.\n\nHe gets a lot of credit based on England having a great talented crop of players, and based on the fact that we progressed well in multiple tournaments. \n\nBut really:\n- anyone else could‚Äôve done well with that crop of players. \n- England haven‚Äôt beaten a top ranked side since Denmark. \n- He single handedly lost us the previous Euro final with the hairbrained idea to sub on 3 untested youngsters in the final *just* for a penalty shootout, all of whom missed. \n\nEngland have been playing turdball 90% of the time for the last 6+ years, awful to watch, no vision. He‚Äôs more guilty than even past England managers of obviously bad squad and player selections based on name and playing for a big club rather than on form, fitness and fitting into a team.\n\n\"England haven‚Äôt beaten a top ranked side since Denmark.\"\n\n\nThey beat Netherlands last week????\n\nHistory might be kind to him, but he is really lucky that Bellingham scored that bycicle kick at the 96th minute. It really changed his legacy.\n\nFair play. He did the best anyone else has accomplished with an England squad since 1966. Hope he goes on to have a great career elsewhere. \n\nDoesn't matter if its a job for Brazil, Germany, England or any other nation. That particular managers role does not seem like an easy role by any means.\n\nBit late but the right decision. Should have been years ago but here we are.\n\nCredit for the changes he made initially and the improvements he made but he hit his ceiling early on and the team didn't.\n\nBe careful what you wish for.\n\nThanks god. All England matches were by far the worst matches on the Euro. France also kind of sucked, but man England was like trying 1 attempt per game. And this is coming from a Spaniard, can't imagine how a bri'ish may feel when his team is AFK 'til minute 93.\n\nGet Poch in please\n\nGraham Potter you are England new manager\n\nDamn, England might actually get a decent manager in and become good...\n\n...Stevie G and Fat Frank have entered the conversation, never mind!\n\nSees Cole Palmer and Alexander Arnold smiling and having a good time together. \n\n\"Not on my fucking team\"\n\nNot a tactical mastermind by any means, but made England fans proud to be England fans. 2 finals, 1 semi, 1 quarter. Whether you are ok with his tactics or not you can't deny they've worked and that he's probably the best England manager ever bar Alf Ramsey.\n\ndeleted\n\nI think people need to remember that in 2016, after the failures at the previous World Cup and the Euros, if you‚Äôd told people that over the next 8 years England would appear in two European Cup Finals and a World Cup Semi final they‚Äôd have looked at you very strangely. \n\nYes it‚Äôs clear that we do need a new manager to get the team over the top but the foundations for that have been well laid and the FA would be foolish not to include Southgate in some kind of official capacity and not make the mistake of jettisoning him like many other previous England managers.\n\n&gt; England would appear in two European Cup Finals\n\nI think if you'd told anyone that England would be in a European Cup Final they would have wondered why they were playing in a club competition in the past!\n\nKudos to Southgate. Most successful manager for England.\nI have one point for all those who think next manager will take them to promise land.What's the guarantee of this ? \nFor the last 24yrs I'm watching them , it always seems like manager is at fault. In the mean time I have seen their so-called golden generation fail to get past quarterfinal in all tournaments.\nLet's face facts english players live in their own dreamland supplemented by their media as best in the world. However fact is that it's due to high quality foreign players playing high quality football in EPL.\n\nIt's not that English players are bad however they are not that good as their media makes them out.\n\nP.S#Exceptions are always there.\n\nGREAT news.......!\n\nHe got unity back to the national team which was a huge problem in the past. Now we need the right appointment to take this team forward.\n\nAt long last\n\nCan‚Äôt understand the hate on him. Before Southgate, what have England done ? With the weakest generation modern England ever had, he reached 2 Euro finals and 1 WC quarter final. With Gerrard, Beckham, Lampard, Owen, Ferdinand, Ashley Cole, Neville, Carrick, what the previous coaches have achieved except disappointment ?\n\nGood decision, a bit late though.\n\nAw man, England might be good now.. bummer. They were fun to laugh at.\n\nThank God he left those ungrateful fans. He overachieved with the average players media and fans shoved on his throat as \"world class quality players\". Have fun struggling to get to a semifinal like before him.\n\nPleb gate\n\nwho the favorite to succeed Southgate as England manager?\n\nThink it was time. Getting to the late stages of tournaments flatter Southgate's general style of play- too defensive and slow for a crop of players used to playing high pressing fast attacking football at club level, but that's an issue that has plagued England for decades, attacking players set up by a defensive manager. This tournament really highlighted just how stifling his tactics were, with players like Bellingham, Foden, Kane, all of whom have had fantastic seasons, really struggling to make an impact.\n\nSo many top english names shagging him no wonder he quit\n\nLet‚Äôs see what yes man the FA get in next‚Ä¶\n\nWe are gonna win everything\n\nIt‚Äôs weird to say but he‚Äôs been good just not good enough to win trophies. But it‚Äôs been a solid run, gonna miss the Southgate banter üôå\n\nsad for him but good bye\n\nGood choice. Why would he want to deal with the idiotic English fans again where it‚Äôs championship or complete failure in any tournament? Where else is that true, instead of a strong tournament showing being considered very positive?\n\nIf you win something, you can get away with playing the most negative boring shite in the world.\n\nIf you don't end up winning something, you don't get away with it, if you are going to lose anyway, then people would rather at least have some entertainment.\n\nNow I will miss the FarleyTV skits.\n\nKlopp next?\n\nBad for other europe countries.\n\nMoyes in /s\n\nFully expect Potter for this. There's a reason he's been turning down jobs.\n\nBoth Southgate and Berhalter gone. What a time to be alive.\n\nGareth is like a guy with a Porsche who only ever drive 5 miles an hour under the speed limit. Sure he‚Äôll get you there but it could have been so much more.\n\nThe younger English fans are delusional to be welcoming this news. Even with the golden generation of gerrard, lampard Rooney etc England were incapable of playing good football before Gareth. Now you‚Äôre going to have Graham potter most likely as the first in a 2 decade long merry go round of mediocre managers, and just like pre-Gareth, you will never get past the quarter finals. That is the English way- Southgate was the exception, not the rule.\n\nThank fuck\n\nThe man wasted one of the most talented squads we had. \n\nHis \"success\" was being carried by players and not his coaching\n\nTo be fair Gareth I‚Äôve been quite critical of you but I respect your decision to leave on your own accord. You tried what you thought was right and played your way I wish you the best for the future and also hope England has a good future too.\n\nNeil Warnock\n\nGood for the rest of the world. First manager to take England to two Euro finals in a row and a World Cup semifinal on a top of that. Last time England got past the second stage of a major tournament was in 2006 and that's probably where they'll end up again\n\nThe War on Terrorism has ended...\n\nGood but not quite there kinda manager. Best wishes to him though\n\nHe made his choice not FA.\n\nIt is too much of him\n\nlets gooooo\n\nFinally good things to happen for England\n\nI think the writing was on the wall when he responded to criticism of his style with \"it's a result business\". If that's your mantra then you need to deliver a trophy unfortunately.\n\nIt's a shame it had to end like this because he's given me the best memories I've ever had as an England fan and I'm sure a lot of fans will always been thankful for that. But ultimately he probably underperformed with the talent at his disposal; certainly at this tournament, at least.\n\nDo hope he finds success in whatever his next move is as he seems like a great bloke who obviously gained the respect of most people he worked with.\n\nCheers Gareth.\n\nEnd on a high üòä\n\nIt‚Äôs two tournaments too late. He should have been sacked after the tactical disaster class against Italy. \n\nAs has been said, he has been very fortunate with the draws to get to the semis/finals whilst playing some absolutely abysmal football. This England squad was the strongest in the tournament by far and massively underperformed.\n\nThere are very limited homegrown options available so it will be an interesting appointment. Unfortunately, I don‚Äôt trust the FA to get it right.\n\nYou mentioned:\n- GS being a tactical disaster \n- limited homegrown options \n- FA not getting it right \n\nWhat‚Äôs left then? Another Sven or Capello?\n\nHe's coming home, I guess.\n\nThis guy could have won back to back euros\n\nIt was time, his record speaks for itself (still shoulda won 2020!).\n\nMourinho is what england needs\n\nHe can handle the media\n\nCan play tactics and mind games\n\nAnd he can motivate players\n\nBut the negativity would be deafening\n\nEngland has had the easiest euro run in two euros to get to the finals\n\nFirst world class team they played was Spain and it was extremely one sided\n\nItaly weren‚Äôt great in the last euros and just passed Spain on pens. Even giving England a one nil head start they comfortably played England off rh park and it was a poor Italy\n\nEngland has foden Bellingham saka taa and a few other generational talents who would get in 19/20 teams in most leagues yet they play like relegation fodder \n\nSurviving the game\n\nI think he was going to leave regardless if we won or not. It seemed like he made up his mind before the tournament that it would be his last. Maybe he just wants a break. Tough being England manager for 8 years honestly\n\nAbout time\n\nGareth has shaped and remodeled the team into something likeable and without the toxicity of the Rio/Gerrard/Terry years. Hopefully this is the foundation from which England‚Äôs success can be built on.\n\nDisgusting how it's the same people offering him sympathies after totally denigrating and humiliating the man who took you to back to back Euro finals.\n\nUnless y'all get Klopp I don't like this move.  Really thought england could have won the final if Harry Kane wasn't playing deep all game.\n\nThank God. He spoiled the best team in the world in the euros. They have A superstar in every position and still managed to bottle the title. The fact that they got to the final was just because of individual brilliance\n\nSouthgate rejected the renewal as the manager contract from FA.\n\nfarewell gareth \"safety first\" southgate\n\nbro was the sub teacher that ended up staying for like 3 months.\n\nHe did well, and deserves the commendations. Thank you, Gareth.\n\nHe‚Äôll go down as 1 of the best. Thank you Gareth Southgate\n\nCan‚Äôt wait until England is bounced from the 26 cup in the group stage.\n\nHe's let us down badly in two finals with poor tactics and the wrong starting line ups. He had a great squad and they misfired most of the tournament and it felt like they had handbrake on. I think we will live to regret not picking a trophy in the last two finals.\n\nNeeds to be an English person, we can't have a German or Argentine in charge of England\n\nEnglish coaches don't win trophies.\n\nThis is amazing news. Not necesarily a bad coach but they played such boring football under him.\n\nWhat a perfect time to go.\n\nNew manager wins World Cup media will say Southgate lined it up for them.\n\nNew manger fails and the media will crow about how Southgate was hounded out of the job and we didn't know we had it so good.\n\nOnce again Southgate can't lose, honestly believe if this guy played the lottery he'd pick 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, as his numbers and win the jackpot.\n\nYEEEEESSSSSSSS HAPPY SOUTHGATE LEAVING DAY."

You're vastly overestimating how much those children are paid.\n\nwho said anything about the children? the factory needs ppl cracking the whips and bribing the authorities\n\nSorry my humble apologies\n\nNah, sticking on the badges of a generic designed shirt hikes the price up 3x\n\nhttps://youtu.be/CU6HDaVRjtI?si=Kihtuf86_3aaeBj0\n\nThis might help\n\n¬£85 for the replica version, the genuine ‚ÄòDri Fit‚Äô is ¬£125 for adult men‚Äôs. 50% more expensive than they were for the 2018 World Cup shirts.\n\nAlternatively play their capitalist game and get a cheaper identikit for a score. It's just capitalism afterall\n\nIf you‚Äôre paying for the ‚Äòdri fit‚Äô then you deserve to be parted from your money.\n\nCompletely unnecessary\n\nWell they completely sold out of the dri fit away shirt in every single size at every retailer within a few days of release, unlike the replica which is still available in most sizes. So looks like pretty much everyone buying an official shirt disagree with you lol.\n\nThey also carry much lower stock because the demand is much lower.\n\n\nFrankly, I've got a couple of 'authentic' shirts and it's a waste of money. They're much less durable than the fan version\n\nDHGate ¬£12 for the player fit jerseys. Will never spend ¬£80 on a jersey again. Price gouging at its finest.\n\nEvery kit I‚Äôve bought there has peeled after a few washes\n\nThe factories aren't heat sealing the Iron on transfers properly. That's why they come off. Re-iron it at home when you receive it.¬†\n\n\nPut greaseproof/ parchment paper over the letters/numbers and then put a towel / cloth over the parchment. Iron on a medium/high heat and apply lots of pressure as you go.¬†\n\n\nMy kid is running around in a 2020 Sterling shirt, where the name has only just started to crack up from washing.¬†\n\nI‚Äôve heard that but I‚Äôve bought 3 shirts a season for the last 4 seasons and they‚Äôre all still perfect. Guess I‚Äôve been lucky, but my mates has peeled so I‚Äôm not doubting you.\n\nEdit: even if it did peel, I‚Äôd still rather pay the ¬£12 than full price for a legit kit.\n\nJust FYI they make hundreds of times the amounts of the replica compared to the ‚Äòdri fit‚Äô\n\nSo no, unless you have actual numbers, I don‚Äôt think ‚Äòpretty much everyone‚Äô disagrees.\n\nI would bet huge amounts of money that the replica has sold loads more than the extra rip off version.\n\n125 for a piece of plastic\n\nThey used to $60 for 2006 FIFA World Cup.\n\nYup. I'm with the England fans for once. Stop fleecing fans. Simple. 80 quid for a shirt that probably cost a 5er in material and labour.\n\nNow if they promised to pay the worker fairly for the 80 quid shirt I'd think twice. But they won't. So I'll go direct to the source and pay a Chinese vendor 20 quid\n\nIt's the clubs, players, and Nike all not being willing to take a hit on their share of the profits. \n\nIt would still be profitable, they are just greedy and people will pay it. Most big clubs sell out their stock by the end of the year.\n\nThe only thing that would solve this is government regulation. People will say that is overkill, but they already cap prices on all kinds of things. Football shirts just aren't a priority for them.\n\nI also think it's a stupid price, but it's a completely voluntary purchase. It's not comparable to food or medicine or something.¬†\n\n&gt;Football shirts just aren't a priority for them.\n\nYou say that only a few weeks after both Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer felt the need to complain about the colour of the cross on the back of an England shirt...\n\n&gt; It's the clubs, players, and Nike\n\nAnd the people who can't simply not buy a shirt while still supporting their team.\n\n&gt; Football shirts just aren't a priority for them.\n\nI'd be pissed at my government if they were.\n\nI just checked, and the Polish one costs... 135 quid. 80 quid seems reasonable in comparison ;-)\n\nExactly. Fucking greedy fuckers getting exactly what they deserve for designing a fucking standard looking t-shirt then trying to flog it for the same price of a days work. Go fuck yourself Nike‚Ä¶.\n\nF me. Bought an official Adidas football kit and 6 years in the sponsor logo is gone since it wasn't fucking stitched and just pressed.\n\nThey shouldn‚Äôt price the kits at ridiculous prices. Just seems to go up and up at each tournament.\n\nNike shirts are such a fucking scam. For Liverpool, they make some of our worst kits and then charge over ¬£100 for them. It's ridiculous.\n\nOur home kit for next year is so bad and basically universally reviled.\n\nI finally saw it in public a couple weeks ago, it‚Äôs even worse in person\n\nI just don't get why they can't design a damn shirt collar. It feels like since we're leaving them for Adidas they just half assed it.\n\nGod am I happy we switched to adidas.\n\nOoft, just looked it up. Horrendous\n\nI get them from DHGate now.\n\nGot me and my wife one, hers had a name on the back, Prem patch on the arm.  Printing is still absolutely fine on it 6 months later.\n\n¬£30 for both with delivery.\n\nAdidas secured the contract with Arsenal and started making their logo bigger than the teams it‚Äôs lunacy.\n\nThe club are worse to allow than. Puma got massive backlash for it previously.\n\nFans should also boycott the jersey in cases like that\n\nWtf 100¬£? \n\nI have several 10-15¬£ counterfeit jerseys that are still intact after 5-7 years lol. Imagine spending this much on a tee that you will hardly wear 20 times a year.\n\nI just checked the store and there's two jerseys. The stadium jersey is ¬£80 and the match jersey is fucking ¬£125. Even the ¬£80 is a fucking scam for a jersey it can't cost more than ¬£20 to make. Some sources I've seen put it as low as ¬£8.\n\nI'm surprised it costs then ¬£8 to make to be honest\n\nVisited old Trafford for a game and was planning to buy shirts for my dad and brothers.\n\nTossed that idea out the window when I discovered it was around 70-80 (couldn't recall exactly) a pop\n\nKits, jerseys, whatever people want to call them, they are simply overpriced and not good value for money.\n\nI always wait for end of season sales, Black Friday, etc. üòâ\n\njust buy older season second hand. They are at most 40 quid and also hold a lot of nostalgia, for the most part i only own kits from 5-10 years ago\n\nQuality goes down, prices go up. They get mad when their profits crash\n\nIndeed. Happy to just wear my Euro 2020 England shirt tbh.\n\nThey always take advantage of tournaments to increase prices.\n\nDoes anyone know where I can buy a fake\n\nMy mate swears by dhgate\n\nThey're good and last long if you take care with washing them and can ignore the fact they're made by children in sweatshops\n\nLike the Nike ones are not lol\n\nseriously some of the products sold on those Chinese websites are the exact same product. factory owner keeps the factory running after hours and skims product to resell himself. it's all the companies' fault for producing in countries like that.\n\nYeah fair shout. I can‚Äôt imagine the actual england kits are made in much better conditions. They are identical in design so rumour is they are made in the same factory as the offical ones‚Ä¶ but i‚Äôm not sure thats true\n\nI have fakes from Dhgate and real kits from club shops, and unless someone is going to inspect every detail up close, they‚Äôre practically identical. Stitching can be a bit off on the fakes but again no one cares or gives a flying f‚Äî-\n\nSo are the real ones. Only worry really is the lack of regulation for things like fire retardation or dangerous chemicals. Not saying they're dangerous, but they're not checked and made by people who will suffer no consequences if there is something wrong with it.\n\nI got a full England kit from onbuy.com for my kid for ¬£12 with delivery. So glad I did as he'd spilled a lot of mustard and ketchup on it within half an hour of putting it on.\n\nr/jjsport\n\nr/soccer00\n\nLike 5+ football-related posts on Instagram and your next 30 adverts will be for counterfeit England shirts\n\nUusoccer @ .ru instead of @ .com\n\nIs delivery reliable? Like is it not a scam\n\nLoads on eBay. Quality is fine for ¬£25/30\n\nCheers mate\n\nAlso search DHGate thats also a good one\n\nI order kits for my full team every season! I‚Äôve spent thousands with them. Quality is mid but that‚Äôs what you get for $15 USD. Wash the kits on cold inside out! Better than Dhgate, I‚Äôve never tried ebay\n\nhttps://m.shootjerseys.vip\n\nGo for the ‚ÄòThai Version‚Äô kits. Also, order a size up.\n\nIstanbul\n\nYeah DHgate\n\nPeterbot.top has been solid for me\n\nDhgate is where I get vintage looking shirts. Got a brilliant cantona one there for cheap\n\nSoutheast Asia. I see tons of Brits flying over there and buying nice jerseys.\n\nThey didn‚Äôt lose 2.5 million due to counterfeiting, if people are buying counterfeit it‚Äôs because they weren‚Äôt gonna spend ¬£100 on a shirt (good for them) so Nike didn‚Äôt lose any money by people paying someone else for a fake\n\nWon‚Äôt SOMEBODY think of the corporations?!\n\nAnd the shareholders? üò±\n\nGood, fuck Nike\n\nI am kind of jealous of Germany when I see them in an Adidas kit. I would love to see England stick to Umbro (even if they do have American overlords) or even Admiral!!\n\nGermany is moving to nike\n\nOld skool Kappa would be awesome\n\nI always like how Denmark have Hummel too. A switch to Admiral would be pretty cool. It would be nice if we had a British based company making the kits and they make some pretty nice looking stuff these days too.\n\nSuch a shame Castore is so shit. Umbro is a shout though.\n\numbro are british again now aren't they? the only reason england moved to nike in the first place is because they consumed all the umbro contracts before they sold off the brand\n\nThey look exactly the same so why wouldn't people buy them instead of paying ¬£80?\n\nOh, no. Corporate overlords lose out on 0.01% on their yearly salary. Fucking end me\n\nPrice things better then. People are finally discovering that you can just buy something made in the same place, of the same quality, for an eighth of the price.\n\nThey shouldn‚Äôt cost as much as they do. Shoukd cost like ¬£20\n\nTo be fair I'd be tempted at about ¬£50, but I'm not spending ¬£80 on a football shirt. Probably an instant buy if I liked the shirt and it was 40 quid.\n\nThat‚Äôs a bit generous\n\nIt shouldn't be more than ¬£50 considering that it is just for a particular tournament.¬†\n\n$2.5m is not a massive loss for Nike when it's 2022 annual revenue was $51.2 billion.\n\nNot to mention that they didn't really lose $2.5M. They only lost revenue from customers who would have bought the real thing if there was no counterfeit.\n\nThe other thing is, even if there were no counterfeit options at all, those people largely still wouldn‚Äôt buy the shirt anyway because it‚Äôs still too expensive.\n\nLol good.\n\nHow will they manage?\n\nPeasants not having $170 lying around under the cushion /s\n\nIf it really had an impact on them then they would lower the costs to compete with the counterfeiters. They won‚Äôt cause it‚Äôs not impacting them.\n\nstop charging 80 quid a pop then\n\n¬£125 if you want the players one. Mental.\n\nWant a player on the back and sleeve patches and probably more like ¬£150. Daft\n\nThe cost of original jersey is so high, I‚Äôd better pay 1/3 of it to get a first copy.\n\nI dont think they would face any loss (but more profits) if they would sell for a reasonable price.\n\nI see no problem here\n\nThe shirts are shit lol, home one looks basic and plain, and the away one is some purpl/blue monstrosity that doesn‚Äôt even have a single colour from the england flag, the gold lions look good I‚Äôll give it that. But it really isn‚Äôt even worth wearing a fake one let alone a real one lol\n\nThen stop pricing out fans. \n\nEspecially on kits since its not like stadium tickets. the supply is not limited, they Can easily produce more but are just greedy.\n\nThey charge ¬£210 for a pair of shoes made by a child. \n\nThey can fuck right off.\n\nGoing to get mine from dodgy Dave shortly. He doesn‚Äôt take dollars though lol\n\nThat's what happens when you wanna charge $150 on a sh\\*tty made jersey that doesn't last more than 2 years average. Pretty sure it ain't just England. Pretty sure it ain't just national selections nor just big clubs.\n\nPoor Nike - absolutely fucking no one\n\nI feel so bad for their executives relying on that bonus for their 2nd yacht\n\nGood. Fuck Nike and the whole lot.\n\nYes more power to them. I haven't bought an \"official kit\" since 2021. I used to get them the next year when they went on discounts but nowadays those discounts are not even that great.\n\nOh no, how is the CEO going to pay their bills this month?\n\nThis is awful, anyway, where could one buy one of these fakes?\n\nSame\n\nWow 2.5 mil, im sure these indie companies will face massive revenue lost\n\nWait till they see La Pulga\n\nIs 2.5 million really that big of a deal to Nike?\n\nThat is 25k shirts not sold by Nike. Something tells me there still would be some revenue loss if there were none of the counterfeits. Not everyone can afford $150 for authentic shirt, $100 for the replica, $80 for junior and $65 for todlers shirts. No wonder people go for something that is 20% of the original price.\n\nHow much do you guys think the shirt should be ?\n\n¬£40? Still a very reasonable mark up. It‚Äôs not as if they‚Äôre paying the factory staff top whack.\n\nTrue , true  it‚Äôs a tough one because, you could argue that if the shirts were cheaper then they‚Äôd sell more leading to more sales revenue\n\nWhen LFC decided to go with Nike I was like ffs no more shirts for me then unless I wait a year or something.\n\nLove to know where they got them because I am not paying 80 quid\n\nDamn now they have to make them even more expensive to make up for the loss\n\nOver priced kits, ‚Äòstadium kit‚Äô ‚Äòmatch kit‚Äô. Template kits too‚Ä¶ kit manufacturers are a joke nowadays.\n\nNever used to support buying counterfeit jerseys, but with these stupid prices now days I don't blame them. I've bought a couple recently. Quality is okay-ish. No one will find out. \n\nYou also save a shit ton so there's that.\n\nIf they were cheaper then sure, but with the fan version costing over $100, they can piss right off\n\n[I had to](https://i.imgflip.com/8t50k7.jpg)\n\nI'd buy more shirts if the fan versions didn't cost like 80$+ and if you want a match replica it's like 120-150 depending on badges and all kinds of other stuff. Soccer jerseys and jerseys in general tend to be ludicrously expensive...I'll take a decent knock-off for fractions of the price any day.\n\nThe fake ¬£25 ones are pretty much identical. Ridiculous mark up\n\nCheck24 FTW\n\n[Proper link](https://www.themirror.com/sport/soccer/england-fans-nike-soccer-shirt-525979) in case someone is looking for it.\n\nGet the go fund me started. A small family company like Nike will not survive at this rate\n\nWon't anybody think of the massive blood-sucking corporations?!\n\nI now get my kids kit from a ‚Äúdodgy bloke‚Äù in the pub. United want best part of ¬£100 for a kids strip. Get fucked. Cost like ¬£5 to make\n\nNike make the worst kits of all time.\n\nThe profit margin is absolutely insane while they exploit people with offshoring\n\nMy kids have counterfeit England shirts. Fuck paying ¬£60 each for a toddler and a primary school child to spill their breakfast down it.\n\n¬£11 each, including shorts and socks and name and number and sleeve patches? It‚Äôs a no-brainer.0\n\nI don‚Äôt know, but I struggle to feel bad for a multinational, multibillion corporation losing what for them is a measly 2.5M euros. Price your shirts fairly and reasonably if you don‚Äôt want people buying cheap fake ones.\n\nGreat\nFUCK nike!!!!\n\nBetter to not have a new jersey than spend 80 pounds on one, wouldn't sell without counterfeits either\n\nGood.\n\noh no!\n\nAren't the regular sheets cheaper than ¬£2.5 million?\n\nDisagree. People who want to spend exorbitant amounts for official jerseys which are often just as shitty in terms of quality as the knock-offs do. People who buy knock-offs would not spend that amount on official merchandise.¬†\n\nDo they really? Face massive loss? Would most of those ppl afford the legit stuff anyway?\n\nWon‚Äôt make it out of the group stage anyway\n\nThe away jersey looks pretty sick. But yeah overpriced.\n\nI still dont understand why they make the shirts so pricey. If they sold for half of the price, i think 5x the people will buy them.\n\nIm not spending 100 euros for a fucking football shirt\n\nIt‚Äôs not a loss because they would never have spent that much on a shirt anyway.\n\nPoor Nike, they should price their jersey replicas at $200 so we can all donate a bit for the company\n\nWon't somebody think of the multi-billion dollar sportswear conglomerate!!!\n\nI don't blame people for buying reps. The price for football shirts is getting out of hand.\n\nYes because those people are spending the bulk of their money, on food and bills.\n\nNot many people wanna spend close to ¬£100 on a football shirt. Hope Nike gets that message.\n\n¬£80+ for a child top. National or clubs. Vs ¬£10 fully customised that they grow out of in a couple of years.¬†¬†\n\n\nI remember the year Sports Direct sold England tops for ¬£11 before a tournament. Bought for nephews and more. At these prices, it's just too too much. ¬£20 max for kids. ¬£35 max for adults. Should be the price.¬†\n\nThey‚Äôre not losing revenue because those people would have never bought the original shirt anyway.\n\nOh no poor Nike üò¢\n\nNike charges way too much for those jerseys, so this is natural.\n\nAwww poor Nike.\n\n2.5 mil is massive for Nike ?\n\nIf Nike sold jerseys for $40 I‚Äôd buy. No more\n\nGood, fuck nike\n\n2.5 million is a drop in the bucket for them. Massive revenue loss very very over exaggerated.\n\nOh no!       \n       \nAnyway......\n\nMine will cost probably a tenner here in Malaysia, perfect for the 5 minutes the excitement of the English time in the Euro‚Äôs lasts (based on last nights Iceland game)\n\nGood\n\nthan maybe stop charging ¬£130 for a jersey you bloody buckets\n\nThe current acotland tops are going to be the lowest seller but most popular. Seen at least 4 different sellers on fb and about a dozen posts from people asking who's selling.\n\nTo buy the actual top it is ¬£75 so I don't blame people for buying knock offs.\n\nGood, less price gauging by the big corps and the fans may buy the real thing.\n\nMaybe dont price it at ¬£80 for a shirt most people will only wear for 2-3 weeks during the tournament.\n\nI bought arsenal kit from Adidas last year as I was going to wear it all season, and was willing to pay rrp.\n\nFor an england kit IL wear 3-6 times im going to dhgate.\n\nOhhhh nooooo!!!! Not nike losing money ?!?! What a disgrace!\n\nLove it.\n\nSimply put a fan version should be ‚Ç¨50 no more no less it was like that i feel 10-15 years ago and besides the Turkey vacation goers not a whole Lot of people where buying fakes but now one look at the price and i am on Ali express looking at fake shirts\n\nFuck them rich people stop buying shitt from 0 pleasd\n\nGood\n\nI paid 70 euros for nike jersey, and it's worse quality than one from Aliexpress. Like you are wearing a plastic bag lol fucking scammers\n\ni doubt $2.5m means anything to nike\n\nMost of these ‚Äúcounterfeit‚Äù shirts are just ones that were a single stitch out of place, meaning Nike won‚Äôt sell them. And we can buy them for ¬£10 from ‚Äòdodgy‚Äô sites. Even if Nike sold them at ¬£10 they‚Äôd scape a profit. Prices of football stuff has gone through the roof and I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs taken this for companies like Nike to realise we‚Äôre not gonna roll over and spend whatever they want to charge. Fuck em\n\n100 quid for the sponsors logos and player number to get washed off and then the kit looks like shit. No thanks.\n\nI remember being in UK ahead of World Cup 06 and buying Umbro kits of half the squad. They were maybe ¬£15 each? Shame\n\noh deary me how is one of the richest companies ever going to deal with 2,5m.... no bonus for the CEO this year guys then you can definitely survive  4 more tournaments..\n\nFuck off Nike, you don't even deserve that money\n\nMinejersey for the win\n\nI brought a long sleeve 1998 Man U jersey off Shoppee for ¬£13.50, it was the same one I had as a kid.  I didn‚Äôt feel bad, cos at the time Chistiano Ronaldo were in their fucking ads while playing at Man U.  So I just assumed he would have made way more money from Shoppee, than he would have from me buying a retro jersey directly.  \nAlso fyi, the Shoppee jersey was legit.  Same material, zipper was identical, raised umbro logo, embroidery was spot on, I could tell the difference, for ¬£13.50\n\nNice of Nike to assume that people that buy ‚Ç¨15 Players version Shirt would've bought a ‚Ç¨150 and count it as loss of revenue.\n\nOh No! Anyway...\n\nhttps://www.thefootballshirtstore.com\n\nThis kind of shit makes my blood boil, Most people won't pay 80 euro's for a shirt. And calling people not buying their product (that they wouldn't have brought anyway) a massive revenue loss is pathetic. (\"You took my only food and now I'm gonna starve\" -Patrick Star)\n\n Massive revenue loss = the cost of a family guy episode. Lol\n\nLike the jersey is so expensive¬†\n\nPeople are tired of being ripped off. I say good on them\n\nWhy would I spend 80 euros, while a 30 euro replica, is exactly the same quality?\n\nWhen will they ever learn? It's not revenue loss if it's money that they never would have received anyway. No-one spending money on a counterfeit would have spent 100 quid on the real thing\n\nlol fuck Nike. It‚Äôs ridiculous the prices they charge for a shirt that gets made for a tiny fraction of the selling price. That‚Äôs what greed gets you.\n\nCurious how they can measure people spending money on non authentic apparel?\n\nWell done England fans üëèüèª\n\n$200aud a kit might have something to do it..\n\nStill wearing the World Cup away shirt i got in Thailand for ¬£11"

    "all_comment_text": "P√©p√© in the squad as well holy\n\nAt 41 years old! Jeez\n\nHe‚Äôs still an animal\n\nPepe honestly deserves to be nominated. He played a decent season in the league and was one of the best Porto players in the Champions League.\n\nDoes he still commit terrorist attacks against other players and getting away with it?\n\nI hope so, yes\n\nYes he does\n\nBut still has fewer Euros than CR? Did he miss some through injury?\n\nHe was not Portuguese in 2004\n\nMisread your comment as Pel√© for a second and got very confused\n\nThe fact that this guy was a starter in the 2004 tournament and is gonna be a starter against in the 2024 tournament is absolutely insane. Many players don't even get a 20+ year old long career, let alone on that level.\n\nI just don't think Ronaldo wants to give up, young at heart\n\nRonaldo is one of the most passionate and disciplined athletes in football history. He wants to keep competing and will play for 100 years if he could. Mourinho mentioned Ronaldo was the player most interested in football he's ever coached.\n\nNot just in football, easily one of the most disciplined and passionate athletes across all sports.\n\nI remember a story about when he came to man utd that rio gave him a couple of weeks to settle in then went round to his house and was shocked by the number of people in his but then he said nutrition guy...that's my chef...that's my English teacher...that's my personal trainer\n\nMy favourite story is how he got destroyed by his teammates in table tennis, then played them again weeks later and wiped the floor with them\n\nThe Evra story too, where he invited him for lunch after training and Evra says there was only water and plain white chicken, and he wanted to train even more just after eating. Cracks me up every time\n\nHe actually said he didn't want to go to Ronaldo house never again to dinner, it cracks me up every time xD\n\nMaybe he‚Äôll even make it to the 2026 World Cup then?\n\nDefinitely. I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôll want to be on the pitch if Portugal wins.\n\nHe will be arrested first thing he lands in the US bro üò≠\n\nPretty sure it's why he's had the plastic surgery as well, he just doesn't want to be old\n\nPeople here really overplay this. He doesn't look like he got plastic surgery, just thinner and older.\n\nI mean, if you look at him at 19 and now.. its hard to say he didnt have surgery no?\n\nSorry, yes. He definitely had work done early on, like fixing his teeth. But he's been the same for like 15 years.\n\nHe‚Äôs definitely had a whole new set of teeth put in along with Botox to his face\n\nHe clearly as Botox or something that removes wrinkles all over his face, especially on the forehead.\n\nAlso I would guess he did the surgery where you cut skin from the hairline or the back of the ears so the skin on the face looks tighter.\n\nAlso did his nose and has a full set of new teeth. \n\nHe did a good job in making it look natural but he definitely had a lot of work done to his face.\n\nhe's had a lot more than just the teeth, and it's been ongoing https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNP2MmFaG4c\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNP2MmFaG4c\n\nA literal plastic surgeon giving his expert opinion on him and his surgeries, he does plenty of other celebrities.\n\nOr that he's a narcissist.\n\ntbf, many people who play at his level for so long in any sport have to be a tad narcissistic\n\nWait he got plastic surgery? Completely out of the loop on this one.\n\nHis fitness is still way better than many 28 year old players.\n\nMan, 2004 was 20 years ago? I can still remember watching the Greeks pull off that coup..\n\nWe don't talk about that game\n\nMost players don't have a cult of personality. Ronadlo can't run, won't get back, won't defend and will throw a touchline tauntrum if he doens't play the full 90 minutes. At this point he is probably a burden for them.\n\nAnd still probably be up there amongst the top scorers of the tournament.¬†\n\nI don‚Äôt know Portugal‚Äôs tactic and if the way he plays will be overly detrimental (e.g if they‚Äôre a pressing side), but at the end of the day, goals win games.¬†\n\nYou're delusional if you think he'll score a single goal that is not a penalty. He should only take minutes after 70-80th minute if they're leading comfortably.\n\n[deleted]\n\nTop scorer eh? Yep, 0 goals like I said, it was obvious that he was beyond finished, couldnt even do anything even though his whole team tried to feed him relentlessly.\n\n[deleted]\n\nHahahah keep crying mate, easy üòÇ\n\nehehe Ronaldo hooked up with your sister?   \nset a reminder for in 3 weeks and then we'll talk.\n\n!reminder 3 weeks\n\nHey how's it going hahahah\n\nMiserably lol\n\n&gt;at the end of the day, goals win games\n\nYeah, and it goes both ways. A team could get outscored by not working hard enough out of possession.\n\nTrue but it all comes down to tactics.\n\nPlenty of managers are more than happy to have the other 10 players be the water carriers for one player as long as he's a baller. I mean, most players are happy to work like dogs if they know their mate will win the game for them.\n\nBTW - I also don't see why this criticism is only levelled at Ronaldo. Messi is famous for literally *walking* around the pitch for half the game.\n\nWhat are you talking about? This criticism is absolutely leveled at Messi.\n\nEven in Barcelona, people were talking about how he didn‚Äôt defend, and then in PSG this talk amplified because he was in a frontline trio who all refused to defend. In the last World Cup, Argentina did well to realise Messi was a defensive burden and made up for it with more hard working players.\n\nWas he not one of the top goalscorers in euro qualifiers?\n\nBoth can be true?\n\n- One of the top goalscorers\n- A burden\n\nPick one\n\nSpoken like someone who has never played the game. Cherry pickers and ball hogs can often shine if you just look at goals scored. But they hurt the overall team and teammates. \n\nRonaldo is still class and one of the best to ever do it. So he‚Äôs going to score when he plays. \n\nBut if everyone‚Äôs burdened with more defending, more pressing, more offensive runs to make up for his lack of work then‚Ä¶.\n\nWorth mentioning that he‚Äôs the leading goal scorer for Portugal in the group stages with 10 goals, 3 against Liechtenstein, 2 against Luxembourg, 1 against Iceland. \n\nThough the more impressive ones were 2 each against Slovakia and Bosnia.\n\n&gt;Cherry pickers and ball hogs can often shine if you just look at goals scored\n\nYes sir. Same way Haaland broke the EPL scoring record, but City ended up scoring fewer goals than the season before. This season Haaland scored 9 goals fewer, yet City as a whole scored 2 more than last season.\n\nI wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs impressive to score 2 against Bosnia. We are and have been consistently shit for almost 10 years.\n\nNot impressive, just more impressive than basically city states like Luxembourg\n\nNeymar, Messi, and Mbappe would say you don't have to pick one.\n\nAs Roy Keane said specifically about this, never had a problem with a striker that scores... It's the rest of the team that has a problem.\n\nHe still is the best Portuguese player on his position though. Unless you'd rather start a bench player in Ligue 1 that was the worst player on the pitch on every UCL game he played this season. Or other terrible options like Andre Silva, Felix, Guedes etc.\n\nDon't know why Martinez won't go for Ramos and Ronaldo with Bruno in behind.\n\nBruno has been quality in a shit Man Utd team.\n\nThat would require one of Bernardo/Leao to be benched though, which isn't ideal. They're special players and can offer much more than Ramos does.\n\nI think the best case scenario would be an attack of Leao - Ronaldo - Bernardo, with Bruno as a CM/AM behind them and two DMs, Pahlinha and Vitinha (more advanced DM of the 2). They just possess too much offensive talent to be fielding 2-3 defensive mids (Carvalho, Danilo, Neves) like Santos did in the past.\n\nAlso personally I'd start Nuno Mendes over Cancelo/Guerreiro. The guy is a gem and was probably PSG's best player in the UCL knockouts, after returning from a year long injury.\n\nMendes or Guerreiro are ahead of Cancelo. Cancelo has been dire recently.\n\nI'd bench Leao. Leao hasn't cut it as a starter and can offer more when legs tire. I'd go with Bernado and Bruno.\n\nAnd yeah, I will vomit if Portugal use to holding DMs again after Santos has left.\n\nAgree 100 percent\n\nWhat's the goal ratio of that lousy sub player?\n\nDiogo Jota I would argue has been one of the best centre forwards when fit, if not the best.\n\nYou're correct but Felix isn't a terrible option though\n\nFelix is beyond terrible. He has 1-2 good games (Ghana &amp; Switzerland 2022 for Portugal, Betis and Antwerp for Barcelona) and then completely disappears. It's no coincidence that he never starts for Barca anymore and that he flopped at Atleti, Barcelona and Chelsea.\n\nHe's a centre forward. Who cares if he doesnt track back and defend? Ronaldo is still Portugal's best goal scoring player.\n\nI don't agree with this. The football they play with Martinez suits Ronaldo waaaaay more than the one they played with Santos. They are playing attacking football and he gets fed a lot of chances. It wasn't an accident that he was the qualifier's top scorer.\n\nfair enough\n\n&gt;At this point he is probably a burden for them.\n\nHe was a burden for them in the 2022 world cup as well. It isn't recent.\n\nPeople act like Ronaldo and Messi were on the same level on that world cup is insane. Ronaldo was kneecaping that team\n\nThis isn‚Äôt true though is it? Come on\n\nWhile the tantrum thing is ridiculous, probably, it‚Äôs true he won‚Äôt go back. Or can‚Äôt.\n\nI am not one of these Ronaldo super fans- but I still think the guy absolutely has a role to play at this level. I don‚Äôt question his work rate or application either. I do think he should be used more sparingly, but he is still a game changing player imo\n\nDon‚Äôt disagree with that. My point is he‚Äôs just too old unfortunately \n\nHe could be a GREAT late game player for Portugal, but starting him and effectively leaving a 10v11 early in the game is just way too risky for me\n\nWhat went wrong at Man U? Maybe there's a reason he's not playing in a serious league.\n\nHe's 39 years old. It's time for the world to move on.\n\nHe scored 19 goals in 40 games. Not too shabby\n\nHe‚Äôs not gonna be a starter, I‚Äôd be very surprised (and disappointed) if he is. He just doesn‚Äôt have it in him anymore and there are better options.\n\nUnfortunately he will be a starter\n\nEven though I liked him as player, I‚Äôll be very disappointed if he starts for my country if the games aren‚Äôt against Liechtenstein or Andorra\n\nhe's starting games?\n\nHe has been Portugal's starting striker ever since Martinez became the coach.\n\nronaldo sure does know how to stir up reddit users considering the amount of replies on this 1 comment\n\nMost player don‚Äôt even get a 15+ year old career\n\nHim and Lothar Matth√§us are the only two that I can think of that have appeared in tournaments, twenty years apart\n\nIts crazy how clear Ronaldo is of any other footballer not named Messi. Any other era and he is the greatest player ever. Cant wait, probably be his last big international tournament.\n\nMy man will probably still be a sub for us on 26. Wouldn't put it past him\n\nRonaldo will never accept not being able to play the full 90 mins, you know what happened with United right. Either you play him full time or you don't\n\nIt's a stretch maybe, but I think he'll go for WC26. It's possible and if anyone can do it then it's him. Maybe with 43 y.o. Pepe as well xD\n\nThese comments will age like milk\n\nHalf of them sure, we‚Äôll see how it goes\n\nThis sub is a CR7 haters paradise\n\nI thought that‚Äôs r/soccercirclejerk\n\nplenty here too,\n\nI will accept being proved wrong. However, Ronaldo has not been great for Portugal in these years; many Portuguese fans say the team plays better without him and I would agree. We'll see how Euros go very soon.\n\nPortuguese here - I agree that we play better without him, and that's been the case for a good few years\n\nWell you did play without him against Morocco.\n\nWent pretty well.\n\nYou did well in casually skipping over the fact we also didn't start Ronaldo in the Switzerland game we won 6-1 :) he only got subbed in at the 70' mark after Ramos scored his hat trick \n\nAnd yeah Ronaldo surely would've won us the game we were getting completely outplayed in the midfield and couldn't get any balls up to the later third of the field!\n\nYou dare to question the form of Saudi league top scorer?!! Lol.\n\nAged pretty well, he's been shite\n\nPlayed alright for the most part, portugal just does not have the mentality required to progress. They don't know how to finish the game and their fraud manager doesn't help their case either\n\nHe missed so many sitters, though, and you can't argue that his behaviour hasn't been short of embarrassing. I agree the manager clearly is shite, as Ronaldo shouldn't be starting.\n\nLooking forward to one last big stage tournament for CR7, lets gooooo\n\nLast?\n\nI highly doubt he will play World Cup. There's a video of his wife saying that he said to her he only has 1 or 2 years before he retires, and in two years who knows if he will be as good as he is now (especially if he somehow win Euros he can leave international football on a good note carrying portugal to two euros instead of losing in QF on WC again and made fun of compared to messi)\n\nKnowing Ronaldo, he will want to play one last world cup though\n\nI agree. We talked last week and he told me the same thing.\n\ntf you on abt he told me he'll play in 2070 WC?\n\nYo guys it's me Ronaldo, I can confirm I want to play one last world.\n\nAs a Messi fan. Nothing will ever make me hate Ronaldo.\n\nNo way football fans with a brain exist???\n\nThats not a very clever statement. Imagine the guy kill someone\n\nIkr \"Las Vegas 2009\" &amp; \"London Hotel 2005\" were my favourite Ronaldo moments üí™üíØ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nAnd so began the r/soccercirclejerk portion of this thread\n\nWhat do you gain from this?\n\nwow top 10 football respect moment\n\nOmg how big of you üëèüëèüëèüëèüëè And a messi fan? God those are rare!\n\nFr, people treat Messi and Ronaldo as an either/or and think if they like or prefer one they cannot be seen associated or speaking about the other\n\nMost of these Messi and Ronaldo diehards are in their teen years now so when both retire and the dust truly settles in a few decades potentially, they'll either realise the error of their tribalistic ways or end up looking foolish\n\nWhat about the 100s of thousands of dollars he paid in hush money to a women who accused him of rape? He also paid his baby mama of his first kid to disappear.¬†\n\nI mean, if I could pay a days wage to not have to go through a rape trial even if I was innocent I would too\n\nIdk, rape is a pretty serious crime. If he was truly innocent, he could probably have paid half that money to lawyers to nip that in the butt.\n\nWho knows, trials are expensive and take a lot of time and energy. Either was he was never convicted of it.\n\nNeither was Donald Trump when he was accused of raping a 13 year old along side none other then the greatest pedo of all, Jeffery Epstein. CR7 is one of the BEST of all time on the field, but he's a POS off the field.\n\nThe hate for this iconic player is unreal. Yeah he is old but it‚Äôs still CR7, put some respect on his name\n\nThe hate stems from the fact that he‚Äôs a complete knob, not from his ability as a player\n\n&gt; his ability as a player\n\nso why are people hating on this as well?\n\nOnce people (especially online) decide they don‚Äôt like someone, they‚Äôll just grab at anything and everything to hate on\n\nIt's wild to me that there are people who seem to find it genuinely incomprehensible that some folk just cannot stand Ronaldo; the guy has repeatedly demonstrated himself to be a *maaaassive* dickhead.  Being good at football does not and should not automatically entitle you to respect.\n\nTbf, it DOES entitle you to respect in regard to your accomplishments. Messi fan here, but people irrationally downplay Ronaldo‚Äôs achievements just because he‚Äôs a dickhead.\n\nThere are others who do and/or have done doubly dickish things yet don't even get half the hate.\n\nHe's one of the most famous and has large amounts of people who defend him for his wrong actions. That amplifies the hate he recieves\n\nHe will be at the next World Cup for Portugal too I guarantee it\n\nSome already said it here, we here in Portugal are grateful for everything he did for us in football and outside of it, Ronaldo is a brand and is more known that our country itself. But enough is enough, he is not a top player anymore and going to the euro would be ok if he was on bench most of time and played like 20 or 30 minutes in some games. But no, he will play all games 90 minutes or more, every play has to to involve him, he will have to score every penalty, every free kick and will have tantrums left and right in every game and will not defend and be mad if others dont pass him the ball or let him score. So yeah...it will be harmful for us and thats why many prefer not even watch the games anymore. Its just too painfull seeing one of the best Portuguese football generations of all time being wasted like these, and also seeing the fall of the best Portuguese player ever. Talking for myself and others here in Portugal we just want August to come and see our teams play because many of us dont like what our National team has become. Hope im wrong in all of this but i dont think i am.\n\nAs much as the narrative of \"Ronaldo bad, team good\" is what much of this sub pushes... He's a large part of why the generation is so good. He inspired so many of the players he's playing alongside. He's still the best striker Portugal has to offer. Yes, he can't track back and is, largely, a poacher now but who else would you rather have in his position? \n\nI truly think if others step up, Ronaldo can and will respect that. He's an insanely good playmaker, to this day, and doesn't need to be at the helm of the scoresheet (though he will want to take every FK/Penalty)\n\nHopefully the coach is willing to tell others that they will be taking the FK but leave the penalties and leadership to him. We saw what happened last euros.\n\nIf only Portugal players and fans respect Ronaldo as much as Argentinians support Messi, Portugal would be a different story, they need to actually get players that likes and wants to play with Ronaldo, Argentina and Messi become great once they got young players that were looking up at Messi instead of players that look at Messi as peers.\n\nThats true but dont forget Scaloni. Arguably the first competent coach for argentina since good knows when.\n\nTrue\n\nThats just what I call the ‚ÄúRoger Schmidt Experience‚Äú.\n\nIt won't be strange if he hits and the seventh Euro in his career in 2028... He'll be around 43... So why not his last Euro then?\n\nBecause at 43 he will have lost his body completely. The skill will still be there, but the pace(which is already going), stamina and energy just wont be there. And he wont keep playing if hes not playing well.\n\nIf that were true he'd have retired after the World Cup.\n\nHow many games until he is dropped as a starter?\n\n\nI bet half.\n\nWhy would he be? He's still the best striker Portugal got.\n\nHe's been in excellent shape this year so far. It's not like in the WC, where he wasn't match fit and barely played for half a year before tournament.\n\nYou can be a serious footballer or you can play in Saudi Arabia. But you can't do both\n\nOtavio and Ruben Neves plays there too and were both called up as well.\n\nI hope you keep the same energy for Messi then, weirdo.\n\nSo I'm assuming messi shouldn't play for Argentina again for being in mls?\n\nI've watched some MLS games and some Saudi League games.\n\nThe defending in Saudi League is miles above. The MLS defending looks like some random retirees after playing for 2h, eating and drinking beer in a random Sunday barbecue.\n\nThats undermining the other footballing leagues dude, even if its a inferior league it‚Äôs still a pro league and one of the better ones internationally, people actually act like if you don‚Äôt play in the top 5 leagues you‚Äôre not a good player the damn disrespect for other leagues is crazy they are still professionals and many of them trying to play the game while giving their best\n\nThe same Saudi Arabian players that defeated Argentina? Yeah. Don't think the Argentinians were having lasagna before the game.\n\nArgentina also lost to Uruguay in November. Do you think elite players should go to the Uruguayan Primera Divisi√≥n if they want to be taken seriously?\n\nIf Ronaldo wants to be paid millions to play walking football in the desert in front of 800 fans that's fine. Just don't expect me to take him seriously.\n\nThe problem is... yes he's our best striker, although I think Leao-Jota-Bernardo is the best front line, but he shouldn't start because of how much he demands players for the ball when it would be better if they played naturally as a team. \n\nHis ego influences the other players way too much (and he's not at that level anymore).\n\nJota is more of a second striker, he doesn't function well as the only striker.\n\nHe is in contention with Felix/Le√£o, not Ronaldo. Also Jota has been garbage for the NT.\n\nRonaldo post without criticism challenge, difficulty - impossible.\n\nWe usually should criticise¬†decisions that seem very dubious...\n\n\n\nBut since it's Ronaldo, you can't do it.\n\nBack on the bench for my camel\n\nNot surprised about this¬†\n\nGood I'm glad. His presence helps the tournament since he's such a big character.\n\nHis hotel will be right around the corner from me and he was there during the World cup 2006 aswell, crazy how long he is playing.\n\nWe need a new category, elderly world cup lol\n\nIsn‚Äôt this now a negative factor for the Portuguese national team?\n\nYes\n\nTeam is going nowhere with him playing.  Too bad.  They have talent\n\nHe‚Äôs hurting this Portugal team if he pushes to start\n\nRonaldo called up to sit on the bench and throw fits for not starting. The life üçπ\n\nSay what you will about Ronaldo, but the man is as disciplined and dedicated as they come. Work ethic second to none.\n\nHe's clutch and will probably score a couple important goals tbf\n\nYeah he's 3 years older now.\n\nIs he going to be a starter?\n\nMost likely\n\nImagine he's just beched üò≠\n\nHave a nice day!\n\nI am happy to see him play in Europe again\n\nSiuuuuuuuuuuu factos\n\nIt's just so wild to me that half of the experts predict Henderson will be picked for England for his \"experience and leadership\", but people find it weird to pick Ronaldo for a 26-player squad.\nWith these squad-sizes there will probably be like 6-10 players that don't get meaningful minutes. It just makes sense to use these slots on versatile backups, leaders and young players (to get experience ahead of the WC).\n\nHe should start on the bench if Portugal has better options, but he's surely a valuable asset off the pitch, and maybe even for the last 20.\nI can for sure see the problem with him possibly demanding to start when he probably shouldnt, but hopefully that part is already resolved.\n\n(...and obviously: Ronaldo &gt; Henderson)\n\nThose portuguese fans (if they are portuguese) proves to me that it's not just our fans who are dumb. It's most of football fans. Ronaldo is definitely far from his prime, yes. But Gonzalo Ramos starting over him would be a crime. And this kind of tells a lot about Portugal's squad, if you ask me.\n\nIf he wins , I am going bald\n\nCeltics are playing a team that‚Äôs been competing intensely to win their rounds.\n\nThat team is stacked though\n\nThat‚Äôs the only record he‚Äôll be making in this competition this time around\n\nGetting called up while playing in Saudi is wild.\n\nI like Ronaldo and Pepe. I don‚Äôt understand why Portugal try to utilise Bernardo silva more. That guy is very underrated for Portugal. And Bruno is overrated\n\nSuwi\n\nI don‚Äôt know why people are surprised by this.\n\nDespite their age they are still hold themselves to a high level.\n\nInternational football is generally inferior to the standard in Top European Leagues.\n\nSquads and even starting 11 can be a mish mash of multiple Leagues and multiple levels.\n\nNo way he starts games tho\n\nThe GOAT üêê\n\nI mean its not a bad thing if he acts like a leader at the training ground, give advices and boosts team morale. He definitely shouldnt start games and only take minutes after 70-80 if they're leading the game comfortably. \n\nBut its Ronaldo, who are we kidding, right?\n\nThis is the year\n\nThe greatest player in modern times. Even greater than Messi\n\nLet‚Äôs see what he does after that embarrassingly disastrous World Cup run.\n\nRidiculous that people still judge him based off that. He lost a son, and almost lost a daughter that year, and came into the tournament not match fit, and he barely played any full matches for half a year.\n\nNo wonder he was in poor shape.\n\nIt's obvious that missing pre-season due to losing his son took a toll on him physically and mentally. The fact people sling that World Cup on him when prior to that, he looked like he never played football before. Now, what seems more likely? One of, if not the best, player of all time suddenly became crap over a summer, or the personal anguish he went through was a factor.\n\nYeah he scored 2 PL hattricks in the 2 weeks before the death of his son, it's obvious how much it affected him, and how much missing out on the pre season affected his form."

    "body": "Hello r/football community!\n\n\n\n**TL;DR:** We are thrilled to announce that r/football is now the official main kit sponsor of Redditch United Football Club for the 2024-2025 season! Made possible with support from [~Reddit‚Äôs Community Funds program~](https://redditforcommunity.com/community-funds), this is an incredible opportunity to connect our passionate community, all 884,000 of you, with one of the most historic clubs in English football. We‚Äôre super excited to bring you on this journey with some awesome opportunities to directly connect with the club here in our community and even IRL.\n\n\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/d02i2by3achd1.gif\n\n\n\n**About Redditch United Football Club:**\n\nFounded in 1891, Redditch United boasts a rich history and deep roots in the football world. Over the years, the club has experienced many highs and lows, from competing in the Birmingham Combination to reaching the Southern Football League. Known for its unwavering dedication to the sport and local community, Redditch United has nurtured local talent and entertained generations of fans. Their journey through the decades has been marked by resilience, passion, and a true love for the beautiful game and their town.\n\nWhat else could you possibly need to know about Redditch when it inevitably comes up at your next pub quiz? Redditch United are the original Reds (sorry Liverpool fans, but Redditch United are one year older). Redditch United once played 9 games in 9 consecutive days, a world record. Redditch is also the hometown of John Bonham of Led Zeppelin and Harry Styles of One Direction - we're still waiting to hear back from Harry on our half-time karaoke concept.\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8db9y1p7achd1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=440d1de40348c8e7baf2d4aaaa0f79a2634fd6b7\n\n\n\n**Why Redditch?**¬†\n\nIf you haven‚Äôt clocked it yet, Redditch and Reddit are practically the same word. This partnership has long been written in the stars, and as of today, on football shirts too! Legend has it, back in 2005 Reddit‚Äôs name was actually inspired by Redditch United Football Club. Okay, so maybe we made that legend up just now, but either way, this partnership for our community is a no brainer. An open goal. The real question is, why has it taken this long!? Redditch United is a historic club that is entirely community focused. Not only is the naming convention perfectly suitable, but the community spirit of the club matches that of our own here at r/football. We couldn‚Äôt think of a more perfect club to sponsor.\n\n\n\n**How r/football is involved:**\n\nThis sponsorship is the real deal. r/football will be front and center throughout the season (continue reading for an exciting reveal!). We‚Äôll also be bringing you one-of-a-kind opportunities to be part of this sponsorship, including Ask Me Anything (AMA) sessions with both players and staff, exciting giveaways featuring mystery prizes, and much more! This collaboration is all about celebrating our shared love for football and creating unforgettable experiences for you, our amazing community.\n\n\n\n**The moment you‚Äôve been waiting for:**\n\nWe‚Äôre excited to give you the very first look at the Redditch United kits. Please keep in mind that these are mock-ups, but we wanted you to be the first to see the sponsorship come to life! While the games aren‚Äôt televised, we‚Äôll be following along on Saturday, August 10th for the club‚Äôs season opener.¬†\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wmn8ma1cachd1.jpg?width=8000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=17b5b9d801011de039c2dec486d47d892a50dc3b\n\nTheir first home game of the season is set for this coming **Monday 12th August at 7:45PM BST**. We may have more updates for you then‚Ä¶ üëÄ!\n\nWe hope you‚Äôre as pumped about this as we are. This is going to be a thrilling season, with so many more updates to come, including kit releases, in-ground signage reveals, and deep dives into this promising club.

I know there was an interest years ago through r/soccer but I never thought anyone would take it seriously.

My home town club. Just got a season ticket for this year üòÄüòÄüòÄ\n\nFair play guys, as a Redditch fan this is great news for our club.

That is amazing! üëèüëèüëè\n\nReplica shirts can be ordered and dispatched globally though our club shop:\nhttps://vx-3.com/collections/redditch-united-fc\n\nCongratulations sir.\n\n May I make a suggestion, don't know if it's still possible but popular opinion is that the Reddit logo on the kit should be reworked a bit. \n\nMost people suggest, getting rid of the orange background behind the \"Reddit\" or just putting the Reddit alien logo on there or even just boldening the Reddit font and losing the orange background. \n\nDon't know if anything can be done at this point or if a separate \"special\" kit can be released but just a suggestion from the people around. \n\nCongratulations once again, seems like a big deal for the club, I'll definitely be paying attention to you guys. Excellent work.\n\nThat blue jersey is absolutely cooking. If that becomes real I‚Äôd wanna bag one of those\n\nIt is real! üëÄ\nPre-order is available here - https://vx-3.com/collections/redditch-united-fc\n\nBloke from Redditch here üëã will the shirt be available to buy locally so I don‚Äôt have to pay the shipping fee!?\n\nThey certainly will be! We are currently awaiting delivery of a batch of tops so that we can sell (and show them off) at the Club.\n\nWe're expecting delivery in the next few weeks.\n\nNice one, thanks!\n\nThey should sign Hummels,Martial,Ramos,Pepe and Rabiot\n\nIsn't pepe retiring¬†\n\nThis is pretty cool.\n\nGod damn I might have to start a football manager save with these guys\n\nKeep us updated on your save!\n\nGet promoted to the 5th stage of football and then I'll be able to do a Fifa save¬†\n\nWow my home town club, massive for non-league!\n\nWhat tier are they in? I only understand lower league English football via following Hashtag United‚Ä¶ where would this compare on a pyramid?\n\nThey play in something called Southern Football League - Premier Division Central, which is apparently 7th level of English football.\n\nLast year they finished 4th in a league of 22 teams, and qualified for promotion playoffs, but didn‚Äôt make it through.\n\nThey used to be owned by some businessman called Chris Swan (2011-20) who [sold it to a former coach](https://www.thenonleaguefootballpaper.com/latest-news/31109/new-redditch-united-owner-david-faulkner-took-charge-for-supporters/) called David Faulkner.\n\nSame level, different league. Hashtag are the Isthmian League, Redditch are Southern League\n\nWe're step 3, 7th tier, southern league central, three leagues below the EFL\n\nPeople are often surprised that this sub is about football of the soccer kind and not the handegg version. I wouldn't be surprised if the subscriber count on this sub went up quite a bit due to this sponsorship.\n\nGreat kits. It‚Äôs easy to go overboard with a design like on the away shirt, but this is still very tasteful. The children did a lovely job. \n\nDoes the club have a nickname?\n\nThe Reds\n\nThanks. I read the part about Liverpool, but somehow missed that.\n\n\"The 'ditch\" is also more than ok to call us \n\nUP THE DITCH\n\nIndeed, we don‚Äôt take it as an insult üòå\n\nThis is awesome, I'm only a couple of towns over from Redditch in Kidderminster. Will try and make it over for a game at some point. Would love to see them against the Harriers in a cup competition or something\n\nPlayed them in preseason last year, although we could meet in the county cup at some stage.\n\nRedditch are my second team, and I'm stoked to see Reddit on the front of the shirt for this season. Let's go!\n\nLFG\n\nBonzo would be equally excited to see this. Let's go! ‚öΩÔ∏è\n\nWe‚Äôve done 4 already, and now we‚Äôre steady!\n\nVery unexpected, with me being involved with the club üòÖ look forward to seeing the community follow our fortunes!\n\nMatch made in heaven.\n\nIncredible achievement by all involved. As a life long Reds fan I can't wait to see how this takes off!\n\nThis is crazy GL\n\nWhich league?\n\nWe play in the Southern League Central Premier, Step 3 of non league (Tier 7 of the English pyramid). So we're one below National League North/South!\n\nAll the best for promotion.\n\nBrilliant news\n\nWhen do I need to get a red itch looked at?\n\nAbsolutely love that away shirt might have to buy one\n\nI did always read it as Reddit FC lol\n\nWe got reddit fc before gta 6\n\nThat's a brilliant idea! \nMy home town club too, look forward to seeing how this develops üëè\n\nWe got reddit football club and still Tottenham has no trophies\n\nAlways rated them\n\nu/xhandler\n\nTime to find a FM database and make you guys win the Champions League and the Premier League\n\nLet us know how you get on and what players impress you!\n\nNext football manager save ‚úÖ\nNext jersey to purchase ‚úÖ\n\nWe like the idea of both of those! Keep us updated on the FM save ü§©\n\nWhat a great way to partner and build commufrom both sides! Wishing you a great season!\n\nLove it!\n\n  \nLooking forward to wearing this down the Valley Stadium\n\nThis is so cool and very clever. I will definitely buy a shirt and follow Redditch. Kudos to all involved.\n\nWould look so much better without the orange background\n\nNo r/redditch mention? Is it not the same club?\n\nCan I still criticize / not support them ?\n\nSometimes, I dream about chesse\n\nRedditch will be the next Man City at this rate\n\nRedditch are great team and that's the first team I ever saw in mt lufe\n\nMy sister used to play for the academy back in the 2010s\n\nLooks decent\n\ni can hold the water\n\nWe LOVE this! We're really looking forward to continuing our support for the club this season and can‚Äôt wait to see what this partnership brings. Up the Reds üî¥\n\nWow. That‚Äôs cool!\n\nAmazing! This is very innovative. Look forward to further updates.\n\nWhy is reddit way bigger and prominent on the kit, then r/football, i realize that people have to get where to find it, but shouldn't it at least be about the same?\n\nReddit is funding this so they definitely want some advertising for their site\n\nSo basically mods now get VIP seats and hospitality with reddit's money. How to apply?\n\nOh man.  Couldn't you have journeyed a little further down the road and helped the Harriers out?  They really need it!\n\nImagine having Reddit on your sports kit. They are like polar opposites lol.\n\nCome to Beskitas üáπüá∑üáπüá∑üáπüá∑\n\nHi\n\nOk\n\njust throwing it out there.\n\nThank you very much for choosing and using my 3D t-shirt mockups to showcase the Redditch United kits. This will help build trust in me and my Vision Season mockups.\n\nAnyone know where I can buy a Reddit jersey? Team store doesn‚Äôt seem to have one\n\nHopefully this can continue, this sponsorship is amazing\n\nso cool this is great thank you for supporting Redditch Reddit great move\n\nBrilliant. I remember my school, Bridley Moor, and the one in town organised a massive fight to take place outside the gates of Valley Stadium, about 200 people turned up, but in the end we just dossed around for a bit and made some friends\n\nNext season please choose r/Hentai. üòÇ\n\nI guess that's neat and all, but whose idea was this, who was organizing/pushing for this, and how is the community involved? I check this subreddit probably once a day, and I've never seen a single post about this. also if you check out the mods, most of them aren't even active on reddit anymore (one is even suspended), so was anyone of them involved in this? idk, this feels very corporate \"we're totally one of you guys!!\" forced community interaction.   \nbasically, if this is supposed to be funded by the community, I'd like to learn more about who among the community was involved in this and why. perhaps I've just been missing all the buzz and communication among the community about it. otherwise this feels like extremely inorganic marketing.\n\nThe mods were absolutely involved from beginning.\nNot sure why you expected to see a post here *before* an announcement?\n\nhow exactly were you involved? wouldn't it be interesting to show parts of the process to the community? the post specifically says that \"we\" as /r/football sponsored some club, so wouldn't it only be logical that the community was involved somehow? or does the \"we\" only mean the r/football mods?\n\nI feel the post describes how the community is involved, I quote:\n\n&gt;We‚Äôll also be bringing you one-of-a-kind opportunities to be part of this sponsorship, including Ask Me Anything (AMA) sessions with both players and staff, exciting giveaways featuring mystery prizes, and much more!

    "all_comment_text": "Came close to ending the run today, but it's not the first time that has happened this season. The way that team finds a way to get atleast a point from being a goal down is really impressive. I hope they can reach atleast 50 unbeaten games in a row.\n\nMassive respect to Xabi and his squad but reaching 50 unbeaten games just seems impossible. Their schedule sucks Dortmund in 3 days then Stutgart that gave them massive troubles early on in a season....but hey if they do it they are forever kings. Levekusen better get renamed to ALONSOKUSEN. Seriously what an increadible achievement this would be if they win/draw everything possible in a season. Maybe even UEFA Super Cup\n\nStuttgart game is at home so i think they‚Äôre probably fine, but Dortmund away will be difficult especially since they drew the opposite leg\n\nBut with this team, a 90+7 goal can clinch a draw to continue the streak, who‚Äôs to say?\n\nAlso I‚Äôd argue they‚Äôre already forever kings\n\nDortmund always there to screw anyone that is not Bayern. So you never know.\n\nYou were on the mark with the 90+7 goal to keep the streak going.\n\nHoly shit I didn‚Äôt even realize, call me Nostradamus\n\nYou for real predicted that shitüò≠\n\nIf they go the entire season unbeaten in all competitions, it's up there with the greatest sporting achievements of all time.\n\nSo close, as well. 5 more games in the Buli including those games against dortmund and stuttgart, a cup final against 2nd tier kaiserslautern, and two legs of a europa league semi final against roma, and then the final if they get through that. 9 games from glory. I'm so invested in this now\n\nPersonally I can't see it happening. I just think, mentally, winning the league already they are bound to slip slightly in the league possibly even in favour of focusing on the EL now.\n\n\nIf they do it, absolutely willing to eat my words.\n\nThis is the bit people always overlook when discussing the significance of unbeaten runs. When you‚Äôve already won the league, particularly by a landslide like Arsenal 04 did, it becomes a real challenge to keep up the same drive. It‚Äôs one of the reasons I think they drew so many in the run-in, they no longer needed to win cause the league was wrapped up. It just becomes about not losing. Obviously Leverkusen play a few games less, but I‚Äôm sure those few will prove to be a bigger challenge than most.\n\nYeah, there's this kind of unconscious block that can sometimes develop imo. Just from my own completely non-football related job, last year I got a better offer so moved but was committed to work 6 months notice. I felt like I was still working to the same standard, but I kept making stupid mistakes. My head just wasn't there even though I felt like I was being the exact same.\n\nDortmund I think is the toughest. They may not always perform like they did vs Atletico but if they do they're very dangerous.\n\nLol\n\nthey are in 49th streak it seems possible now\n\nThey are legends...its indescribable how incredible their achievements is in football.\n\nTheir run has been close to ending numerous times but they come up last minutes again. Qarabag were 2-0 up in both games and failed to win as one example\n\nDid you notice how they tricked West Ham, though? They started outright time wasting to frustrate West Ham and make them error-prone, but the equalizer was what they were actually going for, not maintaining the score.\n\ni want them to go all the way. 4 cup games including domestic and 5 league games I think left. away at roma and bundesliga vs. dortmund are probably the toughest for now.\n\nwhy do people keep saying they came close to losing today? \n\nThey were 3-1 up at worst the entire match.\n\nThey were losing 1-0 and managed to make it 1-1 in the 89th minute.\n\nOh I see they were risking their undefeated record not the actual tie. My mistake.\n\nWas very close this time\n\nThis time? They've scored mostly last min goals in EL knockout stage\n\nBundesliga as well.\n\n[removed]\n\nReally? Who in their right mind can actually say something like that?\n\n[removed]\n\nThat's great, because MUTD fans have been jeering managers off for no reason. Wasted so many good managers this way. I don't think anyone better than Ten Hag would want to go anywhere near United at this point.\n\nI hear Allegri has been learning English.....\n\nSack and repeat, sack and repeat sack and repeat, sack and repeat. The bulk of the poisonous core of players are still at the club, INEOS' structure still isn't fully in place, no sane manager should and would take this job till there's proper structure. Every manager up till EtH has had to deal with an insanely poorly run club and players on stupid contracts that make them next to impossible to move on. \n\nThe likes of Pep and Klopp came into clubs with systems in place, and got at least 3 seasons before stuff started to happen.\n\nCity won the league in his second season and Klopp was challenging for champions league within 2 seasons with a very underpowered squad, so your 3 season narrative isn‚Äôt true.\n\nAll the same, they are managers who came into well run clubs with proper structure. Underpowered so what? They were unburdened with the shit United has to deal with. If these many managers can't do shit, that speaks to a deeper problem.\n\nI agreed with most of your statement just not that part\n\nMan Utd fans apparently\n\nWell I'm a United fan and I'll never be caught saying such things. Club bias easily turns into delusions if you happen to be a moron\n\nFair enough. I was talking about the Utd fans commenter was talking about.\n\nIt is very unlikely that most fans would agree with that\n\nTrue. Even then, wtf\n\nProbably more the fact you think a Liverpool legend would turn down Liverpool then go to United in the first place, never mind a United side that‚Äôs an absolute shambles\n\n[removed]\n\ni always got the impression he cares for the clubs he played. I dont think it is farfetched to think he is not gonna go to united or everton or anything.\n\nThat‚Äôs like saying zidane would happily manage Barcelona because he‚Äôs french.\n\nHe‚Äôs gone on record multiple times saying he‚Äôs a Liverpool fan, he‚Äôs raised his Liverpool-born son to be a Liverpool fan I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôd let his dad go to United lol\n\nYou'll get that in many subs. \n\nI'm a Liverpool fan &amp; if certain players are playing awful, I'll get downvoted for calling them out.\n\nLeast reactionary statement\n\nI find it staggering how many people on the Man United subs are so behind Ten Hag.\n\nIt‚Äôs the Ajax fans downvoting you\n\nNah they are upvoting. We want ten hag to get fired so he comes back. Definitely not coping\n\nsome people are just idiots. or delusional\n\n  \nfor United fans it's often both\n\nWeird self martyrdom. All your comments are anti-ETH and they‚Äôre all upvoted. It‚Äôs literally the easiest thing you can do in any United sub these days lol\n\nWith a London accent.\n\nHradecky goated goalkeeper\n\nHe is, but he didn't play yesterday.\n\nPeople need to remember Ajax of 1995, the Dutch league was a top league then and they won the champions league and went unbeaten all season.\n\nWhat a squad they had, kluivert, seedorf, Kanu, de boer x2, overmars, Rijkaard, Blind, Litmanen and Davids\n\nNot all season. Lost in the Dutch cup quarterfinals against Feyenoord. It was their only loss in the season though.\n\nThanks for the correction\n\nFirst team to remain unbeaten? There‚Äôs got to be a way to phrase that better. Longest-unbeaten side from a big-five league etc.\n\nlets go for a season!\n\nRangers had a 44 game unbeaten run in 92/93 that included a domestic treble and going unbeaten in 10 CL games. Though they did lose 4 games out of 64 that season\n\nOnlykusen\n\nGood for them. I hope they go the whole season\n\nXabi Alonso took what pep showed him and made it better. Starting with a team thats lower in the table, mad respect for this legend\n\nalways a nice one\n\nTbf the referee played on their side...\n\nXabi is too good for the premier league. Honestly he's a cut a ove the rest. Premier league doesn't even have a team in the last 4 honestly lmao premier league such a joke, farmers league omg not even in top leagues. Their best players always leave to play abroad. No English manager ever won a premier bruh lmao honestly such a joke.\n\nRent free\n\nThe best team was either Real Madrid or Manchester City and Real just squeaked past them. I‚Äôd agree everyone else shit the bed though\n\nand they only needed a referee and 2 linesmen to do it!\n\nWant more salt? Just that little bit of extra joy sending you entitled pricks home.\n\nEntitled? We shafted them in the first half, English football is materially better than the other countries\n\nCould see that which is way you are all out, other than hoofball and running around like crazy men you have nothing to offer. Plus a few nice libraries you have there tbf üòÇ\n\nSounds like someone is burning because they live in some 2-bob town and can't make it in \n\nCAPITAL CITAY!\n\nHow does this bubble story work?\nAre they all made of salty tears?\n\nThey're gonna win it, a proper competition too, not like that micky mouse shit they had to invent so the shit teams would have a chance to win a \"European trophy\".\n\nYou lot all used to call the Europa league tinpot, you make it up as you go along üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ\n\nWe got three of them, it gets old. üòÇ"

[https://x.com/TheEuropeanLad/status/1811303728709783712](https://x.com/TheEuropeanLad/status/1811303728709783712)\n\nJust change the ref for this game to avoid any controversy for fucks sake.\n\nThey‚Äôd rather fine the players pointing out the problems than fix it apparently.\n\nThat would require someone admitting they made a wrong decision god forbid that from the crusty old farts that run UEFA\n\nYou're assuming the UEFA Referee's Committee is legit.¬†\n\n\nOne of their members, Dagmar Damikova, is married to Roman Berbr. He was convicted in 2023 of match fixing and embezzlement, being the ring leader of an eastern European gang.\n\nRing leader of an Eastern European gang sounds so much better than Bulgarian oligarch and politician, even though they are the same thing.\n\nIn 2015 fifa committee members were convicted by fbi. Also members of conmebol they‚Äôre all corrupt.\n\nNah, we had to go through an Antony Taylor Game. \n\nThis is what you get, England!\n\nOh come on, we have had both Taylor and Zwayer and now we got Zwayer again.\n\nWe go through an Antony Taylor game every week. You have got off light.\n\nHow? European football corruption knows no bounds.\n\nThey might have some bounds. They just banned this guy from doing any match fixing for this game.¬†\n\nHe'd have to be an aboslute idiot to fix the game now that he's under a mgnifying glass.  The only way noise and drama comes out of this is if he is an absolute idiot, or from idiot fans\n\nI agree for the most part but even then imagine even offering this guy a job\n\nOr if he overcorrects to avoid coming across as match fixing. Or if he undercorrects to show that he isn‚Äôt concerned.\nIs it so hard to find a ref who didn‚Äôt do the ultimate worst thing any ref can possibly do?\n\nIt's also the fact that he was very publicly criticised by England's star player a couple of years ago¬†\n\nHow can this guy be involved with top level football at all? This guy should be out of a job. Give him a job in Italian football and never let him manage internationally ever again\n\nI don't have a clear picture, but it seems he was an assistant referee who received 300 euros from the head referee immediately before a match.\n\nHe didn't report the issue immediately, and he claims that he didn't change any calls, but it sounds like he got a deal (6 month suspension) in exchange for providing evidence.\n\nHe did the wrong thing, but I suspect that he was more motivated by not wanting to rock the boat than financial greed.  He's probably learned his lesson.\n\nIt was a 300 euro payment 19 years ago, I think it's fine.\n\nYou say that but Anthony Taylor goes and fucks Chelsea every time he referees them despite having a known predilection to doing so.\n\nYou'd have to be an absolute idiot to fix a match for ‚Ç¨300 and put your career in jeopardy as well, so...\n\nI hate Zwayer. But he wasn't the main culprit in the marchfixing, that was Robert Hoyzer the head referree. Zwayer took part in it as a part of the referee team. And allegedly later helped to uncover the matchfixing.\n\ndoesnt change the fact he is a shit ref\n\nIn other words.  Zwayer was an accessory to match fixing crime.  Instead of being sentenced equally guilty.  He offered himself as a witness in exchange for a lesser sentence.  Still guilty.\n\nWe should consider getting African referees. They are really, really good, no joke.\n\nRefs already get insane abuse (even the better ones), I wouldn't want my African brothers to be subject to racism on top of that.\n\nI honestly couldn't imagine a worse job than being a football ref.\n\nThey rather ban players for YEARSSSSS. And suspend refs for months\n\nThat aged well\n\nWhy? I still stand by what i said, he shouldn‚Äôt be refereeing games of that magnitude, or any really.\n\nDidn't you watch the game last night? The referee was biased as sluck. Game ended in Controversy.\n\nWell you‚Äôve just proven my point for me than haven‚Äôt you.\n\nI wasn't disputing\n\nI think the reason many Bundesliga viewers don't like Zwayer is due to his oftentimes not so excellent refereeing  and not due to the Hoyzer-Scandal. He helped to uncover it and served his time, thats fair in my opinion.\n\nHe isn't the worst we have but definitely not one of the best either. Its just a shame that every time he blunders this story is conjured up to weave a \"how can he even ref anymore!?\" narrative.\n\n&gt; He helped to uncover it and served his time, thats fair in my opinion.\n\nYeah but that doesn't mean you get your same very important job back at the same thing you've already proven you're corrupt for. If a bank teller attempted to rob a bank they wouldn't get that job back as soon as they got out of prison. It's insane that they're willing to do it for a cheating ref.\n\nThis üëÜüèº\nSpecific jobs are restricted in this kind of way for a reason. In these jobs customers need to trust the person, so the persons integrity must be without any doubt. Once the integrity is gone - there is no coming back.\n\nIt doesn't matter, that Zwayer snitched. He knew the risk, still took the money and his integrity was gone.\n\nThe \"interesting\" part is: Zwayer wasn't banned as a ref, was never publicly charged and still works in real estate. But iirc he didn't got his license - would probably be denied anyway because lack of integrity\n\nIt‚Äôs insane that he should ever be allowed to work as a referee again. Anyone who brings into question the integrity of the game should never be allowed to be a position like that again. Match fixing by a referee should be a lifetime ban from the sport.\n\nHe didn't match fix. His best friend since childhood did and he knew about it. He helped the investigation and served as a crown-witness - somewhere along the way I'm sure he struck a deal that if he were to testify, he could keep refereeing. I'm not saying he should be allowed to ref, I don't know what to think of it, I'm just saying HE didn't match fix or get anything from it. The money his friend offered him, he declined.\n\nI read he took money as part of the fix. 300 Euros to be exact.\n\nGerman authorities were sure he did but it couldn't be proven. \n\n\nPart of the problem is that he wasn't payed to fix but to keep quiet about the fixing, so when they reviewed the matches in question they obviously couldn't find anything.\n\nOr that, could be as well, haven't read the original story in a while. Either way, he didn't fix anything - he just didn't rat out his best friend (until he did :D). Again, I'm not sure I'd want him reffing as well, just clarifying because most people think he actually fixed a game himself.\n\nFrom the article \n\n&gt; A 2005 investigation found that Zwayer accepted a bribe to favour German club Wuppertaler SV in their match against Werder Bremen Amateure in May 2004.\n\nThat's a very compact ESPN-article which is stating baseless \"facts\".\n\nHe was banned for 6-months because he knew about Hoyzer fixing a match but didn't tell the authorities. \nIt was rumored that he accepted 300‚Ç¨ by Hoyzer to help out as a lines-ref in fixing, which he denies to this day and which wasn't proven. \n\nMy point stands, he was banned not for match-fixing, but for not telling on his best friend. \n\nDo I think he took the 300‚Ç¨ and maybe missed an offside or two (in an amateur game btw)? Probably, and if so, he shouldn't ever ref again - BUT it was never proven, so ESPN saying he took it and was banned for it is wrong.\n\nEdit: There's lots of articles that delve deeper into this, but they're all in German. If you're German, just google it \\^^\n\nMost of us dont like him because he gets, as a mediocre referee, the most important games all the time. Also \"helped uncover it\" is a stretch. They officals basically knew something was up, and Zwayer came clean at the last possible second, after Gr√§fe told him, that Hoyzer is under investigation.\n\n&gt;Its just a shame that every time he blunders this story is conjured up to weave a \"how can he even ref anymore!?\" narrative.\n\nDas ist keine Schande. Es ist \"Berufe\" bzw. Berufungen, bei denen du moralisch v√∂llig unverf√§nglich sein musst. Richter, Kassenwarte etc. Ein Schiedsrichter auch. Ein Schiedsrichter, der bewiesenerma√üen Bestechungen annimmt, ist moralisch nicht mehr in der Position, seinen Beruf auszu√ºben.\nVor allem nicht im Profibereich.\n\nHow can he even ref anymore though. It‚Äôs not as though he can‚Äôt be replaced. Cheating and financially benefiting should have landed him jail time.\n\nAh yes the worst referee in German football, suppose it‚Äôs only fair\n\nWe get Taylor, you get Zwayer. Perfectly balanced\n\nHe took 300‚Ç¨ as an assistant referee/linesman 20years ago in the third league.\n\nHe reported the whole incidident quite late, but it lead to the uncovering of the bigger match-fixing scandal.\n\nHe served his ban.\n\nHe's not been reasonably suspected of any match fixing since then.\n\nYou leave out quite a lot of details though. The guy is not a good referee, just based on performances and somehow he gets all the big games in Germany and internationally. It‚Äôs one thing to give games to a underperforming referee but to give them to a referee with his history is well an interesting choice‚Ä¶\n\nHim not being a good referee is not topic of this discussion. But you're right, he sucks.\n\nNeither is Taylor in england, yet here we are.\n\nThe associations somehow manage to send their worst refs to internationals, no fkn clue why.\n\n&gt;The guy is not a good referee. \n\nThat's just your opinion. Statistics had him as one of the best referees in Europe last season.\n\nWhere can one find those ratings? Did not find them in a quick google search.\n\n[Kicker](https://www.kicker.de/bundesliga/schiedsrichterstatistik/2023-24/34) had him as the 3rd best referee last season in the Bundesliga.\n\nNot even the best in his respective league\n\nKicker grading is well questionable at best. I feel like they give out outrageous grades sometimes so that people engage more. Like the neuer rating after the Germany Algeria game 2014\n\nRating referees is always questionable.\n\nEdit: Also looked up Neuers grade from back then, and it was a 1,5 the second best possible grade.\n\nJust one that I‚Äôve remembered, cause in my opinion pretty awful rating. That was one of the best goalkeeper performances I‚Äôve ever seen. Pretty much neuers best game and had some absolute miraculous saves and still no 1.0. like literally one of the best goalkeeper performances of all time\n\nAny official who accepts a bribe to fix any professional match should have a lifetime ban from refereeing professional matches in my opinion. It's not like it's something which can happen by accident or that he didn't understand the rules. The integrity of the game is at risk if we are appointing referees who are guilty of accepting bribes. This seems obvious to me. \n\nThis story has gained significant traction and now if he has a dodgy game which appears to favour one team over another the validity of the result will be called into question. It seems like an unnecessary risk to take.\n\nA reason he did not receive a lifelong ban is that he was helpful to uncover the bigger scandal. That way he traded his information and his appearance as a witness for a smaller fine. That's pretty common.\n\nThe integrity of the game is also at question if we allow players who betted on games they had inside knowledge of, or participated in to continue playing.\n\nBy that logic you can also ban Ivan Toney for life. Oh wait, he already contributed towards England getting to the semis.\n\nAbsolutely should be perma banned\n\nIs it not strange they don‚Äôt just get rid for good?\n\nThank you. \nBellingham accused him again of match-fixing, after a match without any actual wrong calls, just because Jude was unhappy about losing. And this Bellingham-shitshow is now used against the ref as an argument? Ridiculous.\n\nIf anyone enters the game biased, it is Jude, not the ref.\n\nThe ref could very easily have bad blood against Jude though... \n\nWhy not just appoint a ref who doesn't have this history with one of the players, I don't get it at all\n\nYou would open up a very obvious door for any player/team that does not like the style of a specific referee. Just make anyone in the team (even a non-player) complain harshly &amp; openly about the ref and claim afterwards, that the ref is now biased for eternity because your team insulted him. #victimblaming\n\nThe credo always needs to be, that a professional ref is neutral in any situation.\n\nOtherwise you would need to change refs inbetween games now, as soon as one team insulted the ref during the game.\n\nBut Bellingham was punished for his comments... it isn't just accepted as fine to criticise refs with no downside\n\nThere is a difference in justified &amp; professionally criticising a ref and in unjustified insulting him or even unjustified accusing him of an actual crime. \n\nSo it was right to punish Bellingham, and it is also right to not give him a free-Zwayer-pass for the rest of his career.\n\n[deleted]\n\nYou have to be borderline braindead to not think this is a conflict of interest on the refs part.\n\n&gt;If anyone enters the game biased, it is Jude, not the ref.\n\nOne would think he'd keep his mouth shut after them graciously lifting his suspension, but nope.\n\nIt would be hilarious if they reinstated the suspension after he opened his mouth.\n\nThats just a lie of an Munich fanboy who cant stand the truth, that BVB got sold that game by Zwayer.\n\nUrgh.. Here we go again.. Come on.. just post that spox slideshow.. You feelin‚Äô the urge.. don‚Äôt ya?\n\nAll things aside.. we talk about Zwayer!!‚Ä¶ I really just want to remember you: It was the FCB who suffered most from him! He refused a 100% penalty even after going to VAR. \n\nHow come that someone could accuse the FCB from profiting from Zwayer? He probaply stole us a whole fuckn cup. Despite VAR!\n\nLet just settle it:\n\nZwayer is a really bad ref who profits a lot from the intransparent and corrupt ref leaders from both DFB and DFL.\n\nI don‚Äôt care what Zwayer did to other clubs. \nBut I know what he did that game. And that‚Äôs what it was about..\n\nPerpetual victims, always everyone elses fault that Dortmund suck\n\nYou just can‚Äôt handle facts. \nAnd in that game it was a fact. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\n\nOh look‚Ä¶. Zwayer‚Äôs burner account\n\nDortmund lost the game fair and square. Bellingham looking at the ref for mistakes and not his own team is so typical of him.\n\nThanks for this, everything I read was making it out to be a very recent thing and that he was Satan himself\n\nGenuine question. do you know what was the $300 for? Did he help fix a game or was he just careless? I cant seem to find the specifics online\n\nafaik (no source available, hearsaying), it was for \"not cause resp. overlook any critical situation\". But I stand to be corrected.\n\nFrom what I have seen the ref was fixing the game, he was an assistant and was basically paid off to turn a blind eye, eventually he decided to report the ref and was punished for taking the bribe in the first place and for not reporting the ref when it happened\n\nFrom what I've read he got the money before the game to help fix a game, but he never did and an investigation didn't find any proof that he did. He then reported this and was banned because he accepted the money. \nShould he have accepted the money? No, but it's not the end of the world. If he should have been banned for life for that thing, then the same could be said about every player who was caught better on games, even if it wasn't on their own games. \n\nFrom what I can tell, the ref has had a solid career since that happened 20 years ago and there hasn't been any investigations involving him. Nobody seemed to have any problems or suspicions about him in the several years between when it happaned and when the investigations was revealed. Then Bellingham cried about it and people started talking about it again. \n\nI'm okay with the ref continue working, though I can understand the problem with him refereeing this game with Bellinghim in one of the teams. I'm sure he can be professional, but the scrutiny will be insane and who knows how much that can affect him. Unless his decisions regarding incidents involving Jude are absolutely perfect, there will be people crying about \"unfair treatment\" and \"he's out to get Jude!\". Heck, if Bellingham is sent off for jumping in with both feet, studs up, through the air into someones head, people will still claims that the ref is biased.\n\nsink waiting panicky telephone selective aromatic roof squeal dull absurd\n\n *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev)*\n\nHe should be given a LIFETIME ban.\n\nHave you seen the game vs Romania? He fucked up a lot but only in favor of the dutch, i guess that‚Äôs ok.\n\n300 euros? That's like rent for a week. How stupid are they?\n\n[removed]\n\nBellingham will. Even when England wins 5-0\n\nHe also has a history with Bellingham. Clear conflict of interest.\n\nMy friend, Jude called him out on 2021, and the guy filled a criminal case against him. How is that fair\n\nHow does that prove anything?\n\nIt's not about proving anything. That is just a conflict of interest. Is there not a better person to officiate this match? Maybe someone that hasn't been in a legal dispute with one of the players?\n\nDoes the fact that he was clearly biased towards the SAME Netherlands in the 1/16 vs Romania is also not suspicious? How on earth is remotely acceptable to appoint the same referee to the same team in the same Euros elimination stages? Are all the referees injured?\n\nUAE money already dropped so he can help the UAE backed national team.\n\nDamn, so he doesn't need our 300‚Ç¨ anymore. We have to crowdfund ...üòî\n\nHe already have ¬£300, that worth more :)\n\nMake him bet minimum 5 goals\n\nFelix Zwayer is gonna Felix Zwayer. Advantage Netherlands.\n\nHe did indeed Felix Zwayer, except the advantage was for England\n\nAs a romanian a very deep and sincere fuck you :)\n\nSa ne pisam pe el\n\nShould he be banned from football or what is the implication?\n\nHe has been reffing for almost 20 years since and was already caught. Did he become a criminal mastermind all of a sudden that's fixing the biggest games in the world or what is the accusation here?\n\nThe context is. Jude called him out on it and implied he shouldn‚Äôt be reffing at top level when he was at Dortmund. Jude got a fine. And the ref took a break from the game before returning because it was a very big story in Germany at the time.  Now hes reffing jude jn a massive game. Come on\n\nPlayers doing the same wouldnt be able to do what hes done.\n\nI understand the context but still don't see how any of this would justify a ban?\n\nI stole from store from a store as a teenager, should i be banned from all kiosk i go to forever now? I stole less than 20 years ago, meaning it's been longer since this ref was banned for match fixing. But apparently his behaviour dosen't need any critical analysis beyond 2005?\n\nDoes the same apply to Jude Bellingham, should we just fine him for unsportsmanlike conduct after every game, because in 2021 he was punished for doing so? Or is there different standards for the footballers you like than the refs?\n\nZwayer should not have been allowed to go pro after his fuck-up. But he did, and he was and is decent/good and neutral enough to go on the highest level.\n\nJude accusing him after a game of match-fixing just because he was unhappy about losing that game, without any actual wrong decisions by the ref,  tells you more about Jude's character than about the ref's.\n\nAnd Jude's misbehaviour should not be an argument against the ref leading that game (or any game including Jude ever again). So far, only Jude has proven to be unfairly biased towards the ref, not the other way around.\n\nI get you. Whats the punishment for players taking bribes though? I mean there are loads of refs. And trust is an issue at the best of times. Poor decision to let him ref at this level.\n\nThere are several cases of players getting only temporarily banned for betting on their own matches. Sandro Tonali did it, Nicolo Fagioli owed millions to shady gambling people, made some suspicious mistakes during games (16.04.23 Juve vs Sassoulo) and guess who played at the Euros after serving a seven month ban?\n\nNone of them took bribes. They just bet on matches\n\nNo need to take bribes when you can bet with your own millions and fix them by yourself\n\nI get your point. Dont disagree. But they are different charges with very different punishments.\n\nYes he should be banned in any logical world, but this is Fifa here.\n\nUEFA\n\nHe definitely has some serious dirt from the Hoyzer scandal on important people at the DFB, that's the only way it makes sense he's still officiating high profile games in Germany and internationally\n\nBased on what? \n\nYou're just making that up, you have no idea. Could also be he just stopped match fixing now that he realizes he would get punished and perhaps became more financially secure. You can't fire someone just because you can make up a story where he is corrupt. Usually it requires things like real evidence, like when he got banged in court.\n\nthis guy is genuinely the worst referee I‚Äôve ever seen except maybe Anthony Taylor\n\nMike Dean has to be up there. Or that guy who only gave a Yellow when Xavi Alonso got dropkicked in the chest.\n\nIt was Howard Webb\n\npublic march consist smoggy frightening rob hard-to-find frighten encouraging saw\n\n *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev/home)*\n\nAnd didn't award a cornerkick and in the aftermath Iniesta scored the winner in extra time. Because Webb is an asshole.\n\nI disagree. Ovrebo (Chelsea vs Barcelona, the \"It's a disgrace\" quote from Drogba was after this game), Aytekin (the infamous Barcelona vs PSG game) Busacca (sending off Van Persie against Barcelona in 2011), Moreno (the ref in the infamous Italy vs South Korea game in the 2002 WC) and Riley (United vs Arsenal in 2004 who missed at least 4 red cards) all are worse.\n\nAnd to add insult to injury Riley was made head of the referees for the Engish FA, and Busacca was made head of referees for UEFA.\n\nI haven‚Äôt seen those, a bit too young for that\n\nNaaah, Darren England is still the goat of shit\n\ni get the reasoning.. but not being banned is one thing ok, from that being able to officiate a major tournament semi-final is like a bit of a stretch\n\nThe bigger issue isn‚Äôt the historical match fixing but that he has had a direct spat with one of the England players very recently. Huge conflict of interest. Completely mad appointment from UEFA. They could have got almost anyone and it would not be a story but there is no huge pressure on the ref because any dubious decision will be scrutinised a lot more heavily\n\nBielsa was right.\n\nEngland getting the excuses in early\n\noil selective merciful rain axiomatic touch secretive cows attempt whole\n\n *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev)*\n\nThese dudes shouldn't be allowed to ref professionally again. Find another career bro.\n\nSo wait‚Ä¶ Jude Bellingham actually called him out for match fixing n now the English and Holland team have to deal with this numpty.. some1 night is ending badly‚Ä¶ \n\n\nBTW WHERE IS MOLINA‚Ä¶ he was by far the best REFEREE.. PLAYERS WERE SCARED OFF HIM.\n\nGuys, this was almost 20 years ago and he was found guilty of taking a bribe from another ref (300‚Ç¨). The other ref was banned for life and Zwayer, the ref for the Netherlands - England game, was found guilty and it was dealt with appropriately.  \nSince then the german football association and the UEFA have both had an eye on him and both decided to clear him for all matches.  \n  \nAnd the  Bellingham thing was 2021 and Bellingham was in the wrong, not the ref in that situation.  \n  \ntl;dr:  \nRef played a minor role in a big match fixing scandal, was found guilty, was dealt with; has been cleared to ref matches for 20years by DFB and UEFA.    \nThere is no scandal here now.\n\nThere is, though.\n\nZwayer did his time for his crime, but should not be allowed to referee anymore. Here in the Netherlands there is the so-called \"verklaring omtrent gedrag\" (declaration about behaviour\". If you have been convicted for something there are certain jobs you just can't do anymore. For example, if you are convicted of financial fraud you can't work at a bank. You can work numerous other jobs, but certain jobs will be off-limits. And there are many more categories. I don't think a ref who was convicted for matchfixing should be allowed to be a ref at a big international tournament. He can do a lot of other jobs, just not this one.\n\n20 years or not, you wouldn't really feel comfortable playing a match with such a ref thats capable of accepting bribes.\n\nRuins the integrity of the job having such a stain on record.\n\nshame plants bewildered flag numerous theory memory rinse tub repeat\n\n *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev)*\n\nBellingham wasn‚Äôt in the wrong.\n\nNo referee involved with match fixing should ever be allowed to officiate again.\n\nHe filled a criminal case against Jude. No matter who you think was right it wrong, surely there's many better options to officiate this match\n\nHe actually didn‚Äôt, another ex- referee from the german FA did. Zwayer didn‚Äôt cooperate in the case so it got dropped within days.\n\n&gt;There is no scandal here now\n\nTaking bribes should be a lifetime ban from refereeing.\n\n&gt;There is no scandal here now.\n\nHe still shouldn't be reffing a game that Bellingham is playing.\n\nAt the very least, to avoid the appearance of impropriety.\n\nBellingham was investigated by police e over the incident, it's not like it was just a disagreement that was forgotten about after the game.\n\nAh yea, UEFA cleared him. UEFA, the definition of ethics and morality. All good then\n\nWhat's the downside to using a different ref?\n\nPlease stop with your reasoned account. This place is for hysteria only.\n\nOnly fair trade after we had to suffer through an Antony Taylor game.\n\nDoctor caught using drugs remains in their job. \nLawyer caught lying in court remains in there job. \nOh, wait, it‚Äôs only UEFA/FIFA that that‚Äôs ok.\n\nIf FIFA were any more lenient, they'd be handing out referee certificates in cereal boxes.\n\nUEFA never ceases to amaze!\n\nhe should join real madrid\n\nIs he the only one? Asking for a friend.\n\nLet‚Äôs return the present to England‚Ä¶ oh this isn‚Äôt circlejerk? Anyways‚Ä¶ good luck Holland!\n\nI hope he fixes a classic 0-0 match for us all, and makes several scenes that are agonizing to endure\n\nThe optics are brutal and not just for the teams but for the game.\n\nHe helped uncovering the scandal, also he was only part if the ref team from the guy that fixed the matches. They were in on it, but only as far as knowing about it and obviously receiving money to be silenced.\n\nBecause he played a role in discovering a lot of the shit going on he got another chance and obviously some teams fans don‚Äôt like him, but generally he proved himself over the last years.\n\nHe is a top referee in the Bundesliga, he has up and downs like all refs, but generally his games are good. Some fanbases don‚Äôt agree, but they are idiots that didn‚Äôt get what they want once and keep crying.\n\nHe is probably the best german referee right now and that this blows up with a bunch of fake information or at least leaving out the details is just disgusting.\n\nIts a bunch of english idiots already trying to make excuses and because southgate lucked his way into semis english media can‚Äôt criticise him and the team as much anymore, so now going for the ref before the match even started is the tactic.\n\nEmbarrassing.\n\nTbh, he should not take that shit storm, just let another ref team take over and I sincerely hope they will fuck up for england, it would‚Äôve quite deserved. For various reasons btw, not only the crying about the ref. Just fucking act like adults, maybe people would support you then to vring any trophy home at least once, i stead of being cunts.\n\nFfs.\n\nAnd he has history with Bellingham. The fuck is this decision?\n\nSorry that is fucking absurd. If you get done for match fixing it should be over. Never ref professionally ever again.\n\nSo a 90+7 PK for the England win?\n\nThey should do whatever that is necessary to ensure this match goes with any scandal.¬†\n\nWill they replace him?\n\n[removed]\n\nNo England in the final is my guess‚Ä¶ Jude Bellingham did call him out for match fixing‚Ä¶ sooooo‚Ä¶\n\nIt happend like 20 year ago if I remember well\n\nNice\n\nBut when NL did this to Romania so blatantly, NOBODY batted an eye.\n\nSomething you say can cost you 40.000? I thought this was a free country!\n\nOnly USA mate Only USA the land of freedom‚Ä¶\n\nMore interesting/worrying is when you look up his name together with Jude Bellingham\n\nHasn't he already fucked up at this tournament too?\n\nThis is revenge for the spain-germany referee.\n\nRed card for Bellingham 1st minute.\n\nThis is everything that's wrong with our world.guy should not be allowed to ref again. Disgusting\n\nThis referee has brought the game into disrepute.\n\nNo, no, no, no, no, no, he's a best, he should be a referee\nhttps://youtu.be/pRhg0-GPx6g\n\nDefamation.\n\nIs there really such a scarcity of qualified referees we need to use a referee that has admitted to match fixing ANYTIME in his past?\n\nhe brought the match fixing to light read the facts people not just what the media give you\n\nIs watching England for 90 mins his punishment?\n\nHe was never banned for match fixing . English media too as always\n\nDo you think he was paid off again after that penalty?\n\nAbsolutely disgusting how Fifa let this match fixing referee officiate a game of this magnitude! Feel so sorry for Holland! Surely Fifa could of found a referee with a better pedigree than this convicted cheat?\nBellingham publicly criticised his officiating previously and got fined (probably an hours wage?), so was he trying to convince the public that he wasn't bias, or match fixing by clearly giving the match to England with obscured and plainly wrong decisions?\nGuess what ref, you've been found out again since your match fixing since your last ban in 2005!\nIf you ref again, that will be an absolute disgrace to football! And trust me I'm not Dutch far from it, I've English blood in me and I'm raging how matches can be bought!\n\nOr even better, award England a penalty that never should have been. oh he did it, it's a wonder he could fit the massive brown envelope into his pocket. Never mind back passes, here's a backhander\n\nThink he needs banned again. Cheating bastards. Feel sorry for Netherlands, they were robbed.\n\nIf people can get your head out of Jude‚Äôs ass for a second, they‚Äôd realize he was in the wrong for mouthing off. He talks like a teenage girl on the field but people will say ‚Äúoh, he‚Äôs so humble and mature in his interviews‚Äù as if PR doesn‚Äôt come into play there.\n\nThere‚Äôs no conspiracy!\n\nAll German referee team and a match fixing ref. Just hand Netherlands the win now\n\nIt's the revenge for Taylor at Germany - Spain\n\nNow, England is mourning in advance bc they know they will lose to the Netherlands tomorrow. This happened ages ago and the ref was punished. I don‚Äôt think he will do it again. People change. As Luke Shaw said, just focus on winning instead of whining about the ref.\n\nGet the excuses in now\n\nThis ref officiated Netherlands - Romania as well, no one seemed to care about it then.\n\nWhatever, even if one side or the other bribes him it's impossible to tell and even to prove it so..."

They've knocked out the 20/21 season and will be adding the 23/24 season to the 21/22  and 22/23 seasons. \n\nIt was only the 22/23 season when Everton started to take things remotely serious.\n\nI wonder what it will look like for Chelsea.

It's only 8 which is totally reasonable. What if 7 of their keepers get hurt!?\n\nHas no one‚Äôs else considered a starting 11 that can all use their hands?\n\nYou see this is why you bring the Yanks in to own the team. Other teams will be kicking the ball around while Big Brain Boehly will have Chelsea playing rugby or American football. He's truly an innovator.\n\nIn yank sports the most important part is being tall and big. I wonder if that's why boehly likes keepers so much?\n\nRush goalkeeper used to be popular in playgrounds around the country but has fallen out of fashion to Pep-ball\n\n&gt; What if 7 of their keepers get hurt!?\n\nI'm sure in that case they would activate some obscure emergency clause that lets them buy 7 more keepers because the rule was never designed with a case like Chelsea in mind.\n\nIt's actually 39. We have hidden the spare goalkeepers in the medical department.\n\nThat figure keeps getting thrown around but it includes the youth keepers which is disingenuous. Most clubs have a lot of keepers if you include their U21s\n\nI mean, 3 of the 8 are 21 or under and one of those is 22 i a couple of weeks... \n\nSo essentially only 2 of the 8 are U21\n\nSix is still more than most teams who tend to have three\n\n&gt;Filip Jorgensen, 22, signed for ¬£21m; Robert Sanchez, 26, ¬£25m; Djordje Petrovic, 24, ¬£14m (available on loan); Kepa Arrizabalaga, 29, ¬£72m* (for sale); Marcus Bettinelli, 32, free*; Mike Penders, 19, ¬£17m (on loan) not yet confirmed; Gabriel Slonina, 20, ¬£9m (available on loan); Lucas Bergstrom, 21, undisclosed* (for sale/loan).\n\nSo no, 2 of the 8 being U21 (on September 5th) is not really disingenous\n\nNo it is completely disingenuous, not taking any BS on this. Why not say 6 instead of 8? Because it‚Äôs purely agenda-driven.\n\nEven 6 is not fair if we are being honest. Kepa is clearly on his way out. Slonina and Beach already out on loan. So you pretty quickly arrive at the 3 or 4 that are in serious contention for first team squad status\n\nBBC say 8\n\n&gt;Filip Jorgensen, 22, signed for ¬£21m; Robert Sanchez, 26, ¬£25m; Djordje Petrovic, 24, ¬£14m (available on loan); Kepa Arrizabalaga, 29, ¬£72m* (for sale); Marcus Bettinelli, 32, free*; Mike Penders, 19, ¬£17m (on loan) not yet confirmed; Gabriel Slonina, 20, ¬£9m (available on loan); Lucas Bergstrom, 21, undisclosed* (for sale/loan).\n\nbut, that was written yesterday.. it could well be 9, or more, by the time you read this\n\nMost of those money (singularly) is enough to land you starting keeper for the lower table prems, did they just straight up buying all of their competitor's starting GK???\n\nIsn‚Äôt the squad presently 40+- players - hilarious\n\num... 56\n\nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/cy4yg422zjpo\n\nWow that‚Äôs insane ‚Ä¶ how can they get away with this seems impossible without CL money etc\n\nCan‚Äôt be good for training or morale ‚Ä¶ \n\nIt‚Äôs stick piling players &amp; using as assets ‚Ä¶ ridiculous \n\nThe appeal for players to join Chelsea must be less &amp; less\n\nChelsea have set up a pre-season league where the winning team gets to be the first team for the PL, the rest are all on the bench\n\nThe Cobham training pitches must be straining to the max. Rumour is they‚Äôve constructed a crow‚Äôs nest to keep track of the first-team squad players. Got to be a veritable nightmare for the coaches and stats people.\n\nThey probably legitimately have to do a role call to make sure everyone is there\n\nThere will be a story in a decades time where Chelsea signed someone on 80k per week‚Ä¶and forgot about him. He would have been living the high life having never played or turned up for training. There‚Äôs no way you can keep track of those numbers\n\nJust hides with the u23 kids for 5 years and shaves in the hopes of passing as 22 when 30\n\nAnd still have not answered for self confessed Abrahmovic Financial fraud and doping which the new owners have self admitted.\n\nSo what was the ¬£10m fine chelsea payed right after self snitching?\n\nChelsea are still being investigated Masters came out in January 2024 with a statement that it could potentially take up to 12 months, City and Chelsea are both much shorter on the betting odds to be relegated than any of the other leading teams with every major bookie this season because both teams fates  are yet to be decided, don‚Äôt shoot the messenger! \n\nhttps://www.football.london/chelsea-fc/news/chelsea-ffp-investigation-confirmed-new-28454957.amp\n\nMaybe my tinfoil hat is on too tight here, but I think that will be ignored as part of the deal to get that ownership transfer done quickly.  I also think there was some agreement as part of that that the new owners would spend a lot of money in the first few years and buying all these players is the result.\n\nChelsea have also made over 100 million in player sales this summer....but don't let that affect your narrative\n\nThat's 50 pence per transfer.\n\nSure, but why so many goal keepers?\n\nThat I agree with. It's ridiculous haha\n\nAnd they made nearly the same selling their own Chelsea hotels to guess who? \nThemselves !\n\nThat's actually bad for the club in the long run because if the ownership sells then we'll lose control of our hotels. It's not some great financial cheat it's pretty stupid. It's also only a one time lever, the same as what Barcelona are doing which no one seems to complain about.\n\nPeople complained about Barca when they were on their 3-4th lever. Now they realise their position isn‚Äôt exactly wonderful. \n\nChelsea however, backed by PL finances, should never even be in that position.\n\nBut Chelsea is not in that position. The goal of a hotel sale was some quick liquid cash, same as for Barcelona with their levers, they just went to different things. It's just not a good thing the long term.\n\nWell it‚Äôs a good thing that the hotel is fucking shit\n\nCan somebody explain us how this can be happening?\n\nWe sell players too. You just don't hear about it because we're not selling Hazards and the like. We mostly sell academy graduates to the championship and lower table sides across Europe. It's very simple actually once you stop following only the headlines in the transfer market. None of them merit a Romano here we go post but they are all immediate profit in the books.\n\nAllright thanks! So everything clean or has Chelsea been officially accused of breaking some rules?\n\nThey've sat nicely inside the rules.\n\nAlthough I think there's some sideye at their hotel deal.\n\nAnd selling the women‚Äôs team\n\nYes, everything is clean. You can check the clubs own published financial records and see for yourself. Everton is guilty of breaking the financial rules in the financial records they publish yearly, and I feel for them, especially because they're being so honest while clubs like City are not. Technically, Chelsea has some investigation from the Abramovich days, but that's got nothing to do with the new ownership or their spending sprees.\n\nPSR is stupid. If the clubs aren‚Äôt in financial trouble it doesn‚Äôt serve any purpose\n\nWhy don‚Äôt Everton sell themselves a hotel ? Are they stupid\n\nThey've enough players to play 3 games simultaneously and still have subs for each team lmao\n\nI am a Chelsea fan and I simply can‚Äôt believe what they are doing. How can anyone build a team that knows each other well and create effective partnerships with so many players.\n\nRidiculous, I'd love for them to start deducting points for other team, I'm not an Everton fan but it's just ridiculous.\n\nDidn't you hear? Both Chelsea and Man City are facing tons of scrutiny due to both outright borderline and illegal financial activities. If they're convicted, 20 points will be deducted from Everton.\n\nüòÇüòÇ\n\nAs an Everton fan I might kill my self\n\nAren‚Äôt you used to bottom table fights by now though?\n\nNo my blood pressure cant another battle\n\nNever thought I‚Äôd feel sorry for an Everton fan lol\n\n115 walks free again\n\nWhen is that trial again? I am sick of seeing every other club facing punishment except for City.\n\nDon't worry, they have to wait so they can send them directly to EFL League Two.\n\nI don't know mate; I have lost hope in the PL to do the right thing with City. They might just give them a stupid fine, which City will pay and move on. \n\nI want to be proved wrong.\n\nIt seems like city did similar things as Everton but just at a massive scale instead, so they‚Äôll probably just face a massive point deduction but I doubt they will relegate them outright\n\nIt's modern society bro. Love the rich, punish the poor\n\n‚ÄúSoon‚Äù\n\nThey will just keep delaying till football cease to exist.\n\nIf I'm not mistaken, they aren't getting done because they keep sweeping it under the rug and not co-operating with the investigation\n\nThe rug in question already has several metres of mess underneath it, it's only going to get worse the longer they leave it.\n\nI hope.\n\nFor the 100th time: one has presented numbers that demonstrate they breached the rules (Everton). The other has presented numbers that do not break the rules, but there are many questions as to the accuracy and validity of those numbers (City)\n\n\nBasically City is accused of creative accounting, amongst some other things. When you think about it, it's fairly obvious why it's quite a lot harder to prove that\n\n54x Failure to provide accurate financial information 2009-10 to 2017-18.\n\n‚Ä¢ 14x Failure to provide accurate details for player and manager payments from 2009-10 to 2017-18.\n\n‚Ä¢ 5x Failure to comply with Uefa's rules including Financial Fair Play (FFP) 2013-14 to 2017-18.\n\n‚Ä¢ 7x Breaching Premier League's PSR rules 2015-16 to 2017-18.\n\n‚Ä¢ 35x Failure to co-operate with Premier League investigations December 2018 - Feb 2023.\n\nAt some point if they continue to refuse to co-operate (and obviously the only reason you do so is if you're guilty as sin) then i'd say we're going to find you guilty on all accounts.\n\nYep. And they need to prove all those allegations, hence why it's taken so long to get their case together for the hearing\n\nIt's probably taking this long because of all those \"failure to co-operate\" charges.\n\nCreative accounting is a funny spin when the emails outright admit to fraud. \n\nCan we call murder creative aging? Theft: creative trading? Rape: creative seduction. \n\nMaybe we can bring it to football rules too. Offsides: creative positioning. Studs up tackles: creative acupuncture. Handball: creative kicking.\n\nhaha love that - people love to use these soft terms for fraud.\n\nThanks! And what about Chelsea? Doing City kind of stuff or are they clean somehow?\n\nThank you, I'm fed up of the conspiracy nonsense. I believe the trial starts in a few months\n\nYou have got to be shitting me\n\n[I am not shitting on you](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=8vj9SUPyozQ)\n\nRight Everton, this time you just say \"no we didn't\", and that should at least buy us another season.\n\nReckon Chelsea could perhaps make half a dozen signings before the window closes?\n\nConsidering we've currently got a negative net spend this summer (before Neto) and will be offloading another 5-10 players then yeah, I reckon we will.\n\n‚ÄúOffloading another 5-10‚Äù\n\nSure.\n\nKepa, Lukaku, chalobah, Broja, humphries, anjorin off the top of my head.\n\nPlus the sell on fee for Guehi if he's sold and easily another 5+ players out on loan.\n\nWhy would you lot get rid of Chalobah?\n\nBecause we're run by idiots.\n\nchukwemeka, chalobah, broja, chillwell, lukaku, kepa are all for sale and the many more are going on loans. we also sold gallagher, hutchinson, an academy player (the one we sold to city), ian maatsen, ziyech and lewis hall. \n\nbut do go on\n\nWhom did Everton pissed off to get that much punishments.\n\nYou know, I'm starting to believe the FA is terrified of Sean Dyche and his 4-4-2.\n\nThese deductions are just like nerfing a character in fighting game, if you think about it\n\nShould have lined up in city‚Äôs 1-1-5\n\nFinally the premier league have the guts to sanction Everton.\n\nThis isn't breaking. It was literally mentioned in the previous deduction so has been known for months.\n\nMaybe the First ever team to start with negative points, and still not get relegated.\n\nA number of teams have started a season with a points deduction and not been relegated. There was about 6 in one season in Italy,. Juventus even got promoted.\n\n[removed]\n\nI can‚Äôt see why ‚Äúmost‚Äù clubs would want that. The only clubs that benefit are Newcastle and Villa, and maybe Chelsea. The Big 6 wouldn‚Äôt start spending way more because most of their owners don‚Äôt actually invest anything, and rely on the cash cow of the club‚Äôs revenues to pay for everything. The remaining ‚Äúother 14‚Äù clubs don‚Äôt have the capital to even compete in a financial free-for-all, which is why most of them oppose deregulation already.\n\nNo thanks - the answer to letting clubs spend as much money as they like because they have unlimited finances (e.g state funded) is not to fine them for doing so. You don't punish a team that has unlimited money, by making them pay more money. It's not a punishment and directly enables the behavior you're trying to stop.\n\n[removed]\n\npersonally i think it's totally the wrong mindset - I don't see how it would work at all with a club like city who are already dominating the league due to financial doping. You give others money from their fines you do nothing to alter the source of their domination as they can just outbid every club going regardless of money dispersed. The attitude of \"well they'll just cheat anyway\" is really dangerous for the integrity of the game. The source of their cheating needs to be regulated and punished heavily.\n\n[removed]\n\nI mean I have no issue with them being fined, as long as it comes with titles striped for the seasons they are proven to have cheated. Just like in Italy, with Juventus there's \"no winner\" for those seasons.\n\nAmerican sports teams are owned by people who are in it to make money. A luxury tax doesn't work when you've got despotic regimes, with bottomless pockets, who are in it to launder their reputation. Or when you had oligarchs in it for western notoriety and, consequently, the reduced chance of being offed by Putin for the mineral wealth they pilfered whilst the Soviet Union fell apart.  \n\nWhat a leisure activity we have chosen for ourselves, by the way.\n\n[removed]\n\nDress it up whichever way you want - if you think this would lead to anything other than Ligue 1 except with two PSG's then I can't help you. The luxury tax receipts would be less than the money lost to the TV rights bubble bursting - before factoring in the reduction of sponsorship income to all clubs outside of those selling themselves their own airline - which this would all but guarantee.\n\nIs the PSR mistaking everton for city?\n\nOr are they just horribly managed (not blaming dyche) cause even chelsea with their 50 first team players are still within psr rules.\n\nMeanwhile city go into yet ANOTHER season with 115 charges and no traction. I'm starting to think the prem are going to wait until they bring in some rule change that means clubs just pay a fine instead of point deduction and suddenly city will comply.\n\nThis is a fucking embarrassment for the premier league, I'm sorry but it's come out they're giving Manchester United special treatment, they're dragging their heels on the city investigation, the rich 6 minus a couple of them spend money at will with no repercussions and they're docking Everton and leicester for, not minor infringements, but they clearly aren't benefiting from whatever rules they broke since one's been relegated and the other has been flirting with relegation for the last 10 years.\n\nSo Man Utd‚Äôs problems were just swept under the carpet then? Nothing came about from that?\n\nGlad someone bought this up. ¬£75m washed away which would have seen them in trouble with PSR. I've also noticed the news about that has conveniently dried up. I'm not an Everton fan but I'm supporting them with this. PSR can't continue the way it is unless the so called big 6 go and form the super league.¬†\n\nPL taking the piss at this point¬†\n\n115 but their record is clean ü§°\n\n115\n\nJust a reminder they only survived by 2 points that season and the 3 teams above leeds all broke PSR\n\nEven as a certified Leeds hater, this is what gets my goat. Crying persecution about an utterly inconsequential slap on the wrist later, when they ought to have gone down then. Goodison gobshites.\n\nwhy dont everton simply postpone all investigations or prosecutions indefinitely like man city ?\n\nbecause they told the league in advance that they were going to break the rules and immediately pleaded guilty when they were charged. bit difficult to go back on that.\n\nwhy didn't everton postpone all investigations or prosecutions indefinitely like man city ?\n\nBecause they know that for their long term objectives and sustainability, kicking the can down the road and not co-operating will leave them in a worse position. They‚Äôve broken FFP rules by relatively - in terms of the sums of money that are generally thrown around in the game - small amounts, and have decided to fess up. Taking it on the chin and getting through it.\n\nCity on the other hand, seem to have broken a fuck ton of rules multiple times over multiple seasons. They know there will be a devastating impact whether they fess up now or get caught later. So they‚Äôre hedging their bets and hiding from the law for as long as they can. Worst case scenario they‚Äôre fucked in a few years when Pep and this generation are gone anyway. Best case scenario there‚Äôs a rule change they can exploit to limit damages or the league gets sick and tired of chasing them and give up.\n\nIncredible how city‚Äôs getting away with a murder here\n\nStraight stupid\n\nWhy continue to go after them when Chelsea and city are going crazy on transfers every season haha\n\nHow are Chelsea getting away with it?\n\nbit of a joke considering man united got off with 40 million\n\nI can remember some case where malaga(spain) got punished back then and weren't allowed in european competitions. Meanwhile others get punished with a slap on the wrist for similar or worse things. The corruption really turned me away from watching despite me loving the sport!\n\nGetting tired of football, nothing ever changes. Watching Man City win again and not get charged is like watching football getting buried six feet under\n\nHow are Everton getting sanctioned but not Manchester City?!?\n\nMeanwhile, Man City is still free.\n\nI realize that many charges takes time to work through, but this much time?\n\n[deleted]\n\nChelsea have made 100M+ in academy/pure profit sales this window.\n\nBabe, it's the start of the season ! Time for you to get a point deduction again !\n\nok. what about manchester city?\n\nMuhahahaha.\n\nMeanwhile Man City and chelsea roaming free for doing something everton would do in 100 years\n\nAnd they can‚Äôt run it through the legal system like Man City , why are all the other clubs being punished and Cities woes are protracted so much ?\n\nChelsea buy a league's worth of players, punish everton! I mean as a LFC lad I'm not complaining but c'mon üòÇüòÇ\n\nThis is ridiculous.\n\nbUt WhAt AbOuT mAn CiTy?!\n\nThe more they penalise Everton the more animosity they will get if Man City get away with what people think are light punishment.\n\nBut Chelsea with 45+ players have done nothing wrong and neither have city, obviously Everton need a better accountant üòÄ\n\nIt's pretty clear how Chelsea have been able to buy all those players within the rules, it's talked about constantly.\n\nHow about punishing City, Chelsea and United first?\n\nreally tired of this bullshit.\n\nif there are rules. enforce them. and make it standardized.\n\nhowever many million equivalent to how many points deduction and however long transfer ban. \n\nalso standardized points to be docked at a specific stage of the season not when its convenient for the club with nothing to play for.\n\nand also means city and other clubs violating the rule also has to be punished.\n\ntheres really no meaning to the league if random clubs break random rules and are punished at random\n\n-3 points\n\nCool now do City.\n\nAt what point will they do like city and just say no?\n\nIt looks like Everton getting their points deductions in the EPL is now a certainty every season.¬†\n\nMan city 115 charges : I sleep\n\nEverton a single offense of overspending: \"Oh I got time today!\"\n\nCough cough Man City cough cough\n\nLeave Everton alone\n\nAll the while Man City and Chelsea stick two fingers up at everyone. And then English football has the audacity to scream corruption at Serie A.\n\nLol theyre trying so hard to convince us that PSR rules are working.\n\nConsidering PSR covers 3 years at a time, all you really need is 1 baaaad year and you're essentially fucked for 3 different periods.\n\nFor example.\n\nSay you have years 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.\n\nIf year 3 is realllyyyy bad then periods 123, 234, 345 are all going to breach PSR and you're gonna get hit with 3 deductions.\n\nExcept that for Everton years 1,2,3,4 and 5 have all been 'baaaad' and it doesn't look like its going to change anytime soon unfortunately.\n\nIs this from a satire publication?  Has to be, right?\n\nNah. It‚Äôs true unfortunately, every I post is correct and valid.\n\nMan City?\n\nAnyone?\n\nfull test toothbrush hobbies telephone murky important trees plate grandiose\n\n *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev/home)*\n\nMan the PL are really out to get Everton relegated it seems. What about Chelsea and City? Where are their deductions?\n\nForest should basically get automatically relegated for the shit they've pulled off.\n\n\nHey! This sound like a bot, but this is a legit deal from me ( a latvian ex-football player who has inside info)\n\n I‚Äôm offering free bets to start, so you can see how legit my picks are. Once you‚Äôre convinced they‚Äôre solid, we can talk about sharing a cut of the winnings.\n\nNo strings attached at first‚Äîjust free bets to prove they work. If you like what you see, we‚Äôll figure out a fair deal moving forward.\n\n‚ÄºÔ∏èSites that the bets available GGBet,Synottip,Lvbet Tonybet Betsafe,casino777 e.t.c.\n\nIf you need i can send past bets that have gone through or i can keep sending you the next picks i place!\n\nLet me know if you‚Äôre interested!\n\nIf I was Everton manager after every match, I would say does the result even matter, the Fa deduct us points when they like and Man city have more charges than us pending and nothing happens, the public and premier league teams want them to answer¬†\n\nI don‚Äôt think that should happen\n\nPickford needs to save the day yet again. Someone get that man some help.\n\nThe rich getting richer, and the poor getting poorer\n\nEverton has to be one of the most, if not the most poorly-ran club in EPL. I‚Äôm surprised they haven‚Äôt relegated yet. They went downhill so fast in just a few years.\n\nthe onerous penalties for everton and complete lack thereof for man city is well past the point of farce at this point\n\nThis is happening to them, but the other blue side from London keeps signing more players like the law doesn't relate to them.¬†\n\nI can't help but feel like Everton is being targeted mostly for an alibi. Even if the investigation is legitimate, they're an easy target, unlike a certain club in Manchester.\n\nHow‚Äôs the Man City case coming along? They will be doing a Rangers if they get found guilty of them all.\n\nThey still tallying up Manchester City‚Äôs rule breaks?\n\nAs is tradition\n\nFfs not even an everton but City with 115 still getting nothing\n\nDeduct points from everton but not City\n\nThey keep charging Everton but let 115 FC walk free, it's disgusting\n\nAnd still nothing for City, the Premier League are corrupt.\n\nBart meme: stop it, they‚Äôre already dead\n\nThat's not Bart. That's just a random child.\n\nSheesh, Everton. Cheat much??\n\nThey can't catch a break\n\nWhat about 115 FC?\n\nWhy does it feel like EPL want to kill off the smaller teams, I feel like they have a vendetta against them.  It's fair for the smaller teams who are trying to compete.  Of course when Man City and Chelsea do it it's perfectly fine."

Unfortunately for The Prem, we have played in the top flight for longer than anyone and it's staying that way.\n\ntoo stubborn to die makes a great story tbf\n\nJokes on you, in the prem history Everton are one of 6 to never be relegated! You meant too flight\n\nDude. C'mon I just wasted a mouthful of cider\n\nI used to say Abramovic‚Äôs Chelsea ruined football with their spending\n\nThis new Chelsea is like a parody of Abramovic era Chelsea\n\nYou can‚Äôt ruin football if you don‚Äôt win though\n\nMisconception. They‚Äôve inflated the price of players and salary to a ridiculous level. They are not the only ones, PSG also responsible for this\n\nPrices, yes.\n\nSalary - they've actually been very good with giving out smaller salaries with most of them tied to incentives. I think majority of the team under 100K weekly.\n\nThey currently have 43 players registered in the first team. 43 salaries even managed correctly is ridiculous\n\nYou act like this is new. There was a 40 man loan army under abromovich of all first team players\n\nthere‚Äôs a lot of yearly increases, right? my understanding was they targeted young players and offered contracts that would grow as they did\n\nI don‚Äôt believe so, I think they‚Äôre all linked to champions league and things like that. I don‚Äôt think they increase for longer years, that would be terrible if someone stunk and rode it out lmfao\n\nand Barcelona, and real Madrid...\n\nThe only Giant club that didn't inflate football to shit even if they could was Bayern. But they ruin German football in their own way.\n\nNot a big fan of the Bavarians either, but you can't just expect them to willingly bottle the league. Not their fault everyone else is usually not up to par...\n\nIt‚Äôs hard to be up to par, when Bayern sign everyone‚Äôs best players. A few years ago Upamecano and Nagelsmann came from Leipzig. This season Tah is already in, among others\n\nWell, those clubs could always not let the players go. But when money speaks louder than squad depth and talent...\n\nWith lewy there was no choice, and then release clauses. And the manager often gets no call in it, money lines owners pockets. Fsg had to be yelled down by Klopp for him to get alisson and VVD\n\nWell, obviously I wasn't talking about any manager. It's all the owners' fault.\n\nSome managers do make their transfer sales, against clubs wishes sometimes. You think chelsea owners wanted to sell one of their better midfielders (Mata. 2 chelsea POTS awards)\n\nBayern couldn‚Äôt ruin football, they never had that much money. It‚Äôs why moments like 2013 were miracles\n\nBayern just ruined everything German football\n\n[Ah yes, just look at chelsea inflating all of the salaries.](https://www.capology.com/uk/premier-league/salaries/)\n\nInflating salaries isn't just increasing the wages of the best players. Chelsea is overpaying (seemingly) mediocre players. That makes players of both a similar and a higher level demand more when going to negotiate.\n\nA lot of average players are going to look at Mudryk making 5.2m/year and want that or more based on his peformances.\n\nExactly this, players are getting paid a fortune at Chelsea to sit on the bench\n\nSurely Man united are the worse culprits of this. Especially with inflated fees for players during the fergie era.¬†\n\nyup, prices for sure have been skewed thanks to thus absurd spending. \n\nIn terms of salary though, ManU has a history of offering ridiculous wages and then they cannot offload the players because of them.\n\nYeah that's only gotten worse as teams around Europe tighten the belts.¬†\n\nWages 100% but I believe that's all about adding value to the club, so the players are more expensive assets. Glazercomics.\n\nSure United did make some big purchases under Fergie but they weren't that far out there and we're beaten by other clubs at times.\n\nActing as if Chelsea hasn't had more success in Europe than any other English club in the 21st century.\n\nThey‚Äôre literally talking about Boehly‚Äôs Chelsea being a parody and saying ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt ruin football if you don‚Äôt win anything‚Äù\n\nIirc, this still has nothing on the loan army during abromovich\n\nRoman damaged football\n\nCheaty ruined football\n\nEverton took the blame\n\nAnd chelsea is a literal clown\n\nI genuinely have a serious question.\n\nWhy do people say it is pay to play in America when it comes to sports. But in reality, most kids have access to play multiple sports that the school provides. And teams will scout and have players join on scholarships if they think they are good. Especially in High School and College.\n\nBut every team that wins any soccer league pays to win. Most teams spend the most win the most. In almost all cases. Man City, Real, PSG and more. Same thing in the UCL. The teams that compete in the UCL and win are the teams that have state governments who have a boat load of money they can spend.\n\n\nSo my question is, why not a Super League divided up divisions for the different countries. And all teams have shared revenue. And if a team wins their division, they will still get the same amount of money as the last place. Make a salary cap more realistic. And have more teams who spend more have a salary cap tax.\n\nBecause to get good traiing you have to pay. You can't becoming a top soccer play playing for your school you have to pay club, with travel costs a year it used to cost $4-5K 15 years ago when I played. By the time you get to high school its too late for soccer, most of your key development years are behind you.\n\nEven though teams are backed by owners, they actually belong to the communities that founded and supported them long before the billionaires took an interest. A century in some cases. They have to be listened to.\n\nAlso this idea works well in a single national league, like the nba. But to impose this on football structures already in place across Europe would have a destructive impact on teams that didnt make the jump to the socialist super league utopia.\n\nThe team that spends the most in England is Chelsea though.\n\n44 with Pedro neto... not sure if this also includes that goalkeeper they signed yesterday.\n\nKeeper has gone back on loan no?\n\nAnd they‚Äôve just signed their 8th keeper. Penders for ¬£17m. Bonkers.\n\nWe need a goalie just for pens\n\nOne for each pen of a shoot-out\n\nthats MAD\n\nAnd Neto\n\nOnly 2 proffesional games btw\n\nWait they have 8 keepers now?\n\nIs the 8th keeper Jorgensen or have they signed another one since then?\n\nAt this point they will field 10 keepers with Palmer on goal\n\n[deleted]\n\nThey sell themselves their own assets. Simple\n\nBoehly will just sell himself a small office space at Stamford bridge for ¬£200m\n\nAmortization. Don't forget a lot of the players we signed are amoritized over 8 years before they closed that loophole.\n\nBut every new one they sign and do the same with reduces future ability to do the same. They will eventually run out of road\n\nYeah, but I'd imagine at some point in next season or so buying will stop (or slow down). Also will continue to sell academy players for $$. I genuinely think a good chunk of the players we brought past few years will be sold soon enough. \n\nHonestly, would love to see their books haha It's gotta be pretty interesting.\n\nAbsolutely! It‚Äôs been baffling from a footballing perspective but they‚Äôve certainly been inventive financially\n\nThat depends entirely on which team is doing it and what the vibes are.\n\nThe big rich clubs are exempt from those pesky financial rules.\n\nIs this version of Chelsea the greatest shitshow the sport ever had? Like for real, not trashtalking or anything. Was there ever a club that was lead this increadibly stupid and clearly without a plan for success?\n\nAs a chelsea fan yes this is definitely the biggest shit show ive seen lmao half the time im pulling my hairs at the decisions i see the board and boehly make\n\n‚ÄúClearly without a plan‚Äù is *clearly* just the public‚Äôs perception.\n\nIt‚Äôs obvious the new owners are buying youngsters to profit in the future if they become stars meanwhile they‚Äôre selling academy products for profit. Maatsen, Gallagher, Mount, etc. for example. \n\nChelsea owners are spending crazy amount of money but it‚Äôs clear they know how to do so by finding loopholes like the outrageous contract lengthening that caused a contract limit recently.\n\nYou cant profit unless you give them an environment to grow in. Palmer is probably the only player to grow in value since joining. Many like mudryk dropped 50% in value\n\nI‚Äôm not referring to the players in the main squad but the 3000 u18 wonder kids Boehly &amp; Co. have signed since taking over.\n\nAnd how will they develop in a shitshow environnent\n\nConsidering Chelsea has one of the best academies out there I figure that‚Äôs where they‚Äôll develop then get loaned out and or make the first team. \n\nPlenty of quality came from the Chelsea academy so I doubt it‚Äôs a ‚Äúshitshow‚Äù for the youngsters.\n\nAre you joking rn? Are they spending hundreds of millions on academy players?\n\nNot exactly profiting by spending ‚Ç¨20m on a talented keeper unless they become *truly* top class. That's just shit business.\n\nit distorts the market such that clubs become desperate for GKs and chelsea can take them for all theyve got\n\nEh, most every club has more keepers than they'll ever reasonably play. I mean, 3rd and 4th choice keepers are essentially there for training. Supply is high enough that Chelsea buying enough for 2 clubs is not going to have any effect.\n\nclubs dont just want any gk. it depends on who they are and who they play for and being a 10 figure transfer to the premier league boosts their profile from the off\n\nIf they're evaluating a player's previous purchase value, they'll also be evaluating the fact that they were bought by Chelsea. It's just an awful business move.\n\ni can absolutely guarantee you they know better what to do with their money than some grotty little reddit freak\n\nUsername certainly checks out, that was really pathetic and out of nowhere. Enjoy your angry little life.\n\nBut if players aren‚Äôt playing and they stagnate their development, how are they going to profit?\n\nTake a glimpse at the loan army &amp; the players chelsea are sending to the parent club Strasbourg in Ligue 1.\n\nYou can only loan 6 21+ players out at a time\n\n&gt;clearly without a plan for success?\n\n\n??? There is a clear plan. Whether you agree with it or not is a different story.\n\nThe only plan I see is to generate more money through player sales, but I never see this money invested into actual improvements into the squad to win anythin. Thats why I said plan for success, not no plan at all.\n\nCause there seems to be a plan to make money but thats about it\n\nAren't they owned by an investment fund? The literal point of them is to make money. \n\nIt shouldn't be allowed, it's disgusting and I would say, it brings the game in to disrepute imho.\n\nIt's not good for the game, it's not good for the Premier League and it's not good for the players that are just being treated as commodities.\n\nMan City are a greater shitshow for ruining football for everyone else. Chelsea are an ever exploding clown car.\n\nBarcelona and man utd are contenders, the former especially. The thing that sets chelsea apart is the sheer number of players that theyre signing.\n\nChelsea got more keepers than man Utd defenders lol\n\nhow is that even possible thry surely have to sell players to register new ones and send handful of them on loan too\n\n[deleted]\n\nAren't there only 6 loan slots?\n\nOnly to other English clubs I believe.\n\nYou're making half of these people up\n\nFofana, Broja and Lukaku will be sold. Kepa and Casedei probably too.\n\nLukaku is up there with United and Pogba for an example of disastrously expensive academy products\n\nImagine spending 80M on a young CB to build around only to sell him two years later.\n\nI read it as Fofana the forward that would go\n\nDatro Fofana, not Wesley\n\nthe limit in EA FC is 50 I think. I really want them to go over now. Just wanna see something. üòÇ\n\nAn average of 4 players per position is sheer madness. It is impossible to build up any degree of familiarity with your teammates.\n\nOn transfermarkt, Chelsea got 6 (six) keepers. But don't let that fact distract you this season, Mudryk will evolve under Lakaka tutelage.\n\nIs there plan to own all the players leaving the other teams with just their youth players left?\n\nCan't lose if you buy everyone else's players.\n\nwonder if chelsea is gonna make history by getting 2 managers to managed their overly bloated squad. bringing competing on all fronts to another level.\n\nIdk why we insist on being a joke üò≠\n\nCome on buy many more. 50 is not so far\n\nI want to know that do they need more than a bus to fit all of their players?\n\nThe average coach bus fits between 30-60 passengers.  I assume they probably have a more comfortable set of busses so maybe one bus just for the team and another for the staff would suffice.\n\nDouble deckers to all the games obviously\n\nHe could literally almost field a different 11 for every cup competition they're in.\n\nThat‚Äôs another points deduction for Everton then\n\nDoes Boehly thinks it‚Äôs American Football.  Has anyone told him?\n\nsombody warn him FAST\n\nEveryone knows they‚Äôre shadow backed by the Saudis now I hope. What are they cooking\n\nThere‚Äôs a limit in terms of squad size for the prem or European tournaments.\n\nBut Chelsea could have completely different squads for Prem and Conference League. Is that even allowed?\n\nI don't think you're obliged to play the same players as in your domestic league, though I'm not sure. But if they want to be competitive, there's going to be an overlap. Playing 2 completely different squads is not going to work for Chelsea.\n\nToddler Tod with endless cash in a sweet shop.\n\nthey should start up Chelsea Abortion Transfers FC and compete in the Championship w/o promotion\n\nSeriously, how are there no FFP concerns?¬†\n\nEvery time an FA accountant spots something dodgy in their book keeping, they hire him.\n\n\"And the transfer window is not over yet\" is the key part. They've been using players in preseason games for Maresca to get an idea of who fits. Then a lot of players will be sold or loaned over the next few weeks.\n\nAh yes, a normal and properly run club then.\n\nDo people even care about Chelsea's signings anymore? Are they even excited when they see a new signing?\n\ni mean buying out the league probably a more viable strategy than what they tried last year\n\ni‚Äôm sorry that‚Äôs fucking insane.\n\nI love how they‚Äôre cluttering the new managers brain with all these players. This season will be a blast!\n\nHow many are allowed to be registered for the premier league season?\n\nCome on 50. Antony for a couple of water bottles and he's yours\n\nBumbling idiots\n\nRookie numbers Boehly\n\nMaresca's in for a tough season\n\nIt‚Äôs called squad rotation for a congested fixture schedule. Look it up! /s\n\nyea right having an avrege of 4 (FOUR) players per positon is not called that\n\n/s for sarcasm. That club is a mess.\n\nnow your making sense\n\nI thought it was closer to 50 at the last count. I think maybe some of the players go into the under 21s maybe which is why it's 'only' 43. \n\nI counted about 10 goalkeepers but I think Slonina and another couple are in the U21s.\n\nLukaku top5 player at the club. New management try him again?\n\nChelsea has an NFL roster for a squad\n\nHalf of them are academy and going on loan/being sold\n\nIt's very easy to not see that from clickabait headlines like this\n\nLooks more like a damn MLB Roster, mate.\n\nI‚Äôm ready for my club to go bankrupt or get penalised to oblivion ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\n\nHow many teams are they planning to field?\n\nThis implosion is quite funny to see\n\nHate us cuz they anus, we‚Äôll spend 2 billion don‚Äôt fucking dare us. \n\nRhyming coincidental.\n\nOkay so FFP is doing shit but we‚Äôre keeping it, putting a cap on hoarding players it‚Äôs a no-no. Noted.\n\nI believe we have 41 and are currently attempting to sign 3 more obviously there will be outgoings as well.\n\n&gt;And the transfer window is not over yet.\n\n\nThat's the point. There will be many outgoings and loans still to come before the season starts.\n\nExcited to see if you‚Äôre right. They have 6 days\n\nwe don‚Äôt have 43 players in the ‚Äòfirst team‚Äô squad\n\nHow are they getting away with this? How can this be \"in line\" with the rules?\n\nThey can do a 4 team tourney literally in house‚Ä¶  crazy !\n\nHonestly, this guy is an absolute tool. He's literally just playing Championship Manager.\n\nChelsea is just a football manager experiment YouTube channel irl\n\nü§Ø\n\nThanks Geoff! More obvious statements soon I hope!\n\nWhen did we start including players who aren't actually in the first team squad in the first team squad?\n\nHOW GREEDY!!!!\n\nIs ffp aplied to salary?\n\nHas this arsehole uncovered a new loophole where CFC can field 20 players?!\n\n8 goalkeepers on the books\n\nOf which they‚Äôve signed 5 of them in last two years\n\nLike whats the point\n\nI hear they all wear name tags at training\n\nI don't know why people act like this is new. In the abramovich era it was called the loan army for a reason.\n\nThey are still going to keep buying more until the transfer window is closed.¬†\n\nFelix Magath is that you?\n\nBohleys been playing a bit too much fm\n\nrussians need at least x5 people to perform normal\n\nRookie numbers\n\nSo just out of curiosity how is this club not in trouble for FFP or balanced books, I know they are not publicly traded but they are spending millions dollars on average players and FIFA or UEFA doesn't do anything to them\n\nBasically me in FIFA\n\nChelsea be like, \"we signed player x so you dont have to, here's our review\"\n\nChelsea need to be investigated, Clearlake are using the club to asset flip players for on the book profits and hoarding them with full knowledge they‚Äôll be transfer banned.\n\nHonestly disgusts me they‚Äôre allowed to even register players at this point.\n\nAbout to become an NFL roster\n\nCan someone explain wtf are they doing\n\nCan someone give me an idea that I have my fifa mobile user name \"messi\" in how much can I sell it\n\nThey are preparing for hard life in League 2.\n\nChelsea can field two mid-table teams now\n\nOne more player until a full squad. That's a good start for the blue lions\n\n22 in offence, 22 to play D\n\nReady just in time for this fall's NFL season\n\nCoach Maresca has his work cut out, after drafting Conor Brady out\n\nThey can soon create their own league with 4 11 player teams if they sign couple more players\n\nFinally Chelsea will win something\n\nYesterday, someone said ‚Äúchelsea is like unsupervised child in a sweet shop‚Äù and I‚Äôve only just recovered.\n\nLooking like my football manager roster count\n\nAt what point are Chelsea going to be absolutely fucked? Even with all the rule bending selling things to themselves and giving out 100 year contracts, they must be sailing close to the wind given how shit they have been\n\n11th position at end of the league!\n\nJoke of a club\n\n[deleted]\n\nSo we're the current laughing stock of the world, who the fuck cares? lmfao. If things start to click and we become a strong team we'll very quickly go from laughing stock to everyone being mad that we spend $$ and what not. \n\nCrazy to let other fans dictate how you feel about your club.\n\n[deleted]\n\nNo offense man but I completely disagree with what you wrote and it makes you sound like a plastic fan. I'm also a non-european fan who started watching the same time as you. I think it's crazy after 12 years to be like eh doesn't feel right anymore since we're losing. That's just me though, I still love Chelsea and despite many people shitting on us I think we're going to be just fine in the long run and that we'll be back to winning. \n\nWe went through a complete club rebuild with these new owners. No more buying players in their prime for 300K a week, we want young that will grow into their prime together. All these players who get written off are under 24 and have long careers ahead of them. It's easy to let the other fans talk shit and act like we're just shit but reality is that if we won 2 games against the bottom clubs last year we would've finished top 4. I'm not saying we'll be there this year because i worry with another new manager but I still have faith and will be supporting them week in and week out.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with appreciating other clubs for being good, but if you're going to jump from club to club might as well just say you're a fan of football instead of one team.\n\nDont forget, over 100 million for ar subpar Fofana :)"

I wish him a speedy recovery.\n\nWait how was he injured?\n\nTwo heads bashing together on corner\n\nTchouameni went in way too hard for a header he had literally 0 chance to win at very end of the game, and headed hard into the side of Le Normand's sidehead. absolutely ridiculous challenge for the ball from him.\n\nWtf??? That's not what happened at all. They both challenged a cross??\n\nTchouameni came in way too late for that cross, yes.\n\nliterally, Llorente got a straight red for being late in to a block (causing him to plant his studs badly into Fran Garc√≠a's ~~Beltr√°n's~~ ankle), which was genuinely the exact same kind of situation. the difference being: head injuries are *even worse*.\n\nMate you‚Äôre so clueless you can‚Äôt even get the names right üò≠\n\nlmao, how is that relevant to judging these situations whatsoever? and let me ask you further: which situation resulted in a literal physical brain injury?\n\nthere's been more than enough focus on head injuries and how it might lead to future health issues, that pretending \"challenges\" like Tchouameni's should be allowed. he comes in with so much force way too late. genuinely, how is that significantly different?\n\nLiteral physical brain injury as opposed to figurative mental brain injury?\n\nI have no problem with the rest of your comments, but this one is pure horseshit. Are you doubting the existence of CTE, post-concussion syndrome and a myriad of other brain issues that occur from incidents like this?\n\nLe Normand has a subdural haematoma. These kinds of injuries can lead to permanent physical disabilities.\n\nIn what way is this remotely \"figurative\"?\n\nThat‚Äôs not what he was saying Mr.\n\nhow are you missing the point this much?\n\nI'm not missing the point at all, you just phrased it stupidly trying to empathize the injury\n\nthank you for contributing with something less stupid then :p\n\nHow was that way too late? They both had a legitimate chance at the ball. If it was as you said there would‚Äôve been a legit scuffle. Atletico isn‚Äôt soft, Cholo would‚Äôve been up in fumes as would there fans.\n\nbecause they were all scared about his health. the Atl√©ti players literally went straight to Le Normand and called for medical personnel, clearly uncomfortable.\n\nbesides, Atl√©ti and Cholo has calmed down a ton since ten years ago. this is a very different team from back then.\n\nReally? I seem recall they had to stop the game this past weekend to calm down the fans.\n\nI'm talking about the players and manager, not the fascist fans.\n\nKj√∏tthue\n\nIt is\n\nUsername checks out\n\nThe fuck are you talking about????\n\nYou have no idea what you're talking about. Stop your nonsense.\n\nLmao! Dawg‚Ä¶ at least try to make it less obvious that you‚Äôre a Barca fan. Jesus\n\nlmao, make it less obvious you're a Madrid fan yourself :p\n\nand nah, I think those challenges are awful every time they happen. fortunately they don't end up in injuries this immediately bad, so they don't lead to actual discussion often. it's simply ridiculous to allow entering with that much force in a challenge like that while also having focus on how harmful head injuries actually are.\n\nSo what, you‚Äôre advocating to stop all forms of header challenges for the ball?\n\nYou‚Äôre not being realistic. Jumping in itself requires a lot of force. So how exactly do you suggest they make challenges for the ball with minimal force while jumping?üé§\n\nif you come in with that kind of speed/force for the header I legit think it's equivalent to sliding in with excessive force, yes.\n\n\"A tackle or challenge that endangers the safety of an opponent [..] must be sanctioned as serious foul play.\" does this part of the definition in the FA Laws Of The Game not cover exactly what im describing, regardless of whether it's on the ground or in the air?\n\nThere was nothing extraordinary about the speed or force that both of them came in with, it was just an unfortunate turn of events that neither of them could‚Äôve controlled.\n\nYour analogy isn‚Äôt correct cause both of them made a challenge not just one of them, I‚Äôd compare it to a striker trying to shoot the ball and a defender trying to set a leg in the way of the shot.\n\nIf I want the ball to go in with a certain speed, I need a minimum amount of force to get it in. If a defender puts his leg in the way and I kick both him and the ball, how is that my fault?\n\nLike I said earlier, you‚Äôre clearly speaking with bias and there‚Äôs no point trying to convince you otherwise. \n\nI hope he recovers well enough and fast.\n\nLe Normand was nearly stationary, moving maybe 1m out from the cross came in, barely more momentum past that. \n\nTchouameni jumped from the penalty spot, so about 2.5m (and significantly further, if not for the collision) in with the necessary force to do that.\n\none player was already there (and won the ball), the other smashed into his head. even checking the replay multiple times more I don't see how that's a biased or inaccurate summary of the situation.\n\nFor all walks of life, I highly recommend looking at a situation and then forming your opinion from that, rather than wanting to believe something, then looking for indications in the situation that support that view. This is more than just football rivalry, it's fundamental to humanity.\n\nsame back at you. call me crazy, but I really don't feel bad about caring this much about a challenge that directly caused a subdural hematoma. not when I immediately reacted to it live the exact same way I did now when watching it again days later. \n\nI'm curious, have you actually looked at what I've said without the bias of the downvotes affecting your view? because I know for a fact most don't (that's why in significant votes the actual votes are specifically kept hidden, as to not affect the outcome), and that really adds on the \"put aside your bias\" comments that constitute the main criticism I actually got.\n\npeople regularly yell about \"protect the players!\", but then when something like this happens it's all \"it's just fair challenge for the ball!\". I can fully understand and empathise that he didn't mean to injure Le Normand, but when that doesn't matter for other challenges, why does it matter here? if I could, I'd love to run through the clip with everyone and describe exactly why I reached the conclusion I did, but that's not exactly doable now, is it\n\nYou‚Äôre the guy who didn‚Äôt watch the game but is trying hard to prove himself right.\n\n0 football knowledge, huh\n\nOh shit this is even worse than I imagined\n\nDoes anyone know how long the recovery is or if he‚Äôll even play again\n\nProbably similar to Raul a few years back?  Hard to say without knowing the severity... but it sucks for a CB, probably if you were to ask a doctor he should never complete a header again.\n\nWell that sucks hopefully he makes a full recovery\n\nFrom a pure medical standpoint no one should ever header a ball\n\nTrue\n\nAs a Wolves fan that sounds like a carbon copy of what happened to Raul. Sadly he was never the same again despite returning to playing football. Sideshow Bob has a lot to answer for.\n\nRail Jimenez had a major TBI with a skull fracture that required emergency surgery.\n\nYeah, it was a much more violent collision too.  Amazing that he is back playing\n\nFor a second there I thought you meant Madrid‚Äôs Raul lol. But yeah he was a 40 mil striker before the injury\n\nMaybe heading the ball should be banned.\n\nRealistically yeah, but that won't happen.  It's a big part of the game.\n\nIt might happen‚Ä¶. I read If there are significant claims ,through players unions, and the risk is provable ,then to avoid bankruptcy they\nMight have to change rules. Have wondered how. Games would look .\n\nIt would be a long process to take it out of the game, but it may already be happening.  Starting this year the FA is phasing out heading in youth football, aimed at under-11 games and below, covering all league, club and affiliated school matches.  (Previously FA had banned headers in practice and training sessions for children under 12).  And I don't think many will argue this, there's massive links to dementia and brain conditions just from the repetitive small hits, not even taking large brain injuries into account (especially in youth and women's).\n\nBut for such a ban to make it all the way to club football and higher ages honestly I think would take \\~ 20 years.      \n\n\n\nHow the games would look; \n\nmore emphasis on taking the ball from your chest, upper body, and just taking the ball clean from the air.  Probably teams would employ more of a possession &amp; low passing strategy, low crosses, etc.  Giant oversized and tall players would be less prominent overall.\n\nYeah aware of the under 11 thing and the not practice of header, however most headers at that age are just chance‚Ä¶\n\nI‚Äôm not sure it would take that long, look at rules for offside that are changing. If it comes in, clubs will have to deal with it‚Ä¶. Be like  a new handball if imagine.\n\nI mean heading has always been a pretty fundamental part of the game, to an extent where a lot of teams heavily rely on them in offense and defense.\nAn offside rule changes tactics, banning heading would completely destroy players and entire teams\n\nI get that, was more meaning how quickly new rule changes can be made\n\nI know what you mean. Or I could see it going the other way. If a defender can't head it to clear the ball a long ball would be absolute chaos to defend. So could actually lead to more of a long ball game for some teams from the back. Crosses would be so hard to deal with too if they are dropping at the right height.\n\nWould be interesting to see the game adjust to something so huge.\n\nIt is, but things change. You just force players to control the ball with their chest more. \n\nI don‚Äôt think we lose that much if heading is banned.\n\nIt would make set pieces kind of irrelevant though no? I'm not disputing that maybe for health reasons tough decisions must be made but I think it would change a lot of the game for sure for better or worse\n\nAim lower- for the chest. Or lower , for volleys .\nI still don‚Äôt think we lose that much\n\nI think if guys were all kicking out at corners then the chances of a red card would be extremely high but tbf things change and the fact that heading the ball causes brain damage is undeniable so like you said things change and maybe that's just something we'll have to leave in the past\n\n'I don't think we lost that much' is a truly awful take.\n\nIt would change a lot. For one, defensive headers off crosses would be impossible. The way the game is now, you don't really want to lose a head height as a defender. You also don't want to bring the ball down where you are, that could be dangerous. \n\nHeading the ball into the goal would be gone, and then any high ball would be the extra time to be brought down. \n\nIt changes the relative values of ground vs air game by enough that you would notice it. Who knows what tactical innovations would follow, but history would certainly split to before and after, much like the offside rule or the backpass rule.\n\nGood first step might be treating heading the ball from corners and goal kicks the same as handballs\n\nMaybe at least send of the players who launch themselves head first into others with zero regard for whether they'll hit the ball. Oh wait, they play for real. Can't do that then\n\nAgreed\n\nthey can wear a guardian cap but it's not \"cool looking\"\n\nCaps, etc. don't do anything for your brain though.  Just like in the NFL, despite helmet technology there's nothing that can prevent your brain from smashing into the skull from a hit (even hits not directly to the head, ie whiplash, in the NFL).\n\nCaps and helmets prevent physical injury to the skull and that's about it.\n\nthey soften the blow up to 35% and reduce concussions .... it's not for cosmetic superficial injuries\n\nUnfortunately, the evidence suggests that repeated blows don't have to be at the concussive level to cause the long term brain damage (CTE) that is common in NFL players, and looks increasingly like is linked to headers in football. It's the repetition of sub-concussive hits that's the problem. Caps don't help, and may even be a problem by encouraging players to risk more blows.\n\njust imagine the bullet headers we'd get though\n\nBullet header is literally a skill assigned to Ronaldo in efootball lol.\n\nIt isn't true that helmets don't help, though.\n\nI mean, you have to define relative to what, of course, but helmet technology that reduces the force transferred into the head will help with all brain trauma.\n\nOn the basis of an individual, isolated blow to the head, yes. But the recent cases getting a lot of attention in the US in the NFL and more recently in the UK relating to rugby and football are to do with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). That's what is producing ex-players with early-onset dementia symptoms, psychiatric problems and elevated suicide risk. CTE isn't related to 'full' concussions, it's related to repetitive, sub-concussive blows. In that context, wearing a helmet isn't giving any meaningful protection, because over a career you're still taking thousands of small hits that are producing the effect, regardless of if you're saved from a handful of big concussions. Directional force is also a big factor (the head getting pushed quickly in one direction then coming to an abrupt stop), which can be exacerbated by a helmet because players can take more frequent big hits without a full-on concussion.\n\nThe NFL is having to reckon with this, and rugby is seeing it's first wave of cases appearing since professionalisation. Football is way behind them because there's much fewer repetitive blows. But that doesn't change that players are taking risks by heading balls and football associations may legally have the duty to inform and protect them (that's what's being argued in courts). That's where prospective bans on heading are coming from. And to reduce CTE risk, it does need to be a ban. Helmets won't do much to change the risk.\n\nYes, I'm very much aware.\n\nAnd improving helmets can still reduce the risk of CTE, relative to the status quo.\n\nOf course, like you said, this is about repetitive subconcussive blows, which cannot be eliminated entirely in any sport that has contact.\n\nI think it's really up to the professional players what they're willing to risk. Of course at the youth level should minimize it as much as possible (which includes improving helmet technology, awareness and education) in applicable sports\n\nThose caps will look cool as ice as soon as clubs can start getting sponsorship on them.\n\nHe got injured heading a head, not the ball\n\nI am aware.\nAnd now if he heads the ball again he might be fucked.\n\nMy point is that heading the ball is bad for your brain and ultimately, in my view , isn‚Äôt worth keeping in football now that we know this to be the case. \nI‚Äôve had enough of hearing the ball in my years playing the game, and I hope I don‚Äôt pay a terrible price for it\n\nThe IFAB is already working on it, there's a trial active at youth and grassroots level (those who ask for it) where heading the ball is punished with an indirect free kick.\n\nBut that's just so kids don't get injured. They still plan to keep heading in the adult game¬†\n\nPlayers know the risks. They put their bodies in danger in exchange for earning more money than 99% of people, soldiers and oil rig workers risk dying in exchange for money and they don‚Äôt even make a tenth of what footballers do. Should the entire sport of boxing be banned because players can end up with long term injuries? What about racing, should it be banned because drivers might end up injuring themselves in crashes? Why stop with sports? Why not ban any food product containing refined sugar and trans fat? It‚Äôs not like human beings are capable of making these decisions for themselves\n\nWhat, because something like this happens every once in a blue moon? Get a grip. I think we should go one further and ban every sport full stop because nearly all of them could lead to a head injury. Bye bye Rugby, boxing, cricket, American football, ice hockey, Aussie Rules, motor racing, cycling etc etc.\n\nLooks like we‚Äôre all reduced to watching f***ing tennis for eternity. \n\nAccidents happen in sport. That doesn‚Äôt mean we have to change them. Football has been played for over 150 years, these things will happen extremely rarely.\n\nNo because of the degenerative damage done to your brain by heading the ball for years. \n\nDo you play football ? I have , since I was 7. It‚Äôs not good for your head and it doesn‚Äôt add enough to the game.\n\nI do play football yes, have done for over 30 years. Seeing as it‚Äôs been a major part of football (can‚Äôt remember any games off the top of my head where there haven‚Äôt been any headers so to pretend it‚Äôs a minor feature by saying it doesn‚Äôt add anything to the game) I think it‚Äôs quite a weird call to say it should be axed. There are some degenerative damage cases that have been coming out due to older players heading very heavy footballs. The footballs that have been used for the last two or three decades are light years better than those old pig bladders from the black and white days. And, once again in this molly coddled age of softness, we are having people say things should be banned. Here‚Äôs an idea, why not let the people playing the sport to decide whether they want it banned? No one is making anyone play football, or rugby, or boxing or whatever sport. These are choices people make knowing there is potential for injury.\n\nThink of all those glorious headed goals we would have missed out on over the years if we outlawed it?\n\nThat's not strictly true, studies have shown that modern footballs are still damaging https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jul/22/footballers-could-be-at-greater-risk-from-head-injury-says-study\n\nYou can do this in the states and continue to be shit at football üëç\n\nI had a friend who had 'traumatic brain injury' it took.her about 3 months to recover. Obviously that's only one scenario and she ate shit straight into ice, but it can be a long time, it can be quicker, really depends on the isolated injury.\n\nI had a TBI and I never played contact sports again and it changed my personality for several years but it really just depends on the severity and how many concussions he‚Äôs had before. So basically between a couple months to never.\n\nWhat the fuck?\n\nWow a subdural from traumatic brain injury. \n\nThat's not good at all\n\nCould be worst if it was a subarachnoid injury. Medical student here\n\nSomeone paid attention during the neuro block! Take my upvote!\nSincerely, another med student.\n\nYou're right. If it's sah, that will be the end of his career\n\nJesus Christ, man. Best wishes to him.\n\nIt‚Äôs hard to argue with youth football banning and discouraging headers when you see incidents like this. Absolutely horrific for him\n\nBut this wasn‚Äôt caused by heading the ball, it was a clash of heads. And it‚Äôs incredibly unusual afaik. Any sport has an element of danger, if you remove this top level sport becomes unwatchable. \n\nIs there any evidence that heading in youth football has led to brain damage? I can‚Äôt find any, and I even saw some studies suggesting that there‚Äôs no real evidence in amateur adult football (there is some cause for concern at the top level but the evidence was not conclusive). I‚Äôve watched a fair bit of youth football, removing headers spoils the game imho and I‚Äôm not convinced it‚Äôs actually achieving anything concrete - it seems more like a policy the FA can point to so it looks like they are doing something‚Ä¶ there are literally tens of thousand of former amateur footballers in the UK and we have been playing football for many years, surely there would be vast numbers of cases linked to heading if this was a genuine issue at the amateur level? Are we just not hearing about them?\n\nMate let‚Äôs not take the piss. If you want me to take you seriously you can‚Äôt just write silliness.\n\nWhy do you think the players clashed heads? Because they were going to head the ball.  If you encourage players to head the ball then a clash of heads is a threat. \n\n \nImagine a cooking class where students are taught to use knives to chop vegetables. If two students accidentally bump into each other while chopping and one gets cut, it would be ridiculous to say, ‚ÄúThe incident wasn‚Äôt caused by using the knife; it was the clash of their arms.‚Äù The act of chopping involves using a knife, and the potential for accidents increases when multiple people are using knives in close proximity.\n\nBut where is the evidence that this is more than a freak accident that needs addressing? We don‚Äôt see players retiring from the game every week because of similar incidents (this is the first such case I‚Äôve heard about in 40 years of following football), the studies that have been done seem to suggest that heading isn‚Äôt an issue in amateur football and more work needs to be done to understand the problem even in the professional game. I don‚Äôt see the players calling for heading to be banned, contact sports always carry some level of risk and players accept that. You are arguing for a massive change to a sport enjoyed by millions and imho I don‚Äôt think the evidence is there to warrant that.\n\nUsing your cooking analogy, for example, it seems to me that you should be calling for a ban on knives in the kitchen. The accident you describe is clearly a possibility (albeit a very low probability possibility) so shouldn‚Äôt we be trying to remove all risk from cooking?\n\nJimen√©z had a similarly life threatening injury in 2020. A bit less than 40 years ago.\n\nAnd he‚Äôs back playing at the top level. Is he advocating for a heading ban in football? I‚Äôm not claiming heading is risk free, but no contact sport is risk free. \n\nVast numbers of football matches are played every week, and the majority of these allow heading. This has been the case for many, many years. If heading is a serious problem, there should be ample evidence of this by now. There have been some high profile cases for sure, but how many? Where‚Äôs the data that shows banning heading will have a noticeable impact? \n\nNote that I am no expert, and perhaps this data is out there and I haven‚Äôt found it. I‚Äôm just arguing that a knee jerk reaction that heading must be banned because of this incident is not necessarily evidence based. You could argue that we could ban football entirely and this would guarantee such injuries do not occur - I suspect you would agree that this would be a ludicrous reaction, but then it just becomes a question of where we draw the line and I believe banning heading is a step too far.\n\nWhat are you talking about? First you come out with utter nonsense about ‚Äúit‚Äôs not heading the ball, it‚Äôs the collision between players‚Äù yeah.no shit. And now this?\n\nLiterally the most common injury from heading comes from players colliding. \n\nRemember Varga‚Äôs injury at EURO 2024 against Scotland? That was an heading injury because it would NOT have happened if the players weren‚Äôt competing to head the ball. \n\nWhen I say Youth football I mean children. Young children under 15 or 16. Adults should be allowed to smash their heads together and cause injuries at their own risk. I‚Äôm talking about CHILDREN.\n\nCooking is a necessity. Heading in football is not.\n\nBut it's not about the most common injury that comes from heading, it's about the ultimate long term effects of all heading related injuries across the playing population as a whole. The arguments for banning heading in these threads are not just about banning it in youth football, they are about banning it in all football. My argument is that you need proper data to justify this  massive change to the sport - is that an unreasonable position?\n\nIf you are only suggesting banning heading in youth football, then this is a different argument, however I would still argue that it needs some justification - is there any actual evidence that for the past 100 years of youth football that heading has lead to a significant proportion of injuries?  In most of the youth football I watch (14-16 years), 90% of the players don't even try and head the ball! I would argue that banning heading at under 11 and below (which IIRC is where we are in the UK at the moment) has made almost no difference and may even be storing up a problem will will hit in a few years - when these players are actually allowed to head the ball, they will have no idea how to do so correctly.\n\nYou are correct that football is not a necessity - should we just ban it outright then? Assuming you don't think that, then the question becomes where we draw the line regarding heading. I don't think it should be removed from the game, some contributors here seem to think it should. Calling out a small number of incidents where heading has lead to a nasty injury is not enough evidence to change my mind.\n\nThis happened a month ago.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6BUMdrz4Y4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6BUMdrz4Y4)\n\nThis happened last season.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1c9j9gz/spudlud\\_nasty\\_clash\\_of\\_heads\\_in\\_the\\_everton\\_v/](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1c9j9gz/spudlud_nasty_clash_of_heads_in_the_everton_v/)\n\nYou are either lying or not paying any attention at all.\n\nNeither incident appears to have resulted in an injury like the one in this thread. Bentacur played the full 90 minutes this Sunday, just over a month after the incident, so appears to have made a decent recovery! \n\nI am well aware that nasty clashes of heads happen in football, but as I said in my comment I don‚Äôt remember cases where  a player has suffered the kind of severe injury that Le Normand apparently has - I cannot recall another player having been diagnosed with a ‚Äùtraumatic brain injury‚Äù as a result of an incident in a football match. \n\nI‚Äôm not a medical expert though - it‚Äôs possible bentacur also sustained a ‚Äútraumatic brain injury‚Äù but it just wasn‚Äôt reported as such. Are all concussions technically a ‚Äùtraumatic brain injury‚Äù for example? I guess we have to wait and see what happens to Le Normand, maybe this isn‚Äôt as catastrophic as it first sounds. My first reaction was that it sounded like a career ending injury, and career ending head injuries are not common in football as far as I am aware - that was  what I meant in my previous comment(I was not lying or failing to pay attention!).\n\n&gt;but this wasn't caused by heading the ball, it was a clash of heads\n\nAye, now clash a couple of those braincells of yours together and try to think what both players were doing when they bonked their heads into each other. [Hint: they were trying to hit the ball with their heads. Which is also known as ....]\n\nSure, but it‚Äôs still a freak accident - how many other times has this happened? Is there any indication that the players (who participate willingly) want a heading ban? As I said, tens of thousands of people have played football for many years, are there thousands of brain injured former players? If there are, I don‚Äôt see it reported.\n\nWhen Phil Hughes died after being struck by a cricket ball whilst batting, the lack of protection in helmets at the time was quickly raised as a problem and standards were changed. Recent studies have concluded that these changes would actually have made no difference, it was a tragic, freak accident that could not have been prevented (except by banning fast bowlers, which would be absurd).\n\nI realise it‚Äôs not a perfect analogy, but when something terrible happens like this it‚Äôs natural to try and fix something to make sure it can never happen again. Sometimes that is possible, but imho taking heading out of football would ruin a sport enjoyed by millions to fix a problem that I don‚Äôt think is a major issue (or at least hasn‚Äôt been properly proven to be a major issue).\n\n&gt;Is there any evidence that heading in youth football has led to brain damage?\n\nYes. \n\n[https://www.bu.edu/articles/2023/young-amateur-athletes-at-risk-of-cte-study-finds/](https://www.bu.edu/articles/2023/young-amateur-athletes-at-risk-of-cte-study-finds/)\n\nIt‚Äôs hard to be sure reading just on my phone, but I think that study found 4 soccer players with (mild) CTE out a total of 23 soccer players in the study. The vast majority of the athletes that had CTE (92 maybe?) were American football players - they are vastly different sports. And this was a study of brains from young people that had died under the age of 30, it‚Äôs not clear to me if this represents a valid sample of the population (what was the cause of death? Could the CTE be related to the early death?). I don‚Äôt think this is anywhere near enough data to make a conclusive case for banning heading in soccer, although it may be enough to suggest more analysis should be done.\n\nThis man has 0 deductive reasoning\n\nthis is not good\n\nHonestly, his career is more than likely over\n\nNot it is not.\n\nI really hope he recovers well, that sounds terrifying\n\nHe'll probably never play again.\n\nThere is way too much medical misinformation in this thread. If you don‚Äôt have medical training, please stop commenting about speculation. He will be fine and there‚Äôs intervention needed for his bleed. I would expect him to train within a month or two.\n\n&gt;there is way too much medical misinformation in this thread \n\n&gt;I would expect him to train within a month or two\n\nGod I love Reddit\n\nI took care of a collegiate football player in ICU who had a subarachnoid hematoma, arguably worse than subdural. He was back in training in 4 or 5 weeks.\n\nNice, I had a tbi and had a complete personality change and migraines every day for three years and I had no hematoma. Every brain and every brain injury is different. You should probably know that if you work in an icu\n\nYou are an anomaly. And I‚Äôm sorry that happened to you.\n\nRight. That's what I was saying¬†\nSubarachnoid injury would have been worse\n\n\nAll the have to do is evacuate the blood, make sure the middle meningeal vessels are closed up and good to go. And luckily, because it's usually the vein, there isn't a lot of pressure with blood loss\n\n\nMe revising on Reddit üòÇ\n\nImagine all the hard work you did to get to this point of your career. And it's all gone because of a split second collision\n\nLife can sometimes be really unfairüò¢\n\nI think that means he suffered a trauma to his brain, the article says he developed a haematoma in his skull. Due to the impact.\n\n&gt; I think that means he suffered a trauma to his brain\n\nThanks, I had no idea what \"traumatic brain injury\"  meant\n\nIt's an AI bot\n\nHow can you tell?\n\nTraumatic brain injury simply means, he had a brain injury and the cause of it is trauma.\n\nThere's a few layers that covers and protect the brain after the skull. He has bleeding between the layers.\n\nJesus christ man\n\nGod help him\n\nHope for a speedy recovery. That news really sucks.\n\nGet better\n\nImagine all the hard work you did to get to this point of your career. And it's all gone because of a split second collision\n\nLife can sometimes be really unfairüò¢\n\nGoddamn. Hope he recovers fast¬†\n\nThis sure sounds like an injury that effectively forces him to retire early.\n\n\nSo sad to hear.  It‚Äôs no joke, get better first! The Crash Reel https://g.co/kgs/9Xpw2Jo\n\nsad news\n\nIs there any update on him yet?\n\nThe result of trying to argue with Vini\n\nThis CL and the Uefa schedule is a threat for players bodies. Honestly, they should do a massive strike.\n\nThat had NOTHING to do with the workload though, he went for a header and they clashed heads. It can happen even if you play 10 minutes every 10 years.\n\nThat's sad for the player ‚òπÔ∏è\n\nWhat does that mean is this injury like Eriksen had?\n\nDidn‚Äôt Eriksen have a heart attack\n\nTraumatic brain injury is just a phrase we use to medically describe someone has had a serious injury to their brain.\n\nThere's lots of different causes, direct impact from an object, direct impact from slamming your head on the floor, concussive from being jolted around at high speeds (like a car crash).\n\nTheres different levels, a \"mild\" TBI is known as a concussion. You typically get photosensitivity, headaches, vertigo and dizziness, short term memory loss. These are fairly common in combat sports and typically take a few days to a few weeks to clear.\n\nA moderate to severe TBI can be permanently damaging. Coma, internal haemorrhaging, blood clots in the brain, permanent damage to a part of the brain, permanent memory loss and significant loss of motor function or paralysis, loss of speech/sight/hearing etc.\n\nDisclaimer: I'm not medically educated just done muay thai for years and got a few concussions when competing\n\nMy gf had a moderate TBI. One of the most terrifying moments of my life was witnessing it and the uncertainty that came after.\n\nA lot of people have a hard time understanding what a TBI is because there are so many variables like age, type of impact, and luck that dictate the severity of the injury and prognosis. TBIs are not one thing in particular and many people will have different experiences. The comments here suggest a myriad of outcomes but it‚Äôs such a dependent injury and we won‚Äôt know much until a week or more after the initial injury how the player responds and their likelihood of playing again.\n\nAs for my gf, she had a brain bleed. Her speech took nearly 48 hours to come back to conversational and two weeks after that to seem ‚Äònormal‚Äô again. She couldn‚Äôt walk on her own (like her strength was sapped) for the first few days. Even when she began walking on her own, she needed help on staircases and in the shower for over a week. Headaches, nightmares, and confusion persisted for a bit, but her longest symptom was vertigo which didn‚Äôt disappear until after 4 or 5 months. 4 years later, she has no lingering issues, but when someone has a TBI, they have a much larger chance of getting one again. That fear persists.\n\ni thought Eriksen was heart issue and not brain?\n\nDifferent. This is brain trauma and bleed. \n\nErikssen had cardiac arrest\n\nEriksen had a heart attack.\n\nthey‚Äôre not the same type of injury but both are very serious\n\nThat‚Äôs a lot of words to say ‚Äúhead injury‚Äù\n\nJust like getting your leg amputated is just a fancy way of saying \"stubbed toe\""

I hope someone is checking on him at the moment. \n\nI lost my career suddenly not that long ago. Health reasons not this. And it was devastating. Took me ages to get over it. I blamed myself even though I knew it wasn‚Äôt anything I could have avoided.\n\nThis guy has no one else to blame. It‚Äôs all him. The weight of this must be immense.\n\nAnd it‚Äôs all so public\n\nYeah I did mean to mention that bit too. My bad. Adds another layer. If he has kids just imagine what their life has become with this all over social media.\n\nAnd there's a lot of people happy for his downfall. Probably doesn't help...\n\nYep. The moment this news broke I thought who is out to get this man? Like, he loses his job fair enough but it's starting to feel like a feeding frenzy.\n\nYeah when it's open season to shit on someone publicly its so damaging to their mental health, Caroline flack comes to mind\n\nYeah 100%. It‚Äôs nice to see more people are talking about this though.\n\nFeels like it‚Äôs being pushed by the media companies who have bought the stories. And I‚Äôm seeing lots of discussion about this side of it which is great too.\n\nHe's been sold out by someone he thought was a friend too, probably for fuck all as well. Someone who I would guarantee has done exactly what he's outing Coote for; his story is that he got invited to do drugs with him, he's definitely done drugs with him before.\n\nDifference is Caroline was a domestic abuser. It's still sad she killed herself but David doing some Coke isn't hurting anyone but himself.  Don't try and compare the two.\n\nHope you recover!\n\nGive it time and stories will make him referee Diddy\n\nIt‚Äôs actually quite sad. Who the fuck thinks to leak this shit.\n\nExactly- I can tell you for a fact first hand Sun journalists are not immune from doing coke.\n\nNothing wrong with being a fan of lily white.\n\nOnly a referee would use a term like \"drugs party\"\n\nyeah, I think most people would just call it a ‚Äúparty‚Äù\n\nWe might call it a party, party. \n\nLike, are you going out? Or are you going out, out?\n\nI have this friend who would say \"Do you wanna come to this party? It'll be *proper* like\" then stare at me real intense like Super Hans from Peep Show\n\nI only went to the shop for some milk, now I'm out-out!\n\nI just call it life (I have a crippling opioid addiction)\n\n\nJk\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to have pills, powders, smokeables‚Ä¶all of the kinds of drugs.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúCan I have a few drugs please?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThese Are mine and I want to take it all, so got to be a no‚Äú\n\nOr a shit newspaper. Most of the quotes in the article sound fake as fuck.\n\nAccording the the article it‚Äôs his ‚Äòpal‚Äô calling it a drugs party, which suggests to me that the reporter who paid the ‚Äòpal‚Äô for the story was very keen to impress upon them that referring to it specifically as a ‚Äòdrugs party‚Äô would give it more impact.\n\nSeems a bit of a nonsense story tbh\n\nYou are cordially invited to ny drugs party. Starts at 9. There will be drugs provided but please feel free to bring your own and mark them accordingly. D Coote ü§ò\n\nThis is only the tip of the iceberg for the PGMOL.\n\nPraying that David Coote just says fuck it and releases the PGMOL ref group chat and burns it down with him\n\nPlease üôè the man would complete redeem himself for getting rid of Anthony Taylor and co\n\nPaul Tierney too please\n\nHe would go from zero to hero by doing that and I would love it if he does.\n\nI suppose thats why the likes of Mike Dean and that Gallagher twat, haven't exactly been burning bridges with him. Maybe he has some dirt on them too.\n\nI guarantee PGMOL knew this stuff was happening.  Every supporter knows there are certain refs that are bias towards certain clubs.  There's know way you can't growing up and supporter for s club.  Those kids geow up to be refs .  They will have bias regardless of what the PGMOL says\n\nNow this would be absolutely legendary, get rid of the the lot of them\n\nWe can only hope.\n\nReally wonder who he pissed off. Clearly an organized effort to ruin his life.\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if it's some kind of blackmail, given everything is being systematically released in drip feed and getting worse and worse. Especially since it's during the international break where it will have center stage in British news\n\nThis is just how the press works. Someone will have offered the video, got paid. The press will drop feed stuff to keep the story going. That‚Äôs just the news business. No need to assume a conspiracy. All of this is just tabloids doing tabloid things\n\nThe coke video was DM‚Äôd on IG to (I think) Stokey. Seems to be totally unrelated to the other video and he would send these out often while off his tits\n\nI think you are right.\n\nYeah. I suspect his \"bad decisions\" were the result of blackmailing\n\nEx wife or scorned lover maybe? Or someone is releasing these stories to distract from something bigger.\n\nOr gambling syndicate that has much worse stuff to release and wants to remind him to stay quiet.\n\nA friend suggested to me that he'd upset Liverpool fans who'd witnessed him slagging off their team, whereas I argued he'd likely caused most upset by getting Ten Hag the sack. So either way, we agreed that he'd upset Liverpool fans.\n\nIt certainly seems like he laid the foundation for ruining his life all by himself.\n\nBecause lots of people share this kind of sentiment, it's very easy for a bunch of assholes to just pin everything on one asshole, use him as a scapegoat and move on. \n\nI mean, look at this thread. Everyone is having a great time making fun of and shitting on him. How come, if organising a drug party is so bad, no one is questioning who else was at the party? People make it really ready for those in power to use the media to their advantage\n\nIf we ostracised everyone who said stupid shit after too many drinks or who ever got high on an illicit substance, everyone would be a hermit.\n\nYes, I've said/done stupid shit in my time, but nobody will ever see a video of me slagging off my clients or snorting coke and I earn about 65% of what Coote does.\n\nI honestly wish him the best, but you can't have this type of unprofessional shit going on and hope to hold a position of responsibility. It's all down to his bad choices; he's not a teenager.\n\nHe did some gak. Big deal it‚Äôs the UK, there is some in virtually every pub in the country. \n\nIs his reffing biased? No. Does he do a bad job? No.\n\nThe bullshit people come out with about referees just shows they aren‚Äôt really football people and have no experience of the game. \n\nCoote maybe should do some charity shit and get a fine for the German thing and then just be forgiven.\n\nI wrote he laid the foundation himself. Clearly someone is having the time of their life leaking this shit and they‚Äôve likely partaken in the ‚Äúfun‚Äù at the time.\n\nDoesn‚Äôt change the fact that this muppet is responsible that there is such interesting material to leak in the first place.\n\nI agree with you though that we should have some fun speculating who else would have been at such a drug party. Which \n other refs and linos would be suspects?\n\nFix a game in a way that he felt would be too obvious, so the kompromat has been dropped?\n\nDrug debt\n\nMaybe someone had made big bets on him fixing the Liverpool - Aston Villa game last weekend and he failed to do it and they lost a lot of money. He has probably had this hanging over his head since it happened and this was like the last resort.\n\nIt makes you wonder how many more referees that could be involved in things like this. Maybe the referees who went freelancing in the Middle East accepted extra money and has been threatened afterwards for example. I mean, a couple thousand dollars that the referees made in salary is peanuts for them down there when they're paying hundred of millions for mediocre players.\n\nWe know who the source is. It‚Äôs an ex cricketer I think? Some lower level pro sports person. \n\nAnd he has claimed it was because he got sick of having so much proof of these behaviours.\n\nBut it‚Äôs pretty obvious he‚Äôs done it for a big chunk of cash himself. He has abused a friends trust and ended that man‚Äôs life as he knows it forever. For his own gain. With seemingly no regard for this ref or his family.\n\nThat guy didn‚Äôt release the videos. He has also been suspended in his own job for appearing in this video.\n\nDoesn‚Äôt really look like he needed much help ruining it all by himself tbh‚Ä¶\n\nHis life is soooo fucked. How fucking stupid must he be. 'Mate don't let it get out' didn't work back in the 90s when I was young, we just didn't have so much video proof, word still got around....\n\nWhat i keep thinking is‚Ä¶. What job does he get after this? Surely he cant get a consultancy role. Dont think he can go saudi after this. Does he go ref lower league italian games or go work in sports direct?\n\nHe'll no on I'm a Celebrity next year, then Dancing on Ice.\n\nYou need personality for that. This bloke is a gimp.\n\nHe's fucked.\n\nUpvote just for calling him a gimp\n\nHe could go on Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew.\n\nDancing on spice more like\n\nFucking brilliant\n\nIm a celebrity get me a line out here\n\nHe's already dancing on snow\n\nPolitics, law enforcement etc\n\nMark Clattenberg style ref consultancy role, for Olympique Marseille\n\nHe can become a plumber, bartender, landscaper etc. Those jobs would align perfectly with his lifestyle.\n\nI know this will move out the public consciousness soon enough but can you imagine how many cameras he would have in his face if he popped up making pornstar martinis in be at one next weekend?\n\nLiterally any job... It's rife across all industries\n\nMayor of Toronto might be up his alley.\n\nI feel the more important question is.. who is leaking all these stuff? An ex? A love rival? A disgrunted colleague?\n\nMaybe a convoluted combination of all three?\n\nVideo Referees\t¬£850/ game, ¬£30,000/year.\nAssistant Referees\t¬£850/game, \t¬£30,000/year.\nReferees\t¬£1,150/game, \t¬£70,000-¬£200,000/year.\n\nThey do alright.\n\nColumbian league\n\nAh yes, The British Columbia league in Canada¬†\n\nHe could have a successful career in politics, he certainly has a way with words\n\nShould be suspended and carry on being a referee. His life shouldn't be ruined for drunk comments that he made. Most of the country go home and bitch about work. Regarding drugs idk, personally I don't think it should matter what he does in his own time, if the PGMOL care brings in drug testing. The worlds gone mad with cancel culture, most work places require multiple disciplinary s, why is this so different ?\n\nIf I'm not mistaken, which I very well may be, at this level it is a full time job. He's been disgraced but not proven guilty. Just look at the very famous footballers who arguably done worse and still rack up millions. Not the same pedigree though, so he's probably cooked. Back to killing chickens\n\nA football player doesn‚Äôt have the same control over the integrity of the game. \n\nIf a team wants to play their unprofessional players, and it affects their game negatively, it‚Äôs their own problem anyway. An unprofessional referee can screw either team out of their control.\n\nI think as well there is an issue that he put himself in a position where could be blackmailed\n\nThe players are the talent, so it doesn't count. He's a mope\n\nGB news presenter or Reform UK candidate\n\nI'm not really sure how to phrase it, but it's a bit like police officers who have a bodycam on and still use excessive force on an old man.\n\nThey know it's being recorded but it doesn't matter in the moment.\n\nNah his fucking wanker of a mate or nephew thre him under the bus , did him dirty big time ngl .\n\nYeah some ‚Äúpal‚Äù they are\n\nI learned that lesson playing truth or dare back in primary school. Stuff that was supposed to be kept secret would be all around the school within a week.\n\nHilarious and depressing in equal measure. Absolutely fucked his entire career down the toilet.\n\nBoooooo‚Ä¶.. i remember when you could do a bag with your friends without calling it a drug party\n\nDavid Toote Toote\n\nI‚Äôm at a modern drugs party!\n\nThey‚Äôre taking Charlie, he‚Äôs got spliff-smoke coming out of his drug-end, and there‚Äôs someone over there smoking a crack!\n\nWhere's yer nose? It's in a jar mate. I only use heroin on a recreational basis once a month. But what about others less fortunate, less middle class than me, builders or blacks for example....\n\nAny cake there? Or Joss Acklands spunky backpack to those in the know.\n\nI call bullshit. Anyone who calls it a drugs party, has never been invited to a party before\n\nI've been to parties with drugs, but never an organised drugs party. Sling us an invite Davey boy!\n\n[deleted]\n\nThats just a party dude\n\nhis mates are snakes\n\nHe doesn‚Äôt look like someone with mates, more like ‚Äòmates‚Äô.\n\nIs this what happens when you only work a couple of hours a week and get paid too much?\n\nThere is a desperate attempt to bring this guy down. He speaks like a normal person in private. What a surprise. I'm sure every other ref talks shit in private.\n\nTaking coke is a societal normal. If he's doing it in his own time I don't see the problem. Alcohol kills 75 people in the UK every day and the FA encourages us to drink the poison.\n\nAs for this drugs party, what a lot of shite. Nobody has a 'drugs party' ffs.\n\n\"I'm thinking about having a drugs party this Friday. Would you like to come along?\". Words that have never been uttered. \n\nIt's a total stitch-up by people who don't likae him.\n\nAnd of course the tabloids are hypocritical cunts. Happy to destroy lives while laughing about it afterwards and passing the coke around.\n\nAgreed. I don't like the guy, but his  job entails him getting dogs abuse for a living, if he's blasting at the weekend fair enough. In my life experience, this is pretty standard behavior. Unfortunate for him how public this is.\n\nI've thought previously that Klopp's behaviour has been a disgrace at times on the touchline. A face like a rapid dog, screaming abuse.\n\nI think he gets a pass because he's so charming when things are going his way.\n\nIt wouldn't surprise me if most referees have called him a cunt and a nightmare to deal with.\n\nThe headline could just as easily be \"bloke texts mate from work to arrange pints for afterwards\".  \n\nAlso didn't do it while the game was on. \n\nFuckin tabloid bullshit. Fuck the sun\n\nOk making remarks about a team and a manager when you're meant to be an unbiased ref is one thing but unless he's turning up to matches half cut I can't be the only one who doesn't give a shit if a grown man has people round to theirs for afters.\n\nI‚Äôd rather not have a 40 something year old coke head who also appears to be quite thick in charge of games I waste my time and money on. Especially when the job he is meant to do requires his judgement.\n\nEnd of the day have the things you enjoy in life probably have been influenced by drug addicts of some sort. Authors, musicians, actors, film makers, players themselves. \n\nDrugs are simply rampant.\n\nMakes you feel a bit superior I guess\n\nIf you read the article it didn't actually happen, some \"pal\" running off to the sun. Obviously surrounded himself with other people who were just there for the drugs. Sad really.\n\nSomeone must be doing this intentionally to target him. More stories and videos are coming out .\n\nHe‚Äôs got one scorned lover\n\nMost ridiculous thing about this whole situation is that everyone is gonna pretend like it's just Coote that's unprofessional\n\nOn the Day of Atonement the PGMOL drove Coote out into the wilderness alone\n\nFootball fans appalled that somebody casually takes drugs and calls a football manager a wanker.\n\nThe only people who are losing their shit about this are people who never go to football matches.\n\nThe funniest thing is Redditors pretending they‚Äôre better I can bet if anyone from this site was a footballer they‚Äôd be the biggest wank stain on the planet.\n\nThe pal is a proper dickhead\n\nSomeone wants to watch the PGMOL burn\n\nWhy are they only targeting coote there's other ~~pricks~~ bricks in this wall.\n\n‚ÄúStop! Stop! He‚Äôs dead already!‚Äù\n\nAll his scummy pals running to that rag\n\nBy Monday I fully expect to see evidence that he was the chief organiser of the Diddy parties and that he canceled Firefly.\n\nThis man is lucky he never met P Diddy\n\nScary thing is that it seems a lot of people knew about this, and he wasn't hiding it. Pgmol have serious questions, and we need to be looking very deeply into all of the refs - as the entire organisation has buried this, what else is there?\n\nThe Liverpool video was bad, but I think he's really crossed a line this time.\n\nWhat do we think his next video will be? Stabbing disabled minority kids? Raping puppies? Telling people to vote Tory?\n\nLol, \"drugs party\". \n\nAlways one nobhead who turns up with a bottle of calpol isn't there?\n\nAnd won‚Äôt share\n\nAnyone else starting to like this guy?\n\nThis kind of reminds me of the Tonali situation. A lot of people were quick to say, ‚ÄúHow on earth could he do something so stupid and risk throwing away his career?‚Äù But when you look at it from a mental health perspective, maybe it‚Äôs an addiction. Perhaps footballers, constantly under the microscope of media and fans, seek the thrill of taking risks as a way to cope or feel alive.\n\nMaybe it‚Äôs the same with Coote, maybe he was trying to escape something, maybe he‚Äôs struggling with an addiction, or maybe, just maybe, he‚Äôs simply a complete halfwit.\n\nYup. I can emphatise with the mental health issue because of the nature of problems that drugs like cocaine pose, but cant just go off saying stuff like \"German cunt\" and \"we all hate scousers\" when you're a professional referee, and expect support (well except from folks with similar biases who agree with him)\n\n[deleted]\n\nSeriously how much more is there?ü§î This is really getting out of hand.\n\nHonestly, what a fucking idiot.\n\nWell this explains all the shitty refereeing in the English premier League.\n\nSomeone must absolutely hate the guy üò≠\n\nA bit of ‚ÄúDavid Coote‚Äù rhyming slang??\n\nLad wanted to do some snow and call some overpriced hoes, instead he became the laughing stock of the football fans. Ouch.\n\nDon't understand why this is such a big deal. Every Brit snorts, from your local mailman to your elected politician\n\nUnless there‚Äôs proven blackmail, this witchhunt seems a bit grim. As if the majority match going fans aren‚Äôt also coked up lol\n\nThis gets better and better. What a marvellous silly little sausage!\n\n‚ÄúHe still shouldn‚Äôt lose his job though. ‚Äú Gary Neville probably\n\nJeez I wasn‚Äôt expecting this one. I hope everyone had fun?\n\nOrganized drug party implies plenty of baking soda.\n\nGames not gone\n\nI can't lie bro this ref is doing everything wrongüò≠\n\nHe's finito, hopefully he gets some help and has some self reflection cos everytime I hear about him it's something bad\n\nMaybe he can join the Bundesliga.\n\nWe already have a 1st tier ref (Felix Zwayer) that was involved in a gambling scandal :\\^)\n\nSounds like a top lad\n\nThis guy will be working at a pub soon\n\nIt's to the point where I feel rather bad for him. His life is certainly ruined\n\nHe has a great career as an Ibiza Party Rep ahead of him.\n\nThought before about this being blackmail and it‚Äôs starting to look this way to me.\n\nLegend\n\nHow can Everytime I open reddit there‚Äôs more to this story. This is wild\n\n'I don't think it should cost the man his job' - Gary Neville.\n\n1 story leaking is funny. 3 feels coordinated and I actually feel for him. \n\nHe‚Äôs gone fro a Ref who was showed up and exposed, to a man who has had his entire life fucked in a brutal way.\n\ni dont even think hes done anything that bad.\n\nok, he thinks a geezer (who called him a liar and likes having a pop at officials) is an arrogant cunt. \n\nbig whoop - the guy doesnt manage in the league any more anyway.\n\nhis other liverpool comment was that they lost cos they were shit. not biased - just an opinion - and hes reffed them since and given them a fair go.\n\ndoing some drugs isnt ideal, but its not like hes a player. his performance shouldve been assessed anyway.\n\nWe‚Äôve heard about the diddy parties are we now going to hear about coyote parties\n\nSome mates he as .\n\nHe was high as a fucking kite in that video . Probably cocaine to say the least but yeah he is turning out to be the first character assassination of refree that I have seen .\n\nIt's \"just one bad egg\" time.\n\nThis guy is the best\n\nWell this is it , he‚Äôs done a ridiculous thing but his welfare is at stake\n\nShouldn‚Äôt have been working at all **but** still a human, public image it‚Äôs a massive toll\n\nReally starting to think he might be the most relatable referee of all time.\n\nA drugs party haha. Unlike other normal parties where drugs aren‚Äôt common at all.\n\nLook, his comments of bias means he‚Äôs not fit to referee but the pontificating about ‚Äòdrugs party‚Äô and shit, from journalists that are probably likely partaking in the same stuff themselves, is a eitch hunt. \n\nMoral grandstanding from people with little morals themselves\n\nThis is total bs, someone must have hacked his phone and just aired it all. Either that or he has the worst friends in the world. Harsh\n\nDavid Coote just keeps getting cooler!\n\nLet he who has never snorted a line of white powder with the boys cast the first stone.\n\nHe has a whole different meaning to goal line\n\nOn the hand, there are many things in life more important than football. This guy is an addict and, all jokes aside, desperately needs help.\n\nBut you can‚Äôt just go around gifting phantom penalties to West Ham and not expect the Universe to come fuq your shit up.\n\nI like how PGMOL is acting like this doesn't happen often and they weren't aware of it.\n\nWhat are we calling a 'drugs party' here? I mean that goes from a couple of mates smoking a spliff playing FIFA to diddy and a tanker full of lube! \n\nSo where's Dave party at?\n\n‚ÄúOrganized drugs party‚Äù leave it to a ref to be a nerd about doing drugs.\n\nReally the only ones who are coming to defend him of all his actions (and even starting to like him??) have their own football biases and agree with what he's said.\n\nWhat makes you lot think that other refs dont have their own biases against certain other clubs? And thus sway their decision making in their games? Just because you dont like Liverpool and Scousers doesnt mean David Coote should be left scot-free, or that PGMOL shouldnt be investigated.\n\nAs a Liverpool supporter who thinks he overstepped the mark with his comments I‚Äôm also very conscious of which ‚Äúnewspaper‚Äù it is that‚Äôs coming up with these stories. It would be very hypocritical of me to suddenly start believing everything they print after all this time.\n\nFirst hand mate, Sun journalists do coke. \n\nGot worse stories too\n\nJesus .. great mates leaking the video. Probably did something\n\nWonder how many people he can get in his kitchen\n\nSounds like a good time to me tbh.\n\n‚ÄúYoung man (living in country where cocaine use among young people is rampant) is taking cocaine‚Äù\n\nStill not corrupted like Anthony Taylor\n\nFfs, calm down Tony Montana.\n\nWho gives a shit? Honestly.\n\nSounds like David is not having a good week.\n\nAnyone who claims 'drug parties' exist, has never been on a night out in their lives.\n\nThis is a witch hunt at this point.\n\nis he going to out all his colleagues as drug addicts too\n\nWho the fuck has he pissed off, because as bad as this is whoever‚Äôs done him like this is a complete prick as well\n\nThey need to lay off it, the man‚Äôs life is ruined already. Everyone is piling on him but they probably do something similar to what he has done, without the filming yourself and sending it to people bit.\n\nWhat you doing Saturday?\n\nGoing to a drugs party...\n\nSaid no one, ever."

Hopefully they can do it. The Arsenal Invincibles talked about how difficult the last few games of the season were after they won the title.\n\nyea and they could win the treble\n\nThey could win a treble, but not *the* treble\n\nwell how do you know they are guarenteed the bundesliga and they are in the final of DFB-POKAL and they could win the europa leauge and they might also win the UEFA Super cup but you are right theyre are less chancehs of them winning it\n\nNeed UCL for *the* treble.\n\nrly? doesnt the europa leauge count?\n\nThey couldn't . That's champions league . Not just any European competition .\n\nThey aren't in the Champions' League, but Europa League.\n\nExactly . They can't win the treble . Winning the domestic title is much easier normally when you play west ham instead of man city in the quarters of Europe . Demands and pressures are totally different . \n\nOtherwise Liverpool can claim a treble in 2001.\n\nThey have a chance to win in next year .\n\nIts still a treble sister\n\nIt‚Äôs not the same. It is a treble, but not the treble.\n\nIt is a treble but its not ‚Äúthe treble‚Äù that people talk about (CL, domestic league, domestic cup). It would still be unbelievably impressive though.\n\nIt's not bro . It's three titles. In English language  yes , in football language not .\n\nWhat a side life\n\nYou are not well informed. A treble is also possible with winning europa league. It is called a domestic treble. I know it is not the same, but dude this guys just break Bayerns dominance, while playing as good as them 2013-2016. Let them have it yeez\n\nI'm really sorry to tell you this, but it's you that's not well informed. It's not a domestic treble. That is what man City won in 18 - 19 when they won the league, fa cup and league Cup. There is no European trophy involved in that at all. In English, the word domestic implies within a country and not continental. Entschuldigung, mein Freund.\n\nA domestic treble would not include winning the Europa league. A domestic treble is three trophies within one FA/League structure. Usually the League and the two domestic cups of a country.\n\nI don't know why everyone is hammering this guy, you can call it a \"treble\" if you want but it all sounds a bit silly when you admit that, yes it's not \"the\" treble but it is \"a\" treble. Why even call it a treble at all, it takes significance away from the word. You win the treble when you win the top league, top domestic cup, and top European cup. Anything else is not the treble. You can call it \"a\" treble if you want but that is honestly just dumb\n\nYou are correct, they could win a treble. Not The Treble.\n\nFascinating how people give zero appreciation on competitions which are not the Champions League.\nEuropa League and Conference May be lower qualitity but still so much fun and excitement.\n\nBut as achievements go, it's not the treble.\nIt's a treble.\nIt's a brilliant achievement none the less, but it's not the treble.\n\nLook at the teams West Ham played on the route to their European Cup, whilst fielding an Xl with ¬£30m+ players in every position. If they didn‚Äôt win the competition it would be a bit embarrassing, same with Villa.\n\nEuropa League is much harder and more competitive than the pl. hence why top teams from PL like Liverpool, Man u and Arsenal struggle in the Europa league.\n\nplease never talk about football again\n\nSure, that‚Äôs why Liverpool and Arsenal\nPlay their main squads in Europa League and somehow still suck ass.\n\nA lot of teams play their full squads in various tournaments and suck ass lmao, at the end of the day saying the prem \"sucks\" because prem teams aren't good in Europa (despite there having been 2 prem winners since 2017) is ridiculous.\n\nthey suck in Europa compared to La Liga teams. Most premtards want to argue Prem is as good as UCL, but prem is not even the best domestic league as they are almost always beaten by La Liga teams, be it prem's first or prem's 5th against La Liga's 5th. Since 2016, in The last 6 years Man City has not won only once, even Ligue 1 is more competitive.\n\nYou are correct\n\n47 if you include friendlies\n\nNo one counts friendlies in an unbeaten run\n\nyou should ask arsene wenger\n\nEven he doesn't know the answer because he was only doing it in the league not in all comp\n\n‚ÄúOnly doing it in the league‚Äù rofl. You mean the best league in the world?\n\nNot really the best league back then\n\nlol back then serie a was just as good\n\nSerie a was never good. Top 3-4 were competitive rest of the teams have always been trash. \n\nStop fooling yourself.\n\nSerie A was never good has to one of the worst takes on football I've ever read.\n\nTeams in Serie A were good. Ac Milan has had some real cheat code teams. Serie A as a whole has NEVER been good. No competition, unwatchable. \n\nFact. \n\nLove the angry Italians seeeeeeeeething.\n\nPlease go back watching sunday league, Serie A was the league during the 90s.\n\nSampdoria , parma , fiorentina ,napoli lazio ..Google 90's\n\nSampdoria, Parma, Fiorentina, Lazio, Napoli. Hahahahahahahahahahahaha\n\nWell they played the European finals and some won. Not bad for trash .\n\nYes. Cinderella stories do happen.\n\nIn pl there are 6 teams that are competitive . Big difference right ?\n\nEvery single team in the PL would win the Serie A. Total farmers league.\n\nthat's utter delusion\n\nGo focus on creating flags. You don‚Äôt know football.\n\nI'm a forest fan and I watch us every week so I can safely say you are wrong.\n\nYou are a fool.\n\n[removed]\n\n[removed]\n\n&gt;Not a brit\n\nEven worse. An Uncle Tom.\n\nIt wasn't the best league in the world at the time and even if it was i would be more impressed with a team doing it in a league that has been dominated by a single team for over a decade while also not losing in all other comp that they are in\n\nMakes sense. Be more impressed by doing it in a league where there is only 1 good team than in a league where even relegation teams will win the Bundesliga. \n\nNice one shit for brains.\n\nGreat bait\n\n100% fact. People just sad their leagues are shit. Only thing missing is some French dog telling me Ligue 1 is NOT a farmers league.\n\n1. League 1 is a farmers league, obviously\n2. Just because Bayern have been dominating, doesn't mean the Bundesliga level is low in general. There's a reason we're currently ahead of the PL in the coefficient placement for which league gets 5 CL spots next year. \n\nThe PL is a great league (I think it's the best itw), but the arrogance of PL fans with zero ball knowledge who only know their league is unmatched.\n\nDid you miss the part wher they are also doing it in every comp that they are in too or did you intentionally ignored it because it doesn't fit your agenda\n\nAlso tell me how many teams were competing for the title against arsenal at the time aside from man united\n\nThe bundeslega has many good teams in comparison to leverkuzen's level so it wasn't without competion\n\nDon't know why you are so butthurt about my opinion that you had to result to insults so i will just chuck it up to you bieng pissed off that arsenal are bottling the title again\n\nBut bieng an asshole over it won't make the pain go away tho\n\nYou mean the Europa League(reject competition) and the German cup(loooooooool)? \n\nYou made my point for me little man. Bundesliga has 1 good team and they‚Äôre a joke this season therefore Leverkusen gets to win. \n\nBundesliga as a whole is both unwatchable and not competitive at all. Never has been, never will be. \n\nNot insulting you, just pointing out how dumb your reasoning is. Doing it in the Bundesliga with only 1 good team is not at all impressive. Not even a little bit.\n\nThe team that you are competing with for the prem has just got humbled at home by the reject competition\n\nSince you seem to ignore the things that doesn't fit your agenda i will ask again what big team did you compete with to win the title at the time aside from man united?\n\nAt least leverkuzen didn't need 12 ties and dodgy penalties to get this achievement so that alone is more impressive \n\nI know that that season is the one thing that you have to brag about as an arsenal fan and that's why you're bieng so defensive about it but that doesn't mean you need to be acting like a whiny child about it\n\n\nLet it go it was over 20 years ago leverkuzen are making history while you're team is struggling against a team that hasn't even qualified for the reject copitition\n\nThe entire Prem is competitive where as the entire Bundesliga is a farmers league. You have 1 good team and a bunch of floaters who are semi decent for 1 season like your Leverkusen is right now. \n\nAlso lets not talk history please. You have none. Been around for 120 years and won like 3 cups. \n\nEnjoy your fluke of a season. All your players will be bought next season and you‚Äôll go back to competing for 13th place with Wolfsburg. \n\nBtw not an Arsenal fan but invincibles season is infinitely more impressive than what Leverkusen is doing in a farmers league and 2 reject competitions.\n\n[deleted]\n\nFacts are rude and insulting? Okay then.\n\nIt was not the best league in the world lmao. How old are you kid\n\n&gt; how is this possible(I can't imagine).\n\nIt's possible by becoming a good team quickly enough that you don't play UCL and then having the luck of the draw on top.\n\nOf course they still need to play very well, but it sure as fuck helps to have only your second midweek game against an opponent of first league quality in APRIL. \n\nAny UCL campaign at all, no matter how easy, likely would've netted them a loss of some kind already.\n\nI guess someone forgot to mention that to L‚Äôpool.\n\nLiverpool has a far harder schedule than Leverkusen.\n\nNot only do they play in a tougher league with more games, but also they so far they had a shit ton of cup games against teams of top 5 league quality, often above average:\n\n2x Toulouse, 1x Atalanta, 1x Arsenal, 1x United, 1x Bournemouth, 2x Fulham, 1x Chelsea.\n\nIn combination with the longer leagu that's already 10 more games against top 5 league opposition than Leverkusen played this year.\n\nAnd their non top 5 opponents were arguably a lot better as well. \n\nThat shit is taxing.\n\nAs I said.\n\nLeverkusen has the fortune of having been shit enough to play UEL last year AND getting an insanely easy draw in both the UEL and the cup.\n\nOf course that doesn't mean what they did is easy by any means, but it's also not in any way comparable to say Bayerns treble in 12/13, even if they go invincible.\n\nAbsolute scenes at the stadium, beautiful game indeed\n\nDoes anyone know what odds Bayer were to win the league before the season? I‚Äôm assuming they were behind Bayern, Dortmund, Leipzig at the very least\n\n50/1 Bayer Leverkusen to win. \n\n\n3/10 Bayern munich to win.\n\nAnd probably 5000/1 to do it unbeaten üôÇ what a story\n\nYeah, probably would've been max'd price. What a team.\n\nAccording to Opta, the winning chance was 0.9%.\n\nIn october in the 22/23 season, Leverkusen were 17th out of 18th before Xabi took over. They ended in 6th that season! That made them among the favourites although Bayern is always gonna be the big favourite to win any Bundesliga season. Hope and believe Leverkusen can do it again next season\n\nOne of the greatest turn arounds in history. Happy for them and my guy Xhaka too\n\nBayer were already favorites for the league, only behind bayern i think\n\nWhat? That's not true. The odds for Bayer Leverkusen to win the league before the season started was at a whopping 50/1. \n\nBayern were 3/10 heavy heavy favourites.\n\nI dont know about stats, sorry that was on me, i saw a lot of people putting bayer as the second favorite, but their conclusion only depends on their observations and not math (probably). So sorry for the misinformation but it still works if you try hard\n\nIn the sense of heart Vs head predictions, I can see it.\n\nCraziest revisionism i think I‚Äôve ever seen on Reddit. Bayer leverkusen were not favorites\n\nWhy do you just lie? I don't get what this kind of revisionism gets you....\n\nDamn that‚Äôs surprising\n\nWe often hear coaches say \"it's a process\". Then Xabi Alonso comes and shows how it's done. From not even being on the radar for winning the title at the beginning of the season, to winning it with 5 games in hand. Unbelievable.\n\nNot only that but winning a league that has been dominated by Bayern, past and present.\n\n[deleted]\n\nBayern did not get \"destroyed\" by Tuchel. They damaged themselves way before Tuchel with bad management choices.\n\nLast year was already close but were lucky to win. Now this season things got real serious and deservedly awarded.\n\nYeah they're really lucky being unbeaten for the entire season...\n\nBayern isn‚Äôt necessarily destroyed. The point total Bayern has is also good, Leverkusen is just that dominant this season.\n\n[deleted]\n\nI agree they haven‚Äôt been at the same level as their peak, that is clear. But they are still a dangerous team. They already drew at the Emirates and I would say that they have a good shot at beating Arsenal. Without having to worry about the league title, they have tremendous flexibility to be dangerous in the UCL.\n\nI don‚Äôt even want to think about how they will come back next season at this point, but they are overall a pretty well run club and will likely regain their throne.\n\nHow is getting a great coach luck? The club made the decision to hire Alonso.\n\nLucky that he did good\n\n‚ÄúLeverkusen was lucky to be a good team. If they were a bad team, they would lose‚Äù\n\nHow are their points compared to last season?\n\nThey were lucky they won it last season. It was about time\n\nWhat you say might make sense at first thought but just compare the stats to previous seasons; 71 pts, 77, 78, 82, 78, 84,‚Ä¶\n\nLeverkusen has 79 pts right now and still has 5 matches to play. So no, even if Bayern was good this season, Leverkusen still would have done it. It‚Äôs not luck, they really are this good. Check out for how long they‚Äôre unbeaten now.\n\nBayern is not to blame for this championship, and Bayern didn‚Äôt get destroyed by Tuchel, in fact it‚Äôs not that different to last season. (80% Nagelsmann season)\n\nYou could argue Leverkusen had luck by getting Xabi Alonso and him turning out to be this good (I doubt anyone expected a championship) but aren‚Äôt all clubs looking for that luck? Same when FCB sacked Nagelsmann for Tuchel\n\nNot even on the radar is stretching it a bit. They were considered to be the strongest contender for second place.\n\nThat I'm not sure about. I'm listening to some Bundesliga podcasts starting from Matchday 1, and Leipzig and Dortmund are mentioned as the top candidates to challenge Bayern.\n\nBut yeah, obviously the 16th spot we had when Xabi Alonso TRAINERGOTT took over was a bit of an outlier.\n\nNo they weren't\n\nLeverkusen did a superb job that will be remembered forever.\n\nThank you Harry Kane\n\nNeverkusen no more. Truly an amazing campaign.\n\nEpic. Now wait for Bayern and PL teams to dismantle the squad\n\nI think as long as Xabi is there, they can do it again.\n\nI hope so, maybe next season is even more epic but it's gonna happen eventually like it did with Dortmund\n\nWe can't\n\nAlonso us staying, Wirtz is staying. Only Frimpong has a low release clause. Grimaldo is staying. Xhaka is staying. Boniface too\n\nI think most players are believeing in xabi's project so i doubt most of them leaving, 2-3 max\n\nIt‚Äôs like you‚Äôre new to football rofl. First of all if you lose your best 2-3 players you‚Äôre already fucked and 2nd Germany cant compete with salaries so clauses mean nothing.\n\nI didn't say they would lose their *best* 2-3 players i think most transfers xabi will make will be for bayer's good, maybe frimpong cause of his release clause. But players like grimaldo and xhaka came because they believed xabi, dont think theyle leave soon\n\nPlus one argument is the project + CL football. Only if big clubs come with money around and the Player wants too.\n\nI am saying they will and they‚Äôll be screwed. You‚Äôre not replacing a Wirtz or a Frimpong that easily. I agree Xhaka and Grimaldo aren‚Äôt going anywhere but Leverkusen can‚Äôt compete with any of the big 20-25 clubs on a salary base. \n\nUnfortunately this happens to clubs like Leverkusen all the time.\n\nWirtz has confirmed publicly he's staying. Same with Grimaldo. Same with Xabi\n\nWe'll revisit this in a year's time, I guarantee you we'll be fighting it out for the meisterschale again next season\n\nYou don't know how Deutsche fussball works. It's not all about money here\n\nYeah because when City offers 100m for Wirtz, Leverkusen is going to say no to that money right? \n\nI agree. Let‚Äôs revisit in a year‚Äôs time.\n\nYeah Leverkusen will definitely say no to that because being company-owned means they are in no need to make huge profits with player-sales.\n\nAlso, you're delirious if you think Wirtz will go anywhere for less than 200 million euros.\n\nAlright. As said before. We‚Äôll see. Leverkusen fans are just high on euphoria right and more power to you but you‚Äôre going to lose your best players and go back to being mid next season. \n\nBest of luck. \n\nAlso lol 200m for Wirtz. Rofl.\n\nIn Euphoria right now?\n\nWe have been in Euphoria since Matchday 1 - and have been reading your take only about a million times. Remember the whole Xabi Alonso to Liverpool/Bayern saga?\n\nAnd outside of Frimpong, I don't recall anyone having release clauses. You know what that means? The club can decide, not the player.\n\n&gt; Also lol 200m for Wirtz. Rofl.\n\nMark my words üôÇ\n\nHarry kane curseüòÇ\n\nIf Xabi stays, then I think most players will stay and can win the league again\n\nHe has confirmed he is staying 2 weeks ago\n\n[He is staying](https://www.bundesliga.com/en/bundesliga/news/xabi-alonso-confirms-staying-at-bayer-leverkusen-liverpool-bayern-munich-coach-26784)\n\nI hope that username stays too\n\nSo Leverkusen are 5 games off matching the longest unbeaten run in all competitions in modern times (since the inauguration of continental tournaments) benfica in 1963-65 had a 48 game unbeaten run. Celtic (62 games) and Union Saint Gilloise (60 games) are the top 2 all time but this was when it was domestic trophies only.\n\nI wish Xabi would stay in Leverkusen for 10-15 years like Sir Alex Ferguson and become a legend. Then, I think his legacy would be eternal.\n\nFergy didn't stay in Aberdeen now\n\nSo would it if he leaves after next season and wins UCLs with bigger teams\n\nIf he does with Leverkusen, he'll be an eternal legend.\n\nOutside of their respective fans, who really cares whether or not Bayern, Real, Barca or one of the 100 mil per transfer window prem teams win the CL again. People talk about the Ajax and Monacco CL runs and the Leicester title run more than they do about the unbeaten Bayern run or City's treble just last year.\n\nA great underdog story is fun and uncontroversial! Even though Leicester magically won a PL u dont hear people suddenly claim Ranieri is one of the best coaches. Ppl do talk of the best teams like ManU under some of Sir Alex's reign, Barca/ManC under Guardiola, Real in the 50s or 2014-2018. \n\nSure would be cool if he stayed at a relatively small club but if they keep winning itll quickly not be considered a top club anymore.\n\nThe power of Harry Kane\n\nFirst time Kingsley Coman didn‚Äôt become champion\n\nIs this the so called Harry Kane effect?\n\nPoor Harry üíÄ\n\nUnreal. Been excellent to watch this season.\n\nStill can‚Äôt believe the bottle job last year that was Dortmund. \n\nCongratulations to Bayer Leverkusen!\n\nThanks Harry.\n\nComan in shambles\n\nAnyone heard from the Dortmund guys? I can't imagine how they feel having thrown away a title already won last year, and now someone else comes and shows them how it's done.\n\nHarry Kane‚Äôs curse continues.\n\nHarry Kane is cursed.\n\nDoes anyone remember the banner of the Vienna fans back then? \"Even we were German champions once\". \n\nNow Leverkusen have made it after all. And they absolutely deserved it.\n\nBut I'll never forget the Viennese.\n\nThe Kane effect\n\nTo be fair if Dortmund didn‚Äôt pull an incredible choke last year it should‚Äôve ended at 10. Bayern haven‚Äôt been even close to dominant for a while now. Kind of like Lewandowski leaving ruined them.\n\nsomeone tell me why they are already crowned champions? the season hasn't ended right?\n\nOnly 5 match days left, so max. 15 points to win. Leverkusen is 16 points ahead. Therefor they are champions even if they lose the next 5 matches.\n\nthanks man\n\nSide note : you can take the boy out of spurs, but u cannot take spurs out of the boy.\n\nMan joins teams that have won the league 10y straight and somehow the do not win it the first year he joinsü§£ü§£ü§£\n\nGreat for the fans, I mean their corporate sponsor‚Ä¶\n\nüí• üéâ\n\nOh wow that super competitive football league. I guess the other teams just play for fun.\n\nIt's amazing victories like this that make me realiae u can't take the premier league seriously any more.\n\nHow does that make any sense?\n\nLeicester win was even more crazy than this. Although, Xabi‚Äôs team does play better football."

    "all_comment_text": "It was literally a joke?\n\nStarting to see why people feel the need to put /s when they‚Äôre being sarcastic now.\n\n[removed]\n\nYeah, but you know what? r/FuckTheS\n\nThat's a them problem\n\nHow has a tongue in cheek joke to Liverpool fans on the Redmen TV charity live stream for Zoe's Place blown up this much? Mad haha.\n\nGerrard's late-night schedule to accommodate Liverpool matches is likely a big reason for the slump in form. No wonder supporters are angry if he cares more about watching his beloved Reds do well that his current side.\n\n...\n\nThats the sole source. Some alleged people online. Article so bad it could be published by Daily Star.\n\nEdit:\n\nThis is the \"\"\"journalist\"\"\". A Manchester guy who almost exclusively covers United\n\nhttps://muckrack.com/william-evans-20\n\nAnyone with half a brain knew he was joking. Agenda driven nonsense. Embarrassing by the 'journo'!\n\nLate training sessions make sense in KSA due to the climate as well. The culture is very nocturnal to my knowledge.\n\nYup, plus if you look at the time difference (+3 hours), for their training to clash with a Liverpool game they either need to be training at the weekend (they usually play matches instead) or at 11pm - 1am on a weeknight.\n\nIt's blown up because he is a shite manager and they are looking for any excuse to dump him.\n\nWhy would they need any excuse other than poor results\n\nThose damn Saudis famous for beating around the bush and being apprehensive in their decision making.¬†\n\nBecause if he resigns they stop paying him?\n\nI mean does the SA league really think people are coming there because they are serious about football/soccer? My dudes they are collecting \\*fat\\* paychecks and will bolt then they are bored.\n\nThe only reason the Premier League is as big as it is because it was the first to commercialize globally so it has the most money.\n\nPlayers have ALWAYS gone for the most money.\n\nThat‚Äôs why newly promoted teams like Forest can buy La Liga winners in their prime.\n\nThat‚Äôs why a Championship Wolves can buy Porto‚Äôs captain.\n\nI love our league but it is definitely driven by money.\n\nNah... lets give other leagues some credit.. PL is helped by the fact Seria A had the huge scandal and La Liga is corrupt as fuck. If RM, Barca and Juve have not fucked up their own leagues with their greed maybe they won't need a super league now.\n\nOh without a doubt. Particularly La Liga brought it on themselves.\n\nBasically, I do think anyone that could make the money the Prem are making absolutely would.\n\nSerie A had the most popular league and just didn‚Äôt commercialize it well enough in the 90‚Äôs/early 00‚Äôs.\n\nIn any case, I think people forget being a footballer is a job, just a very high paying one and most people jump ship for a pay rise.\n\nMind is blank, which la liga winner in their prime?\n\nRenan Lodi - not their best player of course but certainly was a regular international at that point\n\nLodi had fell out of favour for the National Team before he joined Forest and also Forest didn't even buy him lad he was a loan who signed for Marseille the next year. Hardly a sterling example of Premier League riches seducing La Liga winners away.\n\nHis whole point is silly when you consider only 3 teams have won La Liga in the past 20 years.\n\nOh yeah Real, Barca and Atleti can't compete financially with the mighty Forest\n\nWell no, that proves the point. \n\nThe fact is, ONLY those three teams in La Liga can compete with Forest because La Liga had individual licensing deals that meant all the money went to Madrid and Barcelona.\n\nThe Premier League commercialized as a collective and although the top teams were rewarded and capitalized the best, the disparity is miles away from La Liga where the rest of the clubs are paupers.\n\nThis isn‚Äôt really an opinion, it‚Äôs a factual disparity in income.\n\nThat's not what you said, you said Nottingham Forest can buy La Liga winners in their prime.\n\nThat is not true and they have not done that.\n\nNottingham Forest cannot compete financially with Real Madrid, Barcelona and Atletico Madrid.\n\nForest absolutely have more money than clubs of the same level in Spain but that isn't what you said.\n\nI also did not say Nottingham Forest can compete financially with Real Madrid, Barcelona and Atletico.\n\nTo be clear, I‚Äôm replying to you saying ‚Äúthe whole point is silly‚Äù because I thought it was pretty clear my whole point isn‚Äôt that Forest can compete with Real Madrid and Barcelona. \n\nIt‚Äôs that the Premier League is disproportionately richer than other leagues and players have come to the league as a result so this Saudi situation isn‚Äôt that new.\n\nWhile I agree, it‚Äôs not the best example, I feel you still illustrate the point. \n\nMarseille were a Champions League team that just finished second and third in a top 5 league.\n\nForest were newly promoted from the Championship.\n\nEven if you took out the Champions League clubs, the Prem spends so much more than other leagues, it‚Äôs crazy.\n\nG\n\ni think this mindset -idk if it really exist or not, don't really follow saudi league-  is just straight disrespectful and dishonest. they are getting paid, they need to do their jobs. saudi are being overly generous because they know that their league is inferior to other leagues. least the players and managers who went there could do is do their jobs properly.\n\nI agree it definitely reflects poorly on the character of the players and coaches who cash in. Same is/was said about the players who did that in MLS\n\nI mean he'll get a huge pay off. He's an awful manager though. What he did with that Villa squad is a disgrace.\n\nA Lampard-Gerrard relegation battle would be pure gold to watch though. More entertaining than the battle for the title.\n\nGive Scholes the United job and we can settle the debate once and for all.\n\nYeah, they aren't good enough for the Prem. Championship level the both of them. Gerrard definitely wouldn't do a better job at Plymouth than what Rooney is doing.\n\nIs he awful? He did a great job at Rangers. Does one bad job take that away?\n\nI think it's harsh and usually by those with an axe to grind, Im the same with Lampard although I think he has been mostly shite. Both of them need to rebuild themselves with another second tier team in the Championship if they want to have a serious career.\n\nA great job at Rangers is massively overstating it\n\nHe won 1 trophy from 9 despite spending 35+ million and while that was a great league season it was mostly in front of no fans under no real pressure \n\nEven in that season St Johnstone won more trophies than Rangers despite it being as free a shot at a treble for them as you‚Äôll ever get\n\nHe won the league unbeaten with a team that hadn't won the league for 9 years. So yes it was a great job. St Johnstone didn't win the league unbeaten. Stop embarrassing yourself\n\nSure they did well in the league that season - mostly under no real challenge, St Johnstone won 2 trophies that season though and his teams generally always fell apart under pressure\n\nHe had an awful record in cup competitions, lost a treble to Neil Lennon and was on the brink of being sacked before COVID stopped football\n\nHe‚Äôs a terrible manager\n\nYeah, while it's impressive to go unbeaten in one season it was during COVID with no fans which definitely skews results. Yes you get less of an advantage at home but it is easier away from home. Man United under Ole went on a really long unbeaten away from home streak under COVID for example which felt Artificial during Covid. Secondly Celtic were going through a rebuild so it was ideal timing.  He should have won more trophies at Rangers and done better in Europe. I get you are a Liverpool fan and protecting your man but Villa was a truer test of his ability and he failed abysmally. Gerrard also failing at Al-Ettifaq. Would have been sacked a month ago if he wasn't a legendary player with brand value to the league.\nGerrard is going to have to recreate himself as a manager in the Championship, back at Rangers who are in a bit of a state at the moment or go to maybe the Dutch League.  He will do a mixed job at best at his next club.\n\nWe weren‚Äôt really going through a rebuild, if anything we held onto players a season too long\n\nThe rebuild was the summer after when Ange came in\n\nI think it's silly to say he's a terrible manager because of one bad job. He might well be and the fact he gave up and went to Saudi shows he probably doesn't have the mentality for it. I don't have hope for him but you can't judge him on one job and not the other.\n\nDespite how you try to dress it up he did a great job at Rangers and did something nobody else was able to do. No two ways about it. You quite literally can't write him off because of one bad job. Emery himself who is doing so well with Villa did a bad job at Arsenal. Plenty of good managers have had a bad job in their career. Ancelotti, Capello, Emery, Clough, Benitez, and so on\n\n2 terrible jobs\n\nIt wasn‚Äôt a *great* job at Rangers. It was one great *league* season\n\n1 terrible job. \n\nIn what world is he doing a terrible job at Al Ettifaq? Also being the only manager to win the title with Rangers in over a decade and doing so unbeaten quite literally makes it a great job. What do you want him to do? Win it twice when nobody else has managed to do it once\n\nProbably the world where their fans want him sacked tbh\n\nIn the season he won the league they had the easiest treble you‚Äôre ever going to get and lost in the cups twice \n\nIt was a great singular league season under unprecedented circumstances where his only rival for the league had a spectacular meltdown lead by another mostly terrible manager who Gerrard had just lost a treble to\n\nIf it wasn‚Äôt for COVID happening when it did, Rangers were going to lose to Celtic that weekend and Gerrard would have been close to the sack, they were in horrendous form. COVID saved his job\n\nHis cup record in general is awful, they‚Äôve won more since he left than they did when he was there\n\nThat's great but he did a great job at Rangers and he certainly hasn't done a bad job at Al Ettifaq so I'm not sure your point\n\nHe's underperforming at Al-Ettifaq as well as his record with Villa. He's got players like Moussa Dembele, Wijnaldum, Demarai Gray and Jack Hendry and the team hasn't won in 2 months. That's 2/3.\n\nThe Rangers squad he had was very talented and the players were peaking at the right time. It also coincided with the Celtic team going through a rebuild. The best championship managers would have also thrived in that set up. I'd be careful pinning too much credit on Gerrard.\n\nThe players peaking were largely the players he brought in though. He rebuilt us from the absolute pits. I don‚Äôt think he is a remarkable manager and I don‚Äôt think I would take him back, but what he oversaw at Rangers really was a huge achievement.\n\nSo he‚Äôs got three dogshit players and a semi retired Gini, wow how‚Äôs he not won the league with that team of superstars üòÆüòµüòµüòµ\n\nI'm sorry, but he needs to win a game, not the league. In terms of quality, his squad is mid table level, and they are being outplayed by relegation sides.\n\nAll 4 of those players could play for a Premier league side, it's disrespectful to call them dogshite\n\nLet's face it, you'd be hard pushed to fuck it up at Rangers especially the time she was there. My dog could've done that job just as well.\n\nWell your dog couldn't seeing as Gerrard is the only manager to do it in over a decade. And he did it unbeaten\n\nSo how's that experience working out for him now? Gerrard not my dog.\n\nDid you get confused? My comment you originally replied to was me saying he did a great job at Rangers, so does one bad job at Villa take that away?\n\nDid you get confused? He did nothing at Rangers that any other Manager couldn't have done at that period. Stick him in a competitive league with more than a handful of dominant teams and he chokes, so yes one bad job at Villa does *take it away.*\n\nNot every ex-player makes a good manager, I'm not saying this because I don't like the man, most ex-Utd players couldn't manage regardless of how good they could play.\n\nBTW I was joking, I don't have a dog.\n\nExcept he literally did something that no other manager could do. He was the only manager in over a decade to win the league with Rangers and he did it unbeaten. I think it's a bit silly to say one bad job at Villa takes away what he did at Rangers. Plenty of good managers have had one job that went bad\n\nHe has done a bad job at Villa AND Al-Ettifaq. He's going to get sacked if he loses the next couple of games, and if he wasn't a legendary player with brand value for the league he'd have gone a month ago.\n\nHe hasn't done a bad job at Al Ettifaq? They finished 6th last season and this season after only 8 games are 10th but 2 points of 5th. \n\nThe two seasons before Gerrard joined they finished 7th and 11th, he has quite literally improved them. And this is during a time where he's rivals have signed some top class players. He's had some signings too but nothing compared to the big sides, his biggest signings are Henderson and Wijnaldum who both could barely run anymore\n\nOkay I get it you're a Gerrard fanboy, it doesn't matter to you when people tell you he's not a good manager. Let's see where he's at the end of their season.\n\nI don't think there's anything to say he's a good manager. But I'm just saying facts. Am I not?\n\n\"he's an awful manager\" no he is not, he proved himself at Rangers that he can be a great mamager in the right team, it's a shame that Liverpoop never gave him a chance , Lampard got a chance, Xavi got a chance but a legend like Gerrard didn't smh\n\nEmery 2 years later having Villa top of the Champions League from the bottom of the Prem, just sums up how horrendous this tit is.\n\nDoes it? I mean Stevie G is objectively bad but Emery is a genius. 99% of other coaches wouldn‚Äôt have Villa this far.\n\nWhat him and Emery did with Sevilla was insane. It was like Villa with 10x less money\n\nHe won the SPL with Rangers. He clearly has talent. He just made the jump faaaaaar too quick. Same with Lampard, done decent with Derby then boom Chelsea job.\n\nHe could‚Äôve tried to bounce back he did good at villa his first few months and he did great at rangers, he chose to throw any chance of a career away for the blood money\n\nLoads of pool supporters were heralding him as Klopp's successor a few year ago\n\nA few years ago he went invincible with Rangers so it‚Äôs hardly a surprise people were excited about his future as a manager.\n\nCeltic absolutely imploded that season, not saying it wasn‚Äôt a great achievement, but Celtic helped.\nPlus it was the Covid season where there were no fans.\n\nOn a given year anyone could win the league with an old firm team. Especially if the other one has an off year, the SPL is the ultimate farmers league\n\nThat's just not true. Nobody has been able to win the league with Rangers forever other than Gerrard\n\nSince they've come back from administration that's true but as a general rule in Scottish football, the old firm is the only way to win the league unless you're Fergie in the early 80s\n\n\"in this era he did a great feat but from the 90s to 2012 it was not a big deal. therefore he sucks\"\n\nYet City have won 7 out the last 8 lol.\n\nSays more about the quality of the Scottish prem than Gerrard\n\nIrregardless it was still an impressive start even if the Scottish League is championship quality going invincible isn‚Äôt anything to scoff at.\n\nIt‚Äôs not championship quality. There‚Äôs players from the conference that go to play in the SPL. Without rangers and Celtic it‚Äôs more like a league 2 level\n\nI have to be completely honest here, all my Kopite mates were saying let's give him more time before that would even be a possibility, I can't remember anyone of them saying to me at the time get him after Kloppy announced he was leaving, I have to be honest.\n\nYeah the consensus was if he continued to progress, Villa was a logical step but he didnt progress and now is on a working holiday. He needs to start again and get a sleeping giant like a Boro, Swansea, QPR, Derby(Sunderland I'd say but they seem okay) etc back into the prem, survive then move to another upper mid table side like Villa.\n\nBecause after Kloppy was leaving wasn't the time that Gerrard was being called for as Klopps successor, it was before his failed Villa stint. And yes, it was a thing.\n\nIt was definitely a thing in 2021 after Rangers won the league, and the sub would down vote you into Hades if you suggested that we needed to see more from Gerrard before he becomes a serious successor candidate\n\nNo they weren‚Äôt. Plenty *hoped* he‚Äôd reach that level some day, but that‚Äôs it.\n\nhttps://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/37623311/jurgen-klopp-steven-gerrard-definitely-become-liverpool-manager-one-day\n\nKlopp literally said:\n\n&gt;I think that Stevie is doing really well and he's very young from a manager's point of view so it's just when is the right moment for him to take the job. Yes, I believe it will definitely happen and good for everyone.\n\nThat‚Äôs literally exactly what I said.\n\nHe even mentions that he‚Äôs very young. It isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúhe could take the job right now‚Äù it‚Äôs a ‚Äúone day when he‚Äôs reached where he needs to‚Äù.\n\nSaying \"it will definitely happen some day\" and \"I hope it'll happen some day\" is not literally exactly the same at all\n\nUse your brain.\n\nDon't be silly, ChatGPT does all my thinking for me these days. I'm been thinking thoughts all my life and where has that got me?\n\nI wouldn‚Äôt say loads. No one with any sense.\n\nJ√ºrgen Klopp said he absolutely believed Gerrard would manage Liverpool some day. \n\nIt's not some crazy made up thing, many people were saying it back then\n\nKlopp bigging up an opposition manager just before they come to Anfield? Yeah he must have been 100% genuine. He also claimed Lovren was ‚Äúoutstanding‚Äù after one of his many horror shows. Not everything he said should be taken at face value.\n\nSince this isn‚Äôt /r/soccer, for an objective discussion of his strengths and weaknesses of his management skills, what would you say those are?\n\nWould have been fine if he scheduled it around 115 FC instead\n\nSportswashing agent\n\nHahahahaha this is best kinda shithousing\n\nBoomers still cant figure out the DVR? Sheikh in my head‚Ä¶\n\nLegend\n\nReally forgot he was managing still\n\nProper priorities that.\n\nInject every part of this story directly into my veins. Holy crap this is magical.\n\nWait, he is still there? For some reason I thought he left in disgrace prematurely like Henderson.\n\nThat's a tough spot for Gerrard to be in. Balancing his passion for Liverpool with his new responsibilities must be challenging. I hope things smooth out soon!\n\nThat‚Äôs hilarious! His loyalties remain evenly split between his new managerial venture &amp; the team he made a name for himself in - Liverpool FC. Hopefully the schedule works for the Al Ettifaq players! ‚úåÔ∏è\n\nThe love for LFC never dies\n\nLol\n\nThat‚Äôs awesome man he‚Äôll yea\n\nPlease resign from this big ass contract we signed you to\n\nThey should be asking him to resign for being a shit manager not a pretty tame joke he made.\n\nIt was a joke, but they should be getting rid of him because he's a horrendous manager.\n\nEpic if true. And understandable.\n\nI don't support Liverpool..ha ha ha\n\nI mean it‚Äôs not a serious league what‚Äôs everyone expecting\n\nWhat's not serious about it? People were laughing at the Premier League in the 90s.\n\nI made a post just like this and got downvoted to hell complaining that he was travelling to Liverpool midweek to watch their games while he was coaching Villa. It just shows where his commitment is. He really should just go work his way up the Liverpool academy and maybe he could be a decent manager one day. Until then this guy has shown zero credentials to lead a team and is a mockery to all coaches (like myself) that work so hard everyday on that side of the game. Maybe Al-Ettifaq can relish in the fact that I posted that only a couple weeks before we sacked slippy G, history might just repeat itself here.\n\nHe was coaching at the Liverpool academy before he got the Rangers job.\n\nZero credentials? \n\nHow about managing Rangers to an invincible season?! Does that count? And if it doesn't count then let me know what your credentials are seen as your a coach\n\nu/Jimmeejanga isnt being offered millions a year to turn Aston Villa into a bag of wank is he?\n\nThat's irrelevant. They are saying that Gerrard has 0 managerial credentials. My point is how on earth can a coach with (I assume) literally 0 credentials bash a manager who has won the scottish Prem unbeaten lool\n\nThink you've got me mixed up there. I merely corrected the poster saying Gerrard should go to the Liverpool academy to coach.\n\nYeah this whole thread has got a bit confusing but am glad we can all agree Gerrard is a good manager at least üëç\n\nI dunno how he is tbh, obviously did well at Rangers and he should have stayed there a bit longer. A lot of credit was going to Michael Beale but he has shat the bed a lot since so it's hard to know.\n\nAll I know is, I don't want him anywhere near the managers position at Liverpool.\n\nThis is the reality, Michael Beale was the technical and tactical side of that Rangers team, Gerrard was basically a match day hype man. Listen to any of the players during his time at Villa, it was the exact same. He‚Äôs rode on the coattails of his coaching staff and then he threw them under the bus and tried to do his own thing and has shown absolutely nothing since. But shockingly it‚Äôs less than nothing, because he seems to make teams worse. Imagine training at 8pm because the gaffer wants to watch someone else play footy in the afternoon. And you can take shots at my credentials, but as someone who works in that profession and actually works hard at developing football players (even having a couple former players play professionally &amp; internationally), someone who treats their coaching staff the way he has, merits zero respect from me. Maybe he‚Äôs a great hype man, he was a phenomenal player, but right now he‚Äôs shown zero credibility as a manager.\n\n&gt; a mockery to all coaches (like myself)\n\nThis can't be real üòÇüòÇüòÇ\n\nHahahah slippin gerry"

    "all_comment_text": "Wait,are they seriously gonna relegate another french giant?\n\nYep, couldn‚Äôt secure a TV deal at the start of the season so the whole leagues finances have been gutted.\n\nIs this the start of the football bubble bursting?\n\nOnly in Ligue 1 imo. The clubs got SHAFTED with the Media Pro deal the league signed a few years ago and it‚Äôs hard to recover.\n\nOther leagues rejected Media Pro but the French organizers were not as through with their checks.\n\nWhen that happened only PSG weren‚Äôt immediately put on sale in Ligue 1. It‚Äôs clear to see that this and Covid has been hard for Lyon\n\nAre far as I know this seems like an exclusive problem in France. Who would have thought one sole team having the majority of the financial resources could bite them in the ass later.\n\nYeah the premier league were very smart giving equal shares to it's teams\n\nPSG finances hardly care about french league TV money though...\n\nYeah, not like La Liga who has *two*, maybe.\n\nNo, the main difference between France and the rest of Europe is that we have an agency that is here to control club finances, if it existed (the French way) in any of the other top 5 leagues 80% of the clubs would be relegated.\n\nNo fucking way would German clubs suffer this way. German clubs also have licensing to go through each and every season.\n\nSchalke 04 also suffered financial issue right..\n\nDecades of mismanagement on and off the field will do that, yeah. Last I checked they‚Äôre not in the Bundesliga nor are they 80% of the Bundesliga teams.\n\nI‚Äôll give you Germans you‚Äôre right but Spain Italy and England would be dead\n\nSpain and Italy yeah, England in the prem is tough because while they may have debts they do service it with incredible cash flows.\n\nItaly would probably be the harshest, among the top teams only Milan and Atalanta seemingly make an effort to balance their spending.\n\nI think Napoli and Lazio also would survive that, and some smaller clubs that don't spend all that much\n\nNapoli and Lazio perhaps because their owners aren‚Äôt spending big and extort big clubs for money. The smaller clubs are fucked, Italian match day revenue is terrible.\n\nWhat does this mean?\n\nLigue 1 couldn‚Äôt arrange a broadcasting deal before the season started and so all the teams finances are at a much greater risk of collapsing\n\nIt's ok they will add another team from a foreign country just like AS Monaco\n\nYup\n\nMacron with PSG : Oh,you poor oil baby.\n\nMacron with everyone else: You donkey brain!\n\nRelegation at the end of the season or now?\n\nRelegation at the end of the season if they can't make up the money.\n\nAs per L'Equipe, Lyon are convinced that player sales as well as player sales from sister club Botafogo, as well as the sale of 45% of the shares from Crystal Palace will clear their debts.\n\nI know they are sisters clubs but selling assets of one club to move the money to another is that allowed ? Sounds kinda fucked still\n\nI agree; it's all a bit weird...\n\n‚ÄúHey guys let‚Äôs just liquidate Botafogo and pay off the debt‚Äù\n\nLmao Botaofgo is the best team from Textor group lol \n\n\nThey're fighting to win both the national league and the Libertadores\n\nAll the more to liquidate!!\n\nBest ask Man City that one\n\nI feel the 45% shares of Crystal palace are worth way more than Lyon\n\nCrystal what?\n\nI would prefer a relegation than this miss up\n\nAt the end if they can't pay it off in time. Half a billion dollars lol\n\nI fail to see how this is healthy for football in France. Lots of cool kids hanging out in lower leagues mostly because they got caught out like the tide at the beach on a TV deal\n\nGerard Lopez joins Lille: 400 millions debt. Then joins Bordeaux: club is dead (like all his clubs btw). A couple years later, Lille is now debt free and thriving. Foreign investors like Lopez or Textor are the real problem (not that TV deals aren't a problem, but it's not just that)\n\nFM25 rebuild project incoming\n\nThat game is never coming out\n\nThankfully there is FM24/25 mod out there and for how it easy to mod FM on PC I don‚Äôt think we need FM25 rn. And let‚Äôs  be honest here, nothing substantial changes from one instalment to another outside for players\n\nCan you provide a link or something on how to update? I‚Äôve been getting that FM itch again this time of year since it‚Äôs usually out around this time üòÖ\n\nMe to bud. Nothing hits like that 5 save &amp; reload during those long November evenings\n\n\nThere you go.\n\nhttps://www.fmscout.com/a-fm24-to-fm25-dlc.html\n\nAnd if you want actual faces or any other piece of FM mods go to here:\n\nhttps://sortitoutsi.net\n\nThanks üëç\n\nYou absolute legend\n\nThere is a big revamp coming for this year afaik. Whenever it will come is another question‚Ä¶.\n\nI think at one point where they cannot provide a meaningful upgrade to previous version, they will start selling data pack for new changes\n\nProbably but still in game editor will be sold for 10$ or whatever form me is like 35 PLN which is roughly 8,5$\n\nI think it's better that way. I've always dreamt of a sports game that doesn't have any year in its name, and solely work with databases from various seasons/competitive years. It lifts some pressure on the devs to make \"big changes\" to keep up with sports evolution IRL.\n\nThey haven't provided a meaningful update in years\n\nbro yes we do the stats are badly outdated.\n\nThis takes me back to Bordeaux \n\nSad to see them in this state\n\nSame culprit : american owners\n\nThe one from bordeaux is from luxemburgo and spanish origin.\n\nYes but it's not really his fault, previous owners tanked the club (GACP group or something).\nBut Lopez tanked it even further\n\nThat‚Äôs so sad, damn\n\nWow this is truly crazy. First bordaux now lyon.\n\nThere probably won't be any relegation, they'll find the money I think.\n\nHowever they cannot recruit, will have to sell the few best players like Fofana and will have to do everything to obtain a qualification in CL which would bring in a lot of money. It looks very very hard.\n\nDamn!! This is sad.\n\nWhat's the background for this? Hard time understanding what's going on\n\nYou should watch this video with subtitles if available:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgohcV8OwkU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgohcV8OwkU)\n\nThat's so sad. Football is getting ruined...\n\nFuck Textor, bring Zaha home!\n\nLigue un makes serie a look like the premier league\n\nSerie A over prem anyday u twat\n\nI mean you can like it more,but thats not even the point im trying to make. Serie a has money problems whether you like it or not its just a fact\n\nMb üôè\n\nGee I wonder why the French league is fucked\n\nCity next please.\n\nThey were spending silly money during the summer. Must have been About ¬£50m to Forest for a couple of our players.\n\nGood for my next FM save.\n\nUnbelievable that one of the greatest clubs of one of the biggest footballing nations is going through this.\n\n[removed]\n\nTextors Brazilian team are currently top of the Campeonato and in the Libertadores final. Palace ain't doing too roughly either. Can't throw all the blame on Textor here.\n\nCrystal palace is in the relegation zone.\n\nPosition in the league won't stop a team from struggling financially if they are spending above their means. For all we know those teams you mentioned could be over spending.\n\n[removed]\n\nRWDM got relegated last season but hey they broke the transfer fee record in Belgium by buying a player for 26M and putting him on loan in Lyon.\n\nIt‚Äôs funny, I got a Brazilian commenting in the Palace sub mad that we were ‚Äúungrateful‚Äù for him. I‚Äôm wondering if he‚Äôll feel the same when he fucks them over like he has us and Lyon?\n\nMeaning team in 16th position will be stayed, if this scenario happen.\n\nHoly shit\n\nOlympique Lyonnais to Ligue 2 confirmed, HERE WE GO!\n\nWhat is going wrong with French Football?

Leagues cup is a joke.\n\nüé∂ SE-A-TTLE  üé∂\n\nüé∂SOUU-NDERSüé∂\n\nFIGHT‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. AND WIN\n\nI BELIEVE\n\ndon‚Äôt threaten me with a good time\n\nSounds exciting. I mean I don't even watch the PL now. The money in football has ruined it for me.\n\nI just stick to my own team and the odd CL game.\n\nI think that's how the majority watch, it's an absolute minority who watch every game of every team in a league\n\nWell seeing as my team is not in the top 5 leagues and I go to all the games I somehow doubt that.\n\nPlus it seems every week there's someone in here claiming to support a team from everyone of the top 5 leagues.\n\nYou doubt that it's only a minority who watch every game of every team in a league... because you watch all your own teams games and they're not in a top 5 league??\n\nYou're gonna have to break that down mate because I'm not picking up what you're trying to put down here\n\n&gt; I just stick to my own team and the odd CL game\n\nYou say that like it‚Äôs a bad thing. Isn‚Äôt that completely normal for everyone who isn‚Äôt plastic? I thought everyone was doing that anyway.\n\nAgreed.\n\n[deleted]\n\nSo, what exactly is the issue? I genuinely do not understand why you‚Äôre saying this like something has gone wrong with the world when this is just, what people were always doing.\n\nWhy are you even watching PL games if you support Torquay anyway? Surely just have them on the radio and that‚Äôs it.\n\n&gt;¬†¬†Why are you even watching PL games if you support Torquay anyway?\n\n\nI support one of the lower Greater Manchester teams but I still follow the Prem so I can shit on United fans ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\n\nI mean, I support United on very loosely terms (since I only consider myself as a real fan of my home city's club), and I also watch the Prem to shit on United. It got to a point it is a fun, weekly endeavour.\n\nYeah I thought that was the point. I‚Äôm not watching games Arsenal or England aren‚Äôt in. I might watch a final or something or if I‚Äôm not doing anything else.¬†\n\nI think you are underestimating the amount of plastic fans out there.\n\nUnfortunately I cannot comment on this issue due to previously being banned for how I described people who don't go to games.\n\nThe old format was fine. It's just this one is unnecessary.\n\nIt's obviously FIFA's attempt to grab what last bit of real estate is on the football calendar, but I think out of all of them it's one of the more beneficial ones to the game.  I'd rather have an expanded CWC than additional CL or Nations League matches and their equivalents in other regions.  Much like expanding the World Cup has increased the popularity and quality of football in nations outside of Europe and South America, expanding the CWC and giving more top clubs outside of Europe the chance to play against the top European clubs in real competitive matches (and getting the money that would come along with it) would have similar impacts on the club side of the game over time.\n\nIt's not instead of though, it's as well as.\n\nI‚Äôve thought for a while that a 16 team CWC would be good, with a group stage and then knockout so 6 games total for the winners. Of course the difficulty is fitting it in the calendar somewhere, can‚Äôt really have it spread out during the season because of the travel involved.\n\nNo it's not enough teams. It's hard to win the Asian champions league, or the African champions league or the Copa Libertadores. All four winners from all of those competitions deserve to be there.\n\nThe point is to open up world football to some of the mega clubs from around the world. I'm sure the final four teams will most likely be European ones but there will be some unexpected results and decent runs from unexpected teams.\n\nThe competition has merit and purpose, the scheduling of extra games is something to be considered but for the sake of saving one game you're not going to strip 16 clubs of the chance to play. The whole point of the comp is not to gatekeep football as has been near enough forever.\n\nRealistically we need to get rid of the nations league, get rid of the conference cup, get rid of the league cup and get rid of the club world cup. Doing this would improve players performances massively. \n\nWorld Cup\nEuros\nChampions league\nEuropa League\nPremier league equivalent to each league\nFa cup equivalent to each league. \n\nThis should be all their is. Everything else is just a waste of everyone's time. It's not that complicated but somehow these governing bodies just don't fucking get it. Nobody cares about all the other stupid competitions just bin them off free up the football calender and the revenue will improve because the quality of football will improve because players are playing 70 games a season and exhausted out of their minds.\n\nWhile I agree with your sentiment I have to point out that revenue would decrease if they play less games. More games means more revenue and that‚Äôs why they shove all these extra games on the schedule.\n\nAnecdotally I can say I've stopped watching football entirely because there's so much of it. Maybe it's also due to me getting older, but I don't find the excitement of it with so many unnecessary competitions. I feel like if there were fewer games people like me would enjoy again league and international games.\n\nTo an extent yes. However I think there would be more people watching the bigger games if the calendars weren't so diluted with shit ones. Games tend to lose their intensity when players are super tired and managing the game because they have another one in 3 days time. This means less viewership because games are then less entertaining. I don't think the revenue drop would be as large as you think. On top of this who really watches these shitty games anyway? Do people really tune in to watch Man City vs Sao Paolo in the club work cup? I have never ever watched one of those games and never will. They are just glorified friendlies.\n\nSeriously, it was a silly tournament that doesn't make any sense from day one.¬†\n\nIt made sort of sense until they announced they were going to keep the existing CWC and just change the name, so a team winning the Champions League would have to play in the current CWC and the new CWC. \n\nHaving it in the summer rather than halfway through the (european) season is an improvement\n\nNot making sense is a running theme in football now,\nNations league and the new champions league and Europa league formats. \n\nBut not making sense = money\n\nI have no idea what FIFA is thinking when they schedule it at the exact same time as the Gold Cup. They ensure that the Mexican teams can't even field their best players.\n\nAgreed.  \n\n\nUEFA already sucked the joy out of the earlier stages of UCL with the new format.  It's all about more games and more money for both UEFA and FIFA.\n\nThey should just expand the Champions League to be a global competition. That would be fucking amazing.¬†\n\nBut how will we decide the world champions of club football?? /s\n\npretty sure the idiots already sold tv rights and advertising. they will have to payback lots of money and bribes.\n\nPointless as it is atm yes but this new format is once every 4 yrs and looks great to me.\n\nAbsolutely pointless\n\ni think even the worlds game, the beautiful game has reached an absolute saturation point. To make it worse it is also negatively affecting players.\n\nBetween FIFA, the leagues, and the confederations this is just another aspect of late stage greed capitalism. Trying to suck every dollar and all the joy out of something fun.\n\nAre you referring to players being made to play too many games?\n\nA former English football club owner (Simon Jordan, Crystal Palace FC) recently commented on this, and his point was that most players in the Premier League will be involved in around 40-50 games a season at the very most (many more will be involved in between 38, league games, and 42, cup games). Very few will be involved close to 50 and even fewer will play in more, so the majority can hardly complain about their workload.\n\nI sympathise with those who are pushed to their physical limits (look at Bakayo Saka at Arsenal, who is young and relies on speed, and who is played when fit), and don‚Äôt doubt it takes its toll on them physically and mentally, but they are the absolute minority in English football. I expect other leagues to largely mirror this.\n\nAnd the travel and the nature of many clubs turning into year round playing/touring.\nI also don‚Äôt doubt that the most vocal critics are the minority that play for club and country.\n\nYeah, lots travel takes its toll, and an increasingly international pre-season schedule will be gruelling. But these are still likely to be a minority. The universal truth does seem to be players welfare is not a priority.\n\nEdit: admittedly, some are paid a shit-load, I expect I‚Äôd accept comparably worse for comparably less money.\n\nYou're right.  For many players, the workload is not too high.  But for the elite 10%, which is who we want to see play, they go from league play, to in season tournaments like copa d' Italia or fa cup, to additional in season tournaments like carabao cup, to European play, to international play.  When you have Rodri, Thierry Henri and more saying that the best of the best are not performing at *their* best because they are playing close to 70 games (club and country) then *you* should listen.  Those are people that know more than you do.\n\nYeah, you want to see the best at their absolute best when they play. If they‚Äôre rocking up tired and recovering from injury there‚Äôs less to enjoy.\n\nIt's fine as it is.\n\nClub world cup never reached the same status as the intercontinental cup anyway, because that cup was already dramatically unbalanced since the 2000's.\n\nIt's fine doing a Champions league winner vs others as it is now, even if europe will win 90% of the time.\n\nBut adding a whole new tournament into an already polluted schedule is plain insane. Whatever money club will get they will spend all in travels, wages for squad depth, injuries and subsequently getting out of other competitions because of fatigue.\n\nIt's just idiotic and only a way to make some fifa representatives from obscure countries more rich.\n\n&gt; Club world cup never reached the same status as the intercontinental cup\n\nwhich FIFA are resurrecting as well as the Club World Cup\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_FIFA_Intercontinental_Cup\n\nStarts on Sunday\n\nSo they want the Intercontinental which is basically the Club World Cup, and then another full tournament\n\nThey will have an Intercontinental Champion, and a World Champion.. presumably when Madrid win both they will be the Undisputed Champion\n\nits like WWE\n\nHahahaha didn't about that \n\nNext it's Fifa vs Raw\n\n&gt;It's fine as it is.\n\nI agree.\n\nI've heard people saying it should just be a Champions League Vs Copa Libertadores super cup. But I fully believe in having a framework where pretty much any team on the planet COULD be crowned the best in the world. Which I believe we have.\n\nNone of that arrogant (yet probably factual) US Sports stuff where the NBA/NFL winner goes around saying they're the world champions. If some team in Japan or South Africa becomes truly world class then they deserve a shot.\n\nIf it's not generating much interest or revenue then that's on FIFA's marketing and commercial teams.\n\n&gt; It's fine doing a Champions league winner vs others as it is now, even if europe will win 90% of the time.\n\nNope, still utter bollocks. \n\nIt's the world's most pointless friendly and it takes place in the middle of the season.\n\nYou are being completely one sided here with a eurocentric perspective.\n\nSouth American clubs take the tournament extremely seriously. Even if we lose (which is true for the past decade or so) we are really proud to face the European champions and when we win we celebrate. Winning this tournament means a lot to us, because it's a David x Goliath event.\n\nIf Europeans don't care it's not a problem, but don't say this is not important just because it's not for you.\n\nNot only SA clubs but players as well\n\nYes, and we fans go crazy when it happens.\n\nIt's a source of pride and goes down in the club's history.\n\nIt's funnier even that the English, usually being the most arrogant, forget that they lost 2 out of the last 5 and, in 2 of the wins, were taken to extra time.\n\nAnd that other than Man Utd. they were the irrelevant ones until the 00's when billionaires started buying their clubs.\n\nYea, I went with 5 because it's rounder, but the sixth game is Romario and Edmundo destroying Manchester Reds\n\nMake up your mind. You can‚Äôt criticise them for not taking it seriously but then crow about the fact that they lose the games they didn‚Äôt take seriously. The reality is that nobody in Europe cares about that trophy in the slightest and while I sympathise with people who do take it seriously you can‚Äôt force interest into it. We need to work within reality rather than try to bend reality to fit our preferred world view.\n\n&gt; The reality is that nobody in Europe cares about that trophy in the slightest and while I sympathise with people who do take it seriously you can‚Äôt force interest into it\n\nThe players certainly care, from all we have seen in matches. Most of the \"I don't care discourse\" seems to be from overly online internet denizens.\n\nAs a season ticket holder I can safely say that if I were to ask everyone sat around me what priority they would give to certain trophies, the world club championship or whatever the latest guise would be, would be at the bottom half of available competitions. I doubt they‚Äôd even be able to name half of the last ten winners and yet they‚Äôd reel off every FA Cup finalists for the past thirty years. Just accept that many people don‚Äôt hold the same opinion as you and work within reality rather than trying to fight reality itself.\n\nBrother, a bunch of English nobody, isolationist Brexit arrogant fucks who have no say in how teams are run don't speak for the entirety of Europe, as much as that may blow your mind.\n\nI‚Äôm just going to leave your comment to speak for itself\n\nYou could have done that but literally didn't\n\nExactly. I'm all for leaving it as it is, because it's still good fun and anyway the intercontinental title is a legacy of football.\n\nBut doing a whole pointless tournament is just too much.\n\nI totally agree with your points.\n\nThis is just someone being completely ignorant about the rest of the world.\n\nAnd FIFA being a greedy organisation as usual.\n\n&gt; \nIf Europeans don't care it's not my problem, but don't say this is not important just because it's not for you.\n\nIt's not important because it is a glorified friendly.\n\nJust because it's your only shot at playing a decent side doesn't mean that it's suddenly important.\n\nA 3rd round FA Cup tie between a 7th tier club and Manchester United means the fucking world to that club, but it doesn't make it an important tie.\n\nWhat are you, 12?\n\nNo, I just have utterly zero interest in a competition which is irrelevant and just used to make money for fifa.\n\n\nIt's not a real competition.¬†\n\nEurocentric idiot.\n\nGot it.\n\nFIFA can't even get a broadcaster willing to pay for their pointless tournament. It's not Eurocentrism, it's just fact.\n\nYour local team should have to play my college team. These boys deserve to have a David vs Goliath game like yours.\n\nWow, what a great comparison.\n\nYou should be proud of your great display of intelligence.\n\nAnd the confidence to actually post it as well!\n\nCongrats.\n\nWhat a great, and substance-less response. You should be proud of your great display of intelligence. And confidence to actually post it, as well!\n\nCongrats!\n\n\nThe point being made is, why should other clubs be forced into a competition that they don‚Äôt want to play in just because it would be meaningful to the smaller clubs?\n\nClubs can always send backups/U20 if they are so confident that South American team will not win.\n\nI hope big teams just send their youth prospects, make it like Olympics u23 with maybe a couple other guys.\n\nThey already have the u20s world cup. It's pretty redundant. FIFA should stay out of club level football tournaments. Stick to international tournaments\n\nIt is kind of romantic to see the copa champions vs the CL winners but it‚Äôs really an exhibition game and should be treated like one. It‚Äôs like in a movie when everything takes place within a dream or a video game - there‚Äôs nothing really tangible at stake but it can still be enjoyable.\n\nWhen was even the last time a non European club has won it? It's been a bit dull and boring lately even if it wasn't all that serious.\n\nA good while but the early 2000s and before it was quite good, before that when it was just the intertoto it was fun. \n\nI‚Äôd rather they just had it a home and away two legged game with the Copa and champions league winners to have some proper atmosphere at the games. It doesn‚Äôt happen now in the countries that pay for it.\n\n*edit - intercontinental cup not intertoto. Some nostalgia with that word\n\nThat‚Äôs a great idea\n\nU20‚Äôs is kinda unfair for those who come from shit nations though. And the other trillion from a very good nation that can‚Äôt get selected.\n\nI think you have likely made this comment without researching the topic first. \n\n\nFinalists in the last ten tournaments include:\n\n\nUruguay, South Korea, Ukraine, Serbia, Portugal, Ghana, Nigeria, Czech Republic...\n\n\nI'll give the u20s one thing, smaller nations have a chance.\n\nThose nations are at least decent. I‚Äôm talking even a few steps lower on the FIFA ladder. \n\nAlso, a lot of those national teams use local talents, not those of big clubs. Look at the African youth teams for example. The big club talents need their tournament as well imo (and let clubs like Auckland just compete without restrictions to make it even more fun, they‚Äôre fricking semi-pro)\n\ni think this for all international football too. it should only be for guys who get less game time like the olympics teams\n\nLet's just call it what it is.... A chance for the Saudi clubs to play real football teams. Let's not pretend its for the good of world football.\n\nSooooo looking forward to the world cup there! It will be like Qatar, but with less freedom.     \n\nI'm glad I watched the Qatar final, it was one of the best matches in history. I'm also glad I didn't watch another second of this advertisement fiesta for a crooked Monarchy. And I'll do the same in Saudi Arabia.     \n\nIf the big league's countries would be sane, they'd found a new FIFA. But WITHOUT blackjack and hookers.\n\nIn fact, forget the blackjack!\n\nAnd what's wrong with that?\n\nScum is easily spotted\n\nI'm just happy with soccer being a vehicle to bring countries together despite the cultural and ethical differences, that's all.\n\nSportswashing is the term you're looking for\n\nAnd I fail to see what's wrong with trying to find one way, be it sports or something else, to unite everyone.\n\nDid Saudi team won the Asia Champions League?\n\n[deleted]\n\nI mean, I'm pretty sure the host country is just the next World Cup host\n\nWorld Human Rights cup or is it world cup?\n\n If the west does every deal imaginable with them, weapons, oil, McDonald's on their roads, their citizens flood London paris and new York to shop and rent and invest.\n\nBut you draw the line on sporting events.\n\nIt comes off very hypocritical to the 3rd world generally, and just massive cope and virtue signaling \n\n\nI'll get down votes but it's the truth\n\nThere‚Äôs equal outrage at foreign wealthy investors buying up properties (at least in london). You‚Äôre reaching big time with this one.\n\n[deleted]\n\nSo you‚Äôre suggesting that someone who doesn‚Äôt support the human rights abuses of countries like Qatar and Saudi Arabia should do what, protest in the streets to stop people from these countries coming to London, Paris etc.? \n\nNot exactly sure how bringing up their human right abuses is hypocritical at all when it‚Äôs corruption within FIFA that is the cause of this, but enlighten me\n\nThe US fits perfectly with the other lot with abhorrent human rights record.\n\nSo then what‚Äôs the rumpus? Sounds like another pointless soccer tourney in a baddie country. Not the first and certainly won‚Äôt be the last.\n\nIs it being hosted in the USA?\n\nIt sounds cool conceptually but football is just too uneven.\n\nI have thought that the tournament would have been scrapped off by now.¬†\n\nThe problem is, the European teams are so much more dominant than the rest of the world it's not really fair! \n\nIt will never already take off because of that and also everyone knows it's just the money grabbing opportunity for fifa!\n\nGood they should scrap that new format\n\nAll anyone cares about is the best team in Europe and South America. At a stretch Africa and Asia. Just have one, at most, two games of that over a week each year or even every few years and you can maintain some decent interest. But nobody want to sit through a massively overextended past four years of continental winners over a way too long period of games which is oversaturated with clubs which just are not competitive in any sense.\n\nI mean even look at the CL, Chelsea don‚Äôt belong despite winning 4 years ago, and that‚Äôs even worse in competitions with a lower peak performance, especially North America.\n\nI know FIFA are greedy and that‚Äôs literally the only reason they‚Äôre pushing this, but to be so blinded by the potential for money you lose sight of the reality like they have is just foolish. Even if you ignore the footballing side and just looking from a business perspective, the way they have gone about it would be written off by the majority of people who are completely clueless.\n\n‚ÄúI iust wanna see the best teams in Europe v South America‚Äú is kinda how I feel about World Cups too and then 3 days and I‚Äôm watching Senegal v Iran on Tuesday lunchtime\n\nPointless games in, usually, shit time zones at a weird point of the season with huge inequality of talent. What‚Äôs not to love?\n\nPointless tournament , bin it\n\nThey just want to find a way to force Saudi clubs into global competitions. \n\nThis is a farce.\n\nShut it down\n\nuntil this post id forgotten the club world cup was a thing\n\n\n\ni literally couldnt tell you the result of a single game or if a season had even started or completed\n\nHow are we supposed to care about an unwanted and ill-conceived regurgitation of a previous failed cynical cash grab?\n\nDumb idea and just an Infantino cash/power grab.\n\nSo the golden goose only has so many eggs?\n\nnot sure if I'd find it funnier if they have to scrap that tournament because noone gives a shit or if they actually do the tournament but have empty stadiums and no TV viewership\n\nI prefer one off matches in some neutral venue.\n\nIntercontinental Cup was great, but reality is in the last 20 years or so it's become highly unbalanced with Europe taking all the Southamerican talent young.\n\nWhat a waste of time. Sack it off!\n\nJust bin it bro.\n\nThey should make it a 5 or 7-a-side tournament so that players can be rotated and run lesser.\n\nGood! So, maybe, just maybe, there‚Äôs something good that‚Äôll come out of UEFA‚Äôs new shitty CL format, and that is scrapping the club wc. But I doubt FIFA will leave it here though.\n\nJust put 1 from each continent (6 teams) and have the former final continents get a pass on the first match.\n\nExample, Europe and South America were the 2 finalists in the last tournament,so they get a pass. N.America,Africa,Asia and Oceania champions play 1 match each (NA - Afr ,Asia-Ocenia , it's a lottery for the matches) . From them we have the semi final of Europe - NA and SA - Asia and from there the final. You want more games,the losers play for ranking then.\n\n...\n\nYou want more teams?\n\nEach continent sends the Champions League and Europa League winners (according the the continent's cups of course) and have 12 teams (or if a continent doesn't have a secondary cup send just the main) and have the same way of playing (Finalists get a pass,so 10 teams and semi finalists get a pass,so 8 teams. And go accordingly).\n\n...\n\nThe 20 teams League will kill the Cup, since Real Madrid for example will have (approximate numbers) 38 League games,4 cup (RM will never get the Spanish cup,so I put semi or final match),16 Champions League marches,10 World cup matches. So we found the results at approximately 70ish matches,maybe 80 . How exactly are they supposed to have the best of their Line-up for 80 fucking matches. Even if we say that the main lineup plays for 40-50 matches,that still means 15 players have to play all of them at 100% plus their nationals. \n\nThat's INSANE!!!\n\nWhy they won't get Spanish cup?\n\nIt's a joke about RM always losing the cup much of the time to far weaker teams.\n\nThat's true üòÇ\n\n[removed]\n\nBut why should we gaf about ‚Äòtop clubs‚Äô from other continents? What difference does make to European clubs whether these clubs get exposure or attention?\n\nFootball wise is irrelevant, that‚Äôs what people hate about it\n\nToo bad. I was definitely interested in it.\n\nProbably wasn't going to actually watch it due to time difference issues, but would've been interested and may've watched future editions if time difference was less of an issue.\n\nI was somewhat interested. Simply because anything sounds like any improvement over the old format.\n\nEveryone already knows that whoever wins the Champions League is the best in the world. This tournament is just a pointless money making exercise, prime FIFA shite with some human rights violations thrown in.\n\nI don't understand how people don't like this. Once every 4 years, the best teams from all over the globe. Playing a proper tournament format. Fills the gap when there's no international tournament. New trophy for clubs to play for. I'm excited about it.\n\nI'm super excited for it. What you have here is Europeans who life off of South American and some African talent having prejudice against the teams that revealed their top players.¬†\n\n\nFrance is joked as being Africa United. Argentina won the last World Cup.¬†\n\n\nReal Madrid's best player of last season is Brazilian. Their \"magic 4\" includes 2 Brazilians.\n\n\nBarcelona's famous MSN were all South Americans.\n\n\nThis all boils down to racists being racists.¬†\n\nIt's not that deep. It just doesn't mean anything to anyone.\n\nThe gap doesn‚Äôt need filling. In fact there aren‚Äôt enough gaps as it is. \n\nIt‚Äôs not the best teams from all over the world, that‚Äôs the European Champions League. This is big teams from Europe being dragged to the other side of the world to boost shitter teams from Asia, the Middle East and Africa, to make Infantino some more money and increase his political influence with oil states. \n\nThere is nothing in this for the actual top clubs other than a bit of cash, but the cost of attending will be felt in their other ‚Äòreal‚Äô competitions.\n\nAre Barca fans excited about playing Al Kebab in Oman? No, why would they be?\n\nI also had to call an emergency meeting with my team of one to discuss the lack of interest in my new product, the vanilla covered phone case. \nMuch like this club world cup, my product was also put into production without anyone asking for it or having the slightest interest.\n\nContinental Cup,\n\nUEFA too! scrap that. just use old format.\n\nIf my team isn‚Äôt playing in it - I never know exactly when it is, except if my teams game is postponed because of the opponent participating. It‚Äôs in winter, innit? ‚Ä¶\n\nIs it not as FIFA want to wrestle some control and finance from the powerhouse of UEFA and European football\n\ngee i wonder why\n\nThe club world cup is just an afterthought for the clubes who win the champions league, of course, but its the holy grail for teams outside of europe. The gap is so massive and its been growing every year but with the old format there is always a chance that a David will show up and slay the Goliath. I hate the new format because it insures that no team outside of europe will ever win it again, because no team from another continent is gonna have the same depth and quality to be able to beat em. Thats what was beautiful about the last format, it allowed for upsets and for the best moments in some clubes histories.\n\nBring the old format back.\n\nScarp it!\n\nlol\n\nNo shit\n\nI didn't even know there was such a thing already\n\nI completely forgot it existed\n\nIt's big/popular in South America, not really anywhere else\n\nI thought it was renamed to Mundial de Clubes, already.\n\n\"More games lads\" is going to be the suggestion.\n\nNah fuck that, let us get the bag first.¬†\n\nFIFA are used to getting their way. Probably a huge shock to them that rich European clubs are also used to getting their way and in club football those clubs have much more power than FIFA\n\nI just want to see the Colombian ~~mamis~~ Games\n\nDitch it, seems like most obvious one to cut for player safety\n\nI'm losing interest in football in general... I use to be so excited to watch big games but now it's like oversaturated overdone big game on every day means no game is the big game\n\nToday I feel disinterested.\n\nTranslation: FIFA couldnt secure TV rights deals because they expected World Cup money for a glorified friendly tournment\n\nYou could reinstate champions league only for champions on each continent and get the best 4 teams from each continent battle it out somewhere in June to get the world champion.\n\nLoooool\n\nIf we have to get 32 best teams in the world, probably 30 comes from Europe and 2 from South America. The Asian champion will struggle at a relegation battle in the Premier League. This so called Club World Cup will never have the integrity of a real world Cup.\n\nGet the eFootball licence!\n\nThey should bring back confederations cup\n\nThis has 0 interest.\n\nIt's very hard to make people give a shit when there's no history.\n\nBring the old format back! And no, I am not saying this because everyone in Brazil loves to shit on Palmeiras (I am a palmeirense, and dealing with all the \"o Palmeiras n√£o tem Mundial\" jokes is a very tiresome thing). I am saying this because I believe that, in four years, a club can potentially go from winning a continental championship to being relegated, and let's face it: nobody wants to see a club outside of the top flight division of its country in a world championship.\n\nTbh just send reserve players. It's not like FIFA can force say Real Madrid to bring their best players.\n\nJust make it a 1 game thing cl vs copa winner\n\nIt's another pointless tournament. The players are already overloaded\n\nI can save you a meeting, guys:\n\nLiterally no-one cares about it and they never will.\n\nJust keep the current format. It‚Äôs essentially a supercup\n\nI mean, who gives a shit really? \n\nI think in a world where there are fewer returns financially on tournaments (less prize money in champions league, lack of tv interest for Ligue 1) it doesn‚Äôt even make money sense to host a *bigger* club World Cup. It barely makes sense to run it as is. \n\nAs an Aussie, I will be the first to say that obviously stadiums will sell out in countries like Australia, or Japan, the USA, or maybe Mexico if you think about the reputation comparably between our leagues and bringing in City for a few games, for example. A lot of football fans have what we call ‚Äòeurosnobbery‚Äô which is a bias against any domestic football because Europe is ‚Äòbetter‚Äô. So, be wary of ‚Äòfact checking‚Äô this by looking at league attendances, we pretty consistently sell out friendlies between European teams so that wouldn‚Äôt be a problem, I would imagine a lot of Asian nations are the same. That being said, most of you aren‚Äôt familiar with having to get up at stupid hours in the morning to watch clubs you support like we do, so the tv deals (the real money makers) are going to be worth fuck all unless hosted in Europe. \n\nI can‚Äôt imagine it‚Äôs at all profitable, nor has it ever been.\n\nFifa's way of making more money and distribute amongst themselves. Just like Blatter, the greed for money.\n\nSince players are paid well, they figure that they can play more.\n\nHigh time they reign in these ridiculous payouts.\n\nCancel forever!\n\nMost Brazilian teams already play close to 80 games a season I highly doubt they want to to play even more in some useless tournament.\n\nthey do want to play.\n\nmore money, more visibility, a chance to beat an european juggernaut (ask any fan or player from S√£o Paulo, Internacional or Corinthians if they didn't love to win). also, playing this tournament means that they had an excelent season, considering it requires a Libertadores title.\n\nThese are the reasons why players complain. Too many matches, UEFA is killing the game\n\nDo it, but offer it to 12 highest ranked European teams which are not playing in Europe that year. This year it would be¬†West Ham, Napoli, Sevilla, Marseille, Rennes Basel, Freiburg, Union Berlin, Leicester, Antwerp¬† Lech Poznan and Brighton...\n\n\nI think that could be a really fun one! Much more competitive and the European clubs may actually take it seriously under such arrangement.¬†\n\nThey‚Äôre not interested in fun, they‚Äôre interested in making money and boosting oil state clubs off the back of Real Madrid, Liverpool, the Milans etc.\n\nSee this is the best suggestion I've heard. Players aren't loaded as much, and it will be more competitive.\n\nThis should be a very short and simple tournament. Have the European champion in the final already and let the other confederations battle it out.\n\nSo basically the current format hahah\n\nnoooo i wanna see Inter in the US. \n\nAlso - Maybe it won't THAT popular but I think Americans would go.\n\nNo fans give a flying toss about the club World Cup. I hope it tanks.\n\nScrap League Cup, UEFA Nations League and the Club World Cup. No one cares about any of these and the players are being run into the ground.\n\nwhat do you think the nations league is\n\nHave it once every 4 years like the proper world cup. That year where theres like no continental (international) trophy or world cup will do, have it on freeview like the actual world cup (to build up viewership) and have it to where the top few teams that reach maybe the semi final stage of the year befores champions league equivalent tournement. Idk how many teams it is its just an idea that will not be used.¬†\n\nIt just don‚Äôt.\n\n[removed]\n\nToday I am all of the above, apparently.\n\nI liked it in old format, where just champions play against each other, new format is kinda crap, just gonna be mini ucl after groups\n\nI just hate gingers.¬†"

    "all_comment_text": "\"after Chelsea ace _was promoted to vice-captain_\"\n\nChelsea fan who thinks Enzo should have been punished. \n\nBut I don't think whataboutism is a valid defence for racist behaviour.\n\nFrom what Ive seen on coys, the vibe isn‚Äôt mad that he‚Äôs punished. It‚Äôs moreso why was he the only one punished.\n\nAnd the severity of the ban. Bentancur and Son have addressed this and moved on. Yes it should still be punished but 7 games?!?! \n\nKudus just got 3 games (after a review) for punching 3 of our players!\n\nThe timing of it, too. Funny how they announce it before the most jam packed scheduling in the season.\n\nI mean it's pretty clear. Homophobic, anti-French and anti-black sentiment is fine with the people making the decisions. It's as simple as that. Notice it became Enzo and not his entire team, even that shows how it got swept under the rug.\n\nBentancur directly targeted a money maker for the league. When you start possibly affecting bank accounts,  they'll start to give a fuck.\n\nUhhh remember when Cavani got 3 games for using the Spanish word for black? Wasn't even racism and they suspended him. Anti-black sentiment is fine my ass. Typically it's Asians who\nface racism and are expected to accept it. Hilariously out of touch comment.\n\nI'm a United fan, I used to sing the Park Ji-Sung chant all the time. It didn't even register in my mind that it might offend him until he made a statement. I felt a bit guilty tbh. I always liked him as a player, and he seems a decent bloke.\n\nAgreed here, racism against Asians are so overlooked it hardly gets a peep\n\nSpurs fans are focusing on Enzo instead of the entire team for a reason. But they fundamentally are right, he and the team should have been punished appropriately.\n\n[deleted]\n\nI meant they are focusing on him instead of the other Argentinians.\n\nOh ok fair enough apologies\n\nNo problems\n\nNot defending it at all. Bentancur deserves the ban. The problem is that he's been banned, and Enzo has been promoted.\n\nIn my mind there is no problem with Bentacur being banned. That is what should be happening. \n\nThere is a problem that Enzo wasn't. \n\nEnzo being promoted is irrelevant to either of those things, it's club led, not association led. It's not like the FA has said he should be promoted because of his actions. I do think Chelsea has issues internally if he was promoted so quickly after the incident, as it's a fucking PR nightmare.\n\nIt's a pretty clear double standard.¬†\n\nWho is suggesting it isn't? \n\nEnzo if everything was fair would have been punished. That doesn't mean everyone should get away with being racist.\n\nIm not sure he has https://punchng.com/updated-epl-maresca-names-chelseas-caicedo-vice-captain/\n\nJohn Terry must be so proud.\n\nIs he? I saw some rumours he was but nothing concrete and another article saying Caicedo is\n\nCalling Enzo a \"Chelsea Ace\" is a bit much üòÇ  He's more of a 5 of ‚ô£Ô∏è\n\nI know people complain as Son didn't take offence but the ruling should never be based on that - there would be unspoken pressure to never complain about a teammate or else the club suffers. A harsh ban sends a clear message but there's got to be consistency. At SoL, we had to get the police to follow up on a racist incident as the club and stewards didn't care at all. Rudiger got absolutely no support. There were fans a few years ago signing on a bus that Levy was a Jew, recorded and published and nothing happened. Just because racist incidents often aren't handled this harshly in England, doesn't mean our leagues don't have serious issues.\n\nIt has been shown with Park. He didn't say anything about his song while playing and only told fans to stop singing it for others when he was retired. Going against fans/teammates is usually quite difficult to do.\n\nFans still sing it to this day - as a United fan it makes me cringe! From the stereotype of Koreans, to shitting on low income households, etc.\n\nas a scouser i can live with the council house rat thing but thats gotta feel a different type of shitty that your own fanbase reduces your country to \"eating dogs\"\n\nYeah it‚Äôs about setting a precedent. Asian people are under represented in football as it is and allowing Bentancur to get away with comments made towards the most prominent Asian player in world football would send the wrong message.\n\nPersonally I think the scale of the punishment is a bit OTT but I‚Äôm fine with it as long as the FA apply consistent punishments for future offenders.\n\nHow are they underrepresented?\n\n0.4% of the UK population is South Korean.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asians_in_the_United_Kingdom\n\n0.8% of players in the football league are South Korean.\n\nhttps://www.transfermarkt.com/premierleague/gastarbeiter/wettbewerb/GB1\n\n Asian people only exist in the UK news to me!\n\nHow are Asians under represented in football? What about all of those Asian players who play in Asia? Are they not \"representing\"?\n\nYou‚Äôre being purposefully obtuse here. Obviously there are tons of Asian footballers playing in the Asian leagues, but who tf currently follows those leagues outside of Asia?\n\nIn the top European leagues Asian players are a tiny minority and when you reduce it even further to just the top 7 or 8 clubs from each of those leagues there are literally a handful of Asian players at those clubs.\n\nYeah because most of them aren't good enough to make it to the top flight. What about Americans? Are they under represented?\n\nThis is such a pointless discussion. I'm not talking about why there aren't as many Asian footballers as other ethnicities, that's totally beside the point.\n\nThere are relatively few top-level Asian footballers, Son is the most prominent of those few, Bentancur made a stupid racist remark towards him and is being rightfully punished. Anything else is a different discussion entirely.\n\nLevy is a Jew? Lmao what?\n\nI‚Äôm Asian and sometimes I think some of my friends look the same.\n\nyou are right, it shouldn't be about if Son was offended, it should be about if the person who said those words had the intention to offend anyone, which he clearly didn't.\n\nJust like Ricky Gervais once said \" Just because you are offended, doesn't mean you are right\".\n\nWho decides if it was meant as a joke or not? Every racist person could just say it was a joke. It's also about the impression people have. If kids see his comments and think it's ok they'll go round to classmates or whatever saying they all look the same as a \"joke\"\n\n\"Jokes\" are fine behind closed doors between friends, but when you're in the public eye what you say carries so much weight and you should be much more careful who you say these things to.\n\n14 year olds can apply better logic to systems of oppression than ricky gervais mate\n\nPretty sure Ricky Gervais was talking about mundane stuff and not racism\n\nI'm pretty sure he was talking about a bunch of stuff, racism included. That's kind of his thing.\n\nThere's nothing more mundane than racism.\n\nNo, Gervais is a bigot. He hates¬†minorities and vulnerable populations and wants them all harmed\n\n14 years old can write better comments for like, agree, and so do you. But people who don't care still apply real worlds logic.\n\nyou don't know there would be unspoken pressure. that is your assumption.\n\nNo, that's why unions and independent panels exist. Because situations like this have unspoken weight against victims.\n\nYou think a game where millions of dollars are on the line wouldn‚Äôt have clubs pressuring players?\n\nI'm going to assume that you are white or at least not a minority in the country you are living. As a minority - and someone who also knows a lot of minorities - yes the pressure is there and will always be there.\n\n[removed]\n\nanytime i need reminding about the left wing, hand wringing, navel gazing hive mind that is reddit, i get a fresh reminder like this longwinded response. to repeat nearly everything you say is an assumption based on preconceived social ideology you have applied. If Son didn't take offence, he didn't take offence. Simple. Trust left wingers to contort themselves into pretzels to be offended on other people's behalf. Suppose in their minds, gives themselves a sense of personal identity.\n\nhttps://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/ijmhsc-01-2016-0003/full/html\n\nBut what Bentancur did is not even as harmful as Enzo.\n\nThought the minimal for racism was 10\n\nOnly for Uruguayans\n\nBentancur is uruguayan\n\nI mean Kudela told Kamara that he's an ape, there never was an ounce of evidence to prove it so they gave him \"minimal penalty\" of 10 games.\n\nWhat a meme.\n\nSlavic tax\n\nBut Bentancur is uruguayan üò≠\n\nIt's fair enough. You can't say that, and it's a stupid thing to say about your own team mate\n\nUnrelated really but random thought I just had: did Darwin get anything for literally fighting fans in that Uruguay Colombia game? Remember the classic ‚Äúhe‚Äôs gonna be banned for a year!‚Äù And not seen anything since.\n\nBanned for 5 international games\n\nWas that the incident where he was about to throw a chair at the fans but someone grabbed it of his hands at the last second?\n\nI think he got the shot away but it was blocked and went into the wall\n\nOh wow you have an excellent memory: https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1e0g5i8/pov_of_darwin_nunez_throwing_a_chair/\n\nHaha I‚Äôll be fair I spent like an hour on a wwe edit for a friend so I‚Äôve seen the clip 30000 times\n\nHe was handed a ban before successfully appealing.\n\n5 games after Copa. Both he and Bentancur started the 3rd place match, and Bentancur scored the opener.\n\nLike with Enzo F, it's a FIFA matter, or rather CONMEBOL, not UEFA or the FA that would get involved. Purely international games affected, and afaik it was appealed.\n\nWhy are the media acting like it was Enzo alone involved? Not half of the team lol?\n\nBecause only Enzo can be confirmed to be singing in the video\n\nThe way he was scapegoated was shocking. He was the only one who was investigated by his team and all that stuff and yet he‚Äôs the one constantly dragged. Forgiven by his teammates but not a word about anyone else.\n\nLol when did he get forgiven? And who apologised on behalf of everyone?\n\nBy the likes of Fofana, gusto and Badiashile amongst. A few.\n\nHe spoke to Fofana, and he spoke to Reece James apologizing. Hard to say id he was actually forgiven but there's not been any bustups in the dressing room since it happened\n\n[removed]\n\nThe South Korean national team intentionally swap shirt numbers in training a few years back because they knew Westerners would struggle to tell the difference between players.\n\nNo wonder Son wasn't bothered by Bentacur's comments, he was part of that very same squad.\n\n[https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/44513453](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/44513453)\n\nI read something about this like 10 years ago, but if I remember correctly it is due to different races focus on different facial features when it comes to identifying people. So basically people just go for the same method by default and draw a blank - until they get used to factoring in other features as well. I don't know if any of it is true, but it kinda makes sense if it is.\n\nI doubt it's an actual genetic difference. If a white person grows up in China I doubt they'd have a problem distinguishing Chinese faces, but they might struggle with white faces. I think it's more to do with what faces you're exposed to. If you've seen a million white faces in your life compared to 10 000 Asian you're obviously gonna be \"better\" at analysing white faces.\n\nI never said that it is a genetic difference, it is an exposure difference, I was just explaing it apparently very badly.     \n\nEdit: now that I read it back, I really made it sound like it is more genetical, but what I was trying to say was that growing up in an environment with a specific race being the norm, people learn to distinguish others by specific facial features - but with people from outside their norm (like a completely different race) those same features might not be a good method and your brain might need to rewrite what to focus on. I think it was in some paper with eye-tracking tests supporting the theory.     \nWell, next time I am in a hurry I should probably not try to write something that ends up only as a half-assed comment that can be easily misunderstood.\n\nNot really, just that we are not that unique as we think we are. Humans from the same ethnicity kinda all look the same. Still saying it just typically about son, he never said it or apply the same logic to everyone else, I doubt it's a genuiene innocent joke and imo it was indeed a joke based on stereotype\n\nIt wasn‚Äôt even malicious from him either, he didn‚Äôt mean to insult or hurt son, so I have no idea how a seven game ban has been put in place\n\nYou do know that it‚Äôs possible to be unintentionally racist, right?\n\nNo shit, but surely that should harbour a smaller ban than being intentionally racist\n\nI don‚Äôt think intent or lack thereof should be factored in. There is no real accountability if players get off with a slap on the wrist because ‚Äúoh well he didn‚Äôt mean anything by it!‚Äù\n\nYou don't speak for all Asians, I'm Asian and I don't hold the same views as you and I'm sure majority don't as well.\n\nIt's ok to have different views. I'm just stating my opinion. ü§∑\n\nThen stop saying \"as an Asian blah blah blah\" and make it look like what you say and think applies to all Asians.\n\nBye. Last thing I need is internet aggression.\n\nüò™\n\nI‚Äôm Asian and I approve this message.\n\nThe western world is fucked no more so than the UK. This is a country that has old women and old men in prison for facebook comments. So, it's not hard to understand why something as stupid as this is a big deal to them.\n\nJoe Rogan has entered the chat‚Ä¶.\n\nThis should be top comment\n\nWhy?\n\nYeah,  I find young white women particularly look alike a lot.\n\nStupid thing to say in 2024 - he should have known how people would react. But a 7 game ban is massively over the top.\n\nIf he said a similar thing but towards black people and not Asians he would've got a year ban or kicked from the team. Be real. 7 game ban is fair. Racism is racism and has no place in the sport or life for that matter.\n\nas shown by the year long ban to enzo fernandez. good job.\n\nYou clearly haven't read up on the cases then. I agree it's ludicrous but different governing bodies are investigating the cases. English FA for Bentancaur and FIFA for Enzo. Don't just \"good job\" me without doing your own due diligence and research mate.\n\nI don't know man. If this is \"racism\", what about actual racism? Like discriminating against people, denying them rights etc., which is pretty much ongoing and on the rise even. \n\nIt's a stupid thing to say, and good that he's reprimanded, but something doesn't click right to me here.\n\nThey're both racism...? One is just worse than the other...\n\ni think this one should have a different name. bigotry maybe? (like saying americans are fat or loud, etc). This is not racism. Racism is a lot more evil and I feel like we're diluting the issue by labeling everything as racism.\n\nYes, this is racism. Just because even worse racism exists doesn't make \"lesser\" racism okay.¬†Literally all racism is racist.¬†It's not that¬†complicated bro\n\nI'm gonna be honest, such an obvious (but still shitty and offensive) joke does not deserve a full 7 matches when you can break someone's leg and only get 3. that relation feels very off, imo?\n\nKudus got five games for kicking someone twice, and hitting two people in the face‚Ä¶\n\nPlaying football and getting a tackle wrong is a lot different from racism I can assure you‚Ä¶\n\nI don't understand why people are excusing this sort of behaviour? So what if different forms of incidents have been given shorter bans? Surely it's a good thing to be harshly punished for racist comments? Racism has NO PLACE in this sport or in life.\n\nbecause things like committing tackles with a significantly high risk of serious injury (scissoring through someone's ankles from behind?) is often just a yellow, if even that, and an injury can set someone out of play for months if not even more. if it gets a red it's often 2-3 matches for injuring someone through pure recklesness. so what I'm trying to imply is that a lot of those things have no place in football either. \n\nalso, while racist, is it not different to make a stupid racist joke towards a team mate and assumed friend than for example using it as an insult on the pitch? afaik, he doesn't have a history of racism and similar? if he does, then I'll eat this paragraph, but I've only ever really heard of this case, and it feels very much like they're just making an example of him for it.\n\nWho got the year long ban for saying something similar?\n\nI don‚Äôt think so at all, for what reason have you got to comment on anyone‚Äôs race or appearance when you‚Äôre there to kick a ball around, stick to football, leave commentary to the pundits.\n\n1 game would have been okay.\n\nPretty stupid thing to say about a teammate but banning him is a little over the top. 7 games is fucking insanity\n\nI think a pro footballer missing 7 games for racism is fitting enough. He‚Äôs a role model for kids, if he gets away with this, then they think it‚Äôs okay to say the shit he did as well.\n\nFinally, some common sense.\n\nCommon sense is not punishing racists? I'm gonna go ahead and disagree with your racist opinion there üò¨\n\nLol.  So racist my Filipino wife agrees with me 100%.  In fact, she insightfully stated that this is all a modern day Inquisition.   If you deviate 1% from the rules dictated by the Inquisitors (like yourself) then they must condemn you.  As she says, young people today have no idea what real racism is.  A little joke is nothing more than that.  People need to grow up.\n\nEveryone, pack it up and go home, no more discussing this. This guy's Filipino wife disagrees with it and therefore he can speak for all Asian people and dictate whether or not they should be upset by oft repeated racist jokes\n\n\"I have a Filipino friend, therefore I can't possibly be racist!\"\n\nLoser\n\nYour filipino wife must be good in bed\n\nIt was just a joke, if Son didn‚Äôt care then none of us should\n\nhow it can be racist? as an South East Asian, first few months watching K-Drama in pandemic i still can't remember and confuse the actor face and name, because they look the same üòÇ\n\nThey get offended on your behalf, don't worry.\n\nSame. Now I go back to my earlier dramas and I'm wondering how I couldn't differentiate them.\n\nyeah, i recall it called \"other/cross-race effect\". it happened when we rarely or just meet \"the other races\". i guess we can blame our brain\n\nIt's racist because it's easy likes and easy populism. As I said, it's offense when someone say it as a clear offense, which was not the case.\n\nI'm italian. Telling asian people apart, for me, is more difficult than telling european people apart. I don't really understand how saying this (or making a joke about this) could be considered racist. I'm thinking of someone doing the opposite (e.g. any asian person having difficult times telling europeans apart) and I would never be offended. Can you please explain me what's offensive in what he said? I must be missing something...\n\nIt seems today that talking about race in most scenarios is considered racist, even when it isn't. In this case, it meets the minimum requirement for racism. I doubt any South Korean people are truly offended by this joke.\n\nI'm going to give it a go. I don't think it's racist to say \"I personally find it difficult to tell Asian faces apart because i haven't seen many Asians in my life\", because that's just a statement of fact about your own abilities. But that's not the same as saying \"all Asians look the same\" because now you're attributing some negative quality to Asians that's not actually true.\n\nIt‚Äôs woke nonsense essentially\n\nIs the Daily Star even remotely a quality source of news?  When I clicked the link a breaking news headline was WW3 was starting as Ukraine has an atomic bomb.\n\nI think it‚Äôs an over-punishment. He made a careless joke, apologized, was publicly chastised, it has been dragged on and on and now a *seven* game ban?  Why the pound flesh? Son has shown the grace to move on I don‚Äôt know why the FA feel its needs to go the public virtue signalling route.\n\nThe reason why he‚Äôs getting the ban handed to him right now is simple. They play City next week.\n\nAs a spurs fan I absolutely think he should be punished regardless of the fact that he and Son have spoken and moved past it. I have an issue that both were not punished.\n\nJust open it all up and let it all be cool I say it‚Äôs just bants\n\nThe irony of the imperialist English, it was a joke relax ya cunts\n\nRead that in billy butcher, bravo chap!\n\nMeanwhile Enzo got a promotion to vice captain, tbf this is about as consistent as refereeing in the league has been recently üò≠\n\nWhat the fuck did he say that was so bad?\n\n&gt; The midfielders responded with, ‚ÄúSonny‚Äôs?‚Äù He then continued to say that ‚ÄúIt could be Sonny‚Äôs cousin too as they all look the same.\n\nüòÇüòÇüòÇ Come on lad, you should‚Äôve known better. Also fun fact, white people also all look very similar to Asians. And tbh Son has a really distinct, cute face.\n\n[deleted]\n\nYes because it‚Äôs ‚Äúracist.‚Äù\n\nIt is though\n\nPlease explain\n\nThere used to be a difference between ignorance and racism.\n\nIf there's no longer a difference, I take none of this seriously.\n\nIgnorance is a teachable situation. A place where we all can learn.\n\nRacism comes from hatred. I have a hard time believing Betancur is racist.\n\nA seven game ban for words is laughable and pathetic. There's nothing productive that comes from this. It seems order is more important than education in the view of the FA.\n\nIt definitely doesn't make me want to watch the product more, and I don't view anyone better off from this.\n\nGetting offended on other people's behalf, classic.\n\nNon Spanish speaking ppl don't even understand what he said.\n\nI am struggling to understand how is this racist. I bet for Koreans some European nations with homogenous population also look the same\n\nAlso, young Koreans are incredibly conformist (no beard, same haircut and clothes) so they DO look similar. Aesthetic surgery is also very common and everyone wants to achieve the same look\n\nThe Cross-Race Effect has been studied in various different populations and everyone basically concludes it's a real thing for everyone.\n\nI bet you struggle every day\n\nIf he‚Äôs getting a 7 game ban why don‚Äôt enzo banned for the whole season.\n\nIt's because Chelsea is owned by a billionaire, anyone with common sense can see that.\n\nIt's absolutely right that he get punished for what he did. Whether you think seven games is the tight punishment is a complex, multi-faceted question, with no real right or wrong answer.\n\nWhat's not right is that Enzo Fernandes got away with the exact same thing based on a technicality, and the Premier League chose to drag its feet on giving Bentancur the ban, until right until the lead up to the busiest period of the year. You don't get to pick and choose when you give punishment with the goal of causing maximum disruption. We've known the ban was coming for ages, it could (and should) have been implemented a long time ago.\n\nThe West has gotten so sensitive‚Äîthey‚Äôre offended on our behalf! What‚Äôs wrong with what he said? Before I met a bunch of white people, I honestly thought everyone looked the same. Until we spend time around people from other races, it‚Äôs pretty hard to tell people apart since we haven‚Äôt learned to notice the differences yet. If I showed you two lions or two tigers, could you tell them apart every time without spending some time around them?\n\nIt‚Äôs a strange one as legally racism is defined as ‚ÄúAny incident/crime which is perceived by the victim or any other person to be motivated by hostility or prejudice based on a person‚Äôs race or perceived race‚Äù in the U.K.  not saying it was right what we he said but surely the Argentines fit into that bracket.\n\nScot-free?\n\nThee Point Lane can‚Äôt get a break!\n\nThis is all very Spursy\n\nI think these two things are different, bentancur made a silly joke (and yes was racist and offensive, which deserves a ban) \n\nWhat Enzo and his team mates did was a racial hatred in song form, and I think is worse.\n\nIm an Arsenal fan , so have no skin really in this , but it seems that probably Enzo should get double whatever Bentancur gets , though I don't know what I would give for either .\n\nThe jurisdiction bit by the PL and FA is a cop out as well , he brang the game into disrepute by racist chanting , does not matter if they did it on National Team duty or in his local pub, the world has seen it, and the FA / PL should react to it to show it's not acceptable behaviour.\n\nOnly issue is they took so long to ban him, this happened in the summer before the league started\n\nThanks Daily Star for telling us how big a seven-game ban is.\n\nWill the teammates print t-shirts in support of him like Liverpool did with Suarez?\n\nPirates\n\n‚ÄúNo room for racism,‚Äù they say.\n\nAlso Cavani got 3 game ban and 100k fine for using a native word of affection to a teammate that FA which didn't understand thought it was racist.\n\nodd\n\nChelsea fan here‚Ä¶ I want Enzo to stay his ass on the bench and leave in January like the rumors say. We don‚Äôt want a racist in our club.\n\nYour title makes it seem like your thought process is ‚Äúif Enzo got off with no issues why shouldn‚Äôt Bentancur?‚Äú. Which is making you seem like a weirdo. And seven games for being a racist isn‚Äôt ‚Äúmassive‚Äù.\n\nSpurs are shit, Bentancur deserves his ban and Enzo deserves one too.\n\nAll putos are the same\n\nCompared to the enzo stuff, he gets a massive ban for this? Not that it shouldnt be taken seriously, but wow\n\nSon is an irresponsible coon. He should have shut his mouth and let the club deal with it.\n\nIf Son was Jewish oh boyyyy\n\n\nBentancur would be in Rwanda knowing this govenment üòÜ\n\nCrazy decision. It's scientifically proven that other races look the same, and he said it in private ffs.\n\nBentancur. ‚Äúall look the same‚Äú\n\nAce?\n\nFair enough. I think we should have more harsh bans like this one.\n\nUndeserved. He didn't harm anyone. Even Son didn't take offence.\n\nIt ain't racist to say all xxx look the same\n\nChange my mind.\n\nAbsurd ban for such benign comment.\n\nUtter woke nonsense \n\nThey all think we look the same too, it‚Äôs just about what you see regularly so can distinguish different features vs what your brain doesn‚Äôt see very often\n\n-bulldog\n\n'They'\n\nUsed to refer to a group of people (not 1 person!!)\n\n-bulldog\n\nWho is 'they'? You wouldn't generalise about a whole ethnic group because that would just be plain daft, right?\n\nCan you stfu and stop being offended by the smallest things\n\nExplained it in my post, I can generalise because nobody is exempt from the limitations of the human brain \n\n-bulldog\n\nNonsense, bans should only be for on field issues.\n\nIlliterate journalists\n\n&gt; Bentancur later apologised on his Instagram saying ***that is what a*** \"very bad joke.\"\n\nFuck the FA\n\nWhat a bunch of snow flakes...\n\nThis is why I don't watch soccer any more. There's to much politics in soccer."

Unfortunately, you can only win competitions that you are in. \n\nEven if they don‚Äôt go on to win anything else, doing what they have done so far is an incredible achievement and it is just plain wrong to suggest otherwise.\n\n[removed]\n\nNot all trebles are created equal\n\nThey are all equal, just some are more equal than others\n\nSettle down Major.\n\nYou could its their white whale, holy grail\n\nI THINK THAT SOMEONE'S TRYING TO KILL ME\n\n&gt;It‚Äôs not THE treble though\n\nCompletely in agreement here. The fact that RM hasn't won a treble shows how big of an accomplishment it is and it would lose its significance if we start calling any 3 titles the treble.\n\nYeah, I think this is why people were arguing with OP. The people that OP said weren't calling it a real treble were probably just saying it's not THE treble, which is just factually correct. It doesn't take away from Alonso's achievements at all.\n\nWhat if it‚Äôs 3 invincible titles , does that make up for it not being a ucl title?\n\nThat can be it's own treble. The invincible treble.\n\nNah ot not but also close and not any 3 a treble is league europe and domestic\n\nIt's not any 3 titles for the treble real Madrid just hasn't won the treble since they can never win 3 competitions a team that only talks about all the UCLs but has no treble to show. A treble is a domestic league (La Liga, premier league, Liga Portugal, Serie A for example), the main domestic cup(Copa del Rey, FA Cup, Coppa Italia, Taca de Portugal, for example), and of course continental cup, which CAN be the UCL, the Europa League, or the conference league. But sadly, just like Porto's treble from 2003 and 2011, many people don't talk about it. If Leverkusen wins the treble, which is already finishing the Bundesliga undefeated, it would be a GREAT feat and should be more widely recognized. Portos 2 trebles should also be recognized.\n\n# Coppa Italia\n\nit is a treble?   than ive won treble yesterday as well\n\nplayed the settlers, wizard and one more cardgame\n\ndidnt play Champions League or buli, but i can win only the competitions i am in, right?\n\nright?\n\nIt's a treble for sure. But not THE treble. Can't reframe facts to make it fit your narrative lad.\n\nStill doesn't down play the fact they've been incredible this season.\n\nThe perfect answer, really. \n\nTHE Treble is the UCL, League title and Cup title. \n\nOf course if Leverkusen was to win Europa League, it would be a treble, but not THE treble.\n\nThere's obviously a huge difference between winning UCL and Europa League.\n\nAgreed, but it would also be maybe the greatest ever treble, certainly if they can do it undefeated. More impressive than City's, which I felt didn't generate much general interest.\n\nThis is an insane take lol. Exclusively because it's Europa not CL. CL is so much bigger. City (and other teams) being so good it was expected doesn't make it a worse win. Why would you punish teams for being good lol\n\nI guess the same reason we are less impressed when the sons of billionaires also become billionaires.\n\nBecause City's treble comes with the huge asterisk that they practically bought the league with their 115 allegations. Plus the fact that a team at City's level at basically everything was going to win it sooner or later.\n\nEven without that, they've been so dominant it wasn't much of a shock.\n\nIt certainly did mean something because people are obsessed with talking about it. Their documentary is one of the top things to watch on Netflix rn. People care and saying they don‚Äôt won‚Äôt change that.\n\nPretty sure Sunderland‚Äôs series, amongst many others, was also successful when it launched, not sure that‚Äôs an indicator of people being ‚Äòobsessed‚Äô.\n\nIt means people are watching? Is that a foreign statistic to you?\n\nI watched Reacher on Prime, but that watching didn‚Äôt translate into obsession.\n\nI didn‚Äôt know there was a documentary made about it to be completely honest\n\nI understand, not everyone can afford Netflix. It‚Äôs getting pricey.\n\nI‚Äôd rather have Disney+ or prime than Netflix, not that I can‚Äôt afford it just dont care enough for the titles on there to pay for it\n\nIf they win the treble undefeated it would definitely be more unexpected than City‚Äôs, Utd‚Äôs, Barcelona‚Äôs etc. Will it be more impressive? Who knows but definitely more unexpected.\n\nSorry, Leverkusen winning the Europa, Bundesliga, and German Cup would be the greatest treble ever?\n\nThat feels mental to me.\n\nI can see the logic because of the fact that they aren't the biggest or richest. \n\nSort of like how Leicester winning the Prem could be said to be the greatest premiership win ever despite it not being the biggest points tally etc.\n\n&gt; Sorry, Leverkusen winning the Europa, Bundesliga, and German Cup would be the greatest treble ever?\n\nRecency bias has made them delusional it‚Äôs embarrassing\n\nIf they do it undefeated you don‚Äôt think it would go down as one of, if not *the* greatest treble of all time?\n\nGoing undefeated in the league is one hell of an accomplishment and you add two cups to that? I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs up there.\n\n&gt;If they do it undefeated you don‚Äôt think it would go down as one of, if not *the* greatest treble of all time?\n\nNo, because the treble doesn't include the UCL. It would definitely be great though, just not the greatest.\n\nThe Europa league semis in terms of quality isn‚Äôt THAT far off the UCL imo\n\nIt‚Äôs more of Real City and kind of PSG Arsenal, with their squads, making the gap in quality. \n\nLiverpool West Ham Leverkusen Atalanta Milan Roma Marsielle Benfica‚Ä¶..are clubs that would at the very least hold their own against the quarter final UCL clubs\n\nIf they do it undefeated, I think you could make the argument yea\n\nMore impressive than city isn't saying anything. People already need to be reminded city even did a treble only a year on.\n\nBut aside from that. My recommendation to any Leverkusen fan is to just smile and glide on by anyone who wants to cast shade on your season or caveat how incredible it has been.\n\nLeverkusen's season is one of greatest achievements in modern football, and debating exactly where it ranks is for pub bores only.\n\nLeverkusen have had a very impressive season but even if they did win the treble it would not be anywhere near the greatest ever. Let's be real, the bundesliga is pretty weak right now and the europa league is far easier to win than the champions league.\n\n&gt;but it would also be maybe the greatest ever treble, certainly if they can do it undefeated.\n\nNo, it would have to include the UCL to be considered as the greatest ever. It's certainly great though.\n\nThis UCL being in THE treble is a new thing with Man U being the first time it was mentioned. Any league title with 2 cups is the treble what else do you want to call it. As a rangers fan we have many treble‚Äôs before the UCL was even a thing and Celtic won a quadruple treble when we were relegated as much as it pains me to say. They are all valid trebles as long as the league title is involved. Liverpool won a cup treble in 2001 and it has always been referred to as such.\n\nIf they come out and beat the ucl winners tho in the super cup, then hats off\n\nYup\n\nSame as hattrick is germany is a perfect hattrick here. 3 bicycle kick goals wouldnt count in germany.\n\nNot sure this is true, I think in Germany the difference is they only count a hattrick if it‚Äôs scored in the same half.\n\nAlso in a row. At least that's how I learnt it. Although I think it's considered a pure Hattrick in this case.\n\nJesus, what else? Does the wind have to be blowing a certain direction too?\n\nThe opponent is not allowed to score in between\n\nNo, both would be a Hattrick in Germany. Not a \"lupenreiner Hattrick\", but still a Hattrick.\n\nFairs im just going off the news articles we get everytime kane nets 3 a game\n\nThe poor man's treble.\n\nLiverpools 00/01 treble was even cheaper: League Cup, FA Cup and UEFA Cup\n\nManchester United 2016/2017 was the real treble:\n\nEFL Cup\n\nCommunity Shield\n\nEuropa League\n\nThe destitute man's treble.\n\nThe temu treble\n\nNot THE treble, but nonetheless still a European treble\n\nWhat an incredible answer üëè\n\nThe treble is defined as CL, League and highest award domestic cup. You can win a treble without it being *the* treble.\n\nMourinho won the carabao cup, community shield and Europa league treble.\n\nLOL. I was at the League cup final. No one in their right mind is calling that a treble but point taken. üòÇüòÇ\n\nIt is a treble, it's not the \"classic\" one.\n\n  \nImo, you cannot compare the UCL treble with the Europa league treble, even tho they are both incredible achievements\n\nIMO, a treble (in Europe) consists in winning an association's top division, one of the domestic cups (national cup or league cup) and one continental competition (Champions, Europa or Conference). \n\nBUT, of course, there are different kinds of trebles.\n\n- THE TREBLE: league + national cup + Champions\n\n- Minor trebles:\n    - league + league cup + Champions\n    - league + national cup + Europa\n    - league + national cup + Conference\n    - league + league cup + Europa\n    - league + league cup + Conference\n\n/thread\n\nWhere is national cup+league cup+continental competition?\n\nThe classic definition of treble always include the league title.\n\nCalling people who disagree with you ‚Äòbraindead‚Äô makes your argument worthless. Theres absolutely a case to be made for it not being a treble. Why not just present the question like a normal person without being a complete dickhead?\n\nBut don't get it twisted. They do it unbeaten, in my books, it's a bigger achievement than the treble.\n\nPlenty of teams have done the treble. One even did the sextuple.\n\nBut not a single one of em went unbeaten the entire season. Not one.\n\nTwo did the sextuple*\n\n&gt;One even did the sextuple.\n\nBarca also did it. So that's 2 teams\n\nExactly, I think this is far more impressive than the treble but at the end of the day, it‚Äôs just not THE treble.\n\nOf course not. I think anyone that makes the argument that it is is an idiot.\n\nJust that anyone undermining it is a much bigger idiot.\n\nExactly. Going unbeaten and winning a treble as a team with a much lower budget than Madrid, Barca, City etc had is absurdly impressive.\n\nIt‚Äôs not THE treble. The other treble would be more impressive, but there‚Äôs a lot of other highly impressive aspects of their season.\n\nTotally agree, their undefeated record is actually more impressive than the treble. Let's not mess about, nothing compared to Arsenal's Invincibles where they drew 12 games.\n\n&gt; But not a single one of em went unbeaten the entire season. Not one.\n\nNeither did they, the season aint over yet.\n\nBigger underachievement because they did so by beating powerhouses like Qarabag and West Ham? No disrespect but the path to the EL is nowhere near the path to the CL. Anyway, they still have a long way to go before they can claim an unbeaten season.\n\nIt's impressive but the UCL treble will always rank higher\n\nFC Porto went unbeaten in the league in 2011/12. Do you mean in all competitions?\n\nThe sextuples were done in a calendar year, not in a single season.\n\nIts an amazing achievement for sure, but winning every game in a UCL campaign is an insane feat as well for example. Going unbeaten in the EL is so much easier than going unbeaten in the UCL. Playing Liverpool, Atalanta or Milan is hard. Playing Arsenal, Bayern, Real, Barca or Inter is way harder. If you don't compete with the best of the best your achievement will have a dent in it.\n\nYea sure but then again by your logic, only teams that have gone unbeaten domestically can even hold a candle to Leverkusen.\n\nHeres a newsflash. There aren't that many of em. \n\n&gt;your achievement will have a dent in it.\n\nCan't dent a record mate. That's not how it works\n\nNot a single team has achieved the only wins in all competitions including the Champions League. So Football hasnt been completed (and even then you could argue letting in 0 goals etc). So there is always the possibility to \"upgrade\". Now as far as Im concerned winning the treble is enough. You have peaked as a team and no one can ever deny you. BUT you need to do this against the best of the best of the best. Europe League is just not the Champions League. It doesnt matter how you do it.\n\n  \nA team in a weaker competition going unbeaten is as relevant as Ronaldo or Messi scoring 100 goals in MLS or Saudi league. Its just not the same. Its still an amazing achievement, but as I said, there is a slight dent in it, if you want to compare it to the treble winning teams.\n\nHopefully I don't jinx it here but\n\nAn Invincible treble, equals a sextuple feat. Can't change my mind on it even if it's the europa league.\n\nFine, it is A treble. But you must accept that it is not THE treble, and therefore not something many football fans like to refer to. \n\nConsider this. In the future, people might refer back to the season when Leverkusen won the treble. Do you think people will say \"Yeah, remember that season when Leverkusen won a treble\"? Do you see the issue? \n\nThere is nothing disrespectful about it. What Leverkusen is doing is incredible.\n\nI‚Äôll be in the minority then because I will certainly be referring to it as ‚Äúremember the season when Leverkusen won a treble‚Äù üòÇ\n\nWell, me too. The issue from the majority will be if people start saying \"remember the season when Leverkusen won THE treble‚Äù.\n\nDisrespecting or diminishing Leverkusen's feat is wrong. They deserve it, maybe their achievement is even better than the real treble. But all of this doesn't call for changing the definition of what the treble means. Pretty sure we can give Leverkusen proper respect without needing to redefine existing words lol\n\nCouple things , one they have only won the league as of today and not yet unbeaten. \n\nAlso the treble means winning a league , domestic cup and the UCL. The Europa isn‚Äôt the UCL it‚Äôs not the same caliber of teams. \n\nAnother point I like to point out is, u don‚Äôt hear people say Jose won the treble in 2003 as he won the cup,the league and the Europa league . See the distinction he accomplished the same thing there\n\nLeverkusen's treble doesn't exist yet, they've only won the league. Let's discuss this if they manage to win two more titles.\n\nPrecisely, we haven‚Äôt started handing out trophies on form just yet.\n\nI literally said might end up‚Ä¶\n\nIf you use that logic than you have to agree that winning fa cup carabao cup and prem is a treble\n\nBar¬¢a,'s sextete :\nLa liga title\nCopa del Rey (FA)\nSpanish Super Cup (league winer vs FA Cup winer)\nUCL champions\nEuropea Super Cup\nClub World Cup\n\nThat's a real poker of ases \n\n&gt;fa cup carabao cup and prem is a treble\n\nI don't known what that is, would that equal at a national level?\n\nIt's A TREBLE but not THE TREBLE. Sorry.\n\nUCL is the ultimate trophy and that's what gives Treble its credibility. But it's very impressive of Leverkusen and Xabi though\n\nIt would be one of the greatest trebles of all-time given their stature relative to some of the teams they‚Äôre competing against - to win more major trophies in a season than your club has won in it‚Äôs history, with no recent pedigree to suggest that they were on the cusp of doing so, would be incredible. It might not be of a high enough calibre to be a gold-standard treble, should they do it, but for me in this gilded age of superclubs, it would be one of the greatest achievements in modern football.\n\nNo one said it won't be considered a treble, people meant it's not THE treble: UCL, League and Domestic Cup. There's a reason why Liverpool's treble was known as the \"Tin Pot \" or \"Mickey Mouse\" Treble while Ajax, PSV, Man Utd, Inter, Barca and Bayern's treble are more significantly more impressive.\n\nFuck it why don‚Äôt top English teams get relegated and then win the FA cup so that next year they can do the coveted Europa league, championship and carabo cup treble? \n\nLike obviously it‚Äôs a fantastic achievement but the Europa league is a second tier competition. If a team is good enough to win a top 5 league they really should be winning the Europa league by the nature of it. That‚Äôs what makes it not THE treble. And that‚Äôs ok. Like If city crashed out of the CL 4th in group and then walked the Europa league would you have called that the treble then? Obviously not.   \nThe Europa league is literally the competition for teams not good enough to be in the CL of course it‚Äôs not the same. \n\nWinning the league is already an Amazing achievement and if they won the other two it will still be a truly unbelievable season for Leverkusen and it not being the treble doesn‚Äôt make that not true.\n\nNot THE Treble\n\nIt‚Äôs a treble for sure. They win 3 trophies. But it‚Äôs not THE Treble, Champions League is required for that.\n\nNo mate they are not brain dead, you are for thinking the europa league is part of a treble, it is a treble but it‚Äôs not THE treble. You can‚Äôt win fa cup, community shield and league 1 title in England and call it a treble, that‚Äôs not how it works in football terms.\n\nI'd argue that is more impressive than a treble\n\nTheyre right. Its not, officially. But you can add, arguably more kudos, if they go unbeaten throughout all competitions. Thats insane\n\nIt‚Äôs *a* treble, not *the* treble. \n\nStill a great achievement if they can do it.\n\nIts not the treble mate get over yourself\n\nIt‚Äôs a treble. Not THE treble. But that‚Äôs not important is it?\n\nCan they win a golden bundesliga? An entire season unbeaten.\n\nStuttgart and Dortmund are the two big games left. Come on Xhaka!\n\nIt will be a treble, just not THE treble but honestly if you were to ask any Leverkusen fan at the begining of season if they would be happy with a place in the CL they would say yes so all of this js a bonus\n\nSome might refer to it as a Mickey Mouse treble\n\nMy Friend THE TREBLE is your league your Main cup tournament in your country and the Champions league\n\nIt would be a double and also winning the Europa League. Europa League isn't a premier competition. You have to be mid to be in it.\n\nEDIT: Like when West Ham fans sing they're Champions of Europe. Kinda cute, though.\n\nI don't think people are saying it's not a 'real' one, of course it is. But what people traditionally refer to as THE treble is your national league title, your national cup, and your continental title - the three hardest and most prestigious season-long titles in club football. \n\nLeverkusen have their title, and are in the final of their national cup, and looking good in the quarters of the europa league - but the EL is not Europe's continental title, that's the champions league. \n\nThe EL is still a European trophy and winning it is an achievement on its own, let alone winning it as one of two or even three major trophies in a single season - especially if they do it completely unbeaten. I'm not sure any club, anywhere in the world, has ever done that? 3 major trophies in a single season, without losing a single game? \n\nIt won't be The treble if they complete it, but it will still be A treble, and a huge and historic achievement, even if they do lose games between now and the end of the season. \n\nFrankly, even if they don't win anything else and lose every game, it'll STILL be an insane season. But, I don't even support leverkusen, but I still hope they pull it off. They play amazing football, and this would be a totally unprecedented thing if they could do it...\n\nOfc it's a treble, it's just not *the* treble, obviously\n\nYup, but not The Treble. At all.\n\nBy definition yes. Although it's not widely accepted.\n\nFun Fact- \n\nA total of 29 clubs have gone unbeaten in their respective European league seasons since the year 2000. \n\nA total of only 8 clubs have won the continental treble (incorporating the second-tier continental trophy) in Europe.\n\nI don‚Äôt care how you gonna call it.. \nif it doesn‚Äôt contain the CL win it‚Äôs not a treble. It‚Äôs just a bunch of titles. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\n\nIt‚Äôs like a royal flush in a suit of spades, still a royal flush, but there are better royal flush\n\nIt's a treble just not the treble, still very impressive, especially for a club who I see referred to as Neverkusen.\n\nEven if they just win the league, it's still one hell of an achievement to beat Bayern to it, especially in April.\n\nyeah winning the audi cup, joan gamper cup, betway cup is a treble too. Do you think its equal to prem, fa cup, cl or laliga, spanish cup, cl?\n\nThose don‚Äôt count lmao they‚Äôre just obligated to win those out of honor\n\nsoo carabao cup, prem, uecl is the same treble as laliga, spanish cup and cl?\n\nI clearly pointed out that they have the potential of winning the domestic up and a European cup along with the league that they already wrapped nothing about friendly cups mate.\n\nThen if a team wins Laliga, spanish cup, CL equals to Bundesliga, German cup and UEL or Prem, FA cup and \n\n# The Intertoto Cup?\n\nThe good news is, if they continue to win and end up winning this discounted(by others, not me) treble, they can still continue their run of form into next year. I'm not saying I think they would go unbeaten in 2 seasons and win a proper treble on top of it but I think they could very easily make a deep run in the UCL.\n\n  \nThis is a hot take, to piggy back off of this. I think they would beat any team currently competing in the UCL right now. They *might* lose a game and still win on aggregate but honestly I only think Real Madrid or City would be able to pull that off.\n\nIt is a treble but just not the main one.\n\nEither way it's an incredible achievement and one every club/fans would love .\n\nThe fact they haven't been beaten in any game this season is testament to how well they have done.\n\nThey haven‚Äôt done it yet. No need to get excited.\n\nTripletino\n\nEvery Treble counts as a Treble... simple as that...\n\nIf they do it unbeaten... then wow :)))\n\nIt‚Äôs a treble undoubtedly, and it will be more impressive than any CL trebles IF they manages to stay undefeated throughout the entire campaign\n\nWinning 3 trophies is quite impressive, I have enjoyed watching Leverkusen this year.\n\nThe only disrespectful thing here is just assuming that Leverkusen will win them all\n\nI think that would be unfair to prior treble winners of this type. I almost never hear about galatassary 1999 but they were a serious one off that was a great team. I guess few are here to defend them. Maybe the few leverkusen fans on here can defend it, then sure, it's a treble.\n\nSo many butthurt Manchester Shitty fans in the comments who think Leverkusen's treble isn't THE Treble. Well, yes it is, and you guys can't change anything about that.\n\nA question I have would u consider Porto treble winners in 2003 and CSKA treble winners in 2005? Because they have done what leverkusen are on course to do .\n\nBruh why do people care what online folks say. We've never been close to a freaking trophy to judge what a team is winning and how they perceived it\n\nIf they do it again next year with UCL they‚Äôll still say something about it. I like Leverkusen. To those Leverkusen supporters I hope it all works out for you. Congratulations on the title.\n\nAs a Leverkusen supporter: I dont care how people want to call it, I'd be fine winning it with whatever name.\n\nThey have only won 1 competition, chill.\n\nIf you read comment properly you‚Äôd see I‚Äôm talking about their possibility nothing about it certainly happening\n\nI mean, people only seem to care about crazy statistcs and trophies here. I think that plenty of people fail to recognize how hard it is to even stay middle of the table in the decent league. \n\nJust like a lot of people can't understand that you can still be a good striker even if you don't have Ronaldo/Messi/Neymar/Mbappe stats. Football is not just the biggest 4 teams.\n\nIt‚Äôs ‚Äúa‚Äù treble. But not THE treble\n\nIt‚Äôs a treble not the treble.\n\nWhy don't we come up with a new name for this? People will say, this is where it all began:\n\nTreblino\n\nTrebletje\n\nTriple\n\nLittle Treble\n\nSmall Treble\n\nTrELble\n\nTrEuroble\n\nTrio\n\nKleiner Dreier\n\n...\n\nIt is a treble.\n\nIt's not the treble.\n\nLike can yall chill. Lets talk about this if we win it. Counting eggs before they hatch etc.\n\nDoes winning the world football club cup count as well because many UCL winners have gone on to win this after the UCL? Surely the world football club cup or whatever it‚Äôs called is bigger than a European cup?\n\nThey will disrespect undefeated treble? Really?\n\nYes three trophies is a treble. We can all count\n\nSo it's not gay fucking the asshole of a guy because a hole is a hole?\n\nSuch a wonderful team,the management is good,went for the right players in specific positions and got the best out of them in every position..it's a nice team to watch.\n\nIt's a treble 100% right now with the level of teams in Europa league it's not easy to win that specially with a limited squad like leverkusen it's a huge merit.\n\nIt's A treble.\nNot THE treble.\n\nA treble definitely, but not the treble\n\nIs it a treble? Yes. Is it THE treble? No. Simple.\n\nAye man a trebles a treble\n\nInvincible treble if they don't lose\n\nmini treble\n\nA treble not THE Treble. Yea.\n\nI do wonder why people focus so heavily on Leverkusen when Stuttgart is as impressive, having gone from relegation to top 4 in a year\n\nLeverkusen‚Äôs Bundesliga will be an eternal achievement just like Leicester‚Äôs Premiership. These are the moments of triumph that fans will celebrate for the rest of their days.\n\nYou should ask alexander trent-arnold\n\nIt would be a treble but it's not THE treble. Can't be THE treble without the champions league.\n\nIt's a treble*\n\nAs everyone else already said,\nIt‚Äôs A treble, sure, but not THE Treble\n\nIt‚Äôs not THE treble as some others said but It could still be a treble of competition wins where they don‚Äôt lose a single game in any competition including the league. They are mightily impressive regardless. They were around relegation zone when alonso took over. What a job he‚Äôs done\n\nWinning league, cup and UCL is the best treble no doubt.\n\nBut winning Europa is also a treble cause last time I checked,  Europa is also a trophy.\n\nSo yes totally agree.\n\nYou could win the FA cup, carling cup and the league thats also a treble, but that's not \"The Treble\"\n\nIts a treble but it will never have same value as the one achieved by bayern or barca cuz it involves europa league not UCL.\n\nIts a treble, not THE treble, they arent in the champions league why cant people understand that?\n\nImo the unbeaten is far more impressive than the trebles or sextuples. Did any team before did this? Idk\n\nA treble in football terminology generally means ur respective league, the UCL and ur respective cup. \n\nIt‚Äôs a great achievement for them to win three trophies in a season yet it isn‚Äôt the treble because that‚Äôs simply not what it means. \n\nAn example in 2003 Jose won the Portuguese league,cup and Europa league yet nobody calls  that a treble. Because it‚Äôs not what a treble is .\n\nI don't know what mentality these people have and keep. You should give importance to each and everything and everything has its significance in life regardless of how big or small of an event it is. \nBayer Leverkusen deserves their treble winning season and it's a great feat achieved by them and also for the game of football. It's always amazing to win a tournament internationally or domestically doesn't matter.\n\nIf Liverpool's 2000/01 treble is a treble, it's a treble.\n\nIf Liverpool's 2000/01 treble is not a treble, it is not a treble.\n\nI fall into the former camp but know enough people who fall into the latter camp to not fight on the internet over it.\n\nA treble, not THE treble\n\nIt‚Äôs an incredible achievement, but it isn‚Äôt the same achievement winning a European competition with the best 2-3 teams from each league taken out\n\nDoesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not an insane achievement, but you also can‚Äôt repaint it just because you want to feel better about Leverkusen\n\nA treble, yes. \n\nTHE treble, no.\n\nSome countries have 3 domestic trophies but for the treble the league is number one. Liverpool did a cup treble in 2001 I think with the 2 English cups and a European trophy but nobody would call that a treble it‚Äôs always referred to as a cup treble\n\nStill a better treble than the one Real Madrid has.\n\nnot thentreble\n\n\nwinning Audi cup, family poker and bundesliga is not the treble either right?\n\nbut maybe it is, then ive won treble yesterday at boardgame evening.\nbut is it worth to talk about treble there? i dont think so\n\nHaters gonna hate whatever they achieve\n\nInvincible season &gt; The treble. They are on track to win that\n\nIt‚Äôs the same as if an English team won the prem champions league but the league cup not the fa. That‚Äôs still not THE treble. It‚Äôs still massively impressive. And is A treble but just not THE treble.\n\nIt's a treble, but not **the** treble\n\nIt's \"a\" treble not \"the\" treble.\n\nIf Leverkusen wins EL and the DFB Pokal it‚Äòs a treble, if City wins PL, CL and FA it‚Äôs a treble.\n\nI would probably rank Leverkusens treble higher, because it didn‚Äôt took them 7 years under the best coach, 1 billion euro and shitting on FFP.\n\n&gt;If Leverkusen wins EL and the DFB Pokal it‚Äòs a treble, if City wins PL, CL and FA it‚Äôs a treble.\n\nNo. Leverkusen's will be A treble, City's will be THE treble. \n\nJust because we like something more doesn't change the facts.\n\nLeverkusen will have won 3 trophies but not completed the treble as it‚Äôs missing a UCL . Two comparisons for u. In 2005 did CSKA Moscow win the treble , they won the Europa league, the cup and the league? And did Jose win the treble in 2003 as he did the same . No they each won three trophies\n\nA treble is consists of 2 national trophies (national league and main national cup) and one international trophy. If you consider it a treble or the treble is up to you.\n\nWell yes, of course. I‚Äôd also say that Leverkusen winning ‚Äúa‚Äù treble is definitely a bigger deal than City winning ‚Äúthe‚Äù treble. Leverkusen‚Äôs success is a true testament to the players‚Äô improvement and cohesion into an undefeated unit under Alonso‚Äôs genius direction. No FFP bullshit and a ¬£1B price tag. The project isn‚Äôt part of a manufactured oil baron PR campaign.\n\nLmao if you say so. No Europa treble is even entering my list but you keep telling yourself that lol\n\nNot even close. Europa League is literal garbage. \n\nLeverkusen winning the league is impressive. \n\nThe Europa League means nothing as always. \n\nThe German Cup didn‚Äôt even involve beating Bayern. Surely their cup run has to be the easiest in the history of the competition? They‚Äôre playing against second division teams.\n\nso if your club was put in the EL and won it you wouldn‚Äôt be happy at all?\n\nDepends on the club. Any top team that should be in CL, then the Europa League means nothing (Liverpool, United, Chelsea, Arsenal etc.). \n\nThe treble is the league, cup and CL. Leverkusen are just having a good season.\n\nPretty much. United winning the EL was pretty meh. Sort of like finishing first in the championship lol.\n\nOur run in the EFL cup was easier\n\nEFL cup is even more dog shit. Teams don‚Äôt even play full strength. It‚Äôs just City, Liverpool, United, Chelseas yearly ‚Äúwe won a trophy‚Äù.\n\nYou don't get to gatekeep what a \"treble\" is. If you win three trophies, it's a treble.\n\nExactly let Leverkusen have a seat the TABLE!\n\nIt‚Äôs not a treble but that doesn‚Äôt change the fact what their doing is amazing"

How very dare he be upset about people from his home town be massacred by British soldiers. Fucking monster.\n\n[deleted]\n\n[deleted]\n\nI don‚Äôt think he said he hates England - he has repeatedly said that he respect anyone that chooses to wear the poppy.\n\nGet a fucking grip\n\nThought they made their living in Whales?\n\nNah despite being quite large whales throats are only small so therefore they could only get into the mouth so the entirety of Wrexham couldn't make their living in a whale.\n\nPerhaps they should move to San Diego for a bigger fit.\n\nWhich of course in German means a whales vagina\n\nYeah, that was the silent part of the joke.\n\nWas being the key word‚Ä¶\n\n[deleted]\n\nthey've got muslamic ray guns you know\n\nWell I‚Äôm such a stupid prick whose mother hates him for screwing that spelling up.\n\n\nOh btw British isn‚Äôt a country‚Ä¶\n\nWhat? Britain is very much a country\n\nThe animal?¬†\n\nJonah, she is your mother and you will show her respect.\n\nPeople are too emotionally charged about things that don't affect their lives in any way.\n\nI was in the Army for 7 years, I take part in remembrance, I support our armed forces. Does it affect a single iota of my life what some football player thinks about it? Couldn't give a fuck what he thinks. I have my reasons, he has his.\n\nHe doesn't want to wear a poppy, oh boo fucking hoo, how will I sleep at night.\n\nThe community he comes from will all think the same, there is no way he is wearing a poppy just to appease fans he doesn‚Äôt even know when he wouldn‚Äôt be able to step back in his own community if he did. \nYou are absolutely spot on, we all have our views on things and he is doing nothing wrong by having his, it‚Äôs just some people have to get riled up about absolutely anything and everything, I‚Äôm sure some people spend their days looking for things to be pissed off about. ..\n\nIf you‚Äôre pissed off, the only persons day you‚Äôre ruining is your own, but people are too thick to see that.\n\nThe problem is some people are just miserable humans. They don‚Äôt want to find happiness in their own lives. And it compounds itself with the fact that misery loves company.\n\nAnd most of the snowflakes crying and getting offended and outraged on your behalf? Yeah they‚Äôve never served in the armed forces and probably donate the absolute bare minimum possible when they buy a poppy (if they even do)\n\nLike Rangers fans with their over the top pagentry and then forget to hand over the money\n\nI wish more people had your view on it. I mean, I don't see why people care if people wear it or not.\n\nIt‚Äôs usually the same crowd that start screaming ‚Äòsnowflakes‚Äô and ‚Äòcan‚Äôt say anything without someone being offended‚Äô when something pro-LGBT or similar comes up, that are the ones offended over minor things like a poppy.\n\nSo the people with too much time on their hands pretty much.\n\nThe end\n\nNemanja Matic as well, and I'm sure quite a few players have an issue with it but don't want to be hounded so wear it.\n\n[deleted]\n\nBut he isn‚Äôt British he‚Äôs Irish\n\nOh boy. Here we go.\n\nIt's literally at the core of the GFA that anyone born in NI can be considered Irish, British or both if they do choose. I think James McClean has made his choice very clear.\n\nAgreed. \n\nStill doesn't mean people won't get their knickers in a twist over it.\n\nAnd those people are fucking idiots not worthy of anyone's time.\n\nThat goes both ways BTW.\n\nI don't care if they wear it or not myself. I can't remember if Matic was hounded for not wearing one or not, as that was quite a while ago.\n\nHe was not, probably because his reasoning for wearing it was a more anti-war stance as opposed to McClean's very understandable anti-British army stance\n\nMatic reason is the same as McLeans‚Ä¶ matic wont wear it because of the British participation in the Bosnian/Kosovo war which saw us bomb Yugoslavia.\n\nDidn't know that, mea culpa!\n\nYeah, my cousin was actually adopted from the Kosovo war as my uncle was in Kosovo as a peacekeeper and adopted him after his parents were killed.\n\nBased uncle\n\nAt the end of the day people should wear it if they want too and if people don't want to wear it that's fine as they have legitimate reasons not too. I will say people on both sides shouldn't be hounding people over wearing/not wearing a poppy as what's the point of doing that?.\n\nMatic didn't wear one. Didn't say why (I think anyway) but it's most likely due to the NATO bombing in 99 (so similar reason) \n\nEdit, he did say why. It was this reason.\n\nCallum Wilson didn't wear one although idk the reason\n\nKillian Phillips also didn't wear one as well as choosing not to stand with his team mates for the exact reason as James McClean (What happened in Derry) as his family is from there (he was born in US but plays for Rep of Ireland)\n\nFor a lot of us in the Caribbean community it‚Äôs really complicated‚Ä¶ many players are from that community‚Ä¶ but want to protect family and teammmates and family\n\nIrish Catholic from NI, so abuse and coverage seems to be permitted. Like Christmas it comes around every year.\n\n[deleted]\n\nThat's brilliant tho\n\nHe‚Äôs showing support for the people who fought for his country.\n\nSounds kinda similar to that poppy thing right?\n\nI have never wore a poppy in my life but when you dress up in terrorist uniform with your son, you are a scumbag and shouldnt be in that country. \n\nThere is nothing special about this guy. He is no different than the common online troll, who exploits nationalism to get a reaction. That is it. He probably goes back to Ireland and gets pats on the back by men in their 20s screaming \"up the IRA\". That is why he does it.\n\nThis is an absolutely fucking bonkers take. He doesn‚Äôt wear it because of Bloody Sunday where British soldiers murdered 26 catholic people in Derry, which is his home city. The poppy used to represent fallen soldiers of WW1 and WW2 but now represents all British soldiers who died in active service which would include the soldiers who murdered these 26 people. That‚Äôs why he doesn‚Äôt wear the poppy.\n\n&gt; He doesn‚Äôt wear it because of Bloody Sunday where British soldiers murdered 26 catholic people in Derry, which is his home city. \n\nThey killed 14 people, not 26.\n\nYep sorry you‚Äôre right, shot at 26 and killed 14\n\nRight, but this guy is pointing out McLean doesn't just not wear the poppy, he thinks it's funny to post pictures on the Internet of him teaching his kid to be a terrorist and murder other civilians, like the IRA did where I grew up not long ago.\n\nImagine the reaction of his supporters if an English player made a similar joke about recruiting for the Black and Tans or UVF.\n\nOr the British army, who engaged in terrorist acts in NI and the country of Ireland? Who the poppy supports?\n\nDifference between an armed forces and a terrorist group.\n\nThe US army has committed atrocities all over the world. You can't go cheering 9/11 with your kids.\n\nWould it not also include the thousands of Irish soldiers (from the south who still fought in WWI and WWII) who also died in WWI and WWII? I don't think anyone should be forced to wear a poppy if they don't want to, but it signifies more then just remembering BRITISH soldiers.\n\nWe have our own remembrance services in Ireland. It would be weird to take part in another country's services, especially when the other country is also including soldiers that murdered people here\n\n&gt;but it signifies more then just remembering BRITISH soldiers.\n\nBy fighting in the British army during WW2 they would be counted as British Soldiers \n\nIn WW1 they would literally be British Soldiers as Ireland was still occupied \n\n\n\n&gt;but it signifies more then just remembering BRITISH soldiers.\n\nNo it doesn't\n\nRemind me what country the guy who wrote the poem In Flanders Fields came from again? Sorry but Britain most certainly DOES NOT own a monopoly on the poppy only representing British soldiers.  That's just a completely ignorant statement to make especially when you consider the symbol of the poppy was first adopted by a women living in AMERICA.\n\n&gt;the guy\n\nAn American woman \n\n&gt;Sorry but Britain most certainly DOES NOT own a monopoly on the poppy only representing British soldiers.\n\nThe original version of the Poppy is primarily used in Great Britain and Commonwealth countries so yeah it would be fairly close to a monopoly.\n\nWhat terrorist  uniform? A balaclava? A fucking ski mask?\nFucking hell the Nordics  must be huge terrorist so with all their skiing so\n\nNuance.\n\nDo yourself a favour and read up on the troubles in NI. I think you'll empathise with his position a lot more.\n\nThe tedious cunts who drag this argument up every year won't be happy till they've hounded this lad out of the game or worse. Every single year he has to repeat his (entirely justifiable) position.\n\nI mean he‚Äôs 35\n\nHe made his bed when he posted terrorist dress up pictures on social media. \n\nReiterating his position every singly November is exactly the position he wants to be in. \n\nHe could have just not worn the poppy and got on with it.\n\nIt's funny how people like you have outrage over the balaclava post but are silent on the abhorrent abuse both McClean and his family get over not wearing a poppy. If he didn't explain his position, guarantee people like you would be calling him a coward, etc. The man is taking a stand for something he truly believes in. Do you honestly think he's going to do it for attention if it means his family will be continually threatened?\n\nNot a peep out of them either about Declan Rice posting up the ra on his twitter. Very clearly prejudiced\n\nWhat if I told you he legitimately believes what the british army did to his community was an act of terrorism\n\nAgain, if terrorist acts, and innocent murders bother him so much, why share social media posts indicating a support for the IRA?\n\nThey have plenty of blood on their hands.\n\nNot only murdered the civil rights marchers,most shot in the back . They planted weapons on bodies and put all the blame on the victims. Then the Widgery Inquest exonerated the scumbags who did it . Still no justice all these years later. Still huge flags and banners flown in support of Soldier F and the parachute regiment. Good on you James for your tiny little gesture that causes so many heads to boil.\n\nIsn't the whole point of the good Friday agreement to essentially say \"fucking stop it, it's a draw, forget the past, in 30 or 40 years time when the demographics change we can have a talk on a different path on Northern Ireland\"? \n\nOtherwise \"the scumbags\" would surely have to involve those who blew up children in Birmingham who were never brought to justice, those snipers that popped British soldiers, the ones that blew up prison officers outside their homes etc. \n\nIt was a grim part of British and Irish history. Dont pretend one side smelled of roses.\n\nIf the British weren‚Äôt in Ireland in the first place horrible events like the Birmingham incident wouldn‚Äôt have happened\n\nThey weren't...they were in Northern Ireland...that is the whole point... the good Friday agreement was what I described in my original post.\n\nThe scale of awful things that each side did to the other are not even remotely comparable.\n\nI know right, only one side blew up children in the troubles, with car bombs and stuff! But, i forgive the RA and so do most of northern ireland, I'm coming at from the side of every one was culpable and it should be a square draw and let everyone live in peace from now on.\n\nOld, but more relevant than ever considering the performative patriotism of some - David Squires' cartoons on the annual poppygate BS [2014](https://www.theguardian.com/football/cartoon/2014/nov/13/david-squires-footballers-wearing-poppies), [2016](https://www.theguardian.com/football/picture/2016/nov/08/david-squires-football-poppy-fury-season),  [2017](https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2017/nov/07/david-squires-on-football-and-poppygate-2017), [2019](https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2019/nov/12/david-squires-on-football-and-the-poppy)\n\nAbsolutely hilarious McClean is mentioned in the 2016 one and here we are basically a decade later and he's still the one in the headlines lol\n\nQuality thanks for sharing these\n\nObviously leaked on purpose to make the episode of welcome to Wrexham more dramatic.\n\nNot exactly a rule just for him though? \n\nReferees have always had the freedom to tell players to just head straight towards the tunnel when being subbed, rather than their closest pitchside exit, if the referee deems it necessary \neg prevent players from walking in front of away fans.  \n\nWatch any game over the weekend and most players will avoid going off at the closest side so they can waste some time with no punishment from the ref.\n\nPeople are insane\n\nThe people that get upset by it are the ones calling everyone else \"woke snowflakes\".  \nIt's hilarious.\n\nI‚Äôm a staunch Rangers fan and unionist and I couldn‚Äôt care less about him not wearing a poppy, it‚Äôs completely his choice.\n\nWhilst I don‚Äôt agree with him. I do believe in free speech. The Irish received horrific abuse from WW1 veterans PTSD. I can‚Äôt blame them for having such views. I know poppies are not about supporting wars or the armed forces. Has anyone seen the hands in the pockets thing by the Irish when meeting the royal family?\n\nDogmatic poppy shaggers are an absolute blight.\n\nOh man do they actually have sex with the poppies? This explains a lot no wonder the guy doesn‚Äôt want to be involved.\n\nYeah, fuck those 60 year old women trying to remember their dead fathers, uncles, brothers etc.\n\nThey‚Äôre welcome to remember and honour their loved ones however they wish.\n\nThey‚Äôre not allowed to scream and finger point at those who‚Äôd rather not wear a poppy or be involved in Remembrance Day. \n\nIt‚Äôs really not complicated mate.\n\nWell yes they are actually because that‚Äôs part of being in a free country. Just like mclean is allowed to not wear the poppy and give his reasons, fans are allowed to call him a wanker if they wish. It swings both ways. \n\nDeaths threats etc are obviously too far though. If fans wanna boo and jeer him however though they‚Äôre more than welcome.\n\nIf they‚Äôre going at other people for their own choice not to wear them‚Ä¶ then yeah. No one is asking anyone to not wear a poppy, just to not be an utter arse to those who would prefer not to.\n\nHow do you figure someone who‚Äôs 60 years old in 2024 managed to lose a father in a war 20 years before they were born?\n\nDo you think I‚Äôm talking about a specific war?\n\nIt‚Äôs called generalising.\n\nI mean, I assumed you‚Äôre referencing WW1 and WW2 which is actually relevant to Remembrance Day but your comment suggests you don‚Äôt think too hard about these things.\n\nYou think it‚Äôs the 60 year old women watching Wrexham United games?\n\n[removed]\n\nRife. Bollocks.\n\nBehave lol no it isn‚Äôt. Hasn‚Äôt been rife in England since my grandad was cutting his teeth over here.\n\nThat chip on the shoulder still there, huh?\n\nNot at all but thanks for helping prove my point\n\nWelcome mate. Obviously helps that I'm fucking Irish. Tit.\n\nHow do you know I‚Äôm not? Your experience of living in England may have been completely different to mine living in Scotland. I wouldn‚Äôt say that disproves or proves either of our points though. Hate crimes commited towards catholics in Scotland on the other hand‚Ä¶\n\nI don't give a fuck if you're Irish, British, Japanese or Zimbabwean. You called me out saying that I'm proving your point when it's blatantly obvious I wasn't. I'm saying you've got a chip on your shoulder, which I stand behind and nor did you challenge. \n\nWho mentioned Scotland? Not me, you're referring to a different post. You specifically said \"Britain\" though. So which is it? Or are you back tracking. \n\nOur experiences clearly are different. I've never felt any animosity. Not saying that's the case for you so we'll leave it at that... You've still got a chip on your shoulder though.\n\nI don‚Äôt really have a chip on my shoulder and in terms of back tracking I would take back the word rife on reflection. A better choice of words would be there is a pervasive sense of acceptable discrimination in Britain and the Irish and Irish catholics make up a large portion of this. I think the reaction of the post seems to be around the word rife when, in my view at least, it should be about the racism. I genuinely don‚Äôt have a chip on my shoulder but it does make me angry that I can be called a fenian bastard and have to laugh it off as workplace banter. Have you had any similar experiences in England?\n\nAll this sort of thing is on the rise it's being agitated by social media and grifters, it's really sad that technology is being used to take society backwards in terms of tolerance\n\nAye it‚Äôs probably being agitated by bots as well. Online discourse is a crash course in purveying the most extreme and offensive views like they‚Äôre normal.\n\nIf an Englishmen went to Ireland and did a similar thing to they would get exactly the same reaction.\n\nIt‚Äôs a very nuanced issue. I don‚Äôt care about Maclean really, he can wear a poppy or not. Not too fussed.\n\nBut when Celtic fans sing and make noise through a minutes silence that‚Äôs a step too far and disrespectful.\n\nWhat similar thing would that be? What would an Englishman be pressured to doing that would pay deference to an organisation which targeted his friends and family?\n\nAnything to do with the Easter uprising or the IRA? Plenty of marches in favour of them dispute them basically killing Englishmen and other Irish people.\n\nNeither of them are really celebrated in Ireland.\n\nIf there was though and an Englishmen said he didn‚Äôt want to respect it the same would happen.\n\nSadly there are pro IRA marches in Glasgow and Belfast pretty regularly. I don‚Äôt like them but  they happen without incident.\n\nGo away with this nonsense. \n\nIt doesn't happen the closest we had was for 100 year anniversary and even then it was mild \"celebration\" and no Englishman was forced to respect it. \n\nThere is no pro IRA marches in Belfast.\n\nI'm from West Belfast, from a republican background and I can tell you there are numerous pro-IRA marches in Belfast. Like, fucking loads. Still plenty of flute and accordion bands. There are three every Easter Sunday alone, one for the Provisionals (mainstream republicanism), one for the INLA/IRSP (\"socialist\" republicans) and one for the dissidents (NEW IRA, Oglaigh na h√âireann, etc.) loads of wee ones to various memorial gardens on different days, still have Guards of Honour at funerals, the full she-bang. still happen in Derry, Newry, Strabane, various other places.\n\nNone of those have any offical support from the authorities so trying to compare them to Rememberance Subday is idiotic.\n\nBut you said they don‚Äôt even happen‚Ä¶ Make up your mind.\n\nThere are very much pro IRA marches in Glasgow. Just cause you don‚Äôt like it doesn‚Äôt make it not true.\n\nUsed to live on the walking route and saw many of them and many orange marches. Most people don‚Äôt know the difference\n\n&gt;There are very much pro IRA marches in Glasgow. \n\nNever said there wasn't BTW are these offically sanctioned by the authorities. \n\n&gt;Just cause you don‚Äôt like it doesn‚Äôt make it not true.\n\nIf you can just make up a hypothetical situation I can declare anything I say to be the truth.\n\nSo there are pro IRA marches but I also made them up?\n\nDid you just create a double made up scenario to try and prove a point?\n\nThe word ‚Äúif‚Äù does a lot of heavy lifting in the comment.\n\nWhich is a complete false equivalence to the pressure public figures about wearing a poppy. It‚Äôs a game of football it has fuck all to do with politics. Nobody is marching sports people to 1916 or IRA marches.\n\nThe poppy isn‚Äôt about politics. This has been said a million times. \n\nThe only people who want it to be about politics are the people who want to disrespect it.\n\nWear it or don‚Äôt wear it but don‚Äôt disturb a million‚Äôs silence that means a lot to people.\n\nYou can say that all you want but for many it absolutely is a political statement. Maclean doesn‚Äôt disturb silences he chooses not to wear it and provides his rationale and for return he and his family has been hounded.\n\nI said I don‚Äôt care about McLean and understand his reasoning although don‚Äôt agree with him.\n\nI care about people disturbing other people paying their respects. Thats out of order\n\nOkay completely irrelevant to what‚Äôs being discussed though.\n\nNo it‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs about the morals of the Celtic fans and the club and what they are willing to put up with and stand behind.\n\nCeltic are a rotten club and the fans just accept it.\n\nI might have missed something. But has he been disturbing others marking respect?¬†\n\nNah he‚Äôs just using this as a vehicle for his own bigotry which is shrouded in concern about the republican element of the Celtic support. He‚Äôs doing a great job in proving what my point was though.\n\nNo I said I didn‚Äôt care about McLean but I personally thought what the Celtics fans did was disrespectful and shouldn‚Äôt be accepted.\n\nThe 1916 Easter *Rising perpetrated by the 1919-founded IRA?\n\nYou missed the word ‚Äòor‚Äô\n\nI love when we ruin a minutes silence or applause.\n\nHere‚Äôs my favourite.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/8ZRiL2_lrdQ?si=eqcuAGvtR5_QrguP\n\nCeltic fans are basically the worse fans in the UK. Not sure you can complain about how James McLean gets treated when your fans are doing this.\n\nAnd you never sing songs pressuring the board to pay compensation to all the young boys who were abused by the Celtic Boys Club. These were Celtic fans abused by Celtic officials wearing the Celtic kit. Amazing silent when it comes to something they could actually do something about.\n\nScandal after scandal in the Catholic Church sadly and you‚Äôve also got Celtic supporting terrorists regularly. \n\nOnly thing I can support them on is their anti royal family stance and antizion agenda\n\nWho is the terrorists ? The British army or the IRA ?\n\nEasiest way to find out who the terrorists are is to see which ones the Celtic fans support.\n\nWell I‚Äôm a Celtic fan born and bred in Dublin and I don‚Äôt support terrorists .\n\nI‚Äôm Irish but raised in England. It‚Äôs not full of anti Irish hate here. Scotland is the real melting pot with rangers and Celtic both extremists.\n\nSo who are the terrorists? \nI‚Äôm sure as an Irish man you see the British army as terrorists to Irish people so who then are the terrorists you speak of ?\n\nYou don‚Äôt have a clue what you‚Äôre talking about.\n\nFound the ~~victim~~ celtic fan\n\nNah it‚Äôd be champion instead of victim\n\nLike clockwork\n\nDiddums\n\nOh don‚Äôt be a tit. Racism my arse. You‚Äôd go to A&amp;E over a pinprick with this sort of melodrama.\n\nAnd you‚Äôre a right twat for using Fascism in the same sentence as the poppy. If I recall correctly, and I do, the people the poppy represents are the reason they aren‚Äôt ruling Europe right now and the Irish nationalists weren‚Äôt exactly the staunch opposition there.\n\nBro says don't be a tit, then proceeds to be a massive tit. Scenes.\n\nYou recall incorrectly it‚Äôs not been that for over 20 years.\n\nI think you should probably read a few history books, but we both know you‚Äôre not looking to understand why anyone would disagree with you\n\nI have. Where were the Irish in World War Two? If you want to throw around things like Fascism and racism, you can‚Äôt be taking the side that did nothing to fight against it purely because of their Anti British sentiment, and that‚Äôs only if we give the most generous view of it.\n\nDo you get there‚Äôs history other than WW2?\n\nDo you actually understand why Ireland didn‚Äôt join?\n\nWhy the fuck am I wasting time on you\n\nYeah, fortunately though, thanks to the people the poppy represents, not much other fascist history. So if you‚Äôre going to be throwing fascist around, you can‚Äôt be doing that while directly aligning against the people who actually fought fascists.\n\nAnd yeah, I get why they didn‚Äôt join, because they were more focused on their hatred of Britain than actually doing the right thing. Again, which is why racism and fascism are completely and totally inappropriate to use here.\n\nAnd as far as I‚Äôm concerned, you‚Äôre not actually bothering at all. All you‚Äôve offered is righteous indignation while completely avoiding the points made. But you can continue pretending to hold the moral high ground and offer nothing else of value if you want.\n\nDo you understand that you‚Äôre replying to a completely different commenter (I‚Äôve not mentioned facism).\n\nAll of your comments really just shout that you should read more, I‚Äôm sorry dude, but the fact you can‚Äôt even work out who you‚Äôre replying to should tell you that, if your selective takes on recent history somehow didn‚Äôt already\n\nI‚Äôve been aware. You can‚Äôt just jump into a conversation and completely redirect away from the point of it. That‚Äôs not a lack of awareness from me, that‚Äôs just a complete lack of communication skills from you. The balls to throw that on me are immense.\n\n[removed]\n\nYou‚Äôre just on a ramble at this point mate, I can‚Äôt even get a clear point from that. I think we‚Äôre done here\n\n[removed]\n\nExcept as you said, the Irishmen who served did so under the same umbrella with the poppy as they were in the British Army, so even with that being the case, it‚Äôs still on a side that is distinctly not against the fascists.\n\nYou say all this like the British or the French or whoever had everything in the world to offer when the fall of both empires was directly down to the war and massive losses were made, to do the right thing. Whether you have excuses and this or that or not, Ireland didn‚Äôt do the right thing as a country. You can‚Äôt throw around fascist while being on that side of the argument that didn‚Äôt side against the fascists.\n\n[removed]\n\nYou‚Äôre gonna take the guy who was thrown off the thrown and disowned by the entire country while everyone else fought to do the right thing at the cost of the country and lives to show that Britain were actually somehow with the fascists here, while trying to justify how it‚Äôs fine that your personal interests aligned you with the Nazis over the Allies so you were OK staying neutral?\n\nI think you‚Äôve just shown exactly why this is a problem. Like Ireland at the time, you‚Äôre too blinded by hating the British.\n\nAny examples?\n\nThe fucking article.\n\nThe article, or the abuse JM has faced, isn‚Äôt an example of rife racism against Irish people in Britain. Aligning the two ignores any context. \n\nJM has been incredibly vocal about his disdain for some of the key institutional/cultural foundations of the UK - the king and remembrance Sunday are two examples. He was also very critical at the Euros about England fans arrogance. \n\nIt‚Äôs not hard, even if I disagree with it, to understand why he‚Äôs then received abuse for taking that stance. He‚Äôs more than welcome (and justified) in taking those stances but it‚Äôs also not supprising that, when living in the UK and being paid in the pound, that he‚Äôd receive criticism and abuse for it. \n\nFrom what I‚Äôve seen, most the abuse stems from his very public opinions and stance rather than his race.\n\nAny other examples since it's so fucking rife?\n\n33% of hate crimes committed in Scotland were against catholics, mainly of Irish descent despite them only making up 13% of the country. Something tells me you‚Äôve made your mind up though.\n\nI know you‚Äôre trying to be cute, but every year around this time the rags in England start the ‚Äúempire‚Äù bullshit about this issue and any person that dates not support the poppy gets attacked. \n\nIt‚Äôs honestly silly that a league with a vast majority of the players not being from the UK gives a shit about this anyways. The only English thing left in that league is the team names.\n\nYes, every year this happens and every year, we hear the reason why McClean wontt wear a Poppy. I'm asking a genuine question as I never hear of any other incidents\n\nIt‚Äôs not rife. They‚Äôre just being dramatic and angry to feel they‚Äôre making a point\n\nfreedom of expression is a two way street.\n\nXxx\n\nFuck England. Fuck Queen Lizzy.\n\n[deleted]\n\nOr are you playing both sides so you always come out on top?\n\n[deleted]\n\nIt's a quote from Rob's character in Its Always Sunny. \n\nHating 2 people, who don‚Äôt remotely seem to be bad people, with a passion seems quite unhealthy. Hope you're able to work that out, bud.\n\nI don‚Äôt know Ryan Reynolds but he did scab during the writers strike in 2023, have his wedding at a plantation, and is fueling a blacklisting effort for the guy who directed his wife‚Äôs last movie. I agree that hating someone you don‚Äôt know ‚Äúwith a passion‚Äù is a bit odd, but saying this dude doesn‚Äôt seem even remotely like a bad person seems a little disingenuous.\n\nI think you'll find its a popular  opinion \nPeople hate Wrexham\nHas thay plastic feel to it, a man city or Salford kinda vibe\n\nIt's not unpopular in Chester.\n\nSubjugation is a thing...hard to break the cycle of hate.\n\nHe's every right to his opinion even if I think its a disgusting pov. Likewise, fans have every right to let him know how we feel about him\n\nWhat's disgusting about it?\n\nImagine not supporting the people who shot 30 of your neighbours in the back. Cant understand it.\n\nHe also posed as an IRA terrorist who, as I recall, killed hundreds of innocent civilian neighbours of his. \n\nHe doesn‚Äôt just ‚Äònot wear the poppy‚Äô he is a terrorist sympathiser.\n\nAnd everyone who wears a poppy is a terrorist sympathiser. Was it an act of terror to shoot 12 innocent people dead on the streets of Derry during a civil rights March?\n\nIt's disgusting and I think thousands of us are justified to turn up at his work to abuse him, I mean express our valid opinion on his abborhent political beliefs, even though he's paid to play football.\n\n/s\n\nWhat the fuck is wrong with you? How can you think not wearing a poppy is disgusting, especially with the context as to why he doesn‚Äôt wear it. Get a grip, Jesus Christ."

    "all_comment_text": "Did Lewa and Bayern issue a statement about the 20/21 ballon d‚Äôor?\n\nPeople just need to accept the simple fact that the best player of the year will never be objectively measured. It will always be subjective, it's not mathematics\n\nFurthermore, it's kinda silly to attempt to make an objective selection when most, if not all, stats are dominated by offensive work. Cannavaro could never win it nowadays.\n\nExactly. It's why I'm actually surprised Rodri won it. The fact he did means that Everyone is finally willing to look past just stats.\n\nWell, not everyone. The meltdown from plastic Madrid fans has been epic.\n\nOoh, as much as I hate Man City, the fact that Rodri has triggered an entire club and its fanbase is the schadenfreude I live for. \n\nThey'll never admit it, but Rodri is a worthy winner of the Ballon d'Or.  Guy was an engine for Man City and Spain. With consistently good to great performances. Honestly, the FA Cup final against Utd is the only bad game I can remember.\n\nI love it. As much as I can't stand City, I would have Rodri win it every season for the rest of his career if it meant I get to see meltdown repeat over and over. \n\nThe Ballon d'Or means next to nothing to people outside of Madrid or Barca, and that makes this meltdown even funnier.\n\nOnly way to Madrid had to beat Messi for Ballon d'Or was to win the UCL. I think that somehow made (a lot of) people believe that if you win the UCL you are _entitled_ this individual trophy too. Which is silly. But the uproar is their fault for not giving the trophy to the best player every time (not saying it had to be Messi) but to the biggest star of the team that wins UCL.\n\nThen by that definition should a City player not have won it last year?\n\nHe could‚Äôve. But Messi winning the World Cup in that years Ballon d‚Äôor cycle meant he was going to get it. He was too big with too great a career to not have gotten it\n\nYou are giving them too much credit. They are candle wax at most, don‚Äôt require too much heat to melt. Usually they‚Äôre just butter.\n\nNot attending football matches make people into stat merchants, and that's exactly what 99% of these plastics are. In fact, I don't know why half of them are upset when their second team is Man City\n\n74 unbeaten games for club and 1 euro win with an unbeaten run is kinda good stats. His g/a is also quite good for a defensive player.¬†\n\nWhy people are having a meltdown is quite odd.¬†\n\nMadrid didn't get their way for once in many years, which is causing people to have a meltdown. And it's glorious.\n\nYeah Rodri winning is actually an interesting result. It's an eye test choice, rather than a stats one. Rodri is so important, and it's hard to demonstrate that through statistics. \n\nVini Jr was my initial pick for it but I think this option is better.\n\nIt‚Äôs not that hard to demonstrate with statistics, statisticians measure performance above expected and above replacement, and Rodri‚Äôs stats there are absolutely phenomenal.\n\nCity‚Äôs results with him in the team improve an absolutely ridiculous amount versus with any replacement, well beyond what any confounding factors can account for.\n\nIf Rodri turned in one season like this as an attacker he‚Äôd win it. It‚Äôs taken consecutive seasons of being a one of a kind player for club and country.\n\nNot just stats but just goals. Coming from other sports I don‚Äôt believe anyone pays attention to anything but goals. So yeah, I‚Äôm stoked Rodri won. He deserves it.\n\nIt‚Äôs a voting contest, you win by some criteria but it‚Äôs whatever.. and everyone has an opinion, Seedorf backing him up doesn‚Äôt really mean shit as other great players also been doing the same about Rodri as well as with other players. Just move on people, these are kids making millions of euros a month, which is what it‚Äôs all about at the end of their career nowadays.\n\nIts the Journo‚Äôs Choice Award\n\nThat and the award doesn‚Äôt actually matter. The club doesn‚Äôt get anything out of it except PR, which none of the top clubs are lacking. The player s are all already global superstars for the most part, especially the ones with a chance of winning. \n\nThe award takes into account three main criteria: \nIndividual ability and performance, team performance and sportsmanship. This means the best player can be overlooked for being a diving crybaby (which is probably why Vini didn‚Äôt win), and also for simply being at the wrong club (eg Van Dijk and Salah in 18 and 19 respectively as they only won 1 trophy each season). \n\nThe award is not actually designed for an objective  (or as objective as possible) assessment of who the best player is. It‚Äôs a marketing opportunity. If it weren‚Äôt, Blokhin and Weah would never have won it, for example.\n\nAnd it's not always the same top journalists every time....It always baffles me how people try to compare the 2023 award to 2010 for example.\n\nThey should have\n\nI think he made a comment about it, he was bit disapointed but cheesus christ nobody was crying over it like this\n\n19/20 you mean?\n\nHe absolutely would've won the 19/20 but probably deserved the 2021 version too, he scored nearly 50 goals in the 20/21 season and won the league and cup double. Messi scored 38 and Barca finished 3rd in the league, won the Copa Del Rey but got knocked out at the round of 16 in the UCL. He won the Copa America which is a plus point but I really think the argument should be made as the best PLAYER for Lewandowski for that second year too. \n\nI also never like a tournament win being used unless that player was by far and away the best player and kept saving them from being knocked out by themselves because only certain players from certain countries can win. He's not going to win playing for Poland because they're not good enough. Likewise in 22-23, Messi scored 21 goals and won Ligue 1 with PSG, no other trophies aside the one they win every year. Haaland scored over 50 goals and won the treble, but because Messi won the World Cup, that was basically the only criteria needed for voters to vote him best of the year. Which is mental. Again, least of which because Haaland can't ever win the World Cup because he plays for Norway so it seems like an unfair criteria to use in judging a player for a few weeks vs what someone else did across the whole year\n\nHe scored 69 goals for club and country in the 2021 calendar year\n\nWhy do people treat 2020 and 2021 like one thing? It's so weird. 2020 he got screwed, 2021 he lost a close race, totally different situation\n\nI love how dumb people are when they include 2021 Ballondor lol, like clearly Lewa wasn't as good on 21 thn he was in 20. Messi had a better overall record that year along with way better match ratings and way more MOTM n more G/A\n\nYeah but it's clown behavior when u have people like lewy or haaland lead their teams to a triplet and they get no recognition. I'm a barca fan but getting Messi win then is crazy\n\nSo Lewa won league title which Bayern had a 10x streak of and even then that was the best trophy lewa could show that year. \n\nMessi won Copa and Copa del rey, He was the MVP of the tournament in Copa, was the MVP in del rey final (and tournament). Copa/Euro holds more weight then even League titles like PL and Laliga and lewa won the title of 4th best league lol.\n\nAlso Messi had way more dribbles, Key passes, most MOTM by a long margin. \n\nIt's actually funny how you people try to descredit Messi in every turn of his life lol. It wasn't even close, as For Halland, \n\nMessi won the biggest Tournament of Football by being the Player of tournament and winning Golden ball along with having top assister and 1 goal behind top scorer. Was the player who was fouled the most, top dribbler, most key passes made.\n\nBig bro, key passess, more MOTM, more dribbles, don't matter for jackshit in the Ballon d or. I don't think ronaldo had any advantage in any of the stats you mentioned over messi when he won it 5 times. That season, lewandoski scored 41 goals in 29 league games, and 69 goals in the calender year ( matched ronaldos career best in 1 less game ). No one is discrediting messi, hes the greatest footballer ever, but that season, lewandoski just purely outscored him at a rate which made any other stat pointless.  \n\nI saw that Copa, it was a good achievement, not really comparable to the 41 goals in 29 games ( and 7 assists ) that lewandoski achieved. If you swapped lewys and messis stats, messi would win the Ballon d or even faster with even less of a debate. The world cup was still impressive as a feat, that Copa wasn't so much.  \n\nLewa won the title of the 4th best league lol. Lol. He won the Bundesliga, the fifa club world cup, the uefa super cup and the German super cup, all in that same span which was to be counted for the Ballon d or. His Bundesliga performance was more impressive than Messi's Copa del ray, or messis Copa America.  \n\nDuring that season he had 48 goals in 40 goals and 9 assists. That's 57 g/a in 40 games ( over 1.4 per game ), and 4 trophies won. Ge was also out injured when bayern drew psg 2-2 while having an xG of over 4, a game where he would've feasted, and still lost the popularity award to messi by the way.  \n\nHe has back to back fifa the best awards to show for those 2 seasons, and atleast they have a much more credible voter base than this stupid nonsense Ballon d or where even jorginho showed up in the top 3.\n\nYOU HAVE WON SECOND PRIZE IN A BEAUTY CONTEST COLLECT $10.\n\nReal have 3 players in the top 4 and another one in the top ten, yet they see clear evidence that they are not respected.\n\nCry me a river lol\n\nIt‚Äôs crazy entitlement! \n\nNeither Van Dijk or Salah were nominated at all but Liverpool haven‚Äôt thrown a tizzy. \n\nThere were no Juve/AC players, only two Leverkusen players and those clubs haven‚Äôt done any sort of publicity stunt. Only one Dortmund player too (absurd given team performance is a key criteria for the award and they were CL runners up). \n\nThe list was a shambles. But no, Real Madrid are the ones throwing their toys out of the pram - the most represented team in 8 of the last 10 ceremonies\n\n[deleted]\n\nManager of the year as well\n\nIt‚Äôs a bit much from them tbh üòÇ\n\nThey're acting like it's the steal of the century, which is fucking dumb because Rodri is an amazing player.\n\nRN fan but this shit a joke. Take the L, move on. Don't go but don't make drama all over¬†\n\nRoyal Navy?\n\nIs there a more arrogant club in any sport in any country in the world than Real Madrid?\n\nNo, the fans are insufferable, and so is the team.\n\nbit rude of you to consider children insufferableüòÇ\n\nI‚Äôd love it if none of the players that boycotted it were invited back until they issued a full and public apology and asked to be let back into consideration.\n\nLakers. Lakers fans are the worst.\n\nMan city are up there\n\nDid Man City have a meltdown when Messi won the Ballon D'or over Haaland?\n\nNo but the sued the FA over rules\n\nAfter the 115 charges got posted. Lmao.\n\nBallon d‚ÄôOr rules?\n\nThey may be down 115, but they‚Äôve just put one on the board. Is it too late to comeback and equalise?\n\nCan‚Äôt wait to see how bad you cry when city prevails over the bad faith charges.¬†\n\nAt least here in Spain, Bar√ßa is the same. Both team fans are fucking awful.\n\nThey need everything to be about them\n\nEdit: Exhibit A, both fanbases suck\n\nInsane levels of cringe. They say their player didn't win it so they are disrespected. Didn't Ronaldo win like half of thr ballon dors over the last twenty years\n\nThey should start their own league‚Ä¶ oh wait.\n\nIt‚Äôs sad how it‚Äôs devolved into this. They all used to be sportsmen, now they‚Äôre so spoiled and entitled\n\n[removed]\n\nEveryone is so damn soft‚Ä¶ the hardest footballers these days are probably women. The women‚Äôs game knows it can‚Äôt afford the perception.\n\nFr fr. You don‚Äôt see women flop at all even after the most vicious of tackles.\n\nFootball has always had ‚Äúfragile little snowflakes‚Äù in it. Getting into fights with your opponent in the tunnels doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre a ‚Äúman‚Äù, it just makes it look like you have small man syndrome. Players have always rolled around faking injuries and throwing tantrums and crying to the refs or the media\n\nTrue that is the only reason why im happy that rodri won\n\nNo wonder they don‚Äôt respect him. And your telling me this guy should be winning the Ballon dor? Really? When he is throwing a temper tantrum instead of being able to be humble and acknowledge the amazing achievements of a fellow player? Vini Jr has lost all of the respect I‚Äôve had for him and his abilities on the pitch.\n\nWhere the fuck is the class, in football? No other sport would tolerate this. It comes off so poorly.\n\nThis level of petuclence is unbecoming of a club of this stature. The fact that they wouldn't show up to acknowledge the winner because they feel slighted is already bad. But for some of these, Rodri is their countryman, their teammate. \n\nAbsolutely disgusting behavior from Madrid. You can all argue till you're blue in the face. You can downvote me for having a City flair.\n\nTheir behavior today is ABSOLUTELY CLASSLESS.\n\nComedy gold.\n\nSalty. We didn‚Äôt win so we are not going.\n\nThe thing is they did win. Not Vini, but Real was the best club and Ancelotti the best coach\n\n[removed]\n\nAlso a big difference to not go quietly than complain on every outlet imaginable\n\nThan you throw a party celebrating winning something you didn‚Äôt even‚Ä¶\n\nMessi is a single person and Madrid is a club. They HAVE to explain why the whole club is boycotting. The idea is the same though.\n\nI don't think Messi released a statement that he is not coming because he didn't win. Neither did Lewy and Bayern in 2020. No wonder Vini acts like diva, when the whole club is the same.\n\nCan you link to the official statement, because there‚Äôs nothing on Real Madrid website\n\nWhen did anyone mention Messi? So because Messi did something once it means Real Madrid can do it and nobody should care?\n\nMessi still haunts them to this day so they have to mention him every now and then\n\nSalty.\n\nI literally said to my friend in the morning that twitters gonna have a meltdown after Rodri wins, like clockwork...\n\nWho was your choice?\n\nRodri, I haven't really had a doubt since the Euros tbh. So much copium and gymnastics tonight to explain Vini not winning, it's something else lol\n\nI‚Äôm a big fan of him too, city‚Äôs results suffer when he doesn‚Äôt play.\n\nReal Madrid are absolute childish bad losers.\n\nTotally fine. They did not show up this weekend either\n\nClassless by the club. Let the players do their thing\n\nThey're making a habit of not showing up\n\nI hope they also make their protest felt this weekend by not showing up to play their match in the league üòÅ\n\nBoycott your back line\n\nUtterly utterly shameful and a total embarrassment to football.   \nI‚Äôve been becoming more and more disenfranchised with football and it‚Äôs things like this that just fill me with such a profound disgust.\n\n  \nthe absolute entitlement of these people. ashamed of Bellingham particularly as an Englishman. For all the supposed ‚Äúvalues‚Äù he tries to promote, it seems he really is as bad as the rumours say he is.\n\n  \nawful day for football\n\nI hoped the first post Messi/Cronaldo Ballon D'Or to be a spirited, unpredictable competition between the best players in the world, instead it's gonna be Real Madrid whining and embarrassing themselves if one of their players doesn't win every single year.\n\nTake the L, you giant babies.\n\nMan, there's no criteria. People just vote. But I wouldn't be surprised Franco's team doesn't understand the concept of democracy.\n\nThis is top tier jerking\n\nLost all respect for Real Madrid here. Very weak mentality to not show up.\n\nSuch an embarrassing action it makes me like Man City ü§Æ\n\nPapa Perez and his tiny little kids have a habit of getting their way by unfair decisions all the time, especially in La Liga. They are now upset that they didn't have their way.\n\nReal Madrid boycotting, their players posting on social media, and then the club issuing a statement looks like it's a bunch of kids playing high-school basketball. Utterly sore losers. \n\nVini acting like he did a 2012 Messi is so funny.\n\nSoo many things wrong with this sport tbh like ballon dor itself is a dodgy organisation they openly proved that from 2020 for all to see and Madrid are just a wrongen club who openly show that soo many times too\n\nbunch of sore losers\n\nWell I thought that RM suffered the biggest humiliation for a decade at the weekend but it appears they wished to trump that themselves.\n\nLewandowski didn't bitch about getting robbed of 2 ballon dors. One didn't happen because of COVID and the other was given to washed PSG Messi, no one fucking cared but when crybaby vinicius doesn't win suddenly we have to boycott the award?\n\nWashed PSG Messi who was the only player in Europe with 20+ goals and 20+ assists and won the world cup as the best player. Lmao\n\nIf lewa or vini did that they'd be crying deserves ballon d'or lol\n\nIn fact Vinicius didn't crack 20 assists last season either, and let's not even begin to compare his work in Copa America compared to Messi at the last World Cup\n\nThat's called \"not having class\"\n\nSuch a good week we are living\n\nBallon D‚Äô BOBo\n\nLol the crying ‚Ä¶. Spanish team not even showing a bit of enthusiasm that a fellow Spaniard won it in like years \n\nKeep classy Madrid\n\nI don't understand why the players announce before the award, I would have liked to see Vinicius cry üòÇüò≠\n\nHe cries every game he plays.....maybe switch sports and become a diver next Olympics...\n\nInternational play is part of it. \n\nVini's Brazil was bad in the Copa America.\nRodri's team won the Euros.\n\nRodri did not lose a match this year for club or country (including a technicality).\n\n&gt; rodri did not lose a match \n\n\nLmfao\n\nMadrid are the biggest pussies in sports\n\nIf its not Real we boycott...\nSuch class..\n\nReal Madrid is doubling down on harbouring the most unsportsmanlike players and employees under the sun üíÄ\n\nFrankly it's a tossup between Vinicious and Rodri. Either would've been fine as it was so close.\n\nHowever one can make a point that Rodri was and is the best player in his position. He's also more critical to his club than Vini is for his club. Madrid already has MBappe who according to many is a better player in the same position.\n\nBunch of cry babies, just like Vini, they really are made for each other\n\nA multi-billion EUR company behaving like a spoiled brat. Classy.\n\nIt would show class to congratulate the winner, but no. Lets cry like an entitled baby.\n\nShow no respect to the actual winner and claim to be disrespected, embarrassing!\n\nThey are one step away from ringing up trump to get advice on election interference...\n\nBunch of bitches at Real Madrid\n\nI have no issue with people thinking Vini deserves to win it.\n\nBut Rodri also deserved to win it.\n\nDisrespectful to act like you‚Äôre a cut above everyone else.\n\nOne of the most pathetic things I've ever seen in football, and that's a high bar to clear. The fragility of one of the game's greatest institutions, honestly. What a bunch of babies.\n\nNot a good look, RM.\n\nlol. When will they issue a statement congratulating Ancelotti?\n\nThey are acting the way everyone says we Argentinians act. We don't. \n\nImagine if an Argentinian said this lol\n\n&gt;we don‚Äôt \n\nYou‚Äôre right, Argentinians act worse than this.\n\nReal is acting childish. It was not the decision by one organization but by many journalists to give the award to Rodri who deserves it. Real could have shown its true champion mentality by congratulating him instead of playing this shitshow. It is really embarrassing.\n\nThey should discontinue the ballon d‚Äôor. It‚Äôs a PR contest anyways. I literally don‚Äôt care at all about it or give it any personal consideration\n\nCrybabies. How utterly pathetic.\n\nThis is absolutely pathetic from them\n\nThey've just been absolutely battered at home by their biggest rivals and they've decided to pull their own pants down in front of the whole world. What an abysmal week for Real Madrid\n\nIt just gets better and better üòÇ\n\nA lot of people here are missing the fact they knew Rodri was the winner before the ceremony even started. So right there and then that absolutely diminishes any sense of surprise the show would‚Äôve had leading up to the BD winner. Once they caught wind of that, knowing Vini obviously deserves it this year, why the fuck would they go? \n\nHate on Real all you want, Vini is the clear winner at least for this year. That‚Äôs not taking anything from Rodri, he‚Äôs incredible, but Vini is the clear winner. You‚Äôd be an arrogant fool to argue anything else.\n\nReal cunts\n\nCan't read shit because of all the ads.\n\n114\n\nHey u/tylerthe-theatre could you link to the official statement, please. Because there‚Äôs just a mirror article\n\nI can understand them boycotting and not going but issuing an official statement is just over the top and childishü§£\n\nClassless\n\nHow can rodri win balloon d'or if he's not even the best player in his team? \n\nWill never understand the criteria in this prize..\n\nWell that‚Äôs great news. Trent will now stay at Liverpool because Real Madrid are not respected and their players cannot win the ballon d‚Äôor.\n\nThey are REALly entitled huh.\n\nI find it extremely arrogant to not be part of the cerimony when you have 3 players in the top 4, I mean Rodri isn‚Äôt better than Vinicius, but you have to let the man win, he won‚Äôt probably have another chance in his career (?) and you have to learn to lose. Also I am shocked Antony isn‚Äôt in the top 3.\n\nPutting trophies aside for a sec, as we would have to give it to Carvajal who won it all.\n\nHow is Rodri even better than Kross? ü§£\n\nImagine Oscar noms behaved like this\n\nLove how they complain about nobody respecting them and they go and do something which will make everyone respect them even less.\n\nspanish team boycotting the first spanish winner in 60 years\n\nembarrassing clowns\n\nWorst club in the world. Spoiled brats\n\nBunch of cry baby shit\n\nVinni crying like a bitch! It saddens me that RM did this. \n\nI actually thought he was more deserving, but at the same time Rodri also had an amazing season. Clearly the deciding factor was national team performance. Spain won Euro‚Äôs, and Rodri was also player of the tournament. And at the same time, Vinni disappeared and Brazil played horribly in Copa America.\n\nyour team has nothing going for it and you can only find pleasure talking shit about the most successful club in the world.\n\nLong time Madrid fan here, congrats to Rodri, he is special. My son plays midfield and that is the player I told him to watch first and foremost. Any drama surrounding this award is wasted energy.\n\nHonestly, Ballon d'Or should now boycott Real Madrid from their future awards. What a bunch of entitled narcissists, thinking that the game revolves around them.\n\nI p.\n\nThe sooner people find out what a joke individual awards are in team sports this wont end. Rodri would trade this for any (somewhat esteemed) team trophy, I guarantee it.\n\nThis is beyond embarrassing from a club the size and stature of Madrid.\n\nI don't like real anymore\n\nThats pathetic. Real is the rich kid at school, who is used to get everything they want. Football won. Vini has no class.\n\nFuck Real\n\nIf the classiest team of all time has been this petty, you know you fucked up bad\n\nIdk why everyone thinks the balon d‚Äôor is a goalscoring/assist award, its not\n\nIs this just the case of Real Madrid spitting their dummy out as they didn‚Äôt win it?\n\nDid Real Madrid really talkes about themselves in 3. person? Funny.\n\nSpoilt twit\n\nYou know in your heart vini deserved this¬†\n\nThey should have boycotted their game against Barcelona.\n\nThe narrative they are pushing is that \"rodri didnt do anything in premier league and wasnt the best player for spain\". I swear these people dont watch football its crazy.\n\nMadrid just look like childish brats. PR disaster.\n\nPathetic\n\nJust hilarious fucking toddlers\n\nSix Real players were in the shortlist of thirty.. it‚Äôs been leaked that Vini isn‚Äôt going to win so they are boycotting the event.. so who is being disrespectful UEFA or Real? \nAnd they wonder why fans hate them ..\n\nI have zero respect for Real after this. It's entitled and childish. Have to say I have noticed an increase in bad behavior by real team members on the pitch if they don't get their own way. Almost as though they should get special treatment. Sounds like they are heading for problems if they have a culture like that developing.\n\nEmbarrassing.\n\nPathetic. Losers.\n\nHow salah hasn't won one is beyond me, every year he gets ignored, absolutely class and so consistent.\n\nDon‚Äôt remember Haaland acting like Vini Jnr when he was robbed of the Ballon d‚Äôor last year.\n\nWhen Vini didn't take the ball from kimmich, it was actually the \"ballon dor\" that fell from his hands\n\nReal issue üòû\n\nIt‚Äôs a disgrace. I\n\nHe should never be nominated after such stupid behavior\n\nüò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ So sad...\n\nFcb fans won two trophies in 1 week\nTrophy 1 : won against rma 4-0\nTrophy 2 : vini didn't win the ballon d'or\n\nNo, but this club is a shame.\nWho do they think they are?\n\nOnly 24 goals as a striker, and not performing for your national team, won‚Äôt win you world best player. In comparison, Kane scored 52 and Rodri‚Äôs goal involvements was only 10 less, as a defensive midfielder.\n\nOn top of that, the euroes counts more than champions league. And Premier league is bigger than la liga.\n\nThe entitlement is real. \"How dare these hundred  different people from different countries not all agree that our best player is the best?\"\n\nBunch of arrogant twots. \n\nOur player didn't win so we won't be coming. Pathetic, childish and disrespectful. Great way to show millions of kids how to behave. nobs\n\nSour grapes\n\nI‚Äôm no city fan, in fact, can‚Äôt stand the club but Rodri is an incredible player and 100% worthy of the award. Even if I don‚Äôt respect the club, I can respect the talent they put on the pitch and Rodri is one of the best in the business.\n\nMaybe it's not about RM. Manchester City should've taken a stand for Haaland. He was robbed. Bayern should've taken a stand for Lewandowski. This award has been bullshit for a long time, and maybe organizations should be able to critique it without being called spoiled or entitled.\n\nNo player is bigger than the club...and no club is bigger than the game. Not even Real Madrid.\n\nThey won team of the year for ffs. Wtf is this ‚Äúnobody respects us‚Äù from them? Fuck em, plastic players the lot of them. Haaland showed up to get robbed, the least these clowns can do is show face, instead of crying about being cooked by a 17 year old.¬†\n\nRobbed when not one of them win it, but truly deserved when one of them did. \n\nEntitle little twerps, like the fat lil kid who owns the ball when we were kids and when he‚Äôs not picked, he took away the ball sulking.\n\nSounds like a 5 year old going in the huff at not getting their own way.\n\nMajor achievment from real making fc115 almost likeableü§°. Award was voted by journalists across the europe and real of all the clubs giving us this impression that it was some sort of filthy cabinet fraud. Weldone.üëè"

Just wonderful footballing!\n\nYou forgot Italy\n\nIt is indeed deserved, their way to the trophy was more difficult than England. Yet, England could have done better\n\nMy boy Kane can‚Äôt win shit dawgüò≠üò≠\n\nHe looked broken. As someone who has lower back disk problems, Kane shouldn't have been playing at all. England didn't have a striker for 65 minutes...\n\nSomething defo looks wrong. He walked into the pitch at the start like someone who had shat themselves.¬†\n\nIm convinced he‚Äôs still carrying an injury. He missed a good few games at the end of Bayerns season with a back injury. I‚Äôm not entirely convinced he‚Äôs fully recovered based off how he‚Äôs played. He‚Äôs got form for it as well, I‚Äôm sure he started against Liverpool in the UCL final after a bad ankle injury and wasn‚Äôt fully fit for that game\n\nYo boy Kane, he got the curse. He needs a witch doctor or something.\n\nMonkey's paw. He wished to become a great striker. The consequence is that he may never win a team trophy.\n\nJust a regular doctor.\n\nYou can leave tott. spurs but tott. spurs won‚Äôt leave you\n\nBro if he doesn‚Äôt win something soon managers might actually get gaslit into thinking he is and be soldüò≠ by\n\nI'm an Arsenal fan so it pains me to say this but...it worked for Bale\n\nBale actually won a trophy at Spurs\n\n‚ÄúMost Improved Player‚Äù?\n\nLeague Cup 2008\n\nI‚Äôm out in public and you just made me cackle out loud like an old witch! Good one!\n\nHis last chance is Saudi leagues lol\n\nHe played like crap for the majority of the tournament.\n\nAt least he could be considered the best CDM this tournament.\n\nFair play to Spain. They were the better team. Kane should not have started any games in that tournament. Like a tanker turning\n\nThat's because england was playing to counter. For that, Kane is too slow.\n\nThat‚Äôs on ‚ÄòVibes‚Äô Southgate\n\nLet‚Äôs not kid ourselves even with the ball at his feet nothing was working the ball would bounce off him, he never even held the ball up or won headers. He was utterly useless in every game other than scoring some tap ins and a penalty\n\nI feel like this could *also* describe Morata.\n\nThis is the most well deserved international tournament win I've seen since Brazil in 2002. \n\n7 wins in 7 games. No penalties, only one extra time. The most important of all, they played like the best team in the tournament. \n\nPlayed against every contender and shown that they were better. Not just with the result, even more so with their football.\n\nnot trying to be that guy but germany in 2014 was at least imo very well deserved and dominant. just one draw and a 18:4 goal difference in 7 games and obviously the utter destruction of brazil.\n\nBrazil 2002 in Korea? I'm sure that I'm not the only Belgian who felt so completely robbed after their game against us. Disallowed goal for supposedly being a foul, which clearly was not a foul by any stretch of the imagination. [Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGwjQqXu_IM) the goal. [Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oq7J1RnzVGM) Wilmots talking about it with a different angle. It's even worse than I remembered. Daylight robbery.\n\nThis was followed by continuous referee decisions which inexplicably favored Brazil, one of them resulting in a goal. I know that as a small country, you can't expect much from a referee in a big tournament but that game really stands out in my mind in all my years of watching our national team. The only time I felt legit like our team got robbed. Clearly I wasn't the only one judging by the Youtube comments, haha.\n\nThe game vs Germany was a bit lucky tho\n\nJust to note everyone, neville said spain wont win cause of cucurella only for him to give the game winning assist\n\nWalker caught out for both of Spains  goals, just like at home - he‚Äôs not good at covering himself\n\nImagine it was Trent.. wont see the media scathing him the way they would the Scouser\n\nMainoo ignoring Olmo on the first goal forced Walker to cover him, which left Nico wide open\n\nReally did he talked about Cucurella? He performed superb during the tournament.\n\nTo be fair he was grossly out of position when the play that originated England‚Äôs equalisers started\n\nIt wasn't that bad, he was in the in the cb postion cause the cb was also out of postion\n\nThat doesn't make Neville any less wrong and pathetic.\n\nYou can't justify sitting back when you are in a good position to seal the game. And why does pickford has to play long shot everytime. Each and every goal kick, the possession is lost. Keeping Watkins and Palmer as \"finishers\" seemed nonsense.\n\nNo neutral football fan would say England deserved to win this Tournament.\n\nI mean let‚Äôs be real yes tactically it‚Äôs not the best but England were losing the ball in the final half and even the final third a decent amount of the time they tried playing from the back off of Spains pressing. I don‚Äôt blame him from feeling the pressure when his half his defensive line is super gassed \n\nAnd I mean even England fans are saying they didn‚Äôt deserve to win the tournament since the group stages lmao\n\nCongrats Spain, well deserved üèÜ\n\nBest team won in the end, gutted to have lost another final - but we go again, WC qualifiers in September!\n\nLamine Yamal value: üìàüìàüìà\n\nWhile the lad is definitely good for his age, i was way more impressed by Williams,a real menace to defenders\n\nSpain has finally risen to the top again after a barren decade since the golden generation - VIVA LA ESPANA\n\nAs an English person calling a decade without a major trophy barren seems crazy. It'll be 60 in 2026...\n\nAnd none without cheating.\n\nSo much youngesters . Spain will win wc\n\nSpain have so many good players not even on the squad it‚Äôs mad.\n\nAbsolutely deserved, Spain played fantastic football the whole tournament and look incredible all around. Their trophy is even more impressive when you look at the teams they played, just incredible. Congratulations, Espana!\n\nFrom a Brit, congratulations to Spain. Deserving champions. \n\nI‚Äôm so frustrated with England. We battled to get it to 1-1, and if we had managed to take it to penalties (which would have been a huge ask), we probably had a decent chance of winning it.\n\nAs much as I wanted Southgate to win, he has been too reactive in this tournament. It‚Äôs obvious which players give England spark, and more threat, yet they only ever come on when we are behind or searching for something in the final stages of the game. \n\nHad we started with more front footed players in the beginning of the match we might have caused more problems for Spain in the first half.\n\nSo disappointed but it‚Äôs all becoming too familiar now.\n\nThe thing I find with England is we focus so much on the past failures and victories yet never on how to get there. We play players time in and time out past their prime due to records and stats (Beckham, Rooney, Kane) who never perform and who will get us some goals but past a point will not win. The media puts so much on the players they have the most overhyped labels and overhyped pressure that to not win makes them all get hate from everyone. We need to handle pressure a lot more and play players in the positions they want to and not how a defensive manager wants to because that is how we get goals and not place everyone at the back for 70 minutes.  \nI feel what England needs is more players who can play in the big games and not fold. Bellingham and Palmer have done this to me, but Foden and Kane have not due to positioning and timidness. It is proven to me watching this tournament that Southgate cannot adapt and the players look quaky in big games. my current theory to this is due to the failures and victories; no one wants to make mistakes because they know they will get targetted. Spain played without fear and won, and I do not see their media say we need to win because we have not in a few years like the English. \n\nIt is time we change how we react, we need to get more critical and I think that starts by removing Southgate, getting new people in the FA who actually can pick managers that play to the players strength and move on. I want someone to come in and play football the players can be proud of, and I want the media and fans to stop saying we will win and we need to win or we won in 1966. That is the past, we need to look to the future and the future is change to a degree I feel can lift us from good/lucky to an actually solid side with solid players and tactics.\n\nYour point about players being scared of mistakes in big games. To be fair, I think this is maybe one area Southgate has done well. I‚Äôm referencing the penalties against the Netherlands that got us through to the finals. All of those penalties that the players took were great penalties, there were no fear despite their youth. The point is magnified with Saka who missed last penalty in the last Euro against Italy. The fact he was willing to take a penalty shows Southgate‚Äôs staff has done well helping him to overcome fear. \n\nI agree about Southgate playing these old tried and trusted players. I just wished Southgate was willing to put more trust in youth. Look at Spain playing 17 year old Yamal. Fuente had no fear playing the kid in all of Spain‚Äôs games. Yet Southgate was afraid to start Palmer, Watkins. Even Gordon and Eze, didn‚Äôt get a look in.\n\nSouthgate‚Äôs downfall is his tactics. Yes, it got us to the finals but let‚Äôs not kid ourselves because we were going out of the competition against Slovakia! When asked about Kane‚Äôs performance after the game. He said Kane has had a long season and was probably tired etc etc. Well, why start him against a team like Spain when you know full well we‚Äôll be chasing the ball most of the time?\n\nTo play devils advocate to this though, not one of the players who took pens are not elite at them. Only one who had demons was saka and I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs missed one since the euros before. Southgate is a painfully average manager managing a world beating squad of talent. Needs to go\n\nOh yeah, those pens were a great display of them not being fearful; Saka is super brave and showed class to take one. I was more referring to players not taking risks in terms of running into the box or running forward.\n\nI've seen a lot of that this tournament, playing it back and side to side with no real runners in the middle to get onto the box to get a goal or chance to shoot. Saw this tonight with Kane a few times where he should have run into the box even though I feel he is not in the correct position for the team (should play the role he does at Bayern). \n\nI don't really see why in a lot of games we dropped back and never really ran into the box or take those sorta attacking plays in a lot of the games, especially the group stages, as anything but the manager telling them to do it for his tactics. It is frustrating to watch sometimes like that nil nil draw and see players pass sideways, and no one moves forward and gets a shot in. I think the FA really needs to think about hiring Southgate because two finals lost in a row proves to me he is not a big game manager, but again it is the case of who would be a good fit to replace him?\n\nFor England, to play mostly below par and reached an international final scares me because imagine if they had a coach who can transfer the players league's form on the global stage with tactical nous... if only.\n\nOr they faced poor to average opposition up until the final where they faced a good team for the first time and were soundly beaten, the score-line flattered England.\n\nThis. England met one good opponent and reached the final. I have never seen a team with such an easy draw before.\n\nThey weren't that soundly beaten. Come on. More like self sabotage; they made Cucurella look R. Carlos.\n\nFirst half was even, second half Spain adjusted and should‚Äôve had 3 goals in that window before the equaliser. Standard Southgate cycle of being bailed out by the quality in the team. Praying he calls it quits now after losing to a team of similar calibre for the 4th tournament in a row\n\ntbf cucurella has lookled like roberto carlos since the start of the tournament\n\nEngland didn't play any good team up until the final. \nReaching the final was an easy task that they made to look so hard\n\nYet Spain had the hardest road to the final, and made it look so easy\n\nBased on league form, we've got a crazy good side, and that's where the heavy expectation comes from. \n\nWe see Kane with almost a goal a game in Germany \nWe see Bellingham being the top scorer at Real Madrid.\nWe see Foden and Palmer getting player and young player of the season.\nRice and Saka leading a title chase for Arsenal.\nWatkins and Bowen on fire.\nKobbie Mainoo.\n\nI feel like the expectation is that we should play like a galactico filled Real Madrid.\n\nIt's frustrating to be an England fan right now but I'm not that bitter. Spain really showed up for this tourney.\n\nThey had easiest path to finals I've ever seen in multiple tournaments¬†\n\nCongrats Spain. Spain clearly deserved it today, and throughout the tournament they were simply the best.\n\nI'm not even mad. England have been so bad this tournament that it would have been a crime against nature to have won it. Spain were superb. I'm glad we gave them a game and didn't embarrass ourselves too badly.\n\nFootball can also be fair sometimes üëèüèΩüá™üá∏\n\nCongrats from an England fan, well deserved\n\nEngland were awful the entire first half.\n\nEngland were worst at 1-1. They were ok until they equalised, albeit Spain were the better team overall. Deserved champions, England were 3rd best team in the tournament at best.\n\nThat's cause any good team will put 3 men on Kane to shut him down completely. That's what Italy did, and it's what Spain did tonight. England scored because after subbing Kane, the defense needed time to restrategize to a pacey threat.\n\nIt was a good call by Southgate to sub Kane off, but in my mind, a better strategy would have been to start without him, then bring him on later to scramble the defense when they're already baked into the current strategy. Small difference, but much more difficult as a defender mentally.\n\nBut what do I know? I don't play at top levels, just my two cents from my sofa.\n\nExtremely charitable to say they were 3rd best. They were outplayed by every team bar the Dutch, who were dreadful, while also having the incredible fortune of not having to play anyone particularly good.\n\n? Game was far more even then than in the second half. Only time we looked alive in the second was post equaliser for about 10 minutes\n\nI don't think they were bad. I just think Spain were just so good it made England look bad.\n\nEngland haven‚Äôt had a single good match under Southgate\n\nDidn't pass the ball to Saka enough\n\nThis. Until Palmer and Watkins came on, Saka was the only English player to be a consistent threat.\n\nActing like they had the ball enough to even pass it to Saka. 37% possession in the finals is pityful.\n\nBut yeah when he got the ball he actually managed to do something with it.\n\n35% actually\n\nThey didn't have the ball in the first place.\n\nRight now I'm a wholebunch of pints in.  Gutted as usual but well done to Spain\n\nSpain deserved it. Best team the whole tournament\n\nEngland fan here, and this is the easiest I've taken one of these losses in a long time. Spain have been the best team in the tournament, and England feel like a team which is just about to blossom with an influx of new blood. Harry Kane is one of the greatest England players we've ever had, but I think it's time for him to become he impact sub, rather than the Plan A. It's not like Kane's fallen of or anything, but the other attacking players we have are more suited to playing a different style of football than the one which suits Kane as a lone striker. I think it's time to have a look at resetting this teams tactics and really playing to the strengths of the new generation of players we've got coming through.\n\nSpain was the class of the tournament by miles.\n\nMy fave part of the final was seeing Mainoo with his hands down the front of his pants, by the goal afterwards, like he was chilling on some dodgy council estate in London, lol.\n\nFelicidades\n\nYou cannot win if you re playing 65 minutes without a striker\n\nIf I have to be brutally honest‚Ä¶.\nThey deserved it!!\n\nLets be honest, that England went to the final was a result of them playing far weaker teams and then still needing an incredible amount of luck.\n\nSouthgate cycle lol. Needs to be investigated, I‚Äôve never seen any other manager ever have such favourable draws\n\nIt's not coming homeüó£Ô∏è\n\nWow such comedy. Did you think of that all by yourself?\n\n*are\n\nThe tribalism this year seems a lot worse than last time¬†\n\nDe la Fuente has been managing in the Spanish national team system(under 19,21, Olympics and now the senior team) for over ten years,an interesting plan that has worked out well for Spain.\n\nAnd he's won at all those levels also.\n\nThey were the better team and had lots more goal chances. England played a sit back kind of game while Spain went for the win. Well deserved\n\nHurts bad man\n\nThe SECOND it hit 4 minutes OT, in a tournarment filled with the longest OTs in game after game. Hillarious.\n\nThis was not the tournament with the longest OTs at all, lol. They greatly adjusted the guidance down for this tournament.\n\nYeah especially on the last play they should have let pickford hammer it to the other side since spanish players were on the ground for like 1 minute and a half in OT\n\nIndeed. Not sure what Pickford was playing at but hammer to the other side pretty much summed up his performance.\n\nRight? 90 of those 240 seconds were spent with a player on the floor. Ref didn't even allow Pickford to take that last free kick. Literally waited for the minute to end and blew his whistle. \n\nDon't get me wrong, Spain absolutely deserved the win, but that was silly.\n\nYep. Slightly ridiculous. England hate forever and ever but to be fair that's not right\n\nCould have given England another 94 minutes and they wouldn‚Äôt have scored\n\nThere is nothing better than watching England lose a gold. Well played Spain - great football that is also fun to watch!\n\nWhy so much hate? Just enjoy the game..\n\nBest team won. I feel England would have been eliminated a long time ago had they been on the other side of the bracket.\n\nComparatively the teams were far weaker on England's side. Same as last euros.\n\nWell deserved Spain!! üá™üá∏\n\nI hate Bellingham\n\nHe doesn‚Äôt even know you exist.\n\n congratulations Spain best team in the tournament by a mile\n\nCongratulations Spain!! Outplayed England outright. Now go fill the trophy full of Nachos\n\nNot out right.\n\nWe were shite\n\nSouthgate needs the sack. The first team to loose back to back euro finals. Absolute tosspot.\n\nAlso first team to get to back to back with England? \n\nRemember the golden generation? \n\nI‚Äôd rather get to a final and lose, than have the golden generation not get past a quarter final. \n\nYou guys all have short term memory\n\nHey they atleast got to finals back to back\n\nthat‚Äôs the joke. england still didn‚Äôt win but southgate has got to more finals and semifinals than any previous england manager\n\nLoser mentality\n\nAll I want is Gareth Southgate to ruin the golden generation\n\nAwful take. No other manager has even managed to get there in the first place.\n\nLose*\n\nSTFU, Southgate has outperformed every manager of recent years - the team played well and were outplayed by a great Spanish team - people like you just embarrass yourselves\n\nAt least he reached the finals üíÄ\n\nthe best quality team deservedly won\n\nHarry Maguire would've head that goal in for sure üòÅ\n\nHow do you guys rate Moratas tournament?\n\nSince the new year, he seems to be mostly incapable of scoring - a pretty neat trait for a striker I‚Äôd say.\n\nAs a general nuisance for the opposition I found him to be someone you want on your team, and hate to play against. The constant looking for challenges and falling, the talking‚Ä¶ annoying as hell in a good way.\n\nNow where I rate him highly is as a captain. I mainly noticed it in the finals, but he is there for the youngsters, for the coach, for the high-spirit attitude. Reminded me a bit of C. Ronaldo as captain.\n\nAll in all I‚Äôd say it was a mediocre performance and I‚Äôm sure he had higher expectations of himself.\n\nNow we see if Colombia can pull the same in the Copa. They're the ESP in that final with ARG playing the England role.\n\nCongrats to Spain.\n\nVery well deserved!!\n\nmy bets on eddie howe for england\n\nEngland doesn‚Äôt get football.\n\nr\n\nIt was a really good final, England can be proud.\n\nI was rooting for England, but Spain was the better team. Well deserved.\n\nI guess it‚Äôs not coming home, is it?\n\nI was waiting for England to do a rocky and switch style for the final. They did for a while after going a goal down but it was too late. It was very entertaining and fair play to both teams for a good final.\n\nEngland fan:\n\nWell done to Spain! I think both teams started off nervously for most of the first half. A few attempts here and there but nothing to write home about. \n\nSecond half Spain bolted off to a fantastic start with a quick goal, probably the best way to go about it. I think England put in a good performance for most of the second half, but tactically we were failed. We had no striker (in essence), maybe the remnants of an injury? Not to take anything away from Spain.\n\nWe kept going but once we equalised, we just sat back like it would change anything - it was like the first half all over again. Spain did great with the second goal and yeah - it was extremely disappointing to get so close but lose. I have a lot more comments about individual players' performances, but well done to Spain. You absolutely smashed it. I was gutted for the team, but it just makes me look forward to club football in August. YNWA!\n\nGlad for them. They're one of the rare few teams that have actually looked good throughout the competition. One of the only ones that would've been worthy winners.\n\nI don‚Äôt understand how England defense just turned off in the second half.\n\nWhat's Football ? Is it new ?\n\nI‚Äôve always hated the Spanish team(s) but this time I can‚Äôt help but congratulate them\n\nthank the lord.\n\nWish Jamal scored that\n\nFair play to Spain\n\nSpain took ‚Äúto be the best you have to beat the best‚Äù literally and did that shit\n\n[removed]\n\nI predicted that England would win. Well, my prediction was wrong. Both teams played well.\n\nAs a Swiss fan I was disappointed to lose against England. I felt we had the team to reach the final, I'm convinced of that. But there's no way we had a chance against Spain. They were the team of the tournament and deserved to win it. They played beautiful football and were the most exciting team by far.\n\nArent we all champions tonight really tho?\n\nI'm devastated\n\nYeah Spain won UEFA Euro\n\nOur saviour SPAIN!! TIME FOR TEA PARTY!!!\n\nlove seeing saka suffering\n\nGreat game! England did well - but Spain had too much juice!\n\nEngland fan here. They deserved it, fair play to them\n\nWe the Irish salute you. ü´°\n\nand its annoying as fuck\n\nFootball is saved\n\nEngland scoring the MOMENT kane was taken off and STILL LOSING is proof the harry kane curse is real\n\nAre you\n\nWell, time to get violently hungover\n\nThey deserved it absolutely.\n\nSpain have been phenomenal during the tournament. Well deserved\n\nGreat, so now that the games are over, can we seize the means of production? Thx\n\nYes they are¬†\n\nThe truth is, that was some of the worst England performances back-to-back for several games in a row. They pulled out some magic to get to the Final but in reality, you can't rely on that to win every single game. Obviously, hindsight is 20:20 but Rice &amp; maybe Foden should've probably gone off when Mainoo did - they both felt a bit lost without Mainoo's constantly man-marking and having great positioning. Rice's possession stats are horrific in that match and having 35% possession as a team vs any Spanish side is a death penalty.\n\nEngland are also too reliant on Pickford just banging the ball down the pitch - that's not getting you far when Spain's midfield are some of the most active pressers I've seen, as soon as a dangerous English player has the ball, they swarm them without giving up position on the pitch so they can easily win the ball AND break. It was very impressive, very calculated and very successful. England REALLY needed fresh legs to counter it.\n\nBut the better team won, the best team of the tournament won and the team with the most stand-out players won - so it's nothing to be ashamed about from England's perspective. Spain could go into World Cup as favourites if this keeps up and their squad is all fit to play.\n\nMagic met reality.\n\nI think if England has started the match with the lineup the finished it, they may have put up more of a fight. That, and tying Pickford's boots together to stop his hoof-ball.\n\nI betted for England to lift the cup right from the beginning of the tournament. Losing my bet in the last game didn't hurt at all, because I had already given up hope on them since round of 16s...\n\nYouaaa forgot the spaghetti ü§å\n\nCounter-Terrorists Win!"

You probably think OJ Simpson is a stand up guy and Michael Jackson just liked being friends with kids\n\nYep this is spot on¬†\n\nyou sound like another city fan sticking their head in the sand. you're asking two unrelated questions.\n\nA ruling won't change people's minds about this because they don't have the memory of a goldfish. Corruption in the sport is not something city invented. Clubs do it because they often *weren't* caught or punished for it in a meaningful way.\n\nAlso, let's say city is found guilty, or just punished for not complying; if they get a slap on the wrist compared to everton, who complied, then people will get ideas about why. If their process seems to disincentivize compliance, what do you expect? Even Chelsea complied.\n\nYour missing a very important FACT Everton admitted that they broke the rules . It has yet to be proven that city did\n\n\n\n\"Also, let's say city is found guilty, or just punished for not complying; if they get a slap on the wrist compared to everton, who complied, then people will get ideas about why. If their process seems to disincentivize compliance, what do you expect? Even Chelsea complied.\"\n\nI do not think they are missing anything.\n\nThere‚Äôs a difference between compliance and admission of guilt\n\nthe point you are making is completely flying over my head\n\nnah, they're still utter dogshit and at best significantly under par. but it'd be a decent step in the right direction!\n\nThe FA have nothing to do with this case,\n\nIndependent judges pass the judgement and they could be jailed/struck off of they're paid off...\n\nCalendar year not premier league year?\n\nYes, calendar year.\n\nBased on a single line in an Athletic article, which was probably wrong.\n\n3 points deduction and a sternly worded letter propably\n\nI mean does a 20 point deduction even hurt them?\n\nNo champions league for 1 season, how will they be able to pay their players?\n\nBy pretending they‚Äôre paying them less I‚Äôd imagine. Cars maybe? How were they paying Mancini again?\n\nTwice\n\nLet‚Äôs see if the players can hack it as consultants for Etihad-adjacent companies in the Middle East that definitely have nothing to do with City.\n\nYeah, the whole squad will take pay cuts. But wait, Erling Harland is now an Etihad Airways customer experience director. With a ¬£5m annual salary\n\nYou mean his dad Alfie Haaland.\n\nAh that's an avenue I hadn't thought of. Yes all the parents will be Etihad employees\n\nJust give them half a football club each\n\n&gt;No champions league for 1 season\n\nThey finished 25 points above 5th last season so there's a chance a 20 point deduction would not even result in that.\n\nThe only season since Pep in which a 20 point deduction would have kicked them out of top 4 was 19/20. Absurd.\n\n500 billion naming rights deal for the staff canteen?\n\nWell if they miss CL they might breach PSR as well so they could have to sell players\n\n20 points less than last season would still get them in\n\n20 points less for 7 of the last 8 seasons would still get them in\n\nWould be hilarious if they were docked 20 points this season and still win.\n\n20 point deduction wouldn't stop them getting Champions League. 70 points always gets you in and they usually hit 90. And if 5th is enough, they'd only need about 85 points for UCL\n\nCity could also win the Champions League this year and qualification through that way too.\n\n4 of the last 5 seasons would have still seen them qualify for the Champions League with a 20 point deduction\n\nBy repeating those 115 charges\n\nMaybe a point for every charge? Or perhaps 2 per charge if only the 60 non-cooperation ones.\n\nSome more non existing sponsors maybe?\n\nWould 20 points even get them out of the Champions League? They finished 25 clear of 5th place last season. And assuming that English clubs get the extra CL spot, 27 clear of 6th.\n\n7th is usually good enough for Europe, and they were 31 clear of that. And if they knew a cup was the only way in, they'd take every round seriously and most likely win.\n\nCan the FA just ban them from Europe? What about UEFA if they were the holders?\n\nI don't think the FA can ban them from Europe, but they can demote them as many divisions as they want, refuse then entry into competitions etc\n\nNot in the last 7 out of 8 seasons.\n\nIt wont be 20. Where's the deterrent in that? 200 more like.\n\nThe letter will say \n\nDear Manchester City,\n\nDon't do it again!\n\nSigned\n\nThe FA\n\n(please)\n\nAnd the deduction will be postponed until they will the league by at least 4 points\n\nMore like -10 for Everton and a penalty to City.\n\nA *last minute* penalty to City... against Everton\n\nFor Everton?\n\nmaybe just a 150 million fine lol. the penalty to spending too much money is.... give us some money too\n\nFor Everton, right?\n\nDeduction going to Everton though\n\n200k fine, half of it suspended\n\nAnd 10 points deduction from Everton\n\nOr a fine‚Ä¶..\n\nAs in ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre fine‚Äù\n\nPoints off from Everton surely\n\nAnd 100¬£ fine as well.\n\nLet's make it 5 points and 10 millions fine so they almost consider to take it higher up to refight it!\n\n12 points.\n\n\n\nFor Everton.\n\nAn ‚Äúunprecedented‚Äù fine and a stern rebuke.\n\nEverton to be relegated to Hackney marshes.\n\nit going fast is either very good for them or very bad, can‚Äôt imagine it‚Äôs something in the middle\n\nGoing fast means lawyers behind closed doors have come to an agreement, probably with UK govt involvement as to not upset trade. I forsee a large financial penalty, staggered over many years, perhaps a ban on transfer activity for a season, and maybe 3-9 points deducted.\n\nBasically a slap on the wrist.\n\nCan‚Äôt wait for the newly sponsored Eithad Premier League next season to the tune of ¬£500m a year.\n\nSurely the FA ain't going to fall to government pressure, because thats full grounds to be removed from FIFA comps, and are the FA really going to risk that for a single club.\n\nIt's going to be one hell of a cluster fuck either way\n\nFIFA keeps falling to government pressure. Wouldn't be Qatar/Saudi WCs otherwise. Didn't they also effectively force the Australian FA to cancel their hosting application to guarantee Saudi's win?\n\nFifa should be raided by police again and closed down, football should force a new Fifa from scratchs\n\nFIFA doesn't have guts to ban England, they only flex muscles to small countries¬†\n\nProblem is it sets a precedent, they allow it now then they can't stop smaller nations doing similar in future.\n\nThat‚Äôs what I‚Äôm thinking cause it would be a massive scandal if that got out. Can you imagine the headlines if the UK government was caught getting involved in football for a foreign government.\n\nLol no. Every team will do it next season\n\nIt's where the sport is headed anyways. \n\nProxy war between middle eastern countries. And some American business men for good measure.\n\nThere is no way they're getting a 3 point deduction for 115 charges when Everton got 10 points for 2 charges. The rest of the Premier League clubs would bring Hell down on the whole organisation.\n\n115 not proven charges they‚Äôre absolutely not co-operating with having done. Everton were open and honest, probably to their detriment. City have always made sure to make anything they‚Äôve done passable if they get called out on it, and absolutely are fighting every charge.\n\nThey will have one or two sacrificial charges they‚Äôll admit, get a slap on the wrist, and the rest will be unproven. They‚Äôre not unaware that if not done carefully they could be done for the way they‚Äôve built themselves as a top club. And they have the money to pay the best to make it murky as fuck.\n\nThe thing is though, because there's 115( it's actually more now)charges they could have the book thrown at them for obstruction too\n\nMan City‚Äôs legal team would go after them for that, the fact it‚Äôs taking this length of time means its not simple and they‚Äôll argue that they interpreted it legally as something else that is totally above board. And the FA going at them for obstruction is them not getting them on any charges and having a strop, and inventing something to get them for.\n\n\nAnd escalate it to higher courts than football alone. FA will not risk that.\n\nThe premier league will argue they deliberately obstructed UEFA until evidence was time barred and it had nothing to do with complexity of case. \n\nAlso, it wouldn't matter because the premier league are judge jury and executioner. It's certainly not them having a strop because you've requested evidence to investigate or attain innocence and you're being blocked. This would be like saying in the real world judges throw strops when they sentence criminals for not helping when guilt is obvious \n\nObviously they'd go to CAS, but the premier league could obstruct that\n\nThey aren‚Äôt exempt from CAS like you pointed out nor are they exempt from government oversight. \n\nI agree that you‚Äôre spot on that‚Äôs what they‚Äôve actually done. But maybe my pessimism and the fact that a bottomless pit of money can get some right good bastard lawyers, City will come away with a slap on the wrist, with only some lesser charges of the 114, ones they‚Äôre happy with and probably hang out as a sacrificial low hanging fruit, so the FA feel like they got them on something and aren‚Äôt completely toothless\n\nIt was always more than 115, that‚Äôs how shite the reporting about it has been\n\nGoing fast probably means they‚Äôve got to a point that City‚Äôs legal team wanted. Anything else they‚Äôd drag it on.\n\nI suspect most outcomes are pretty binary for them, regardless of pace.\n\n‚Ä¶Everton are getting relegated, aren‚Äôt they? üòî\n\nRed card for Casemiro.\n\n\"It's all Pogba's fault\" - Souness\n\n‚ÄúWhy always me?‚Äù - Balotelli\n\n10 second penalty for Ocon\n\nI‚Äôm bored of this now, I want to get on and start complaining about the token wrist slap punishment already\n\nRight ? Might as well get it over with already!\n\nCity winning this or getting slapped on the wrist will be horrendous precedent. Newcastle is going to fly into action in a very conspicuous way. Enjoy oil clasico, fellas, because it's the new big game.\n\nNo sane person can expect anything more than slap on the wrist considering how deep in throat UK has UAE's dick.\n\nReports a while ago said that the PL were worried about the government becoming football's regulator and that they wanted to show that it wasn't necessary. If I was the PM and an Arsenal fan, I'd fucking *nationalise* them for not relegating City. Stand up and be counted, Sir Keir.\n\nFIFA have also threatened the FA with a ban if they let the government regulate them, so presumably they'd want to do anything in their power to avoid that.\n\n\nWhich doesn't involve letting city get away with blatantly cheating\n\nI don‚Äôt know. Football fans make up a huge group of people. That‚Äôs not a group that the UK govt want to upset en-masse. Football probably does more for the economy than trade with the UAE. \n\nThe risk of leaks and whistleblowers and public inquiry after the fact means that some kind of punishment is likely. They will try to punish enough to avoid pushback without upsetting the other interested parties.\n\nLet's be honest, if they won't be punished, fans of PL teams won't stop watching PL. If some of them will, it will be absolute marginal.\n\nExactly. People don't want to admit it.¬†\n\nYep, exactly.\n\nI'm not sure I buy the political angle, but if there is an issue, I think it's that the premier league feel they need to punish city so as to avoid getting a regulator, but are also aware that the government may not want them punished too much. \n\nPremier league is of value, EY say about ¬£8bn a year to the UK economy, but UK UAE share trade of about ¬£20bn, never mind all the other stuff. \n\nIf the UK government is likely to pressure the league to do anything, and as I said, I am not sure they are, i doubt it will be to encourage them to be more harsh.\n\nWhat do we even consider a serious punishment?  \nThey could deduct from them 20 points this season and it won't matter. It's just a season lost.  \nWhat about the titles they won while cheating?  \nThey turned this into a farmer's league so even if they get punished seriously I don't see how it will matter.  \nSo I actually think they will get some serious point deductions so that people won't think it's a slap on the wrist, but in the end it still will be very shallow punishment imo.\n\nNothing ever happens\n\nNothing happens at all\n\nNational League North üôè\n\nBe nice to see Man City come down to my local team King‚Äôs Lynn.\n\nUp the¬†Linnets!\n\nWhat a fucking small world. I live right by the ground\n\nHa. So do my parents where I used to live. Milton Ave\n\nAh by the crossing? Yeah I'm hospital end. Try go /and go over when I can like\n\nYeah that‚Äôs it. I don‚Äôt go too often now. The prices are ridiculous for Conference North\n\nA stern look from behind a closed door and a brisk' 'tsk' next time they meet.\n\na Paddingtonesque hard stare.\n\nThey're going to get away with it, aren't they\n\nYes.\n\nThanks to Man City‚Äôs contribution during the hearings the Premier League, FA, UEFA, and FIFA have decided to BAN Everton Football Club Effective Immediately\n\nNot an unexpected outcome\n\nExpect the unexpected\n\nI've had enough. 10 point deduction for Everton, 3 red cards for Arsenal, injury for reece James and an award for Messi.\n\nAn 10s time penalty for Ocon\n\nRed card for Bruno as well?\n\nSir Alex deported to Scotland.\n\nAnd a penalty for Real Madrid\n\nFalse offside for Liverpool\n\nPunishment should be having Kalvin Philips back as a starter, Ed Woodward running the club and ETH as the manager.\n\nCannot wait for the 8 million posts about the outcome from people that can barely read a whole tweet, let alone a whole written judgement.....\n\nSpeak English I can‚Äôt understand you !\n\n1 match with 40% reduced capacity and a 6 month probation\n\nHaaland will be banned from using his meditation celebration and Grealish will be forced to move from xs to s gameday shirt for 3 games.\n\nA scolding on the centre circle\n\nNot going to lie as a none city fan that's concerning,\n\nUnless there's unequivocal guilt( which I believe there is but I'm not a lawyer) city would absolutely appeal and drag this out.\n\nSuggestion to me is they'll get away with this\n\nGimme that 65 point deduction and watch betting sites go crazy into a frenzy.\n\nAs a City supporter, I'm looking forward to the evidence becoming public. Especially the evidence regarding the involvement of the auditors, who the PL accuses of being involved in a criminal conspiracy whilst simultaneously employing them to do its own accounts. Can't wait to hear their barrister explain that one.\n\nI'm assuming that the Premier League has amassed some incredibly damning evidence that is not a pile of selectively-leaked emails hacked by a man who has tried to extort money from a dozen different European clubs.\n\nBecause if that's all they've got, their case is doomed. CAS already went through this. Nevermind City being angry with the PL, imagine the reaction of all the other clubs if they learn the league dragged this whole thing on for years, assuring them at every stage that success was guaranteed, only to discover they never had any actual proof and have spent tens of millions of pounds on a hopeless case instead of pushing for real action and fundamentally rewriting the rules to ensure no club and no owner could ever do what City are accused of.\n\nIf City win this thing, the Premier League will have completely undermined itself as an organisation. Who could ever take them seriously again? How could this group of people be trusted to run the league when they so evidently worked against its members' interests?\n\nIf City are proven guilty, I think we should be expelled from the league, fined billions, and every individual involved banned from ever being involved in football again. The punishment has to be so severe that no one will try something like this again. It'll also mean a few people going to gaol, which would also serve a decent deterrent. As it is, I think the failure to cooperate charges will stick. The club hasn't been shy in refusing to hand over the requested paperwork.\n\nAs a city fan you need to stop the delusion that CAS already went through this, you obstructed them and the evidence was time barred, you never ever won that case.\n\nThe premier league don't have the same rules or procedures, which is why it took so long, and they don't care about how they received the evidence because you as a club deliberately didn't cooperate. You only really have yourselves to blame because an innocent party cooperates.\n\n\nAt the end of the day you have to start to recognise regardless of outcome that nobody innocent is charged 115 times and then refuses to cooperate.\n\nIt's such an annoying sleight of hand trick city fans use all the time by saying they were proven not guilty by CAS. They got through it on the scummiest of technicalities.\n\nCAS literally ruled that UEFA had failed to produce evidence proving the charges, and it wouldn't consider any suspected breaches outwith the allowed period. It was as straightforward a judgment as you can get. The only part it ruled against City on was failure to cooperate. \n\nDid UEFA prove their case? No. Are City innocent? Maybe not, but that's how the legal system works. Proving innocence isn't required. Proving guilt is.\n\nI honestly don't think they understand, which is absolutely fair, we're not all lawyers and their club is theirs, it's hard to see your side say we're innocent and still be like nah this is fishy.\n\n\nBut yeah, they do need to drop it because it's working on absolutely nobody\n\nAt this point they're kidding themselves. It's wilful ignorance\n\nIt‚Äòs not more wrong than saying City only escaped punishment because of time limitations.\n\nThere were charges within time limits that City were cleared of but everything outside black and white/win and lose is outside the comprehension of football fans it seems.\n\n&gt;you obstructed them\n\nYes, as I said in the comment you replied to.\n\n&gt;you never ever won that case.\n\nWe literally did.\n\n&gt;the evidence was time barred\n\nNo, **some** of the charges related to spending older than 5 seasons earlier, which UEFA's own rules say cannot be considered. CAS simply restated that, ruling that any charges earlier than 2014/15 wouldn't be considered by the court. The PL doesn't have the same rules, so those seasons are being considered by the independent panel. The evidence hasn't yet been tested. The charges relating to the period after 2015 were dismissed as unproven by CAS. They ruled that UEFA had failed to produce any evidence proving their case.\n\n&gt;an innocent party cooperates.\n\n&gt;nobody innocent is charged 115 times and then refuses to cooperate.\n\nExcept people do this every single day. City's argument is that the PL hasn't proved cause, so according to the league's own rules, the club can refuse to hand over sensitive records. It's up to the independent panel to decide whether or not the league had sufficient cause, and whether City were entitled to withhold certain information. This is the weakest part of City's defence.\n\n&gt;and they don't care about how they received the evidence\n\nOf course not, but if they're relying on evidence that has already been considered and dismissed by CAS, it greatly weakens their case. The burden of proof isn't identical, but it's not entirely dissimilar. Which is why I'm assuming the league has other, more convincing evidence that hasn't been released to the wider public yet.\n\nDude you've just admitted UEFAs rules about time are the reason they couldn't charge you, that doesn't mean you won the case. And yeah, they had no evidence because you refuse to cooperate.\n\nPeople don't do that every day buddy, if you were arrested for fraud, or worse, and you knew you'd done nothing you'd be helping in any way possible to clear your name.\n\nWhat you wouldn't be doing is deliberately muddying every avenue .\n\nOnce more, UEFAs rules saved you, you didn't win any case and CAS had to side with the rules being badly written. there's no such authority in the premier league so the very same evidence can slam you\n\nFor the sake of clarity I'll compare the CAS ruling to a criminal trial, as most people are more familiar with the concept.\n\nCAS ruled that the charges relating to the years 2015 to 2019 were unproven. UEFA presented its evidence, and the court ruled that it did not prove that any rules had been broken. That is known as an acquital, which is what happens when the case against someone isn't successful. You can be guilty or not guilty. In this instance, City were found not guilty.\n\nNot guilty = we won the case\n\nCAS ruled that the charges relating to the years 2014 and earlier could not be considered and that UEFA had broken its own rules in punishing breaches it suspected in those years. CAS refused to even look at the evidence for those years. It made no judgment on the merit of that part of the case.\n\nUEFA wrong, City right = we won the case\n\nCAS ruled that City has broken the rules in failing to cooperate. It imposed a fine of ~¬£9mn, reduced from ~¬£22mn initially set by UEFA.\n\nCity wrong, UEFA right = we lost that one \n\nIf I personally were charged with fraud, I would wait to see what evidence they had. If they had none, or evidence that was so weak or so tainted that my lawyers told me the case was certain to fail, I would keep quiet and not hand over anything I wasn't legally required to. My lawyers would argue that the documents the prosecution wanted to use sat outside the scope of its investigation and/or were commercially sensitive and exempt from outside oversight beyond the legal requirement. I would have my accounts audited by a professional firm and would present those accounts and the auditors analysis as evidence, which is exactly what City did.\n\nIt is up to the Premier League to prove that those auditors are deliberately lying and are part of the cover-up. It will make that argument whilst those very same auditors are going through the league's own accounts, because that's who the league hired to do so. \n\nI don't know how to make it any clearer. UEFA produced evidence and the court ruled that half of it wasn't relevant and the other half did not prove anything. That is a win for City. Which is why the PL must have more evidence. They're not only looking at the years 2009 to 2014. They're looking at everything up to 2018, meaning that the evidence UEFA had for 2015 to 2018 isn't enough to prove anything, thus the league must have something else that does.\n\nIf city win this thing we all know that won‚Äôt happen. And it shouldn‚Äôt.\n\nWhy would prison time come into this? It‚Äôs not a criminal investigation, it‚Äôs an independent panel assessing if City have broken arbitrary rules. HMRC would certainly become involved if it comes out that players or managers avoided tax, but beyond the ruling that all players had to go on PAYE quite a few years ago, there‚Äôs nothing for CPS to prosecute anyone over.¬†\n\nIt also raises the question that if City were paying ‚Äòdouble wages‚Äô via offshoring, why anyone would ever leave the club. Assuming all other teams follow the rules, nobody would ever move and gain the same level of income? Indeed, Mancini took a massive pay drop to go to Galatasaray, he could have leveraged City into a well paid ‚Äòupstairs job‚Äô if he had dirt on them¬†\n\nBecause CAS is a court, and perjury is a crime. If the PL can prove that the auditors lied, they'll be in a lot of trouble. \n\nIf the independent panel decides to punish based on their best guess, rather than definitive proof, City will win any appeal easily. The burden of proof is high for this very reason. Because the burden of proof is high, the league will be able to present clear evidence that executives at City lied in their evidence, as did the people from BDO who testified in court. That evidence would have to be handed over, and perjury is almost always punished with imprisonment.\n\nA very strong word condemnation and that's it, ala UN\n\nAn example needs to be made so that others even thinking about doing anything like this dont...otherwise all it will do is encourage others to push the limits\n\nMan City will be cleared. I honestly can't see any other outcome\n\nIf they are not they will probably just win the appeal anyway because lawyers\n\nThere's huge political pressure on the PL, the government has basically said that if they can't get their shit together they'll appoint a body to govern the league.\n\nWhat makes you say this? Any reasoning? Been trying to follow it but don't have the time to go through it all\n\nDon't take the opinions of redditors on court matters. Read ul yourself or wait for the outcome.\n\nThey couldn't get Leicester who had 100,000% done what they were accused of. No chance they'll get City\n\nThat‚Äôs because Leicester were bound by EFL rules and not the PL. There are details that matter\n\nUtter bullshit.\n\nLeicester committed 100% of the offence within the premier league. \n\nAnd what they did was miles worse than Forest and Everton\n\nPL had their pants pulled down on their own craply written rules\n\nAbsolutely no chance they get City\n\nNot utter bullshit. That‚Äôs what their lawyers fought on and won.\n\nIt was a bullshit loophole. They argued exactly the same to get out of it in the EFL. \n\nA loose bit of wording allowed a loophole \n\nLeicester 100% deserved a points deduction more than Everton and Forest. They got away with it on technicality because the PL were too incompetent to make their rules tight. \n\nYou really think they have a chance of getting city? You really think their rules are tight enough for their lawyers not to make mincemeat out of?\n\nFans of the top red teams should be in favor of joining the super league if city gets a slap on the wrist.  Those clubs already carry the rest of the clubs when it comes to tv money which is spread evenly, now they wont be able to compete with the bottomless pit of money of foreign governments who the UK government refuses to treat fairly over trade deals which have nothing to do with football. Given it won‚Äôt be a closed shop, with strict financial controls and more big games than the current model, fans should support it\n\nIf 'the red cartel' leaves the PL, they can try selling tv rights to a league that will have City and Newcastle on 111 points and 758 meaningless games.\n\nExactly\n\nI Will get the wet bus ticket ready\n\nJust deduct 1 point will do as a stern warning, the remaining points deduct from everton\n\nwith the condensed timeline, im expecting a limpwristed slap with a wet bus ticket.\n\n2 bob and a conker fine!\n\nThey're getting Joe Pesci'ed (Goodfellas)\n\nAnd then their lawyers will appeal and appeal until 1. The season ends 2. Their punishment is reduced to a token gesture..\n\nHahaahhahahahahahahahahhhaahhaha\n\nGood¬†\n\nTime for a wristy slappy!!\n\nThey just needed to wait for the bribes to clear.\n\nIt will be like with Rodri on the pitch, three verbal warnings before he's actually given a caution. That's why he's \"world class\".\n\nWe all know nothing will happen. City‚Äôs owners are going to pay the judges under the table and nothing will happen. And City and Newcastle will battle it out every year as the historically big clubs watch on.\n\nThe worst they would get due to who they are could include some or all of the following in my opinion:\n\n* point deduction (probably no more than 20)\n* no European comps for a year\n* would they be able to give a transfer ban to them (if so then id say a window maybe 2)\n* massive fine (well not for them)\n\nI can't see them being fined/punished more than this (if found guilty). Even if all of the above happens that will not affect them at all, they won't win the league one season and won't play in UCL one season and a couple of players like Haaland might leave but that's not anything crazy. In the end they will not change their ways.\n\nA ¬£10,000 fine, a tsk tsk, and a shame on you\n\nHang the dogs out to dry.\n\n-15 points to Everton\n\nFA wouldn't do any serious to Manchester City. They should get it over with.¬†\n\nNeverending story\n\nImagine they get relegated\n\nOne can only dream‚Ä¶¬†\n\nSlapped wrist and 10 points from Everton\n\nThey will slip them a $50 and get of scott free\n\nNot innoguiltycent!\n\nSome tutting and a disappointed look\n\n¬£200,000 fine\n\nThe punishment they should get is demotion from the football league and the stripping of multiple titles, if this panel does their job properly. The punishment they WILL get? Who knows.\n\nSpoiler: a fine and a miniscule points deduction.\n\nPLEASE FOOTBAL GODS... DO IT FOR THE BANTS IF NOT FOR JUSTICE...\n\n9 point deduction for Everton incoming\n\nSomehow it all turns into a red card for Tomiyasu.\n\nVERDICT: GUILTY!!!!\n\nPUNISHMENT: 20 dollar fine"

It will be running in billions too ü§ëü§ë\n\nMillions probably. Not billions.. üòÇüòÇüòÇ\n\nThis YouTuber (PedTalksSports) has made a good video on this.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/gwc1mFP-Cew?si=fsPia40KElA1Ptew\n\nDefinitely the goat social media influencer I'll give that\n\nYes, he's the real greatest of all time on social media. No one is close to him.¬†\n\nLegendary\n\nHalf of them are fake\n\nI think you underestimate the presence south Asians have on social media lol\n\n500 Million is not legendary. Got it.\n\nI can‚Äôt imagine the proportion of fake accounts following Messi or Taylor Swift is any different. Regardless of the absolute number, the relative dominance is still impressive.\n\nCope\n\nWhy would someone need to cope about a footballer having social media followers? Who gives a crap?\n\nYou‚Äôre getting downvoted but you‚Äôre  right. All the platforms are riddled with fake accounts/bots/alts etc.\n\nHow many are bots i wonder\n\nAn awful lot, very likely.\n\nThe entire planet has like 8bn people, and out of that about 2bn are younger than 14, so they shouldn‚Äôt really be on social media.\n\nThat leaves 6bn people ages 15 and up. So he is followed by 1 in 6 of the entire global population in that cohort.\n\nAnd then take into account that football isn‚Äôt even *that* popular in the largest countries like India and China. \n\nIndia has 1.3bn people, and two thirds are aged 15+, so that 6bn figure includes some 850m of Indians. China has 1.4bn, and 15+ account for like 1.16bn. \n\nSo out of those 6bn about a third are Indians and Chinese, who don‚Äôt really give a fuck about Ronaldo.\n\nThe entire rest of the world accounts for 4bn, so without China and India we are led to believe he is followed by 1 in 4 adults (everyone from teenagers to pensioners) outside of those two countries.\n\nGranted, the article says this is a combined figure, from YT, FB, IG and Xitter. But even if his unique followers followed him on three sites, on average, that would bring the number to 300m, which still sounds inflated due to bots.\n\nSince the numbers are so non-transparent, it‚Äôs kinda misleading to describe this as his number of ‚Äúfollowers‚Äù - it‚Äôs 100% certain that there isn‚Äôt a billion unique humans following him.\n\nMaybe you might say he has the largest ‚Äúsocial media footprint‚Äù or something to that effect. But ‚Äúfollowers‚Äù? No.\n\nThis is basically just the number he can quote when signing sponsorship deals. The real question is whether marketing agencies buy that number.\n\nnah you are under estimating football fans from india and china, there are a lot of em but just dont have good teams on a professional level\n\nYou're not taking into account that the 1bn is the sum of his followers over multiple platforms. Which would mean that 1 person following on 4 different platforms would count as 4 followers in the total. I still believe your point is true to a degree but this is one part you haven't considered.\n\nThanks, I edited my comment to add that in. IMO even 250m would probably be an inflated figure if you are interested in finding out how many humans are actually following him.\n\njust look in the comment sections, a lot of indians most of the time, also alot of africans a lot of the time. Look at how many people live alone in India, and then sum up some african countries. you get awhole lot of people\n\nNot denying bots but:\n\nSocial media followers are not just individuals. There are all sorts of brands from around the world involved. From garage podcasts to fortune 100 companies. Not to mention inactive users and alt accounts. Those are not bots.\n\nSaying that children 14 and below aren't on social media is just so wrong, basically everyone today starts being on social media much before that.\n\nAlso the full negligence for India and China is also very wrong, with this amount of population we (yeah I'm Indian) do account for a decent amount of his followers I think\n\nfound Messi fan / Argentine\n\nnot to mention major social media outlets are blocked in china, although I know there are ways around the firewall\n\nThey accounted for two Chinese social media networks too.\n\nYou don't need to be a football fan to follow Cristiano you know. Many Indians and Chinese follow Cristiano on every platform. I am a fan yet I don't follow him or any other celebrity online at all. So you can't really generalise it.\n\nIf you are going to present a thesis, it helps to be factual.\n\nThis is a terrible analysis. No offense\n\nLmao you‚Äôre being downvoted but it‚Äôs the truth. Ronaldo likely has hundreds of millions of bot followers. People like to take the WC/Football‚Äôs global popularity (hundreds of national organizations) and attribute it to individual soccer players, which is ridiculous. Ronaldo is not as famous as football, and even the WC doesn‚Äôt command global attention like that. The WC final gets like 1.5 billion _1 minute viewers_ - people watching for 1 minute! That‚Äôs just scrolling through TV at that point. And the WC is obviously more famous and engaging than Ronaldo.\n\nChina‚Äôs most watched soccer matches are those with Chinese players. Ronaldo is not commanding tens to hundreds of millions of viewers there.\n\nI wish football fans would realize 1) not everyone cares about sports, much less football and 2) no athlete is as popular as the global sport. Ronaldo having a billion followers is rather vacuous, especially considering the hundreds of millions of bots and duplicate accounts there.\n\nFirst rapist to hit 1 billion followers\n\nEnvy.\n\nInstigation.\n\nAnything to get peoples attention.\n\nKarma is just around your corner.\n\nsocial media influencer d'or\n\nGOAT media whore.\n\nCristiano Ronaldo is the GOAT of social media platforms. He's a big sensation.¬†\n\nI'm going to get downvoted for this but, that too will prove the extent of the problem I'm talking about here.\n\nHow this man got away with raping a woman surprises me. No brands cut ties with him. Barely anyone even talks about it. The allegations even came out at the height of the me too movement.\n\nAnd the facts don't look good for him.\n\n- The deposition that Der Spiegel had where he admits \"she said no several times.\" Never sued Der Spiegel for libel either.\n\n- He did not win his court case but managed to get it dismissed due to the technicality that the evidence was from a leak. Although football leaks had all been accurate in the past.\n\n- He had paid her a settlement which raises the chances that one party is guilty and wishes to avoid scrutiny.\n\nGreat football player. But it just goes to show you, sometimes you can have so much power that you could get away with anything.\n\nHe‚Äôs rich and good at a sport. So it‚Äôs ok.\n\nWhy would you get downvoted for saying something negative about Ronaldo? You're already starting off pandering but good on you. I'm actually going to get downvoted for this though.\n\nEvery single point you made all the conclusions you came to were assumptive in nature. \n\nWhy was the entire case built upon the 1 single \"leak\" of evidence? It's not like the case got thrown out based on the leak. That just means they had literally no other even remotely sound evidence outside of a leaked conversation, which is not a confession no matter how much you want it to be. \n\nThe appeal was then denied again by continued improper procedure by Mayorga and her counsel. If they really had a strong case the most basic things they would have done correctly would be following the proper guidelines they were well aware of.\n\nShe was with him and hanging in him all night then obliged to go back up to the hotel room with him all on her own. If all she wanted to do was go to sleep she could have gone to her own hotel room, she knew exactly what was happening.\n\nShe said no a few times and then specifically made herself available there in consenting. Verbal consent isn't the only form of consent and you can actually consent after previously not consenting. \n\nNothing outcome of this case was based on who Ronaldo is but entirely on Mayorga and her attorney.\n\nBut she said no more than once?! Then you should stop! Who the fuck wants to fuck someone who clearly doesn‚Äôt want to fuck?? And it was anal! And It‚Äôs not consent just because she goes on and let him, it can be dangerous otherwise when she realizes he is not listening and the first couple of no‚Äôs. AND he apologizes afterwards? Like wtf. He is fucked up. Period.\n\nThat leak was not the only piece of evidence but part of the evidence and a major one.  If that was admissible in court, he most likely would‚Äôve been found guilty.  And many women go hang out with guys and go back to their place, doesn‚Äôt mean they want to have sex. Saying no a few times is serious enough. On top of that, the findings at the hospital was consistent with rape and throw in the settlement.\n\nWhat other evidence did they have? Besides everything that was already admitted? None of what you said is held up in court because it's all assumptive in nature. Please source where the hospital findings were consistent with actual rape with the professional examiner attesting to it. \n\nShould Ronaldo have done it?  Obviously not. \n\nDid she want to? No. \n\nDid she still consent to it anyway? Yes.\n\nI found some articles online, so you can try looking at different sources. They talk about her hospital, police visit and rape kit test.\n\nI read various articles. All they said was the rape kit proved Ronaldo's DNA, which again was never in dispute. They alleged anal penetration without preparation which could or could not be consistent with rape. None of that is conclusive enough to prove beyond doubt and is all assumptive in nature.\n\nEdit: \n\n\"Las Vegas police reopened a rape investigation after Mayorga‚Äôs lawsuit was filed in 2018, but Clark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson decided in 2019 not to pursue criminal charges. He said too much time had passed and evidence failed to show that Mayorga‚Äôs accusation could be proved to a jury.\" \n\nhttps://apnews.com/article/ronaldo-rape-lawsuit-vegas-appeal-soccer-935996e981e80c5d44c61c6a7f905689\n\nCorrect me on the following if I'm wrong. I mean this in good faith.\n\n1 - I believe her lawyers sought additional proof. A key way in which was to compare Ronaldo's DNA with her rape kit. There were reports he avoiding going to the states to avoid being subpoenaed to provide his DNA. There were also rumors that Juventus changed their pre-season plans from touring in the states to facilitate this.\n\n2 - More recently, under the freedom of information act, the new York times were trying to investigate the leaked deposition, however now from official channel. Ronaldo's lawyers legally combatted this to an adversarial extent.\n\n3 - Ronaldo also displayed a typical SA perpetrator's attitude when these allegations first came to light. He pretended he didn't know who Kathryn mayorga was until picture evidence was revealed and he admitted they had had sex but it was consensual.\n\n4 - Kathryn Mayorga also did something that typically women with legitimate SA experiences do - she sought a rape kit examination the very next day. Followed by therapy. And she kept Ronaldo's name to her self for fear of retribution.\n\n5 - Der Spiegel has an incredibly high standard of reporting. They're basically the New York Times of Germany. They did publish the leaked deposition as true. Similarly, the organisation \"Football Leaks\" has never been proven false in any of their reports.\n\n6 - According to the reports, it was forced Anal. She did not make herself available non verbally. Post which Ronaldo is reported as saying he is clean because for his sport he needs to remain clean. \n\nAs I said, I am stating this in good faith not as gotchas. If anything I've read about this is wrong, please feel free to fact check me.\n\nThanks.\n\n1. It wouldn't matter because the dispute wasn't that they had sex, it's whether it was consensual. Not sure what the Juve point would argue it makes sense for them to do that though.\n\n2. New York times were trying to use \"journalism\" to launch their own investigation. Why would Ronaldo's team change their stance at all for sake of humoring the New York times?  Again if they had other actual evidence they would have presented it and they wouldn't have needed to be so careless in handling the evidence they did have. Twice because again they filed for appeal and it was dismissed. \n\n3. Visual analysis of attitude isn't an argument \n\n4. She also did something that would make sense to do if she was lying. The rape kit doesn't prove rape, it aims to provide some sort of sexual intercourse took place. Which again, Ronaldo's team never denied. They are denying it was not consensual. \n\n5. Even if the leak was true it again proves no rape. She was again. With him all night, free to leave when she wanted. Voluntarily goes up with him to the hotel room. Says no and then nonverbally consents to anal. \n\nI'm acting in good faith as well and I appreciate you having this difficult conversation and still being able to remain civil with each other.\n\nCheers\n\nI'd like to maintain civility as well and I thank you for maintaining this with me :) Just because we're on opposing sides here does not mean we need to be assholes. Anyway, let's continue:\n\n1) Would you say it was Sus he denied the allegations as fake news before pictures revealed him with her? After those pictures he states that they did have sex but it was consensual.\n\n2) You are correct. Whether I am guilty or I am not guilty, I personally would make sure my lawyers combat any newspaper trying to investigate my life. However, when I compare his attitude towards New York Times Vs his attitude towards Der Spiegel, this is where I find it Sus. Der Spiegel literally published something inadmissible in court - a leaked document. Had Ronaldo sued them for libel, that would have led the document being investigated through official channels. Hence, his lawyers did not touch Der Spiegel with a ten foot pool. We can argue steisand effect here but, I find myself comparing this situation with Neymars. Neymar was also libeled. He took legal action against the papers in his case. I understand this is speculation but, when I compare his timidity to Der Spiegel Vs the new York times when they are about to make the document official, I find it Sus. \n\n3) My attempt is not to argue. Argument-wise this is a closed situation. That court case was dismissed. But if we are trying to be intelligent people and deduce from the known facts, he looks very guilty (correct me if you feel otherwise). The intent of my OG comment was, despite these known facts that make him appear very guilty (IMO), most people are totally unaware of them or know a wrong version of them (many people believe he won his court case rather than the case being dismissed on a technicality. The evidence Mayorga's lawyers were trying to use was sourced from Football Leaks - an organisation that, although has a truthful record, cannot be used for evidence due to leaks being fundamentally open to fabrication.\n\n4) Would you kindly clarify what you were referring to when you said \"she did something that would make sense to do if she was lying.\" According to what I know, her conduct in this whole affair is not one I would identify as malicious. Initially, she did not even want to reveal his name during the 2009-2010 investigation for fear of retaliation. He was the biggest footballer at the time, having joined Real Madrid on the highest transfer fee at the time.\n\n5) I think this is where I have to respectfully tell you your facts are wrong. From what I remember reading (this is from the Der Spiegel article), it was an after party. His hotel room had a pool. She went to a room to change into a swimsuit. He entered her room without her consent. And then the anal sex happened. She left soon afterwards, soon after his profuse apologies. Now, here's where I have to be a little graphic for the sake of clarity: \nIf you're trying to trap someone via anal sex, you have to either be a masochist to do this on the spot without any um \"prior preparation of the orifice.\" \nOr,\ndiabolically plan this before hand and so be prepared.\nHer rape kit revealed injuries in that region. If it was consensual, there shouldn't be those sorts of injuries. Unless you're a masochist. Those sorts of injuries in that sort of intercourse basically means either forced or consented force. I feel deeply uncomfortable talking about this so, make of that what you will. \n\nI hope I've made sense and look forward to your thoughts.\n\nWe are on the same side when it comes to rape. If Ronaldo did actually forcefully rape her against her will then he should absolutely be punished and held accountable accordingly. He would no longer hold any revere to me as a player or person. \n\nI just don't think he did it. \n\n\n1.  I can't say I would pretend to know what it's like to be in this situation. If a girl I had consensual sex with then accused me of rape. I'm denying it and breathing no more life into the accusation. \n\n2. The Neymar case isn't similar to Ronaldo's. It was a newspaper article with literally no evidence to corroborate. Why would anyone in any case fight for evidence against them to be presented. Again, the prosecution had 2 attempts to go through proper procedures and failed to do so. If the case and argument was valid they would have avoided screwing up such a high profile case at any cost. \n\n3. Most people at least on Reddit are in agreement with you regardless of the information you presented, most of which I believe is known for anyone that's remotely followed this \n\n4. Both parties in my opinion did exactly what they would if they were lying or if they were telling the truth.  \n\n5. You skip over the critical part in the story. He entered her room non-consenuslly then proceeded to forcibly anally rape her? Not arguing they didn't she didn't plan to have anal sex that night and thus didn't prepare. I'm arguing she didn't want to, wanted regular sex, which Ronaldo didn't want and she eventually opted to say yes.   When in the investigation does she state she asked Ronaldo to leave her room when entered right then or at any point after?\n\n1- I think we can agree to disagree here. In my view, it seems incredibly suspicious that someone denies knowing you, calls it fake news, until pictures reveal you with them. At which point you completely remember having intercourse with them. Notably consensually. It's incredibly suspicious you avoid traveling to a country and cause your employers to cancel their commitments to that country, lest you be legally required to provide evidence that corroborates a rape kit.\n\n2 - \"why would anyone in any case fight for evidence to be presented against them\" - Case in point, Johnny Depp. Libel is a serious crime. If a reputable newspaper prints lies about your reputation, you should sue them. People do sue newspapers for libel. Just as Johnny Depp did with The Sun. Just as Neymar did. And if, as you suggest the situation was with Neymar, the papers don't have much proof, then Ronaldo should have no problem suing for libel. We're talking about a 27 page deposition questionnaire. If he knew he came across as making the intercourse consensual, he would sue for libel. \n\nWe can agree to disagree here as well - in my view I'm seeing his extremely litigious attitude towards The New York Times Freedom of information search, compared to his timidity towards Der Spiegel, (and Der Spiegel is a publication that actually printed quotes from a legally inadmissable leaked document) to be in variance only due to one thing - do not make that deposition legally official. \n\nIt's from Football Leaks today and they've never lied but at least it's not official. Threaten to sue NYT if it keeps it unofficial. And be as quiet as a Buddhist cow towards Der Spiegel if it keeps it unofficial. Just keep it legally unofficial.\n\nIt's a 27 page questionnaire. Something that led to his lawyers first offering the settlement in 2009. I speculate it's clear through this document that it wasn't consensual which is why they chose to settle initially. Which is why they'll be litigious or quiet as long as the document remains legally unofficial and unavailable.  \n\n3 - I don't know about Reddit but, I speculate the majority of football fans have no clue about any of this. And if they do, they mistakenly believe he won a court case.\n\n4 - Are you suggesting she eventually opted to say yes to unprepared Anal sex? Okay. I have to tell you, the likelihood of a woman doing that is very very low. Preparation is necessary in that situation. And if she did eventually opt to go ahead with anal, that would make her a very unique masochist. \n\nAnd if you are saying (and I really hope you are not) that she agreed to unprepared Anal because he is Ronaldo, then you are saying basically the same thing I have heard (and I'm sure you have with regards to other men),\n\n\"He's a celebrity. He can fuck whoever. Why would he have to rape? People would even do unprepared Anal with him.\"\n\nNo one's going to do anal unprepared. Doesn't matter who you are. The lesions reported in her rape kit, that's only possible consensually if she is a masochist. And again, we can agree to disagree here, but I don't think any woman is going to want those lesions, those injuries, consensually. \n\nLook, nothing was proven in a court. But nothing was disproven in a court due to a technicality. Her lawyers couldn't make the deposition legal (I think they had to pay him legal fees due to losing the appeal to reopen the case). \n\nBut, in my opinion, his behaviour makes him appear guilty.\n\nLook I think we've argued our points pretty succinctly. Not that I couldn't but don't really have an interest in an endless debate.\n\nHe's having a hard time keeping his hate up knowing the facts so he keeps regurgitating his opinions which in itself sound very childish, trying to pose them as facts and arguing with them as his basis. I'm surprised you entertained him this long, he's not here to learn.\n\nNah I've gotta respect the conversation. Given the topic it is never this civil and I really appreciate it regardless.\n\nWild seeing two bot accounts debating each other\n\nThis is why courts exist, it is for them to make such judgements based on the law, not us.\n\nCourts, famously not influenced by having lots and lots of money.\n\nThen suggest what else we should do to fight lawsuits Mr. Albert Fucking Einstein\n\nI mean he literally confessed, but because the recording of the confession was obtained illegally it was inadmissible and lead to the whole thing stopping.\n\nUnless you are capable of forming your own opinions and not relying on others\n\nForming your own opinion based on \"leaked\" documents which isn't even admissible in court? Wow\n\nI would like to point out for the sake of thoroughness - in the case of Man City, everyone has also made up their mind regarding their financial chicanery. The evidentiary source for such chicanery is also the organisation 'Football Leaks.'\nFootball leaks thus far has not been deemed inaccurate.\n\nMan city's case and ronaldos case aren't even comparable lmao\n\nI'm talking about the evidentiary source. Both the deposition where he admits \"she said no several times\" and man city's sponsorship Vs revenue irregularities are football leaks. Man city has also not been proven guilty regarding their 115 charges. But everyone has made up their mind regarding this due to football leaks being (thus far) accurate. I hope you're seeing the point I'm making here\n\nYes... If the source where that came from has a whole list of things that were proven true and not a single one that was proven untrue, absolutely it is enough to form an opinion on.\n\nYou're delusional if you think that with so much football leaks was spot on but this one thing, surely it must be fake... \n\nCourts are bound by important rules, but these rules also help people abuse them. Just because something was obtained the wrong way, doesn't make it untrue. A court has to dismiss that, any normal thinking person doesn't because the information is out there.\n\nI can form opinions on many things from a wide variety of sources as it happens.\n\nAnd guess what, I never think about whether some court on the other side of the world would rule about allowing it in their cases or not.\n\nAnd that's fine. But that doesn't mean you're right\n\nNever said it did!\n\nBut not being proven in a court of law doesn't mean someone didn't do something illegal either is my point\n\nTrue. But the original argument is that Ronaldo not facing any consequences is wrong. Face consequences for something which isn't proven to be true?\n\nI agree with that but I wasn't really focused on the \"how he got away with rape\" bit of the comment so I should clarify:\n\n1. I don't agree that he should face actual consequences given he hasn't been found guilty\n\n2. Having said that, given the belief I have that he actually did something wrong, I'm surprised that he had more followers than anyone else on earth. I would have assumed that others also think he's done something dodgy and would stay away. If you told me Taylor Swift was the most followed celebrity, or Virat Kohli was the most followed sportsman, I'd have believed that more readily as I don't associate either with that sort of controversy\n\nIf you are forming your own opinions based on information that is inadmissible in court then you are an idiot. Everything else is he said she said in these SA cases.\n\n&gt;If you are forming your own opinions based on information that is inadmissible in court then you are an idiot.\n\nWhy? I'm not limited by the same proof burdens or information embargoes as a court on the other side of the world\n\nBecause you literally said it in your answer, you are forming opinions based on non proven information. The burden of proof of a court is what anyone sensible would need, it doesnt even need to be 100%, beyond reasonable doubt is enough and they cant even do that.\n\n&gt;The burden of proof of a court is what anyone sensible would need, it doesnt even need to be 100%, beyond reasonable doubt is enough and they cant even do that.\n\nIf you're telling me that you believe 100% of people who have ever done something illegal have had that proven in a court of law then it makes sense that you would have this silly take on things\n\nI however am less na√Øve than that\n\nSo OJ didn‚Äôt kill his wife then?\n\n[removed]\n\nNice straw man but I didn‚Äôt say anything about abandoning the justice system lmao \n\nThe point is someone not being convicted in court doesn‚Äôt always equate to them not having done what they were accused of. But you probably already knew that when you made your irrelevant argument.\n\nYou realize innocent people rot away in prison for crimes they didn‚Äôt do, it happens often. Do you really think there‚Äôs no difference in outcome between the rich and powerful in court and average people??üòÇüòÇ\n\nThis is it, a lot of people still believe she intentionally got with him and had a plan, that shed be coy about it and say no before agreeing to and having sex with him and then getting a decent pay packet out of it.\n\n\nNow when you dig a bit into her as a person and what she's like you kind of go, yea I can see that being a thing.\n\n\nTruth is no one knows and they settled so no one will ever know.\n\nHe got off on a technicality bruv\n\nGreenwood disagrees\n\nOk very very different I know, but he wasn‚Äôt convicted either yet everyone still knows and is disgusted by what he did.\n\nI mean he literally confessed, but because the confession was obtained illegally it was inadmissible and lead to the whole thing stopping.\n\nYes that is generally why illegally obtained confessions are inadmissible, anything could be involved to force a confession.. psychological / physical torture, coercion, blackmail, threats etc... \n\nHave you seen some of the things crooked cops do to suspects to force people to confess to things that they didnt even do?\n\nYes, when the confession was a recording of a conversation between him and his lawyer however we can use that to inform our opinions on him, even if the courts aren‚Äôt doing anything. Tell me what are your thoughts on greenwood?\n\nThat I know a hell of a lot less about what actually happened that night than both people involved and she had a kid with him and married him afterwards so who knows.\n\nHe probably did knock her around, and ronaldo probably did rape that woman but if the courts havent proven it, it should have literally 0 impact on their lives.\n\nThis is laughableüòÇ\n\nAhh. Dont think Giggs (sleeping with his brothers wife) or Greenwood was ever convicted. Still doesnt change the fact that they're assholes. Kinda same applies to Ronaldo.¬†\n\nI mean he literally confessed, but because the confession was obtained illegally it was inadmissible and lead to the whole thing stopping.\n\nWhat so greenwood is innocent?\n\nIn the eyes of the law, yes. How is that even a question... if he wasnt he would be in jail.\n\nWho gives a fuck about the eyes of the law? We all know he‚Äôs guilty, the point is that the eyes of the law ain‚Äôt always great.\n\nRefer to my original comment, they have all of the information, we dont.\n\nFuck the court of public opinion, its ruined countless lives especially in these days of social media.\n\nStop making shit up he never got convicted or anything else. Made up American bullshit\n\nThe most uninformed people in this whole situation are people like you &amp; me. We both don‚Äôt have the facts nor the evidence to reliably say what is true or not true. \n\nThe case with Greenwood was very clear because the evidence was released into public so it‚Äôs very hard to defend him. \n\nNot here though so stop creating fake stories in your head and posting them online as concrete evidence or for the sake of having a ‚Äúunique and different‚Äù take.\n\n[deleted]\n\nIt‚Äôs seems that way to people who think they have all the evidence from a couple of tabloid articles. I don‚Äôt like jumping to conclusions without the full picture. But feel free to do whatever you want man, it‚Äôs your life.\n\n[deleted]\n\nBuffon. I know a good number of people think Neuer is better but I think Buffon is the GOAT. Who is your favourite?\n\nWell I suppose the issue is that you have to believe someone (or a group of people)who are immoral and technically skilled enough to hack a law firm's classified information, would never do something like editing those documents. Basically you have to trust criminals to not behave as criminals, now you might say it's unlikely but it's far from impossible\n\nThe source is the organisation known as \"Football Leaks.\" Their investigative leaks in the past (especially concerning financial irregularities related to Manchester City) have been used to legally and formally investigate other crimes and come out to be 100% true. I think the UEFA case that charged Man City also sourced Football Leak's investigation. Also, Der Spiegel (known as the New York Times of Germany) used the leak deposition document to publish the \"she said no several times\" story. Der Spiegel never received a cease and desist or a libel threat.\n\nYou can't use lack of lawsuit as evidence. You never heard of the Streisand effect?\n\nI get what you're saying. Maybe that's why lots of people don't know about this or assume he won his court case and was proven innocent. I keep thinking back to Neymar where he was in a similar situation and he did sue for libel and won. However, I get your point. Why draw attention to something?\n\nChrist almighty.\n\nMy guy there were videos of her rubbing her hands all over him. Of course that doesn't mean he didn't rape her, but The article you cited has holes in it.¬†\n\n\nAlso, how many famous athletes get accused of rape?¬†\n\nWould you kindly link these videos? I would also argue, there aren't that many famous athletes with a 27 page questionnaire deposition, that quotes the athlete saying \"she said no several times\" and that is leaked from an organisation (football leaks) that has a track record of not being wrong.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/PNLGgHmh3oI?si=RubhSUYHyV3QSOU3\n\n\nI'm not sure about der speigal and again I'm not saying he didn't rape her but Dee speigal has a history of making clickbait articles¬†\n\nI am so surprised I have never seen this before. Thanks. From what I know, she worked as a model for the establishment they were dancing at. Meaning she was meant to dance with the guests, make them spend money, etc etc. That also does not mean it was just a job. Regarding Der Spiegel, from what I know, they're regarded as a trust worthy paper in Germany. Also, the basis for everything is actually the leaked deposition that his lawyers conducted with him. Post which they offered her a settlement (speculation - because the deposition made him read guilty)\n\nYou're crying about a guy not losing anything for being accused of rape? The case was closed for a reason\n\nWho cares, famous people have done worse and got away with it.\n\nThe guy is saying the truth , I was the woman\n\nPlease don't make a joke about something like this\n\nI'll play devil's advocate for a minute:\nThere is a comedian that puts it nicely, there's multiple ways to say \"no\".\nSaying \" oh you ... No ... Oh stop it *blushes*\" and there's \" please stop, no. I'm not okay wtiht this\". These two, even while reading , the way i read will make you interpret in different ways.  Clearly the woman felt bad after the fact, was willing to make noise and a settlement was agreed on. She only resurfaced when the high on the metoo movement and my assessment could be that she took the opportunity to get more from someone who became a much bigger celebrity.\nNow to say this was a clear rape, I'm not sure and not the one to judge, as far as criminally goes, he didn't do anything wrong and now is just a hunt for the witch\n\nShe underwent a rape kit the very next morning. Refused to reveal the person's name because she was afraid of his influence. Was verifiably in therapy after the incident.\n\nlol. It‚Äôs combined. Who cares in the first place but adding up all his socials to make a big numbers, when most prob follow him on all of them.\n\nThis guy could say anything and make the world follow. He is a driving force and should put his powers to good use.\n\nA billion people are following a rapist.\n\nIdiots\n\nAnd he‚Äôs still a wanker\n\nNon story.\n\nSunday the king crashes Meta‚Äôs servers\n\nAs a football player he is a great influencer.\n\nLegend broke all the records if remaining he will broke all those too.\n\nHis ratio of followers to how interesting and entertaining his content is, is a casam.\n\nPeninfluencer\n\n1 billion?! Man, Ronaldo keeps winning both on and off the field. The dude's got the whole world following him, literally.\n\nWhich is a weird achievement if you think about it, since is mostly the same people following him across all platforms, not a billion different individuals. Not undermining his reach, its just odd.\n\nElon Musk seething as he huffs copium\n\nooh yaa expected from CR 7\n\nThat is crazy and I dont even follow him.\n\nNo he didn't. Imagine the overlap with the same people following on all of his social media. Those billion are not unique.\n\nBrainless sheeps.\n\nObviously loads are bots but how can hundreds of millions of people care what he has to say? Very odd.\n\nIndians are 90% of the followers\n\nAfter his football career his new journey is ready as a influencer marketer. :)\n\ngreatest player and 2nd best player\n\nWait, what?\n\nHe‚Äôs saying the greatest and best are different things, tho I do think Messi is probably the greater footballer anyways but Ronaldo does probably have more global influence but like if you know one you definetly know the second one\n\n[deleted]\n\nTalking as if Messi doesn't work hard. To be at that stage he also has to work as hard as Ronaldo. Everything just doesn't come with birth. It's just discrediting him and his hard work. Think about his physical disadvantage over Ronaldo and other footballers, only hard work can help you overcome that.\n\nBoth worked hard and both worked were super talented, yeh maybe Ronaldo worked harder but that doesn‚Äôt mean Messi didn‚Äôt put effort into things like his free kicks, messi definetly had more talent but he could have squandered it to not reach such heights like Neymar or hazard\n\nThink about it...\n\nBro he is the best goalscorer but not even close when we talk about complete footballer, top 3 are messi, pele and maradona\n\nTell me you never watched Ronaldo.\n\n901 goals and 0 in 5 wc ko are the clear proof.\n\nReally that‚Äôs your only argument??\n\nGive me something smart. I‚Äôll wait, covid kid.\n\n&gt;I‚Äôll wait, covid kid.\n\nThe irony of saying this while very likely being under 18 lol\n You the kid dawg üò≠\n\nWhat else do u need? the WC is the most important tournament, if u are not relevant there u cant be among the best\n\nWere you alive when Pele and Maradona played?\n\nThats why videocameras were made bro, chill\n\nRonaldo was more complete then either of them at their peak.\n\n\nPele couldn't play on the wing like ronaldo\n\nHe doesn't follow records, records follow him (except football records).\n\nBBC *news*? How is this news? Perhaps I should be grateful there's not more atrocities to report. But the fact that there's someone (people?) watching and waiting to add up the social media followers of one individual, then decide that it's *news*, is mental to me. Maybe 1 billion on a single platform would be noteworthy, but across all global social medias? Who's ever going to use this information other than in a really shit pub quiz?\n\nI feel sorry for anybody who actually cares about this\n\nTbf being able to reach 1/8 people with a message is kind of more important than a football result and I really love football\n\nRonaldo has no good message tho. He's plastic. Great footballer but 95% of these guys are idiots lol at least some of them are positive influences but Ronaldo js seems like another asshole\n\nAt least he is the best at something now.\n\n[removed]\n\n*2nd best\n\n1. Messi 2. Pele 3. Maradona. World Cup flop isn‚Äôt even in the conversation\n\nWait until 1B people Google ‚ÄúRonaldo Las Vegas‚Äù\nSiuuuu\n\nFootball fans when Benzema 15 üòä\n\nFootball fans when Ronaldo Las Vegas üò®üò®üò°\n\nWithout bots that's got to be at least 46\n\n46 billion\n\nStill 0 world cup knock out goals.\n\nEdit: also, still 0 world cup knock out assists.\n\nHe would have had many if he was playing for a top team like messi is\n\nThat's a shitty excuse considering the quality that portugal has lol.\n\nGtfo.\n\nThe quality that Portugal has when he's 38? Good logic mate. Look how shit messi was in the copa America this year. Having a good team when you're way past your prime means fuck all. Messi was lucky to get it when he still had it.\n\nMessi was playing injured in this Copa.\n\nPortugal was ranked higher than Argentina before both 2018 and 2014 world cup.\n\nAlso, funny how you cr7 fans make excuses for Ronaldo when he loses, but the troll Messi for his loses when Barca had a shitty unbalanced squad.\n\nKarma served you guys right in the past few years.\n\n&gt;troll Messi for his loses when Barca had a shitty unbalanced squad\n\nQu√©?\n\nHow many titles have you sir?\n\nNone.\n\nI also never raped anyone in my entire life.\n\nNeither has he.\n\nI'll take Ronaldo's words over yours.\n\nWhat from a shitty german source? Seriously?\n\n‚ÄúA leaked confession with his lawyers‚Äù posted by some german cunts. \n\nDon‚Äôt believe anything you read on the internet, kid.\n\nOk, kid.\n\nGo the fuck away.\n\nThat‚Äôs all you got?\n\nYes.\n\nNow, gtfo.\n\nWho say so?\n\nLess goal contributions in KO stages than Neuer somehow...\n\nGive him the Social Media d'Or\n\nMessi will steal it.\n\nDamn can't even win that either. Bro is cookedüò≠\n\nSo one in eight people in the world follow him somewhere ? I don't think so....must be a lot of bots involved also...\n\nIt‚Äôs combined across all of the major social media platforms, so yeah it‚Äôs not 1 billion individuals it‚Äôs 1 billion accounts, pretty meaningless"

More than ever, hour after hour, their work is never over.\n\nMidfielders too. A number 10 used to be able to pick up the ball in midfield, beat one man and open up a chance. Nowadays, the entire midfield will close in quickly, making it much harder\n\nSomeone forgot to tell Italy about this.\n\nAnd England\n\nAnd basically any team with good defences in the past\n\nAll the good strikers are on shit NTs. Haaland, Gyokeres, Osimhen\n\nNigeria in fact has too many 9s and forwards in general\n\nThey are genuinely so fun to watch because of this. Imagine a Nigerian squad with just a bit more of a steadfast traditional defensive training and ideology and you have a potential monster of a program.\n\nImagine a Scandinavia NT- Isak and Haaland up front with Odegaard behind them....\n\nI wouldn‚Äôt say Nigeria has a shit national team tbf, they just have structural issues. If you look at the Nigerian attack, they‚Äôve got some of the best young attackers playing in Europe this past season. Lookman (Europa league final hat trick scorer), Boniface (Rookie of the year Bundesliga) Osimhen‚Ä¶. With a good coach and proper structure, that attack will score tons of goals. In defence they‚Äôve got Bassey of Fulham as well and that lad is a tank tbf\n\nAnd Norway has 2 of the best players in the world in their starting 11 and can‚Äôt even qualify for a tournament. It‚Äôs about more than a few players.\n\nDidn't stop Wales getting to three tournaments with only Bale and Ramsey\n\nBale is a god that‚Äôs why\n\nI didn‚Äôt say it was about a few players, I simply said the Nigerian national team isn‚Äôt shit, their problems are structural because in terms of talent they‚Äôve got it all around the pitch (I mentioned 4 players as an example). I know about the team quite well because I followed them, Cote D‚Äôivore, Senegal and Egypt closely during the AFCON tournament. In midfield they had Iwobi, Ndidi et al, I wouldn‚Äôt call that a shit NT. If they managed to get a proper coach who actually understands football, instead of the idiot they get as coaches, we genuinely could see one of the best African teams we‚Äôve ever watched and what Morocco did at the World Cup would be nothing compared to how far they‚Äôd go.\n\nThey're unbalanced, all of their stars are forwards\n\nIf I could invest in national programs, I would sell my car banking on Nigeria. Just a little bit more consistency and structure as a program, a focus on allocating a shred of their top talent to defence, and they're a powerhouse. They're so close.\n\nIt‚Äôs a direct response to how football evolved with those great sides from towards the end of the 00s decade. False 9s, front 3s that interchanged etc led to the typical no9 not being something youth teams used. \n\nAlso, the size and strength a typical no9 required tends to come a little later in development/aging for how young players are around first teams now\n\nArgentina have both Lautaro and Alvarez, those greedy lads should at least sell one.\n\nNone of them are traditional 9s, the lack of which this post is bemoaning.\n\nLautaro is definitely a traditional 9, Julian maybe less so.\n\nYeah I can't really think of teams with a reliable number 9, even big time players like Real madrid, psg are struggling with a lack of number 9.\n\nBayern Munich have a pretty good number 9.\n\nComes with a curse though\n\nDoesnt City have a good number 9?\n\nNo they have a good 115. Oops soryy wrong sub\n\nyou didnt even try to hit a punchline üò≠\n\nr/soccercirclejerk leaked there\n\nNo they have a tap-in merchant /s\n\nNo place in this sport for someone who only scores goal. Useless.\n\nAnd there is haaland who is in Norway. Lol\n\nHonestly, there is a striker crisis. Kane is the best out there with both vision and clinical finish\n\nArgentina has two\n\nReal Madrid, most recent champions league winners, are not struggling.\n\nLet‚Äôs not forget VAR here. Thus far in Euro 2024, 8 goals have been ruled out for offside after VAR checks, 2 goals have been ruled out for handball after VAR checks, 1 goal has been ruled out for foul and 1 goal has been ruled out for encroachment. Lukaku alone has scored 3 goals ruled out for offside. The Germany-Denmark round of 16 game earlier tonight also had 3 goals ruled out for offside.\n\n10-15 years ago a lot of those goals would‚Äôve been allowed. Linesmen missed narrow offsides and refs missed discrete cases of handball (or just ignored them if it was apparent they didn‚Äôt impact the game in any way).\n\nBeing a consistently good striker is harder than ever.\n\nPersonally, I think we‚Äôll see some changes to the VAR system and rules applications after this tournament, because it‚Äôs ridiculous at times. The Danish goal ruled out earlier today for example, was ruled out because the Danish player literally had a toe out of line - if even that. There has to be some margin of error on the equipment? And when the margins are that narrow, it matters a lot *when* the VAR people decides that the ball was passed.\n\nThe toe offside - you'll always have this problem, as long as you're drawing a line from one side of the field to the other, it's going to come down to centimetre, whether the line is on a toe, heel, shoulder, head, etc there will always be tight calls no matter what you change the rules to\n\nExactly this. I don't know why people don't understand this. This semi automated system is fucking great. In 10-15 sec in background we get an aswer and then replay is shown later.¬†\nPeople think changing the rule would matter, but it won't. You will always have a focal point to assess, be it head, shoulder or toe, or as some people want the whole body. What if the whole body gap is 1mm, then it would still result in barest of margins.\n\nI just remembered Real Madrid winning the Champions League without a proper 9.\n\nArgentina be like: oh, my sub centerforward scored 4 goals, neat\n\nMy team in an amateur league in Nova Scotia has a number 9 problem üòÇüòÇ\n\nThe world has a number 9 problem. The reason behind this is because coaches around the world have adopted the Pep Guardiola style of football where strikers are more involved in build up play, and this has been taught in academies so we now have less prolific goal scorers. For the worse or better, honestly don't know. People often say that classic target man/poacher STs are needed but the importance of false 9s and STs getting more involved in build up play is no joke\n\n&gt;For the worse or better, honestly don't know.\n\nDefinitely for the worse, game's gone robotic, everyone tries to copy pep but it's only pep who wins playing that style, everyone plays the same bald bot ball and as a result we have chess-ass games like every England game in Euros or Man City v Ars draw in premier league, no creativity no flair only side pass &amp; back pass hoping for a lucky cut back goal, fake wingers like Grealish and company(Doku is on the way).\n\nThis is why Euro is especially good this time around, the teams which are winning ain't doing it the pep way, hell even spain abandoned it when they gave up possession against croatia for the first time in 16 years, and the teams losing and boring to watch are the ones trying hard to still copy pep or similar, Belgium England Netherlands etc compare that to Germany Spain Turkey Austria etc\n\n\nLike it or not football is set for a change , relationalism and player freedom is on the rise with more and more teams adopting , it's more vertical now, more direct, players like Musiala Wirtz Vini Lamal Nico Endrick Guler Mbappe Rodrygo and similar are the future, none of these are pep style players they way more direct, real wingers and dribbly bois who can also pass and link up  play, end to end football is on the rise.\n\nAnge will revolutionise world football when Spurs win this year with 200 goals for and 100 goals against.\n\nWritten in the stars\n\nA long, detailed answer with plenty of examples, then you end with \"dribbly bois\" üòÇüòÇ I'm dead\n\nI agree with you, football seems to be getting a bit more boring at the top level but what do you expect managers to do? They're there to win games, and this style of football is winning games so it's used. Entertainment wise, maybe for the worse but winning games wise, I think for the best\n\nI mean that's my point, when everyone tries to do the same thing nothing is special.\n\n&gt;this style of football is winning games so it's used\n\nI would beg to disagree, I propose the following : Are teams winning playing the bot-ball? Yes. Is it only due to bot ball? No, there's still a lot of individuals involved which are instrumental to that success, and which in my opinion are a more contributing factor to victories, for example Man City is not the same without KdB or Rodri, but they can manage just fine without Haaland or Grealish or Foden, so is it really the bot - ball that won man City the games or was it the key players? ESPECIALLY considering the fact that to play like pep  you need world class players , just have a look at Pep's spending history ( don't hit me with a Barca because they just had arguably the best academy generation of all time , and if that generation or similar bloomed in today's day and age at Barca or somewhere else,  pep at man City or even at Bayern would have gone after them). Then there's Arsenal as well, who is just a man City wannabe manifested, they haven't won anything significant in recent times. \n\nThe reality is there just aren't many teams at the top playing the pep-ball, and even among those who play like pep, only pep wins others just scrape by hiding behind \"beautiful ball\" , for example Barcelona, their defence overperformed in 2022 and they won the league, they didn't really play the pep ball,even if that's their \"DNA\", they were way more pragmatic with a sturdy defence, a lot of 1-0 wins(iirc most in the league).. that's not a lot of goals for someone claiming to be \"dominant\" , and defending is very anti pep ball where they \"defend by keeping the ball\". Also there's Barca from 21/22 who appointed Xavi cuz Koeman dragged them to 9th place, now Xavi did get them to 2nd place but was it because he was playing \"beautiful football\"? No . Remember Luuk De Jong's late winners ? Those cross and inshallah tactics, really \" beautiful \". You also see the amount of individualism that's inherent here as well, if not for those players stepping up Barca could've been out of the champions league as well ..... something that did happen eventually ..... twice, why did that happen? Players didn't step up, they crumbled under the pressure , remember the white army from Frankfurt in Camp Nou? The whole idea of pep ball is to create a system, a machine , drills and tactics so drilled into the players that they operate on \"auto pilot\", that's the entire underlying philosophy of pep ball, Barca in recent times failed miserably trying to play the pep way, embarassing European exits , beatings at the hand of Madrid. There are many more examples of different teams that would support my case , and probably even more which would go against my narrative, but the point still remains, that pep is the only guy to perfect pep-ball and all the attempts to copy it, especially at a cheaper level are fruitless, in the end football boils down to the basics of how good a team is together, how well do the players understand each other , there's a huge human element involved, you can't just  program players as cogs to be pulled in and out at wish , a huge deal of freedom is necessary for winning teams (which ironically is exactly what Messi used to have in the Barca golden days), freedom of movement, of creativity, of decisions.\n\n[deleted]\n\nArsenal are one of less restrictive top teams nowadays tbf. The best team in the world over the last 3 years, the one with two league tiles and Champions Leagues,  plays the freest football out of every top team. Perhaps there‚Äôs something in that.\n\nReal Madrid and Liverpool won the CL with a false 9, it's not only Pep who is successful with it\n\nOh, Pep style? The same style that has won back to back PL titles and a CL with Haaland as their striker?\n\nI wish people would stop with this take. Not everyone is playing Pep ball and it's irrelevant in creating a good striker. Pep has always had good strikers and style of play has nothing to do with being able to put the ball in the back of the net.\n\nThe problem is the good strikers are from the weaker national teams. Lewy haaland and osimhen just on the top of my head. I feel like for the france issue giroud is just getting old (he is still the all time top goalscorer for france) not sure how good marcus thuram is for the NT but he is doing a good job in serie a hope he gets a few tries after euros since giroud announced this is his last one\n\nGiroud was definitely a reliable number 9 for France. But as you said he is super old, it also doesn't help as most of the wonder kids nowadays are  not strikers\n\nYou can blame that on messi and ronaldo those two playing on the wings in their primes definitely inspire this generation of players coming in.\n\nI think it‚Äôs more than just that. I‚Äôve said it before, those two broke football. Harry Kane has just had a 44 goal season but it‚Äôs barely talked about because now the expectation of a great season is 50+ (Ronaldo has done that 8 times for the record). I remember in the 90‚Äôs a 20+ goal season, even for a No 9 was a good season.\n\nRonaldo and Messi really destroyed everyone's standards on what a good season is for a striker, that's how good they were\n\nIt baffles me how anyone doesn‚Äôt consider both of them top 2 all time. Like you might have your preference but damn ain‚Äôt nobody close to them literally.\n\nRight. Whether you pick Ronaldo or Messi as your üêê, but these 2 should be the only 1 and 2.\n\nFacts\n\nIts more because the game has become more tactical. As we have seen with haaland even the elite strikers get marked out of the big games. You cant put that kind of focus on the wings so the great technical players drift there like mbappe. \n\nStriker isn‚Äôt that guy anymore he is there to do a job most of the time these days if you know what i mean\n\nHaaland in his national team looks like a completely different player...\n\nWell the problem is even if you wanted to be like Haaland, you have to be at least 190 cm and a fucking monster.\n\nLewy is one that I have always looked forward to watching. He playing and position is unbelievable.¬†\n\nGiroud also used to miss soooo many chances for his clubs, watching him at Arsenal could be so painful at times.\n\n‚ÄúWhen you‚Äôre playing against a team that has two great central defenders, the best option is to play without a striker.‚Äù\n\n‚Äî Johan Cruijff\n\nThey followed his words too literally\n\nIt's a side-effect of scouting and educating talented young kids much better than we used to, I think. This quote underlines what happened very well.\n\nI used to play amateur football decades ago. My kids play it, varying from mediocre levels to playing against the youth teams of the likes of Ajax (in the Netherlands).\n\nOne thing that definitely changed is that when I was young there used to be big differences in skill in the same team and the same league level, and the best player ran circles around the worst. That best player also usually made most of the goals, and defensive tactics were largely ineffective compared to raw ball handling skill. Up to your teens number 9 was the place to be for max glory for min effort.\n\nNowadays you occasionally still see it in low level leagues. But players are matched to their level very well in the highest leagues from a very young age. Young players that are used to doing too much individually because they were far too good for their level usually get pushed back one or two lines when they go up a league, to teach them how to play effectively in a position with other (and better) players in front of them instead of always behind them feeding them with balls.\n\nAs a result the central defenders and defensive midfielders are hugely better and more organized than they used to be. That makes being a classic number 9 a tough and lonely job for kids playing on the highest levels. And perhaps even an underappreciated one. One of lots of bruises, few ball contacts, and little glory.\n\nThe game is evolving in a way that ‚Äúclassic‚Äù positions would soon be gone.\n\nNumber 10s are almost completely extinct nowdays. 9s have become hybrids. I mean Kane and Lewandowski (first came to mind) are more than capable of droping deeper and playmaking.\n\nTo add on to your point, I don‚Äôt think any position has been modified more over the past fifteen years than fullback.\n\nOh yes! They have skills of midfielders nowdays. I agree 100%.\n\nWell, yes but no. The game is definitely evolving, the positions are shifting, current meta might be 4-4-2 or 3-5-2 or 4-2-3-1 or whatever bullshit would be invented next, but you would still have defenders, midfielders, laterals, forwards - because a specialist is better than a generalist if used right. Havertz is a great player, but even Giroud is better as a dedicated striker. Using midfielder as a centerback shows how tricky it is - some coaches made it work, some failed miserably (see Kasemiro). I wouldn't even mention some attempts to make a rightback lateral play as DM. 10s aren't extinct imo, Bellingham plays pretty much a 10 in RM. Also a take: if your striker is forced to drop deep and make the plays, then your midfield isn't performing well.\n\nMy point is that players nowdays are capable of performing multiple tasks at the same time comparing to 80s and 90s era. \n\nCentral backs are now good with both feet, allowing teams to build from the back, defensive midfielders are no longer only defending players, they can create, dribble, pass and shoot, as well. Wingers they aren‚Äôt only about running &amp; crossing, they, go into channels, cut inside, etc. \n\nAs for the strikers, dropping deep doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean that midfield sucks, it‚Äôs more about using their other attributes to outnumber and allowing others to run into spaces.\n\nBellingham is IMO more of a second striker with No10 creativity.\n\nyes this. all the teams have great nr 9's, the tactic for everyone is just to make as many safe passes as possible. the wingers, instead of delivering the ball to penalty box, just pass it to central defender, and even if they have a good shot on the goal...\n\nmaybe its about player statistics, nobody wants to dribble anymore, like players worth 100 mil dont even take on defenders, their logic is \"uhm no 100% goal scoring pass available, imma pass to my goal keeper\"\n\nMessi talked about it, about how academies are trying to do what guardiola did in Barca and how it‚Äôs ruining the creativity of kids\n\nexactly, I personally don't really understand what position is Havertz\n\nI‚Äôd put him into a False 9 category. Think young Messi for example.\n\nYoung Messi (without the ability to dribble/score)\n\nThis isn‚Äôt a new phenomenon. Kids want to play like the people regarded as the best in the world. Right now every young player thinks they are Messi or Ronaldo so all the players who should be strikers are playing on the wings. A decade ago everyone wanted to be a number 10. Decade before then in the 90‚Äôs everyone wanted to be a ST which was why the PL had a golden age of ST. The main strikers role will come around again, just give it time.\n\nItaly too\n\nItaly is currently missing the numbers 1-99 though\n\nThey have the 99 tbf, Donnaruma had a good tournament.\n\nOh Right true\n\nI can't wait too see Camarda's debut in the national team.\n\nTurkish NT is basically playing 4-6-0 lol. Our only decent striker Enes √únal is sadly an injury prone and couldn't participate in this tournament.\n\nI watched the game vs Czech Republic and I was like \"wtf is Arda Guler doing at striker?\".\n\nThe last number 9 that I saw who really did the work was Benzema.\n\nBenzema was hardly a traditional 9 though. He was a full on 9/10 hybrid\n\nI think Benzema was the ultimate modern striker. Fantastic in buildup but still deadly af in the last third.\n\nMan I miss him so much, such a beauty to see this guy play at his peak\n\nThat ballon d'or season of Benzema was the best I've seen for a strike in this decade. Maybe equivalent to Bayern one but benzi did miracles in that season.\n\nBecause he wasn‚Äôt a ‚Äûtypical‚Äù number 9. He had outstanding creativity, which usually is a number 10 trait. Modern football playstyle doesn‚Äôt need a classic number 9, it is actually a disadvantage for a passing based playstyle.\n\nAnd he's not even a traditional 9.\n\nDarwin is doing the job for Uruguay\n\nThe industry only has itself to blame.\n\nAny youngsters showing decent qualities as a #9 are shifted to other positions and wingers are being more heavily relied on to fill in the gaps. The evolution of tactics to the front three hasn‚Äôt helped. Wingers are better all round players now but there‚Äôs an abundance of them and the vast majority of them can‚Äôt do a job at #9 because they haven‚Äôt been trained that way. \n\nVersatility has suffered a lot with the refinement of coaching and tactics.\n\nThere is a small group of 9s who are in a league of their own at the top. You can count them all on 1 hand if you live near a nuclear power plant.\n\nThat's why breaking transfer records for people like Isak and Nunez makes no sense to me. There are so many forwards in each of their respective tiers (or maybe you think they are in the same tier, but my point still stands).\n\n&gt;That's why breaking transfer records for people like Isak and Nunez makes no sense to me.\n\n\nHow many strikers are there in world football you would say are better than both Isak and Nunez?\n\nNo more than four or five, tops.\n\nBut people don't understand that\n\nNot many but neither of them are better than Dzeko who wasn‚Äôt really a top 10 striker in his prime.\n\nHang on, are you implying Isak is an average Centre forward?! Because he's probably top 10 in the world right now.\n\nWhat position did the Ronaldo from Brazil play? He was very good\n\n[deleted]\n\nBigger Stronger than Jasp Stam?\n\nTechnical and positional intelligence than Maldini?\n\nYou've got to be joking. Football wasn't invented 10yrs ago.\n\nThe point is that average center back nowaday compare to back then. But if you are that much nostalgia bias then Virgil Van Dijk is bigger and stronger than Jaap Stam with actual technical ability other than pure brute strength, Thiago Silva at his prime and Ruben Dias might well compare with Maldini and Saliba can be soon follow suit.\n\nOne man army position.\n\nRonaldo clears\n\nJokes aside, even at 39 he's a better striker than most in the Euros.\n\nWe aren't in the early 2010s or 90s, strikers aren't as prevalent now as then\n\nYeah it's definitely because striker nowadays are expected to do lot's of things and not Just be a poacher.\n\nBut my points stays if a good striker were to show up in one of this big teams they could probably dominate super hard\n\nHaaland, yet city didn't dominate Europe. Hes a true nr 9\n\nHaaland isn't constant and City did dominate Europe last year.   \n\nAnd they also dominated Madrid super hard.\n\nWeird way to dominate. And Haaland has a carreeer with equal goals to matches before Guardiola ruined him. So dont come to me with not constant\n\nItaly hasn't had a 9 since Luca Toni its sad üò¢\n\nWell, they had Mario for a little bit.\n\n‚ÄòEngland does have the best European striker, but, well, Southgate‚Äô\n\nYes it‚Äôs Southgate‚Äôs fault Kane hasn‚Äôt been able to control the ball, complete a short pass or shoot toward the same postcode as the goal in this tournament.\n\nOh sorry it's because kalvin Phillips is injured\n\nI can't work out why Southgate didn't take him since the lack of his replacement is the issue\n\nI would like to know which of them decided it‚Äôs a good idea for him to drop so deep he can‚Äôt get in the box before the ball arrives\n\nFr someone needs to tell him he ain't messi\n\nKane has always dropped deep on occasion, it's a great part of his game, it's just the runners around him haven't been present in the England squad\n\nInterchanging positions is a massive part of the modern game. Wingers come inside while inverted fullbacks race up the wing. Strikers like Lewy and Kane have always been able to drop back and find runners, and doing that can pull defenders out of position while an attacking player can make runs into the box from anywhere. Hell, the glory days of BBC at Real Madrid are very similar as well.\n\nHim dropping back is perfectly fine, the issue is that nobody makes the run in behind the huge space he opens\n\nNo, it‚Äôs still a problem, because when we drop deep it deprives us of what we need him on the pitch for. We have other players that can cover every other part of his skillset except finishing/poaching. If he is lumbering past the halfway line when the cross comes in, he‚Äôs no use to anyone\n\nI'd call this the CR7 effect: kids that could have been developed into becoming a number 9 are encouraged to be Cristiano style wingers, especially if they're fast.\n\nPerhaps there's also a case of clubs not being able to identify players that have the qualities of a 9\n\nI‚Äôve scrolled a long way and am yet to see the name of possibly the most complete CF in the world, Alexander Isak - Sweden have some attacking threat; how‚Äôre they not in Germany?\n\nIsak is definitely really good, but unfortunately he is also stuck with a very weaker national team\n\nNo, defenders and tactics have made what you perceive as a 9 absolutely almost obsolete unless you are essentially the modern day Muller (which is essentially what Ronaldo become and Haaland).\n\nMost of these \"problems\" you think.... would be considered top players in the 90';s to early 2000's no problem.\n\nI agree and I find it wierd people not looking at the other side and even realizing defenders have gotten better (both as individual players and as team players).\n\nLaughs in Gyokeres\n\nWould playing a 2 St system help? Seems many teams just rely on the 1 these days.\n\nThe world has a problem: defensive tactics by 85% of the teams. And 5-3-2.\n\nNo striker will touch the ball.\n\nTbf Lukaku has been pretty efficient, just unlucky that all his goals were disallowed. We have much bigger problems\n\nKane is being restricted by the coach's tactics, and it is sad to watch.¬†\n\nFullkrug?\n\nWe need Walter Pandiani\n\nI think the style of play has evolved. Too much reliance on possession reduces the need of having a prolific No.9 I guess. \n\nHaaland is a great striker, no doubt about that. However, he usually draws a blank during crunch games against top teams. More possession usually means a striker who heavily depends on the midfield feeding the ball to him and thus is a tap-in meister at best.\n\nPlaying a 1 striker system is the problem. There I said it.\n\nBlame it on Pep, on his false 9\n\nHarry Kane is good, but Southgate plays him too deep\n\nLukaku has been good this tournament, despite Belgium being terrible overall.\n\nYeah, OP is just clueless. Lukaku und Morata played well in group stage. The 10 goals in 4 games Germany team with Havertz and F√ºllkrug both at 2 goals has for sure not a striker issue. Adding England and France to that list is hilarious. And somehow OP also missed the strikers from so called smaller teams who did quite good for their teams so far.\n\nKai havertz pulling off a beautiful touch is through on goal one on one with the keeper and then misses lmao\n\nWhy are you pretending Lukaku isn‚Äôt one of the most prolific scorers of the last decade?\n\nMajor facts, it‚Äôs an epidemic\n\nThe traditional no.9 has been replaced with the change of tactics. The new era of football.\n\ncoaches followed the science and have prioritized every other aspect of a striker's game besides scoring lamao\n\nI don't think it's limited to number 9s. \n\nCompared to 10 or 15 years ago, there is a distinct lack of world class players\n\nmost teams play with 3 at the back with wing backs so everyone cancels each other out half the time\n\nThey switched the new generations of 9‚Äôs to play in central midfield/defense, and left the attack to nimble players, because that‚Äôs what Guardiola did. Now that he has Haaland, we‚Äôre gonna return to normal within a decade or so.\n\nIn the old days best players wanted to be strikers because that's where you scored goals. Defenses are also better now and there is less space in the middle so best attackers are now wingers, player like Michael Owen would never be a striker now. How many times per season does the striker go through on goal in this day and age and compare it to Ronaldo dribbling past the keepers a million times in his career\n\nYou've missed Croatia. Croatia had the biggest xG after 3 games, if I recall correctly.\n\nthis isn't really the case.\n\nfootball has moved away from an obvious number 9. a lot of domestic clubs don't have one. it will come back around, but don't expect the same number of chances to be created, when the systems change,\n\nIt's a tactical approach problem. Teams look to wear the opposition down maintaining possession and focusing play on the flanks. \n\nWe no longer see tactics where long balls are played to a strong number 9 to win them and retain possession long enough to enable quick shots from supporting teammates. \n\nThis change of tactical approach to the game makes the number 9 role a secondary one in the minds of many coaches development plans.\n\nEuropean football does have a 9 problem.\n\nWe need Bluelock project\n\nRonaldo can still finish. I love Levensowski\n\nPlayers are becoming \"General forwards\"- look at people like Rashford, Jesus, Richarlison, Son... Even Mbapp√©.\n\nThey all CAN play either wide or centre forward but are generally better at one over the other. It's becoming increasingly common that the best centre forward options a team has is actually better out wide or at least not as a traditional 9.\n\nSome (Les Ferdinand for example) think it's the effect of Messi and Ronaldo- two players who were for much of their career not centre forwards at all. I don't subscribe to that argument, I think it's the effect of 4-2-3-1 where the superstar players tend to be the inside forwards coming in from out wide and the actual 9 often does a pretty functional role of facilitating those stars rather than being the main man himself.\n\nCentre Forward stopped being the most exciting position to want to be as a kid so people train for those much needed skills and knowledge less than they used to- preferring to be a more dynamic \"General Forward\".\n\nI was actually thinking this, we don't have any top up and coming elite strikers.\n\nMay I know what's the difference between #9 and #11 ?\n\nFrance has a good 9 that has been better than Mbapp√© in ligue 1 the last two seasons but somehow he hasn't been called up since 2016\n\n+ playmakers in midfield.\n\nObvs love a good shot, but I also miss the magic of a playmaking 8 etc.\n\nThe thing abt Germany is (and from my lesser knowledge I think this applies to other countries to), there are a few classically trained 9s, but they‚Äôre not the best players so coaches play better players to maintain their system but the people they‚Äôre playing are just not strikers so they lack certain abilities.\n\nNow that I think abt it tht seems to apply more to a lot of clubs rather than countries. But Yh Germany is doing that because we have an excess of forward players and a lack of strikers (on that level).\n\nLukako has everything a number 9 has to have, but his inconsistency is terrifying. If he would have been able to maintain his best form throughout his career, he probably would have won a at least one ballon d‚Äòor.\n\nWhy the recently knocked out team isn't mentioned ? Italy was one of the best teams in the world and one pretty consistent if you ask me . But that Scamaca dude barely touched the ball in the game against Switzerland and in the first half he didn't touch it at all .\n\nA lot of football games just aren‚Äôt even built for them anymore either, a good no. 9 will still look poor against some opposition purely because of how each team plays.\n\nI‚Äôd say the pure No.9 hasn‚Äôt existed for a while as they‚Äôre expected to do a whole lot more than be a poacher; if they solely try to do that they‚Äôll be invisible or a man down.\n\nCrazy to me how Uruguay for being such a small country manage to always produce great to world class strikers\n\nThe thing is it‚Äôs probably impossible to be an all round striker these days with the quality of defenders and organised team tactics and also to suit the tactics of how teams want to play. \n\nFor germany I don‚Äôt think they really have a problem, or it‚Äôs being beaten up. \n\nF√ºllkrug is a better finisher than Havertz for example, but the reason Havertz plays over F√ºllkrug is that Havertz makes the team better, the wingers and midfielders play better as a result of the chaos he causes with his elite positioning, and ability to win pretty much every header. He has everything but finishing (sadly)\nIt works because Wirtz, Musiala and gundo can all contribute to the goals. \n\nF√ºllkrug is a bit more of a classic striker (has less dimensions to his play) and he suits a great purpose of being brought in as a super sub battering ram, also maybe after Nagelsmann have seen how the others team has layed out their tactics and adjusted in the second half and he brings in F√ºllkrug in to finish them off with his finishing and power.\nAlso if you‚Äôre all out of ideas he suits a lob it into the box kind of play style.\n\nI think people really need to get over the fact that if something isn‚Äôt in the started 11 it doesn‚Äôt mean they are not seen as a particularly useful weapon.\n\nEhhh. This stuff always works in cycles. The game will change. It always does.\n\nPlaying as a lone nine is just not very possible unless you have a completely elite profile. And Havertz has elite output as a number 9 this season.¬†\n\n\nYou need to look at what the player in that position does for the whole team.¬†\n\nThe best 9s are still european so I don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre getting at?\n\nFor once I won‚Äôt blame Southgate. Kane is a number 9, but he refuses to play the poacher role. The only thing that allows him to not do so is the fact that he‚Äôs probably one of the best passers in the England team, but it completely wrecks the whole point of a number 9 when they basically drop off into the 8/10 role half the time. He‚Äôs done it everywhere he goes. \n\nFrance is the perfect example. Giroud had ZERO (0) shots on target when they won the World Cup. But his hold up play, link up play and presence is the reason griezmann and Mbappe did so well that year.\n\nNumber 9s don't exist now because of possession obsession. Wingers also. All that is produced now is biring players who just want to go sideways.\n\nHow can people blame this on the \"Ronaldo effect\". Yes, he was a flashy winger, 15 years ago.\n\nIf anything. CR7 is the purest 9 still in the Euro. There is a reason they call him the tap in merchant, penaldo, etc...\n\nIt's all down to the Pep mindset. So much that Halaand disappeared in the UCL games. And look, Real without a 9 still won the UCL, yes with a random appearance of Joselu, a supposed 9... But currently, false 9 is all the rage. A 9 playing back to goal putting passes onto the very trendy CAMs for them to score. Germany has 3 CAM!!! Kay, Wirtz and Mussiala! They have been circle jerking all the way to goal.\n\nBut the truth is defense lines are SOLID. So strikers can just run behind defenders. And CBs are better at headers than other people so crosses aren't getting anywhere. CBs are so good at heading that they are the ones scoring own goals from crosses.\n\nBluelock\n\nThe average level of football players in general has decreased consistently in the last 10 years. The peak of the 90s-00s, with the perfect combination of high technique and athleticism, is very far away. Nowadays, it's common to find good athletes but not good footballers.\n\nAnd they ask why liverpool doesn't have a good striker\n\ni dont want to see those false 9's linking up with their wingers like a #10. i want a 6'4\" muscle man to stay up top and twat the ball in the back of the net whenever he gets it. the world misses this type of strikers\n\nThe way modern football is played now, the art of being a #9 has become less attractive to young talent. They all become inverted wingers or purely #10's now. Blame Pep Guardiola lol\n\nNowadays, schemes and formations drive a greater emphasis on \"passing from the back\". There is little to no use of target men in today's football. Crossing the ball into the box is rare for most teams. Most attacks nowcome from inverted wingers or through the middle.\n\nUntil the tactics change, the #9 of yester-year will be hard to find.\n\nYeah none of the wonder kids nowadays are number 9, arda guler, Bellingham, musiala, Writz, yamal the only big name wonderkid who plays 9 is endrick probably. But i don't know how good he is tbh.\n\nAnd I thought it's Chelsea who have a number 9 problem\n\nHaving a \"target man\" is seen as a waste of a shirt. Players are expected to do more than just hang around waiting for service (except CR7 of course)\n\nI think it‚Äôs a pretty world wide problem.\n\nTo me, I‚Äôm not a coach, but it looks like coaching a kid to be a good, complete striker would be quite difficult. More straightforward to put the gifted kids on the wings or in midfield. \n\nFirst they have to have good technique and be strong/comfortable in the air. Then you have to consider all the responsibilities of a striker. Isolated against 2 cbs, not much space to run into and dribble, you‚Äôre playing with your back to goal, you must have good off the ball movement, whether it‚Äôs false runs or timing runs to beat offside traps, and your heavily reliant on your teammates to feed you the ball. Sounds like a tall ask to teach all this to a kid.  They‚Äôd much rather run at people on the wings.\n\nWeird to mention France against the Netherlands since the thing they were missing was their striker who missed the match with a broken nose and has issue with you referring to Kane as the best european striker. Football in general though is moving away from the main focal point striker. You do still have players like Haaland who's job is to occupy the centerbacks and make runs in behind and be targeted with crosses, but more teams are wanting a Havertz type who drops out into different space from the striker position and opens up space for everyone else which Havertz did incredibly for Arsenal this season. Arsenal became a significantly better team this year when they abandoned a more traditional number nine for Havertz.\n\nDarwin is probably the best 9 in international football right now. 10 goals in his last 7 matches and an absolute workhorse.\n\nIts the obsession of playing with inverted wingers.\n\nIt's not a Europe problem, it's a global problem. I don't know what's happening nowadays but no one is developing good strikers.\n\nnorway has the best european striker.\n\n&gt;F√ºllkrug is there, but he doesn't get enough play time, so it's hard to judge him.\n\nHe absolutely got enough play time this season to judge him. I think he's better at chance-converdsion and especially at headers than Havertz.\n\nOur #9 is from the other side of the world. Then got injured pre-tournament.\n\n*sighs in Scottish*\n\nLukaku did his job again and again in this euro, for all the memes against him, he is absolutely prolific for Belgium. He has just been very unlucky with VAR.\n\nNorway have two great #9s and one of the currently best 10s. Just everyone else could be replaced by my granny.\n\nNumber 9 doesn't exist because clubs don't need them anymore . Since the days of Ronaldo and Messi we have wingers and Midfielders outscoring strikers . Some clubs do need a target man but most managers (atleast the decent ones) have found ways to score without one\n\nAlso remember that most of them now don't play that typical number 9 tactics where it requires such a striker, they're adapting"

This guy has to move on.\n\nIf Vini said this shit y'all would crucify him.\n\nlol claiming that Rodri has to move on when it was the entire Real Madrid team that threw a toddler tantrum because they didn't come first (only 2nd, 3rd, best team and best manager).\n\n4th too. Rodri, Vini, Jude and Dani in that order\n\n3rd actually. Wales, golf, Madrid. In that order.\n\nBellingham and Carvajal over Kroos is the real robbery to be fair. \n\nLook at Madrid without Kroos‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs like Rodri for Madrid, but for 10 years.\n\n4 players in the top 5 but they felt disrespected lol\n\nMaybe if city hadn't cheated they might have more respect. Bit ironic coming from the masters of cheating though ha\n\nIm actually neutral on this topic but if u look back its rodri who hasnt moved on lol\n\nVinicius and RM have embarrassed themselves over this, and in doing so have insulted Rodri. \n\nRodri is perfectly entitled to point this out.\n\n...If Vini said that he didn't respect RM's boycott?\n\nI doubt City would be so petty as to not attend the award in the first place. Only one club could feel that entitled.\n\nEh famous players like Messi and CR have skipped it before when they found out they weren't going to win tbf\n\nCan't recall messi or cr7 telling their entire team not to show up though\n\nGiven how ridiculously Madrid acted over this whole thing, I'd say he has more a right to comment on it. He didn't start this or bring up the subject. Madrid are the ones who acted like 10 year olds.\n\nVini went on the stupidest interview rampage last year lmao I think it‚Äôs only fair others can too‚Ä¶ especially if you won the bdor\n\nUnlike vino he actually won shit. You make me praise a manc player ffs, just sof off.\n\nLol, no we wouldn't. If Vini won Ballon d'Or and Man City started throwing a tamper tantrun we'd meme on them just as hard.\n\n*Footballer gets asked questions in interviews*\n\n*Footballer responds with answers*\n\n\"Oh my God he just won't shut up!!!\"\n\nIf you're going to blame someone, blame journalists.\n\nYou might be shocked to hear that he isn‚Äôt forced to give these answers or take these interviews. He is, in fact, choosing to say this stuff.\n\nPlayers are contracted to do media work, and why would he not answer the question it would be pointless to just say no comment for all of the questions\n\n\"No comment\"\n\nThese same people: \" Omg Rodri is such a cry baby! Why cant he just let it go?!\"\n\nWorst part is these people will complain and defend Real Madrid no matter what he said.\n\nHe's currently out injured, almost every single player takes on more media work when they're out injured. As much as some hate it, players have to build their profile through the media.\n\nYea, he's choosing to answer questions that he is asked, so what? He keeps getting asked these questions because the outrage from RM and their fans over Vini not winning one subjective award decided by a bunch of journalists has been ridiculous.\n\nHe'll stop getting asked these questions once RM fans stop crying üòÇ\n\nFucking Rodri. How dare he talk to the media after receiving most important individual award in history of football and say obvious thing like: \"I don't respect that people i won against boycotted my achievement\".\n\nMadrid wasn't forced to act like children. They chose to. They can now deal with people calling them out on it.\n\nTBF who can? It has to be disrespectful from Rodri's POV. A great achievement just called a sham but such a major institution\n\nWho gives a shit? \n\nRodri is full of shit. He can feel \"disrespected\" all he wants. This is the douchebag that critiqued Vini's off the field antics for why he's not deserving ü§£ü§£ü§£\n\nVini is building schools in Brazil while Rodri... does what? Lol but hey what fits the narrative, right?\n\nThat‚Äôs great and all that Vini‚Äôs building schools in Brazil, but how exactly does that help him win the Ballon d‚ÄôOr?\n\nYou are proving the point. Off pitch actions doesn't decide winner but rodri thinks opposite of that.\n\nWhy are you crying like Vini? You know you won't win any awards?\n\nIt‚Äôs a Real Madrid thing, they think if they cry enough someone will give them an award for it\n\nGive him the building schools d‚ÄôOr right now\n\nBuilding schools in Brazil is (probably) great. But what the fuck does that have to do with the Ballon D'Or? It's not an award for giving back to the community. If it was, no footballer would win it.\n\nBingo üòÇ\n\nAnd yet Rodri brought up Vini's activities off the field..  why?\n\nMan, y'all are so fucking biased.\n\nBuilding schools doesn't give him a pass to act like a dick off the pitch, and act like a bitch on the pitch. He can build universities on Mars and he still needs to start acting like an actual adult before he gets any respect.\n\nDoesn't help building schools in Brazil while being a jerk on the field.\n\n\"Vini is building schools in Brazil\"\n\nWho gives a shit?\n\nLeast pathetic plastic fan\n\nPeople here acting like it was Rodri crying over not winning the ballon d'or\n\nShe‚Äôs crying even after winning it\n\nHe keeps yapping tho. This is from a very recent interview in a podcast. \n\nEDIT downvote me. If it was vini saying things like this you would all be hating. I don‚Äôt think vini talk back to city like this after they scraped the win at the Etihad earlier this year\n\nWhite guy known for teasing rivals, diving, busquet midfield maestro \n\nBlack guy known for teasing rivals diving vini jr. unsportsmanlike he should take the loss he should take the racism \n\nThat is prejudice\n\nI would be saying the same thing if the positions were flipped. If Vini won and Rodri boycotted the ceremony due to his entitlement I'd call Rodri a sore fucking loser who is disrespectful towards his rivals and I'd be fine with Vini calling him out. Vini lost the award because he lost and instead of looking and realizing that he lost because he got outscored by 30+ players in the top 5 leagues, him and Madrid acted like it was a conspiracy against him. \n\n\n\nI'm not sure why you are surprised that the bloody Ballon D'or winner is getting interviews, but your criticism makes no sense. You'll probably ignore what I said though and just say I'm racist.\n\nVini is the b1tch yapper. He doesn't stfu with his victim mentality. That's why he gets what he deserves. He's a provocative lil c*nt with a massive ego. He needs humility. Rodri talks when he's asked questions. There's a difference. I wouldn't expect you to understand. You only see difference in colour. Dirty racist.\n\nI remember how Real Madrid board and fans talked about Ronaldinho. Then he destroyed you over and over again to a standing ovation from the Bernabau. And all with a big smile. If only Vini let his football do the talking... oh wait... he can't... cus he's the victim. Remember?\n\nLet me remind you, Vini did A SINGLE TWEET about the subject, then he never spoke about it again, while Rodri is yapping about subjective things like he's somehow a omniscient god just because he won a ballon dor.\n\n  \nBesides if he's suffering racism he should just shut up and accept it? He's right about that, there's something wrong with the Spanish society and the European one in general, no player should be called mono in the middle of a match for no reason\n\nOops you wrong. Vini talking way more shit then that but nice try inventing bs to back up your sensitive lil narrative. Either way 1 tweet bitching is 1 more than Rodri hahahaha, people ask questions and he responds. See the difference? Vini should know his place. A footballer not a social media influencer or whatever the fuck. Rodri won, get over it or cry more, no one gives a shit.\n\nSuffering racism? Like when Madrid fans threw bananas at Dani Alves? Nothing wrong with Spanish society you dirty racist. There's idiots in all countries. Most idiots here in Spain wear Real Madrid shirts and they're the most racist of all, even if they've recently collected themselves some players with melanin. Know your history, stop spreading bullshit and most importantly... Marco Asensio ballon d'oro BAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA\n\nIt really is unbelievably racist to vote a black man as the second most talented football on the planet /s\n\nRodri has every right to complain. He didn‚Äôt choose to win but Real Madrid chose to throw a temper tantrum.\n\nReal Madrid throwing their toys out of the pram was so deeply childish. I just cannot imagine there wasn‚Äôt a single grown up in the chain of decision making that was able to point out that they‚Äôd look like massive fannies.\n\nIt really isn‚Äôt that big of a deal that they didn‚Äôt attend. Other clubs have done this in the past. Everyone just making it a bigger deal than it is.\n\nReally? Who previously has refused to attend because their player wasn‚Äôt going to win?\n\nColchester United refuse to attend every year.\n\nBarcelona, but people don‚Äôt even remember that. You mfs just love to hate fr fr\n\nI genuinely don‚Äôt remember that. What year and over what player or award? \n\nIt absolutely wouldn‚Äôt surprise me as Barca are fragile and entitled wankers too, but if they did the same as Real, it certainly wasn‚Äôt as big a news story.\n\nNo club has ever done this before:\n\nthe club said in a statement to AFP and Spanish media.\n\"As this was not the case, it is clear that Ballon d'Or-Uefa does not respect Real Madrid. And Real Madrid does not go where it is not respected.\"\n\nI for one want Rodri to keep giving interviews every single day as it seems to piss off Real Madrid fans so much (especially the \"global\" fans)\n\nIdk he seems pretty pissed lol understandable since even after winning the Ballon d'or people still talk more about Vini\n\nNot really, most people and media have stopped. It's just clown Madridistas or Brazilians.\n\ncorrect\n\nYea this would probably be the only way to piss them off. Otherwise, they‚Äôre always winning.\n\nNewcastle supporter here. No bias. Rodri was a deserving winner, and should also have won the EPL player of the season last year instead of Foden. Real Madrids entitled stance on this was beyond ridiculous.\n\nSo petty, probably the most privileged club ever in world football crying unfair is insane.\n\nYou are now banned from r/realmadrid\n\nThat seems more like a reward then anything‚Ä¶\n\nWell other then hanging around outside nurseries where else will see such childish meltdowns?\n\nLol got paid from this subreddit within 2 hours of commenting\n\nAlso the way that man city has been without him shows how good/important rodri was\n\nHmmm\n\nRodri, born and raised in Madrid.\n\nFlorentino is losing his mind.\n\nhe's an ateltico boi obviously\n\nWhen will this sub learn that real fans dont give fuck if someones born in madrid when hes only played for their RIVAL?? This is like saying that arsenal fans should be happy chelsea player won balon d‚Äôor if hes born in London\n\n??\n\nCourtois sing against real Madrid celebrating trophies with their RIVAL and they r happy with him.\n\nYour example has nothing to do with what I have said.\n\nI'm not asking Madrid fans to be happy for Rodri.\n\nBut the fact that the most important club in Madrid is not present at the gala where, for the first time in history, a player from Madrid is going to win the Ballon d'Or... is strange. It's like Tito Floren is losing his mind.\n\nThey are happy with courtois bc he plays for them now, same would be with Rodri lol\n\n&gt;Your example has nothing to do with what I have said.\n\n&gt;I'm not asking Madrid fans to be happy for Rodri.\n\n&gt;But the fact that the most important club in Madrid is not present at the gala where, for the first time in history, a player from Madrid is going to win the Ballon d'Or... is strange. It's like Tito Floren is losing his mind.\n\nCan you explaying why you think it matters for real that for the first time in history, a player from Madrid is winning a ballon d‚Äôor? It‚Äôs not some crazy insane unmissable thing that a player from the same city is winning it lol\n\nI have no love for Rodri, but he's 100% right.\n\nI mean is Madrid the ones who still crying about it. Pointing finger to journalist just a couple days ago even.\n\nRM's hissy fit will never stop being funny to me. Please keep asking him about it until he retires.\n\nSo much haters here lmao\n\nHe's not wrong. Even if you know you're not winning, you should attend the ceremony, it's part of sportsmanship.\n\nSeriously. It was a classless act.\n\nRodri himself was bot going until he was told he was winning it\n\nWell he's 100% right. Madrids stance was like a toddler throwing his toys out the pram, or a kid taking his ball home so no one else can play. \nExtremely sore losers.\n\nSurely this approach just mean Vini has zero chance of winning in future.\n\nI think it would make you think twice about voting for a madrid player. \nObviously if they were clearly the best in the world then you'd probably still vote for them I guess.\n\nI can't respect Citys 115 charges or your chanting about Gibraltar\n\nBeing hung up on Gibraltar is the marginally less embarrassing version of obsessing over 'Las malvinas'. Let them be sausages.\n\nPlease as if Madrid haven't even been doing dodgy deals....like a training ground being sold for 400 million iirc.. I'm sure it was above board  s/\n\n1 colonial country crying about the other, over Gibraltar is funny in, a ironic way tho\n\nWhat's this about Gibraltar?\n\nLMAO you can't be this pathetic\n\nReal Madrid is incredibly embarrassing. Bunch of crybaby bitches that fans, players, and the owners.\n\nHow many interviews is this guy doing man\n\nEvery sensible football fan lost a ton of respect after Real Madrid players threw a temler tantrum. I remember being quite surprised that the Ninja Turtle himself was relatively quiet around this whole mess.\n\nMadrid can even make someone likable who is otherwise playing for a corrupt, evil, murderous regime\n\nAre you referring to American owners?\n\nMe: I can't respect someone who plays for a cheating club.\n\nHe wasnt the best player in the league, wasnt the best player in his country, are u kidding me, he is one of the worst Ballor Dors of all time\n\nthis mf still talking, his undeserved ballon d'or will remain a scandal in corrupt history of fifa and uefa .. 7 fuckin new \"journalists\" were told to do not put Vini in their Top 10 list !!! Can you believe it ! you are picking the best players and Vini isn't among them !!? \nüéà dor lost its credibility long time ago with Messi and now it's just a corrupt scandalous org\n\nI can‚Äôt respect this clown bitch personally\n\nAfter winning this trophy, city have been in so much trouble. Maybe it's a Vini curse\n\nRodri the most overrated midfielder in recent times. \n\nSomebody ask him if he respects his employee for making use of shady business practices and the 115 charges hanging over their head \n\n\nTryna see something\n\nReal madrid fans in shambles over this. How dare he say anything about the completely childish thing the whole RM organisation did over an awards show?\n\nShambles? üòÇ\n\nYou guys better hope Madrid don't catch fire and win their 16th. This place will be on suicide watch again.\n\nGosh RMA fans are insufferable\n\nReal Madrid must be the most annoying club on the planet. They have two newspapers supporting them and lobbying on their behalf and those two papers,.especially Marca stood behind the Balon D'or no-show. Pathetic.\n\nThe Ballon D'Or is so overly coveted these days. I get it's important for individual players but the amount of attention fans and journalists give it is crazy. Hell, even some players place too much importance on it. It's basically because of the Ro naldo/Messi rivalry. \n\nReal Madrid boycotting the ceremony is just incredibly petulant. You've got more European Cups/Champions Leagues than any other club and you're throwing a tantrum because one player doesn't get a well-known individual award. Ffs. It's a team game and team trophies are more important than individual awards.\n\nPersonally I think everyone should boycott Real Madrid for their behaviour.  But literally everyone who doesn‚Äôt supports them already hates them anyway so no need really.  It was petty and unfair on a well deserving player like Rodri.\n\nWhy isn't there a best player award for every position? Would make it much fairer\n\nI guess people would think that it would cheapen the award a bit, much like how the Oscar for best picture isn't separated into best action film, best comedy film etc. Also in the age of positional rotation, the lines between attacker and midfielder become pretty blurred. \n\nThe true solution is for people to not take the Ballon d'Or all that seriously. It's a completely subjective award governed by a french football magazine and is decided by journalists, yet people act like it's the World Cup of individual players.\n\nFilm buffs have learned to not take the Oscars all that seriously, football fans and players need to learn the same.\n\nDo you guys who keep posting this like football or drama?\n\ntrue\n\nWhy would he\n\nSo good seeing Madrid not performing after they had a sook about the balloon.\n\nNo one should respect it\n\nLol\n\nKinda rich coming from guy who won it, despite being out injured half the year‚Ä¶\n\nThe boycott was pathetic, same as Vini's performances for Brazil.\n\nManchester United vs FK Bodo/Glimt | 3-2 | Match Highlights | UEFA Europa League\nhttps://youtu.be/m6vfcXc3VSE\n\nAll of a sudden, he started talking too much. Enjoy your Ballon D'Or and rest!¬†\n\nAre we still on this topic?\n\nNo one respects the boycott. Big babies. Glad liverpool dominated them\n\nRodri well deserved over Vini. Like not even close. Florentino Perez is a giant stain on the football community.\n\nYou know the importance of Rodri when City played 60 games with him without loosing and when he is out the time loses 5 in a row.\n\nYeah, it was just classles act from Real Madrid.\n\nlet it go dude, your team is boycotting wins at the moment\n\nMe too brother\n\nThis boycott proves why no current RMA player should even be in question for Ballon d'Or. It was an insane display of unsportsmanship\n\nImagine not showing up because you thought you were going to lose. Real should keep that energy for the next round of the Champions League.\n\nWho cares? Maybe you can carry your Ballon d‚Äôor along with your club 115 charges, soon.\n\nHe should go to Real Madrid (proper elite team) not the try hard wannabe man shitty lot. He‚Äôd fit right in and then they can all go to the ballon dor together yay\n\nIf Ramos was still in Real I bet every one of these fuckers would have taken their asses to the ceremony.\n\nRMA behavior was childish but also Rodri winning ballon d‚Äôor was childish too.\n\nMore like a tantrum. Babies.\n\nThe more he tries to justify his win, the more it seems questionable.\n\nThen bro wasn‚Äôt even at the FIFA men‚Äôs player of the year üíÄ then Vini won that and globe soccer awards\n\nGets an ACL injury and the Ballon D'or now he wont stop talking...\n\nWell he can‚Äôt play football can he\n\nInjured player with free time gets invited on podcasts‚Ä¶ crazy\n\nWould you like him to just go silent when he's asked the question in an interview? Lmao\n\nWas a major fuckup to inform them in advance that their guy is not winning it, super unprofessional.\n\nAnd I agree it is disrespectful to say our man is not getting the prize so we boycott the ceremony. Did Rodri deserve it? In my eyes yes. Did Vinicius deserve it? Probably also yes. I would say it was close. But it is poor sportsmanship to discredit the other player by boycotting the ceremony if you do not win. And it is super unprofessional to leak the result beforehand.\n\nThe award info are already given to the player's team on who will win and even sponsor company such as Adidas and Nike are already preparing for it. If anything, the team coming there expecting something because it was said their player was winning only for another team to come due to the same thing is a very scummy move. That's practically humiliating the former if anything.\n\nBro is still on this? Lol\n\nwhy is he still talking about this? No one cares but him.\n\nI don‚Äôt know if you know this, but famous people tend to do interviews and get asked questions.\n\nIt‚Äôs not like he‚Äôs DMed ESPN asking for them to publish this.\n\nThere's this thing in the English language called a question. It's where someone asks you something. In almost all cultures, when someone asks you a question, you answer it. \n\nOut of curiosity, what culture are you from? You must be from one of the very few that doesn't answer questions when you're asked since you're so confused by him answering a question. \n\nI hope you answer even though it goes against your cultural values.\n\nWhy would you ask him what culture he is from? If they don‚Äôt know what questions are all you have done is confuse him!\n\nThe English language has plenty of words and he can clearly choose a different set of words to answer in a more respectable manner though I don‚Äôt think this response is the one that is problematic. Commenting about Vinicius‚Äôs activism as a distraction is problematic though.\n\nGuardiola  sure cares a lot\n\nNever seen a yapper like him\n\nNever imagined I would find myself hoping for him to start playing again, but if that's what'll eventually shut him up...\n\nMeanwhile, it‚Äôs so easy for you to just not listen to an interview.\n\nExactly as easy as it is for you to not read and reply to a comment.\n\nLot of bitterness from Madridistas. You lost. Its okay. Wait, you lost again, didn't you? And Mbappe flopped. Damn. At least, you have 15 UCLs. Oh wait, most were paid off by refs. Wait, you're a prestigious club... hmm you were chosen by the royalty and a representation of a fascist regime. Okay, at least you have a nice stadium.\n\n[deleted]\n\nYou seem to\n\nYeah shame on him for answering a direct question\n\nWait till RM find out Vinicius won the Fall on floor award.\n\nI have never seen a single BD‚Äôor winner yap this much in my life. I don‚Äôt remember seeing Benzema, Modric, Messi, CR7, Kaka or anyone else who went on to a press tour after winning it. I don‚Äôt remember Messi ever saying a word about Lewandoski/Haaland after winning the BD‚Äôor. Madrid boycotted the program for whatever reason and have not said anything since, I don‚Äôt remember Vini saying anything since either, and yet I will be called a Madrid fan crybaby for saying I don‚Äôt want to see Rodri‚Äôs bitch ass yapping anymore.\n\nMe: i can't respect Man City's \"achievements\".\n\nThis guy is so obnoxious\n\nHe's very humble, especially compared to Madrid and their diva antics\n\nFor answering a question that he was asked? Lmao\n\nAs if Vini isn‚Äôt lmao, the irony\n\nsometimes he is too\n\nClassic Madrista. Real Madrid acts like the most entitled babies ever and when someone says they don't respect it, they cry about their entitlement being called out. At least you're holding down that entitled baby title for as far out as anyone can see because no one can even get close.\n\nIndeed\n\nMan hasn‚Äôt spoken his whole life, now his doing a world tour of press conferences\n\nUsually ballon d'or winners get asked to do interviews\n\nMind blowing, isn't it?\n\nüòÇüòÇüòÇ\n\nNobody does. The Joffrey Lannister of football clubs.\n\nJoffrey was less entitled than the babies of Real Madrid. Plus everyone knew Joffrey was a monster. Real has millions of fans across the world defending them for acting like the biggest spoiled brats ever. Only Cercei defended Joffrey.\n\nI can't respect ballon dor... how about that?\n\nNot sure anyone cares\n\nwell he didnt deserved yes he won the euros but he plays with spain meanwhile in real madrid vini jr is the best player\n\nShut the fuck up already Rodri. I hope City keeps losing the rest of the year just for this. Rodri doesn‚Äôt know when to shut his fucking mouth\n\nWe've seen more of Rodri while behind out for the season than we have of that vini guy. Has anyone seen him? Also where's that Mbappe guy?\n\nDude I'm so jealous of mbappe guy, bro got a special ticket to watch the champions league game from the pitch itself, also got to take a penalty\n\nüòÇ\n\nWaiting for him to fall on his fuckin' head which he inevitably will. All this time off and nothing better to do than talk. Pick up a Playstation controller or something...\n\nExactly. How dare he answers a question in an interview\n\nDidn't you know in interviews you're supposed to silently stare at the interviewer not answering anything\n\nAnd bite your lips and moan\n\nBro he wont shut up\n\nInterviewers won't stop asking him about it\n\nYou know he can also say \"what's done is done. I wouldn't like to talk about it anymore\"\n\nI thought we hated the media trained, faux answers that provide nothing?\n\nMan keeps getting asked for his opinion, and he's giving it. I don't understand the sense of anger from people (unless you're a RM fan, even in that case get the fuck over it. It's YOUR outrage that made this into a story)\n\nRedditors when someone answers a question they're asked. I know you live in your mom's basement and probably don‚Äôt talk to anyone, but it's customary to answer questions when asked. Hope this helps if you ever go outside.\n\nHahaha Redditor makes joke about another redditor living in the basement. You're funny\n\nMost chatty Balon d‚Äôor winner ever."

Madness.\n\nLamal, Mainoo etc weren‚Äôt even born.¬†\n\nCrazy! I know people will say about how poor the Saudi league is which is true, but look at the other top class attacking players that have gone over there, none of them are doing what a 40 year old is doing.\n\nHe‚Äôs outscored Benzema, Neymar and Mahrez (and a few others) combined.¬†\n\nHas Neymar even played? Didnt he get some serious injury?\n\nU mean the kebob to the belly injury?\n\nWell that one got other brazilian greats like ronaldo and dinho so not surprised he's taken the same path lol\n\nRonaldo had a thyroid problem, so it was medical for him.\n\nTbf they rewlly just there for the cash - CR9 only one taking it hard serious\n\nWhy are you saying CR9 when he wore the number 9 for one season and CR7 is an iconic name and brand lol?\n\nfunny little accidents\n\nHey leave my kids out of this\n\nSo she still didn't tell you.\n\nYeah probably. They are in retirement mode whereas Ronaldo doesn‚Äôt do retirement mode .\n\nSaying that like Ronaldo isn't there for the cash lmao\n\nLol .. Is he not getting paid?\n\nLol .. Is he not getting paid?\n\n[removed]\n\nWould still be Utd‚Äôs best attacker lmao\n\nFacts. He wasn't the problem. How many strikers that can score tons of goals actually press? Almost none. Strikers that can press don't end up scoring 25-40 goals in a season.\n\nAs a neutral I just found the scapegoating baffling and I think Ten Hag felt insecure and threatened by Ronaldo‚Äôs status for a variety of reasons.\n\nHe should buy Sporting with his oil money and make a European comeback as player-owner.¬†\n\nYou can't just buy a Portuguese club, since most of them belong to the fans and have elected presidents every 4 years. AVB just became Porto's president in April, but only after a long and difficult election campaign, and for Ronaldo to control Sporting that would've to be his route too.\n\nI blame him. Every player should have told them no.\n\nIt may be that those other guys don‚Äôt give a fuck and are shamelessly collecting a pay cheque . And Ronaldo does give a shit.\n\nOkay? That just makes Ronaldo come across even better.\n\nI wasn‚Äôt criticising either way, it‚Äôs just a factor.\n\nNot really , if he was competitive he‚Äôd stay in Europe but instead went over there to stat pad\n\nI feel like a lot of players don't take it seriously. They just get their bag and put in the bare minimum. I think it's really cool that Ronaldo actually puts his heart and soul into it.\n\nYamal?\n\nI‚Äôd prefer you didn‚Äôt remind me of that game thank you very much\n\n*one of the goals\n\nHe's played a lot of games that one would argue he is more than 39.\n\nDamn yesterdays left foot banger was insane, lot of haters in this sub gonna be pissed lol\n\nAn injection of nostalgia, my god. I remember thinking ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not going in‚Äù and then whattt?\n\nSIUUUU\n\nEmbarrassing\n\nI am not embarrassed random stranger whose opinions I don't care about, SIUUUUUUUU\n\nYou are not Toni kroos üíÄ\n\nIronic\n\nZzzzzzz\n\nNo ones denying his ability, its the rape we hate him for\n\nOf course my friend, we all need to something to hate someone for\n\nlmao what rape? explain it to me\n\nA gift to us!\n\nI, for one, can't wait to see him play.\n\nA gift to himself given by himself. His dedication is impressive, reminds me of Novak Djokovic\n\nI hope he scores lots of goals in the Euros in Germany.\n\nIt really is.\n\nA gift delivered by PED's if we're being honest.\n\nThey‚Äôre all on PEDs. His work ethic should be respected.\n\nHe is still scoring and playing. Most players his age retire. So he is definitely unique in what he has done, is doing and can do for the sport.\n\nKnowing how he is, he will only retire after scoring 1000 goals.\n\n[removed]\n\nWith the exception of the Croatian goat Modric. Back to back World Cup silver, bronze, champions leagues, la liga ‚Ä¶\n\nHe‚Äôs in a retirement league\n\nYeah because him and Messi have achieved everything there is in club football so they both moved to retirement leagues &amp; focus on their international careers.\n\nWho cares? He is outscoring players much younger than him in the same league. Mane, Benzema, Firmino, etc. all play there and they are not doing much.\n\nand still better than any other goalscorer there lol\n\nWhen your in the best team and the closest competition is a championship level striker I think it speaks volumes\n\nWell its not his fault they dropped the bar unlike him, thats why he is exceptional but yall haters will still hate. Brainless hate is awesome üòÉ\n\nWhat? The championship quality striker scored 28 in 28 this year which is only 7 off Ronaldo having played fewer games. The same player whose best Pl season was 14 goals. Oh and how many goals did Ronaldo score in his last season in a real league? 1 in 10.\n\nLmao bruh u wanna pass the salt? Just appreciate greatness it‚Äôs not that complicated. \n\n‚Äúronaldo sucks im so edgy wow‚Äù\n\nGtfo mitrovic is PL quality, hell he would start for chelsea lol\n\nConsidering Chelsea‚Äôs only CF has the injury record of Jack Wilshere I think anyone would start for them.\n\nlet it go man, you‚Äôre just making yourself look like a clown\n\nI'm gonna make damn sure I watch every Portugal game, let me tell you. It's been an honour to watch him and Messi for my entire childhood.\n\nIt‚Äôs a shame that throughout Ronaldo and Messi‚Äôs career the narrative has been dominated by ‚Äòwho is the best. Or who is the GOAT‚Äô which are quite dumb questions. I wish the narrative would have been focussing more on how much of a treat it is to watch them both at the same time, we have been blessed with 2 of the very best players for a sustained decade and a half and they will be sorely missed when they retire. \n\nI‚Äôve got a sneaking suspicion Ronaldo is far from done yet. He‚Äôs mentioned retiring at 42 and I think he will play at the next WC and move to the MLS beforehand. He‚Äôs a perfect fit for a very creative Portugal midfield and will get plenty of service, and as we witnessed against Republic of Ireland he has still got top level finishing\n\nRonaldo ain‚Äôt going to the US brother.\n\nI can see it. He would be an ideal counter to messi for another MLS team. Ticket sales and prices for inter Miami have sky rocketed. Also it will build his profile for after football, and he speaks English which helps.\n\nHe‚Äôd be a great fit for the Vegas team\n\nNo I mean he won‚Äôt enter the US at all.\n\nDid you forget his case?\n\nWasn't it dismissed?\n\nBro thinks it's still 2018\n\nGoogle ‚ÄúRonaldo Las Vegas‚Äù to find out more\n\nThat is exactly the case I was talking about It was dismissed and the appeal was denied. Haven't heard of him having any other legal issue pending in the US.\n\nI googled. Seems like the case got dismissed and he won‚Äôt be detained if he went to US\n\nHe can't get a visa, mate. He literally can't go to the US. Why do you think he went to Saudi?\n\nEdit: I'm only stating neutral facts. Have everyone forgotten about [this? ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/en.as.com/en/2019/03/27/soccer/1553701516_025568.html%3foutputType=amp)\n\nHe wouldn‚Äôt make half of what he makes In Saudi and he‚Äôs not finished as a player yet, that‚Äôs why\n\nAlso the whole thing about Ronaldo being either arrested or taken into questioning upon arriving on US soil. These are facts, and easy to look up. I'm not hating on Ronaldo or anything, I'm merely stating neutral facts. [There's plenty of sources, but here's one. ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/en.as.com/en/2019/03/27/soccer/1553701516_025568.html%3foutputType=amp).\n\nThe case has been dismissed and had been by the point he left United I believe so it wouldn‚Äôt have played a part in not going US\n\nYou might be right, I don't think he has been back to the US since though. I know I wouldn't either way, if I had the money and status that he has. It would just harm his brand, and potentially re-stir up the case again, as well as there still might be a risk for being detained.\n\nI recall that Ronaldo was projected to go the US, and that this case is what a factor in him changing his plans. I might remember it wrong, though.\n\nMoney talks my friend\n\nSo does did his confession\n\nHe‚Äôd rather make money in Saudi than pay it out in the states, not a difficult decision really.\n\nThe case against him was dismissed with prejudice. You're acting as if he's in risk of being arrested if he steps foot into the country.\n\nBelieve it or not, straight to jail\n\nRight to the chair\n\nHe will in 2026. The WC\n\nThe ‚ÄúWho is the GOAT?‚Äù question is what made these two push themselves so hard in the first place though.\n\nIt‚Äôs not been dominated by who‚Äôs the best everyone including Ronaldo fanboys know Messi is the best\n\nYou, boy, have proven that comment true to the fullest extent\n\nIs Pepe at 41 years old a joke to you?\n\nRONNIE, I am for one rooting for you. GET IT DONE BRUH!!!! So that way you can ride off into the sunset\n\nIt truly is, he is in my top 10 favourite players, so it is a pleasure.\n\nhoneslty that man worked fucking hard whis whole life to be able to play at euros at 39 and i can respect that even if im not keen on him\n\nI don't think there's been any player to play in multiple positions and be successful like he has. If you followed his career from the start till now, he has played as a RM, a LM, then a LW then a CF, he really is phenomenal.\n\nIt‚Äôs the places he‚Äôs done it rather than positions IMHO.\n\nHe‚Äôs **dominated** in England, Spain and Italy. Messi only did Spain (his numbers are very average for France).¬†\n\nFootball is about more than numbers though - this discourse can be quite lazy and completely overlooks much of what football is about. \n\nIt‚Äôs a mixture of stats, impact, style of play etc. \n\nGiven Messi was not an out and out forward and not the focal point of that PSG team, his numbers are not ‚Äòaverage‚Äô in the way you are trying to contextualise them. \n\nHe was also extremely unlucky - he hit the woodwork like 16x in his first season. He was second and first in the assists table across the two seasons. His last minute free-kick against Lille was pivotal for the win and the title. \n\nI‚Äôd also argue that Ronaldo didn‚Äôt ‚Äòdominate‚Äô Italy - did you actually watch Juventus during his time there? He was good but he wasn‚Äôt great. The stats are really deceiving considering the position he played and the fact he took pretty much every free kick and penalty available. \n\nEven still, he managed to finish behind Quagliarella and Immobile. The final season when he was top goal scorer they finished 4th‚Ä¶\n\nYou‚Äôre effectively holding Messi loyalty for Barca against him, which is bizarre and an arbitrary point of measure.\n\nHe still won player of the year awards and golden boot in Italy. Messi failed to win anything individually noteworthy in France.\n\nAh Reddit and Messi. What a circlejerk\n\n[deleted]\n\nI mean if that‚Äôs the justification you use to help vindicate your argument, fair enough üòÇ\n\n[deleted]\n\nYes lmao saying Messi hit the woodwork 16x times like Ronaldo or any other player doesn't, are we supposed to count those as goals now? Or a 0.5 goal?\n\n&gt;he really is phenomenal. \n\nIL EST VRAIMENT! \n\nIL EST VRAIMENT! \n\nIL EST VRAIMENT PH√âNOM√âNAL LALALALALALA!!!\n\nTruly the GOAT\n\nHe wasn‚Äôt really successful until he moved to the middle. On the wing he didn‚Äôt do much aside from go sideways.\n\nI strongly disagree, when he played on the wing he was able to stretch the team out and draw out players, he was agile and a really good dribbler which was necessary to playing on the wing as a midfielder, no one really knew how to deal with him. When he moved further up the pitch as a winger that‚Äôs when he became a monster goal scorer.\n\nAgain not really. About a million stepovers and either flop on the floor or go sideways/backwards then swap to the other wing and do the same. Rinse and repeat. He didn‚Äôt start doing much until shrek moved into a false 9 role and ronaldo effectively moved into the centre.\n\nConsidering he won several trophies playing in that position means he was successful in doing what was needed. Not sure if you know what the job description of a LM/RM is supposed to be but it was very different than playing as a forward, cutting in and shooting. When he transitioned into that forward role on the wing that was his best position for the next ten years.\n\nPeople who never actually watched him but say stuff like this is annoying! Ronaldo only moved as a CF in 16/17 under Zidane when he played him and Benzema upfront. Fucking honestly... People act like since about 2009 he was just waiting in the penalty area, when the reality is up until his knee injury slowed his pace down and he lost that extra yard, he was a wide player beating players, but would still score 50+ every year.\n\nI watched him since he debuted in the PL. Maybe you should watch matches rather than a Wikipedia lineup.\n\nWell you clearly didn't because what you are saying is wrong! I mean all the evidence is there on YouTube for people to watch! Loads of his games have been uploaded with English Commentary... Go and watch the ones from 07-15 and you will see that he was a winger. CrixRonnieOfficial is the best channel for it. üëç\n\nAgain maybe try and watch a game rather than a YouTube highlights reel.\n\nWatched nearly all of his Madrid games live because he is my favorite non Everton player mate, I'm telling you to go and watch the videos of his games that have been uploaded so you can see that you are wrong. He was always a winger until he got older, he was just a winger who scored an insane amount of goals.\n\nWhy would I when I‚Äôve watched them the first time around?\n\nWhile clearly sitting on the wrong side of the TV apparantly.\n\nProbably the last. Same for Messi and my cro bro Luka\n\nPepe?\n\nLukaku?\n\nArgentina are in Euros?\n\nCopa‚Ä¶\n\nPeople talk about once in a lifetime players, with Ronaldo I believe it might be once ever. I don't think football will ever see a player like him again.\n\nAlso overlooked but Pepe is in the squad as well, still playing high level football into his 40's. What a player!\n\nI think this time Portugal can win. The mentality Ronaldo is showing before the tournament is different than in the last euros he played.\n\nI don't care about age. All that matters is results. If he is playing well, put him on. Putting youth on a pedestal is a recipe for disaster and why many teams fail.\n\nI follow Aussie Rules football, and there's a team that has been perpetually bad for a long while ever since there was a season they decided to cut all their older players to \"focus on the youth\". It turns out without experience and leadership, it's really hard to win games.\n\nMy üê´ is ageless!\n\nPepe is older\n\nObama is older\n\nwill you start or bench him?\n\nRonaldo is proof that with determination, anything is possible.¬†\n\nI know a lot of fans don't like him, but I really admire him for keeping up his level of fitness and quality that allows him to play at the highest level. In addition, many superstars don't want to keep playing for their national teams as they get older, but he is always there for Portugal.\n\nAs an Argentinian I‚Äôd love to see this beast ending his career with another Euro.\n\nSteroids moment\n\nForgetting Pepe playing at 41\n\nBest play of all time\n\nRonaldo is still one of the best players on the planet even at 39.  \nMbappe being no.1  \nMessi was always overrated.\n\nGrowth hormone is very effective.\n\nMessi is the biggest example of that lmao\n\nWhy do you think he's on that\n\nAnybody else see an old photo and an age in a headline and immediately assume dead.\n\nAnd probably steroids lol\n\nMessi literally takes HGH to this day\n\nCan't wait to see him cry when they get knocked out.\n\nPortugal play better without him. Manager should have been brave and retired him, he doesn‚Äôt play in a competitive league anymore.\n\nNo we don‚Äôt, yesterday was Portugal‚Äôs best performance in the last few matches, and he played and contributed throughout the whole match¬†\n\nAgainst Ireland\n\nBruh you are hating on him throughout this whole comment section. Are you bored?\n\nCR7 lives rent free in his head\n\nBro all these haters be doing the same shit lol it‚Äôs everywhere on the thread they just talk shit\n\nCr7 living in your head rent free. \n\nGo outside.\n\nits a curse for Portugal international team.\n\nHe needs to retire before he became a villain\n\nYou‚Äôre active in the Man City sub just don‚Äôt speak\n\nNo retirement. We‚Äôre taking CR41 to World Cup 2026. That‚Äôs just how it will go.\n\nPortugal can‚Äôt win with him on the pitch.\n\nThe greatest #2 player to ever do it.\n\nThat's ronaldinho"

    "all_comment_text": "Not English but when I watch this squad I think there is simply too much talent to be as ‚Äòbad‚Äô as they‚Äôve been. England haven‚Äôt won much in the last 60 years, and his finishes have been OK. But I think it‚Äôs fair to question if they‚Äôve been as good as they should have been.¬†\n\nTruthfully I think England‚Äôs talent is the only reason they continue to finish as deep as they have under Southgate. Like they win in spite of him, not because of him.¬†\n\nand also to add, OP's explanation of England's results is also not good enough for what is supposed to be a big team. you can't just say \"it's ok they lost because the other team was good\". no, the whole point of a tournament is that everyone is good once you get towards the final. a \"big\" team needs to be able to beat good competition. saying shit like \"it's ok because we lost to the team that (almost) won the tournament\" is just what losers tell to each other to feel a little better.\n\nExactly. The two losses were to aging Croatia and Italian teams that we should have been able to beat. In both games we didn't do enough, sat back and got punished. Southgate simply doesn't have the tactical nous to be able to deal with this.\n\nCroatia in 2018 weren‚Äôt really ‚Äúaging‚Äù\n\nCroatia in 2021 were aging\n\n[deleted]\n\n[deleted]\n\n2018 was not an ‚Äúaging‚Äù Croatia team\n\nI would argue a better coach would have won both of those games.  Southgate has no clue what to do against teams that are good and can‚Äôt make in game changes.  As a US can I love it but I feel the same about our coach :(\n\n\"France almost won the tournament\" = after they beat England, they also beat Morocco.\n\nExactly this. The general consensus is that we have a team full of starts and play so negatively, I for one can‚Äôt stand Southgate, he is absolutely stealing a living. Had a Ferrari and drives it like a Skoda. I honestly think replacing him with anyone else would be an improvement. Source - English.\n\nPretty telling that Kane said in his post-match interview that ‚Äúwe need to be better at pressing, we don‚Äôt know what each of us should be doing‚Äù. Southgate has had far too long to not have imprinted on this team.\n\nIn fairness he‚Äôs changed how they defend, we used to play a low block and counter but as the quality of player has increased we‚Äôve added the high press to our repertoire.\n\nIt‚Äôs not much of a high press though. Everything about it was risky. Also zero transition play tactics makes it nearly impossible for this team to win a tournament without moments of magic/luck every game.\n\nThat‚Äôs more about the intensity of it. Kane is clearly not fit and Bellingham also looks tired. We have more than enough quality to give them a rest\n\nDoesn't a high press require us to actually, you know, press?\n\nMate‚Ä¶ put some respect on the 1997 Le Tournoi!\n\nThat Roberto Carlos free kick. Ooooff.\n\nEngland haven't won *anything* in the last 60 years.¬†\n\n\nFTFY.\n\nHey come on, the 1966 world cup was 58 years ago\n\nAnd I‚Äôm 57 years old fml¬†\n\nSo it‚Äôs all your fault?\n\nEverything‚Äôs always my fault, just ask my mother lol\n\nLe Tournoi, never forget Le glorious Tournoi!\n\nErr I think you‚Äôll find that they won Le Tournoi, friend! That was a year before France ‚Äò98 so by my calculation that makes it worth 75% of a World Cup!\n\nWorth more if anything. Eight countries have won the World Cup. Only one has won Le Tournoi!\n\noil sand cover friendly faulty heavy lock flag absurd tub\n\n *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev/home)*\n\nSpurs **still** have the Carling Cup from 2007.\n\n\n\nEngland üè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å•Û†ÅÆÛ†ÅßÛ†Åø national Football ‚öΩÔ∏è  Team have zero accolades in tournaments consisting if 5 or more than 5 teams after the 1966 world cup.\n\n&gt; I watch this squad I think there is simply too much talent to be as ‚Äòbad‚Äô as they‚Äôve been\n\nThe same could be said of every England squad since Keegan left. If it was just Southgate then maybe it'd be a fair argument.\n\n2018 squad says hi‚Ä¶..\n\nThat's the sentiment you'll find from us English. How we've done in tournaments is due to the players, and not Southgate.\n\nSouthgate is good for England when he deals with the media and has generally fostered a good environment for the team.  His actual coaching and tactics is suspect to say the least.\n\nIts fare to say Southgate is shit manager. With all that talent you have got you are still fighting for a point and not clinical enough. Literally said he doesn't have a natural replacement for Kalvin Phillips, WTF ?? He has got a team full of stars but he just can't manage them. No offence but, as a neutral fan its just boring to watch England play at this point.\n\nHe‚Äôs got the most talented generation of football players any manager has had to work with yet he plays highly defensive anti-football.\n\nThis team should be smashing in 3 or 4 goals a game but he prefers to play sideways and sitting back with 10 men behind the ball after scoring a goal.¬†\n\nSouthgate, you‚Äôre not managing Everton in their annual relegation fight. You‚Äôre managing an elite team who should be winning trophies.¬†\n\nThe correct answer. He is utterly tactically inept. He does not understand his job, the game, or his players. He is wasting a generation of players talented enough to perhaps win a tournament or two. \n\nHe's good at one thing: making excuses. His frankly bizarre Kalvin Phillips comment after today's game should reveal all. Phillips played just how Southgate did, and wants - fearful, conservative, slow, sideways, performative football. He's a fraud latched on to by the FA because of their own self inflicted blunders and FA-first approach. He wouldn't deserve a job in the English second tier, based on merit. He couldn't win a participation trophy.\n\nHe's a dead, lead weight. He makes Graham Taylor look like Gusztav Sebes or Rinus Michels.\n\nDidn't he lead Boro to relegation?\n\nLol and then the FA decided to hire him for the national team.\n\nUtterly shambolic stuff.\n\nYep. His entire club management experience was 3 years at Middlesborough.\n\nConfounding stuff there from the FA.\n\nmindless squeamish hat fanatical upbeat drunk domineering gaze attractive unite\n\n *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev)*\n\nHe was simply in the right place at the right time. We were at a particularly low point after Hodgson‚Äôs  awful tenure culminated in that Iceland embarrassment. Then the whole Big Sam debacle.\n\nYes. A Boro team that had just got to a European final with a lot of investment particularly up front and he couldn‚Äôt keep them up against our shambles of a squad at the time, after we decided to play half a season without a manager at all after Roy Keane left\n\nWell technically he was appointed England U21ms coach and then got the senior job as interim coach after Big Sam‚Äôs scandal. He did well enough at the time to get the gig full time.\n\nhe had one of the best u21 teams weve ever had and guess how many trophies he won.\n\nhe went in with the top-seeded team and finished bottom of the group in the qualifying round.\n\n\"He did well enough at the time to get the gig full time.\"\n\nThat's the major mistake right there.\n\nHe was dire at Middlesbrough. As soon as it got announced he was getting the England job we all collectively shuddered here in Teesside.\n\nRay Parlour says this on his autobiography.  He went to Middlesbrough,  was still playing to very high standard and Southgate was made manager for his 2nd season there. \n\nSouthgate got up himself , told everyone not to be too familiar and call him boss or gaffer. \n\nParlour joking asked if they could call him big nose. \n\nSouthgate dropped him to the reserves . \n\nWhat a fucking humourless , useless fucking cunt that man is. I hate watching his anti-football. Can't wait for us to crash out if it means that's the last we see of that bignosed prick.\n\nYeah they were apparently good pals when Southgate was playing but then got the manager job and became the fun sponge we all know and hate now\n\nHe's been a colossal underachiever.\n\nHe was involved in the national setup, and was given the job on a caretaker basis after the Sam Allardyce debacle.  It just so happened early results meant he was offered the job permanently.\n\nNational and club football management require totally different skill sets. People forget the state of the England team prior to GS, players didn‚Äôt want to play or played reluctantly whereas now there is a real togetherness. His record is second only to Sir Alfs.\n\nBecause we have had some of the best talent England's ever had. Context is everything and winning a few games because Stirling is a master st drawing penalties and Kane is one of the best at slotting them away makes those stats look better than the reality suggests.\n\nAlso, we‚Äôve had some pretty favourable draws in tournaments. Both the World Cup in 2018, and the Euros in 2021 we didn‚Äôt have a knockout match against a good side until the ones we lost. \n\nIt was also true in 2022, but getting to the quarters and losing is pretty much what England have historically done.\n\nYeah this reminds me a lot of the Belgium team from several years ago with prime hazard, KDB, lukaku, mertens, etc. incredible talent that the manager could never put together coherently to win a major trophy. Hopefully the FA don‚Äôt make the same mistake the Belgians did.\n\nMartinez wasn't a special manager. He kept Wigan up for a few years on a limited budget so he is competent. He kept Everton mid table and did alright but never excelled. He was lucky to get the Belgian job\n\nWon Wigan an FA cup tbf. Definitely achieved a hell of a lot more than Southgate\n\nDidn‚Äôt they win that the same year they got relegated as well? That‚Äôs a tough bit of a silverware to attain under corcumstances\n\nDid a great job at Swansea too. Transformed the club from nobodies to one of the most likeable PL small clubs with a recognisable and attractive identity/style.\n\nIt was probably a mistake to think he could play that brand of football at international level, the players don‚Äôt get the time together as at a club.\n\nAfter Portugal, I hope he gets England's job, so he can ruin 3 golden generations.¬†\n\nPortugal have the best XG. At least we would score some fucking goals.\n\nSame reason Portugal won't win it this time around, Martinez is far too weak to bench Ronaldo.\n\nI couldn't believe my eyes when Bernardo Silva broke into the box and tried to square it to the penalty spot for Ronaldo instead of having a shot, but that's the Ronaldo effect.\n\nWe all remember when Santos dropped Ronnie and his replacement Ramos scored a hattie in a WC R16 match..\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbE96IMB9Vw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbE96IMB9Vw)\n\nTo be honest Bernardo did that because he does not have a right foot , of course accommodating Ronaldo in the starting eleven is a complex problem but there are more in this team like benching Bernardo Rafael le√£o , Vitinha should be the midfield leader and the coach places him in the last spot in the hierarchy ( look how he was the best player yet Bernardo Bruno and Ronaldo didn‚Äôt left the pitch ) which full backs to play , is Pepe going to be good to play next to Ruben the entire tournament ? 3 at the back or 2 ? There are so many tactical questions that Martinez does not know the answer ..\n\nIts difficult to bench Ronaldo. If he was benched and Portugal lost,  the Portuguese press would claim that was the reason. The manager would be eviscerated.\n\nYeah, the Portugal job is a poisoned chalice and will be until Ronaldo retires. The only ‚Äúavailable‚Äù (if reports about the break clause in his contract are to be believed) manager with enough star power and authority to be able to bench Ronaldo without significant repercussions would be Mourinho.\n\nA manager with a stronger CV would have the authority to make big decisions.\n\nRonaldo would have a temper tantrum if Martinez dropped him.\n\nYeah, that was my point. Needs to be a manager who has been there and won it all, but the problem is there are a very small pool of managers who fit that criteria. Mourinho is likely the only one of them who‚Äôd be interested in managing Portugal, and he supposedly has a break clause in his Fenerbache contract to allow him to leave if they come calling.\n\nThe reaction of the media and others should play no part in the decision-making process of the manager.\n\nThat's a weak mentality.\n\nDo you remember the next game where they played Morocco, and had to bring ramos off at half time because he was so ineffective? One good game doesn't make him a world class striker and he hasn't exactly lit it up at psg\n\nRonaldo was introduced in the 51st min to minimal effect as well.\n\nThat was a match where the entire team struggled, rather than Ramos being the sole culprit.\n\nAside from that, my main point is that the team are more cohesive without Ronaldo.\n\nI‚Äôm a Leeds fan so very familiar with the way Philips played for the club.\n\nDefinitely a lynch pin of a team but never overly defensive, could rely on him to clear up before the ball getting through to the defence but was never afraid of getting the ball forward.¬†\n\nPhilips for England a completely different style.¬†\n\nHaving seen a lot of his club games for you guys, I'd agree he was a positive in that role, but that Bielsa team wasn't exactly cowardly or conservative. I don't think KP himself is the player we see for England, only, and clearly his career has gone to hell after the City move, which likely failed so miserably because he lacks the intelligence to play for Pep. \n\nSouthgate has ironically probably greatly limited KP's potential career, too. All the same,  KP is a great case study on what Southgate is as a manager or coach. He's bad for his own players.\n\nBielsa is a perfect example to show what happens when you have the right manager to get the best out of this team.¬†\n\nBefore Bielsa KP would never have even crossed England selectors mind. Post Bielsa KP and he‚Äôs not good enough.¬†\n\nComplete fantasy scenario as Bielsa would never get on with the FA but if he was England manager we would be rivalling Germany and Brazil for number of trophies.¬†\n\nYeah Bielsa wouldn‚Äôt played a 4 man defence with two holding mids and Kane-Foden-Bellingham who just all stand in the 10 area and trip over each other‚Äôs feet.\n\nDisagree. To play the way Bielsa does requires a level of understanding and practice that can only come from training at the frequency club sides do. Like it or not, the strategy of being tough to beat and win with set pieces/counter/individual brilliance is how France, Italy and Portugal amongst others have achieved success. It‚Äôs much easier to coach defensive solidity than free flowing attacking football when you only get the players for 6/7 weeks a year.\n\nWell, we can see whether your theory works in Uruguay's performance at Copa America. Bielsa is still revered in Chile for transforming their national team so I don't think his tactics are limited only to sides that frequently train together.\n\nHis Chile side were excellent! Although Jorge Sampaoli got the balance between attack and defence even better\n\nHe wasn‚Äôt Yorkshire Pirlo for nothing.\n\nIdk why people act like KP was always some overly defensive player, unless they only watched him for England post-City. Just look at Rice for Arsenal vs Rice for England now‚Ä¶\n\nThis comment rings true so much. I was thinking that when he eventually leaves, what his next step would be? Because I couldn‚Äôt see any club in England willing to give him a job.\n\nWell his win rate at Middlesborough - his last job before this - when they were in the Championship was like 31%. \n\nDude‚Äôs a fraud.\n\nAnd by contrast, Sunderland stayed up at Middlesbroughs expense that season and we didn‚Äôt employ a manager after Keane left in November. That‚Äôs how bad Southgate was\n\nThe fact that United truly considered him to replace Ten Hag is hilarious to me\n\nAmen. With the talk from INEOS it still wouldn't shock me if they did an about face in July and take him on after a dull, pulseless exit in the round of 16 or 1/4 final. That would add a decade to United's possible recovery time, to get back into the top 4. So, it's not all negative?\n\nAnd to give some context to OP‚Äôs post about Southgate‚Äôs success:\n\n2018 WC - We had a group of Belgium, Panama, Tunisia. Beat the weak two, lost to Belgium, finished 2nd. Knockouts we scraped past Columbia on pens, beat a washed Sweden, lost to Croatia. So we lost as soon as we played a good team.\n\n2020 Euros - We had a group of Scotland, Croatia, and Czech Republic. Topped the group. Knockouts we beat a poor Germany, Ukraine, and Denmark (which took a last minute pen that was saved but fell kindly to Kane for a tap in), before losing to Italy.\n\nSo yeah Southgate has got us further than other manager has but he‚Äôs had two ridiculously easy runs (easiest by FAR of any big team) and he‚Äôs had one of the strongest squads to do it with.\n\nAnd as the comment above says, he plays this awful defensive negative football, cannot manage a game with any kind of sustained dominance or momentum, and frankly he‚Äôs tactically inept. He fails to adjust his teams to what the opposition are doing, and loves a defensive 4-2-3-1 where we hamstring the majority of our attacking quality in favour of this awful clean sheet football.\n\nHe‚Äôs a failed Championship manager and shouldn‚Äôt be the England boss. Even other countries - Germany and Italy I know have had it in their newspapers - say Southgate is wasting England‚Äôs brilliant squad with awful negative football.\n\nEdit: The German paper was Bild, and the Italian paper was La Gazzetta. Both massive papers in their countries, and both absolutely shit on Southgate, and have done during this Euros already.\n\n\"losing to Italy\" doesn't do it justice. Scoring early, then sitting back and allowing them to shit all over us is what happened. Should have smashed them. It was painful to watch at the time and he should have been clearing his desk immediately after for bottling that opportunity. I remember anyone suggesting that at the time was hounded out by the \"we did well to reach a final. Poor guys who took the penalties\". Even a bit of race card played as I remember.\n\nYeah I didn‚Äôt want to go there but you‚Äôre right. Playing 2 holding against Italy and giving them freedom of the park was criminal.\n\nMancini makes two changes and Southgate‚Äôs head just falls off.\n\nWe didn‚Äôt have a shot on target after shaws goal in the second minute. 118 minutes without a shot on target. Unbelievable.\n\nIt looked like England were going to absolutely thump Italy until the first goal. Then they just stopped playing.\n\nDon‚Äôt forget the fact he then went on to lose to Belgium AGAIN in the 3rd place playoff in 2018 ü§£\n\nAnd he couldn‚Äôt even beat the sweaties in 2020\n\nTbf that Belgium team was its strongest ever\n\nHe struggles against big teams that can attack better.\n\nTbf Kane wasted that goal against Croatia that woulda sent us through. Still imprinted in my brain, and I cant remember shit.\nAlso, side step, declan rice was absolute atrocious yesterday\n\nDon‚Äôt know about Southgate tactics but Denmark are a solid side. Thrashings like that don‚Äôt happen on the regular anymore. Even Canada can lose ‚Äúonly‚Äù 2-0 to Argentina.\n\nFrom the match, the most worrying thing about England is not that they didn‚Äôt demolish Denmark, but rather the fact that they seemed like the weaker side for most of the match.\n\nIt's more that they should be coming away from games thinking \"we could have scored 3-4\".¬†\n\n\nWith the talent england has, they should at least be dictating most games rather than looking pretty average.¬†\n\n\nLast night's game is a prime example, score a goal and then try and shut up shop. Why? They were more than capable of trying to go for a second or more, but they let Denmark back in the game by playing like they were the underdog holding on for an upset 1-0.¬†\n\neven before the goal denmark were dictating play in the middle.\n\nbut then that will happen when you have a RB at CM, a RB at LB, a 10 at LW and an 8 at 10\n\nYeah I've seen people talking about Denmark like they're San Marino and we should be absolutely pummelling them. They have a really solid squad of players! My concern though was how little we troubled them, was only expecting us to win by 1 goal but we barely made their keeper work at all.\n\nWith Kane, Saka, Bellingham &amp; Foden you'd expect them to make a few more saves at least, not just lump it forward over and over. So frustrating to watch.\n\nYeah Denmark are a solid team, in that kind of second tier of European teams where they consistently qualify for tournaments and are fairly solid, like Switzerland.\n\nAnd, unlike England, they've actually won the Euros once.\n\nLike Denmark, Canada aren‚Äôt terrible either.\n\nIt‚Äôs a talented team, not the most talented team to ever grace the game of football. The current England squad is good but not great enough to score 3-4 goals against most opponents they face. \n\nSouthgate is definitely not pushing them to their full potential though and that‚Äôs what the fans have a problem with. But it‚Äôs delusion to think the current England squad will destroy most teams with 3-4 goals.\n\nIt‚Äôs like this with every manager we have. Bobby Robson got the same treatment throughout his tenure.\n\nI don‚Äôt give a flying fuck that we play defensive football because pragmatic football does win tournaments. But southgate hasn‚Äôt got a fucking clue how to coach a team. Setting up defensively doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt oass the ball forward or have movement in your front line to create space. We‚Äôre the only team i‚Äôve ever seen that retains its defensive shape in possession of the ball. The bloke has done some good things for the team but is completely tactically inept unfortunately and has wasted 8 years.\n\nEverton fan here, and you're right, but it's probably worse than you described as dyche actually has us playing better than England did last game.\n\nIt's everton under lampard. No press but playing with a high line, no plan in attack, wants the players to just \"go and play\".\n\nMaybe the players just aren't as good as we think they are? And English players get undue hype compared to foreign players. England fans are so arrogant.\n\nBeen like this for at least 20 years. I remember whinging about how they could have won in 2008* when they didn't even qualify. The other countries do not matter--it is all up to the English.\n\n* edit. It all blurs together after a while.\n\nThis is it. We have such amazing players who are performing at elite levels - Saka, Rice, Bellingham, Kane yet he‚Äôs just happy with a 1-0 score and with these tactics it often leads to a draw.\n\nYou live  in an illusion if you think in football you can score 3 or 4 goals a game. They're not even as talented as you're mentioning. You fall into what the media wants you to so some people can generate money. It is not an elite squad, buddy. England did the best they could and achieved what they should have achieved being in the position they are. Move on. Wake up\n\nLol the english always think they should be winning every match by ‚Äú3 or 4 goals‚Äù despite havent winning anything in 50 years.\n\nI'm no Southgate fan but this isn't even the most talented England team of the last 20 years, let alone \"any manager has had to work with\".\n\nAshley Cole, Sol Campbell, John Terry, Gary Neville, Scholes Gerrard Lampard Beckham Rooney Owen. That's the EURO 2004 team. You seriously think this current crop is better than that? Which of the current players walks in to that team, out of interest? I'd generously say Kane for Owen, Jude has potential to be an all time great for sure but i'd currently take Gerrard over him (I'm a United fan). Walker over Neville maybe, but the younger generation forget how sick GNev was.\n\nJust my two penneth, cos I see this argument made a lot. I genuinely don't think this current crop of players is all that, I think we're just blinded by PL and receny bias.\n\nI‚Äôve been shouting this into the void a lot for the past few years. The ‚Äògolden generation‚Äô was decorated with trophies galore for their clubs and embarrassed themselves repeatedly on the world stage. Didn‚Äôt even qualify for Euro ‚Äò08 which is unthinkable in the Southgate era. He is done after this tournament and we will need to go in a different direction to get to the next level but people have short memories.\n\nI think anyone who says this is the best squad of England players must be pretty young, and can only mean \"best squad that I have seen\".\n\n\nThe list of players you shared really helps illustrate the point. And don't forget we have Pickford in goal - Pickford! And until the euros, our key central defender was Harry Maguire. Golden generation? No chance.¬†\n\nThe \"golden generation\" was fucking hopeless apart from a few games in 2004.\n\nI'm not debating that, I'm saying that was a better collection of players than the current crop. Do you disagree?\n\nFor all the talent on the pitch I hated watching them even more than current Southgate England. Everyone just looked like they didn't want to be on the pitch with each other but the managers were too scared to drop anyone. Rooney for example scored a lot in qualifying but other than 2004 he was absolutely useless in Euros &amp; World Cups.\n\nEveryone in this thread talking about 2004 like it isn't 20 years ago\n\nYes and no. We‚Äôve got an incredibly talented squad but we are missing one or two key types of players that make the best teams.\n\nWe don‚Äôt really have a metronome, pace-setting centre midfielder ala Busquets, Jorginho, Kroos, Rodri\n\nWe also don‚Äôt have a really creative passer from central. I think that‚Äôs what is behind the horrible TAA experiment. \n\nYou can live without one of those, but we‚Äôre trying to live without both. Can‚Äôt expect 3-4 goals a game with that void in the team.\n\nThis isn‚Äôt a Southgate apology by the way, I think he‚Äôs well past his time now. Just that we need to be cautious about how good our team *really* is.\n\nYou have Mainoo who is in the mould of players you mentioned in 2nd paragraph. He is a gem sitting on bench and we already know he can go toe to toe with the best and have strong mentality.\n\nYeah, he‚Äôs worth a try. I don‚Äôt think we already know he can go toe to toe with the best. He‚Äôs played in a very poor team for one season, hasn‚Äôt played in top tier European competitions etc.\n\nDefinitely worth a try but ‚Äòin the mould of‚Äô is markedly different to being in the same league as the guys I mentioned. \n\nI just feel the team isn‚Äôt reaching maturity at the right time for this comp, especially as it comes to midfield talent.\n\nSee I think Wharton is that metronomic pace setting midfielder. The Jorginho to play alongside Rice. Idea being that we play similarly to Arsenal, with Bellingham (or Palmer or Foden) playing as a better Odegaard.\n\nAlternatively Bellingham could play as a number 8, providing the runs and progressive passing from deep. \n\nTrent would work too - either as an inverting right back (with Walker left back) giving us midfield dominance and giving him more time and space to play his passes or as a midfielder in a team with more width (Gordon left and a left footed left back who can overlap) and depth (Watkins or Kane but not dropping deep).\n\nEngland are NOT an elite team. Maybe in the eyes of the the fans and English media but we hype up players from this country way too much when the reality is we're just not that good. We don't have technical players. We have a bunch of athletes or pace and power merchants. Where our are mavericks? our Musiala's? our Lamal's? The closest thing we have to an actual maverick player was sitting on the bench and didn't come on yesterday. I watched Spain and Italy yesterday and the technical ability on show was on another level. Every player on that pitched seemed comfortable on the ball as if the ball was an extension of them. We don't have that an never will. We hype Bellingham but he's an athlete and a box crasher. He's NOT techy. England are not techy and never have been.\n\nI agree except the point on the best crop  of players ever. England was far better 02-06 and that‚Äôs before, we take in to account other nations. They aren‚Äôt even the most talented team at this tournament\n\n\"should be smashing in 3 or 4 goals a game\". Do you actually watch football? No team on the planet scores 3 or 4 goals every game at the highest level. Only a14 year old who only plays FIFA would have an attitude like this. Completely deluded.\n\n3-4 every single game is obviously unrealistic, but that‚Äôs what we should be *aiming* for against the weaker opponents. Spain beat Croatia 3-0 and Italy 1-0. Germany 5-1 to Scotland and 2-0 to Hungary. Meanwhile England‚Ä¶ 1-0 to Serbia and 1-1 to Denmark.\n\nThere‚Äôs a vast difference when you look at the stats, too. \n\nSpain vs Croatia ‚Äî 11 shots, 5 on target. \nSpain vs Italy ‚Äî 20 shots, 9 on target.\n\nGermany vs Scotland ‚Äî 20 shots, 10 on target.\nGermany vs Hungary ‚Äî 19 shots, 7 on target)\n\nMeanwhile:\n\nEngland vs Croatia ‚Äî 5 shots, 3 on target. \nEngland vs Denmark ‚Äî 12 shots, 4 on target (and that‚Äôs a game where we were drawing and trying desperately for a winning goal for an hour ‚Äî unlike Spain vs Croatia where Spain got 3 goals in the first half and could then shut up shop). \n\nYes, this is a small sample size, and no, 3-4 goals *every* game isn‚Äôt realistic. But scoring three goals in a game (especially against teams like Serbia) shouldn‚Äôt be unattainable. These players are capable of doing it, but Southgate tactically isn‚Äôt enabling them to.\n\nThe point isn‚Äôt that England should score 4 goals a game. The point is that they don‚Äôt try to even score 2. PLEASE watch Germany or Spain play a match and look at the difference in play. Southgate has some of the best offensive players in the world playing a desperateley defensive style that you would usually see from a team like Montenegro or Cyprus\n\nThe thing that gets me as well is I thought he had changed after that Hungary game. He‚Äôs just proven he can not change how he wants them to play, which is a sign of a bad manager. You look at the squad and the weakness is definitely the defence. Yet he wants to use that the most apparently, our weakness. Instead of using our best assets which are clearly the attackers. The guy is utterly bonkers. I don‚Äôt even care if we somehow miraculously win the euros I still want him out\n\nHe couldn't keep Everton up. Actually, there's a lot better teams than Everton that he would get relegated.\n\nHe's only England manager because of how his predecessor left. He was the only manager who would say yes.\n\nMost talented generation? When are people going to stop saying this?\n\nShould be winning trophies is a bit of a stretch mate. England is behind at least 4 other teams. You are absolutely correct about south gates brand of football though.\n\nHe manages like Wagner did at Norwich last season ü§£\n\n‚ÄúHe‚Äôs got the most talented generation of football players any manager has had to work with‚Äù\n\nNow let‚Äôs get real for a second. It‚Äôs not even the best generation of English players.\n\nAnd top of my head I could give some Brazil, France and Spain squads that were light years above.\n\nOr maybe the English team just isn‚Äôt as talented as their fans seem to think.\n\nNot sure how old you are but I've been hearing this about every England squad since the early 1990s. I'm not convinced it's wholly a Southgate problem because I've repeatedly witnessed the same levels of expectations vs achievement every single time.\n\nfucking insane thing to say by someone who clearly never watched us under Capello/Hodgson/McClaren. What international side is smashing in 3 or 4 goals a game. so stupid.\n\nThis is what England fans say about every era. Oh the 80s were a golden team with linekar and shilton and blah blah with all this talent and then oh 90s with shearer and gazza blah blah and then Beckham and owen and Gerrard lampard Rooney blah blah blah. We have an overinflated idea of how good the TEAM is. The individual players might do well at their respective clubs but it does not mean they will gel together as a system. Always blaming the manager instead of the setup from the fa that gives the England setup the least time of the big euro teams with his players but also the players and their relationship with the national team that means they go off half cocked. Bellingham is not going to get the same from England as real Madrid so he's got to start playing like he understands that's. Same with kane. Etc etc etc. play to the team around you and the plan not what you think. If you think it should be different discuss and work on that in the training ground don't just ignore the plan on the pitch. Dropping deeper and deeper and deeper is not southgates fault if he is telling them not to from the sidelines and from training but they fucking ignore him. Players have to take responsibility. Acting like it's champ man here.\n\nHe does not have ‚Äúthe most talented generation of football players any manager has had to work with‚Äù. \n\nBy all means make an argument that picks Southgate apart but don‚Äôt base it on nonsense comments like the above.\n\nYou guys are really overestimating that talent. Sure, you guys have a lot of great players, but so do Germany (their midfield of Wirtz, Musiala, Gundogan and Kroos is miles ahead of Rice, Bellingham, Foden), France, Spain, Brazil, Argentina, Portugal,...\n\nIf you look at some English media it's like they sometimes forget that people play football outside the Premier League. \n\nFor the teams he has had, I feel like he has overperformed a bit, albeit with very boring play.\n\n[removed]\n\nImagine having all the power-ups in your inventory when facing a boss and yet you still choose to scrape by just blocking his attacks and getting a few lucky hits when the boss fight would have been over hours ago had you used any power-ups.\n\nThat's what Southgate is doing with the English team.\n\nThat's what everyone does though. Can't use them, you might need them later.\n\nCame here to say this. I hoard all my items just in case then finish the game with tons of items haha\n\nReddit moment\n\nNo, this is more like slightly overleveling the boss, so you decide you are too lazy to dodge attacks or try any tactics and just expect to go through anyway.\n\nBecause his tactics suck. This is a guy who has simply, as a coach, never performed at a high level. His squad is studded with elite players like Kane, Foden, Alexander-Arnold, Saka, Walker, Rice and so on and he scraped to the finals of the Euros 3 years ago playing essentially home games half the tournament and playing with 7 defensive players in his starting lineup.\n\nNow yesterday he started complaining that he hasn't found an appropriate replacement in his squad for Kalvin Phillips- infamous Manchester City flop Kalvin Phillips, who kept being called up for England despite essentially playing 0 minuted for City, not even making the bench -who symbolises the thoroughly mid playing style of Southgate.\n\nNow, I am not from England, but apart from their national team always being extremely scrutinized in England itself, these are some reasons I can imagine England fans hating Southgate.\n\nThat's so stupid, like, c'mon. Why is he asking for kalvin phillips when he has upgraded version on his arsenal?\n\n\n\nWatched the vid, and i'm literally shocked that my mouth was wide open when i heard it.\n\n\n\nAnd his midfielders, idk why, but it's not working. Last game vs denmark i see only foden mostly roaming the midfield to keep the ball moving, doing that leaving the left side open, closing an option when building up plays.\n\n\n\n\nImo trent and bellingham in the mid is not working, he has to try something else, maybe giving cole palmer a chance, or maybe starts eze in the mid, idk. Fuck reputation, try to bench bellingham or TAA as long as it works. Reputation means shit when they don't work on your tactic\n\nTrent in the mid would have a chance of working but not with these tactics. We've seen he loves to switch the play with those long diagonal balls, but Southgate chooses to play foden on the \"left\" who instead plays mostly through the middle. Trent thrives on movement and runners in the attack but Southgate ball has the whole team basically static. Then when Southgate finally plays some runners in Eze, Bowen and Watkins, where Trent would theoretically thrive, he's already off the pitch by this point. Southgate is just getting it all wrong when it comes to integrating him.\n\nHis signature at Liverpool. Robertson does the same. Has worked beautifully before. I remember a few years ago when we handled city. Those long diagonals all day\n\nBellingham should not be on the number 10 position. There are just too many odd choices here. Kalvin Phillips is extremely mid. Foden is not a left winger. Alexander-Arnold hasn't been a midfielder since age 19. Palmer is, like you said, criminally underused. Southgate just doesn't have the insight to coach at this level. People praise the \"solid\" performances of England even though they should be the worldwide number 1.\n\nBellingham needs to be played as number 8. After all it's his position, yes he's played at number 10 this season and done well but he's going to be back at 8 next season to allow mbappe to take the 10 slot. Play foden as number 10 which is his natural position and I think we'd see improvements.\n\nMbappe is not going to be playing as a 10 at Madrid lmao\n\n‚ÄòNever performed at a high level‚Äô \n\nThis, I think it stems from the fact that he got the job because he ticks a load of boxes that aren‚Äôt necessarily football related. He has done well tbf but due to his lack of winning pedigree fans will always think someone else could do a better job unless he flat out wins something.\n\nIf you're going to play this negative you had better fucking win. \n\nWe're used to not winning titles but it could at least be fun to watch while doing it.\n\nThis is the thing about negativity, it's so ugly only getting the trophy will justify it.\n\nHe's got Kane, Watkins, Bellingham, saka, Foden, Palmer, Gordon, Bowen, Eze at his disposal. That's 2 line ups worth of sensational young attacking talent.\n\nWe limp results. Our last 3 games we haven't managed to score more than 1 goal a game. None of our opponents were *that* strong.\n\nIt would be nice to score goals, sure, but I think we all just want to see better football. The talent we have!!!\n\nhes so focused on having the best 11 players out there, he forgets he needs the best team.\n\ni dont understand how he doesnt bench one of foden/bellingham, and use them as rotation or like for like replacements when one of them isnt firing.\n\nsame for kane - have watkins start a game and run the defence ragged, then bring kane on to get that yard ahead and poach once theyre tired.\n\nits a bloody tournament; you have a squad. keep people fresh and have a plan B\n\nThe fact Toney, Gordon and Palmer haven‚Äôt played at all yet considering two games in a row now it hasn‚Äôt been working is honestly stupid. It feels like Palmer and Toney are just there for penalties, not that we‚Äôre going to get any at this rate. Added to the fact you‚Äôve got Foden and Trippier playing out of their natural positions too.\n\nThe tactics that he is employing are not working at all. He fails to win when it matters most.\n\nIt‚Äôs not just the defensive park-the-bus tactics. His lineups are pretty weak and he obviously heavily favors certain players even when they have shown themselves to be in terrible form (or utterly useless in the given formations). He also lets extremely talented players waste away on the bench, or at home lol(I cannot understand how Grealish barely got any playing time in the last two tournaments, and isn‚Äôt with the team this year)\n\nAdditionally the offense right now looks dreadful. The only person actually bringing creativity and energy seems to be Jude Bellingham.\n\nBecause he plays boring, safe, scared football.¬†\n\nWe‚Äôve got amazing attacking players and he is obsessed with shit, stereotypical ‚ÄúEnglish‚Äù football.¬†\n\nI can‚Äôt remember the last time watching an England game was enjoyable.¬†\nWe‚Äôve done well in some tournaments but pretty much all those games have been tense and frustrating to watch.¬†\n\nSaka, Bellingham, Foden‚Ä¶ and we don‚Äôt get to see them play because he cannot build an attacking team.¬†\n\nIt's not even stereotypical English football. That would be playing 4-4-2 and pumping high balls up at a decent tempo and being a team of hard bastards. He's way more influenced by Simeone's style with a quarter of the managerial talent to make it work.\n\nCome on, that‚Äôs out of order. Southgate hasn‚Äôt got 1/100th of the managerial talent of Simeone.\n\nIt's frustrating watching other international teams play with more tactical nouse than us with less talented players such as the likes of Austria. Southgate has done a fine job building this England team to where they are but a lot of people feel that more can still be done.\n\nI mean if you look at how they‚Äôre playing with arguably the best squad in the world it‚Äôs no surprise lol. They got outplayed by Serbia for 60 mins\n\nDenmark for around 80 mins.\n\nReally should have lost to Denmark. They‚Äôll be breathing a sigh of relief and Denmark will be disappointed with the result.\n\nShould we? They didn't really have any threatening chances - even the goal came from a long shot from 30 yards out. Same goes for Serbia, people say we \"Got outplayed\" but they never looked like scoring, we went 1-0 up and then denied them any threatening chances. You can dislike the style of play but it does a good job of stopping teams being able to threaten us.\n\nOutshot 7-4 shots on target, outshot generally 16-12, Pickford needed to make at least two or three very good saves.  \n\nAdmittedly the goal was an absolute cracker, but Denmark easily could‚Äôve had one or two more, and England seemed to be the side that lacked any teeth, to me. I think one might be able to say they think a draw is fair, but if there was going to be a winner it was only going one way.\n\nWhat other good saves did Pickford made? There only other chances were long range efforts from Hojberg. I don't think it was likely that they scored at all, and the goal was a massive outlier. If anything, we were the closer side to scoring again, with Foden's effort which hit the post, Watkins strike just after he came on, and Saka's header which glanced wide.\n\nIf you feel like it shouldn't have been close because we are England and they are Denmark, then fair enough, but i feel we were the more likely side to win the game.\n\nHe‚Äôs to England what Roberto Martinez was to Belgian. A manager ill equipped to get the best out of a great talent pool of players.\n\nWe've progressed in those tournaments despite Southgate, not because of him\n\nDid you watch the game?????\n\nLook at the talent he has. 1-1 to Denmark. Boring play. He has no gumption.\n\nPlacing Bowen ahead of Palmer or even not subbing on Mainoo in the midfield is a crime\n\nBringing on Gallagher too\n\nLooking at the bravery and commitment and spirit and adventurous style of play from some teams so far - like Turkey,  Georgia, Albania, Austria, Spain etc. - it's a shame to see England playing the way they do, always playing the percentages and tiptoeing through the competition. It's a short tournament and they have a lot of good players up front,  they should be let off the leash v Slovenia. Starting to think that they are only effective in the qualifiers at home now.\n\nBecause in those tournaments, he only gets by past much weaker teams despite having an extremely talented squad, if not having world class players in all the attacking positions. The moment we come up against half decent teams around our level or higher, we look absolutely toothless. That Italy final should have been an England win, yet we were lucky to make it to penalties. The only 'big' team Southgate beat in a tournament was Germany at last euros and they were possibly the weakest Germany side we have seen over the last decade.\n\nThe previous 'golden generation' were held back by not being able to play alongside each other no matter what manager we had. This is a generation of super talented and well coached players who are being held back by a manager who doesn't know how to use them effectively\n\nHave you watched England play‚Ä¶.\n\nThis is one of the best and talented English squads ever with one of the worst managers ever....\n\nWell its simple, he has one of the most complete + young team there is (the keeper isnt amazing but above average id say) and instead of playing a nice attacking football  since they have the pace and the football iq to play it.\n\nHe keeps Cole Palmer on the bench when they need goals even though he was amazing this season. He always plays the same team and they are always extremely boring to watch when they play defensive teams or some harder oponents. His tactics are the same and people got used to it...i wont be surprised if the \"favorite\" England goes out in the first elimination game tbh.\n\nIts just that with that pool of talents every damn gsme can be classified as \"underwhelming\".¬†\n\nHe doesnt seem to be able to balance midfield at all.¬†\n\n[removed]\n\nHe stated that \"we haven't found a replacement for Kelvin Phillips\" and this is the reason why we are so poor.\n\nHis football IQ, is the same number as the age of Jimmy Saville taste in girls.\n\nHere‚Äôs the thing‚Ä¶.Southgate has some of the world‚Äôs best players and talents to his disposal. Being boring is not the reason, boring is a side effect of Southgate‚Äôs complete failure. \nHis tactics are ‚Äútry score a goal‚Äù. As soon as it‚Äôs 1:0 we stop playing, park bus, defend deep and hope they don‚Äôt score against us. It is so bad they even stop pressing the opposition for the ball. They literally just stand there, ‚Äúkeeping the shape‚Äù and let opposition play. Check the match stats‚Ä¶.England usually comes out with high possession at the start of the game. Once they score this always changes. It goes from 65% for England to 40% possession. This is why it‚Äôs boring to watch. But more importantly, this allows opponents to have the ball, get back in the game, and more often than not‚Ä¶.score a goal and equalise. For a good team like France or Germany, this is a wake up call and they can tear you apart. England is lucky enough most of the teams are not France or Germany. And they can either ride the stalemate or maybe even have someone like Foden to pull a worldie and score 2nd goal. So they get away with it. But that‚Äôs because of quality of players. They win despite Southgate, not thanks to him.\nBut this only works against ‚Äúnot so strong‚Äù teams in a group. When you get to quarter or semifinal, with a good team, that‚Äôs why England always fails.\n\nThen it‚Äôs his favouritism. Sure every manager has favourites, but Southgate takes it to another level.\nIf Henderson didn‚Äôt retire, he would play him till his 60th birthday.\nIf Shaw &amp; Maquire weren‚Äôt injured you can bet they would be starting for England. Shaw is a good player to be fair. And so is Maquire, if you want to sit deep and do nothing. But there are younger, better players who have been waiting for their chance to play for years and never got it. Look at Guehi.\nHe never subs Kane. Never. Ok, he did last game‚Ä¶but Kane always plays, even if he plays badly. While you have Ollie Watkins &amp; Cole Palmer sitting on the bench and rarely get to play even few minutes.\n\nAnd Alexander Arnold is a chapter for its own book to be honest. He‚Äôs a good Right back. ATTACKING right back. He is known for his assists and precision crosses into the box. His foot is made of gold. Probably 1 of the world‚Äôs best in that area. But everyone who watches Liverpool and Premier League knows, defensively he‚Äôs weak. He‚Äôs pretty much responsible for half of Liverpool‚Äôs goals on both sides of the pitch. \nWhy would you ever put a guy like that in defensive midfield position? That is a riddle only Southgate knows an answer to. Surely you‚Äôd want to take advantage of his qualities and cover his shortcomings. Not Southgate. By playing him as CDM he made all his qualities redundant, because he can‚Äôt attack and put crosses in. And then he asks him to cover the probably most important defensive position‚Ä¶.a guy who‚Äôs weak defensively‚Ä¶\nThen he comes out in the press conference saying ‚Äúwe didn‚Äôt win because we miss Kelvin Phillips‚Äù\nWHAT???? You mean the guy who never played a single match for Man City, can‚Äôt even start for a mid table team and didn‚Äôt get a call from YOU because he‚Äôs been shtt for several seasons? And now he‚Äôs blaming for the loss a guy who‚Äôs not even in the team!\nAnd all of this is happening while you have Declan Rice in the team, literally the best CDM in England‚Ä¶ make it make sense.\nBut Southgate is scared of big name players. He doesn‚Äôt wanna piss Walker and he doesn‚Äôt wanna piss Arnold. So he plays them both.\n\nMost of England‚Äôs talent is in midfield &amp; attack. Foden, Bellingham, Kane, Saka‚Ä¶etc. There‚Äôs so much talent they can leave players like Grealish or Rashford out of team. But Southgate defensive (non)tactics hinders all of it useless. He takes a world class team and makes them average.\nA decent coach could do amazing things with a team like England. Look at Ralf Rangnick with Austria. He doesn‚Äôt have big names like England, but he has them playing. Or Germany with Nagelsmann.\n\nYou see, it‚Äôs not a question of ‚ÄúCroatia were good‚Äù. It is on England and how ‚Äúbad‚Äù they are on any given match day.\n\n2020‚Ä¶.Italy won on penalties because Southgate once again scored first. Then he parked the bus and let Italy play the ball. This gave them the opportunity to create more chances and eventually score. England should have win that game, they didn‚Äôt because of Southgate.\n\nSure, France is a strong team. But that‚Äôs exactly the point. As soon as üè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å•Û†ÅÆÛ†ÅßÛ†Åø gets out of the group they can‚Äôt sit back and defend a 1 goal lead anymore. They have to play a good football against good teams. And Southgate can‚Äôt do it.\n\nI don't think he's hated, I think in fact as a person he is loved and when he leaves the job will be knighted and become a national treasure. People recognise that he is a good man who has managed to create a togetherness in the England team that previously struggled with the pressure of international football. However, there is a lot of frustration with the tactics and performances, which are negative and pedestrian at best and in these first two games actually really poor. England have some wonderful players and the Premier League has the reputation of being a dynamic and physical league. We just want to see our players / team show what makes our league so entertaining. Taking an early lead then hanging on for dear life for 70 minutes against Serbia and Denamrk is embarrassing.\n\nIncredibly fair and balanced take for an England fan, you must be high.\n\nIt's not that I hate him. He's probably a fairly nice man. He isn't a top football manager. His approach is defensive and dull to watch, which was fine in 2018 when he had a fairly unremarkable England squad to work with and managed to beat Tunisia, Panama, Sweden and Colombia (on penalties) and all of a sudden found himself in a World Cup semi final, but now we have world class players and he has no idea how to set us up to play good football.\n\nThe team parks the bus whenever they go 1-0 up, which works a lot of the time against teams outside the top 15-20, but as soon as we face anyone decent we unsurprisingly fail to hold a lead and get broken down.\n\nHe's always got us through qualifying and he's never gone out of a major tournament against minnows, but that's really the bare minimum in terms of expectation. Barring the Euro 2020 win against a relatively poor Germany side we've lost every time we come up against a big team.\n\nIn summary, he's the best manager England have had since Sven, which isn't saying much.\n\nHe's overthinking his tactics. \n\nHe should do it the Ancellotti way and just play the most attacking formation with the best players in each position and tell them to just go and win.\n\nYou can hardly call it overthinking. Overthinking is when Guardiolas tries something new in a CHL finale.\n\nSouthgate has no concept whatsoever. You can write books about his obvious incompetence.\n\nThe English premier league is one of the best leagues in the world with the best marketing. The pundits and commentators routinely tell us it is the best and all the players most therefore also be the best ( rather than say a mix of a few of the best with most good or very good) . They drive an idea that all is needed then is the best players and trophies will inevitably follow. Balance tactics (other than all out attack) the idea that other teams might be better are largely ignored online. So possible Tottenhamitis. \n\n\nSurprisingly though it doesn't happen as much with their clubs, especially non Premier league ones, though they are always a section that will. \n\nNot sure about the 80s but it's been happening consistently since 96. The press always say we have the greatest generation in part based the fact they play in the prem. And ignore that say Brazil did not actually win in 98. Or Frances failure in 2002. Greece 2004 has been struck from the record as completely goes against the ideas. France 98 Italy 2006, Germany 2014 and Portugal 2016  Italy 2020 are retconned to pretend they were favourites. 2000 the spainish victories of 2008-2012 are all lauded as if they are the rule.\n\n2018 wcup- finished second to belgium in the group stage, lost to belgium in the group stage, won against Tunisia with 90th min goal. \nIn knockout defeated colombia on penalties, then faced shit sweden team and then lost to Croatia. \nSo the crux is whenever they faced a decent team they got exposed. \n2020 euros- defeated sub par germany and had the easiest route to finals and got exposed in the end by england.\n2022 wcup- easiest group, still drew with wales and USA. Faced Senegal and france in the knockout stages and got outplayed by france. \nThey have lost majority of the times when facing a decent opposition. \nSouthgate said yesterday they do not have any one to replace kelvin phillips. They have jude, declan, gallagher, mainoo, wharton and he is still waffling about god knows what!! Getting dominated by erikson who came back from dead.  \nHe should have been sacked a long time ago.\n\nSIDE NOTE- Kalvin Philips was in the England World Cup squad in Qatar 2 years ago and he didn‚Äôt start him once hahahaha!\n\nBecause he waits until around 60 minutes to make a like-for-like change in EVERY MATCH, irrespective of what's happening. I assume it's to make us think he's actually doing something.\n\nHe changes personnel but never tactics.\n\nAlso, we actually had 3 right backs start yesterday and numerous players out of position. For some reason.\n\nHe manages like he's at the helm of prime Juve with Buffon, Barzagli, Chiellini, and Bonucci. Score a goal and sit back. The rest takes care of itself.\n\nThat Phillips comment yesterday is a sackable offense imo\n\nEngland were favourites going into the euros BECAUSE we have one of the most talented squads in the tournament. And yet they are scraping by with a 1-0 win over Serbia and a 1-1 draw against Denmark.\nThey should be winning comfortable with 3 or 4 goals each game.\nWe do well despite Southgate and not because of him. I genuinely think any league 1 manager would have got this england team the same results, if not better. \n\nHe has been manager now for 8 years. It‚Äôs time to go. We are WASTING a fantastic squad with him. Enough is enough now. Look at Germany. They sacked flick and are now flying. Why aren‚Äôt we doing the same?\n\nHopefully you‚Äôve seen some Premier League football and I can explain it using that.\n\nSouthgate has drilled them to retreat without the ball. Often in the game yesterday there were eight England players goal side of all but two Denmark players, miles away from the ball.\n\nLook at the Premier League, the successful teams all high press their opponents. High press is when a team‚Äôs attackers close down the defenders with the ball in a group to try and win the ball back in their opponent‚Äôs half.\n\nThis allows the team to push their defenders forward onto the halfway line and beyond and force their opponents to play in their own half, allowing them less space.\n\nThe team doing the high press has to be careful with the ball and not give it away. Their defenders need to be good enough to receive the ball and even beat a man to retain it.\n\nGood teams can do this and it destroys the opposition. England have good enough players to do this proven by the fact they do this for their clubs.\n\nThe weaker Premier League teams retreat into their own half and let their opposition have the ball and try and breakdown their attacks there. This is because they don‚Äôt have good enough players to pull off the high press and the necessity to maintain possession while doing it.\n\nThe downside of this approach is that it is difficult to keep the ball when you win it back as there is nobody to pass to because they are all behind the ball in the your own half which is full of the opposition. In this situation you have to kick it away or try and find a lone man up field.\n\nThis is what Southgate is doing. He‚Äôs playing an incredibly talented England team as if they were second rate.\n\nThey are often still good enough to win but (putting aside the debate on whether the English players are better than the Spanish players) most of the England players could swap in and easily play for a high pressing team like Spain without an issue.\n\nDenmark were able to high press England yesterday because England were so negative.\n\nThe England team are well drilled and doing exactly what Southgate is telling them without the ball. But what he has told them is wrong.\n\nIn the semi final against Croatia, the final against Italy and the quarter final against France, England scored and sat back. When drawing or losing Southgate allows them to attack but when winning they sit back and invite the other team to score.\n\nAgainst Serbia this was fine but the good teams are good enough to score and you simply have to keep attacking.\n\nContrary to what the rest of the world thinks we don't all expect England to win every tournament we qualify for, we just expect our team to give a good account of themselves and to play to their ability. The last few years under Southgate we haven't done this. Most teams in these Euros are at worst the sum of their parts, with many being more than the sum of their parts. England always manages to find a way to be less than the sum of their parts....\n\nYank here. All the English people I've talked to around here don't seem to hate him and they give the reasons you've listed in your post. If it were me and I were an English fan, I'd be livid we were still hanging on to Southgate. Just because he's gotten the farthest in recent competitions compared to coaches of the past doesn't automatically make him a good fit for the English squad. It's almost like Stockholm Syndrome with some of these fans and Southgate.\n\nstep one - have a bunch of talented youngsters who dazzle on attack\n\nstep two - have a media that hypes up all the talented youngsters\n\nstep three - have a manager who can't connect the midfield to the attack and plays half the talented youngsters out of position every game but somehow still succeeds because of how good his players are but spend the whole time wondering how much further they could go with a real manager\n\nGo 1-0 up early -&gt; park the bus and let the other team dominate possession -&gt; invite pressure without responding with any aggression -&gt; concede -&gt; first sub in the 70th minute -&gt; momentum changes for 10 minutes then the focus is on seeing the game out rather than taking chances. \n\nIt‚Äôs the same old story and has cost us winning our first major trophy in a long time, given our luck with easy runs in the 2018 wc and 2020 euros. \nWe isolate our attackers with this overly-defensive style - the pundits were bang on with saying ‚Äòthe balance is completely off‚Äô. We provide zero presence in the centre of the pitch, as he is essentially building the team around kalvin f*cking Phillips so according to him an out-of-position trent seems like the next best option - if you saw the Denmark game you‚Äôd see that we were second to every ball in midfield, and when saka tried to break it up he‚Äôd have zero support.\nWe just don‚Äôt want to see our talent go to waste, and it seems like he learned nothing from our previous championship exits.\n\nAnyone who puts a 19 year old (who had never taken a penalty at a major tournament before) on a potentially game losing penalty will forever be a clueless moron in my book. And that's just the beginning.\n\nBefore this tournament I was a Southgate in. I‚Äôm 29 and have never seen my country do well really. I know we had 2002 and were knocked out by a ridiculous Brasil side. Euro 2004 pretty much relied on Rooney and we were fucked when he got injured.\n\nSince then we have been poor to abysmal in tournaments. Bot qualifying for Euro 2008. Losing to Iceland in Euro 2016 (I get that upsets happen in sport, but that was madness).  \n\nSince Southgate we have had a World Cup Semi (since 1966 only 1990 brought us that), a Euro‚Äôs final, and a loss to a brilliant French side in 2022 (arguably we should have taken them to extra time).\n\nHowever we have the best player in England (Foden), Spain (Bellingham) and Germany (Kane). We should be doing what France did last WC and what Germany are doing now. Controlling games.\n\nEuro 2020 started with a 1-0 win over Croatia and a bad 0-0 draw with Scotland. So I‚Äôm not in panic mode yet considering we got to the final. But those comments about ‚Äúwe miss a Kalvin Phillips in midfield‚Äù essentially saying he‚Äôs irreplaceable. Yet Southgate took him to the 22 WC and never played him?? Talks about playing ‚Äúin form‚Äù players then leaves Cole Palmer and Kobbie Mainoo on the bench and doesn‚Äôt play them üòÇ\n\nA win and a draw in your first two games is so important at tournaments. We have that. So we are pretty much confirmed through. We‚Äôll see in the knockout games if we look like we are playing to win rather than playing to not lose.\n\nHe's a dullard. So boring and uninspired.\nAchieved nothing as a player and even less as a manager. Highlights being missing a crucial penalty, laughing about it on pizza hut adverts, getting beat 5-0 every week with Boro, saying he takes positives from the game and being relegated.\n\nHe wasted a pool of talents with his tactics. And he picked players on popularity. Why is he complaining about not having Kalvin Phillips replacement, when Kalvin phillips himself is available to play?\n\n\n\nIt's like, he choose aston martin over fiat, while he has the option to choose fiat, and drive those aston martin like a fiat, ignoring what his aston martine features on the car\n\nWe have the top goal scorer and probably the most complete number 9 in the world, The best player in the premier league and La Liga. We have Stones, Trent, Rice, Saka which are all top tier players and so many other fantastic talents and we play the most horrific football. \n\nTheres no identity. Its cowardly. We go one nill up from a poorly constructed attack and we hid. The players look scared. Its a slog every single time. \n\nThats why. We have the talent, we have Champions league winners but we play like we never played football before."

Azienda, compagnia, impresa, Empresa...\n\nIt's probably how we ended up with it in English. Old English was gendered back when it was closer to German than anything else. Then the Vikings turned up and it rapidly got messy\n\nBrother, hold on to this hotel for me\n\nHow about step-sister companies?\n\nOh no now theyll get a transfer ban for two years how will they get any new players in... Oh wait they've already got three squads\n\nPlease no transfer ban, that would bring some kind of stability and \"us vs them\" mentality to Chelsea, and they're much funnier right now.\n\ntwo year transfer ban that's somehow suspended for the next transfer window though so they'll buy 200 more players.\n\nBut will investigate them many years after, when they can use the 'too late to legally investigate as per UEFA rules' card\n\nThat would depend if they're willing to pay for it.\n\nAnd yet I remain fully confident that nothing will happen to them,\n\nIf this is only a rule passed recently Chelsea are fine, they didn‚Äôt break the rule as the rule didn‚Äôt exist. They can‚Äôt be charged for it\n\nAs a Derby fan, that isn‚Äôt true. We got shafted for something which wasn‚Äôt against the rules until they changed it. That said, this is big 6 Premier League, so you‚Äôll probably be right.\n\nYeah they can actually. This isn't a rule change, it's confirmation of existing rules\n\nThis isn't true. Chelsea assumed that this sale would be fine and get through, and help make them FFP eligible, this is UEFA telling them categorically that they cannot. Chelsea has been daring a transfer ban for years, why do you think they have 40+ Senior Squad players?\n\nNot true. First, this isn‚Äôt the breaking of the rules, there‚Äôs nothing here to charge Chelsea with other than FFP. Second, this is a clarification on existing rules, not a change in them.\n\nThis is absolutely a massive problem for Chelsea now. If they get banned from continental competition, I genuinely do not see a recovery plan here.\n\nLego-105 says it is ABSOLUTELY A MASSIVE PROBLEM. Confirmed, here we go.\n\nClub assets stripped from them by venture capitalist owners and still getting the FFP hit. Lose lose scenario for the club. What a mess\n\nSurely this time a ban is really truly coming. I've been reading about it for over 20 years.\n\nYeah because they will probably find a way to play by the rules.\n\nThis is by a guy that's not even close to tier 1 for Chelsea news and when people asked him how he found that out he just said \"UEFA told me\". I mean thats about as good as \"Source: Trust me bro\".\n\nNot saying UEFA wouldn't do something like this but theres been no press release or conference or anything from UEFA and theres no other journos talking about this at the moment. So its probably better to wait for something more credible to come up before getting carried away.\n\nChelsea did it already, they are now just closing the loophole same as with the 7 year contracts\n\nNo, they are saying that the sale will not count. Chelsea are screwed\n\nThats the wet dream of everyone for thr lat 2 decades. Yet i can confidently say nothing too serious will happen.\n\nExcept this was already mentioned way back when the sales happened. It was known.\n\nIs Chelsea secret blessing for FIFA/UEFA/Premier league? We r finding every possible loophole there is and they r changing rules as we go lol\n\nSpending like 1.4B and still playing only conference league, the head of this must be cut off .\n\nYeah, they closed the loophole, but it isn't retroactive, so finances are fine as it stands.\n\njust another twitter account farming for reactions.\n\nIt is retroactive. Read any article covering this. This is a clarification on existing rules, not a change. The finances are very much not fine.\n\nWho did they even sell to strasbourg? The mojor sell were Gallagher and lukaku\n\nIt's about the hotels and other buildings that the club sold to another company of the owners.(from Chelsea FC Holdings Ltd to Blueco 22 Properties Ltd both of which are owned by Blueco 22 Ltd.)\n\nIts not player sales\n\n\n\n\nIts shit like selling off your carparks and areas of the stadium to other companies you own, pretending it's income when it's just laundering\n\nAs long as they don't admit to anything like Everton did, y'know because admitting to something means you are completely at fault and deserve proper punishment, I'm sure they'll be fine.\n\nA lot of people are missing the point here, it doesn‚Äôt have to be retroactive because the Chelsea asset sales were never approved by any governing body.\n\nWhat if it's a step sister?\n\nYou‚Äôve seen too much internet\n\nAm I being stupid or does this not affect the premier league because it‚Äôs governed by the FA and not UEFA? Does this just mean possible ineligibility for Champions league etc?\n\nWhat about step sister‚Ä¶\n\nHelp me step bro I'm stuck in the Laundering Machine\n\nThere were articles about this at the time . They did this for EPL fair play rules. But I'm sure they'll meet Uefa rules as well. Sorry to disappoint you but these hedge fund guys are surprisingly good at this sort of thing.\n\nyea sure mate i totally believe a random tweet.  no background info, what major challenge?  how are they gonna enforce it THIS season when the season already started? how many players are we talking about? because we're talking about strasbourg right? not more than 1 or 2? not saying its not true but this post stinks\n\nBoehly masterblan in shambles :)\n\nü§ûüèæ\n\nYES\n\nGood\n\nEvery club bar Man City can face punishment in the Premier League.\n\nAt this point Chelsea deserve to be relegated to the bumhole league to think about what they‚Äôve done, absolute shambles, can‚Äôt even cheat properly\n\nEPL now need to do the same thing. There will be chaos everywhere for so many clubs üòÇ üòÇ¬†\n\nWhile this is good, banning multi-club ownership is the simpler and better answer to this problem.\n\nThis article makes you think this is something new but it‚Äôs been a rule so clearly Chelsea owners have thought of this. Feel like this will be a non issue\n\nSerious question though, shouldn‚Äôt these regulations/changes have a set timeframe when they take effect? Like ‚Äúfrom next year‚Äù?\n\nChelsea‚Äôs situation is shit. Changing laws/regulations this late in the transfer window with immediate effect is shit from UEFA too though.\n\nAh goal post moving\n\nNothing will happen, EPL inherited the English tradition of piracy and caring less about rules, they‚Äôll bribe their way out\n\nBrown paper bag incoming"

I think playing under ATH‚Äôs system made him significantly worse than he actually is‚Äî he was very talented on Ajax and I believe he can reach those levels again under Motta‚Äôs new Juve system\n\n[deleted]\n\nAbsolutely. 200k is a rare weekly salary in Serie A in general, and Antony should not be one of those very few\n\nHe doesn't need to be on ¬£200k. United, by the sounds of things, will be picking up the slack.\n\n&gt;he was very talented on Ajax and I believe he can reach those levels again under Motta‚Äôs new Juve system\n\nEhh, Antony played under Ten Hag at Ajax, not sure what you're talking about here.\n\nDifferent system and also different league.\n\nIt‚Äôs crazy that in one league you can have a certain style and dominate but try the same style in a different league and you‚Äôll do the complete opposite.\n\nThat is my point. He obviously wasn‚Äôt as prominent in the Premier League, which is why I think he will be good for the Serie A, especially how well Motta is developing our wingers right now\n\nHe wasn‚Äôt the best winger, it was Gakpo back then as well. The whole transfer made no sense.\n\nGakpo was at PSV. \n\nDon't say things like that in the Netherlands. Those tall bastards will get ya.\n\nExcept he didn't dominate\n\nSame system.. A(?)TH's system. Which you're literally comparing him to.\n\nHe did but at Ajax he was used correctly. \n\nHe's an inverted winger that solely cuts inside, so needs an attacking wingback to support him and provide the width.\n\nUnited never had that, with Wan Bissaka being defensive and Dalot being more inverted or more often playing on the left.\n\nUnited pretty much exclusively used him as a touchline winger which he is not at all.\n\nHe has been terrible for them but they have misused him completely imo.\n\nHe's talking about A(?)TH's system. The system was Ten Hag's at Ajax, hence the confusion.\n\nYour club is welcomed to take him.\n\nLike Man United was welcome to take him off our hands lol.\n\nHah baldhag has gotten your club filthy rich you should build a statue of him! ü§£ü§£\n\nMan utd should just hire whoever Anthony‚Äôs coach at an Ajax was and get the best out of him..\n\nShould get the right back that played behind him too whilst we're at it\n\nlol\n\nThat one wasn't on ten hag at all. \n\nHe would do random pirouettes in the middle of the pitch for no reason and kick the ball out of play. Antony lacks pace, vision, crossing and the ability to finish the ball. \n\nI'm not a United fan and I loved when he would play because he was truly awful. He made Dan Burn look like a world class CB when he played us. Honestly one of the worst signings in premier league history\n\n&gt; He would do random pirouettes in the middle of the pitch for no reason and kick the ball out of pla\n\nOh yes, that one play he executed once is a perfect reference point for judging a player's playstyle\n\n&gt; He made Dan Burn look like a world class CB when he played us\n\n[Hmmm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhDFu0mzDsU)\n\nFair play to you for finding that, he did absolutely have burn's life in that clip although he didn't get anywhere. \n\nThere was a match (might have been the season we came 4th) where Antony got subbed off on like the 60th minute because he kept running into Burn and did absolutely nothing all game.\n\nI still maintain Antony is a fucking dreadful player, one clip won't change that.\n\nHe's extremely one-dimensional and only has one foot. He'd end up like Chukwueze at Milan...\n\nIt didn't help that he mostly had AwB behind him, who's not exactly an attacking fullback and he often fell into a back three. Antony is so one-dimensional that he desperately needed an overlapping fullback.\n\nHe played under EtH at Ajax too.\n\nHe wasn't that good at Ajax at all lol. Greetings, a Dutch football fan\n\nI watch all United games. He‚Äôs a one trick pony, and even that one trick very rarely succeeds.\n\nI don't think you realise just how bad he currently is. I don't see why any club in a top 4 league would want to even take the risk unless it's a free transfer and a short term contract¬†\n\nWtf man?\n\nALL CAPS TURKISH TEXT ALL CAPS TURKISH TEXT ALL CAPS TURKISH TEXT !!!!!!üí•üí•‚ú®‚ú®üëäüëäüëçüëçüí™üí™üí™üí™üí™\n\nFenerbache\n\nPls dont\n\nr/soccercirclejerk is going to lose it.\n\nThe meltdown is in full tilt.\n\nThey‚Äôre all asking if Antony is a racist.\n\nIt's okay the GOAT has merely finished grazing on the green fields of United before he climbs back to his peak üí™üí™üí™üí™üí™üí™üí™ü´∂üí™üí™üí™üí™\n\n&gt;Antony is on 200K/week. A loan seems the only realistic option\n\nAlso known as the Manchester United classic.\n\nI didn‚Äôt know he was on those wages. I want to throw up\n\nMount on 250k. Rashford on 300. \n  \nJust have to laugh tbh. \n  \nSimilar age to Trent and earning so much more. No wonder trent won't sign a new contract when his peers are earning like that whilst being shit.\n\nAnd I forgot about Mount even being on the team. This is so painful.\n\nI think Mount himself has probably forgotten being on the team, too!\n\nI can honestly say I forgot mount existed, at the time I was livid we‚Äôd sold him but now holy shit we got away with robbery lol\n\nActually Rashford is on 375k per week instead of 300k\n\nI am kinda new with football contract stuff,\n\nI get that MU wanted to rid of him asap,\n\nBut why would Antony agreed to that? (Accepting a potentially lower wages in other club)\nHe had lived comfortably earning 200k/week until 2027,\n\nCan't he just run down his contract and decline every offer?\n\nEdit : I send the same message twice\n\nThat‚Äôs why he likely won‚Äôt leave\n\n\n&gt;Can't he just run down his contract and decline every offer?\n\nHe can. Players have done so in the past. \n\nThese contracts are binding on both parties, so if Antony doesn't want to leave there's nothing united can do about it. Sure they can try to make his life miserable by forcing him to train with the reserves or U21s or something in an attempt to frustrate him into accepting a transfer away but they cannot unilaterally get rid of him.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Can't he just run down his contract and decline every offer?\n\nYes. But due to pure economics and rationality, he will likely will take a loan with a percent of his wages paid by the loaning club\n\nSome players want to play, be on camera, show the world what they can do etc etc.¬†\n\n\nSome players would gladly sit on the bench for the paycheck.¬†\n\nhttps://www.theplayerstribune.com/posts/antony-brazil-world-cup-soccer-premier-league-manchester-united?fbclid=PAZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAaYCCvB5y3oY-T6AwBBzl0-a7fYTZ9rvvL4dwNszNRUv-xxWQx0xERL1Pgk_aem_jsf2TyA22PxKOVxEe6MqZA\n\nIn what way did a ‚Ç¨95m price tag and a 200k wage ever appear justifiable for a player like Antony? Like, those numbers should be reserved for the absolute elite, the cr√®me de la cr√®me, not some scrub who performed semi-decently in a second rate league. It‚Äôs just nuts. What could‚Äôve possessed the board to sign him for that much, what the hell were they thinking?\n\nAlways thought there was a collution among Murtough, ETH, and SEG which happened to be ETH agency. We paid 72m for Hojlund who was also SEG client.\n\nKinda wish he gets the Sancho treatment and lands a loan deal to Chelsea or Ajax and immediately becomes class somehow\n\nIn the Dutch league he will easily shine again.\n\nOr the serie A\n\nEredivisie might be his true level\n\nLol how could the whole club go along with this? This has to be the biggest blunder signing of all time.\n\nMan U can cover up to half the wage if yey want even when selling Anthony\n\nOh No\n\n- Every other team‚Äôs fan\n\nAnyway.\n\n(Every Man U fan)\n\nVini Mbappe Antony is gonna be so legendary next year the balon d'Or will split into three.\n\nI hope we can see Antony return to his 2008 form\n\nI agree, 3rd grade Antony was his peak\n\nOh no! Who will perform meaningless step-overs and give away possession now?\n\nRashford?\n\nMaybe I'm being too simplistic, but if he would/could actually do something besides angrily shooting the ball directly at the keeper, he'd be alright.\n\nWould be a massive mistake to sell the GOAT\n\nBebe‚Äôs long gone unfortunately.\n\nZoran Tosic was there too but no Antony was worse.\n\nDi Maria and Sancho talented but much worse purchase, heck even Zaha was worse purchase than Bebe\n\nWho told him he could leave? The \"new\" manager who is still officially nobody? Ruud is an interim, he doesn't have the power to fuck him off lol.\n\nI think sporting directors have the final say in most cases nowadays, plus it's not hard to see Anthony has been poor\n\nHead Coach. Not manager. The Head Coach certainly has a say, but ultimately transfer decisions are not down to the Head Coach.\n\n[Get ready to learn Chinese buddy](https://mememirth.com/media/templates_webp/template_get-ready-to-learn-chinese-buddy.webp)\n\nSo many Man Utd players have Turkish Super League written all over them.\n\nDripping in it\n\nTen hag managed to scam a whole freaking club\n\nWELCOME TO ARIS FC\n\nShould join ISLüáÆüá≥\n\nMy üêê doesn't need isl, isl needs my üêê\n\n\"Sent him back to the favelas\" one step closer to becoming real\n\nHe was quite good at Ajax.

I just really can‚Äôt imagine any clubs wanting him. Maybe Ajax but that‚Äôs it.\n\nGetting rid of Antony and Ten Hag the same year would be better than top 4.\n\nCan any club even afford him ?!\n\nWelcome to Saudi Arabia!\n\nThis is the funniest transfer of all time. Man Utd fans have to know we're gonna be bringing him up for the next 10 years at least.\n\nBringing him up for 10 years? Are u 14?\n\nAndy Carroll still gets mentioned (largely in the context of Nunez) when it comes to Liverpool, and he arrived 13 years ago and left 11 years ago. I would argue Antony was a worse disaster.¬†\n\nAnd lets be honest, Liverpool didn't \"pay\" for Carroll. Chelsea did. Liverpool's deal with Chelsea for buying Torres was always \"What Liverpool pays for Carroll + 15\". Kept in that lens, Carroll is much less remarkable transfer. Newcastle jacked the price for Carroll late on from 25 to 35, and Chelsea still said, \"yep, we'll do it\".\n\n  \n[https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/feb/04/john-w-henry-interview-liverpool](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/feb/04/john-w-henry-interview-liverpool)\n\nIf by ‚Äògets mentioned‚Äô you mean by 13 year olds in various subs online ‚Ä¶. Jesus lol\n\nWasn't talking about online lad, matches exist ya know? \"You're just a shit Andy Carroll\" not ring any bells?\n\nBem-vindo ao Meng√£o\n\n[removed]\n\nI think Flamengo is the only one with enough $$$ for him.\n\nNever know, he might be like the others, play twice as good with new manager\n\nThis has so much Botafogo's energy on it.\n\n\nHope it happens.\n\nWelcome to Flamengo!\n\ni don‚Äôt get the memes about him, he‚Äôs genuinely embarrassing to watch\n\nI really believe he's gonna become a great player\n\nEnd of an era üò•üò•\n\nHe is up there on the S tier podium with BeBe and Dong Fangzhou\n\nI mean someone might take a flyer on him for a cheap price and United paying up a large part of his contract. \n\nI have barely seen a hint of a player worth 10 million yet alone 85 + agent fees + ridiculous contract \n\nThe amount of money that United have wasted on dross and washed up players with little/no sell on value is staggering.\n\nSo why did they keep him in the summer when it was very clear he was out of favor?¬†\n#MUN rebuild¬†\n\nI think if the new manager goes 3 4 3 and antony plays on right back he will be good\n\nHe can find himself elsewhere. Don't give up\n\nüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ more like the dog and duck\n\nFlop!? He‚Äôs the goat\n\nCome to Man City üî•üôèü•∫\n\nNow thats the right club for his showcase\n\nThey should rename the club to football talent graveyard. At this rate, if ManU is interested in some player, then I would seriosly question their talent if it really exists or just hype.\n\nHonestly, he can use him just as he does Catamo and Quenda.\n\nOf course he can leave, but who on earth would take him at his financial terms? He‚Äôs simply not good enough to justify that. \n\nMore like, ‚Äúmaybe he could leave if both Man Utd and Antony himself are prepared to take massive financial hits to facilitate a deal, but this seems unlikely‚Äù. \n\nOtherwise no reason for him to do anything but sit out his contract, stay as fit as can be without competitive matches, and injury free on the training ground.\n\nThey brought after seen him on a dvd video??? How this guy mananged to pull such a trick?:))\n\nI don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs just that he wants to play right wing and score goals, but he has all the attributes of the kind of left wing back United really need to make this 3-4-3 work. \n\nHolds width well, good defensively, has a good cross on him, a good engine.\n\nIt wouldn‚Äôt shock me that somehow he becomes good again after he leaves united. Plenty of players somehow turn out good when they leave old trafford\n\nAs a defender, you absolutely know this guy isn't going to cross. You know he's going to cut inside. Must be so easy playing against him.¬†\n\nI can‚Äôt believe they are willing to let him go! He still haven‚Äôt lost a game that he won\n\nS√£o Paulo te aguarda, Antony!\n\nThanks god , I see him playing for a Turkish team\n\n..and yet he has outpriced himself for most clubs interested in signing him by now. Football is beautiful that way.\n\nthis is honestly crazy and sad..\n\n\"[H]e can leave Man Utd in January\", if he wants. But if he wants to stay, he stays.\n\nToo much humor leaving the league :(\n\nWtf told he can leave ...when a new manager comes, he gets a new try out no? I mean he's very overrated, but he doesn't have to go anywhere.\n\nWho rates Antony?\n\nTen Hag.\n\nIs that why he‚Äôs on the bench most games?\n\nHe was bought for too much money and put on a contract that pays too much. But he is far from overrated, he is literally ridiculed\n\nDoesn‚Äôt really fit the new managers system and I think they are ready to cut losses rather than drag it out anymore when he clearly isn‚Äôt at the needed level.\n\nHe can be a good left wing back. His defensive work rate is good. If Amorim plays 3atb Anthony can play in lwb or rwb.\n\nArsenal will be his redemption. He‚Äôs built for us.\n\nHe should go to a team in Belgium that's more his level."

Only half way through the season.\n\n\"Last Season\" is written on map\n\nWhy did you post it as \"this season\" then?\n\nBecause Normal Season is which starts from August to May.\n\nWhy did you switch to a summer season anyway?\n\nI get it for the Nordic countries where it's just too cold to play in the winter, but Ireland shouldn't have that issue.\n\nWinters are still pretty miserable here, wet, windy, cold. Easier to draw a crowd with better weather and also the and SPFL EPL are very popular so it's less competition. \n\nFootball is the 4th most popular sport here on an island with a small population so they did whatever they could to increase the popularity of the League of Ireland. It's been relatively successful too.\n\nGood to hear it's been successful at least.\n\nHas there ever been any talk about a combined Irish league? IIRC Derry City play in the league of Ireland already, but can't help but feel a fully combined league would make it a little stronger/wealthier.\n\nI follow Glentoran in the NIFL. We are mostly Unionist support but our supporters are open to the idea of an all Ireland dimension of some sorts.\n\nThe biggest sticking point is the 4 European places. Europe brings in a combined total of a few million GBP which is an awful lot of money for clubs. Winning the league means the running of a club for a few seasons so until that money is replaced somehow, it ain't gonna happen.\n\nI would love to see it. And an all island international team like in the rugby but I understand the reasons why it's unlikely. \n\nThe biggest issue with I actually foresee with an all island league would be the ultra republican arseholes from Cork, Dublin, Limerick etc using it as an opportunity to cause trouble in unionists areas and the same with ultra unionist arseholes using an away game to cause trouble. I hope I'm wrong.\n\nI've been all over Ireland following the Glens in Setanta. We got offered a fair dig by the Shamrock fans lol but they were the hooligan element and had no interest in going to the game  We had some bother in Galway and Bohemians but nothing the Gardai couldn't sort.\n\nThere are genuine fans all over tbh. Security is not the issue. \n\nI'd love to see an all Ireland trophy but again, it's the European places and money that mean so much. You get over ¬£1m from Europe for winning the league plus the fans get a great trip - I was in Malta last year in the Europa Conference League.\n\nPeople want it and there's good arguments to be made for it, but it really couldn't happen unless there was only 1 country. While the situation here is always improving, there's people on both sides who hold onto their values and beliefs like a bag of gold. \n\nLogistically it would.be a nightmare, what flag would the team who wins the league play in European competition under, what national anthem, etc.,\n\nAlso it would take a lot of work, more than the Good Friday agreement took to get the Football Association of Ireland (Republic of Irelands organisation) and the Irish Football Association (Northern Irelands and the original football association on the Island) to come to any agreements. Nutjobs on both sides in high positions.\n\nEdit: That's my opinion on it anyway.\n\n[deleted]\n\nThey very famously staged a revolution to leave the United Kingdom\n\n[deleted]\n\nNah it was based\n\nYou should join Azerbaijan \n\nSee how stupid that sounds ?  \n\nThat's you\n\n2 reasons\n\nSo that people would go to matches when the English premiership is off and the weather is better for it. A lot of grounds are not good during the winter and no one goes \n\nAnd because it gives our teams a running start at European matches, same as Norway, teams are playing teams from countries just getting their seasons started, but ours are in full peak swing\n\n[The only appropriate response.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuGiK-X9-0A)\n\nSo are Sweden, Norway and Finland.

Is that hard to comprehend?\n\nWhat relevance does the size of a country have to the context of the club?\n\nCan you differentiate between Club size and Club's Crest size?\n\nI mean the club crests being the size of the country gives them extra visual significance when there is none. Zenit is massive because Russia is massive, Man City is small because England is small. Imo it would be better if all the crests were the same size placed in the centre of each country."

    "all_comment_text": "Saying this to him just before a cup final is wild. A proper disasterclass incoming.\n\n[deleted]\n\nThat's better actually. The caretaker will actually want to win, he'll have something to prove and maybe try and get the full time job. Tell the current manager he's getting sacked after though and why would he even care? He's not going to put his usual effort into tactics etc. so it's just screwing over the team.\n\nHe‚Äôd care because this is his career and livelyhood. No manager is going to throw a cup final. That‚Äôs what everyone is in the game for. Ridiculous logic\n\nAlso sacking a manager just after a big cup win makes the owners look worse than the manager, almost regardless of the rest of the season.\n\nI mean look at the revisionism of LVG's time nowadays and a lot of that stems from people feeling bad about the way he was sacked.\n\nWhere exactly did I say he was going to ‚Ä≥throw‚Ä≥ it?\n\nI said he wouldn't put in as much effort as normal. He's still a professional and he'll do his job, but that's it. He's not going to go above and beyond like he normally would. Would you? If it was your last day at a job, even if you were leaving on good terms, would you do everything possible to succeed or would you just do what's necessary then go home? Not ridiculous logic at all.\n\n&gt;Would you do everything possible to succeed\n\nIf winning/losing made the difference between my next job being a CL team or a mid table team, yes absolutely. \n\n&gt;Not ridiculous logic at all.\n\nYes, it is. And says a lot about your work ethic and professionalism; or lack thereof.\n\nThe ridiculous thing is that you compare it to a normal job. Noone cares about your last day at work and your next boss will not know how much work you put in. \nComparing that to a game that is broadcasted to a billion people, lol.\n\nIt‚Äôs not like his usual effort won‚Äôt get us turned over per usual.\n\nHave you considered telling after?\n\nThat wouldn't be as bad. But that's not what they did for either Mourinho or ten Hag.\n\nTen Hag will want to win either way, it's a cup final. You can't be serious. What manager would ever throw a final for a serious trophy\n\nRight? What a ridiculous statement. Managers want trophies just as much as players do. He still has a long career ahead of him and throwing an important match like that would make getting his next job much harder.\n\nüòÜ ü§£ üòÇ üòπ\n\nDoes ten hag put effort into tactics?\n\nThat's exactly what they want to happen, they'll be criticised more if they sack a manager who won two cups in his first two seasons, despite his hands being tied behind his back due to all the injuries. ETH will want to win, though, he'll find it easier to find a big job.\n\nYou think Jose Mourinho would enter a cup final not wanting to win?\n\nThis aged well. Who the hell would want to lose on purpose?\n\nI mean, not sure how much of a chance utd ever had in this final. Pep‚Äôs gonna pull out all the stops since the season is over and this is the last chance at silverware this year\n\nEdit: this comment aged terribly but I think we were all shocked by that result\n\nYeah united won !\n\nWhat are you talking about? Every manager needs to win titles if they want to get the biggest jobs. He's not going to sabotage his own record just to mess over the club.\n\nQuite sure the out going manager wants to win even bigger and don't care about what the players complain about or who plays\n\nOr half-time like Spurs did with Martin Jol.\n\nIt's well known we sacked him to distract people from the Super League\n\nThat was Levy didn‚Äôt want to pay him a bonus just in case they won. Shit house owner for a shit house club\n\ndo people actually believe this?\n\nWhat other reason is there?\n\nIt's only a rumor and not from a reliable source either. It's highly unlikely the club said that to him before a final.\n\nI‚Äôm a little bit skeptical because the source is the mirror. The glazers are scumbags but until I see a tier 1 confirmation I‚Äôm gonna go ahead and assume this is bullshit.\n\nOh wow. My comment didn't age well. Fair play Ten Hag.\n\nAre you sure?\n\nI don't know. A few million of a payoff secured in his back pocket and basically a free hit to go for the win with whatever tactics and players he wants. And if he wins the game he'll have a new job within a month and still pocket the 2 years salary payoff from Utd. \n\nI'd say he is absolutely fired up by the news this morning\n\nThat‚Äôs Uli Hoene√ü Masterclass\n\nVan Gaal learned he was sacked just after getting the trophy though. This is much more civilised, IMO.\n\nYou were saying?\n\nSike 2-1!!! UNITED UNITED\n\nSome sources have claimed he was told before the Arsenal game so I think it‚Äôs possible that WE know about it now but that he‚Äôs known about it for longer\n\nIf you believe it, what's he gonna do, not bother with tactics? Set up an unbalanced team? Because I don't think I'd notice the difference.\n\nIt‚Äôs beautiful\n\nWhy he won. No pressure at all, and a big fuck you. It‚Äôs the owners who are responsible for the decline of Man Utd\n\nHe should do a disaster class and concede 15 goals. What a way to end his run.\n\nDo a greatest hits and lose it 7-0\n\nThen 4-0 in the second half\n\nWhy not both?\n\nWe could call that \"doing a Sunak\"\n\nHe will get 2-0 or so without competition, and thats it.\n\nThat would be on par and not too surprising, he should win 15-0 /s\n\nSo just do a normal game on his standards\n\nMake it 115 goals and it's a deal.\n\nHe should show up in a wig and shithouse a 1-0 win before ripping off his shirt to reveal a six pack painted, ‚ÄùWho is the bald fraud now peppy boy?‚Äù\n\nMake it 115 goals and we have a deal.\n\nThe original guardian article this article is based off doesn‚Äôt claim Ten Hag has been told anything. It claims the decision has been made but not that Ten Hag has been told which would seem cruel.\n\nThis seems like the mirror trying to generate clicks.\n\nYour comment should be higher. A lot of ppl here don't realise this article is not 100% credible.\n\nI hope he doesn‚Äôt read the papers lol\n\nI mean if the guardian are reporting a decision has been made then a spokesperson/rep of the club has more or less briefed them. Ten Hag not being told but the club saying it is just as bad\n\nNot really. The guardian article was from a Chelsea journalist I believe? Jamie Jackson reported something vague but he has been unreliable for years now.\n\nFair enough. Assumed the guardian would hold themselves to higher standards considering this wasn‚Äôt even on the gossip column, it was a report in and of itself\n\nSadly Jackson falls well short. I rate the guardian but his coverage always irks me a bit.\n\nYeah that‚Äôs a bit disappointing to be fair. I‚Äôll keep that in mind\n\nThe story was coming from Chelsea ITKs in the beginning of the week, not from United. Poch leaving on 'mutual consent'. This sounds like he's been approached for the job already.\n\nManchester united generate clicks.\n\nand people on reddit trust everything after first glance doesn't help\n\nSeem cruel? I think it's way worse to say you're fired whether you win or not. \n\nIf he still has a contract at least he'll get big money. Ah, the life in the hot seat.\n\nI'd show up for the final in nothing but tighty whities. Fuck it.\n\nDress up as Jimmy S\n\nNow then... Now then\n\n[removed]\n\nFront office problems be like:\n\nAssholes, I'd put myself in goal.\n\nEras come to an end.\n\n,\n\nWhat now boy???? I marked this comment to come back to? What now????????? ü§îü§îü§îü§îü§îü§îü§îü§î\n\nSome people really can't look at things beyond what's right in front of them huh.\n\nNumerous reports that he is being sacked regardless.\n\nIts not entirely his fault\n\nIndeed. Much like the person who loses a one-legged ass-kicking contest, there‚Äôs other factors that can be blamed. \n\nHowever, he still lost a one-legged ass-kicking contest.\n\nNot entirely but also quite a bit. Rangnick was right though, they need surgery at every level of that club.\n\nI‚Äôm a Celtic fan looking in from the sideline, don‚Äôt have any allegiance down there, and looking in from my view there‚Äôs a solid 5 year plan of ripping out the dross in the club and building it back up that‚Äôs desperately needed. Rangnick got 6 months baby sitting to tell them as much, and it was ignored.\n\nCasemiro last season with what seems to be the last he had in him, Rashford for 15 games or so turning into the player cunts think he threatens to be papered over a hell of a lot.\n\nDon't you just hate man u \n\n\nFrom a united fan\n\nLets be real. What other outcome was there?\n\nHope Bayern hasn't committed to Kompany yet. ETH would be a much better fit.\n\nHe couldn't manage united egos and you seriously think he could manage the mighty Bayern egos who have won everything there is,he is not the man for bayern.\n\nI said he is a BETTER fit than Kompany. Which he is. By miles. \n\nAlso what Man United egos other than specifically Ronaldo? What on earth does that entire Man u squad have to be egotistical about?\n\n&gt;specifically Ronaldo?\n\nSancho,Rashford and to some extent Granacho\n\nI personally thought he dealt with sancho and Ronaldo pretty well. Don‚Äôt want to play here? Off you fuck then.\n\nHe did. People comment but don‚Äôt know the situation at all. He handled it extremely well\n\nEdit: I realize he didnt sign Ronaldo. I think he mishandled him by not playing him because he was better than what they had in the squad. Sorry for making a mistake guys. Damn. \n\n100% agreed on Sancho.\n\nTen Hag didn't sign Ronaldo\n\nRonaldo was signed under OGS not ETH.\n\nI know.\n\nDumb comment. He did sancho so many favors. Had nothing to do with egos at all.\n\nSancho - no.\n\nRashford - been shit.\n\nGarnacho - been consistent this season? What problems has he had?¬†\n\nAntony\n\nYou what? Antony's ego? Antony is just shit.\n\nYes I know. ETH brought him in like he was something special.\n\nMaybe he didn‚Äôt handle sancho well but it seemed like sancho was the problem. \n\nHe benched Alejandro and rashford when they broke team rules and seems to have a good relationship with both of them. Alejandro has played 30+ matches in a row so I don‚Äôt see the logic there.\n\nNo one can manage United at the moment it‚Äôs clearly a shit show behind the scenes. I fail to see how it‚Äôs ETH fault when he only got 2 years to turn the team around. He reached an FA cup final this season and they‚Äôve been inconsistent but definitely improved team. He would be great for Bayern I bet. Honestly I don‚Äôt think any player or manager should go to United it‚Äôs like purgatory and you aren‚Äôt gonna be looked at in a positive light when you leave no matter what you achieve. I mean look at the Jadon sancho situation leaves in January and has a brilliant half season for Dortmund.\n\n&gt;Honestly I don‚Äôt think any player or manager should go to United it‚Äôs like purgatory and you aren‚Äôt gonna be looked at in a positive light when you leave no matter what you achieve\n\nThis couldn't be said enough. It's a graveyard for players AND managers.\n\nNor could Ole, Ragnarek, Jose, LVG, and Moyes‚Ä¶\n\nYou are aware that Ten Hag has already worked at Bayern right? Both as an coach for Bayern II and as an assistant coach. He knows the structure better than most available coaches, hell he even knows most players that play there.\n\nWhy would you think kompany is a better fit lol\n\nTime to drop the idea Haag is a good manager, he isn't\n\nWell that's a motivational nugget of news for the teams planning this week wtf üòÇ\n\nSo INEOS are proving to be as incompetent as the Glazers.\n\nMeet the new boss, same as the old boss.\n\nWell‚Ä¶ I mean, what can we even say here? He wasn‚Äôt even at fault all the time. \n\nJust a disastrous management followed by some of the shittiest performances from the boys.\n\nThey've also had some hectic injuries. Ending the season with casemiro and a re-signed Jonny Evans at CB\n\nWhen I judge him on the season, I do look through the lenses of injuries. If it were a Chelsea situation where even though we were dross, the underlying number plus the eye test showed some promise, I‚Äôd be all for him. I don‚Äôt just look at our final league position and bin him but it‚Äôs *how* it panned out: shit tactical structure, shit in game management, favoritism and tactical rigidity. I don‚Äôt think we would‚Äôve fared *much* better even without the injury crisis. \n\n\nAll in all, he was dealt a bad hand, yes but he handled it in the worst way possible.\n\nTotally agree\n\nStill remember another dutch former united-manager ([Louis van Gaal](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-4127896/Ex-Man-Utd-boss-Louis-van-Gaal-head-noose.html)) said winning the FA-cup with United was his greatest achievement as manager. Could be such a thing for Ten Hag.\n\nImagine he just doesn‚Äôt show up, like fuck you im not coming. Unfortunately he probably too professional for that.\n\nHe needs to play the youth team. Can‚Äôt believe another manager is going before the shit stain players we have\n\nWell‚Ä¶this is awkward‚Ä¶\n\nTbh the chance of Man Utd winning the cup final is between zero and zero.\n\nSo, you‚Äôre saying there‚Äôs a‚Ä¶. Oh no. You‚Äôre not.\n\nYour comment hasn't aged well.\n\nscripted\n\nYour comment hasn't aged well.\n\nIsn‚Äôt hindsight wonderful, City didn‚Äôt turn up for the first half and Man Utd probably had their best game of the season. I wonder how many of the Man Utd team were playing to try and not get sacked in the end of season clear out.\n\nTbh the MU management is gambling. They are hoping for ETH to just lose the final in a normal and expected way, but what if he loses like 0 to 10 or even won the game? In both cases (especially the latter) will give the club a great shame.\n\nIf he does win it, he'll leave with an EFL Cup, and FA cup. That's better than most. It's just the results have been shit.\n\nLVG left after winning the cup and there was no shame there.\n\nBye bye ten hag\n\nHe deserves it. United finishing a PL season with negative goal difference is beyond unacceptable, it would've been unthinkable a short while ago.\n\nIf we had a fully fit squad we would‚Äôve came fourth. There‚Äôs only a 3 win difference between us and villa\n\nBeing waiting on this¬†\n\ngame difficulty: beginner\n\nI just wouldn't turn upüòÇ,I'd pack my bags and get the hell out of here!!\n\nIf I was told that and I was ten hag I wouldn‚Äôt even turn up to the final tomorrow.\n\nMan United have made history folks, 50 goals concede... What is this? Omg, the manager is running on the pitch naked.\n\nMmm mmm. Disrespectful as hell. \n\nSign of the times lol.\n\nThat‚Äôs one way to motivate your manager‚Ä¶\n\nIs he taking memethony with him ???\n\nStupid decision\n\nNo way they actually told him that. What kind of shit tier is this?\n\nHow does this leak now? Unless it‚Äôs been widely known internally for weeks?\n\nWe remain an absolute clown show\n\nAhhh, so this is how you‚Äôre supposed to motivate people, I‚Äôve had it wrong for decades.  A sincere apology to all the managers I tried to motivate over the decades.  How could I have got it so very wrong!  üôÑ\n\nSo dumb\n\nWatch egbhali swoop in his him for Chelsea. Gulp.\n\nThis shit show is just a repeat of what happend to Van Gaal.. Except at least back then we knew it was becuse mourinho was avalible.. If this ends up with us getting Southgate or some shit... I'm done\n\nHe should name himself on the teamsheet and play in goal\n\nWhy are people just assuming this is true?\n\nAsking myself the same thing.\n\nIt's the Mirror, well known for being the most reliable source of news, right after the Sun and Telegraph\n\nThere‚Äôs a right way to end things, then a wrong way‚Ä¶\n\nKinda of a bad time to say it, if it is true. Also the market for managers seem to be pretty dry, and Chelsea looking for a manager as well makes it a little harder.\n\nSuch a perfect picture for the headline\n\nWho will take over?\n\nGlazers out!\n\nThe only that tops this is if they sign Southgate!!!!\n\nHis press conference as he‚Äôs leaving, still brings up the Garnacho pen against Arsenal.\n\nGood\n\nImagine get sacked before a final.\n\nKlopp is available\n\nI'm sure you're not being serious.\n\nOh, yeah? Then, I‚Äôd quit‚Ä¶. Like NOW.\n\nF- the disrespect.\n\nI wouldn't, I'd take the sacking, and the Glazer's money and then go on a really long vacation. He's earned it.\n\nSource is Trust me bro\n\nSo he loses on purpose or what. Brilliant new United Management\n\nLads, it‚Äôs the Mirror.\n\nRegardless of that happens tomorrow, this is Dave down‚Äôt pub.\n\nJust like Louis van Gaal years ago.\n\nOnly difference is, he wasn't told before the FA cup final.\n\nGreat motivation\n\ncity fan daughter v united fan dad. this weekend‚Äôs gonna be fun\n\nMan this is like 2014-2022 Ferrari, cycling though managers to find some sort of stability. \n\nHopefully they find their Fred Vassuer soon\n\nIts crazy he isnt already sacked in the first place. ManU is still one of the biggest clubs in the history of this game. Injuries didnt help him this season but rock bottom has been achieved. This is coming from an ajax and therefore ten hag fan but he failed. I do think manU as a club is ruining players and staff at the moment but the fact remains that lack of succes should decide his fate.\n\nIt's interesting because despite everything if he wins in the final he would have gotten them 2 trophies in two seasons. \n\nAnd I'm in the firm believe that despite some obvious lapses in judgement with his targeted signings he's had so many injuries It's ridiculous to say it was entirely his fault. And they are likely to cycle through mangers until the cows come home in the hope that they strike gold when the whole organization needs a Little restructuring, the stadium needs work, and the players need to be healthy.\n\nPlease sign Anthony for what ever team ten hag ends up at.\n\nChelsea to Europa league confirmed\n\nNo, actually. Make that Conference play-offs.\n\nThis is disgraceful. Ten haag deserves more time atleast 3 more years.\n\nApparently\n\nHe should patch the waterfall, then accept his sacking.\n\nFINALLY\n\nOh yes , The Guardian , the source of truth we must trust\n\nErik Zero Hag. \n\nMan U keep changing managers like it‚Äôs snot tissue paper. At this rate, even janitors outlast managers.\n\nHis time at Old Trafford is eerily similar to Uni Emery at Arsenal. A good manager who over performed their xG metrics in the first season before everything falls apart in the 2nd season.\n\nJust been a bad fit of the wrong manager at the wrong team at the wrong time.\n\nBeing a barca fan randomly coming across a united post, I'm happy to see we're not the only ones in a pile of shit üíú\n\nHow to motivate a manager üòÇüòÇüòÇü§°ü§°ü§°\n\nIf they told him a week earlier than I‚Äôm pretty sure Bayern Munchen would have taken Ten Hag over Kompany. So just this one week took away a golden opportunity for him. Even a return to Ajax is of the table since this week as they also have appointed a new coach.\n\nIt‚Äôs also bad business for United as now they have to pay the full amount to Ten Hag when they fire him. Otherwise they could probably have lowered that severance package. Now I hope Erik is going to ask for every last pound.\n\nDoesn‚Äôt take away that Erik definitely is to blame for the bad form. Yes the long list of injuries is unlucky but still it‚Äôs one incoherent bunch on the pitch. And Erik has no clue and is just staring to it on the sideline. Awful to watch for the fans. This coming from an Ajax fan btw.\n\nDidn‚Äôt he just say the board has common sense not to sack him? LOL\n\nAnother massive pay off for a failed manager, how do they keep getting jobs, manager like lampard, Rooney, even higher up tuchel and podg, they fail and just get another job, it's insane, look at Jessie marsch ffs, and kompany to Munich after getting Burnley relegated it's just madness.\n\nSure ETH will be back at a big club soon his failure rewarded with a big job and a massive pay off.\n\n6:0 for Citeh incoming. Foden Hattrick at least\n\nThat's a bit off.\n\nand I‚Äôm glad it is\n\nManchester United really are cunts!\n\nThat is why, despite the financial improprieties, I will still always support City in a derby.\n\nIf I was ETH, I‚Äôd field a squad of youth players lol\n\n2 years too late..\n\nEveryone re-reporting the same source.\n\nI‚Äôm calling BS\n\n‚ÄúRight so Harry you‚Äôre playing rush goalie‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\nJust give Alex Ferguson some amphetamine. He just win another one and then die as a winner.\n\nOr MU will die sooner\n\nHe should reverse his lineup so strikers are GK and defender and have literal children in the midfield\n\nWell this is awkward‚Ä¶\n\nNot working out is a better term..\n\nThis aged well\n\nHe should stay!\n\nit was absolutely ridiculous the referee should be banned for match fixing"

Think he might have let the odd 4 year old score, but by the time you were 6 he took no prisoners.\n\nThe odd thing is he let some adult fans score by purposely diving the wrong way\n\nYou're so shit David James let you score¬†\n\nHaving aura so weak he feels pity.\n\nSome opposition strikers too\n\nAnd his own defenders. And himself.\n\nHonestly that is just cool\n\nunfathomably based\n\nReminds me of Fernando Alonso opening his own Go Kart circuit for kids in 2016, smoking a bunch of 12 year old in the first race then leaving\n\n[removed]\n\noh yes, a worse car for cutting grass, the aston martin is what expert gardeners recommend.\n\n[removed]\n\nMeanwhile Stake Sauber üêå\n\nVery interesting approach by them running an actual F2 Car in F1\n\nWell if Riccardo gone, let's see what VCARB really do\n\nI mean I agree but it was clear for me which car was less worse in austin. Alonso is going to enter the fast aging phase soon but until then I dont expect him to drop off by this much. stroll used to do p8, now p15.\n\nFernando Alonso is still racing? Isn't he like 80 in Racing age.\n\nHe is, but he's also holding his own pretty well. Currently 9th in the standings, the best of the drivers from the non-top teams by some margin (he's at 62 points, H√ºlkenberg behind has 29)\n\nAlonso even managed to get a few podiums last season, and then his team shat the bed. Defended like a madman against Hamilton in 2021 in Hungary as well.\n\n[removed]\n\nYep, that Monaco race was such a \"what if\"\n\n&gt;Alonso\n\n&gt;H√ºlkenberg\n\n&gt;Hamilton\n\nWhat year is it?\n\nGotta respect the Hulk. Getting kicked off the grid, coming back, and basically being the best midfield driver out there. (No I cannot qualify Alonso as a midfield driver).\n\nFernando is old yes but he‚Äôs still very good, consistently putting in a shift even in mediocre cars\n\nHe‚Äôs literally a rookie\n\nWorse car most weekends. But AM looked bottom of the midfield in COTA. Only Sauber were definitely worse\n\nI thought you said Marcos Alonso and thought that would be a pretty wild thing for him to do üíÄ\n\nLast time he was behind the wheel he killed his girlfriend.\n\nTo be fair, this just seems a lot more fun to be a part of as a kid than a goalie saving your pen twice and that's that.\n\nYeah I‚Äôd love to see him up close driving fast, and I don‚Äôt even care for F1\n\nHe probably couldn't drive so slow to not win\n\nWell done, he‚Äôs only 13\n\nGenuinely such a funny video, Owen top class shithousing a kid.\n\nI think Oliver Khan did something similar when he was still playing right.¬†\n\nJe saved 49/50 penalties. Each Goal would have donated 1000‚Ç¨ to charity.\n\nCame here for this comment üòÇ\n\nDavid James is Liverpool's answer to Michael Owen.\n\nDidn't they both play for Liverpool?\n\nWe'd better check with some Liverpool fans.\n\nCan confirm\n\nCan also confirm that Michael Owen and David James' names actually make a combination of 16 different names that all make sense in England.\n\nSurely 12? Unless you are counting Michael Michael, David David, etc?\n\nOf course! \n\nI went to school with an Adam Adams and Neville Neville is the father of Gary Neville so James James and David David are probably out there somewhere.\n\nIs David Davis close enough? \n\n  \n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David\\_Davis\\_(British\\_politician)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Davis_(British_politician))\n\nWhat about 3 word names? Michael David Owens etc.\n\nü§£ classic\n\nIt's just for fun with him I believe but the kid will definitely feel bad. He will grow up üòÇ¬†\n\nLamine Yamal was 16 while already considered one of the best players in the recent World Cup.\n\nNot only did he not play in the recent World Cup, but he also isn't representative of the average young football fan, believe it or not.\n\nConfidently wrong lol.\n\nOdd lie but okay\n\nKeeper‚Äôs doing his job\n\nFor once with James\n\nGit gud,  kid\n\nGame isn't gone lads\n\nThe world ain't all sunshine and rainbows.\n\nTeach 'em young.\n\nAye welcome to the real world kid hahaha\n\nEnglish Kahn\n\nI once heard an interview with kahn, if he has regrets in his career, and he mentioned a story exactly like this\n\nKhan without being good\n\nDecline the penalty. Take a corner or lofty free kick\n\nGary Pallister suddenly ambles by and knows what he needs to do.\n\nGames back, they gotta make James a mod on soccercirclejerk.\n\nCant believe he saved the second one after they let the kid retake it after he saved the first, madlad. He should have siuuuuud the kid lmao\n\nFuck them kids\n\nRelax diddy\n\n‚ÄúWake up in the morning, feeling like P Diddy.‚Äù\n\nhttps://youtu.be/iP6XpLQM2Cs?si=qJiK-gUQrDE4J6zq\n\nNo, let's not do that.\n\n\"I'm David James, bitch!\"\n\nIt was actually quite a Rick James thing to do.\n\n\"I think I'm bleeding from my chest\".\n\nThis is deeply funny to me. The fact people are arsed about it as well just makes it better.\n\nMichael Owen was doing similar at the peak of his career\n\n[game set and match, Owen](https://youtu.be/WqOxNspUPyE?feature=shared)\n\nWhat a shitbag üòÇ\n\nSurprised he didn't griddy tbh\n\nI remember David James wrote a Guardian column for a while and one of his columns was about him being an actual psychopath. I can‚Äôt remember the exact details now, I think maybe he read Jon Ronson‚Äôs book The Psychopath Test and self-identified.\n\nBut this tracks.¬†\n\nHe did a programme about it too. Fascinating and it sounds like it was a genuine thing.\n\nYeah there are a lot of people out there who have some psychopathic traits to them that will never know it.\n\nhonestly the most david james thing\n\nNothing wrong with that. We have to stop pampering kids.\n\nIf I was a kid at that age I'd have preferred it if James did his best. I think it's the same for most. Would have felt bad if he treated me like a 4 year old and let the ball go in.\n\nI hope he followed up the save with, \"Life sucks, it's all downhill from here kid.\" üòÇ\n\nWell done he‚Äôs 13\n\nI mean they called a pro in and it was a 'penalty competition ', not much of a competition if you let them all in is it? Just let them shoot into an open net if that's the point\n\nIt wasn‚Äôt a competition though was it\n\nI didn't see it live but in the article it says \"charity penalty shoot-out event\" which to me reads like a competition, but happy to be proven wrong if that's the case.\n\nIt was a little kid\n\nI've found the clip [here](https://youtu.be/Ma5EP5DKrVE?si=C2rNwfV_5em0xPRF)\n\nI'm all for it, the kid hit the penalty well, but not sure scoring past a keeper who lets it in means that much to be honest. Next time they can put mr blobby in goal and keep you all happy.\n\nBut it‚Äôs just a bit sad from him isn‚Äôt it? Dice the wrong way, im sure the kids body language is pretty obvious\n\nRepeating myself again but I'd rather give it my best and be beaten rather than be patronised. I mean if he was a 6 year old I take your point but meh.\n\nAnd it‚Äôs not you? It is a young kid lmao. I would also want to try and score myself, but this is a kid. Not either of us so the point is irrelevant.\n\nCan't be the only one who thinks patronising them by letting a terrible shot go in is actually better. Or am I?\n\nI agree with you to an extent, when its a kid you cant actually expect them to knock a penalty in against an ex pro at 11 years old.  Which makes it even weirder because he let in an adults penalty, should be the opposite way about - Make sure kid scores, give adult a fair shot.\n\nYeah. Pretty weird that he let another one in.\n\nSlammed\n\nHe let the adults score but not a child?\n\nImagine booking him and Michael Owen together¬†\n\nGiving kids an easy ride is why they expect everything as an adult\n\nAt least he didn't go down the Vinnie Jones route\n\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/OldSchoolCool/comments/va1x2v/vinnie_jones_tackling_a_5_year_old_1989/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=mweb3x&amp;utm_name=mweb3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button\n\nLike Jordan said, F them kids\n\nWu tang is for the children!\n\nWasn‚Äôt it Diddy who said that?\n\nOne of the few he ever saved, give calamity James a break.\n\nThe absolutely right thing to do. If everyone scores, nobody scores.\n\nLet the nipper who actually manages it feel like king and drink David James tears.\n\nHe's leading the path to greatness for a special individual.\n\nNo one has 'slammed' him, I personally applaud him. Kid should have done better\n\n[Never let kids get the best of you!!! Never](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=aYqjQ0CEmok)\n\nGames not gone\n\nKid should have scooped it, James would have fumbled it into the net.\n\nWell since he‚Äôs a vampire I‚Äôm glad they didn‚Äôt cross the ball\n\nSLAMMED\n\nAt half time at Arsenal young fans take penalties on Gunnersaurus. On the rare occasion he saves one, it is absolutely hilarious. \n\nLife is tough kids, best to find that out in a relatively friendly atmosphere.\n\nGood work with James foundation\n\nSounds like a skill issue\n\nKid gotta learn disappointments too.\n\nSometimes in the life ‚Ä¶\n\nKind of stuff I can get on board with, and it's fucking hilarious.\n\nThis Prick cost Liverpool a league title because he couldn‚Äôt take professional football serious enough and got addicted to video games.\n\nDon't be daft. He could've trained 18 hours a day and that's Liverpool team wasnt winning fuck all. The defence was shocking, there was zero depth and the management was subpar.\n\nCheck out the mistakes he made during the last 9 games and get back to me on that\n\nNah you shouldn‚Äôt make it too easy it loses the fun otherwise, what‚Äôs the point if you know you‚Äôre going to score anyway\n\nGames back\n\nMichael Owen all over again!!\n\nWait till someone lets Vinnie loose\n\nMaking up for lost times‚Ä¶.\n\nat least a ball he could save\n\nIt‚Äôs good it will teach the kid a valuable lesson life is tough and you don‚Äôt get what you want\n\nlol big deal he‚Äôs 13 not 5\n\nmost of the crowd were laughing in the video i saw\n\nGames the game.\n\ngames healing\n\nHe wasn‚Äôt slammed.. the Anfield crowd booed him but there was banter in it.. it‚Äôs character building for the lad lol\nJames will of done something nice for him behind the scenes he‚Äôs not an arsehole\n\nHe has gave the kid a better story, two penalties at Liverpool vs David James and he saved both but the crowd backed him up and boo‚Äôs him. \n\nNow the next wee boy who scores know he is trying to save it..\n\nHe must be admin of r/kidsarefuckingstupid\n\nI couldn't stop laughing when I watched that. I was like what's all this üòÇ üòÇ¬†\n\nCharacter building\n\nHe tried to for the second one. He dived early but his foot caught it.\n\nTbh it genuinely looked like a proper save! Might be good for the kid that he actually brought a decent save out of James\n\nNo mercy in this dojo.\n\nTeach them young\n\nOliver Kahn is proud\n\nend of the day the penalty taker still has the advantage. Well done David James.\n\nThis is like competitive dad in the fast show.\n\nI don't see anything wrong with that.\n\nTeaching them life ain't fair I'm all for it ü§£\n\nNa, it'll put hairs on the lads chest. A life lesson handed out from James that you don't always get what you want, lol.\n\nSome save to be fair\n\n\"They gonna learn today.\"\n\nLife lessonz\n\nIf only he was this good at saving shots during his actual career.¬†\n\nDid you not watch his career? Saving shots was never a problem for him, he was a beast.\n\nHe was nicknamed Calamity James at Liverpool.\n\nMostly for fumbling crosses and corners. I remember a joke about James and Dracula both being afraid of crosses.\n\nWhich had almost nothing to do with his ability to save shots. There are other things a goalkeeper has to do.\n\nAs someone who watched football intensely during this period, he was a good keeper, who made the odd mistake. You don't become first choice Liverpool and England goalkeeper for years by being poor.\n\nVery revisionist take there‚Äôs a reason we started winning trophies when westerveld took over as number one,a far superior keeper.\n\nNot revisionist at all, that's how I felt at the time. He made mistakes, dropped some clangers and got killed for it in the media. People remember the headlines.\n\nHe was England and Liverpool #1, played 214 games for Liverpool, 53 for England and 572 in the Premier League. I'm no fan of his, but a rubbish keeper does not play 572 Premier League games.\n\nTo be fair, he was legitimately very good for a few seasons at Portsmouth.\n\nTell me you never watched him without telling me you never watched him.\n\nLol I did. He had the stature and ability to be an okay PL goalkeeper, but there's a reason he didn't succeed with England and Liverpool. They were both beyond his level.\n\nHe had a great couple seasons with Portsmouth, got called up and a big transfer, and that's the best things ever got for him. Struggled terribly with the fundamental skill of catching a ball. Second balls from corners were a gift when James was in goal.\n\nHe was one of the best shot stoppers in the league during his career. Just don't ask him to handle a cross.\n\nThe kid will probably get a signed shirt, exec box  tickets, a pair of salahs boots off the back of this because the words gone soft. \n\nKid should look himself in the mirror and have a stern word if he can‚Äôt put a penalty past David fucking James‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.\n\nHe's precious little going for hm so he needs to take wins where he can"

He could probably force his way out of that happened anyway\n\nWell, in this case it could be highly relevant though.\n\nNot really as they don‚Äôt think they will be relegated so neither side will add it. Man city does not think they will be relegated and would not want to say they might and Haaland also does not think they will be and would not want to say it and anyway could force his way out if they were.\n\nMate, I don't think haalands agents are too shy to mention this üòÇ\n\nI think they would mentioning it serves nothing. They wont think they will be relegated and even if they were they could force their way out so all it moght do is cause offence or make them look silly to their team\n\nThink... Is really irrelevant. That's a probability matter.  10 %risk of going down? Might as well have a clause about it. Teammates won't read through the contract, so noone cares about clauses.\n\nIt really isn‚Äôt‚Ä¶ proberbility wise its low enough they wont bring it up. Nope not might as well have a clause you could cause offence and its so low it just isn‚Äôt worth it. Plus again he could force his way out anyway. The club will and that will cause offence and maybe it gets leaked to the press that Haaland asks for relegation clause.\n\nIn fact the fact it hasn‚Äôt leaked at the dame time as his salary ask and release clause makes it unlikely it was discussed.\n\nCause offense? What do you think this is? \nHis agents don't give a fuck.\n\nThere are lots of clauses in their contracts and we don't hear about em.\n\nI mean they will as you dont want to needlessly cause offence in a negotiation.\n\nSomething this big would likely be leaked. Imo it was not even mentioned\n\nYa know about all the charges they have?\n\nYep but A Man Coty and Haaland mast think there‚Äôs little chance they will result in relegation B I don‚Äôt think it will result in a relegation. IF(and that‚Äôs a big if) they are found guilty they will at most imo get enough points deduction for them to not win the title and a transfer ban not a relegation\n\nIm not reading the article, but I can only assume that it includes a clause that for every goal he scores one of the charges against city gets dropped.¬†\n\nTransferred to Everton.\n\nthe double it and give it to everton clause\n\nYou mean the points deduction is transferred for Everton\n\nWith interest\n\nEvery Hat-Trick Sheffield United just get shat on no matter what league they‚Äôre in.\n\nHope he has a relegation release clause\n\nIdk, watching haaland smash in 170 goals in championship would be something\n\nIf they drop down to the Vanarama North, it‚Äôll be the same as every football manager YouTuber experiment.\n\nWdym my player who can play in all positions and have 20 for every attributes is not realistic üëÄ\n\nMore likely someone in the championship proper does him in.\n\nAs is tradition\n\nDunno like he's a big fucker\n\nLegs are legs\n\nNot robot legs\n\nInsert Roy Keane‚Äôs son in law breaking his knee off\n\nHave you seen the clip where Kimmich tried to swipe him when he was at Dortmund and ended up getting injured himself\n\nChamp boys will go in harder than Kimmich once they‚Äôre 8-0 down and have had enough.\n\nYou're saying championship defenders are better than Bayern Munich players?\n\nI‚Äôm saying championship defenders are more likely to say fuck it and go in for a challenge with no regard for what happens versus a player like Kimmich who will be putting more effort into making sure the challenge doesn‚Äôt get him into trouble\n\nThe most physical players at the summit of football have went off injured for trying a challenge on haland.

People here throw an absolute shit fit if you act like two cities in the UK who are a few miles apart are somewhat similar, but it's fine to treat two countries as the same because I can't tell the difference.\n\nI love how just cos we have Garry Lineker, Gay marriage and Men can be women. The west can play the ultimate top trump card to say we are the good guys you others are bad. \nHistorically we have a terrible human rights record and that was before we got rich of petrol chemicals too. \nIf you‚Äôve read this far, you know it has nothing to do with football. \nIsn‚Äôt the 21st century great‚Ä¶ what a time to be alive. üòπ\n\nIdk man‚Ä¶i really value freedom of expression, and in the west we generally do a better job of letting ppl do that. Sure, we have faltered, especially lately more than I‚Äôve expected, but in general we let ppl do what they please more than theocracies. I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs something to be appreciated extremely heavily. \n\nI mean hell women couldn‚Äôt even drive in Saudi Arabia up until recently, and good for them for enacting that change. \n\nTbf i understand part of your sentiment tho, westerners calling all others the same is bonkers.\n\nYes, apart from Israel, every other country has poor Human rights record. Also exclude the west\n\nNone of them are the same. (If you‚Äôre trying to act all morally high ground)\n\nTell that to Bentancur\n\nAnd they'll defend that this isn't racism\n\nIm sure Mheikh Sansour has nothing to with city\n\nIt comes from a Mr Ruosnam. He comes from, someplace far away, yes that'll do.\n\nComing from complete ignorance here, but why do you say that? Is this part of city trying to hide how much money they are splashing from the governing bodies?\n\nBecause rivals fans try their best to find happiness in made up stupid claims. I‚Äôm sure his response to city being a current football juggernaut is ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt care‚Äù while commenting on every thing city related\n\nGives an out I guess\n\nHaaland has always been about release clauses, they've helped him make most of his money\n\nThe only reason we would have paid a previous manager more money than stated is to get around ffp.\n\nWe are nowhere near close to breaking any rules for player wages, there'd literally be no need to do what you're suggesting.\n\nIf we wanted to give him a million a month, we wouldn't need to hide that.\n\n[deleted]\n\nYes, for when that would have benefitted us.\n\nWare one of the richest teams in the world now.\n\n115mio per year, for 115 years\n\nSham of a club. Sold their soul years ago\n\nAs someone who hasn't followed football closely in a while - with the exception of World Cup and Euros - why do you and other commenters say this?\n\nSold out to UAE. Facing 115 charges for financial cheating to get around ffp (inc peps brother owning half of Genoa (city group club) for no reason). City group owns a number of clubs that they use as part of financial doping (eg Melbourne city can't afford to pay man city 1M yearly for 'player data'\n\nDon't forget Pep the notorious drug cheat\n\nAh, thanks for explaining - I literally had no idea! Anyone that aligns with the UAE cannot be trusted, imo. I hadnt heard of the term financial doping before and have just gone down a rabbit hole reading about this activity. \n\nSo i'm guessing everyone knows about this dodgy Man City behaviour and they are super unpopular? (which would explain why I'm getting down voted just for asking the question üòÜ)\n\nThey were bought by UAE in 2008 and have been explicitly cheating ever since. Financial doping, breaking financial rules, setting up the Super League. One of the biggest cheats in world football alongside their fellow Super League clubs.\n\nThey were bought in 2008 by the UAE and then hired the mostly influential people while Barca were at their peak. IFTFY. Sure, their finances are shady but you cant say they‚Äôre not run well\n\nThere‚Äôs being ‚Äúrun well‚Äù and there‚Äôs being ‚Äúrun by cheats with a history of avoiding accountability‚Äù. Their owners are on record as saying they‚Äôd rather spend ¬£50m or lawyers than pay a ¬£30m fine. They‚Äôre not run well in the slightest. They‚Äôre cheats.\n\nWell, if you ain't cheatin', you ain't tryin'... /s\n\nIf they were your club you wouldn‚Äôt be saying any of this. Get the jealousy out of you\n\nMy club, Leicester City, is the only club to have won anything fairly in England for the last decade. \n\nWe won the Premier League fair and square. FFP - brought in at the behest of the ‚Äúbig six‚Äù clubs - meant that we couldn‚Äôt compete after this as the rules at the time (Short Term Cost Control) meant we couldn‚Äôt spend more than 7% on players than the previous season. As we‚Äôd finished 14th in 2014/15, we were only allowed to spend like a bottom half club instead of like champions in 2016. Literally banned from competing with the ‚Äúbig six‚Äù. \n\nSTCC ended in 2019 which is when Leicester started to properly compete, finishing 5th in two seasons, winning the FA Cup and Community Shield, reaching the semi finals of the League Cup and Europa Conference League. \n\nIn the midst of this, Man Utd and Liverpool tried to introduce Project Big Picture which would have given themselves even more disproportionate money and power they already get. When that failed, they clubbed together with the rest of the ‚Äúbig six‚Äù to try and set up the European Super League that was designed to destroyed every domestic competition as well as bankrupt every other club in Europe. \n\nWhen that failed the Premier League introduced PSR, which for Leicester and every other ambitious club, meant they couldn‚Äôt compete with the ‚Äúbig six‚Äù because their expenditure was too high compared to their profits. Profits are controlled by the Premier League‚Äôs broadcasting deal which extorts UK consumers and deliberately gives the bigger clubs more screen time and therefore more exposure to sponsors and merchandising. \n\nMeanwhile, Manchester City‚Äôs Europe ban being overturned by CAS meant that Leicester didn‚Äôt qualify for the Champions League for two seasons, ended up losing out on hundreds of millions of pounds, and in trying to comply with PSR, harmed themselves on the pitch by not spending anything and ended up relegated. When the Premier League find Manchester City guilty - and they will - Leicester will be entitled to half a billion in compensation.\n\nTL;DR:\n\nNo, I am not jealous of these clubs. They have repeated cheated my club out of fair competition.\n\nBecause they're jealous. The club was far worse before 2008.\n\nIt‚Äôs 90% jealousy\n\nare city the most pointless football club ever, they have good players but their coach is a fraud and the club as a whole is soulless\n\nDead eyed, empty fans too \n\nStadium ~~full~~ half full of paid actors\n\nEmptyhad\n\nAnd it‚Äôs such a shame because City fans used to be such a hilarious, self-deprecating, lovely bunch. The problem is that fans who had that kind of culture before aren‚Äôt the kind of fans that can go and truly enjoy all the plastic success they‚Äôve had.\n\nthey had some proper scum fans back in the day playing lower league they smashed up our city center with families and kids around on a saturday afternoon shopping instead of meeting up away from ground with rest of the bellends. Most current fans wont remember those days\n\nWatched them since the 80s and have loved every minute, thanks\n\nSuch a bunch of losers whoever downvoted this..\n\nHahaha the pure desperation to make yourself feel better for supporting a trash club that can‚Äôt keep up to ours üò≠\n\nStaying hating\n\nLooking forward to watching him play against Alty in the Conference next season\n\nHaaland at Real, Mbappe at City. Perfect exchange.\n\nNo fucking thankyou\n\nHaaland has the perfect chance to position himself against Mbappe if he goes to Barca or something, but they can‚Äôt afford him probably.\n\nDe jongs on ¬£600k/week??? Surely that cant be right\n\nTechnically yes, but these are deferred wages. He helped barca when they were struggling financially.\n\ni thought he was coming to barca next year üòîüòî\n\nThat would be a big step down\n\nThat's fine, as long as they wait till the summer before getting a six. They don't have to win it every year. Next year is fine.\n\nWhy even bother with a huge release clause? who can even sign him? the Monstars will come from space and snag him up?\n\nNewcastle is owned by literally Saudi Arabia, for example. Paris-Saint Qatar is always flush with cash. Or Dhabi Football Group can just launder some money by sending him to New York City. ü§∑üèª\n\nCan he not go somewhere else ?\n\nAnd a relegation release clause too no doubt.\n\n‚ÄúThe ex-Molde and RB Salzburg hitman..‚Äù\n\nImagine you lack so much football knowledge that you miss to mention CL finalists..\n\nClick bait! Just tell us in the title ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\n\nHow tf ia De Jong no ¬£600.000 a week. Wild.\n\nIs one of their other clubs going to pay them ¬£500m for release and them loan him back for just his wages?\n\nA salary as big as his head!\n\nBut cules here were telling me he was going to Barca next year, lol.. What's up with that?\n\nWhen does his current contract run until?\n\n\nI find it interesting that the club is offering a new contract to him just before any rulings are reached by the independent commission - and will Haaland sign it before any rulings, or will he wait until that is sorted?\n\nI‚Äôm too lazy to check, because it won‚Äôt happen. City will be found of something at Xmas and Erling will be gone by next season\n\nHe should worry about Gyokeres instead, who‚Äôs gonna take world football by storm, through humility.\n\nSomething something 115 charges¬†\n\nBut can he score in a game that actually matters?\n\nWell from such a reputable source this has to be true\n\nI thought the FA didn't allow release clauses on contracts.\n\nRelease clauses are allowed, Olise left Palace this summer when Bayern triggered his and Bruno G at Newcastle had a very well publicised one for ¬£100m that ended in June this year.\n\nOh! I always thought other leagues didn't allow that besides the Spanish one.\n\nAny league allows them. They're just mandatory in Spain so are in all contracts there. For most countries it's just if the player/club agree to it.\n\nMandatory in Brazil too, but the mandatory ones only apply to other Brazilian clubs, release clauses to foreign clubs are still optional though.\n\nThey're illegal in France, but beyond that i think they're legal everywhere else.\n\nI think they're mandatory in Spain, and optional everywhere else.\n\nThe sooner we get rid of these cheats\n\nCraziest thing about this article is that Frenkie De Jong is on 600 grand a week, more than our entire Villa midfield combined, and he wouldn't even start.\n\nHe is better than every player in your midfield but ye over paid asf\n\nLmao, is he fuck. Barca were nearly crying begging him to reduce his wages or sell him a year ago. Bros got 25 goal contributions in 155 games and getting paid 50% more than KDB LMAO\n\nYou do realize he has played as a deep midfielder most of his Barca career? Even when Barcelona tried to offload him fans were screaming that he was their best midfielder, it was 100% a financial reason.\n\nSo do u watch football or just comment on subs as a ragebait\n\nTypical prem fan. Know absolutely nothing about other leagues and still shits on them\n\nFancy saying FDJ wouldn‚Äôt get in the villa squad. I know you‚Äôre doing well right now but let‚Äôs not be silly.\n\nHe'd get in the squad but he isnt starting ahead of Onana, Kamara, or Tielemans. Villas CM / CDM position is the strongest of our entire squad by far, and currently the strongest midfield in the entire Prem with Rodri / Odegard injured.\n\nTell me you don‚Äôt watch him play without telling me you don‚Äôt want him play. He‚Äôd walk into your first team.\n\nYeah he would, this is what gives prem fans a bad rep ffs\n\nBro , really. Do other thing. Football isn‚Äôt your thing\n\nTielemans being better than de jong is definitely an opinion\n\nmate\n\nWhich is partly compensation for receiving less pay than promised during covid. (Deferred salary)\n\nBarca didn't pay his wages for a couple of years when they were struggling, he now gets deferred wages\n\nUntil city are found guilty perhaps? Then he's available for a cut price I'd assume.\n\n‚ÄúDailystar‚Äù ffs\n\nStay humble, eh ...\n\nCity's offshore accounts will be in overdrive."

    "all_comment_text": "It‚Äôs almost the same situation that happened in EL final last year, by the same ref-VAR combo. And they‚Äôre not the only two matches ruined by these two individuals (let‚Äôs not forget this season few week‚Äôs championship relegation for Taylor). These people are simply BAD at refereeing, they should be stopped for good. And yet, *the exact opposite* actually happens, they‚Äôre constantly praised as top quality referees. World is upside down.\n\nI‚Äôm confused what does this news have to do with last year‚Äôs EL final\n\nIt‚Äôs the same hand foul in the box that the same ref-var combo didn‚Äôt sanctioned with a penalty\n\nAh ok gotcha. Yeah the refereeing was quite bad that game but to be fair, and not to say that two wrongs make a right, but Roma‚Äôs goal also shouldn‚Äôt have stood, Cristante very clearly fouls Rakitic right in front of the ref before the counter attack starts. So yes all this to say he really is a shit ref.\n\nA good referee is the one you don‚Äôt notice is there. These people are basically the prima donna of every match they do\n\nThe sad truth\n\nWhen people that say \"all we want is consistency\" get it:\n\n\n\"Not like that\"\n\nWe want consistency and correct decisions. Consistently wrong is still wrong.\n\nHand foul\n\nI remember arguing with people on here who said Taylor had a great game in the EL final. I was flabbergasted. I understand football is about opinions but to say Taylor managed the EL final well is a white hot take.\n\nBecause we have few good ref?\n\nWhy do the refs have to be English? ¬†They get the best players from anywhere. Why not refs? ¬†\n\nAnd the inconsistency in spite of being able to have more uniform decisions on big calls with VAR is mind boggling. How is Wan Bissaka a handball Sunday but Grealish is ‚Äúa player pulling him arm in behind‚Äù on Saturday? ¬†\n\nThere is many ways it should be improved, i think AI will be the game changer, have 10 ref look at the handballs from the last 10 years and vote on it, and AI can take that choice and if the ref doesn't disagree that is the call.\n\n\nBut they should hire outside ref if it's possible and the talent pool is not good enough in england\n\nThink Taylor is a good referee in the main, easily the best the PL has got - but I think the PL needs to consider paying for the best refs around the world imo.\n\nI didn‚Äôt think it was possible anyone could think Anthony Taylor is a good referee, much less ‚Äúeasily the best the PL has got.‚Äù This is outright wrong. You haven‚Äôt seen enough of him if you feel that way.\n\nTaylor is as biased as they come. Shouldn't have a job\n\nI really struggle to name anyone better, though. Like seriously, which ref would you rather have?\n\nEither you‚Äôre on a wind up or you‚Äôre in the minority üòÇ\n\nHe‚Äôs certainly the best Premier League referee\n\nAhh yes, Taylor who's family are die hard United fans but of course, he's a Bolton fan. He refs the Manchester derby every year and if he has any opportunity to, he'll give decisions to United, for example the Bruno goal where Rashford was 10 feet offside.\n\nPeople were saying he‚Äôs from Manchester so tried to help city against Liverpool. Now he‚Äôs a United fan and tries to help United against city. \n\nReality is you lot just make up a load of bs on here\n\nI‚Äôd say it makes complete sense, a utd fan would rather city win than liverpool\n\nPierluigi Collina needs a regen ref\n\nThe ONLY bad word that can really be said about Collina was that his \"I used to study teams and study players\" comment is the complete opposite of what a ref ahould be doing. A foul is a foul, it doesnt magically become not a foul when its done to a different player based on what that player did in previoua games...\n\nIm probably not explaining it right. That comment has never sat right with me, especially to hear it coming from Collina himself...\n\nI get what you mean but at the same time referees study teams and players all the time. Studying teams is just a hard requirement to be able to ref games of even marginally higher level at all, considering the requirements of the modern game for positioning, game management and such. I imagine studying individual players is similarly needed when reffing true professional higher level football.\n\nThis is a wildly terrible take.\n\nReferees watch clips of teams and study players so that they know what to expect, not to pre-judge them.\n\nKnowing a team takes short corners, or long throw-ins, or that a player has a tendency to use elbows or fall down easily. All of that knowledge makes it *more likely to get decisions correct*.\n\nThe alternative would be to be actively ignorant of the teams and players you‚Äôre going be dealing with and expecting that to somehow work. That‚Äôs clearly absurd.\n\nCollins was a massively bent ref though\n\nEverton fan?\n\nYep!\n\nFair üò≠\n\nI'm so glad at least some people are looking at it in a non- brainwashed way. \n\nYes, tweeting does nothing and will only invite fines from the unaccountable dumbasses at the PGMOL, but at least NF said something about the referees bringing down the quality of the league. Pretty dumb move, but the motivation is correct.\n\nHonestly, it's amazing how people just parrot what famous \"personalities\" like Sky Pundits say and feel good about themselves.\n\nThis was always a possibility the second VAR was introduced and now it‚Äôs coming back to haunt them.\n\nI swear when they introduced VAR they said it was only going to be for ‚Äúclear and obvious‚Äù mistakes by the referee and since day one they‚Äôve been interfering with minor errors left right and centre\n\nOffsides are the worst, for me. You have ones like Coventry yesterday where the guy maybe had a toenail offside at best that wasn‚Äôt picked up on by the linesman because it was such a close decision and I don‚Äôt think United even appealed it - and it gets overruled. \n\nFor me personally, when it‚Äôs that close it should just go with the linesman and referees initial decision\n\nIn the Roma vs Milan game last week there was a potential handball flagged against Roma where I think Smalling jumped for a header and it kind of pinballed a little and hit him on the arm as he was coming back down. The pundits said ‚Äúoh yes that hit him on the arm so it‚Äôs a penalty‚Äù but the ref reviewed it and said ‚Äúno penalty‚Äù - and it was the correct decision, in my opinion, because he never moved his arm towards the ball, he had jumped for the header and as he was coming back down trying to balance himself the ball pinballed a little and hit his arm. Great, brave decision from that referee. But if that‚Äôs in the Premier League the referee gives a penalty 100% of the time because, in my opinion, they‚Äôre afraid to go against VAR and afraid of the potential backlash\n\nNot yesterday they didn't.\n\nYoung moved his arm towards the ball and changed the flight of it, nothing given\n\nOffside is the best thing about VAR. it‚Äôs so simple: if you are offside, you are offside. If you are not, you‚Äôre onside. It doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs a toenail - it‚Äôs offside.\n\nNo, that's just offside position. In the Coventry one it is also clearly an offside offense, but that requires that \"at the moment the ball is played or touched* by a team-mate [the offside player is] involved in active play\", which is all kinds of subjective. \n\nhttps://www.thefa.com/football-rules-governance/lawsandrules/laws/football-11-11/law-11---offside\n\nThat‚Äôs not subjective at all. The offside rule is the one clear thing about VAR. Whether you agree with it is a different issue, but don‚Äôt suggest it‚Äôs ambiguous.\n\nHow on earth do you get that idea? Have you never seen a player in an offside position who wasn‚Äôt committing an offside offense?\n\nThose situations are rare. This coventary one was very straightforward, given the player who was in an offside position literally assisted the goal.\n\nWell, yea. When it‚Äôs straightforward it‚Äôs not ambiguous. Maybe we should just get rid of the rest of the rule, then VAR really could be accurate every time.\n\nBrother, no offence but please don‚Äôt become a referee.\n\nWhat‚Äôs wrong, you don‚Äôt think referees should know more than you?\n\nNaaah bro. What's the margin for \"close\"? Offsides are clear cut binary: either offside or not. I felt for Coventry watching the match but it was offside as simple as that.\n\nSo are you seriously going to lie right now and say you could say with 100% certainty it was offside? Because if so, tell me exactly how much? You can‚Äôt\n\nNot a dumb move in anyway whatsoever. Forest should be absolutely applauded on behalf of football for having the balls to challenge\n\none thing the article leaves out is that Oliver is a UAE shill\n\nAll that Fly Emirates money for nothing.\n\nIt also leaves out that Forrest never asked for the VAR to be changed.\n\nThat‚Äôs such a weird thing for them to claim when it sounds like they didn‚Äôt even actually warn them. Like it wasn‚Äôt just that they didn‚Äôt make any formal request to change the VAR, the reporting makes it sound like they didn‚Äôt even bring it up to anyone, as they claimed they had in their statement. \n\nI assume either a report revealing that they did indeed warn the PGMOL will come out or they‚Äôll fully retract everything.\n\nBut didn‚Äôt they say so in their official statement?\n\nNo, they didn't.\n\nHe did ref clashes involving top 4 last year though. This feels like a change in policy. I vaguely recall Webb announcing that, might be a fever dream or some shit.\n\nThere are NO clear standards for what a penalty/handball is in football - ALL of the penalty situations yesterday have resulted in penalties during this season. Hell, Coventry got a pan for EXACTLY the same as Ashley Young did.... These \"refs\" have no fucking clue what an \"unnatural position of arms\" is because they have never played the game!\n\nAnd this VAR nonsense is just an easier way of fixing matches - those mic's should be open for ALL to listen in on. In the stadiums and at home and refs should have to answer for their \"decisions\" in pressers after each match.\n\nI actually don‚Äôt think the alleged handball was a pen, however I could see how someone disagrees. That third no call was egregious, though. That‚Äôs a penalty every day of the week. \n\nPersonally, think it‚Äôs a case of a couple things being true. \n\nA) Atwell is a Luton supporter \n\nB) he jobbed NFFC, likely to benefit to Luton \n\nC) NFFC didn‚Äôt follow through on reporting that Atwell is a Luton supporter, which there is a process for and the premier league has evidently been responsive to in the past\n\nD) There was miscommunication internally at NFFC that led to the people in charge of the reporting not communicating the lack of the report to the people who wrote the response post match\n\nE) NFFC embarrassed themselves a bit\n\nI agree with your list - not kosher....\n\nBut Coventry got a pen for the exact same \"handball\" after VAR, and I have seen pens given for both the other situations. The trouble is, it's those same poor refs who sit in the VAR cave and have no clue about how the game runs.\n\nIf one still supports VAR, despite the evident chaos it has brought to the game, it's as if they've willingly immersed themselves in layers of confusion and misunderstanding. It's a perplexing stance to take, revelling in the ruination of football to satisfy an over-focused VAR tendency.\n\nBringing up the coventry penalty makes zero sense whatsoever, because the situation is the opposite. The on field decision was penalty. \nThere is always a range when it comes to fouls/handballs.\n\nDefinite pen | Could be given  |  Denfinitely no pen. \n\nThe VAR has to decide where in the range the situation falls. If it is in either of the ‚Äûdefinite‚Äú ranges he has to inform the ref. If it‚Äòs in the middle, the on field decision has to stand, whatever it is. That means that the same situation can be a pen in one game and no pen in another, depending on what the red decides on the field. I have not seen the Young handball, so I won‚Äòt comment on it, but the Coventry pen is completely irrelevant to the situation.\n\nWhat a crock of shit..... It's the EXACT same situation!\n\nRemember when all you proponents of VAR told us, with absolute certainty, that it would sort out all the controversy in the game? They lied. Remember all those ‚Äòwhat if‚Ä¶..‚Äô hypothetical situations they made up to justify VAR. That was bullshit.\n\nThen when VAR turned out to be fucking terrible, you same people with a straight face week telling us that VAR is okay, it was the people who operated the system that were at fault. \n\nHonestly, how thick do you have to be to say some shit like this? \n\nOf course it‚Äôs the people‚Äôs fault; we always knew it would be. You just didn‚Äôt listen and you‚Äôre still not listening if you‚Äôre still blaming the humans.\n\nThe irony if Forest go down due to sus VAR calls when that's exactly what got them promoted.\n\nActually, we were only in that playoff game because of a terrible referee decision. \n\nWe had a very good chance of going up automatically; 3 points behind Bournemouth but with better goal difference, playing them away in game 45 when we were on hot form. Sam Surridge is sent clear on goal, brought down, clear penalty and last man. Ref gives offside. It was not even close. Referee actually apologised to Forest afterwards. Didn't get that goal, went on to lose automatic and had to go through the playoffs. \n\nThe ref that day?\n\nStuart Attwell.\n\nShh people love a narrative against Forest. Yet time and time again Forest are proved correct\n\nmakes sense now why he helped city get through, because that way it is more likely to open up a european spot for newcastle in the league if city win the FA cup whereas if Chelsea or United win it, it wouldnt give that spot\n\nI think the suggestion that they‚Äôre capable of this level of forward thinking is the most unrealistic part of this conspiracy\n\njust needs to ask a taxi driver on his way to the game.\n\nfr\n\nWhat absolute waffle.\n\nyh it is a bit, im just saying this cuz of the pen he didnt give to chelsea, this is the only reason i can see why he wouldve helped city\n\nNo, he's just firmly on the City payroll at this point.\n\nHe's all about his cushy gigs in the UAE.\n\nGuy above saying he‚Äôs a United fan. You saying he‚Äôs on city‚Äôs payroll. \n\nClueless\n\nGet your uniteds right god damn!! /s\n\nNewcastle United?\n\nHe probably is. But money comes first for the greedy.\n\nYou been sniffing glue laaa\n\nThis isn't a theory or some conspiracy. This is an admitted and proven fact.\n\nHope you've got your tin foil hat on for protection.\n\nTrash can of a heart\n\nThen Gillett shouldn‚Äôt be doing teams involved in a title race if he‚Äôs a Liverpool fan?\n\nhmmm\n\nNever in doubt of course. Outrageous MSM couldn‚Äôt wait to have a go at Forest.\n\nThe thing is surely if atwell is a Luton fan he would have wanted Forrest to get the penalties as a draw keeps both teams close rather than wanting Everton to win\n\nYeah we really needed that not sure why he'd give it away if he had the choice, still shouldn't be put in that situation.\n\nThe best chance Luton has of staying up is beating out Nottingham Forest, Everton still have Luton/Brentford/Sheffield to play which means they'll probably pick up some more points, not to mention they have a game in hand. It's a pipe dream for Luton to finish above Everton, even if this game was a draw, but beating out NFFC is a legit possibility\n\nAn Everton win was the best result for Luton. If it was a draw then Luton would have been 2pts behind Forest and safety whereas Everton winning (bearing in mind Everton have a game in hand too) leaves Luton only 1pt behind Forest.\n\nnah, it's better for Luton to go H2H with Forrest. Everton have been a better team this season, without the point deductions they would've been 5pts ahead of Forrest with a game in hand before their game on the weekend.\n\nYou.. you can‚Äôt actually spell Forest?\n\nAttwell playing 4D chess lol\n\nOliver the twat shouldn‚Äôt have been allowed to ref United, Brighton, spurs and Liverpool games last season too. He made a lot of bad decisions in games involving those clubs who were competing with Newcastle for top 4.\n\nNah its just stupid that Forest said something like that\n\nTo be proven correct? Forest are spot on for saying something like that. Football should applaud them\n\nare you on drugs?\n\nStick to twitter fella lol\n\nwhat's a twitter¬†\n\nNottingham forest are a load of nerds\n\nWouldn't this anger you though? They've been robbed of so many decisions\n\nThe only club who has benefitted more from VAR is Fulham. They got jobbed in this match but they haven‚Äôt been getting screwed the whole season\n\nThat post is like the sort of thing a crybaby teenage arsenal fan posts about everyone hating them, but it was the actual club. Would be so embarrassed if that was my club\n\nYou fucking wouldn‚Äôt stop lying to yourself.\n\nWe should be supporting clubs calling out shit officiating, not putting them down. This is literally good for everyone\n\nWe did. Then they bought in VAR and people want to get rid of it. People like wrong decisions as long as it goes in their favour.\n\nSomething (var) is not working properly, so instead of fixing it and the current use we do of it, let‚Äôs get rid of it altogether. Such stupid line of thinking\n\nIt's smart if you want to go back to influencing the ref on the pitch to get your way.\n\nExactly, you expect fans to do it but if Arsenal actually did it it'd be disgraceful\n\nHardly, they just complain the most. Ask any fan if they think they've had better treatment than Forest, other than Arsenal, Liverpool, Chelsea and the two Manchester clubs\n\nUh no. They have every right to complain. Michael Oliver and the rest of PGMOL are undermining the integrity of the league.\n\nForest also pay a salary to mark clattenberg to ‚Äúadvise‚Äù them, and then he‚Äôs sitting next to his old mate Howard Webb at the games. That undermines the integrity of refereeing\n\nBut maybe they got him in because they decisions against them were SO bad all season\n\ntotal nonsense. why would anyone give a fuck enough to start a conspiracy against forest? \"oh no, they might finish 16th\"\n\nI don't think it's a conspiracy but they also might finish 18th. I also think they absolutely should have been given the points deduction btw - speaking only about the stuff on the pitch. The fact they've only had one penalty all season says a lot\n\nHow do you not think it's a conspiracy? If you think they've been unfairly treated that implies a conspiracy\n\nyeah it says theyre a bottom of the table team who isnt in the opponents penalty area as much as top teams. tottenham also have one and they attack a lot\n\nWould suggest Tottenham should also have had a lot more penalties tbf - saw a stat going round that Forest have had nearly 800 touches in the box for one pen\n\nAnd guess when those decisions stopped? When Liverpool made a similar statement\n\nMoney? All three title contenders have fairly comfortable games on the last day, so even if it does go down to that day, it is unlikely to be dramatic. Arsenal and Liverpool already dropping points suggests it might get done before the last day.  \n\nIn the absence of a dramatic title run, a relegation battle is the next most popular event. The premier league will certainly be keen to have something on there to ensure advertising revenue is high, not only BARB rating in England, but now for the global product. Aside from a big financial hole this year, it also influences future pricing. \n\nI can certainly imagine refs being conscious that one of their paymasters benefits hugely from keeping the tightest relegation battle possible.\n\nForest and Liverpool are doing that\n\nThey‚Äôre a terrible\nFan base. But they have a right to complain.\n\nNot disagreeing that they can complain, but think they could have done it behind closed doors rather than blowing it up and publicly accusing an official of match fixing."

Neymar made 137 milion last year injured came back for 29 minutes and got injured again for 5 to 7 weeks\n\nNo way he‚Äôll be the only guy. Having worked over there can confirm that Saudis are notorious for refusing to pay for work done\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/athletic/4866378/2023/09/20/saudi-pro-league-clubs-ordered-to-pay-16m-to-aggrieved-players-in-last-year/\n\nPay walled ‚Äî that sucks.\n\nIf you want to avoid the paywall just put an extra dot after the .com\n\nHero\n\nWow\n\nThere is no pay wall in Saudi...\n\nhttps://www.sportbible.com/football/saudi-arabia-cristiano-ronaldo-wages-pif-504013-20230612\n\nThanks buddy\n\nlol a certain irony there.\n\nJournalism costs money.\n\nas ads are shoved in your face\n\nHe will get nothing out of that severance package lol. That's the issue when doing business with the Saudi elite. Many companies and individuals that went there for business can sing a song about it. And footballers already complained last year about issues even when we talk about payment in general.\n\nImagine having an English manager and the players can't understand his accent\n\nIf I‚Äôd cost a powerful Saudi that amount of money, I‚Äôd be worried about a totally different kind of severance.\n\nImagine thinking anyone goes there to be good and not to collect 15m a year while doing no work\n\nIf I‚Äôm an Englishman, I won‚Äôt even imagine living in SA.\n\nI‚Äôm English but not a millionaire, I‚Äôd pull my cheeks apart and let them fuck me for that kinda money\n\nJust make sure you get the bag before they clap them cheeks¬†\n\nall you had to do was manage the team bro..\n\nThat would require years though, my tight virgin hole they wouldn‚Äôt last a minute and I‚Äôd be on my way with millions.\n\nHe's not living there, he's living in UAE (I think?) and commuting for a few hours every morning lol\n\nBahrain, it's roughly 1hr commute to Dammam. But you have to cross the border, can be slightly annoying but not that bad - I guess there may be some \"fast track\" for him though.¬†\n\nHe isn't. There were rumours Gerrard is commuting from more-liberal Bahrain.\n\nHe lives in Bahrain\n\nIt‚Äôs so fucking hot over there they say the wind feels like holding a hair dryer up to your face lol\n\nThat‚Äôs ok, they‚Äôre coming to live with you. Folkestone and Dover\n\nPeople from Saudi Arabia are moving to England? Other than billionaires, I don‚Äôt think they are mate\n\nAnd billionaires are not moving to Folkestone or Dover. The person you replied to has certified donkey brains.\n\nAs if England is better lol piss off\n\nIm not English but I doubt that they take the players passports as soon as they land. Or, you know, the whole slavery and human rights thing\n\nThe UK is literally built off monarchy\n\nDifference is our monarchy told their monarchy they would become a monarchy when they were just tribes on camels and then they drew the borders and told the tribe of Saud that Arabia would become their kingdom. There‚Äôs levels to it.. there‚Äôs monarchies.. then there‚Äôs THE monarchy. Also the difference is our monarchy actually gave us some freedom out of fear, Saudi is literally a monarchy system.\n\nAnd that is relevant why? Most western countries were a monarchy at some point, so technically, they all were built of monarchies. I dont agree with monarchies, but its not my country.  \nBut im glad you pointed that out instead of the slavery and human rights part, i see you truly are a human that cares lol.  \nI can see from your comments history that you are a nice guy, specially when only 4/13 comments are still up (counting this one ‚òùÔ∏è).   \n\nTell me again, is it the english or the saudis that made mass executions? Or cut off limbs for theft charges? Or lashings and floggings? Or use torture?    \n\nI would tell you to suck a dick, but i dont want you to be executed\n\n\"Built off\" and \"currently under control of\" are two very different things. UK isn't under an absolute monarchy and hasn't been for hundreds of years\n\nGo ahead and survey any number of random people and see how many of them would prefer Saudi Arabia to England lol\n\nEverywhere is better than Saudi Arabia\n\nI guess it depends on who you are. If you‚Äôre gay, you‚Äôre way better off in a place like the USA than in Saudi Arabia. But if you‚Äôre a black man, you might actually have a lower chance of getting shot dead during a ‚Äòrandom‚Äô traffic stop in Saudi Arabia.\n\nYou‚Äôre kidding right? People really have no idea how racist many Arabs are against Asians, black people and Jews\n\nTbh I think the black guys got better odds in Saudi vs the Deep South lol ü§£\n\nWhat about just living a generally peaceful life without a worry that you might break some interpretation of an Islamic law and be beheaded for it?\n\nOf course it is you gimp. And if it wasn't for the money nobody would be interested in Saudi.\n\nEngland is definitely not a place I wanna be at but it easily beats Saudi Arabia lmao\n\nSoon, the UK will be the new Saudi.\n\nBruv\n\nSeek some education ü§°üòÇ\n\nIt‚Äôs like failing upwards\n\nI would be totally fine if that was my reality.\n\nTo be honest I get the vibe that Gerrard just doesn‚Äôt care and he‚Äôs just taking as much money as he can get. Did you see the article about him saying he schedules training around Liverpool matches? I like that as a Liverpool fan but if hardly screams successful manager\n\nGerrard was saying that tongue in cheek. I'm not quite sure how you never picked up on that.\n\nMostly because he says things like that and is proven to be a much better manager than the level he is actually performing at.\n\nHe loves Liverpool but he's also a professional. It was quite clearly a joke that flew over your head.\n\nProven? Great spell at Rangers but I'm not sure his time at Villa proved anything.\n\nHe lost 2 out of 3 league titles. And only won one when an even more incompetent manager than himself was appointed at Celtic in Neil Lennon. \n\nEven Lennon beat him in his first season. He's an awful manager.\n\nGerrard's time at Rangers was mixed. He had to pick up the club from a very low point, and from that perspective, he did very well. He also had Rangers punching well above its weight in Europe, and it was his team that van Bronckhorst then took to the final. He obviously also had that fantastic unbeaten league season. His record against Celtic was very good too, especially by the end. He had their number. Rangers under him were incredibly fit, and could play some fantastic football.\n\nHowever, he also only won one single trophy. He regularly struggled against the likes of Aberdeen and Kilmarnock. His record in the domestic cups was awful. He oversaw complete collapses in form in the first two seasons, and he was on the brink of getting sacked in March 2020 before the pandemic. Even at the end, Rangers drew 3 home games and lost away to Dundee United before he left. Celtic ended up winning the league by 4 points.\n\nGerrard is a decent manager but a very flawed one. He'd probably do well at a lower level PL club.\n\nHe took over a lower level PL club, was  absolute shite and they immediately and dramatically improved the second he left.\n\nI'll clarify - a smaller PL club. Villa are a bigger club who should have bigger aspirations.\n\nThey got rid of Gerrard and realised those aspirations\n\nI think people underestimate how hard it is to run a \"smaller PL club\". \n\nIn those clubs you can't pay your way out of trouble; in the first season you have to make lemonade with the lemons you are given, and even from there you can only buy players that are simply not that good (or they'd be at the big clubs). \n\nGetting results on low budgets is really hard. Yes, smaller clubs might require a slightly different skillset than top clubs, but it doesn't mean it's easier.\n\nI think it‚Äôs more that my comment flew over yours to be honest with you mate. Clearly talking about a few things he‚Äôs said and he‚Äôs general behaviour but that requires the tiniest bit of thought. He was good at Rangers and certainly sustained it long enough to show he was somewhat good. He was good in his first job at our u21s too. It wasn‚Äôt until Villa that he started slipping a bit and as I said, I think everything points towards Saudi Arabia being a paycheque he doesn‚Äôt really care about.\n\nThere‚Äôs also the fact someone else raised being the cheque and nothing more being the sole reason ANY western footballers or managers have gone there in the first place.\n\nHe 'slipped' long before Villa\n\nWalked right into that one I guess mate aha, take the upvote and do one lol\n\nI think it flew over a lot of people's heads because you tried to use his tongue in cheek comment as your proof.\n\nThanks anyway though. Really informative nonsense.\n\nWell I doubt a lot have read my comment either but it makes more sense when you stop to think before commenting in both this situation and in general.\n\nI do think the onus on bringing new information was down to yourself considering you jumped in with an ALCHULY, but I‚Äôll let you think you did something big and clever init.\n\nYeah, that's it. Everyone else is the problem. \nAbsolutely nothing to do with the fact that you couldn't identify basic sarcasm.\n\nOh no sorry you‚Äôre mistaken, only yourself is the issue here. Don‚Äôt really think I‚Äôve implied otherwise. But despite me further explaining the point you don‚Äôt seem to get off the first mistake so hardly a surprise.\n\n&gt;much better manager than the level he is actually performing at.\n\n[Citation needed]\n\nHes fucking wank as a manager. My highschool PE teacher could win a scottish league title with rangers or celtic\n\nNobody's gone to Saudi for any other reason.\n\nI would like to be a laughing stock with 10 million in my bank.\n\nFully agree - he had nothing to lose really. Had done a bad job at Villa so wouldn‚Äôt have walked into a new job\n\nGerrard has a lot more than that in the bank.\n\nI'm sure Gerrard is the one laughing the hardest as he checks his bank balance every day. No one cares about Saudi league.\n\n[deleted]\n\nIt's kinda odd though, because you're criticising everyone that is bringing up how Gerrard is getting a shit ton of money for this, but also saying how not everythings about money, whilst not criticising Gerrard for being in Saudi.  If it was truly about the love of the game, why not go manage in a country where football means way more to everyone? \n\nit's a bit more convoluted imo, I love Gerrard but his tenure at Villa seems to have scared him away a bit. He has functionality retired by going to Saudi\n\nIf he wanted to succeed as a manger he wouldn't have gone to Saudi league he would've stayed in Europe, he cares for money and that's why he doesn't care if he succeeds or not, people were the same in the 80s you were just too dumb to see it.\n\nCouldn‚Äôt have said it better *slow clap* \nGlad there are still people who think this way mate.\n\nP.S: I‚Äôm a Liverpool season ticket holder, If money was the prime motivator for Gerard, he would have left us for Real Madrid or Bayern in his playing days, because both wanted to buy him\n\nHe‚Äôs a multimillionaire. Who gives a FUCK whether he plays well or not in a shit league? He certainly doesn‚Äôt.\n\n[deleted]\n\nImagine thinking you know Gerrard's motives more than any other random dork on the internet and then doing exactly the same thing you're judging everyone else for--presenting said opinion as though it were fact. Gerard didn't take a job in Saudi because of the love of the sport, he very likely specifically chose Saudi for the massive payday, just like the players who have gone there.\n\nI can assure you hundreds of millions of dollars in the bank would bring happiness\n\nI just watched his talk with carragher in overlap or whatever they are doing now Keane neville carragher and Wright overlap on tour or something and carragher video called him from center of pitch in Istanbul.\n\nIf Gerard joked about money like that working in Europe, fans would have his head in 24 hours....\n\nFor sure, because European football is not a joke.\n\nWe don't behead people in Europe.\n\nWe do.... it punishable by law but we do\n\nThat was a bit sinister mate\n\nWell he made carpet statement about Europeans not doing it and I said some of us do. I'm not gonna search examples of it in recent time Europe, but I'm sure at some stage recently someone somewhere in Europe did it\n\nI get you, it‚Äôs just funny because it read a bit like you are taking offence that someone hasn‚Äôt recognised your propensity for being able to behead people.\n\nDon't forget stoning, they love a bit of that over there.\n\nGot no time for that being hounded all day on reddit for sharing something someone else wrote... also didn't like his carpet blaming entire country as equally bad\n\nYou‚Äôre really into carpets.\n\nI'm a carpenter\n\n[deleted]\n\nSomehow I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs Gerrards fault with the shortfall off good English managers üòÇ\n\nten years back by going to Saudi? wot\n\nenglish managers have shit easy, i don't think there's any issue there.\n\nHe‚Äôs always had money, now he just has more. Whereas he is now a laughing stock, it has to bother him personally\n\nHe sacrificed any chance of coaching relevance when he went there. Now it‚Äôs gone poorly and he‚Äôs a laughing stock.\n\nHe knew all this when he signed that massive contract. My favourite player growing up but hard to see this as anything other than a mercenary coming to the end, and he won‚Äôt care cause he‚Äôs already paid\n\nHe is such a mid coach, not even close to the level of other coaches there\n\nAnd yet the whole world laughs at the Saudi League for paying him all that money. Laugh all the way to the bank Gerrard!\n\nGerrard: \"If Al-Ettifaq loses, and no one is around to see it, did it really happen?\"\n\nWell alliti fuck....he might be on to something there\n\nhe's lucky still to be in a job despite the mediocre results.\n\nDid you mean to put a '?' at the end there? Your question makes no sense to me\n\nmy bad, shd be a full stop\n\n?\n\nYou sound like my line manager\n\nHe has always been a shit manager let's be honest. Doesn't really have the personality or brains for it\n\n[deleted]\n\nBased on watching him try to manage football teams over the last six years or so\n\n[deleted]\n\nAnd also underperforming in Saudi\n\nHe was a lot worse than below average at Villa. We were 17th when he got sacked and Emery turned us into a top 4 team with pretty much the same squad\n\nCeltic were rubbish the season he won the league. The rest of the league finish below the Old Firm, it's not the achievement people think it is.\n\nI don't rate Gerrard as a manager, but going undefeated, and only conceding 13 goals is definitely a bloody achievement. Give your head a wobble if you think otherwise. \n\nHe's a centurion as well.\n\nHe went unbeaten. Even if Celtic won all their games v Rangers they would have finished 2nd. Also scored 102 and conceded 13. Say what you want about what he‚Äôs done since but come on, can‚Äôt really have a go at what he achieved in Scotland at all.\n\nIt's a rare feat to go unbeaten but it's still not a magic achievement. The old firm games are the toughest and if the other team is doing badly that's your title decider games. Seems to be a theme of falling off after winning 9 titles in a row in Scotland as well, neither of them have been able to keep it up to hit 10.\n\nYou got served there tho ü§£ü§£ü§£. Unlucky pal\n\nYes you can, if it wasn't for the Covid season with no fans he wouldn't have won Jack shit. He's a fucking haddy who's getting found out.\n\nHe was a lot worse than below average at Villa.\n\nThis isn‚Äôt /r/soccer. Back up your generalization with some details. This subreddit is for discussions about the sport.\n\nüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ. Ok here goes... He was at Rangers for nearly four years and won one trophy. That's one trophy out of twelve. His job was saved by COVID as,before that, the fans wanted him out. The one trophy he did win was during the lockdown season with no fans in the stadium and Celtic were racked with infighting. He went to Aston Villa where he lasted less than a year and the fans couldn't wait to see the back of him. He has been at Al Ittifaq for just over a year and they are talking about getting rid of him already. Is that enough 'details' for you?\n\nCan you explain though where you saw him as a failure as a manager based on his training, tactics and player development?\n\nThere‚Äôs always opportunities for someone to get better and even amazing managers have failed before. \n\nYou‚Äôre going by fan opinion. So since this is a forum for more objective discussion, please give details.\n\nYou're on reddit bro, no one is here to write a thesis, and you're definitely not getting any \"objective discussion\". It's social media afterall.\n\nIs that you beale?\n\nShould‚Äôve never left Rangers, safe bet for an average manager like him.\n\nHe‚Äôs always been a laughing stock.  One trophy out of 11, before he bailed. Even St. Johnstone won more than he did during his stint.\n\nHe obviously wasn‚Äôt a laughing stock during the period at Rangers and that‚Äôs why he got the Villa job. \n\nYou can think he‚Äôs crap and acknowledge he did have a period of good results.\n\nHe won ONE trophy in 3 seasons. In Scotland. That‚Äôs laughable, with the resources he had. Guy‚Äôs a chancer.\n\nRight yeah. How many leagues have they won since he left with all those resources? It‚Äôs a cake walk right, so I assume 3?\n\nWhen you display such a lack of nuance in your opinion it doesn‚Äôt reflect on the subject, it reflects on you. üëçüèº\n\nRight on, Einstein üëäüèª\n\nAh that‚Äôs nice of you. Thanks man ‚ò∫Ô∏è\n\nHe was mates with Chris purslow who also got sacked with Gerrard, he didn't get it on merit he got it though the old pals act they was at Liverpool together purslow loves him, do go on YouTube and have a look at his behaviour, stripped mings of the armband for nothing, bombs the squad telling everyone they are shit, says in a press conference Chelsea should walk all over villa goes back to Liverpool after training, he was a toxic cunt and he was a good player but no from day one he mugged it stealing a living\n\nHis stock was high at the time. He had won the league with Rangers and performed well in Europe.  You can splurge as many words as you want but there was scores of positive coverage of him and the move at the time regardless of what you want to tell yourself. \n\nI know it didn‚Äôt go well at Villa, I don‚Äôt think anyone disputes that.\n\nAnyone who goes over there is a laughing stock for being a greedy unethical shite. Nobody is actually watching or caring how well they are doing.\n\n[deleted]\n\nSpotted the Saudi\n\nHe‚Äôs laughing all the way to the bank, fair play to him\n\nHas he slipped up?\n\nOriginal.\n\nWhy thank you\n\nWhat this shit for brains actually knows about football you could write on a post it note.\n\nPashun. Be at it.\n\nDoes he not have enough money or why he let people make fun of him?\n\nWho would've guessed a player not know for his tactical ability would not be a good tactician for 11 other players on the pitch.\n\nLeave the football before the football leaves you.\n\nLaughing all the way to the Bank\n\nThings we do for money\n\nI remember a video from a training session right after when he got hired where he literally was trying to teach his players how to play football.\n\nWas he THIS bad at Villa? \nDoes he have a strong team to begin with or are his tactics the main issue?\nI don't watch Saudi tbh\n\nSlipping\n\nHas he slipped up?\n\nHe was supposed to be the successor of Klopp.\n\nShockingly bad manager\n\nHis managerial career is over. No premier league club will look at him after his epic failure at city and then Saudi. His only bet now is if he‚Äôs willing to take a job in the championship and somehow rebuild his rep but Gerrard strikes me as someone with a huge ego and wouldn‚Äôt be willing to drop down.\n\nUseless manager, useless \"token\" appointment, useless results.\n\nHe made so much money and the Saudis are paying him, i don't think they understand the joke is on them\n\nThey pay him a fortune so it is fun y they don't realiser that the joke is on them tbh\n\nSaudi league is a laughing stock, so all par for the course. Gerrard is also laughing all the way to the bank\n\nIt just proves it doesn't matter how good a player you were, you either have it or you don't when it comes to being a good coach.\n\nLampard was another great player who was a pretty poor coach.\n\nXabi Alonso was a great player and seems to be a great coach even though it's still early. I guess maybe him being Spanish explains why?\n\nPlot twist: being an elite player doesn‚Äôt make you a good coach.¬†\n\nThis is proof that just because you're a good footballer doesn't mean you're gonna be a good manager\n\nSold his soul to the Arabs.\n\nat least he is consistent at being considered a laughing stock\n\nWell, he is a trash manager and this has been proven‚Ä¶\n\nGreat. Fuck him, the morally bankrupt dipshit.\n\nImagine being the laughing stock in a country where the men wears dresses and have slaves.\n\nThe whole Saudi sportswash league is a laughing stock, who cares?\n\nSounds like he's really slipped up over there\n\nAlways has been a laughing stock. The slip vs Chelsea and the fact he never won the league."

    "all_comment_text": "Thanos CF\n\nLol cause they have all the gems? Or why?\n\neurope is so cooked for the next 5 years lol, prepare for 5 ucls in a row\n\nSo true. The firepower they have is just amazing and Carlo can seemingly make anything work.\n\nWait til they get Xabi Alonso lol\n\nI keep seeing this and I don‚Äôt get it. I loved the guy as a player but after one season why are people putting him on a pedestal. I get it was an amazing season but let‚Äôs see him do it again and then we can talk. \n\nWhy get so hyped about Xabi when we got Carlo - Mr. 5 champions leagues.\n\nI mean he doesn‚Äôt need another invincible season to prove that he‚Äôs a great manager. That parts proven already.\n\nHe is undoubtedly a great manager, but that doesn‚Äôt necessarily make him a great manager for Real Madrid.\n\nYeah cuz one good undefeated season in the Bundesliga makes one a great manager. He didn‚Äôt even with Europa. Flukes happen. I call him a manager who had one fantastic season.\n\nCan you explain what was a fluke? A full season unbeaten and going almost all the way in 3 competitions is no small feat. Sure he had one fantastic season but definitely no fluke.\n\nGreatness requires consistency. It has yet to be seen just how high and how long Xabi will go.\n\nLook at the players Carlo gets. It's not that surprising he wins. Xabi, on the other hand, has a lot less to work with, and he became champion. That is why he is so good. I'm not saying Carlo is bad, but he has much better players to work with.\n\nYeah he became a champion in the Bundesliga when the team that is usually the best had a shit season.\n\nI think Bayern only scored more points than Leverkusen once under Guardiola. It is not because of Bayerns average season that Xabi won the trophy. They played an exceptional season and deserve all the credit.\n\n7, he won 2 as a player\n\nI‚Äôm aware. Im only counting the ones he won as a coach.\n\n5 UCLs in a row would probably be the unquestionable greatest feat ever achieved in any (team) sport, but I doubt it'll happen. even the threepeat was something we'll probably not see any team achieve in our lifetimes, it's that insane.\n\nReal Madrid won the first five ever European Cups, 1955-1960. So they‚Äôve done it before, technically. Appreciate the challenge is much greater now than it was then.\n\nWeren‚Äôt those under Franco‚Äôs rule though? Surely they don‚Äôt count\n\nYes, it was under a fascist government , in Europe, running away from fascism and don't wanting fascism to achieve any good result in sports\n\nThey still.were able to win 5 in a row\n\nhaha you think Franco controlled a continental club competition? The bussbac vid Real Madrid released a year ago proved otherwise.\n\nIf that mattered, then the real Franco team, Atl√©tico Aviaci√≥n(Now Atl√©tico Madrid), would have won. Well at least they are still a bunch of fascist ultras.\n\nBold claim. Don't forget the New Zealand All Blacks exist. They have madrid mentality and throw up their numbers if not better¬†\n\nNot really? They're not even the country with most World Cups at the moment. Won 2 in a row *once*.\n\nIt‚Äôs ok to say you don‚Äôt follow rugby, the All Blacks are probably the most successful sporting team in history. They‚Äôve won 77% of the games in their history (since 1903) and 86% in the last 20 years alone which has only dipped below 90 in the last 2 years  yeah they ‚Äúonly‚Äù managed two WC in a row. There have only been 10 rugby world cups, they‚Äôve won 3, came second twice and 3rd three times\n\nSA has won 4.\n\nYes. With a 62% historic win rate (540 games) vs ABs 77% (637 games). All Blacks have maintained a far better record over a longer period of time\n\nDoesn't matter if you don't win the big games. Why are you talking about UCLs won for Real Madrid instead of win percentage? Because even though it's relatively few games, those are the ones that matter most.\n\nIt‚Äôs still rugby. Played seriously by like 8 nations.\nThis is football. Played by fucking everyone. (Number of countries where it isn‚Äôt the sport #1 is very small‚Ä¶ the US, Lithuania, and a handfull of others‚Ä¶. Football is BY FAR the most popular sport in global terms)\n\nIf you want to compare New Zealand in rugby, you could so mediterranean countries in waterpolo. Or France in handball, how dominant they‚Äôve been with Karabatic.\n\nBut no, it‚Äôs be silly.\n\nI don't think any team in rugby or any sport will dominate as much as new zealand did between 2011-15. World cups be damned, no team is better than them.\n\nSpain 2008-12?\n\nhow is it a bold claim if ur talking about rugger\n\n\nThe odds of Real Madrid winning champions league are 4 to 1. If you're confident in their victory, go ahead and quadruple your money.\n\nits a joke\n\nLoool Mbappe will ruin their mood\n\nI hope so.\n\nfarmers continent\n\nXabi Alonso at Real Madrid will be the gamechanger imo\n\nTell me something new\n\nDisagree. I‚Äôll say 2, but they‚Äôll bottle defending a lot. With their targets of TAA and Davies, it‚Äôs gonna be Rudiger and Militao (name 2 CB‚Äôs) vs the world\n\nConcede 3 goals, score 7 lol\n\nMendy still here. \nTchoameni has been great DM. \n\nValverde and Bellingham are quite successful at defending and recovery also. \n\n\nThey have tools to balance things out\n\nLegit, line 2 I pointed out the wing backs linked with real-Mendy wouldn‚Äôt start over Davies\n\nAnd either way, 3v (I‚Äôll go 6 on attack, on average)\n\nNah it‚Äôs because they‚Äôre purple aliens\n\nGal√°cticos 2.0\n\nNot really, very different strategy. Most of these players haven't even reach their peak. Floren learnt from the mistakes of that era.¬†\n\nYeah and atleast this time he won't sell the \"Makelele\" of the team and ruin the squads chemistry\n\nThe champions league is going to end up being a farmers league at this rate\n\nneed a ucl? join madrid.\n\nUnless you‚Äôre Harry Kane\n\nThe only one that can stop Real at this point\n\nJoining Real to win the Champions League is the equivalent of losing your virginity to a prostitute.\n\nThe other guys are going to prostitutes as well, but they‚Äôre only getting handjobs. Not Real Madrid‚Äôs fault.\n\nExactly\n\n10th time i see this joke today\n\nat this point it already is\n\nsomeone drop the picture of that dude looking at a tornado saying ‚ÄúHERE IT COMES‚Äù\n\nThe era of super teams begun 12-13 years ago, snd sinve then only 4-5 teams have had a realistic chance at winning UCL.\n\n\nThis is due to two reasons,\n\n\n1. Financial power of certain clubs, and their ability to circumvent rules\n\n\n2. Lack of great players to go around for all top teams\n\nI also think it‚Äôs FFP as well, yes it stops big teams from overspending but it also stops the smaller teams from growing as you can‚Äôt spend more than your revenue. Which the traditional big teams will always have more of, so no one can catch up\n\nI think that going from being The Biggest Thing In Paris to being Jude Bellingham's sidekick is going to be great for Mbappe. Man needs to spend some time as a member of a team rather than the star.\n\nHe's going to have to earn respect at Real Madrid. He's going to have to work to do that. We'll really get to see what he is all about.\n\n[removed]\n\nYeah, Vini is such a global superstar for Brazil, right?\n\n\nMbappe is the star of that team now, this is akin to Zidane signing in 01, and dwarfing everyone else on the team.\n\nTend to agree\n\nAlso Vini's sidekick.\n\nBut it's the fact that he'll be expected to keep his mouth shut and generate assist numbers for a player five years younger than him that will be a test of his humility.\n\nAnd like I say, I think it'll be good for him, if he learns to put in work like the rest of that Real Madrid team does then he's going to find a whole new level.\n\nI don‚Äôt think he will be expected to provide assists for vini. Mbappe scores more than anyone else bar Harry Kane and Haaland. Vini has had a better season but mbappe is a more complete player. He might not instantly be the main man but it‚Äôs naive to think he won‚Äôt be the focal point of their attack.\n\n\"generate assist numbers FOR\" - I think he's saying he is to raise Vini's assist numbers by scoring goals himself.\n\nPretty sure they're talking about Jude, seeing as they're talking about a player 5 years younger than Mbapp√© being the one he needs to get used to providing assists to. \n\nWhich, ya know, is still wrong - probably more so than the idea of Mbapp√© providing assists for Vini - but I think that was their intent. \n\nYou're bang on, though. While Mbapp√© will certainly still provide assists he is absolutely being brought in to be their main man and put the ball in the back of the net. Jude's role will likely shift a bit (as it has done over the course of this season anyway) towards less of a focus on goalscoring opportunities to give Mbapp√© the space he'll need to run into.\n\nMbappe is washed.\n\nThese takes are absolutely horrendous. Mbappe is gonna be the star player with all the goals.\n\nMbappe's name value far outclasses the Brazilians and Bellingham. It's not even remotely close.\n\nThat‚Äôs not going to help him get him into good books of Carlo or fans..lol\n\nThose people don't have the slightest clue. My eyes hurt reading that bullshit :D.\n\nAs the Zen Master said, we'll see.\n\nWhy do we assume he can't do that? Mbappe's always come across as professional to me, the guy single-handedly carried PSG for years and stood against the entire Argentinian team in the World Cup Final by himself. PSG's President waged a war of egos against Perez and lost it all.\n\n&gt; Why do we assume he can't do that?\n\njealousy and a childish wish that it will happen despite knowing it won't. these people know that Madrid will dominate even harder with Mbappe, so they make up their toxic little stories so they can feel what they think is happiness at least temporarily.\n\nLol, Mbappe is a global superstar, the Real Madrid forwards have absomutely nothing on him when it comes to name brand and pressure to deliver.\n\nlol what ‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt think you guys know who Mbapp√© actually is ‚Ä¶\n\nNo, I don't. Some lad from a meme league. Let's see what he can do in a proper club.\n\nIt‚Äôs not like he is literally the best UCL scorer alongside Kane this season. It‚Äôs not like he won a World Cup at the age of 19 scoring and being the MOTM against Argentina and also scoring in the final from outside the box. It‚Äôs not like on his second World Cup run he literally went to the final and scored an hattrick in said final, also winning golden boot. \nIt‚Äôs not like all the French players that are in Madrid literally come from the same ¬´¬†meme¬†¬ª league and are now rolling the liga as if it was a cake play. \n\nYeah sure buddy.\n\nYou guys are so delusional\n\nThrow his toys out the pram, force one of Vini Rodrygo or Bellingham out, not get the respect he ‚Äúdeserves‚Äù, sold in 2 years for Haaland to come in\n\nHaaland in Madrid would be something¬†\n\nIt‚Äôs one of those galactico signings, might never happen but every season will be linked. Wait until contract expires\n\nNot really, mbappe is not some random dude. He's arguably the best player in the world since a couple of years.\n\nMbappe went on to become the main character for PSG when Neymar and Messi joined the club.¬†\n\nHe is already the new face of Real Madrid from now on. But still pressure will be on him. I don‚Äôt think there ever was a transfer as anticipated as this one. And the whole world expects magic from his first match.\n\nwhy in football players dont ruin their reputation for joining super teams because they couldnt win with other clubs but in basketball its completely frouned upon and their reputation and legacy is ruined. Kevin durants image and reputation was completely tarnished and they dont view the 2 rings as real wins after joining the warriors. In football it doesnt matter.\n\nI think because football teams have many more team members so winning is still not guaranteed unlike basketball where one truly great superstar guarantees the team some success.\n\nI mean, for a lot of players it does wreck their reputation to a point. Depends too on how they leave. Transfers can be a messy business.\n\nHe's a huge waste of money, they don't need him. \nHe will be the highest paid and get a huge signing bonus.\n\nHe‚Äôs coming for free. They don‚Äôt need him but if you have the chance to get Mbappe for free, it‚Äôs a no brainer\n\nYou don't know what a signing bonus is? He could get close to his market value as a signing bonus or as bonus on top of his wage.\n\n\"Free\"  they arnt paying PSG anything but he isnt free. \n\nThe signing on bonus will be more than most players are worth.\n\nI hear you but he‚Äôs worth that money since he‚Äôs one of the best players in the world.\n\nUnnecessary, but its all up to Papa Perez right\n\nGonna be so funny when the eventual PK taker argument starts on the pitch. Let‚Äôs see if Kylian can leave the ego at the door\n\nVini and rodrygo should not be taking any penalties because they both suck at it....\n\nVini scored all the penalties he took in official games\n\nI've found it nerve wracking when Vini takes a penalty compared to guys like Benz and CR7 where I was confident they'll make it 95 times out of a 100. Benz and CR7 would always hit a corner (assuming they don't go middle) whereas Vini's penalties so far have been somewhat midway of the corner. Don't get me wrong Vini has been great and deserves the Bd'or this season but I'm just sharing my observations that his penalty kicks haven't been convincing compared to our previous penalty takers\n\nMan Benz was such a killer striker. Ball at his feet and you'd think. Yeah that's gonna end up in the net. Such a step up after Ronaldo and Bale left. He was so confidence inspiring, I miss having a player like that at RM that would just hit the back of the net given half an opportunity.\n\nAnd mbap should?\n\nYes ‚Ä¶ A guy that can convert 2 pens while being behind in a World Cup final against the best pk stopper. Should indeed.\n\nMartinez best pen stopper? He‚Äôs good at getting in peoples heads, but apart from that he‚Äôs above average GK-since the rule that stopped distractions I‚Äôd wager he‚Äôs not as great\n\nI mean he should be the official penalty kicker no?\n\nI think he should, just saying as I‚Äôm sure once it eventually happens, the media will lose their shits and maybe the locker room morale might be a tad bit fractured but who knows\n\nKylian is a better pk taker. No offense to rodrygo and vini.\n\nShame not to see him getting the chance to be on the end of a Kroos through ball\n\nHe‚Äôll still get to play with Modric‚Äôs balls for a season though. wait‚Ä¶\n\nAye, last ten mins per game\n\nGetting stronger and stronger\n\nScenes when it turns out he actually signed for..... GIRONA.\n\n[deleted]\n\nGood guy Luis Enrique has prepared him this season by subbing him off early multiple times and leaving him on the bench sometimes\n\nCan‚Äôt see how he fits in at Madrid, they‚Äôve won 2 UCLs post Ronaldo, Vini seems to be playing very well, playing Mbappe as a CF is just a waste of his abilities.\n\nliterally played half the games this year as CF/ST and had one of his best individual seasons.\n\nPapa Perez is doing what he always does. Buy all stars. Some of them die on the bench. Meh.\n\nSure I am biased but that's a BS take on Madrid\n\nHazard, Kaka, Illiaramendy all died horrible deaths on the bench. You win some, you lose some.\n\nPutting Illaramendi on the same sentence as Hazard and Kaka is a stretch. Plus, the latter two were mostly injury and fitness issues\n\nReal Madrid did pay 32mill for him in 2013 so he must've been promising no? Im just saying that not everyone makes it because they're at Madrid. Some seem to enjoy the Spanish food and sun a little too much.\n\nHe was! But not the same star power, a bit more of a bet for the future. Indeed it didn t turn out, similar to Reiner, Odegaard and many other bets. Fully agree that not everyone makes it: probably one of the hardest clubs to make it actually.\n\nWhat? Where do you get that from? With the exception of Mbapp√© now, most of his signings in the last 5-7 years have been players under 21-22 years old, not exactly ‚Äústars‚Äù by any stretch of imagination. Real Madrid‚Äôs net spend on signings has been well below that of the other top European clubs in the last decade.\n\nMadrid did have a signing drought but in the last few years they've really set about signing all the best youngsters. Tsuameni, Bellingham, Camavinga. A blind person could've told you that these players are stars. They've also signed Alaba and Rudiger, Courtois, Hazard (funny that) and Vini all in the past 7 years. Sure no goal scoring machines but nothing to scoff at.\n\nWhat‚Äôs stopping other clubs from signing these players? Certainly not lack of funds, in the case of the top Premier League clubs or clubs like PSG. These clubs have spent far more than Real Madrid in the last decade (net spend), but have been far less successful in attracting and developing young, promising players like Vini, Valverde, Camavinga, Rodrygo and, to a lesser extent Bellingham, who was signed when he was 19 and an outstanding young player but not yet the player he has started to become in the past season at Real Madrid .\n\nIt is preposterous to accuse Real Madrid of stuffing its team with ‚Äústars‚Äù or ‚Äúgalacticos‚Äù and thereby gain some unfair advantage over its competitors based solely on financial muscle no other club has. City, Chelsea, Liverpool, PSG and many others are signing more established players and spending more than Real Madrid.\n\nNo one said anything about an unfair advantage. Financial fair play is a pretty big deal atm so only those in tip top shape can afford to blow cash like that. Real Madrid is also more attractive. Obviously all the best players want to play for them. 2 of the teams you mentioned are under investigation for financial fair play for exactly those reasons and Liverpool hasn't signed anyone huge in ages. Real have been an attractive, very likeable club for players because they take good care of them, are financially stable and have a huge history. Their players seem to be able to play forever. The conditioning must be proposterously good so it's unsurprising that young talent gravitates towards them.\n\nLiverpool doesn't have the funds. Klopp is on record saying that he can't operate the team the way MC can. Chelsea is in shambles and PSG is football manager dream team project roleplaying as a club.\n\nNo doubt real Madrid's spending has been excellent. (Buying and selling Morata is the perfect example here) They absolutely deserve to have all the best talent\n\n&gt;No one said anything about an unfair advantage.\n\nWell, the comment we both replied to said ‚ÄúPapa Perez is doing what he always does. Buy all stars.‚Äú which suggests a signing policy based on some financial advantage that allows them to buy pretty much every top-notch player. Plus It‚Äôs not even remotely true that RM have signed nothing but ‚Äústars‚Äù in the last decade, as I explained above.\n\nI sure don't think managing a clubs financials properly is an unfair advantage. If barcas financial planners stop sniffing glue maybe they can get in on the action. It's hunting season baby, and papa Perez is strapped. When you make 1bill in revenue without transfers you can splurge on whatever you want. It's not Perez's fault everyone else is dropping 70mill on Maguire and 800mill on PSG contracts. They've made their bed and now they get to sleep in it.\n\nNow waiting it out and getting Mbappe on a free might very well be the cherry on top.\n\nYou must be new?\n\nHe's gonna be the best striker in the world\n\nHe doesn't fill the striker/center forward role that they really needed, so he's either gonna underperform or compete with Vini and Rodrygo for game time. Regardless, he's an absolute unit and Real are much stronger with him, especially with ending injuries. It might take a year or two but he's probably gonna turn into one of, if not THE star of Real and maybe La Liga as a whole\n\n&gt; He doesn't fill the striker/center forward role that they really needed,\n\n\"Need\" might be a stretch when talking about the current La Liga and UCL winners...\n\nEvery club can improve something. Real \"needs\" a striker far more than it \"needs\" any other position now, especially a winger\n\nWe‚Äôll have to wait and see how he feels with rest of the team. PSG had Messi, Neymar and Mbappe, all at once in their team and still it didn‚Äôt work out. You don‚Äôt fix something that isn‚Äôt broken, they already won the Champions League this year, let‚Äôs see what the introduction of Mbappe does to the team.\n\nBarca had MSN and Madrid had BBC.\n\nIt's just that psg is a upjumped wannabe club so any of the Messi Neymar or Mbappe was way bigger than the club. In the case of RM the club is always bigger.\n\novari da for barca\n\nShades of Henry or Zlatan joining Barca.\n\nSounds OP on paper but I'm not sure it'll work out for the better\n\nAs a Madrid fan, and assuming it's finally happening. I'm really glad it's happening now and not 2 years ago. Now, it's clear to everyone that it's Mbappe who needs Madrid not the others way around. \n\nHe's not Cristiano or Kaka in 2009. \n\nTaking him right after winning Liga and CL, is like: yeah sure we will take you. Rather than oh please join us we are desperate after CR7 and Benzema\n\nWhat ??? Benzema was bad as fuck when he joined real. It took at least 3 years to gain confidence to begin with ‚Ä¶ what are you guys on about?\n\nI didn't say Benzema was good. Ronaldo and Kaka both joined after they won Ballon D'or and Madrid at that time was pretty bad. Madrid was desperate for them to join just like we were desperate after Ronaldo and Benzema left. \n\nMbappe on the other hand is NOT joining when we are in desperate times, joining a few weeks after Liga and CL, he won't be the savior that Ronaldo was\n\nUCL is going to become boring as fuck. I can already see another 3 wins in a row by Real Madrid\n\nRefs already made it boring asf in the past 10 years , so yes will be unwatchable\n\nUCL is never a guarantee no matter how many great players you have.\n\nCan‚Äôt wait to murder man city being that everybody clicks\nWe still need a right back!!!!\n\nthis is getting LUDICROUS\n\nWhat if this is akin to City signing Haaland. I guess it did not stop them from winning the league and their first champions league, so I guess there is not donwside. Never mind.\n\nPapa Perez will tell him be part of the team or piss off to Manchester Blue\n\nKylian Mbappe to me is Messi to his fan base!\n\nnba players joining super teams to win a chip: legacy ruined, reputation tarnished and absolutely hated by media and fans.\n\nfootball players joining super teams after failing to win with other clubs: GOAT, AMAZING!! WOOOAAHH!! I CANT WAIT!! LETS GOOOO!!! GO GET THAT WIN!\n\nNBA is more like joining Bayern, City, PSG to win the local league lol\n\nBecause NBA players do it at the end of their careers and they do it earning the minimum salary.\n\nThis guy is signed as a star and he is going  to earn Madrid top salary.\n\nIn the NBA they call it \"big three\".\n\nNot just Real Madrid (but fuck them anyway)\nReal Madrid winning the UCL (and so many times) and now getting the best player in the world (debatable) cheapens the competition and football in general.\n\nGalaticos era again. What a great achievement all the best players on one team winning the cup? Congratulations.\n\nWho exactly are the other gal√°cticos now? Vini, Valverde and Rodrygo who were signed at 16, 7 years ago? Camavinga? Carvajal? Valverde? R√ºdiger and Alaba? That‚Äôs a lot of coping you‚Äôre doing.\n\nRonaldo\nBale\nModric\nBenzema \nAlonso\nKroos \nMbappe\nBellingham\n\nI could go on and on and on there are so many.\nJust join other great players and win. Wow so good!\n\nImportant to add that it‚Äôs not just RM but they are the epitome of galatico teams\n\nI asked where the so-called galacticos are NOW. Kroos just retired, Modric almost has, Bellingham is not quite at that level yet (and even less so when RM signed him last year) and the others you mention left a couple of years ago or longer (Ronaldo, Bale, Benzema) or have not arrived yet (Mbapp√©).\n\nBro, fucking West Ham has spent more money in the last 10 years than Madrid...\n\nIt's NOTHING like the Gal√°cticos era.\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/7mt56n8pl9oc1.png\n\n45 million a year for 5 years plus royalties....really...\n\nHe is gonna get paid 13m net per season + 100m signing bonus\n\n[He has agreed a deal with Real until 2029, earning 15m euros (¬£12.8m) a season, plus a 150m euro (¬£128m) signing-on bonus to be paid over five years, and he will keep a percentage of his image rights.](https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/czqqg40xv80o)\n\nSo 45 milion a season 5 years plus royalties as I said ..\n\nFabrizio and Cortegana who is reliable for madrid reported different numbers.\n\nSurprise surprise! I'd never have guessed, only club that can afford him,\n\nAre you kidding me? City, and possibly other PL clubs who are drowning in cash could not afford him? That‚Äôs delusional. He‚Äôs going to RM because he wants to play for the best club.\n\nLol, surely half of the pl can afford him¬†\n\nCircus welcoming a clown nice\n\nIts not weird why people still care?\n\nManchester City will need more oil money to match this.\n\nSimply the Best  \nFar superior to Messi\n\nAre you have stupid\n\nThis why Klopp left and why Pepe Guardionalo will left pool red and city man chest hair this and the season of next series respected. They know that they can't compete with the big boys."

I thought he was being Pep-trademark sarcastic saying like \"you enjoy I haven't won in 6 games don't you\"\n\nMaybe I'm just incredibly stupid.\n\nWell if you are incredibly stupid then so am I lol. My first instinct was that he was trying to beat the memers to it.\n\nWe should form a club!\n\nYh you definitely are. Coming out of woodwork to talk about the same team that probably made you say‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not interested in football anymore‚Äù üòÇ\n\nThey've got every other record, now they're going for most consecutive losses. Peps playing 4D chess with us all\n\nSir, with all due respect, he‚Äôs paying tribute to the *six* ULC titles Liverpool have earned over the club‚Äôs history.\nThis is a gentleman and a scholar. Respect.\n\nüíØ\n\nIt is. It's the losing streak lol\n\nBwahahahaha\n\nI thought it was respective league positions.\n\nIf it continues, he will exhaust all his fingers\n\nI thought he was holding up how many billions he's spent.\n\nmaybe how many titles are going to get reallocated after the court case\n\nNone\n\ni guess we‚Äôll see where all that cheating gets him\n\nMaybe wait until their found guilty, until then keep crying\n\nPep ü§ù Jose\n\nStuff like this is always funny to see though\n\nMade for each other. Might be time to reunite in Turkey.\n\nIt would have caused more of a stir if Fergie had done it with ten fingers, two toes and an erection.\n\nNew Mbappe celly just dropped\n\nwould have been crazy if pep won 13 in his 8-9 years at city.\n\nFr lmao. People forget he has won 12 league titles already.(In Spain and Germany)\n\nhe really bitched the prem bro damn\n\nHe's won 6 titles in 8 seasons and people are calling him a bum after a few weeks of bad form lmao\n\nwhich is why this is best opportunity to do so.\n\nYes he's great but to be fair, any top flite manager with that budget and that team that he walked in to would have done very very well. Especially if you don't have to worry about ffp like the rest of your competitors.\n\nTbh the transfer business was the real killer, he burnt most of that original city team to the ground minus a few standouts. As for the FFP point, it's not as though city were ever head and shoulders over the rest of the league in spending. United and Chelsea have both spent similar, if not higher amounts in the transfer market with much less success. And even if any top tier manager would have done WELL, city have been unstoppable under Pep\n\nThe other teams had to sell a lot of people to make that money up. So 115 is a myth? Only city have those charges, everyone else followed the rules except Everton who got harshly punished early on. No way you can say it's made no difference, if it didn't They wouldn't have done it would they. They were spending more than anyone for a few years, back before building this team. I dunno man, pep has only ever gone anywhere where he has a shit load of money to spend and a team that are already smashing it. I'd like to see it put to the test n stick him at a decent but relatively poor team like brighton or fulham, obviously we won't see that but ya know.. Again I agree he's a great manager and I like him but he's had every advantage a manager could have, I'd never consider him a great like fergie or venger, it's just not the same.\n\n&gt;The other teams had to sell a lot of people to make that money up.\n\nSo did city?\n https://www.football365.com/news/transfers-premier-league-five-year-net-spend-man-utd-man-city\n\n&gt;So 115 is a myth?\n\nI don't contest the 115 charges, although ofc it's rlly 80 charges(still insane) plus 35 charges of city not cooperating, but pep was only around for the last 2 years of the contested period, since the charges are all for things that happened between 2009 and 2018. Yes, there absolutely was some dodgy stuff going on, I don't disagree with that, but up till they're actually convicted I'm not going to discredit Pep's league titles, especially since CAS overturned UEFA's previous conviction against City.\n\n\n\n&gt;I'd never consider him a great like fergie or venger, it's just not the same\n\nI'm not going to say he's the greatest manager of all time or anything yet, especially not in England where that's going to be Fergie unless Pep somehow wins another 8 EPL titles at City, but it's not as though Fergie and Wenger were winning league titles on shoestring budgets. You don't win without spending absurd money\n\nSo you've said yeah the mad stuff happened and they cheated but you won't acknowledge that pep was a part of city or something until they're charged üëçüèª They can pay/cheat their way out of that too. Kinda voids anything else you have to say on him. You've acknowledged that they cheated but won't disregard their achievements from cheating.\nThey spent money, everyone does but not in that way, city paid to be where they are and pep was given that massive advantage from the day he started.\nHe's good but he's never proven how good, not as if he's turned a team round that were struggling and then won stuff....ever I don't think.\n\nWho were city and where were city before oil money? Nowhere. Chelsea 2.0 and he rode that high. Of course don't blame him, fortunes in it. He has an advantage at city so I mean yh it don't really count.\n\nWe don't know how much City has actually spent, given they have a habit of trying to hide their payments.\n\nMy nan could win the title with Man City\n\nIt was good response to the crowds banter. Calm down.\n\nPeps always done stuff like this it‚Äôs nothing new\n\nPep reminding Liverpool fans, how many champions league titles they have\n\nAnd if he walked to his bench without acknowledgement, that would be seen as weakness too\n\nWho you tellin to calm down? Eh? Eh?ü´¥ü´¥\n\nWhat on earth are those ball grabbing emojis\n\nPeople love to see downfall and are ready to push some weird cannon head imagination to further extrapolate such downfall.\n\nHe's showing the titles it took for Liverpools best manager to quit club football.\n\nShowing the number 6 to Liverpool fans really isn‚Äôt the flex you think it is.\n\nüñïüñïüñê\n\nThought it was funny but his interview afterwards saying he expected more respect from the Liverpool fans was a bit mental.\n\n\"You're in the number one spot, while I'm in the number 5 spot\".\n\nThanks, Pep!\n\nPep visiting Anfield always gets peak meme material¬†\n\nPep isn‚Äôt the Angel people would like to portray him to be. He was done for PEDs back in the early 00s\n\nHe's actually reminding us Liverpool fans how many champions league titles we've won, duh\n\nI was thinking the same at first üòÖ\n\nLmao the upvote count is at 115.\n\nHe is becoming Mourinho\n\nI've never seen a champion have such a meltdown. Is the deep lying role that instrumental to his play? This cant all because of Rodri\n\nBitter United fan who hasn't seen EPL cup for ... how long exactly ? Dont worry, Pep has a good chance to catch up with you haha\n\nWhy can u just hold up 1 and 3?\n\n‚ÄúYou‚Äôre nothing special, we lose every week!‚Äù ?\n\nWon it in 8 years tho took ferguson 26 years\n\nFerguson does have 6 fingers on one hand tho\n\nFergie would never do that , he has class\n\nWhy does everything always need to be compared? And overanalysed!!\n\nJose is a twat. Pep is classy and a genius. \n\nThe crowd were singing ‚Äòyou‚Äôre getting sacked in the morning‚Äô, which is ridiculous, maybe banter, so Pep - like we all would - proudly held up 6 fingers for his titles. \n\nImagine the stress he‚Äôs under. The fact you‚Äôve worked so hard for 6 titles. I‚Äôd do the same.\n\nThe mourinho effect ‚Äúwhen a manager starts to loose his shit ‚Äúüí©\n\nNo wonder all his players act the way they do when he is such a clown ü§°\n\n13 titles for 100 years is not at all impressive.\n\nThis is my favourite part about the internet. Stupid opinions like this will stay to come back and laugh to when Pep manages to survive the season.\n\nFunny because if Pep was in the Prem for as long as Fergie, he woukd have double the amount of Prems Fergie has.\n\nHe was taunted by the fans, he taunted them back. I don't see why it has to become a controversy. \n\n(Liverpool fan here for the record. I'm not offended by him making that gesture)\n\nI don‚Äôt get it (I rarely watch football)\n\nHe's turning into the special one\n\n4 in a row. Master in his one class. \nImagine fergie winning a title without getting 7 penalties in 7 games consecutively. \nPep is clear.\n\nTbf Ferguson never went 7 games without winning\n\nHe did, 8 even. 89-90 season. Broke the winless streak with an FA Cup win over Forest then went on to lift the cup.\n\nI stand corrected. Tbf I was 4 in that season.\n\nExcuses!\n\nYou plastic!\n\nI always hate it when people say stuff like this. ‚ÄúOooh wahhh I was only likkle‚Äù it‚Äôs not like you haven‚Äôt had 15 years since to have gone over the season.\n\nWhy, would I, as a 40 year old man, be making the effort to watch football from 35 years ago. Also, tell me where I can watch comprehensive coverage of the 89/90 season? I‚Äôve got a life, family, work and other interests.\n\nYou still are\n\nnever went 4 seasons without dropping the title either\n\nThat was to the City fans. I was there. He did the 6 at the end in the match to the Liverpool fans. He applauded us at one point, we applauded back. It's not like some make it out to be.\n\nPeople acting like 6 PL in 7 yrs isnt absolutely insanse.\nThe crowd threw banter at him, he threw it back. Yall too sensitive these days\n\nI'll tell you something now, he will love it if they beat them, Love it!\n\nIndeed yes, they HAVE won six titles....but for how long will that be the case? Justice awaits....\n\nHe took this game so personal. He could have clapped them off kind of saying they will be back and better but this makes him seem like a child\n\n[deleted]\n\nI do\n\nI do\n\nHe's lost the plot because he's giving a bit of banter to rival fans?\n\nTop banter from the üëëüëëüëëgames back!\n\nso pep has won it 6 times, hasn‚Äôt liverpool won it like 20 times?\n\n19 Times champions of England\n\nbut certain fanbase will have you believe the world got reset with the advent of the Premier League.. in which case we only have 1 :D\n\n[removed]\n\nwhy?\n\nWho the fuck is Josh Wilson-Esbrand\n\nHope you find your sleeping pills and antidepressants again mate so you can give it another go!"

    "all_comment_text": "Look man it had to happen sometime!\n\nHappened at the most critical time \n\nThe important match of the season for them \nSad\n\nI‚Äôm sure they would prefer the unbeaten league season, massive achievement! Flowers for Alalanta too who deserve to win a trophy for their football the past few years.\n\nI think they‚Äôd prefer a cup rather than an extra 3 pts in a league they won 4 weeks ago\n\nYou‚Äôre disregarding the whole unbeaten league season accomplishment. Arsenal invincibles still get a lot of traction for the same accomplishment.\n\nUnderrated comment if pun intended\n\nHe Musso thought about it hard.\n\nExactly. Sooner or later\n\nNo disrespect to Leverkusen, but Atalanta dominated exceptionally.\n\nLookman was on fire\n\nIt was more of a collective effort. Yea he did have a game of his life but the press of this team man. They were so good to not let the tempo build up against them. Great tactical fouls and perfect counter attack setup.\n\nHe was sharp as a razor for his goals, most switched on player for the first one, and then two Outstanding bits of play and finishes. Played magnificently the whole night too, pressing, carrying the ball, bringing teammates into play, creating space etc. \n\nYou're absolutely right that Every single other Atalanta player was also outstanding, and so utterly fluid and united as a team, the definition of a well oiled machine. Even the subs who came on did their jobs to help the gameplan perfectly - el bilal, pasalic, scalvini etc. \n\nTremendously impressive. Happy for them, they've been one of the most entertaining club sides in football for the last 5 or 6 years, they deserved a trophy to immortalise Gasperini's reign and all the great work he's done with this club and so many players. \n\nStill gutted for Leverkusen, going an entire season unbeaten in all competitions and winning a treble would have been a uniquely ridiculous and vast achievement, and it is a bit agonising for them to fall short on the penultimate match, after all those comebacks. But they Are invincible in the bundesliga in their maiden title winning season, and can still complete the unbeaten domestic double (although now, I kind of want kaiseralautern to win that as well) \n\nThe commentators called this a feelgood final while watching atalanta celebrate, and I think that's fair!\n\nFootball is a collective effort game! But did you see the goals he scored and how he scored them?\n\nI feel like the referee should have penalized more those tactical fouls. Atalanta fouled every possible counter attack. There should have been more yellows for stopping chances via foul and foul reiteration. Also I found his refereeing quite strange. He didnt call some clear shirt pullings but a few light touches and shoulder to shoulders were called fouls(for both teams)\n\nLook man, lookman dominated\n\nYeah literally suffocated them. Can't remember seeing a press executed that consistently well for 90 mins\n\nThey did it to Liverpool. :(\n\nAh of course haha, didn't actually catch those games but I can imagine it must have been a similar masterclass\n\nAtalanta*\n\nMy bad\n\nYeah, it was a collective masterclass from the team. Props to them.\n\nTrue Blietzkrieg football from 0‚Äô-90‚Äô\n\nThey were really, REALLY good. Just reinforces how much of their success at Anfield was them being extremely well-drilled and sharp along with Liverpool being very crap that day.\n\nCrazy that just stating a fact that Atalanta dominated could be taken as disrespect lol\n\nThis is both, Atalanta were great today, and Leverkusen weren't up for it.\n\n*Atalanta\n\nAlonso got tactically outdone, his set-up from the very beginning was poor, got to love Gasperini mix of old school physicality and direct technical play\n\nHad grimaldo and frimpong as strikers like what the fuck?\n\nBoth are usually high up the pitch when playing as WB, Alonso trying to go for a fluid front 3 with Wirtz, Adli and Frimpong just didn't work, Wirtz got marked out the game, Adli was useless as false no.9.\n\nWhile Gasperini play was stick it up to the big man and work it from there\n\nAs soon as I saw the line up I thought \"what's Alonso thinking?\"\n\nNot the first time though\n\nHow often did you think that in the season when he totally changed the setup and it worked?\n\nCrazy humbling for Leverkusen. It‚Äôs a shame that it is the end of the fairytale. \n\n100% deserved by Atalanta. Total domination from the first minute to the last.\n\nEverybody thought they‚Äôd win the treble unbeaten. \n\nBut this is why i love football because it likes to prove everybody wrong\n\nEveryone were overlooking Atalanta which in hindsight was a bit ridiculous. On route to the final they beat Marseille, Liverpool (comfortably) &amp; Sporting. None are easy to beat with the individual quality each team had. Fantastic team.\n\nAtalanta is a quality side. They're angry after losing to Juventus in a coppa final\n\nI watched the Coppa Italia final. I did think they would have one eye on the Europa League final\n\nCorrect me if I'm wrong (I only watched part of the second half), but wasn't that moreso because Juventus sorta just parked the bus and only counter attacked after the first goal? Even then, Atalanta were very close to changing the game (Lookman hit the woodwork more than once)\n\nYeah, but Juve should have gotten a clear penalty and the game would have been game over after that.\n\nMaybe Juventus have their number but they're unknown to Leverkusen\n\nI thought they‚Äôd do a Fiorentina (last season)\n\nTbf I think people only wrote Atalanta off because of the ridiculous results Leverkusen have pulled out of the bag seemingly from nowhere this season.\n\nNo way, top serie a teams just have the measure of atalanta more than teams from the rest of Europe.\n\nEveryone? No, sorry :)\n\nNGL, I was one of those everybody. \n\nBut yeah, it‚Äôs why we love the game.\n\nExcept the obvious outcome - Real Madrid winning the UCL\n\nAnd then being beaten by Atalanta in the supercup, right?\n\nWe'll see who has better pact with black magic hahah\n\nAnd Man City winning the epl ü´£\n\nThat's all sports\n\nTbh it would be wild if koln win the pokal this weekend\n\nIt would be but I don‚Äôt think it will happen, Leverkusen now have a taste of what it‚Äôs like to be 2nd best in a final and will probably play that cup final like they have a fire up their asses tbh.\n\nTrue, everyone kept hyping up the Uefa supercup between Leverkusen and Madrid even tho neither of them had even qualified yet.\n\nwas is it really everyone? or did some casual fans just get too hung up about about \"fairytales\" and \"underdog success stories\"? I don't think that going into the final, most people would've said that Leverkusen is clearly superior to Atalanta. on paper they seemed quite comparable actually.\n\nis it really humbling for Leverkusen? they had an absolutely insane season and performed way above how everyone expected. and this performance culminated in reaching the final after all. it's not like they're a team where not winning a final every season is considered a failure, and it's also not like they're a huge and rich club who played against a much smaller club. I don't understand how they got humbled.\n\nIt is a humbling because Leverkusen didn‚Äôt get a look in for the whole game. \n\nIf it was a tighter game then that‚Äôs fine. Just not an ideal day. But the manner in which got beaten was incredible for a side that should be riding so high on confidence.\n\nYeah but 51 games unbeaten and then you lose the most important one 3-0 is a little humbling\n\nAtalanta is the real fairytale\n\nLeverkusen just got absolutely rinsed to be honest, literally dominated from start to finish. \n\nDoesn‚Äôt weaken their season tbf, they‚Äôve been outrageous this year but on the night they were beaten by the better team.\n\nI mean Atalanta have kept stability in coaching and produced some fantastic results over the past few years including recently against Liverpool. I knew they had the potential so I was not incredibly surprised.\n\nThe title should be: Atalanta wins Europa League after playing great football for 8 years straight!\n\nThank you ‚ö´üîµ\n\nNow lose your remaining games so we can get UclüòÇ\n\nForza Roma\n\nDajeeee\n\nAtalanta absolutely destroyed them. Lookman was absolutely unplayable and gave one of the best performances in a European final ever. But the whole team was sensational, Ederson in that midfield was everywhere, Zappacosta was up and down that wing, Ruggeri performing for his home club and completely shutting down Jeremie Frimpong. Masterclass from Atalanta and Gasperini.\n\nI've been watching football for a long time. And I've been told losing one game means you're a fraud.  \n\nSo, Xabi Alonso is a fraud.\n\nThe first 50+ games were just a fluke and he‚Äôs been found out at last\n\nHandsome fraud instead of bald fraud\n\nShocking to say the least. But I think in the long run, this defeat is gonna be a possitive for Leverkusen, championship and finals experience is fundamental if you want to be successful. Gasperini is a seasoned manager, who did his job and totally studied Leverkusen and they're playing style. Xabi has to learn from this for sure. \n\nI really liked that the team was so classy in defeat, they didn't start to foul the rivals or anything like that.\n\nIf we had not enough loses in the past... Neverkusen nickname have not come from no where\n\nOf course it\\`s little disapointing to lose in final, but all i wanted from my team was Bundesliga title, everything else is bonus, we had incredible season and i really really hope that we want fall from Neverloosen  back to Neverkusen\n\nI don't want to ruin anyone's fun, but I don't expect there to be a long run for Leverkusen. my prediction is that they'll have a decent season next year, and afterwards they'll be ravaged by half of Europe and fall back to their usual (or slightly worse) performance. as happened to Ajax, Monaco, Leicester just to name 3 random examples that came to my mind right now.\n\nYou aint\\`t ruining anything. I completely agree with you, this is why i don\\`t care about a loss to Atalanta.\n\n30 years trophyless, ups and downs, birth of Neverkusen...\n\nAnd i do agree with you, with Alonso leaving, team will be picked one by one by bigger clubs, and we will start from the scratch. Just from now on it will be different- now we are spoiled, now we know it\\`s possible for Leverkusen to win Bundesliga, DFB , Euro maybe, we can, because we did it . Gone days \"whatever, we never win, so enjoy football, team, atmosphere\". Years of \" maybe this year\", \"maybe this year\" are comming, and i know that i will never again watch any Leverkusen match again as i did before the Meister.\n\nIt has to happen, unfortunately they lost in the most important match of the season.\n\nAnyway, congratulations to Atalanta, they dominated the match since the beginning and deserved the victory.\n\nIt‚Äôs only the second time I witnessed such domination in an European cup final: first was Barca vs ManUtd with this outstanding header by Messi and then tonight with Atalanta vs Bayer. This impression that the opponent is totally physically tactically powerless. Even the final between Real and Liverpool with the mistakes from Karius were not that dominated by Real.\n\nOhhh I remember thay Barca vs Utd. Absolutely ridiculous and Messi beating Rio Ferdinand to score a header was just unreal.\n\nIt was in 2011 Barca completely destroyed United. In 2009 (Messi‚Äôs header), Xavi was the man of the match.\n\nMilan did it 2 times in 88 and 94 (two 4-0 against Steaua and Barca) but technically i havent witnessed it either\n\nSo does this mean Italy gets 6 teams in the Champions league next year??\n\nOnly if Atalanta finish 5th in the league I think. They‚Äôre currently 5th but could go 4th.\n\nSad to see the narrative being Bayer lost, Atalanta were exceptional out there given the pressure\n\nIt‚Äôs literally their first defeat of the season with them being 2 games away from an unbeaten treble, normally I‚Äôd agree with this perspective but on this occasion Leverkusen losing is definitely the bigger story\n\nWhere‚Äôs the clowns who were trying to tell me Lille are better than Atalanta when I said Villa had an easy route in Europe‚Ä¶\n\nNobody knows\n\n[Can I brag a little? LoL üò¨](https://www.reddit.com/r/ASRoma/s/rBZeSGwUUf)\n\nGrande!\n\nAtalanta were fucking phenomenal.\n\nTbh, i feel like Leverkusen was a bit cocky, and looked down on Atalanta. They were caught off guard and unable to make another miraculous come back. \n\nAtalanta was definitely on fire. They dominated from start to finish. I guess losing italian cup to Juve pissed them off, and they put like 200% effort into this game. It‚Äôs a deserving win for them. They have been playing great football in recent years.\n\nThis is why they won. Because they had just lost a final too.\n\nLeverkusen have been on coast mode a bit it's been nearly a month since they wrapped up the league.\n\nNow the challenge is on them to NOT lose the Cup final..  to a second division team. Now THAT WOULD BE THE STORY\n\nFiorentina lost both Coppa and Conference last season\n\nAtalanta‚Äôs set up set the tone, high pressure, high line, aggressive attack and press. \n\nEarly goal combined with Atalanta‚Äôs set up showed Alonso‚Äôs line up was arguably his first mistake as Leverkusen manager. They had no outball or hold up option up front without Boniface etc and not enough grit in the central midfield without Andrich. \n\nSurprising that Alonso never addressed this as soon as they went 2-0 down. \n\nThat said, sometimes in football a team can just have the game of their life‚Äôs, this is what we seen tonight from Atalanta of Bergamo and individually Lookman produced a career defining performance! \n\nCongrats to Atalanta on their greatest night in their history üîµ‚ö´Ô∏èüîµ‚ö´Ô∏è\n\neveryone who knows the italian league knew that was going to happen and I'm not exaggerating. Bayer stood absolutely no chance since the beginning\n\nExactly, I called it early because Atalanta plays better against possession based teams.\n\nI hope premier league clubs were watching. This is what it takes to be succesfull in europe\n\nWhat? Not more money you mean???\n\nLeverkusen were terrible tonight. They clearly prepped for this game completely wrong and came into this game thinking they had already won\n\nOverprepared for the inevitable, scripted 90+7 equalizer they forgot there's 90 minutes to played first\n\nAtalanta played a perfect game. Just total domination.\n\nThis shows Atalanta are a quality side and Liverpool wasn't a freak result. I wonder why no big clubs are linked with Gasperini though. He's been doing an amazing job.¬†\n\nI'm sold.\n\nGasp to Bayern\n\nBecause he never won anything before this. People forget the fact Atalanta used to battle relegations.\n\nBecause of that inter past record lol\n\nI didn't give Atalanta a hope in hell going in to the game. Thoroughly well done to them\n\nI actually thought they would beat Leverkusen on penalties. No way this team concedes a 96th minute leveller \n\nGreat team\n\nThey had the far more difficult route to the final‚Ä¶the deserved it more\n\nXabi Alonso Out!!\n\nAnd they say Serie A is farmer's league\n\nNobody says that\n\nI knew Atalanta would play good and that they would put up a fight,I thought would be a tough match probably draw heading to extra tome or penalties with Leverkusen winning.Didnt expect this kinda of game and total domination from Atalanta.As a neutral I am happy for Atalanta Gasperini is a real genius only one to defeat Xabi this season.This game doesn't change how great season Leverkusen had.They will also win pokal.Getting domestic double unbeaten is crazy.\n\nLeverkusen had been getting lucky for weeks it was bound to happen.\n\nI had feeling Atalanta was gonna end leverkusen streak\n\nAre they stupid?\n\nMy opinion is that Trent Attyah is the most powerful man on the planet\n\nAnd so ends the fairytale of Xabi Alonso\n\nDisappointing, but fair play to Atalanta who was the better team that match. Yes Leverkusen was exceptionally strong throughout the season, and they deserve to have won as well, but in the end, all boils down to who was the better team. Knowing them, they will do well for dfb pokal to recoup their confidence, and come back stronger next season.\nThat being said, Atalanta have redeemed themselves after that disappointing 0 SoT against Juventus, and of course will be strong as hell next season if they keep their current form\n\nLeverkusen are just not ready for the real monsters\n\nLeverkusen really just hit the restore to factory settings button\n\nTime to sack Xabi , he don't know what he is doing/s\n\nThe only game I watched all season after all the hype. They lose. Cool\n\nSame üòÇüòÇ\n\nThey looked bored of winning .\n\nThere's no shame in losing to a better team on the night....they destroyed Liverpool, played heavy metal football and taught us a lesson,  you can't relax for one minute as they'll punish you....a very good team\n\nI've watched Leverkusen all season and they didn't look themselves. Awful passing, awful finishing, bad decisions. Really looked like the Leverkusen of last season. I was hoping for a Leverkusen win, but that being said Atalanta played tremendously and deserved to win. Leverkusen looked unusually rattled after that first goal, and never found their footing. I think in part it was nerves (the moment was big) and also Atalanta just had the right tactics.\n\nAs I said before. Xabi Alonso faced a good manager for the first time this season, and he lost tactically\n\nI got the feeling that Leverkusen has been partying since the league trophy ceremony. I imagine it was rather difficult for players to refocus and get emotions under check to prepare for this game after basically the best season possible.\n\nMeanwhile Atalanta had it all to play for and definitely felt the hunger.\n\nMaybe this will make them unbeaten again next season\n\nThey can't party now. Kaiserslautern is around the corner\n\nSubbing off your three best players in a cup final is pathetic. \n\nWhat an abysmal end to the season. I know people overhyped the unbeaten run a lot but what an embarrassing way for it to end. Looked miles out of their depth.\n\nThey‚Äôve got another cup final on Saturday‚Ä¶\n\nOnce that game was gone, it was absolutely the right thing to do!\n\nthe trey curse is real [https://x.com/UTDTrey/status/1793353873563824505](https://x.com/UTDTrey/status/1793353873563824505)\n\nHaha\n\nLeverkusen deserved to lose for dropping Boniface. They played without a proper striker for the first half. I don't understand why managers do this, it's so fucking stupid. Just play your best squad, not some weird reverse psychology type bs where you play 5 midfielders and an AM as a striker.\n\nHe‚Äôs been playing like that for several weeks, nothing new\n\nHe played the same team against Roma over the two legs and it worked. Can clearly see what he was aiming for. Atalanta were just better all over the pitch\n\nDoes this mean Roma get CL football by finishing 6th?\n\nAtalanta needs to finish 5th, which is unlikely\n\nOnly if Atalanta finish 5th\n\nThey were lucky throughout this season.\n\nThank god.\n\nguess the treble dream is over now\n\nBecause I bet them to win\n\nI am just glad it happened.\n\nAlonso didn‚Äôt really do anything after lookmans first two goals. He was obviously a threat and should have been double marked, the team should have tightened up defense and relied on counter attacks. They got outplayed possession. Wise\n\nI thought Leverkusens energy and intensity were really good but, and maybe this is a credit to the defending Atalanta did but Leverkusen couldnt get an in offensively all game despite having the eye test of playing focused all they could. Atalanta backline were tremendous, Zappacosta and the defender that plays next to him, and all their players had steel balls and the ref greenlit a rougher game with no bs from the get go.\n\nI don't know about leverkusen.\n\nI don't know why a defender Grimaldo was in the attacking position.\n\nLeverkusen find a way to respect club tradition and blow it at the end ü´°\n\nIts all down hill from here for Xabi\n\nWell it was probably thia unbeatrn run that put too much oressure on them. Deep down they had to know this can't go on forever, and they must have realized that the worst would be to end it in the Europa final. Maybe they did not talk about it but this thought must have been in the back of their heads.\n\nAtalanta. The most hated team\n\nAlonso out /s\n\nSomeone just forgot to give lookman the script\n\nthey still could have an unbeaten domestic campaign\n\ngot relegated with leicester, didn‚Äôt activate the ¬£10m clause to sign. Rudkin strikes again\n\nDeserved win for Atalanta. Wirtz looked lost and I feel La Dea's high press really flustered Leverkusen.\n\nWas at the game. They looked really poor.\n\nHad to happen. Sadly, we were 2 undefeated games away from witnessing an unbelievable season.\n\nQuestion: If given an option to lose the last 2 games of Bundesliga (Bayer were already winners) and not have that invincible league record, instead you win the Europa League...we will obviously take the Europa League, right?\n\nDon't act like they've been playing like prime barca. Many, many times they were just lucky, to score in extra time for a draw. Still a great achievement\n\nWhat a way for the fairytale to end. Atalanta completely dominated the game though.\n\nIt‚Äôs the most one sided European final I‚Äôve seen I a long time, an utter clinic\n\nXabi became Xavi\n\nGasperini üêê\n\nWho knew that having a strong number 9 that could power his way through a defender leaving fast paced players on a 1v1 would work.\n\nFernando santos knew, this was Portugal vs France all over again\n\nof course it was just when i bet a looooot of money on them. fml  \nim cursed man, im telling yall. Lookman turning into prime CR7 in UCL.\n\nstill a huge accomplishment from them, one that won‚Äòt be beaten for a long time.\n\nReally wanted them to go undefeated whole season with treble\n\nIf you watched Atalanta throughout this tournament you would not have been surprised they won last night.\n\nif you don‚Äôt win the last game of the season, who‚Äôs gonna remember ?\n\nFuck I missed the game. Felt like they might of gotten beat tonight. Why was grimaldo playing upfront?\n\nVerdammte schei√üe. Leverkusen were absolutely terrible\n\nMorning everyone.. Hope you're all good! Kinda glad Atalanta won last night too...\n\nTheir tactics are unreal.. basically man to man marking and fight and contest absolutely everything and everyone... was awesome to watch!\n\nAtalanta were really confident despite them facing a team that's unbeaten the entire season\n\nOnce in a lifetime opportunity to win it all and they fuck it up just like that. bummer\n\nIt was always coming. At some point the well runs dry. They were completely outplayed too\n\nFeels like any other time a big shot comes in with their chest puffed up &amp; they get punched in the face early &amp; it changed everything\n\nSerie A fans knew Atalanta were more than capable of pulling this off. Liverpool tie should've been the warning shot to everyone else. They have a relentless press and all Xabi had to do was follow Allegri's gameplan. He got too cute with his 11 and deserves half the blame for the L\n\nWhat did allegri plan in the coppa final? I've read somewhere that Atlanta got 0 SOT?\n\nHe gave them the ball and said good luck trying to score\n\nThat's not as simple like u said..\n\nyes it is lol they scored first and sat in a low block after and counterattacked them all game long\n\nit's the same boring way Juventus always plays\n\nLook man, shit happens.\n\nThrashed, it was a thrashing. It's like they forgot how they won 51 matches. Terrible positioning, poor player selection, and just all around shite performance. There are some obvious weak points in that squad that they hope they can fix by bringing in some more talent in the summer. Tapsoba needs to be replaced for sure. Guy looks lost every time I catch a Leverkusen match.\n\nXabi was on Xavi mode.\n\nIt had to happen in one of the most important matches for them. Sadge\n\nLeverkusen got played off the park to be honest, brilliant performance by Atalanta\n\nAtalanta were the better side throughout. Leverkusen seemed to rush things too much with Xhaka giving away a lot of passes in the early stages.\n\nLook man, Lookman absolutely dominated the entire pitch\n\nI did not see it coming\n\nBayer looked nervous from minute zero. They played horrendously. I thought it would be trouble from the moment neither Boniface or Schick were in the starting line-up, because Wirtz in the false 9 role has looked their worst set-up to me. Not to mention, Wirtz is still coming back from injury. That said, Atalanta absolutely showed up with energy, poise, and confidence. They looked like apex hunters to the scared deers of Bayer yesterday. It had to happen sometime, and I'm glad Bayer were the first to take an invincible Bundesliga league run. Hopefully, the team and Xabi learn from this and take Champions League by storm next year.\n\nWhy german football always loose against italian football ??\n\nAnd if your mind's blown by that, OP, how about this? Ademola Lookman (Atalanta's hero last night) won the match by scoring his first *ever* senior hat-trick\n\nAs an AS Roma supporter I was sure we were going to break the record. We had a VERY unfortunate own goal that broke the doors open, and then the last minute goal was just expected. If we didn‚Äôt need to attack and could only defend, we might have done it, but unfortunate circumstances were unfortunate circumstances.\n\nnever thought this would happen, but all great things end\n\nIt was a good run¬†\n\nThey think they will win easily, but no. Lookman cooked them"

Scottish dudes have been fighting in every British war since 1707 at least and the Scots definitely do not have any right to claim innocence in Ireland\n\nEh, we don't claim innocence - this sort of misses the complex dynamics of Scots and Irish immigration towards each other over the centuries.\n\nIt isn't as simple as the Union was signed and then pure-blood Scots existed in a British bubble for 316 years. Someone like James Connolly is a good example of this.\n\nI think it's just anti British rather than anti British soldier.\n\nI knew plenty of Scots(inc Celtic fans) in the Scots guards, it is just a weird fringe view among some Celtic/Liverpool fans, mostly stemming from Northern Ireland conflict. Remembrance is predominately about the world wars\n\nIts definitely not a fringe view among celtic fans\n\nLizzy‚Äôs in a box üé∂\n\nI thought it was meant to be anti war but not anti soldier,  all soldiers ?\n\n[removed]\n\n[removed]\n\n[removed]\n\nYeah, about 280 000 of them.\n\nBut it is a weird view for the Scotts to suddenly act like they weren‚Äôt some of the biggest perpetrators and benefactors of those atrocities to gain wealth and power\n\nIt's about the British rule in Ireland, Celtic is a Scottish football club with strong Irish roots\n\n\n\n&gt;It's about the British rule in Ireland,\n\nFor which Scotland was heavily involved in, from the Ulster plantations to the troubles.\n\nWhich Celtic fans are opposed to, so I don't get your point.\n\nThey even had colonial ambitions of their own. Just didn‚Äôt work out and it was better for them to muck in with the British empire. \n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_colonization_of_the_Americas#:~:text=In%201696%2C%202%2C500%20Scottish%20settlers,(0.61%20km2)%20each.\n\nLike I see other commenters mentioning, Celtic fans are culturally Irish (and largely ethnically Irish for that matter).\n\nThe Celtic v Rangers rivalry is microcosm of Irish vs Northern Irish/English tensions. The people living in the areas that supported Celtic historically were Catholic Irish immigrant neighborhoods, the rangers fans live bed in Protestant neighborhoods that were ethnically mostly English and Scottish.\n\nI get that, but I‚Äôm trying to point out the hypocrisy of the commenter I was responding to. The reason why there is a large Irish population in Glasgow is because of its status as ‚Äòthe second city of the empire.‚Äô Glasgow grew to be a wealthy city on the back of the British empire, drawing even Irish immigrants to try and share in the fruits of the empire. All I‚Äôm saying is that nobody‚Äôs without sin, but the attempted white washing of involvement in past crimes by Scott‚Äôs and even the Irish gets tiresome.\n\nIdk that I agree that people moved there to \"share in the fruits of the empire\" as much as Ireland literally couldn't support it's population anymore and a huge number of people had no choice but to immigrate. Glasgow had work, but those Irish neighborhoods were also the face of urban poverty and the quality of life was not great. A lot of the Irish descendants in Glasgow viewed it more as we've been reduced to this, rather than we are fortunate to be here.\n\nI agree that most were not living in luxury, but the same can be said of a lot of the Scottish population of the city too, much like the English population in London. What I‚Äôm saying is that people move where there is work. There was work in Glasgow because of the wealth of the empire flowing through its ports, ergo sharing (albeit small) the fruits of the empire. Much like how, to many of Britain‚Äôs detractors, every Englishman shared the fruits of the empire.\n\nKeep telling yourself that fannybaws. People are welcome to join the army for shite money and shoot Arabs for US global hegemony but dinnae expect me to stay silent or get all misty eyed about \"our boys\".\n\nI do agree that we shouldn't be in the middle east, they're plenty able to shoot each other without western help.\n\nTypical scoobied take. Without any western help? What is Israel murdering civilians in the tens of thousands with right now? British and American weapons with unlimited logistical, diplomatic, economic and military support from the west. You sound like you get your news from local radio.\n\nThere's something cultish to me about the reluctance to criticise, and even find excuses, for Celtic.\n\n An individual boos remembrance they are a cunt, football supporters boo it they are just too principled. I don't think much thought at all goes into this.\n\nHave you tried considering it from the point of view of victims of the British Army's actions - i.e. Bloody Sunday? \n\n\"Please stand while we honour a soldier who massacred your civilians and escaped justice with the protection of the State. Buy a poppy and the money will go to a charity that supports this man.\"\n\nI dunno, I'd say it would be more cultish to go along with that. Possibly cuntish too.\n\nBit of a technicality at this point seeing as how many terrorists and war criminals have since been released from prison or never even went in the first place yet we're still free to vote Sinn Fein.\n\nAt some point, especially in a conflict like the North you have to let it go. I say this as an Irishman, unpopular though it may be with many of my brethren.\n\nMost ex soldiers who I know who served in the North, and I know a lot, are perfectly decent people.\n\nI'm pretty sure that soldiers who served in WW1 and WW2 weren't universally blameless either.\n\nA minutes silence for the dead isn't asking the earth and I'd say the same for a minutes silence for the dead in the Troubles even though it includes some terrible people on all sides.\n\nAre people asked to stand to honour war criminals from the IRA, or only from the British Army? \n\nDo we buy paper flowers to honour and provide money to the soldiers of the IRA, or only the British Army? \n\nI don't agree with honouring and supporting war criminals. Remembrance and the Poppy Appeal do allow for that. I'm not aware of any such State sanctioned thing for the IRA?\n\n&gt;I say this as an Irishman, unpopular though it may be with many of my brethren.\n\n&gt;Most ex soldiers who I know who served in the North, and I know a lot, are perfectly decent people.\n\nIt seems a bit odd you're an Irishman who knows \"lots of\" British soldiers, I wonder where you live? I do know a few ex-servicemen. Like everyone, some are better than others.\n\nOk but only one of those things happens\n\nA minute's silence and other memorials for victims of the troubles including war criminals are not uncommon.\n\nSo what do you think didn't happen?\n\nLet it go???? Then surely this remembrance silence crap at football needs to be let go? The same people criticising fans for booing or not wearing a silly flower are the same ones who are up in arms about footballers wearing rainbow laces, or kneeling\n\nWhat if they're not the same people?\n\nPersonally I think it's fine for footballers to not wear the poppy *or* not wear rainbow laces. Are *you* that consistent seeing as how you brought it up? I'd love to know.\n\nJust remember people bitching in this thread are going on about disrespecting men and women who gave their lives to free Europe from the Nazis.\n\nThat's what side you're on.\n\nHave a think about it.\n\n&gt;There's something cultish to me about the reluctance to criticise, and even find excuses, for ~~Celtic~~ the British Army\n\nPeople disturb it at other places as well. A Northampton town did it this year and it caused quite a stir. \n\nBut everywhere else even their own side call them out on it and they are ostracised.\n\nYou won‚Äôt find Liverpool fans booing Remembrance Sunday or soldiers, unless they‚Äôre Irish/Scottish and being melts. But certainly never inside of Anfield. just anything to do with tories or the monarchy.\n\nDid you not read the post your responding to? He‚Äôs telling you why right there. Rememberence is ‚Äúpredominantly‚Äù about the world wars, the other part is the honoring of English soldiers who killed people in Ireland. Even James McClean said the same thing.\n\nLiverpool fans must have registered their protest by remaining silent then ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\n\nHow are Irish people supposed to acknowledge a sad day for the people who killed our people in the name of the crown. Why should Celtic fans hold silence? Should Argentineans also hold silence? \n\nI‚Äôll tel you what guys! A Remembrance Day for world wars! Yes! A rememberenve day for soldiers who killed my country men in my country?! Fuck right off and that‚Äôs right you too Keano wearing the poppy you prick\n\nScousers like to pretend they aren't English, so not surprising there.\n\nLiverpool boo the national anthem, they don't distrub any remembrance tributes it's entirely different and fuck all to do with Northern Ireland.\n\nLiverpool fans boo the national anthem because they feel that the British establishment such as the Thatcher government shafted the city (managed decline, Hillsborough etc.) and it's a very left leaning city \nThey don't distrupt remembrance day tributes and it's nothing to do with Northern Ireland\n\nNot even anti-British, just anti British revisionist history and imperialism.  \n\nCertainly not anti British people, the ones today who are just living their lives not profiting from the blood of hundreds of millions but just stop romanticizing people like Cromwell and acknowledge the horrible things done by many of these soldiers. \n\nFind a way to acknowledge the just sacrifice without honoring atrocity. \n\nMaybe chat GPT could help IDK.\n\nNo one does a minutes silence for Cromwell.\n\n‚ÄúRomanticising Cromwell‚Äù what the bloody hell are you on about?\n\nWho decided that and made it law? It's still held on 11th November at 11am to mark the end of the First World War. It's purely symbolic, which means you can choose what it means to you, or ignore it completely.\n\n&gt;which means you can choose what it means to you, or ignore it completely.\n\nConsidering the continuous criticism and harassment James McClean has faced for not wearing the poppy, it's not as simple as \"just ignore it\". Those who do choose to ignore it are chastised.\n\nThe guy gets the same every year. It's not like it's the first time. He's put his cards on the table, they just chose to make a big deal out of it.\n\nI don't think it's right to chastise James Mclean either, but to me that's just as wrong as loudly protesting the silence. Both are active attacks against a personal choice.\n\nHe hasn't loudly protested it, people keep asking him why he doesn't wear the poppy and he has responded with his reasons.\n\nI didn‚Äôt say he loudly protested it. I said that the attacks against him are loudly protesting his refusal to wear the poppy, which is just as bad as loudly protesting the minutes silence.\n\nAh I see, apologies.\n\nIt's not just an individual interpretation when mainstream media outlets start parroting this view too, from Nick Ferrari @ LBC to the DailyMail - all of them have taken up the cause that remembrance day is for all soldiers and so it's become mainstream. Whether you like/agree with that or not\n\nThis might be surprising to you, but you can also choose to ignore mainstream media.\n\n[deleted]\n\nThe Celtic fans weren't protesting poppies, they were protesting the minute's silence. The two are connected of course but you don't need to wear a poppy to honour the remembrance. Besides, if you visit the Poppy appeal's website it talks about 1944.\n\nExactly. Even before WW2, British soldiers were committing atrocities in Ireland. \n\nI'll be forever grateful to all those who fought in both WWs. But I can't extend that gratitude beyond that, as it has now become. And I have family who've served in the British army....makes for some fun family discussions.\n\nScots are Brits.\n\nThe Irish, I understand, Brits oppressed them but the Scots have been fighting as the British for so long.\n\nI thought the remembrance day (in it's various format ) was a global thing. 11th of November is always observed as a day to remember those who have lost their lives fighting for their countries, regardless of whether that is UK, USA, France, Germany etc. it's not just a British thing\n\nIt always makes me laugh that folk think the British empire was built purely by the English. The English, the Scottish, the Welsh, the Irish and folk from every land the British colonized took part in expanding its control. Nobody is \"innocent\". Yet it's always the English to blame.\n\nIt's about individuals that have given there life its not saying every single British soldier is a good person.\n\nEither way it's pretty much only associated with the two world wars by 90% of people and the poppy is a ww1 symbol.\n\nThat's not why they're booing. It has nothing to do with the wars in Europe.\n\nI thought it was about WW1?\n\nIt was until the second world war, then it sort of encompassed most conflicts but obviously the world wars are the big focus\n\nAnd they just don't give a fuck about any service members who served after WW2? Seems a bit mean to not remember their service or offer them any of the money raised.\n\nI assume that's how it works given the sheer number of people that love to say \"It's about the world wars!!! They defeated the Nazis!!!!\" every time someone (usually James McClean) says they cannot support an army that massacres their community.\n\nI mean surely that's how it works because otherwise it's perfectly reasonable to not want to partake in a charity appeal that will benefit the very men who massacred your community.\n\nThis is why it‚Äôs such an issue now. It‚Äôs classed as a remembrance for ALL British soldiers. A great example of how this can cause conflict is the Troubles and James Maclean has spoken about this very well. \n\nAlso, the only reason there‚Äôs poppies on football shirts is because Leicester did it back in 2003 to raise some money for charity. Football never did anything before that. But, as with everything in the UK, it became heavily politicised and now it means much more than it was ever meant to be. \n\nInstead of it being a moment of reflection for fallen soldiers, it‚Äôs now a case of national identity and if you‚Äôre against the poppy then you‚Äôre against Britain etc.\n\nAnd many Scots died for no reason other than the greed of the crown in the thousands of other conflicts and genocides that built the british empire.\n\nThe Scots were some of biggest colonists in the British empire¬†\n\nDoes it get boring being this purposefully obtuse when you know about the atrocities in Ireland and other countries.\n\nIf you reply to me saying you‚Äôre unaware or something along those lines then why are you commenting on something you know nothing about in the first place.\n\nI'm northern Irish you lizard. I know all about it. The British army isn't the same as it was then, but remembrance has always been focused on the world wars.\n\nSame old bollocks every time.\n\nReally did someone tell the SAS when they were wiping out Iraqi and Afghan families and planting weapons to justify it? https://www.declassifieduk.org/whitehalls-cover-up-of-sas-killings-in-afghanistan/\n\nIt's absolutely not though. 10000 veterans in London hardly fought the Nazis. \n\nThe British legion's own ads make it very clear it's about supporting all British army veterans\n\nSo you absolutely were being purposefully obtuse, got it üëçüèª\n\nAye have a good life anyway mate.\n\nWestminster ordered tanks onto the streets of Glasgow. That and the horrors in Ireland makes the fans' sentiments understandable.\n\nRememberance day is not solely about fighting Nazis. They weren't snubbing brave Scots that fought in WW2.\n\nAnd Irish\n\nThey aren‚Äôt Scottish\n\nIt's about remembering the cost of war on all sides. \n\nPeople wanna make it about politics so they can oppose it, forgetting that the people we remember gave their lives so they have a country that allows them the freedom to do so.\n\nIt's an Irish club in Scotland\n\nBut the Irish stood back and watched. Irish leader even sent a condolence letter when hitler died.\n\nNovember 11 marks the end of WW1, not WW2.\n\nYes but remembrance is not just for WW1, otherwise we would also have remembrance events on VE and VJ day\n\nYou don't ? Where I'm from we have events for November 11 and May 8.\n\nIt wasn't at Celtic, it was at Kilmarnock. Celtic were the away fans disrespecting the home ground's minute silence, which makes it even worse\n\nThey'll wheel out the excuse of the poppy referring to all conflicts instead of just WW1/WW2 these days but the poppy is different from the minute's silence. The minute's silence is at 11:11 on 11/11, Armistice Day, because it commemorates the end of WW1. There's no reason to disrespect that other than to be a massive prick\n\nShould the opposition, whose ground the game was played at, not have the opportunity to commentate the fallen? If Celtic fans don‚Äôt wish to do that, it‚Äôs not to much to ask that they remain the concourse.\n\nExcept it was a Kilmarnock game at Rugby Park.\n\nsometimes you already know which team it is before clicking.\n\nI thought it was a toss up between either Liverpool or Celtic before clicking, but didn't think I heard any chanting when watching the Liverpool game at the weekend\n\nLiverpool completely respected the minutes silence. \n\nThey then clapped the opposition goalkeeper (as they always do), the keeper ignored it and got booed, but the crowd respected the silence. \n\nThey only boo the national anthem.\n\nNah Liverpool don‚Äôt do that. They know the city lost so many, like everywhere. \n\nI mean so did Glasgow, but you know what Celtic are like.\n\nCeltic are like‚Ä¶established by Irish men who had English army soldiers come forcibly into their country &amp; homes, murdered 30 innocent men and children at a GAA match, among countless other atrocities committed across several centuries by the English monarchy‚Ä¶but oh no they wont sing a song\n\nEdit: oh no they wont stay silent *\n\nThey're welcome to use the time to remember the IRA dead if they wish, or maybe all the innocent people killed in IRA atrocities. Or maybe the 200,000 Irishmen that fought in WW1, 35,000 of them losing their lives, remember them. \n\nThe pettiness of it all though is just pathetic.\n\nWe can remember those who fought for our country by our own means, not by someone else‚Äôs which includes honouring the lives of those who murdered our own. The IRA didn‚Äôt have to exist, it was built after the actions of the British monarchy after our population was halved (still hasn‚Äôt recovered) in the 1840-50s where millions died of starvation, despite us producing enough food to feed everyone - but the monarchy took it all the sold it to the South Americas.\n\n&gt;We can remember those who fought for our country by our own means.\n\nThey didn't fight for Ireland though, did they. The 200,000 were in the British Army.\n\nLmfaoooo is that what you are taught little guy? \nMore food was imported into Ireland during the famine than exported- fact. The british provided more aid than every single country combined and doubled- fact. The majority of the landowners that caused the famine where Irish- fact. \n\n\n&gt;The IRA didn‚Äôt have to exist\n\nNo it didnt instead they decided to blow up innocent children.\n\n&gt;We can remember those who fought for our country by our own means\n\nYep and you also honour your 'soilders' especially the ones who blew up kids. So yeah I can live lumping some cunts into remembrance day if your going to honour children killers.\n\nAdding ‚Äú- fact‚Äù to something doesn't actually make it fact, you imported cheap (probably slave labour) Americans maize which we had 0 facilities or infrastructure to cope with, while exporting all of our more substantial, traditional foodstuffs. 682,000 imported tons of maize! Which had to be milled twice, while we had zero infrastructure. Read about ‚ÄúLord‚Äù Trevelyan, Cromwell, Boycott, just to get a small glimpse at their atrocities and terrible acts. No one person ‚Äúcaused‚Äù the famine, it was a blight, a food disease that spread and spread, while queen victoria who was supposed to be our monarch sat on her fancy chair not giving a shite! She STOPPED the ottoman empires aid offering because it was more than she gave! I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll reply with more lies ‚ò∫Ô∏è, but where did I say we honour the IRA? We don‚Äôt. That‚Äôs the difference between the Irish and English,  we know our history, we face it and we don‚Äôt try impose honour systems onto others because we know the IRA of the troubles were bad and yes children killers, but in no comparable fashion to the British Army &amp; Monarchy, who are still lauded over to this day\n\n&gt;Adding ‚Äú- fact‚Äù to something doesn't actually make it fact, you imported cheap (probably slave labour)\n\nNope, we ended slave labour.\n\n&gt;while queen victoria who was supposed to be our monarch sat on her fancy chair not giving a shite! She STOPPED the ottoman empires aid offering because it was more than she gave! \n\nAgain another urban legend that has been repeated and repeated but was made up in a newspaper 140 years ago... after the famine had already happened. If you actual have a shit you would actually learn the whole story instead of just repeating what you see on reddit as fact.\n\n&gt;Americans maize which we had 0 facilities or infrastructure to cope with, \n\nBro that's not even the aid I referenced, what are you smoking? \n\n&gt;Read about ‚ÄúLord‚Äù Trevelyan, Cromwell, Boycott, just to get a small glimpse at their atrocities and terrible acts\n\nMate I studied this in Uni to get my qualifications...\n\n&gt;but where did I say we honour the IRA? We don‚Äôt. \n\nAh so all those thousands turning up to celebrate known child killers is just a coincidence. The Irish include the IRA in their day of honour, they also honour the Irish who fought for Britain... yep even the ones who helped colonise india.\n\n&gt;we don‚Äôt try impose honour systems onto others because we know the IRA of the troubles were bad and yes children killers\n\nSo in response you impose your shouting and jeering at someone elses stadium even though no one forces you to join in? What a weird victim complex you have.\nYou guys absolutely honour the IRA, we see it every year. \n\n&gt;we know our history, we face it \n\nSo why arent all those child killers in Irish jails then? You want to be so morally  correct yet you laud people that blow up kids.\n\n&gt;but in no comparable fashion to the British Army &amp; Monarchy, who are still lauded over to this day\n\nI'm sorry are you trying to get out of children killers by shouting about the British monarchy?\n\nWe dont need a poppy to remember our dead and we don't need to co opt British Imperialism just to make some spineless Brits happy.\n\nIt sends a message\n\nThe pettiness over 600 years of oppression and genocide of a people. Yeah so petty they should honour the establishment that did that‚Ä¶..\n\nPeople with Irish roots having a minutes silence for British soldiers is like British people having a minutes silence for the Nazi soldiers.\n\nWhilst there were wrongs done during the Troubles, suggesting it was on a par with Nazi atrocities displays a frankly ridiculous level of ignorance.\n\nHowever taking the point, we're \\~80 years on, I can spare a thought for normal Germans who were killed in the war.\n\nI do think the potato famine and the genocidal actions taken by the British could be seen as Nazi like.\n\nmountainous dependent terrific automatic ink coherent nail cause history joke\n\n *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev/home)*\n\nFunny isn‚Äôt it that the side that turned a blind eye to the Nazis during the war, also disregard the memory of those who fought them. \nMakes you think.\n\nWe actively helped the British army in several ways during WW2, but ok insinuate us as antisemites\n\n&gt;We actively helped the British army in several ways during WW2\n\nNo you did not. You berated and attacked Irish soilders that fought against Hitler, you sent a condolence to Germany when Hitler died, your ambassador wanted Germany to use Ireland as a back door into Britain. You want countries to own up to shit, start with your own.\n\nCompletely untrue, yes our Taoiseach did send a letter of condolence which was a terrible idea, one of many terrible ideas by De Valera who had Michael Collins shot, he was determined to abide to the appearance of neutrality. In fact, if it wasn‚Äôt for Maureen Sweeney, Irish weather master in Co. Mayo, the battle of Normandy would likely have been a complete failure!, should she have not reported adverse weather conditions on the horizon which led to the delay of the invasion until more suitable weather conditions. She changed the course of history that day. Ireland also helped by sending German troops that accidentally landed in Ireland up to Northern Ireland, not setting them free as a neutral country would. Aswell as sending food exports to the uk, having to ration food ourselves, and also allowing British aircraft to fly in our airspace. Oh boy you are a little hater aren‚Äôt ya\n\n&gt;if it wasn‚Äôt for Maureen Sweeney, Irish weather master in Co. Mayo, the battle of Normandy would likely have been a complete failure!\n\nNo the battle wouldnt have been a complete failure, the sea invasion was never in doubt twas just air visibility but hey at least you feel like you contributed!\n\nThe Irish burned effigies of British people in the streets on the onset of war and wished for a german victory. The IRA was bombing Britain just prior to the war and then met up with German agents in Berlin in 1940, did you forget about Opertaion Dove? \n\n\n&gt;Aswell as sending food exports to the uk, having to ration food ourselves,\n\nBrother we had to support *you* \n\nYou conveniently missed out the horrendous treatment that the irish Soilders received. 'After the war they faced discrimination, lost their rights to pensions, and were barred from holding government jobs. They were finally formally pardoned by the Irish Government in 2013'\n\n[removed]\n\nYour brave soldiers murdered innocent boys and girls on the streets of Derry and Belfast, we will remember that ü´°\n\nI‚Äôm well aware. Just as I‚Äôm aware over 1m Britons died during WWI and WWII, as did many Irish.\n\nRemembrance has gone past WW1 and WW2, though. Its now for all British Armed Forces.\n\nYeah plenty of Irish were killing other Irish people in Belfast and Derry too in those times and from recent experiences of going back to visit family, mindsets haven‚Äôt changed much\n\nI'm a rangers fan. Like most from glasgow, I have Irish ancestry. I think genocide in Ireland is a fairly reasonable thing to take a stance against.\n\n\nWhat's more, world war one is the genesis of the black and tans, and the origin of the link between celtic and Palestine, seeing as the British army sent them to Palestine to give them the same treatment they'd given the Irish after the rising.¬†\n\n\nSo anyone sat in this thread arguing \"it's only about world war one\" should understand the history before acting that makes any difference.¬†\n\nThe minute silence doesn‚Äôt remember the world war soldiers anymore, it‚Äôs every British soldier, including the ones that committed atrocities against Irish and catholics,that‚Äôs why Celtic have a problem with it\n\nThat‚Äôs their view. Many families just want to remember those who were killed during service. Nothing to do with ireland.\n\nQuick google search will show you its for all British soldiers who died in worldwide conflicts [why would families of victims of these crimes want to remember them](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_war_crimes)\n\nYou won‚Äôt find Scousers booing remembrance Sunday or soldiers in general, military recruitment has never been a problem in Liverpool and still isn‚Äôt today (as much as it is anywhere else anyway) I‚Äôve met plenty of scousers who served. \n\nIt‚Äôs only tories and monarchy boos you‚Äôll get from Liverpool fans.\n\nWhaaaaa!!! Your country has done some awful things. You can't possibly still be surprised that some clubs don't like it.\n\nMaybe if your own fans respected other countries national anthems, then you might not sound like such a hypocrite.\n\nYou realise it's not even mainly English fans that boo other national anthems right..??\n\nLiterally every team does it, some even more than the British teams.. \n\nEvery country has done some awful things. I'm sorry but chanting through a minutes silence to remember people who have died in war is just stupid.\n\nDidn't even have to look twice.\n\nAs a Scottish Celtic fan with Irish roots, if the British establishment chose to honour just WW1 and WW2, we would be more likely to honour such wishes.\n\nThe Troubles being a part of this wish is wrong. The British committed all kinds of violence in Ireland, especially in Derry, during The Troubles. One particular incident was Bloody Sunday. Innocents were killed. The British government covered up what happened for decades. The IRA killed innocents too. More civilians died than soldiers. Loyalists killed 48%, Republicans 39% and security forces 10%. Both sides were wrong, using civilians as weapons to try and force the other stop their political agenda. All killed.\n\nThe Troubles should be remembered for the brutality and violence and the lessons which have to be learned from it in regards to treatment of civilians. \n\nInstead they add it to the list of wars which should be remembered with a poppy, which includes the world wars, which were to stop imperialism (ironic from a British perspective especially) and fascism. \n\nJust my thoughts. I don‚Äôt mind getting downvoted because this is my honest opinion.\n\nScrew the IRA, screw the British state security forces of the time and screw the Ulster loyalists for their brutality.\n\ndon‚Äôt forget the soldiers who committed war crimes in iraq. the british is insanely hypocritical when they pretend to care about the soldiers they send to die for their own interests so why are we forced to engage in their fake displays of remembrance. \n\ni‚Äôm from ireland i go to celtic games as often as i can. my great uncle was beaten with the end of a gun by a soldier and has a scar on his chest from being attacked by him. i wouldn‚Äôt mourn the death of him at all.\n\nI don‚Äôt have enough knowledge of Iraq but from what I‚Äôve heard, the whole war was pointless with the lies about WMDs in Iraq. They are hypocritical.\n\nI wouldn‚Äôt mourn the death of an asshole like that either and I‚Äôm sorry your great uncle went through that.\n\nA lot of Brits were against the Iraq war. I dont think there will be many, if any, Brits who supported the Iraq war. And there certainly wont be many, if any who support the war in hindsight.\n\nAmen\n\nIt's a tough one. Some fellow celtic fans here can explain so eloquently as to why it is this way every year and I'm in agreement with them. I detest the pageantry of remembrance, the sickening patriotism is what signed young lads up for their death in ww1. What always troubles me is that I know there's a large section of the celtic support that are just doing it out of spite and because \" I'm a celtic fan and this is what we do\" rather than have any real opinion the troubles or Palestine.\n\nI agree with you about signing young lads up. The tactics used by the British government were disgusting and was very similar to the alpha-beta mindset shit you see today - they got women to put feathers in the pockets of men who hadn‚Äôt signed up. I‚Äôm a pacifist myself and think war is pointless. WW2 I can slightly justify due to fascism rising.\n\nI hate people using being a fan of a club as an excuse rather than it being their personal belief. They‚Äôre the type who follow the crows and don‚Äôt fly with the doves.\n\nThe meaning of rembrance Sunday and the poppy was hijacked by the British establishment around the time of the Iraq war. It‚Äôs a complete nonsense now. \n\nAs absolutely always, keep politics out of sport actually only means politics they don‚Äôt like.\n\nThese poppy weeks seem to be getting bigger and longer every year. When did the 2 weeks stuff become a thing? It used to be just that weekend. And everything can be avoided if they just let Celtic play at home that week and they can ignore it.\n\nIf teams don't have a home game on the weekend of Remembrance Sunday, they'll have a minutes silence at their last home game before that weekend. That's why Arsenal for example had a minutes silence before the Liverpool game on October 27th, because they had all away games afterwards.\n\nAnd these back to back weekends are only a new phenomenon. \n\nThere's a weird fetish for minutes silences/applauses at football matches. I get it for massive tragedies like Valencia or when club or national legends die but you get all sorts now a days. \n\nI remember Ireland had 11 minute/silences at home in a row at one stage. And it was only broken because we had back to back home games and nobody died in those 4 days. Everyone was getting them. Radio presenters (not even sport related), regional administrators that nobody had heard of.\n\nLots of clubs lost players during wars and also had groups in the armed forces who supported various teams. \n\n&gt;West Ham had a battalion of 1000 soldiers, 3/4 of them either killed or severely injured\n\nhttps://www.footballandthefirstworldwar.org/the-west-ham-pals/\n\nAll clubs have similar examples and should be entitled to remember them.\n\nI never knew about the West Ham Battalion and I'm from East London! \n\nMind you, I grew up an Orient fan, and we actually had our whole first team sign up together after a match. 3 of our players were killed at the Somme and their pictures are still up in the stadium. \n\n  \nOne of their great great great nephews laid a wreath on Saturday. \n\n  \n[https://x.com/leytonorientfc/status/1855603818005946664](https://x.com/leytonorientfc/status/1855603818005946664)\n\nIt‚Äôs so pointless since it‚Äôs used for anyone nowadays\n\nI mean it is literally remembrance weekend.. this has happened for years and years.\n\nNot at the football. The whole poppy and rememberance thing during football is a new thing, only started in 2010.\n\nThe whole thing has became politicised and pushed since the war on terror began. Pushed by politicians.\n\nThat‚Äôs too simple and logical mate\n\nYeah, it definitely feels like it‚Äôs getting longer every year. Used to just be a day or two. Letting Celtic play at home that week would be a simple fix\n\nWhen the Brits and Americans realised how much of a hypocrite they have become\n\nIssue stems from extending from WW1/2 into everything involving British soldiers, which will include the crimes committed in Ireland.\n\nIf it was just WW1/2 then you'd have no issue, Irish men fought in WW1, my great-grandfather for example.\n\nThey fought for that right for Celtic fans to express their opinion, in the exactly same vein that people can call them every name under the sun.\n\nAt this point, I'd prefer people to move on rather than this getting constantly dragged up every year, but I'll respect the right for people to say as they please.\n\nI mean it's a tricky thing\n\nFor one thing I agree Armistice Day has become massively over-politicized (since the so-called War on Terror, really) and there are some really big issues around the historical legacy of the British army in terms of colonialism and more recent history.\n\nOn the other hand Celtic fans were singing pro-IRA songs at that same match.  Said IRA having offered their support to a Nazi invasion of Northern Ireland in 1939.  And I think we'd agree the Nazis were defo bad guys and probably best to keep a wee bit quiet on that whole side of things on 11/11.\n\nSo I'm not sure I'd judge them as principled or intelligent objectors per se.\n\nDon‚Äôt bother mate, people (Americans) on this site love the IRA\n\n[deleted]\n\nI know fine well why some Celtic fans 'support' the IRA.  I also know fine well how arseholes attach themselves to excuses and 'causes' to justify their own bigotry.\n\nThis is the same every November, it‚Äôs a bore. Not everyone agrees with it. Move on. Also the article says James McLean is northern Irish. James McLean has 100 caps for the Republic of Ireland. Not Northern Ireland. He identifies as Irish not Northern Irish. That‚Äôs his right.\n\nGames back\n\nThe whole point in free speech and fighting to protect our supposed freedoms is you have to take the rough with the smooth. You want too play the knobhead that's your right. But I get to call you a knobhead.\n\nThe problem is they are disrupting someone else silence.\n\nDon‚Äôt wear a poppy if you like but don‚Äôt ruin other peoples way of commemorating it.\n\n[deleted]\n\nStain you say.\n Nobody is downplaying anything. better than most complete agreement. The supposed freedoms quote was more critique on the noose getting tighter. A rule for thee, but not for me type of thing.\n\nIt‚Äôs not like they went to a remembrance event, they went to a football match and had politics pushed on them. This act of remembrance is a political act. Choosing not to respect it is also a political act. \n\nWhatever your views on remembrance, it‚Äôs hypocritical to criticise one political act over another.  People at football games have the right to stay silent and the right not to.\n\nFair play\n\nHang your banners all you want but at least leave the silence for those who want to respect it. Bad from the ref ending the silence early too, let them embarrass themselves further and allow those who want to pay their respects to do so.¬†\n\nThe ref was in a no win situation. He‚Äôd have been criticised for allowing the disrespect to continue too\n\nDaily reminder that C*ltic knowingly and maliciously covered up one of the worst grooming rings in football history. That despicable club and their fans are like a cancer on football.\n\nAnd refuse to pay compensation to the boys involved.\n\nFans are happy with that as if they paid out any money it would effect how good they are on the pitch.\n\nIf the fans were really the moral upstanding people they think they are they would concentrate on holding their own club to account.\n\nI never understood remembrance until I listened to the hard-core histories podcast about ww1. Now I get quite emotional knowing it would have been me in those trenches. We should put our differences aside for these moments.\n\nThis isn‚Äôt about WW1, or even WW2. It‚Äôs about the actions of certain British soldiers during the Irish war of Independence and the troubles. Remembrance day has since come to include them, which doesn‚Äôt sit well in Ireland, or other areas where they committed atrocities. If it was to return to exclusively WW1 and WW2, there would not be the booing\n\n[removed]\n\nBritish*\n\nScotland was a very willing participant in the British Empire and colonialism, Glasgow was built from it and the East India Company was majority Scottish before nationalisation.\n\nBizarre. Their Grandparents died and I'm certain they wanted their families to carry this on.\n\nadmirable of celtic fans to take a stand against that strange bit of nationalist posturing\n\nIm not sure what happened in your life to make you think that remembering millions of dead people is either nationalist or strange.\n\nA lot of those unhappy with the remembrance/poppy featuring are those who have suffered at the hand of the British military - that includes the Irish. The poppy has been extended to include those felled in service of the armed forces, it doesn't just apply to ww1/ww2, so naturally there are plenty around with reason to be unhappy.\n\nNo, you clearly don't get it at all. There are so many reasons why an individual might not want to observe that silence, and if you take the time you could find out what a few of them are. \n\nObserving the silence is a choice that should be taken at an individual level not pushed by the state. If the position of the state is that the default position is to observe the silence, then it is entirely reasonable that a person might want to show dissent whether by booing or some other means.\n\nAlso you realise you can still be silent and remember the dead even if someone else is making noise? You don't need total silence to do that do you?\n\n[deleted]\n\nIs it really 'Nationalist posturing' to remember people who have died in war? What an utterly weird comment to make.\n\nThe majority of these people will never have been to Ireland and I'd doubt if many of them have Irish ancestry.\n\nCeltic fans revel in being offensive, the only thing they are better at is trying to remind the world about the Irish struggle. On the day of 07/10/2023 they played Kilmarnock, unfurling banners such as \"Victory to the resistance\" whilst at the same time Israelis were still being abducted, raped and murdered. \n\nWhy? Because you know Britain, Ireland. They are sycophants, everything in their being revolves around the Irish struggle and will support terrorism as long as it doesn't put them at a disadvantage (9/11). They have no morals and were never as \"politically offensive\" during the Irish struggles, it's an occupation for many of them now (pardon the pun)\n\nDo most Scottish people feel British as opposed to Scottish? Surprised to see the amount of outrage on twitter for Celtic doing what Celtic does. They've consistently been this way, and can you blame them? Like honestly, Let the People Sing\n\nKeep politics out of football ‚Äústick to politics‚Äù\n\nRemembrance is a personal statement. when you try and force a large group of people to partake, especially a group with legitimate grievances against the state,it's not going to go to plan. Remembrance Sunday seems to have turned into a combination of competitive solemnity and a celebration of militaristic force. It doesn't sit right with me anymore.\n\nhttps://thecelticstar.com/in-loving-memory-of-celtic-fanatic-thomas-kidso-reilly/\n\nDog whistling so  loud. Just like the Irish\n\n[removed]\n\nYou should see what the British army are considered all over the world\n\nCeltic fans, toxic fanbase. Look forward to the next generation of sectarianism violence. \n\n People saying they expected it to be Liverpool fans are an embarrassment. Yes they have a long standing anger towards conservative governments. The war though, they had family members who fought and died in the war just as much as any other area in the UK.  Liverpool was the most heavily bombed city outside of London in WW2!\n\nWhat if we just stop pandering and just played football.\n\nApparently WW2 was about Freedom and we wouldn't be free if we didn't win. If you express your freedom by booing though you're scum, makes sense eh?\nPoppies are a huge political machine now, when I was young it was focused on the 2 wars,.now the focus is on all military so I have issues with that. Firstly, as a govt who has sent these people to war and at times illegally, you should be paying for them. Secondly it has now morphed into a quasi military fetish with goons dressed up and laying wreaths despite being convicted criminals and some having actual swastika tattoos FFS.\nThis isnt the USA yet but there are elements of it's military love in creeping into society. The easiest solution, all the flag shaggers and poppy enthusiasts enlist and serve in the military. The \" lest we forget \" statement wrecks me. We have forgotten as we still send men to war in the whim of billionaires and we have forgotten the biggest victory of the second world war, the NHS . The vast majority of men serving in WW2 votes for labour and the implementation of the NHS, now we have scummy politicians saying these words but at the same time dismantling the very service they  voted for. It's another version if \" they're trying to cancel Christmas\" . FFS get a hobby and stop reading newspapers owned by billionaires who do y live here or pay tax\n\n&gt;Minute's silence forced to end as Irish people don't like the British\n\nFTFY\n\nWho the hell thought it would be a good idea to have a minute silence for Remembrance Day at a Celtic game üòÇ\n\nPeople saying Remembrance Day was ‚Äúextended into everything including British Soldiers‚Äù it was always my understanding that Remembrance was for ALL soldiers who die as a result of war and its consequences, it‚Äôs about hoping for the ideal where nothing should ever arise that necessitates the need for arms.\n\nI mean we celebrate it on the day of the armistice, and that didn‚Äôt just involve us. Obviously each nation probably focuses more so on their own soldiers, which is understandable, but the minute‚Äôs silence has always been a universal sign of respect.\n\nKeep politics out of football plz\n\nFootball and sport is inherently political"

This is why humanity is cooking itself\n\nAre you trying to say that Spanish people aren‚Äôt white? Lol\n\nWow who would've thought Spain has racism /s\n\nDon't condemn the racist insults, condemn the racists.\n\nI wish i can upvote this comment more than once. Condemn the racists\n\nOr both?\n\nYoungest player ever to experience spanish fan racism\n\nHope the club really cooperated and there are consequences for that people.\n\nSad but unsurprising. Like they say, racism is a double-edged sword.\n\nCan you elaborate ?\n\nIf it can affect a minority, it will. Racism doesn't really acknowledge degrees of \"badness\". If racists hate black players from Real, they also most likely hate black players from Barcelona. Racism is a double edged sword. It hits the Barcelona and the Real, the rich and the poor, the blue and white collars.\n\nI feel like that metaphor isn‚Äôt correct, I thought double edged sword implied one good and one bad effect\n\nUsually means it \"cuts both ways\".  Can hurt you as often as hurt the other. But I can see its meaning evolving or being used slightly differently.\n\nWell, in this context it means \"equally terrible\" for both sides.\n\nWrong\n\nthat's not how it works though\n\nAre you inventor of english language\n\nIt‚Äôs not a football problem, it‚Äôs a Spanish society problem‚Ä¶we just hear about it happening in a stadium cause cameras are there, but Spanish people really need to get their shit together as a whole\n\nA Spanish and Italian thing, if yer just talking about the major European leagues.\n\nThat said, just look at what happened after the England Euros penalty loss to Italy - England fans going full 1700s racist against their own players.\n\nIt's worth pointing out that the majority of the abuse came from accounts outside of the Uk\n\nEngland fans =/= English people in this case\n\nI still remember when Spanish fans went to the 2008 Spanish GP in blackface with shirts saying \"Hamilton Family\"\n\nAnd Alonso saying that Lewis should \"expect\" that behaviour!\n\nNot only Spain, europeans are racist AF lol\n\nSuch copium from Americans whenever they say this lol. Europeans certainly have their problems with racism but we don‚Äôt generally go around killing black people for no reason.\n\nYeah I am not from the US, I am Colombian lol\n\nOh right, same statement applies anyway\n\nSo many fans can‚Äôt stand a black footballer player scoring and celebrating. Like get over yourself it‚Äôs fucking football\n\nThey can't, because deep down they are racist so when they get excited or mad (like it happens with many football fans) they show their true colors.¬†\nSome will show class, and others will show that they are some racists pieces of shit\n\nI see a lot of people here clashing because someone did something wrong, but the biggest win here is that the opposing team tries to fight racism. Be happy things are changing, slowly but surely.\n\nAlways funny when Madrid fans start being racist and then you look at their team.\n\nLmao\n\nMadrid fans trying not to be hip√≥crites  challenge = not possible\n\nsome dumb fucks are going to be punished. what did Barca do to punish \"death to Vinicius\" chants?\n\nHow childish. Let's not punish these low lives because nothing was done to the other group.\n\nIt's not racist, is it?\n\nJust some vini hate\n\nI mean hating someone isnt a punishable offence is it?\n\nEspecially vini but that statement feels overboard and funny at the same time like he's a dictator or something\n\nDo you see barca fans crying about the chants? \n\nThen you see Madrid fans asking Valencia and atleti to be relegated because of the exact same thing. I know reading comprehension isn‚Äôt one of your strongest qualities, but try to read again what i said and see if it makes sense\n\nwell maybe, just maybe, the people doing racist chants are not the same as the ones criticizing it. ever thought about that?\n\nYes I see tons of Barca fans crying about these chants? It‚Äôs all over X.\n\nYou‚Äôre not very bright are you?\n\nAre you stupid\n\nMake 3m play a few matches behind closed doors\n\nEven if Vinicius is an arrogant asshole, this does not give the right to anyone to hurl racist slurs against him\n\nSeason long stadium ban?\n\nWell, sadly is what has been happening for ages, nothing new that is targeting Vinicius. I hope now la Liga has the guts to punish Real Madrid the same way they have done to other teams.\n\nHe plays superbly in the el classico\n\nSpain racist. News at 11.\n\nSurprise?  Spanish people are 90% racists\n\nHappy to see that the club reacted quickly.\n\n\nFuck every single racist out there, regardless of that club they support or who they decide to insult. Fuck them\n\nRacists are fucking morons, racially abusing a child is a whole new level of low! I'd honestly advocate for the death penalty.\n\nYeah let's kill them all!!!!!!  WAAAAAGH\n\nBLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD\n\nSKULLS FOR THE SKULL THRONE!\n\nThey do it to vini, i don't see why they don't do it to yamal too. Heck you can even put usain bolt on la liga and he'll get bashed too\n\nThe differnece between yamal, bolt and vini is that vini is an annoying piece of shit and an asshole\n\nNah bro I‚Äôm really fighting anybody that talks bad about this kid, 1v5000 idgaf I‚Äôm going down swinging for him. Protect him at all costs. He just might become the closest thing to Messi we will ever see.\n\nAs they wipe the crocodile tears away.\n\nOh good, they condemned it. That will surely help prevent it. üôÑ\n\nHeres to everyone using Yamal perfromance as a justification to be raciat towards Vini. They really think it's only because he is shithouse in the pitch, he deserves to be targeted. Yamal and Raphinha were targeted to because surprise surprise Spain have a racism problem.\n\nImagine hating on one of The best talents in The world because you are mad that you lost\n\nCorrect me if I‚Äôm wrong here, but didn‚Äôt Barca fans chant like ‚ÄúVinicius die‚Äù or something? \n\nNot saying this isn‚Äôt bad but it goes both ways which is a tragic. Biggest sport in the world but it also comes with the biggest morons.\n\nValencia got punished last season, why should Madrid not be punished similarly now? I think we know why\n\nWow white people all over the world are racist. What a suprise.\n\nWhere is Vini now?\n\nCrying after that 4-0 loss. Vinicius is a cunt\n\nWhat's your response now that he has condemned the racists?\n\nClose this part of the stadium... Oh, wait!¬†\n\nDrunk soccer fans always shout something stupid to any kind of player. But it is always automatically racist if it is against a black player\n\nthe comments might have been ‚Äúfucking moor‚Äù and ‚Äúfucking negro‚Äù but you right that was definitely just drunk bros banter right\n\nYes, but why are these insults then worse than other personal insults ?\n\nYou don't see why calling someone fucking negro is worse than calling them a fucking idiot?\n\nThere are worse callings on the field than \"idiot\". People got made fun of because their child died, got homophobic slurs, etc. \n\nThese idiots will say anything to insult good players. I dont know why racists comments (which are horrible and stupid) seem for so many the worse of them all.\n\nFair point. The ones you mentioned are also clearly horrific.\nI guess given the western history of chattle slavery and everything since, othering someone that you used to enslave a few hundred years ago seems generally worse than most things. \nPeople were killed with these words and for these words. They're not just hurtful they have a lot of dark history behind them.\n\nIf the insult **is racist** then yes. Don't you think?\n\nHehehe he can still pick Morocco hehehe keep going.\n\nPretty sure he can't. I think the rules are less than three matches, none of which can be at a tournament.\n\n[removed]\n\nThere is bitching shouting shit and then there is racism. Big difference\n\n[removed]\n\n\"provoke the fans\" dude how fragile must your ego be if a simple shush makes you scream racial slurs. especially at a 17 year old.\n\nfound the racist\n\nYup, I was just about to write the same thing.\n\nThat's a lot of shit coming out of your fingers, isn't it?\n\nInsult the player if they deserve it (for the provoking), but DON'T BE RACIST. It isn't that hard don't you think?\n\nHow was that celebration disrespectful? Also vini literally taunts back to the crowd unlike Yamal who was mature enough to not respond back\n\n[deleted]\n\nThe video I saw is of him pointing to his number 19 and some of the crowd calling him slurs. Also the calma celebration isn't disrespectful enough to warrant racist slurs. No celebration is.\n\n[removed]\n\nHeld accountable for what, doing a celebration? Are you new to football? None of these so-called provocations should warrant racism. Why are you defending the crowd\n\nYou got humiliated at your home and now you're humiliating yourself with all this crying bro. Get over it.\n\n[deleted]\n\nOh, you're just taking shit then\n\nWhat did Yamal say about the situation? I didn't see a quote from him in the article.\n\nFine, call him a bitch. When you introduce racial elements into it, you deserve to be banned from football stadiums."

They‚Äôre like one of those gossip sites that claim every married Hollywood couple is splitting up, then when one of them does they plaster ‚Äòwe told you - five years ago we said they‚Äôd split!‚Äô Ignoring all the other claims they made which were clearly made up¬†\n\nGood thing they didn't buy him then and signed him as a free agent.\n\nHe had a signing fee of reportedly somewhere between ‚Ç¨100M-‚Ç¨150M. He's also on absurd wages of about ‚Ç¨600,000 a week. So hes basically going to cost them at least ‚Ç¨250M to ‚Ç¨300M throughout his 5 year contract. Its the sort of deal Barca had with Messi and that contributed a lot to their financial issues in the end. You gotta say it seems like way too much money for any club to put into 1 player. Even if it's Real Madrid its still a wince worthy amount of money they've had to put up to get that deal done. Still doubt Real regret it. He will pull them in quite a lot of money.\n\nBarca paying Messi that much I can understand. If Madrid does the same for Mbappe, it won't kill them yet. It's if they start buying ludicrous sums on the equivalent of Dembele, Coutinho, Griezmann and then signing aging stars like Vidal or overpay for guys for Paulinho. \n\nSo far Real have shown they will spend big but on the right guys like Bellingham. They won't be signing older players unless it's for a low sum or even free.\n\nPaulinho catching strays when he was a beast, and gave a net positive to Bar√ßa lmao\n\nLol but? They bought Eden for over 100 mil Euro\n...\n\nWhat's your point?\n\nNobody questioned that at the time. He was one of if not they best player in the world then. The fact he dropped off a cliff almost immediately was unforeseeable\n\nI still struggle to believe it.\n\nThe irony was that Eden actually wanted to do it right once he did join so he hit the gym harder to work off the weight he had gained over the summer. \n\nThen he got injured and things just spiralled out of hand. It didn't help that Real Madrid would have injury crises from then until 2021.\n\nLuka Jovic is doing wonders at Madrid right now too.x\n\nHi dear\n\nWith all the respect, Mbappe isn‚Äôt Messi, and that much money imo isn‚Äôt the same level of crazy investment justified (yet), Messi could hold the team alone in his hands in important matches, Mbappe isn‚Äôt yet that player, no hate.\n\nWhere was I saying Mbappe is Messi?\n\nOh wasn‚Äôt really directed to you. Was just a reflection\n\nOhhh I think I get the tone of what you were putting down now. Yeh I agree its a wild amount for Mbappe as he hasn't really proven himself close to the levels Messi had at the time. He's a top player but I think the current top players are a notch below what Ronaldo and Messi were doing in their equivalent years.\n\nLittle unfair for us to expect another ronaldo and messi to come directly after them. Its not normal for 2 generational players to play in the same era.\n\nNo expectations mentioned. I do think there are going to more consistently be generational players but not necessarily a GOAT contender in every generation. I mean players like Haaland, Palmer, Mbappe etc are the talents of the current generation so they're by definition generational. GOAT contenders are a bit above that.\n\nMessi made ‚Ç¨200m PER YEAR in his final years.\n\nheavy physical vase cough abounding degree steer ad hoc salt many\n\n *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev/home)*\n\nHis contract nearly bankrupted the club, there‚Äôs plenty of information available to read up on about those final years and what it led to.\n\nThat is completely bs, Messi was printing machine of money for the club, especially in titles he brought back in the field, what nearly bankrupted the club was the terrible transfer policy followed with insane contracts for those players.\n\n4 years after he left, Messi is still being paid by Barcelona. It is not BS. You have no clue what you are talking about. Messi is in fact one of the biggest culprits of Barcelona‚Äôs dire financial situation. He kept asking for renewals every two years, every time with higher wages. That made the club have difficulties in keeping and getting other players of a high calibre, which in turn led them to not win titles, and so on. Plus they were also paying Negreira a hefty yearly sum..\n\nAnd wasn't he demanding contracts for his buddies and wanting to have a say in picking the team.\n\nYes. He was. In picking the team and the coaches.\n\nYou mean the wages he was entitled and wasn't paid because of the President bankrupt the club with his transfer policy. How dare they.\n\nBecause the club couldn‚Äôt actually afford his wages and had to amortize the payments‚Ä¶\n\nand why did those players get insane contracts? because Messi lifted the roof so high that those numbers started sounding reasonable for other players\n\nThat is the president's fault. Messi was in the club since 2000, and he is literally the most successful and best player the club ever had consecutive renewals with pay increases over a 21-year period is normal.\n\nHe literally accepted a 50% pay cut the maximum that spanish law allows to stay at the club and Barcelona couldn't afford it because of the transfer policy they had.\n\nFootball is still a team game.\n\nIf Messinis on 800k a week or whatever, a Suarez is not going to claim he is worth the same but will probably start thinking 450k is more than reasonable.\n\nThen other players who play regularly look at that Suarez money and think hmm, why wouldn't we be on 300k a week.\n\nThis will spiral all the way down your club\n\nAnd is up the board to say no, and not spending 120 million on Griezmann per example.\n\nWas Messi making an absurd amount of money? No question. Was he bringing in a shit ton of money into the club? Also, yes. was Barcelona transfer policy absurd and nearly bankrupt the club, no question.\n\nIt is not normal to have contract renewals every 2 years.\n\nIt is when you're literally the best person on the planet on that field.\n\nI'm assuming, if you're accusing others of talking conplete BS, you have numbers to back that up?\n\nThey don‚Äôt because it is all made up in their mind.\n\nDo you have the numbers to back up? That was Messi's contract that nearly bankrupt the club?\n\nNope, but I'm not accusing anyone of talking complete BS.\n\nHis contract didn‚Äôt nearly bankrupt them, they have been poorly managed. They couldn‚Äôt even bring Messi back for free and still have trouble registering players 3 years after he left. They spent too much on transfer fees and wages for players who didn‚Äôt pan out. Real by comparison is very disciplined with spending.\n\nHe brought that revenue to Nike. Not Barca though?\n\nNike paid barca for the privilege of making their shirts\n\nyup, messi final 4 years earn 675 mil\n\nwtf but he wanted them and only them, how did real get swindled into paying that much???\n\nReal has been investing smart and have had far less wasted money and misses than anybody else. While improving their already obscene earnings. They're fine splashing on Mbappe\n\nLol his \"absurd\" wages are because of his signing fee, they are included in it. Which is worth it because of his sales alone, don't even have to mention that it would been ‚Ç¨200M to PSG plus those wages before. Also not sort of like Messi it would of been double.\n\nDamn, Mbappe trolling wherever he goes.\n\nI mean what was the total cost of signing hazard? 300 million? Nothing gained from it, no performance, no resale, literally burnt money. \n\nAnd they had several such transfers, not everything they do is perfect.\n\nJovic is another example, -100 million for nothing. \n\nJames Rodriguez also wasn‚Äôt really a lot better than the dembele transfer for Barca, only a bit cheaper.\n\n&gt;So hes basically going to cost them at least ‚Ç¨250M to ‚Ç¨300M throughout his 5 year contract\n\nWasn't Messi's ‚Ç¨555M over 4 years though? More than twice as much\n\nThat ‚Ç¨300M for Mbappe is actually quite a conservative estimate probably as it doesn't weigh in the bonuses and marketing rights which may send him even more money because we don't know exactly what his extras are. So I mean just in regards to salary it's a similar sort of deal which from what I remember Messi was on about ‚Ç¨650K-800K a week.\n\nApparently his base salary was 72M a year so almost ‚Ç¨1400k per week\n\n[Source](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/4224341/2021/01/31/barcelona-threaten-legal-action-over-lionel-messis-492m-contract-leak/#:~:text=What%20did%20the%20leaked%20documents,Messi%20signed%20was%20highly%20incentivised.)\n\nI'm aware of the signing on fee and such. But they still didn't \"buy\" him by paying a transfer fee. It's their own fault for paying so much, he really wanted Madrid so Madrid had a good hand to play. They should have offered him less money, he didn't have anywhere else he wanted to go and he didn't want to stay at PSG either.\n\nThere was absolutely nothing ‚Äúfree‚Äù about signing mbappe.\n\nBro thinks free agents work like FIFA üíÄ\n\nHappy to swap him with Joao Felix \n- Chelsea fans.\n\nGive us Palmer and yall can take Mbappe\n\nYou forgot the /s\n\nHe can't play 10\n\nThey will happily do so ü§£  Are u stupid?\n\nWhats up with the name calling are you 10? Bet you only watch the highlights and not the full games! Mbappe hasn‚Äôt played well at Real this season! He doesn‚Äôt fit it!\n\nHasnt played well and still has 10 GA, think about when he starts playing well stupid.\n\n3 pens!!! Gtfo!\n\nSo, half of Penmar's goals are from penalties. Fuck off dude. Wanting him in place of Mbappe is like wanting Ansu Fati in place of CR7 ü§£\n\nFactos üëç\n\nPeople's standards are insane, he's doing fine.\n\nPlus, he's been there for like a quarter of a season, Vini was a late bloomer and so was Benzema\n\nVini came in as a teenager though\n\nAnd Benzema came in a tee... wait, wrong sub.\n\nJesus Christ lol\n\nAmazing üòÇ\n\nlmfao Cheeky boy\n\nüíÄ\n\nVini's not a late bloomer. He's still a kid\n\n24 yo kid\n\nYeah that's a kid. It's ridiculous to call him a late bloomer when he's in contention for Balon d'or aged 24\n\nJust shows how insane Ronaldo was.\n\nYeah, people are making up a narrative at the moment. Maybe they actually want to see him flop. Maybe they like kicking drama. I don't know. Real isn't doing that great at the moment, but it can barely be (majorly) attributed to Mbappe. The back is hurt with many injuries, the midfield is missing Kroos, Carvajal who's become a dominant person in the squad is out, and Ancelotti is still puzzling with what he has got. But I guess making it about the biggest signing of the summer that has been anticipated for years is an easy and effective way to generate buzz.\n\nmedia definitely want to see him fail, drama grts the most cliks\n\nBS üòÇüòÇüòÇ EVERY club would kill to have him in their squad\n\nMight have to kill to afford him too\n\nThe petro-clubs are like: no problem\n\nIf you actually watched him in his Real games, you‚Äôd revise that statement. His main skill is to run fast and an awesome strike. But his ball reception and handling in slow 1:1s is mid. The amount of times he loses the ball, ridiculous. Plus he doesn‚Äôt work as much in defense as the rest of the team. Screws up team spirit. \n\nHe was the hero in PSG, but in Real he‚Äôs just one of a lot good players.\n\nLol ok\n\nI don‚Äôt find that as outrageous as people are implying tbh. They needed a Benzema replacement, and still do. The rumbling always felt like that was meant to be Haaland eventually. I‚Äôm still not sure what the plan is with mbappe. He likes to occupy the same spaces as vini. Mbappe definitely felt like a Perez signing above all else.\n\nmaybe the word regret is hyperbole tho\n\nRidiculous. He still has the potential to be one of the greatest of all time. You don‚Äôt pass up on the opportunity to sign a player like him\n\nNot to mention he scored today. That's 6 goals in 9 appearances.\n\nIt's kinda funny this is considered a slow start by so many people. Especially when his early matches were where he struggled the most.\n\nTake out the penalty goals and it's a different story.\n\nPeople making it looks like he is balling when he scored 3 penalties out of 6 goals.\n\nSo he instantly became the biggest club in the world‚Äôs undisputed #1 penalty taker and has dispatched every single penalty he‚Äôs taken? In what world would that count against him?\n\nTop n9 have a 90% success rate with pens. So nothing surprising he scored three out of three.\n\nBut saying 6 goals in 9 games is a good performance is wrong when half of these goals are penalties.\n\nAnd if you buy a top notch goalkeeper you‚Äôll pay more than 200M for 5y I expect him to start and be the main guy there. Expect the same from a winger or striker with that situation.\n\nHis performance for RM is just ok in my opinion for now.\n\nScoring penalties is incredibly hard, this perception that they shouldn‚Äôt count as actual goals is nonsensical\n\n90%+ score rate on most top penalty kick takers suggest it's not incredibly hard. If he scored 2 out 3, it would be a failure.\n\nYes a penalty in a World Cup final is a ton of pressure and become harder like a free throw during the last seconds of the 7th game of NBA finals. The rest of the time it‚Äôs something they could almost do with closed eyes.\n\nThat‚Äôs like lukewarm-IQ analysis of football lmao\n\n3 penalties...\n\n\"hold my beer\" - Lewa\n\nHahah okay sure\n\nFlorentino Perez is Real Madrid!\n\nOpec type bot on this\n\nPSG very salty still\n\nRomain Molina is a lot of things but pro psg or on nasser‚Äôs payroll isn‚Äôt one of them lol. I don‚Äôt really believe this either since we‚Äôre just in October but it‚Äôs pretty obvious Perez was the one who was pushing to sign him\n\n\"Perez was the one who was pushing to sign him\" - every club / director / president would want to sign mbappe. Only reason we didn't see a bidding war was because mbappe made it pretty clear he would only go to Madrid once he leave psg.\n\nObviously a lot of clubs would want Mbappe that‚Äôs not the point. The point is Perez was the one insisting on trying to sign him for 3 years despite not really being a profile they needed. Do you really think ancelotti and real actually needed another left winger?\n\nDo you think ancelotti didn't want to sign mbappe?\n\nI don‚Äôt think any coach would refuse Mbappe, but no I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a player he needed. They clearly need a striker and Mbappe isn‚Äôt a good striker. I think it‚Äôs pretty obvious watching real that he hasn‚Äôt figured out how to use him yet and if you‚Äôre a coach like ancelotti why would you want a player on a gigantic salary that you have no idea how to fit in your system that won you the UCL and la Liga last year?\n\nDude, it's just the start of season with kroos the anchor of midfield retiring. New system/ new league. Multiple injury set backs across the team. U think ancelotti regrets signing mbappe today based on how 10 games have gone? In which we have already won a trophy and he has scored 6 goals. Yes the start hasn't been ideal but u r just makin up arguments.  Only thing that would put a doubt on this is if Halaand was on the market and we still went for mbappe. Even in that case it's a 50-50 decision.\n\nAncelotti doesnt ‚Äúregret‚Äù since he‚Äôs not the one who signed him. That‚Äôs the entire point. Obviously losing Kroos is a big deal but look at how Bellingham is being used this season. He has much less impact since he has to work overtime to cover for Mbapp√©‚Äôs laziness when Bellingham was one of your most important players last season. Ancelotti is forced to mess with aspects of his team that worked well to try to fit Mbappe in. That‚Äôs not something you have to do if it‚Äôs someone you absolutely wanted. \n\nLet me ask you this, if you remove Mbappe from this squad do you believe it‚Äôs significantly weakened? I doubt it, it‚Äôs the same squad that got you UCL+Liga last season with an extra endrick and guler who hopefully stays injury free this season. \n\nNow imagine if Madrid had not signed Mbappe this season but instead signed Kane last season and a midfielder this summer to replace (at least numerically, not qualitatively) kroos, do you think they‚Äôd be better worse off than they are today? I think it‚Äôs obvious they‚Äôd be better off, especially since having someone like Kane ahead of him would be ideal for endrick‚Äôs development\n\nGlad someone sees the bigger picture!! I‚Äôve tried to explain that to my fellow madridistas and most of them have shitted on me because they believe he needs time to adapt! When I told them that this squad didn‚Äôt need him when you already had Vini as the main man along with Jude!! It sucks to see the team play so bad! We are waiting for a rude awakening once we play one of the stronger teams\n\nAnd all of that is made worse by the fact you‚Äôre signing him at a pretty low point in his career so you‚Äôre not even getting the best version of him. If anything it‚Äôs getting even worse now after he ditched the international break\n\nStop embarrassing yourself u/dunphyisms\n\nPiss off!\n\nYes. His signing created imbalance in the squad. I‚Äôm sure Ancelotti would‚Äôve preferred signing someone for other positions.\n\nAnd Molina also is one the few sports journalist that really goes for investigations. He did deep stories on really fucked up things, for instance in Africa and Ha√Øti, some of them ended up with indictments and people being suspended. The guy has networks.\n\nAnd indeed regarding PSG, he's the only one pushing forward how everything is fucked up in the club, with a former chauffeur being pretty much in charge of everything and using shady technics. He's definitely not on Naser's guest list...\n\nHe digs deep in his investigative stories made in cooperation with big news outlet (I think he worked with The Guardian on the Haiti story), but in his regular videos he comes off (at least to me) as kind of a \"trust me bro\" merchant. He's made a lot of claims in those videos where he either says \"I've been told/I know\", or that he has proof but barely ever discloses said proofs.\n\nAnd wasn't he completely wrong on the Hamraoui case? I think he was fed something by a source and he just repeated it without making sure it was true before. And a journalist who just repeats what he's being told without cross-checking before is a gold mine for anybody who wants to push a narrative. \n\nI'd trust his published papers, but take whatever he says on YT or his social media with a grain of salt.\n\nGoal.com in BIG 2024 almost 2025. Let that platform go.¬†\n\nMbappe is useless, if Madrid were already winning everything in sight without his toxic influence on the team, why rock the boat and bring him in? Regret is the right word. It‚Äôs really sad, Madrid used to be such a good team\n\nI doubt it. For starters they didn't ‚Ä≥buy him‚Ä≥. The signing on fee and wages may be way higher than normal, but I bet the merchandise sales are also way higher than normal too.\n\nThey also have the option of selling him if they're that unhappy with him. May not be able to get the full amount they'd like from him, but should still able to make a profit from it overall.\n\nFree transfer and they are paying in instalments for him and to him.\n\nRemember when Madrid said haaland wouldn‚Äôt get into their first team üòÇ\n\nWell that's a lie\n\nDoubt, he's scoring, in his prime and he's been there for 3 months lol\n\nWho tf believes in these articles in 2024ü§£ü§£\n\nAnd then he scores the best goal of the season so far ü§£ You can not make this up.\n\nSource: trust me bro\n\nNo they're not.\n\nWhen the clickbait title is so stupid it guarantees you‚Äôre not going to read the article‚Ä¶\n\nprobably because of the allegations; why they're still playing him is bit odd.\n\nI'll take \"Things a 7-year-old can make up\" for $500.\n\nWho is this journalist? Does he have good reputation?\n\nPretty much if your an outside observer yeah. He's one of the few sports journalist that investigates. He did deep stories on fucked up things happening in football around the world, often leading to investigations and sometimes people being indicted or suspended. He's also the only one that explains, for instance, how PSG is fucked up and uses shady technics. He's definitely not on Naser's payroll as some are claiming here, he's more on his target list.\n\nbro, being a sports \"journalist\" is the easiest fucking thing, just make up any claim about any footballer and earn a few cents for your article.\n\nDon't know about that but Mbappe has been the weakest link of Madrid. Extremely poor finishing, very little game awareness, ball control hasn't been even at par. Been playing like a fast 80 rated center forward. Madrid was much better without him for sure.\n\nHe's a cancer in the dressing room. You'll see soon enough.\n\nyeah, because madrid doesn‚Äôt know how to deal with multiple of the biggest superstars in the same room. they haven‚Äôt been doing it successfully for decades or anything\n\nBecause Neymar and Nasser told you so?\n\nInteresting, were you the kit man of PSG or France nation team?\n\nWhat are you doing in reddit Nasser?\n\nSo did Real get mtrapped? üòÅ\n\nyeah sure they are, gutted for getting the best player in the world for free makes total sense üôèüèª\n\nHe‚Äôs not even the best player in Madrid\n\nbuggin\n\nHe hasn't been the best for a couple of months\n\nNeither Madrid nor Sweden are glad about him.\n\n[removed]\n\nWhat are you smoking ?\n\nI had a dream last night where Mbappe x Haaland x Lamine were playing for Barca. Luckily didn‚Äôt wet myself.\n\nFraud watch\n\nHe's the best player in the world , playing out of position, scoring 6 in 9. . What are you idiots talking about ?!\n\n3 pens, 3GA for ‚Äúthe best in the world‚Äù in 9 games isn‚Äôt that good lol\n\nPenbappe"

    "all_comment_text": "Forest must be the only team to have won the EC/CL more than they have won their domestic league?\n\nYou‚Äôre right. Forest have only won one English league title. They then qualified for the European Cup as a result and won it. The year after they qualified as defending champions and won it again. Every other winner and runner up has won more league titles than European Cups.\n\nI'd love to know if there's any other club around the world who has this distinction, since no others in Europe do! I've tried looking it up but I couldn't find anything conclusive \n\nAlso, I think it's worth mentioning sevilla, who have a similar distinction - they actually have more European trophies overall, then Spanish National level trophies - forest do have more domestic trophies than European ones overall, their distinction is being European champions more often then English champions\n\n&gt;I'd love to know if there's any other club around the world who has this distinction, since no others in Europe do! I've tried looking it up but I couldn't find anything conclusive\n\nThere's Gr√™mio, in Brazil. They have 3 Libertadores and 2 Brazilian Championships. They're the only team in South America to have won more Libertadores than their domestic league\n\nHoly shit you're right! Amazing catch, thanks! I know that the Brazilian national league has had a turbulent past with some truly insane formats that only settled into a more traditional, stable structure like most leagues have a few decades ago, and that state championships have always been very important there even to this day I think... and even so, as you say Gremio are still the only club with that superior ratio of being continental champions to national champions \n\nI love this stuff man, thanks üòÉ Gremio are where R9 Ronaldo started, right? Or was it Ronaldinho? And I know Luis Suarez played there recently too. Mental\n\nEstudiantes (Argentina) was a case for a while too but now they have more league titles (5) than Libertadores (4).\n\nSevilla has Just one spanish Championship and 5 Europe League 2 UEFA Cup Titles\n\nInteresting distinction of the only team to win it 2 years after promotion (fastest way possible), and only former winner to be relegated to 3rd tier of domestic league.\n\nI knew a few former winners had been relegated since winning it - hamburg, Aston villa, and even man united in the 70s (not sure if I've missed any), but I didn't realise forest were the only ones to then drop to the third tier! At least they're back in the big time now, hamburg are still in bundesliga 2 I believe.\n\nAnd when Forest played Villa in the Championship it was the first time that two former European Champions played each other in the 2nd tier...\n\nHaha, that's truly insane \n\n'Champions of Europe, you'll never sing that... oh wait never mind'\n\n&gt;the only team to win it 2 years after promotion (fastest way possible)\n\nFastest way possible back then, you can do it differently these days, you don't even have to be in the top flight to win it\n\nThe fact that Madrid is almost NEVER a runner up is insane to me.\n\nReal Madrid in a European final is the closest you can get in football to a final boss\n\nYou could argue for Sevilla in the UEFA cup/Europa league, 7 finals and 7 wins, and more then twice as many triumphs as any other club in that tournament's history\n\nReal are the undisputed final boss in the big one of course\n\nReal is the final boss in New Game Plus.\n\n85% winrate in finals and post 1990 100%. We have a near guarantee victory in finals, although dortmund could ruin the stat\n\ni hope we do!\n\n[removed]\n\nyeah i stayed up till 3am to watch the match and we lost 2-0. it was very disappointing\n\nOpposite of Juventus, who‚Äôve lost 7 finals and won 2.\n\nLast time it happened was in 81\n\nThe last time Real Madrid lost a European final was in 1983 (Cup Winners Cup Final). They lost to Aberdeen, who were managed at the time by Sir Alex Ferguson.\n\nAnd then there is Juventus who seem to almost lose each time¬†\n\nDamn Ajax and Bayern did a 3 peat each\n\nBayern‚Äôs ‚Äò75 win was controversial to say the least.\n\nwhat happened?\n\nLeeds got a lot of calls made against them the whole match\n\nAnd wasn't the referee eventually banned from football for taking part in match fixing?\n\nYou should see the penalty that was given to Juventus in 1985 to win it. Shocking decision.\n\nLots of this stuff happened back in the day. Inter Milan in the 60's too\n\nAnd Celtic still overcame them. Yassss!!!\n\nYeah but fuck Revvie\n\nsame as '76. square posts\n\nYep. Because of that, Ajax, Bayern and Real Madrid are the only clubs that have a genuine UCL trophy.\n\nyou get one when you win your fifth cup as well, so a few other clubs have real ones bc of that\n\nYeah a big thing about when we won in '05 was it, it's 'ours for keeps'\n\ni held that trophy when i was a kid on a tour of anfield, incredible experience\n\nWe should've had one of those then if Juve didn't cheat in 96\n\nIf you got one from a three peat, does the fifth win get you another real trophy or does it reset and the 4th win is back to 1.\n\nCheatventus\n\n I think Liverpool have one too after Istanbul, think it was because they changed thevp trophy so we got to keep the old one or something\n\nMilan too\n\n[deleted]\n\n3 consecutive and 5 wins overall are the ways you get to keep it, I believe.\n\nLeeds got robbed in 75 tbh\n\n1997/98 is the first time the competition actually become credible by adding more quality teams from the strong association. \n\nBefore 1997 it was a joke. Usually the Italian serie A and English league were much harder. There were barely 3 or 4 strong teams in the European cup. Thank goodness breakup of Russia and Yugoslavia helped to streamline the competition \n\n1999/00 was the actual time the competition became champions league with proper scrutiny before a team can lift the trophy. \n\nSo Messi Barcelona and cr7 3peat are the most impressive feats in this sport overall.\n\nThis has to be a troll üòÇüòÇüòÇ\n\nThis guy out here writing fables\n\n[deleted]\n\nEnglish teams were doing very well in the weak competition. 11 continuous euro cup finals and 7 victors. \n\nHeysel disaster was heart wrenching. And English holligans were destroying the sport. \n\nBut I feel the 5 years ban of English teams were political. The ban not only made the competition less competitive but also immensely helped Italian league and their national team. Eventually the law of averages caught up and heysel disaster ban had some magical effects for the English league. \n\nMost clubs went through a massive stadium refit and now suddenly English teams were featuring very clean and new looking stadiums and very organized seating. Imagine you watch on tv from foreign land and all teams have new nicely coloured chairs. I need to read if there was any tourism effect of it. \n\nEnglish teams were deprived of European cup /uefa cup income. But then the tv deal in 1992 was massive and the teams made the right decision to walk out of FA (with the risk a risk of formal ban) and form English premier league. The teams shared tv money democratically and who even thought this can have a massive effect on the whole league and health of clubs . Post millennium ,English teams again had the tight grip in the competition and making it more fun than ever.\n\nI disagree with most of the subjective aspects of your post. English football has provided a much worse experience for fans since the creation of the premier league. Matching plastic seats and tourists are in no way desirable. Endless group games with the same old opposition are incredibly dull compared to two-legged knockout ties against some unknown quantity from a far flung corner of the continent. \n\nFrom a factual perspective, it was the Hillsborough disaster and the subsequent Taylor Report that led to stadia being refurbished.\n\nHeysel disaster ,hillsborogh disaster ,Taylor report all had a few common points. Counter football hooliganism. Increase organisation and safety and orderliness. Crowd control and improved accounting. Reduction of crime and more beautiful stadiums means humongous marketting opportunity. \n\nI have watched Bayern Munich old stadium and and Lazio matches . Such poor ugly Olympic stadiums with running circuit. \n\nWhen you have the luxury you failed to see it. Here in singapore and asia, we mostly had bench stadium only. Both our sport and infrastructure sucks. So we know the quality and appeal of epl\n\nStill linking Hillsborough to hooliganism is asinine. Hillsborough is when people finally realized that supporters were in fact human beings that deserve proper safety, both in the stadium and in the way they were treated and discussed.\n\nInter Milan gotta have one of the most interesting histories here:\n\n\n‚Ä¢Perform back to back wins in the 60s, one win coming against Real Madrid.\n\n\n\n‚Ä¢Lose to Celtic‚Äôs famous Lisbon Lions team in 1967.\n\n\n\n‚Ä¢Lose to Ajax in 1972 in Rotterdam. \n\n\n\n‚Ä¢Wait over 30 years to make another final and win not only the trophy but achieve a treble.\n\n\n\n‚Ä¢Wait another 13 years to make a final to lose to Man City to then allow them to achieve a treble.\n\nThose goals by Milito are some of the greatest composure I have ever seen\n\nIt is *the* example of the best players performing in the biggest moments on the biggest stage.\n\nin all 3 crucial matches nonetheless! winning goals in UCL final, winning goal on last matchday of Serie A, and winning goal in the final of the Coppa Italia. But he was on fire the whole season\n\nThat‚Äôs why they call it ‚ÄúPazza Inter‚Äù (Crazy Inter). Just a rollercoaster of emotions for their fans.\n\nThose Celtic and Ajax losses lead to the first and second European trebles as well, the only one out of Ajax‚Äô four wins and 2 out of the 4 in the 20th century, along PSV and ManU\n\nInter's link to The Treble is really insane \n\n- 1964 and 1965 - Real Madrid and Benfica who they beat in those finals both went on to win their national titles and were both still in their national cups at the time of those European cup finals; they'd go on to get knocked out of their cups, but until inter beat them they were both fairly close to Trebles (saw someone post about this before last year's final) \n- 1967 - Celtic beat them 2-1 in Lisbon to become the first European club, and only Scottish club to date, to complete The Treble; they also won the league cup and Glasgow cup, all with a team of locals;\n- 1972 - Ajax beats them 2-0 to complete their first Treble;\n- 2010 - Inter beat chelsea in the last 16, who would go on to win their first double in England (sorry, I have to mention them too) and then met Bayern in a guaranteed Treblemaker final - both clubs had already won the double domestically! Inter would win 2-0 at the Bernabeu and become the only Italian club to win The Treble (in the 14 years sinve then, Bayern finished second in all three competitions in 2012(a Neverkusen they call it), and then Won *Two* Trebles themselves, insanely)\n- 2023 - losing to City contributed to their first Treble this time last year. \n\nMental\n\nGot to show some love for Steau Bucharest, more European trophies than Arsenal\n\nMore European cups, not European trophies\n\nI mean they have two European trophies each butbm Steaua's are more impressive to be honest.\n\nFind it mad for how big Man U are, they‚Äôve only ever been in 5 finals.\n\nMunich saw for the late fifties &amp; early sixties, relegation saw for the 70s, not winning the title and the European ban saw for the 80s, and the Glazers strangled the club in later years. You could probably argue there should have been more appearances between 1999 and 2013 but 4 out of 14 isn't *terrible.*\n\nAlso ran into Peps Barca in 2009 and 2011, any other team and I feel we'd of won those two finals\n\nIf chelsea hadn't experienced the fucking disgrace in 2009 and gone for a rematch with United, I think they would have thrown the proverbial kitchen sink, and I think we would have won that final. We'll never know of course!\n\nNot Mourinho counter attacking Madrid\n\nDon't remember mourinhos Madrid in a cl final\n\nThe European ban had nothing to do with it lol\n\n[deleted]\n\nThey didn‚Äôt win the league during the ban lol so wouldn‚Äôt have qualified to play in the competition would they?\n\n[deleted]\n\nThanks,Everton should feel the most aggrieved they would have had a great chance to win a European cup,such a good side under Howard Kendall\n\n[deleted]\n\nWhilst that‚Äôs true, they were still huge. Just because they had a down period in the 70s doesn‚Äôt mean they were nobodies. This is the club of Best, Charlton, Law and Edwards.\n\nI think the first one plays a huge role in setting the tone for the iconography of the club since it was a decade after the Munich Air Disaster. 2nd one was just so unlikely and we were not favourites only to go and win the treble and the 3rd one set Ronaldo up for the success he had in subsequent years.\n\nYou could argue they were fortunate to win the last two. Bayern should never have lost and John Terry slipped over. The two Barca games they got battered really.\n\nI find it amazing that so many United fans can claim that SAF is the undisputed goat despite never having the best team in the world, while managing the so-called biggest team in the world.\n\n[deleted]\n\nDebatable. Paisley actually dominated Europe.\n\n6 league titles and 3 European cups in 9 years. Ferguson never had a 9 year period like that.\n\nIt‚Äôs not debatable lmao 13 league titles vs 6 go sit down somewhere üòÇüòÇ\n\n13 in 27 years vs 6 in 9. Paisley was way more dominant in the time he was here.\n\nIt‚Äôs not sir Alex fault he had longevity Liverpool have 1 title in over 30 years assuming paisely would just keep winning leagues is dumb imo\n\nüòÜ what mumbo jumbo is this? What does Liverpool having 1 title in 30 years have to do with Paisley? Absolutely insane thing to say in favour of Ferguson over Paisley.\n\nAt the end of the day fergie is the goat no manager will ever come close to 13 league titles in the best league in the world 3 champions leagues is great but zidane did it in a row pep has 3 ancelotti has 4 so it‚Äôs not unheard of 13 prems as a manager will never be duplicated\n\nMan U kind of has a lackluster European portfolio compared to other giant teams; Real, Liverpool, Bayern, Barca, Milan, Ajax and Inter can all be considered bigger than Man Utd in European football(I know they have the same number of UCL as Inter, but Inter has more Uefa/Europa leagues and more european finals). That's why I find it ridiculous when Man Utd fans claim they're as big as Madrid.\n\nI don't think any united fan has claimed we're as successful as madrid, although maybe they were referencing commercial success/number of fans?\n\nI always can't believe SAF has only 2 champions league title, the same number that Pep Guardiola won in his first 3 years as a manager (yes I know he has a great Barca team before anyone feels the need to remind me of that)\n\nFuck, I am old. I have seen more than half of the finals.\n\nDamn you must be like, at least 20.\n\nFootball banter is over if Spurs and Arsenal ever win the UCL\n\nEveryone in 2019: *phew*\n\nReal Madrid have only lost 2 of 17 of these finals. People never talk about this stat and how insane it is. I mean just look at how many finals Juventus has lost\n\nThey actually lost three finals, Benfica, Inter and Liverpool.\n\n8-0 in the final since 1997. Amazing.\n\n3 of 18 but your point stands\n\n3 of 17 lol... today is their 18th final\n\nEdit - and now it's 3 of 18 lol. Ridiculous. How they keep succeeding at the highest level, absolutely remarkable. The most elite winning culture.\n\nThey‚Äôre also in 38 Quarters and 34 Semi. Behind them are Bayern 21, Barca 16 and Milan 13. It shows how consistent they are\n\nPeople never talk how they got big in the first place either. \n\nWithout dictatorship sponsorship (and bribery) Real would be just another Luton Town club.\n\nThe magic franco that bailed out the catalan club 3 times and \"let\" his club lose a lot of titles throughout his reign. For madrid being sponsored he sure was a shit one\n\nIt‚Äôs funny how during the years of the dictatorship Real Madrid won less national titles than on the years of democracy. I guess that Franco hold all the power in Europe to give Madrid European Cups but didn‚Äôt have enough power in Spain to give them as much titles‚Ä¶\n\nThe famous anti Madrid copypasta with no facts backing and some halve truth that people take as face value.\n\nThe amount of distinct winners and runners up going back pre millennium, particularly those who aren‚Äôt as ‚Äòbig‚Äô now, is so great.\n\nIt‚Äôs such a shame that the massive influx of cash has snowballed the big teams into a position where we now have a UCL where in almost every tournament only 6-7 teams have a reasonable chance of winning\n\nThe fact we have to go back half a fucking century to find the last time a team other than Real Madrid won three times in a row is nuts.\n\nThe format change of the champions league era, allowing multiple clubs from the biggest leagues to compete each season, made it more difficult to win multiple titles in a row- you still see clubs reaching multiple finals in a row and/or in several year periods and winning multiple titles in those periods, little stop-start dynasties, but to actually win and dominate in an unbroken chain is almost impossible nowadays with so many superclubs throwing everything at it\n\nAC Milan destroyed Benfica 3 in a row win and latter beat us again. Come on ü§å\n\nBe interesting to see the money spent on player salaries over the years from the start up to now\n\nBayern paid off the ref in 74-75.\n\n1967. True immortality\n\nRM 14/17 finals potentially 15/18. They basically own this cup\n\nintresting how bayern and real never faced each other in the final\n\nI think I saw a stat that it is the most played match up in this competition, and yet never met in the final as you say\n\nReal Madrid winning 5 in the last 10 years.\n\n\nUEFA Farmers League.¬†\n\nFU Guttman\n\nGuttman is certainly the most wronged person in Benfica  history \n\nThe curse doesn't exist, it was created by A Bola in the 70's or 80's, Guttman remained a Benfica fan until the end, he kept close contact with the players and always wished Benfica good luck for the European finals and hoped for the 3rd, the curse was created due to a bad translation, Guttman gave an interview to an Austrian magazine saying that Benfica unfortunately wouldn't get the 3rd European cup at the time, it would take some work and a few changes but they'd get there, the Portuguese newspapers wrote the headlines with \"Benfica won't get the 3rd European cup\", and of course it's much easier to remember the headlines than the interview itself. Then they came up with the story that he supposedly left in 1962 in bad terms, ignoring that he said that he left in good terms, Benfica couldn't pay him the money he required, he left and said that he'd be happy to return some day, which happened in 1965, when he returned to Benfica\n\nHSV ones a mighty club - now completely forgotten.\n\nMan United only have 3 CL yet claim to be the biggest club in the world. Laughable!\n\nRomas only final in 83-84 led to their then captain, who like Totti was a one team player and from rome, to leave the club because of shame. \n\nAfter 10 years, on the day of the loss, Agostino Di Bartolomei took suicide.\n\nHe is remembered as a true Roman symbol and an icon for the club.\n\nSpanish twams never lose to the english teams\n\nYet they dont get the respect\n\nFrom 91-99 there were different winners every year.\n\nBosman ruling really killed European football. Without it, France Ligue 1 would be in the Big 4.\n\nWithout the Bosman rule Southamerican football would probably dominate like it use too.\n\nSouthamerican players playing in Europe probably have a second European nationality making them put of the foreign players limit\n\nIm french and i can tell you if french player stayed in Ligue 1 we would win every champion's league for 10 years straight lmao. Unfortunatly french football sucks\n\nBosman rule was in early 90s. What you have won in Europe before? Say thanks to the old colonies players to make your league above the average. Never a big 5 league, only big market league. Dont forget that. Maybe thats why the french hate the portuguese league. Its top 3 heavy, but they still will do better in Europe despite losing the Best players each season, even to you PSG. We have many more to come. But that is a debate about us and Netherlands.\n\nBefore Bosman ? The only Champions League...\n\nWhich team is the one who won in 82-83 (with Juve as runner up) ?\n\nHamburg\n\nThanks\n\nWeird to think of Nottingham Forest winning a major trophy at all, they haven‚Äôt been good in my lifetime.\n\nIt's interesting to see the pattern of countries that dominated between eras. England having clubs winning it for 6 consecutive years is something.\n\n9 different winners from 91 to 99\n\nThe period between 1967 and 1997 was the closest we got to world peace\n\nWhy doesn't this already have Real Madrid in 23-24?\n\n well the match hasn't been finalized yet\n\nBut we all know the result though\n\nF Juve\n\n1990-91 was a weird final\n\n1977-84, 7/8 european cup winning teams were english.\nEngland 1978 world cup: didn't qualify. 1982 world cup: didn't make the knockouts. How?\n\nThat question i already made hundreds of times. And im portuguese. I think the direct agressive crossing balls of the brits scared in Europe. No elegance at all, but efective. They are not even close the best clubs but won it that way. I honestly think why in national tem didnt work at least the european stages. Out Europe, it was logical that technique will prevail...¬†\n\nMadrid not winning it for 30 years and still remain record holders is insane.\n\nHow many Champions #BenficaLisbon lost, is just crazy‚Ä¶‚Ä¶\n\nInteresting that when english clubs where banned (1985). suddenly porto, steau, psv started winning the tournament. Everton could have been in that table. Were as good if not better than that super-Liverpool for periods of the 1980s\n\nBan or no Ban, you couldnt take on Porto 87 or Bayern 87.¬† Even Juventus 86. Or Milan or Benfica 90. The rest is a dubious \"what if\"...¬†\n\nWhy were they banned?\n\n[Heysel-disaster 1985](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heysel_Stadium_disaster)\n\nI didn't finish the article but why did UEFA feel the need to ban all English clubs instead of just banning Liverpool?\n\nThank you\n\nUTV   Beat what was practically the German national side\n\ndamn the last time madrid lost a final was in 81! lets see if dortmund can break that streak\n\n Add Dortmund for 23-24\n\nWe‚Äôll see later today. RM in a final is no PSG..\n\nOk Mrs Irma\n\nI hate when this graphic comes up because it makes me want to start headbutting the fucking wall! Howard Kendall's Everton against Burcharest in 86, Porto in 87 and PSV in 88? Do me a fucking favor.\n\nNo clue why you're getting downvoted for frustration.\n\nI have similar problem with Barcelona 2009.  Granted there's no guarantee we'd win it in the final but that cunt Overbo and (now proven) bought refs made it impossible to find out.\n\nI was really looking forward to that final and cursed Barca for ruining it. I was also excited for Der Klassiker this year and for a CityPool final in 2022 and Madrid ruined it both times; I hate Spanish teams so much man...\n\n&gt;I have similar problem with Barcelona 2009.  Granted there's no guarantee we'd win it in the final but that cunt Overbo and (now proven) bought refs made it impossible to find out.\n\nProven ? When ? I am just asking proof\n\n[deleted]\n\nWe won the League in 85 and 87 mate? And we were 2 points away from winning it 3 years straight! 1985 was our greatest ever team who at the time won the League earlier than any one ever and we also won the European Cup Winners Cup and got to the F.A Cup final. And this also in an era when English teams were dominating the European Cup Liverpool 4, Forest twice and Aston Villa won it, so i think we would have had a really good chance of at least winning 1 in that era.\n\nThis stat proves that Barca are not a big club. First UCL in 1992 after 36 years of this tournament existing and it takes them this long for a supposed \"historic, big club\" to win one. They may be the second biggest club in Spain, but are nowhere near as massive in Europe, much less with all their recent bottlejobs.\n\nI hate bar√ßa, but come on theyve won the second most in the 21st century of any club\n\nFranco set it up good. üëç\n\nWas Franco emperor of Europe back then?\n\nFound a salty Uefalona fan\n\nSalazar too\n\nMadrid winning 6 in dinosaur era must be spoken more of\n\nBlame the other teams who refused to play when it was based on invitation.\n\nSo your grandfather is a dinossaur?¬†\n\n1980s must have veen good times for now much smaller clubs than back then\n\nHope Juve win a title in 10 years, let's pray for that. Enough with this nonsence\n\nehm no, it's perfectly fine as it is\n\nIt‚Äôs Bayern Munich‚Ä¶ And then every else"

    "all_comment_text": "Someone inform the Pope.\n\nTwo more and Messi becomes a saint.\n\nMessi literally means messiah\n\nNah, it doesn't, it just looks similar. The surname Messi comes from Italian, as do many Argentinian surnames. It is derived from the italian word for Messenger.\n\nThe fact that it looks like the Spanish word for Messiah (mes√≠as) is coincidental. The word Messiah (and *mes√≠as)* come from the Hebrew word for \"Annointed\", via latin.\n\nSo Yamal is the messiah? A sort of John the Baptist/Jesus dynamic?\n\nIs the Messiah not a messenger of god?\n\nYes but the literal meaning means \"covered with oil\"(anointed) as a king(and the messiah would be a king) has to be anointed\n\nYes, but the word doesn't derive from that root, and nobody would usually claim that the surname \"messenger\" means Messiah. It's a coincidence.\n\nNo Angel Gabriel is the messenger of God. Jesus is God's son, or God himself depending on what religion you follow, being a messenger was just part of the bigger picture.\n\nfacebook messi üëÅÔ∏èüëÑüëÅÔ∏è\n\nnah, it comes from the german word \"messie\", which means  \"(compulsive) hoarder\". which makes sense, because a lot of argentinians have german heritage. /s\n\nWhy was Messi giving a random baby a bath?\n\nAt the time Bar√ßa ~~was sponsored by~~ was partnered with Unicef. These photos were taken for a charity calendar I think. \n\nThe Bar√ßa player would pose with kids who entered a lottery to be picked, and Lamine won the one for Messi.\n\nIt's utterly, ridiculously coincidental and makes me actually think we are living in a simulation, because... What are the odds????\n\nAlso. What is Messi's life, why does it have themes and plot-twists and narratively satisfying throughlines like a movie????\n\n*Edited to correct wrong info\n\n&gt;Bar√ßa was sponsored by Unicef\n\nBarca wasn't sponsored by Unicef. Barca pays an annual fee to Unicef to put their logo on their kit. Earlier when they didn't have any sponsor, Unicef used to be on the chest. Nowadays it's on the back\n\nYou're right! Sorry, I wrote this in a hurry and messed up. Thank you for the correction!\n\nRight? Dude‚Äôs literally living a fairy tale with all the story lines\n\nNah, not a simulation, some of Messi's dandruff fell into the water and Lamine Yamal absorbed it, now he's here.\n\nMeanwhile I just got the dandruff part of the deal\n\nHold up that was actually him? I was 100% sure it was a joke\n\nIndustry plant ü§î\n\nhe knew the baby would be a good baller and he was afraid he would win more ballon d'ors than him, so he tried to drown him.\n\n[deleted]\n\nIt's not a fact just because you put it in a Reddit comment. You need to provide a source for that conclusion.\n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7206gj5w28o.amp\n\nsorry, i don't trust porn sites.\n\n[deleted]\n\nNah I just don't accept unsupported facts from strangers on Reddit and tbh I thought it was weird you even expected us to.\n\n[deleted]\n\nFun fact: I don't give a fuck whether anyone gives a fuck. Get a life.\n\nDamn asking for a source has truly became a taboo act\n\nNah being an entitled condescending jerk became taboo. Dude acting like he is owed a detailed research paper from some reddit comment\n\nI just asked for him to evidence his statement. You lot on here are fucking odd.\n\nWelcome to 2024 Reddit, where people can't read or write properly and if they do somehow manage to work out what you've said they react like psychopaths.\n\nWho are you, random?\n\nWhat are you on about? I'm just saying some guy commenting something isn't proof, they need to back it up with evidence.\n\n[deleted]\n\nYou take it personally, while what he said crossed some peoples mind\n\nGet over yourself\n\n[Here.](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5625937/2024/07/09/the-athletic-fc-viral-photo-that-unites-messi-and-yamal-plus-is-idealism-dead/)\n\nHe gave him his super powers\n\nWhile still keeping his, smart man\n\nKinda like One for All from MHA. Now we just need to wait for photos of Maradona or Pele or Cryuff bathing Messi\n\nI'm really wondering whether I'm that big of a minority in not believing this. To me this has publicity stunt all over it...\n\n[removed]\n\nYeah, its pretty crazy. I thought maybe Yamine Lamal's parents were some famous footballers and got this shoot to happen, but nope, they were chosen randomly by UNICEF to produce a charity calendar in collaboration with Barcelona\n\nClearly Messi is Lamal‚Äôs papa\n\nThis type of coincidente happens all the time. A few years ago, someone recorded a video of Guardiola giving advice to a 13-year old ball boy, and that ball boy ended up becoming Micah Hamilton. We have photos of:  \n\n\n\\-  Kid Neymar with Robinho.  \n\n\n\\- Kid Rodrygo with Neymar.   \n\n\n\\- Kid Julian Alvarez with Messi.   \n\n\n\\- Kid Julian Alvarez with Higuain.   \n\n\n\\- Kid Patric Kluivert with Marco Van Basten.  \n\n\n\\- Kid Icardi with Maxi L√≥pez (Lmao, yes, this happened)  \n\n\n\\- Kid Harry Kane with David Beckham.   \n\n\n\\- Kid Steven Bergwijin with Messi.  \n\n\n\\- Kid Mbapp√© with Thierry Henry.   \n\n\nAnd the famous photo of Kid Mbapp√© with Cristiano Ronaldo.\n\nAlso that random video of 5 year old Modric as a little goat herder\n\nA lot of these happen because even when they're kids, they're already outstanding footballers. The baby one though is just a crazy coincidence.\n\nThe difference is that your examples aren‚Äôt rare at all. if you‚Äôre a talented kid and play in a youth academy chances are there are photos of you and a superstar. These superstars take a crazy amount of photos with kids over the course of their career. \n\nHarry Kane played for Ridgeway Rovers from age 6. Having a picture with David Beckham, the biggest name who played for them, doesn‚Äôt feel like a coincidence. \n\nDavid Beckham probably took thousands of pictures with talented kids one of them becoming a top footballer doesn‚Äôt seem statistically unlikely either.\n\nNow the greatest player of all time bathing one (i doubt he did this one a regular basis) randomly selected baby, which turns out to become arguably the best 16 year old the world has ever seen. That‚Äôs what i call a coincidence.\n\nThese aren‚Äôt quite the same . The other were of the age they were playing football  and met through  footballing . This is different as it wa just  a competition apparently  and lamine was 6 months old. There are other pictures of lamine with messi where he is older and playing ball which mroe in line with  other photos mentioned\n\nBill Clinton and JFK\n\nTeddy Roosevelt watching Lincoln‚Äôs funeral procession.\n\nIt was broadcast on Swedish TV and they said it was confirmed true. Take that as you will.\n\nthis did happen but yamal was one of many to have a picture like this\n\nRight but the chances of him getting paired up with Messi were 1/12 or however many Barca players were at the shoot.\n\nYeah there's something weird about this. Then again, it'd be even more weird to lie.\n\nIt would be weird, yet not unthinkable. Weirder things have been done for publicity.\n\nIt's just that big of a coincidence that it gets hard to believe. The \"next Messi\" in the arms of Messi as a baby now playing for that same troubled club.. but if it can actually be traced back to a post of his father that was made at that time, fair enough.\n\nOne of the pictures shows his mom as well\n\nBut yeah, it‚Äôs crazy. Messi with the Jesus look basically christening him.¬†\n\nhe literally is from catalonia its not that crazy\n\nDid Messi just bathe every baby in the region? Weird coincidence else\n\nGod forbid a man has hobbies\n\nHis hobby is bathing babies?\n\nI‚Äôm not sure where the confusion is coming from here\n\nHe just blessed the chosen ones born with a high midochlorian count. Then from there they were raised in La Masia upon discharge from the maternity unit.\n\nMakes sense. Messi does kinda look like Liam Neeson.\n\nNo it was for some unicef campaign\n\n66.803 Catalonians were born in 2017 alone, still pretty crazy to me\n\n[https://www.idescat.cat/indicadors/?id=aec&amp;n=15265&amp;lang=en](https://www.idescat.cat/indicadors/?id=aec&amp;n=15265&amp;lang=en)\n\nThis is honestly so far out of what people that want to do a publicity would think of and also so random it just has to be true lol\n\nweird conspiracy theorists\n\nIf it didn't have the good sources i would of def thought it was fake too.\n\nIt literally was a publicity stunt for Unicef and Barcelona in 2007 or 2008. Barcelona was partnered with Unicef at the time. Lamine Yamal's family entered the raffle and won. I'm sure Messi has pictures with other kids as well. Of course at the time no body knew Lamine Yamal was going to end up becoming a footballer and a damn good one at that.\n\nBathed in the divine waters of Saint Messi. That kid is unreal, definitely something has been passed on to Yamal from that bath.\n\nSurely there's no way... What are the chances!?\n\nThey won a lottery for it. So you can literally calculate the odds....\n\nYamal turning out a Barca footballer is also a lottery. Crazier things have happened I suppose\n\nYes but when u combine the odds of both happening it gets astronomically a crazy coincidence\n\nWhere can I find other lotterys like this? I would like my naked baby to be bathed by Yamal so he too can become a multi millionare footballer\n\nThere are no such thing as accidents -Oogway\n\nStrong symbolism\n\nthe promised prince....unreal scipt\n\nJust wow, If the story wasn't on the bbc and hadn't got good sources I would never of believed this but wow the football gods blessed both\n\nit doesn't get more the chosen one trope than this\n\nWhat is the context of this image?\n\nThe new Spanish wonderkid who scored that great goal yesterday (Lamine Yamal) was apparently baptised by Messi when he was a baby. This is a funny coincidence (to most people), or a modern miracle (to some extremely religious football fans).\n\nNot baptised, just bathed.\n\nMy mistake, sorry\n\nLocal kids with barca players charity/publicity/community outreach thing. Plenty of others kids and barca players gave pictures like this but those arent interesting\n\nNo one's given you a straight answer so here.\n\n  \nThe baby, lamine yamal, is a Spanish wonderkid. Messi and yamal both start at barca, very similar story. Yamal's family won a lottery to get the wonderkid messi to bathe their baby, huge coincidence\n\n[deleted]\n\nLazy day innit\n\nWhere is the photo of Maradona blessing Messi when he was a baby?\n\nBlessed by God of Football himself, no wonder Lamine Yamal is playing well.\n\nAnime main character.\n\nThe world is a stage\n\nYou get it. \n\nI still love both of them though.\n\nNo fucking way man\n\ntalent is transferable\n\nWell done Messi, you did it!\n\ngold\n\nOnly Messi can give birth to football geniuses.\n\nIs yamal just deku?\n\nThis is so weird. Not because of the fact if who Yamal has turn out to be but more because I‚Äôll never let some athlete take this types of pictures with my newborn\n\nIt was a charity thing for UNICEF, he didn‚Äôt just turn up at their house\n\nDon‚Äôt destroy my hope of Messi turning up at my house to bathe my baby son\n\nüò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠\n\nBro it‚Äôs Messi\n\nWho cares if it‚Äôs fucking Alexander the Great it‚Äôs definitely weird still\n\nBro in asian culture (south) it‚Äôs normal\n\nThe photo choice of Messi giving a baby a bath has not aged well\n\n^[Sokka-Haiku](https://www.reddit.com/r/SokkaHaikuBot/comments/15kyv9r/what_is_a_sokka_haiku/) ^by ^QouthTheCorvus:\n\n*The photo choice of*\n\n*Messi giving a baby*\n\n*A bath has not aged well*\n\n---\n^Remember ^that ^one ^time ^Sokka ^accidentally ^used ^an ^extra ^syllable ^in ^that ^Haiku ^Battle ^in ^Ba ^Sing ^Se? ^That ^was ^a ^Sokka ^Haiku ^and ^you ^just ^made ^one.\n\nAm I the only one that finds this just weird?\n\nIsn‚Äôt weird, Bar√ßa had partnership with UNICEF. Yamal is from a poor neighborhood from Catalonia. They did these photos in order to rise awareness and it‚Äôs a coincidence Lamine was one of these kids and Messi was the one who was going to bath him. Father and mother are 17-18 more or less.\n\nI know the context, I just find weird a 19 year old footballer chilling with random babies lol.\n\nI mean it‚Äôs normal in asia (south)\n\nHe‚Äôs no Robbie Savage at the same age.\n\nLamine Yamal is a talented young footballer with a bright future ahead of him.\n\nthe picture is real...yamal is the prince that was promised\n\nWhere's the picture of Penaldo holding baby Mcfrappe?\n\nIt's a really random thing and in the same time I don't think it's random and there's something it's not told to us. First assumption, this ad with one of the best and most famous players in the world gave him motivation over his life. Second assumption, Yamal was a football project from his early life and one of his family was working in Barcelona club\n\nSo messi has seen yamal's pecker?  ü§£\n\nMost likely had a diaper or underwear on\n\nArrest that man!\n\nAnd now Jude Bellingham is gonna break his legs\n\nSure\n\nIs he taking that bath in Luke Shaw‚Äôs pocket or?\n\nFucking weird\n\nWho gives a shit?"

Most of them play the game with conviction above the average player\n\nIt‚Äôs crazy how much he was able to get out of some players\n\nImagine getting man of match and people start saying you are that old and bad your teammates should be ashamed \n\nLmao\n\nI said to Man Utd fans that Johnny Evans and Maguire is better than Martinez and DeLigt and they get upset. But even ETH agrees\n\nSlab head &gt; the butcher\n\n[deleted]\n\nHe clearly agrees after seeing the horrible display of Martinez and De Lig in the cup game lol. That's why he bench them even though they ain't injured.\n\n[deleted]\n\nManchester supporters are so stupid lol. Martinez and De Lig are trash\n\nWhat team do you support?\n\n[deleted]\n\nShame because Evans is a good defender and has had a good career. Has been a good signing as a back up, not his fault those in front of him haven‚Äôt done their job.¬†\n\nIt's a fair point to be honest when your 36 old fourth CB ,who you brought in as a rotational piece is the best player on the pitch it speaks volumes about your starters\n\nI don‚Äôt think he said Evans is bad - it‚Äôs more like even at 36 evans is still playing better than the others who r younger which usually is not the case it‚Äôs a rare case\n\nIt was shocking. It's like saying older players are not supposed to win MOTM.¬†\n\nI actually get what he means. It's not that they aren't supposed to win. But that the younger guys are not hungry enough or working hard enough.\n\n\nI mean cmon 36? Remember how everyone was clowning Ronaldo for starting for Portugal. Imagine if he was getting motm and was the best performer in the Portugal team?\n\nBerba's just disgusted at what the club has become. He's right. There should be young players trying to make their names.\n\nEvans in his prime was a substitute in UTD. Now about 10 years later, he is man of the match.\n\nHe was better at Leicester imo\n\nTHIS!\n\nWining MOTM doesn\\`t make you the best player of the team, just in that **one** game you performed awesome.   \nBut there is fun fact for you. Jony Evans played the more games than any other United defender last season, while been brought up during Summer just to keep his fitness up\n\nIf in your primw you were a substitute, you shouldn't be able to be a candidate for MOTM in years when you are basically retired. If you are, something's wrong with other players in both teams.\n\nHe \"got a fucking clue\". \n\nWhat a \"lad\".\n\nHe's right that the team is miserable but he didn't need to word it like that. Dig on Evans was unnecessary. Maybe they disliked each other as teammates.\n\nNah it was more like ‚ÄúI played with this guy however long ago and he can still put in a better performance than everyone else who‚Äôs supposed to be playing for the badge‚Äù\n\nAgree, I don't read that as a dig at Evans at all. He's saying the only guy with any credit from that game is from the old school, and everyone else, despite being on bigger wages and having much higher profiles, were dross.\n\nHe digs on everyone else, not on Evans. I think Evans would have agreed with him. No matter how good you are, your physical ability degrades over time, there is just no question about it.\n\nFive years ago, no one could have predicted that Johnny Evans would be MOTM for Man United.\n\nAs was pointed out in the United sub - Evans was MOTM for both teams. So Villa players were included in the voting too.\n\nYeah but Villa just having an off-day isn‚Äôt the same as Man U‚Äôs multi-year malaise\n\nBerba is so insightful.\n\nIt‚Äôs a team of players with the quality to actually belong in the 14th spot. Someone has to be 14th and it‚Äôs United.\n\nWho knew Evans would turn out to be the best United signing of the Ten Hag era.\n\nPersonally I thought eriksen was the best player on the pitch\n\nEvan‚Äôs being treated like shit here and he‚Äôs doing his absolute best. Top class deep system centre back , if he doesn‚Äôt have to play out from the back or play on the half way line he‚Äôs not putting a foot wrong\n\nHello from kerala blasters.\n\nTough times at the Reds\n\nGetting slandered by ex-teammates for having a MOTM performance üòÇ\n\nHe's slandering the young players, not Jonny\n\nYoung players should be hungry to do well, it‚Äôs insane that the oldest in the pitch was MOM.\n\nDimitar Berbatov - Thank you for your opinion. It's just trash like other United's ex players used to say. For once in your life, appreciate a player who played well even though he's old.¬†\n\nThe opinion of a former player is stupid again, let‚Äôs move on.\n\nhow do you disagree? they‚Äôre playing horrendously for the amount they‚Äôve spent\n\nThey are horrendous, but it‚Äôs just really shitty to pick out a player like Evans and say other should be ashamed he got man of the match. Not only is it incredibly disrespectful to Evans who was chosen as the best on the pitch, but the criticism also needs levelled at Villa. Why wasn‚Äôt one of their players man of the match if Evans getting it is so terrible?\n\nAnd can you imagine anyone saying that about Zlatan, Messi or Ronaldo? Why does Evans age matter when judging his performances but not any other player? Why is Evans on the pitch if the idea of him being man of the match is awful? \n\nAll for criticising Man Utd. Ten Hag is really struggling. But this is just a terrible way of framing it and shitting on Evans (inadvertently) at the same time. Imagine Evans buzzing on his way home having won the award and a valuable point for his team (against another top side) and then he hears that shit from Berbatov? It‚Äôs just an awful, awful take.\n\nImagine comparing Jonny Evans to Zlatan, Messi and Ronaldo and expecting to be taken seriously\n\nYou seem to have missed the point. He‚Äôs no where near their level. Which is my exact point. No one would make the same comment about those 3 because they are elite players. So using Evans age as a factor is really saying ‚ÄúJonny Evans isn‚Äôt actually *that* good, so you should all be better‚Äù. If all Man Utd players should be ashamed, so should all Villa players. And all the players in the squads who couldn‚Äôt even get on the pitch ahead of Jonny Evans. Evans did his job better than *any* other player on the pitch. Any player on any given day can be man of the match; and no one should be shamed for not being good enough to be man of the match. \n\nThe message is right; Man Utd are awful. It‚Äôs just disrespectful to Evans to phrase it like that.\n\nYou‚Äôre being pedantic and you know it. Berbatov is saying Manchester United should never have to rely on 36 year Jonny Evans putting in a MOTM performance to draw against Aston Villa.\n\nAnd that‚Äôs understandable seeming when he was at United a younger Jonny Evans wasn‚Äôt even good enough to make the starting XI. With the players they currently have, someone like Fernandes or Rashford or one of their many expensive signings would be expected to step up in big games, much like they were when Berbatov was at United.\n\nWhether 2024 United should even be compared to the Ferguson days is a valid point though. Totally different club at this point.\n\nWell he shouldn‚Äôt be. He was an emergency signing last year who‚Äôs still there\n\nEvans isn't Messi or Ronaldo, that's why it's relevant.\n\nMessi was arguably player of the tournament at the WC. Should every single player at that tournament have been ashamed? Completely irrelevant point brining up Evans age. He's 36 not 46.\n\nslight difference between messi and evans, no discredit to the guy. There‚Äôs a difference between saying ‚ÄòEvans at 36‚Äô and ‚Äòa 36 year old‚Äô\n\na past his prime johnny evans should not be man utds best player\n\n0-0 at Villa is absolutely fine. And a 36 year old is allowed to be man of the match.\n\nHave u been watching them play this year?\n\nUnfortunately\n\nDoesn't change the fact that a point away from home against a Villa side who are on form is a decent result, especially when we are in bad form.\n\nI agree. But to put it in perspective they were fighting relegation 2 or 3 seasons ago.\n\nAnd now they are in the champions league and beat Bayern 4 days ago. Your point is null and void\n\nNo it's not. One of the biggest clubs in the world breathing a sigh of relief after drawing against villa who were fighting relegation 2-3 seasons ago is really bad state of affairs. Nothing to be satisfied with. It's laughable that the fanbase has accepted this reality.\n\nClassic reddit lol, Berbs is spot on. If a 36 y.o Evans is keeping the backline together there's proper problems in the squad. Nothing wrong with him being motm and putting on a great performance. Context matters though, and if someone brought in to be mostly a backup CB is outclassing the actual starting CBs, there's clearly issues.\n\nwater cake ad hoc chief employ crown towering sheet connect zephyr\n\n *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev/home)*\n\nHe‚Äôs not spot on, but yeah keep it going why don‚Äôt ya\n\nI'd rather take the opinion of a former footballer that won titles with Man United when they were at their peak. A player that was an outstanding forward in his time.\n\nI'd take their opinion of yours, someone who hasn't played professionally or won a title or even has any football credentials.\n\nGo for it, I don‚Äôt give a fuck what you think\n\nVery argumentative for someone who's clearly arguing the wrong point.\n\nMeh he's clearly an angsty teen, not worth the time\n\nI get the point he's making but it sounded like a dig at Johnny Evans. I don't think he intended it to sound like a cheapshot, but it did.\n\nWasn't berbatov notoriously lazy and never ran for anything back in the day? What's he piping up for?\n\nHe was also very talented unlike most of these lot.¬†"

    "all_comment_text": "Oh so now UEFA has nothing better to do than investigate an inside joke?\n\nUEFA have finished their investigation and confirmed that England are actually a very public joke.\n\nLove Bellingham but acting like grabbing your crotch facing people is an inside joke is naive at best\n\nHe did it on other occasions to specific fans in the stands after the game, so it's niave to assume it wasn't an inside joke.\n\nIt's only Europe and some international countries watching. And frankly, I don't find it funny.\n\nUEFA Official Statement: 2032 Euro games are in Dubai!\n\nYou don‚Äôt actually buy the inside joke line do you?\n\nIt‚Äôs Bellingham, he has a documented history of having nothing but respect for how Slovakia play\n\nNothing will happen.\n\n‚ÄúBasic rules of decent conduct‚Äù??? In a game where people fall over with the slightest touch, blatantly dive and feign injury on the regular?  Pull the other one\n\nThose are met with yellow cards.\n\nThey‚Äôre supposed to be but are rarely enforced\n\n I have seen other trend, referees give yellow for anything it feels\n\nYeah in terms of rules though it's there and they could do retrospective but they generally leave refs on field decisions as final, for better or worse\n\nWhile we all wish they were, you know that isn't true.\n\nThe rules are still there to do so, just as they are there for Bellingham\n\nBellingham‚Äôs dive in the box wasn‚Äôt.\n\nPlayers usually get an automatic yellow card for taking off their shirt. There is also yellow cards given to players when they start pushing shoving eachother after a bad tackle.\n\nI don‚Äôt think anything will happen because they want England in the final.\n\n'They want England in the final' please explain this tinfoil hat comment\n\nIt is in UEFAs best financial interest to have England in the final than a team like Austria.  Not really a tinfoil hat theory\n\nLmao they want England in the final what kind of cope statement is that\n\nWho are 'they'? Are 'they' in the room with you now?\n\nFootballing authorities who govern disciplinary cases but also take into account how prominent the subjects are, what stage the tournament is at, react to lobbying, financiers, spectacle and even nationality when considering their decisions.\n\nThe success of the sport in terms of glamour, financial gain and hierarchy have an effect on FIFA and UEFA rulings at every juncture. Rulings can go in different directions but there isn't a tradition of universal even handedness.\n\nThe ref didn't get the memo then did he\n\nHave them enough added time to get the draw but really hard to have an impact when the team does not get a shot on target.\n\nRight. \n\nThey should look into fans maybe. Or most of Spain racist fans when Vini plays. \n\nNahhhh let‚Äôs fine the stars when they give back to the fans what they‚Äôre giving\n\nJude was one of the worst for diving as well to be fair.\n\nYea. But to be fair. He‚Äôs played 90min of every game so far, coming off CL and La liga wins where he played most those games too üòÖ\n\nHe's english it's not diving.\nIt's \"goes down easy\" especially according to Lee Dixon on ITV last night\n\n\"presents his cock\"\n\nDidn't know English fans were craving that.\n\nIt's why Spotted Dick is such a delicacy over here.\n\nTebas will tell you there are no racist fans, just Vini Jr showing off too much.\n\nIcardi got a match suspension for doing that move in Turkey\n\nThis is spot on, it's a deployable tactic now by shite teams and it's legitimised by the officials. Gets on my nips.\n\nIt‚Äôs been a tactic for a long time‚Ä¶Italy\n\nBasically 50% of copa America\n\nThat is why I would like to see a 5 minute injury timeout. Ow you are, rolling on the floor like a madman, you must be  really badly injured then... Go sit on the side for 5 minutes to heal... Let's see how many are still so badly hurt by a minor touch...\n\nLol such a stupid idea.\n\nHence why weak players always bother me.. You‚Äôll never see a fight in Football or anyone actually stepping up for a player.. because the second someone gets tapped on the face.. They fall and act like they have been shot. Would be better to see more players carded for flops and embellishments\n\nI think MLS instituted something like this. If you are down for more than a certain amount of time, you have to go off the field for a minute or two.\n\nI don't know what game you've seem but I have seen slovakian players' ankles doing 180s after some duels with the english players, you can't get up after something like this. Anyway the ref exagerated with the extra time, it should have been 4 minutes maybe 5 but surely not 6\n\n6 was accurate given the game stopped multiple times for injuries\n\nRonaldo did it vs atletico and it wasn't suttle at all , nothing will happen\n\n&gt;In a game where people fall over with the slightest touch, blatantly dive and feign injury on the regular?\n\nUmmm. WHAT?\n\nFalling over with the slightest touch, diving and feigning injury are all things we don't want to see in the game. However, they are all *a little* different from mimicking putting his dick in someone's [by what it is investigated/alleged, people on Slovakia's bench] mouth. If those two things are the same in your eyes something is seriously wrong...\n\nOr maybe it is not going to happen that fast.\n\nWhere are the \"oh he's so mature\" fan bitches\n\n[deleted]\n\nSo players should only get sanctioned when killing someone... noted.\n\nLmao I love this. \n\nThe Real fans come out in force and downvote anything negative towards him. \n\nHe's an arrogant twat in my eyes. Screaming \"who else\" for an equalizer.\n\ni dont blame him. Heat of the moment after scoring a 90+5 minute equaliser to save his own country. Cut him some slack for that\n\nNaw he's an arrogant twat.\n\nkid scores for his country seconds before elimination, but if he celebrates too much some fat nerd on the internet calls him arrogant lmao. I guarantee you that guy has never played football or any competitive sport in his life.\n\nWho else is right. Wasn't going to be fucking Foden or Saka was it\n\nLmao Foden almost was super close with his offside goal. \n\nIf Kane finished his cross...\n\nHe scored like 4 of these types of big moment goals at Madrid last season, let the man celebrate. You think English people give a fuck what hes saying as he‚Äôs celebrating they just happy he gave them a goal. Mf like you (anti-madrid no matter what) shoot down anything and everything that even are remotely related to madrid.\n\nLmao ü§£\n\nBc that was an epic moment. Guess u want lame ass footballers with no emotion playing. Makes sense that you are a city fan\n\nLmao that actually makes no sense\n\nWell he was fucking right wasn‚Äôt he? He did what he does\n\nPretty sure Kane also scored a goal...\n\nExactly. Where‚Äôs the ‚Äúhe‚Äôs only 20‚Äù army\n\nMy goat cr7 would never\n\nNo he'd probably have left the stadium and gone home sulking when the fans started booing the performance.\n\nHe did much worse on a humid night in¬† Vegas.\n¬†\n\nSince people didnt understand. It was a reference to cr7 celebration for the saudi team.\n\nI think this is ridiculous, not really something worthy of an investigation regardless of whatever anyone might think of the guy.\n\nGenital gesture always gets investigated stop babying this guy\n\nbig scary genitals\n\nWat?\n\nAt least someone in the team displayed a pair of bollocks\n\nHow exactly does that investigation go?\n\nIt deserves at least a one match ban this tournament. Get your head out of your ass. Belligham is a good player, but he must not act like he's a god among men that gets to do whatever he wants in front of the millions of fans.\n\nThis guy has as much talent as he has ego. He needs to seriously chill. I know hes young, but still\n\nYeah he‚Äôs definitely believing in his own hype. Should probably have been sent off in the 1st and 3rd games.\n\nThis won't end well.\n\noh yeah, surely didnt end well for Ronaldo lmao\n\nYou make it sound like that ego made him loose something in life, if anything, that inflated ego's the reason he achieved his every single trophy, it pushes the guy to back it up- through hard work and thereby pushing performance, but age catches to you in some way.   \nIf ego made me even 1% of what he has achieved, I say is definitely worth it to be a jerk.  \nI can guarantee you that if this sub members would have been given all the resources still 98% wouldn't be even at bench warmer at any top 50 clubs.\n\nyou make it sound like he's some noname hoping to make it big one day. he already achieved more than most players will achieve in their whole career and is scoring the most important goals for his club and country. I'd say it's too late to say things like it won't end well.\n\nI didn't meant his career in sports. Coping with so much success when you are as young as him can take a toll of a man.\n\nMbappe, Vini, Bellingham. Where are Madrid gonna fit those egos on one field?\n\nAnd Vini is by far the most likeable one.\n\nNever seen a young player so mature.\n\nwow that probably means Balor Dor for Messi\n\nDude has been acting like an entitled twat for a long time now. People have just been giving him a pass because hes popular.\n\nIs he popular? In England? Or is it forced upon us. That ‚Äòson of the nation‚Äô stuff is bizarre. Who anointed him that apart from his own PR.\n\nI'm not English, I think he's class. I don't know how much of his own PR plays into those kind of headlines - he speaks incredibly well for his age, compared to his peers, in fact irrespective of his age. He seems pretty humble, considering, and he seems like a decent dude. I think if Foden behaved himself more in his ascension, he'd have that title.\n\nI don‚Äôt understand what you mean by speak well. He‚Äôs not particularly eloquent, he can put a few sentences together. So can lots of others- Saka, Stones, Watkins, Rice all speak intelligently and calmly too. You must have really low standards or not pay attention to others who are just, if not better, than him in terms of articulation.\n\nWas the argentina goalie investigated for his remark when collecting his golden glove in the 2022 world cup?\n\n[deleted]\n\nWhat was the outcome?\n\n[deleted]\n\nYeh and how much media coverage did it get? Compared to this, zero!\n\nWas always going to be investigated, this is UEFA we're talking about. No one is buying this inside joke nonsense.\n\nAnd Emi Martinez got nothing for making a penis from a trophy, if he gets banned he should just get played anyway with a shirt with the martinez incident photo on it because it's a joke if he gets a ban.\n\nQue miras bobo? Anda pa' lla\n\nProbably because FIFA is amazingly enough in charge of the FIFA world cup, and UEFA even more amazingly is in charge of the UEFA EURO. So FIFA and UEFA won't have the same rules or take the same action, quite amazingly\n\nDiego Simone \nRonaldo \n\nBoth did it under UEFA regulated games and got a fine\n\nHe will get a fine - anything more is ridiculous\n\nYou justifying one despicable, coward action just says everything about your biased opinion. Completely useless.\n\nEmi Martinez also humped in the faces of the Dutch after the pens.\n\nArgentina were unbelievably unsportsmanlike the entire World Cup and yet Jude might get punished for this. Let‚Äôs just say it‚Äôs inconsistent at best¬†\n\nWhat has FIFA got to do with UEFA?\n\nIf that gesture was directed at the Slovakia bench, he ought to be banned. That's some silly, childish, ugly thing to be doing in full view of the whole world. Man, what the fuck... It is sad, because he scored a bicycle kick last minute equaliser that kept his nation in the tournament and helped them avoid a very shameful exit - and then he does a gesture of him putting his dick in someone's mouth. Inside joke, riiiiight...\n\nThat was FIFA in charge of that tournament.¬†\n\nabsolutely... no one is.\n\nI mean my I‚Äôve dug around and actually it does seem to be celebration  that he‚Äôs done before at rm and nacho has done it as well so yeah it seems to be running gag that got scrutiny here\n\nLol, when Martinez did this celebrating the WC this sub went crazy saying shit like ‚Äúunsportsmanlike behavior‚Äù, but now everyone is defending Bellingham. The double moral is gigantic.\n\nTo be fair that‚Äôs only natural because Martinez is a massive bellend, he kind of brings it on himself\n\nHaters gonna hate, he ate every European team that Argentina faced. You just can't answer with football, so you answer with words.\n\nI thought Martinez was absolutely hilarious for doing that with the golden glove trophy, but I‚Äôm not fussy on decorum.\n\nI also found it funny. The act and the reaction in a corrupt country that FIFA sold it's soul to.\n\nMostly English sub innit? Same on the F1 subreddit.\n\nIsit\n\n[deleted]\n\nAnd of being obnoxious af\n\nAnd defeating every \"superior\" European team he faced, lol\n\n\nSeethe harder, Argentina gets stronger with every xenophobic hater.\n\nLook, I‚Äôm not saying I‚Äôm right here, but as an Argentinian, what Martinez did wasn‚Äôt to provoke or say ‚ÄúSuck my c*ck‚Äù. He was just playing dumb with the trophy pretending it was his d*ck. It‚Äôs stupid and fun, and not meant to be insulting (although some people could get offended, yes). Now what Jude did was stare at the Slovakia bench and gesture with his hand as if they where blowing him. Are you really saying that isn‚Äôt insulting? Or at least worst than what Dibu did?\n\nEntendiste todo al rev√©s pa, estoy defendiendo al Dibu üòÇ\n\nSabes que ten√©s raz√≥n JAJAJAJAJA perd√≥n loco, entend√≠ re mal. Me pasa por leer apurado, pens√© que lo estabas criticando, disculpame.\n\nIt‚Äôs almost as if ‚Äòthis sub‚Äô is a collection of different people with different views. If you can find one user who called Emi‚Äôs behaviour unsportsmanlike and who is also defending Bellingham, I‚Äôll eat my words.\n\nFor me, neither is unsportsmanlike, and both are crass and childish gestures. I like Jude but these Euros are going to really test his ability to not disappear up his own arse along with the gust of sunshine being blown up there.\n\nThere is a big difference between believing something is unsportsmanlike and thinking it should be investigated and penalized lol\n\nMate when Martinez did it he was hailed as the second coming by Reddit.\n\nYou can‚Äôt say that about their golden boy who was nowhere to be seen on the pitch for 95 minutes.\n\nBoth are unsportsmanlike and niether deserve a bann\n\nDibu did it for fun, not to mock anyone else. Big difference.¬†\n\n\nThe only ones that seethed with Emi's gesture were Argentina's haters.\n\nLove it when people pretend all other Redditors are the same Redditor üòÇ\n\nShould have seen red\n\nMr Mature finally being seen for the petulant child he is. He actually needs to learn basic leadership skills and etiquette so all that hyperbolic nonsense about him being a wiser than his years leader can be put to bed now.\n\nBro, why are you so pressed about him? Jfc.\n\nI‚Äôm gonna take ‚Äòreasons related to systemic racism‚Äô for $500, thanks Alex.\n\nSoft\n\nMeh, give him a warning.\n\nBan against Switzerland please\n\nWhat am I missing?? Keep seeing people saying it's disrespectful, etc... what did he actually do, and what does it mean?\n\nHe did the famous Ronaldo jerking off emote\n\nHe made the ‚Äúcupping my huge balls‚Äù hand gesture as part of his goal celebration. \n\nWho fucking cares. I guess other people have been disciplined for this kind of thing in the past? Can‚Äôt say I‚Äôd agree with that either. \n\nIt‚Äôs just really not that bad, especially relative to the things that are allowed to slide. Everyone has their favorite example of something we need to curb in this game - be it simulation, time wasting, etc. But gesturing ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got big balls‚Äù is where we decide to get a committee together to ‚Äúinvestigate‚Äù. Lame.\n\nThat's it? That's what all the fuss is about? This world is ass backwards, thought he done a nazi salute or something. Got every right to gesture the huge balls it takes to try an overhead kick while losing in the 90th minute.\n\nShould have been a normal yellow during the game. Don't think the investigation will do anything, but let's just wait.\n\nThis is exactly it.  This world is freaking insane.\n\nYou have to understand that nowadays in Europe people are very worried about bofa\n\nLet‚Äôs all blame Southgate for that too lol\n\nSilly, this is sports.\n\nHe will be fined. Probably a Game ban to send a Message.\nRespect is the most important Aspect of football and he clearly lacks it.\n\nSo is the entire country of Spain gonna be banned for the monkey chants\n\nIf they file a Investigation yes\n\nLolll\n\nHe didn't do at the other team. Who didn't he show respect to?\n\nAnd before you say he did, he literally  did it after the game when there where no opposing players on the field to fans in the stand\n\nAbsolutely pathetic.\n\nUEFA is dogshit through and through. Grow the fuck up you stupid whiny overpaid cunts\n\nMy üê´ could never\n\nSeems like a massive Streisand effect this. I imagine more people know it's happened because of this investigation...\n\nRediculous, he was just pumping the crowd to get back into the game\n\nBellendham at it again\n\nThis reminds me of this [fighter.](https://izismile.com/2022/11/03/mma_fighter_interview_video.html)\n\nTBH, it might be no bad thing if he was suspended for a game.\n\nYes he scored, but there's something clearly not working in England's attack and maybe this would force Southgate to try something else.\n\nHe is a good player, but the hype surrounding him has handcuffed the staff. He is stifling any creativity from the middle of the pitch, but he has a great work rate and positional sense. Arriving late and potting from 6 yards out (pretty much every time) he has done very well for both club and country.\n\nHe is a good player, but the hype surrounding him has handcuffed the staff. He is stifling any creativity from the middle of the pitch, but he has a great work rate and positional sense. Arriving late and potting from 6 yards out (pretty much every time) he has done that very well for both club and country.\n\nOn his day, he's a brilliant player. But for whatever reason, it's just not working for England yet.\n\nI'm really hoping he proves me wrong and starts showing his Real Madrid form. But sometimes the best individual player just isn't right for a particular team, and so far that seems to be the case here.\n\nI mean, this pretty much was his Real Madrid form for the second half of the season; not a progressive player and mostly disappearing against tougher competition (especially in UCL). \n\nFirst half, different story‚Ä¶Ancelotti deploying him out of his normal position as a false 9, surrounded by some of the best providers in the world suited his game perfectly. Second half, teams adjusted. We‚Äôll see if he can make an adjustment to have the success again that he witnessed first half.\n\nThe whole team is playing like shit but you're singling out Bellingham who has scored twice, one of them being an injury time bicycle kick equalizer?\n\nNot singling him out. But he's the only one who's got a threat of suspension, and something needs to change. \n\nIt's great scoring an injury time equaliser. But with all of that attacking talent, we shouldn't need until the 95th minute to get our first shot on target against Slovakia. And it's not like that was a one-off.\n\nAre they investigating the Slovakian staff member grabbing Rice by the throat?\n\nAs an American I can say that it‚Äôs perfectly fine o grab players by the throat and should not result in any sort of disciplinary action.\n\nLmao the sarcasm was missed by all the downvoters üòÇ\n\nTo be fair, most of the people here wouldn‚Äôt watch a USA match unless they were playing their country so they would have no idea how often a USA player has been blatantly grabbed by the throat and had nothing happen to the assailant.\n\ndraymond, is that you?\n\nThis is quite hilarious üòÇ¬†\n\nHe should‚Äôve been sent off before his equalizer, not after for being an arrogant brat- which he indubitably is, although that‚Äôs not an infraction in itself\n\nYeah, he will get a one match ban when England reach the final\n\nWhy is this in football sub? Or is this guy getting drafted by the Chiefs\n\nWhat?\n\nIt‚Äôs soccer not football\n\nHaha you‚Äôre in the wrong sub mate.\n\nIdiot for doing the gesture. Got to be way more composed going forth.\n\nRonaldo did it vs atletico but nothing happened\n\nThis is so stupid. It's perfectly fine to be a bit cheeky and provocative in football games.  \nThat's all part of it.\n\nJust make him pay a fine and get on with it. Of all the ridiculous nonsense going on, a man grabbing his crotch is the least of anyone‚Äôs worries\n\nGreat role model for the youth of the uk to disrespect your opponents like that\n\nThis would never happen to the kane\n\nWhat‚Äôs sad is England needed a late comeback to beat *checks notes* Slovakia üá∏üá∞ lol, I mean yeah be proud of that win England/ Jude you‚Äôre really showing the world üåé\n\nI mean so what? Everyone slated England for dominating Slovenia but failing to score. Don‚Äôt see anyone slating Portugal for struggling against them last night.\n\nBecause Portugal üáµüáπ actually wins international football tournaments: England is in the process of choking away their golden generation\n\nWhat is wrong with those arrogant overrated players . You show that kind of behaviour then just suspend them for a year playing any football !\n\nWhat he did? I didn‚Äôt watch the game\n\nBan him\n\nA team with 117 charges don't bother UEFA but a celebration does!!\n\nAh so this is what he did for 95 minutes, prepared this celebration for ‚Äúhis friend‚Äù. Was wondering where the future balon dor was against the powerhouse team of Slovakia.\n\nBellingham is world class, but what he did after scoring last minute - cupping his ears and puppet talking towards fans for criticizing hin and england is exactly their problem and why they never win these majors. They just cant handle critics, yet fans have every right to do that after those performances\n\nUEFA body shaming Bellingham‚Äôs massive balls\n\nGames gone¬†\n\nGame's gone.\n\nHe made an obscene gesture, if they consider that‚Äôs against the rules, he‚Äôd have to get disciplined as everyone else would. Shouldn‚Äôt expect any special treatment.\n\nHis celebration was excessive, but that's the emotions that come with being a young player.\n\nI can imagine a fine for this, sure. If uefa bam Bellingham it's not gonna look right at all.\n\nJude Bellingham is a prick. I say that as an England fan. Imagine shouting \"Who Else\" after being total dog shit for 94 minutes against Slovakia and scoring a lucky goal.\n\nAlso the people acting like the finish was world class ought to rewatch Bales goal in the CL final, or Ibras against England, or Rooneys against Man City. Scoring a bicycle kick from inside 6 yards is something a Sunday League player could do.\n\nThis guy has been so consumed by his own ego he doesn't even want to take the criticism for how shite England have been at this Euros."

    "all_comment_text": "A footballer‚Äôs career is so fickle. Just look at Gavin Bazunu also, Achilles rupture during a pre-match warm up and that‚Äôs the guts of two seasons lost with career question marks to follow\n\nThe same thing happened to Falco. ACL is one of the worst injury you can have a player.¬†\n\nAchilles isn't an acl?¬†\n\nMay be he was right in the end and he played too many games between City and national team?\n\nSo the only thing that Happens ins Teams are not obliged to let Players play in national Teams\n\nEasily fixable. There should be a cap on the amount they are allowed to play. X amount of games in a given time frame, which rolls consistently.\n\nI think this is a good idea, if well designed. Should be a rolling 30 day, 3 month, and 12 month cap on playing time in all competitions, with the longer time periods having stricter limits. Main challenge would be how national teams would operate though -- if included, the incentive to not play internationally would be very high, but if excluded, it would partly defeat the purpose, because internationals are a key part of the load\n\nInternational is allowed to use a player in 75% of matches with exception of World Cup/Copa/Euro (not qualifiers) . Exception of the player if the player has extra match allotment from not being played to max capacity with the club.\n\nYeah, maybe. \n\nOr, could count internationals towards the monthly limit, but not the three-month or twelve-month limit.\n\nWhich would be horrible and kill the sport completely. National teams are the highest purpose of this sport. Nothing compares to World Cup or Euro.\n\nThere‚Äôs an entire bench the coach should be forced to use, in stead of always just fielding your best players regardless of their health!\n\nOk but nobody gives a fuck about the vast majority of international friendlies and qualifiers so give the kids a chance and rest the pros for big games\n\n0.2 games too many\n\nIt wasn't only him who played so many matches. Other players did in other clubs.¬†\n\nWhat point do you think you're making?\n\nShould be back for the national league game against rochdale then\n\nImagine if they get relegated and he's played his final game for City.\n\nDoubt it will happen but that would be crazy.\n\nChanges the hole picture for Pep teams to lose the 6. Being Busquets, Fernandinho or Rodri his teams always drop a level by replacing the heart\n\n[deleted]\n\nIt‚Äôs hole\n\nFractured but hole\n\nBald\n\nI have no doubt he is overplayed\n\nIt will take someone to stand up and say no to playing a dead rubber or low level game to get the ball rolling on these players not being overlooked \n\nFor example, Rodri could say no to the Nations League or playing in the FA or league cup.\n\nI don't disagree with Rodri's take that there are a lot of matches being played, but i have a hard time feeling any sympathy for clubs like City. They have insane squad depth. If Rodri feels like he's overplayed Pep should play a different player. If i'm overworked my first step isn't to go on strike, it's to tell my manager i'm being overworked. If we then don't come to an agreement a strike is the next option.\n\nThe problem is that the clubs that do rest players are at a disadvantage against the teams that don't. It needs to be a rule-change within leagues and maybe even UEFA-wide rather than be left to specific clubs.\n\nLeague Cup and Nations league make sense. Lower level competitions.\n\nShould have gone on strike lol\n\nHe kinda is now\n\nMore like strike out\n\nThat will be the last time he'll play in the EPL for City then.\n\nWe hope so\n\n[deleted]\n\nWym why\n\n115\n\nHe's injured, not dead\n\nBro is fuming\n\nSo if he wins the Balond‚Äôor, will he be the first Balond‚Äôor winner to play his next game in the championship?\n\n*league 2\n\nnation league north *\n\nNo way they give it to him. Far, far too dirty of a player.\n\nFA will say this is enough punishment for City, and ten points off Everton.\n\nIt'll be the foreign office stopping it all over confidential secrets or some crap.\n\n[deleted]\n\nthank you, It feels amazing to get compliments from you.\n\nI don't wish injury on any footballer.\n\nI also have no good things to say about Manchester City.\n\nSo I will just show myself out.\n\nOh come on have a beer at least. \n\nYou want a quick game of pool?\n\nCouldn't happen to a nicer fella\n\nMay he get all the rest he needs.\n\nBe careful what you wish for\n\nThat‚Äôs a shame\n\nNo problem. They will buy new ones.\n\nArguably the best player in the world. Not a replacement you can just grab off the shelf\n\nAlso, any good player approached will be reluctant to join knowing Rodri will bench them automatically upon return\n\nNot that city might be expelled from all leagues going forward?\n\nWell, only idiots believe that.\n\nHe won't be a good anymore.\n\nHe‚Äôll get that rest he has been craving\n\nIf he didn‚Äôt want to play all those games he should have just gone on strike and not get an injury like that\n\nCultural reset\n\nBuy Asslani from Inter for 30mil, great replacement for Rodri\n\nyou sound like Pep can just walk into a grocery store and buy whatever he wants..... oh well he can,that's why the 115 infractions\n\nLet‚Äôs do it, whatever it takes to get Asslani, he‚Äôs a great talent.\n\nlet's do it? I m mot in charge of signings at city,  or any football club for that matter.\n\nWe can do our part by spreading awareness of Asslani‚Äôs top tier footballing talent.\n\noh boy..... forgot your pills today?\n\nI‚Äôll be cured when Man City buys Asslani.\n\ncall me when they have a relegation party\n\nThere are too many matches no doubts, trainings are more advanced and intense now. More reason we have a handful of injuries now. Get well soon Rodri\n\nIf he didn‚Äôt want to play all those games he should have just gone on strike and not get an injury like that\n\nZubimendi to City in January makes a lot of sense.\n\nDon't think he will join City\n\nI think no one smart joins city until the 115 infractions verdict comes through\n\ntrue.\n\nIt‚Äôs his 115th injury\n\nDamn\n\nHe difference between Rodri and a player who doesn't get a season ending injury is here *points to head*\n\nDon‚Äôt, don‚Äôt give me hope, we might have a chance at the league\n\nAnd so it begins, the downfall of Rodri\n\nacl injuries are one of the few injuries that arn‚Äôt cyclical. a repaired acl is stronger then the original and rarely will tear again, especially with a players career. \n\nRodri also has a terrific injury record\n\nThis is some of the biggest load of nonsense I've ever read. It's very hard to fully recover from an ALC and most players who do end up having other niggling injuries.\n\nidk man, almost all the research points to repaired acl‚Äôs (especially in the relative short term, i.e the following few years) being stronger then the original acl. \n\nthe surgery also has up to a 97% success rate (probably even higher considering peps magic doctors in barcelona)\n\nI‚Äôd like to point you to the case study of Michael Owen\n\nMay I add on Falcao\n\nThought Owen's issue was his hamstrings\n\nthats anicdotal evidence, I am talking about actual largescale reaserch done on this topic.\n\nAlso in owens case, I would say it was Owens body simply being more prone to injury then the surgery itself being to blame. the same was true with R9\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8873562/ - some light reading on the topic.\n\nbacks up my claim\n\nYep. That's why I added it to the conversation as it's easy for folk to pick and choose individual examples but the body of research speaks for itself doesn't it.\n\nR9 didn‚Äôt tear his ACL. \n\nDo you know that bone heals stronger where it‚Äôs broken which leads to more breaks? Also ‚Äústronger‚Äù doesn‚Äôt really help in tissue that you want to be flexible\n\nyep, you are right abt r9, however my point still remains that some bodies are just more prone to injury and that the surgery is not always to blame.\n\nin this respect ‚Äústronger‚Äù just refers to its ability to do what is required of it, not necessarily some impact or tensile strength\n\nThat point is irrelevant such a heavy injury will cause other problems. Loss of agility, disbalances, ‚Ä¶.¬†\nEven the operation itself is bad. ¬†\n\nLook up Holger Badstuber¬†\n\nDo you have links to anything proving such? \n\nMost players that have ACL surgery do not return to the same levels they were before. I can‚Äôt name one that has\n\nJoe Gomez‚Äôs prime was after his ACL. Danny Ings too.\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4628627/\n\nhttps://www.doctorhackett.com/2020/03/26/is-a-reconstructed-acl-stronger-than-the-original/#:~:text=The%20ACL%2C%20or%20anterior%20cruciate,lowers%20their%20quality%20of%20life.\n\nhttps://curovate.com/blog/is-my-acl-graft-weaker-than-my-original-acl-or-is-my-acl-graft-stronger-than-my-original-acl/amp/\n\nBone doesn't actually heal stronger. The break site is stronger than the rest of the bone by the time it has healed due to the rest of the bone losing density as a result of inactivity during immobilisation. \n\nACL heals stronger because of the process of repair. The ACL is repaired by using a bone and tendon graft. They removed the centre of the patella tendon along with bone from it's convergence point on the patella and tibia. They then drill a hole in the femur and tibia and attach the tendon and bone graft with bone screws. Because of the way the surgery is done, the tendon that replaces the ligament now has it's own blood supply, it is much stronger than the actual ACL it replaced (the ACL has no blood supply and is instead kept alive using a special fluid but because there's no blood supply it's weak and can't heal)\n\nSo the break site is stronger which was the claim. \n\nWhich reduces mobility of the joint\n\nYou said it heals stronger, it doesn't. The break heals to the same strength as before but the rest of the bone loses density when it's not bearing weight and is immobile but broken bones don't affect joints unless you're snapping the head of the bone off\n\nOr Ronaldo (r9)\n\nOr del piero\n\nRonaldo didn‚Äôt do his ACL\n\nThe problem is, all the other parts of the knee struggle, my gf had two torn ACLS in different times of her life (also national level sporter) and both knees are bad now from surgeries and recovery. The acls itself are fine. Also mentally its a big challenge to return to the same level of play.\n\ni guess i would agree, but also stress the fact that Rodri has one of the best medical teams itw caring for him 24/7\n\nYea, I would say for these level of athletes (unlimited resources financially ) the mental part is the most important.\n\nFernando Torres went from being the best ST on the planet, to a hit and miss player who clearly lost a yard of pace.\n\nNow, Rodri‚Äôs game is not based on pace, so he will probably be just fine.\n\nWhat the fuck with Derrick Rose then\n\nI have a brace on my leg now that suggests otherwise.\n\nPossibly one of the wrongest things I‚Äôve read on the internet. What sources show this data?\n\nliterally all of them, look through this thread\n\nExcept they don‚Äôt back up what you stated.\n\nread them\n\nInitially stronger but weaken over time, reinjury rate between 6-31%. \n\nI know you‚Äôre wrong based on the fact you think it‚Äôs possible to have a major surgery and think your body will fix its self back to where it once was. That‚Äôs just not how it works.\n\nlmfao, ok bro\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4641548/\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8873562/\n\nSucks to suck. Hope you end up with exactly the amount of titles yall earned fairly, 0.\n\nUndeserved hate for a good player.\n\nNah, it‚Äôs deserved. He‚Äôs a tremendous player, but he‚Äôs incredibly dirty.\n\n[deleted]\n\nI mean, cheating isn‚Äôt fair hahaha\n\nNo respect to him\n\nRodri will now finally get the rest he's been crying for a long time. Although, this isn't how he wanted it but all the same, it's a time out and a rest.¬†\n\nOuch. I guess arsenal did succeed in injuring city‚Äôs best player. Hash tag dark arts team.\n\nhe injured himself, did you see the footage?\n\nYou can't say that. City fans will eat you alive. Arsenal was using dark arts throughout the game as many man city players also said about it.\n\nACL injury isn;t the type that player A inflict upon to player B\n\nI injured my ACL from a hard foul\n\nIt is though, Partey stood on Rodri's foot causing his knee to twist and cause an acl. It was Partey on Rodri.\n\nHave you recently played basketball? You‚Äôre supposed to play with a ball, not let them dribble your skull on the pavement."

Brilliant.\n\nNow I wanna watch the whole game not just Guler's wonder strike on repeat\n\nfirst goal was better imo\n\nT√ºrkiye is never ever boring in football. Maybe shit, but never boring\n\nI wouldn't say Turkey were a bad team.\n\nJust call them Turkey‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs like Germany insisting they be called Deutschland on English broadcasts‚Ä¶ totally insane\n\nWhy? Its equivalent to you telling someone how to pronounce their own name because its too difficult to learn\n\nBecause the president changed the name without popular consensus. I'm Turkish and I think calling them Turkiye is stupid.\n\nEdit... And it just sounds wrong. It's like the way my parents try to speak English and mix up Turkish and English.\n\nNo it‚Äôs not. Its¬†just something that‚Äôs not done.¬†I have no idea why you‚Äôre getting on your high horse about it.¬†\n\nWe don‚Äôt call Japan ‚ÄúNippon‚Äù, we don‚Äôt call Spain ‚ÄúEspa√±a‚Äù, we don‚Äôt call Italy Italia‚Äù and we don‚Äôt call Germany ‚ÄúDeutschland‚Äù.¬†\n\nYou‚Äôve just **made up** that there‚Äôs a requirement to do.¬†\n\nIf a country that they be called a certain way in a language, I would be slightly inclined to do so. I would defer to them how they want to be called.\n\nMost countries in the world name other countries differently than how the country being named names themselves, I just don't get the big deal like you make it out in your analogy\n\nA big example would be Japan, which they call Nippon, they don't give a shit. Or literally most other European countries speaking about another European country, and we don't give a shit.\n\nNo, it's equivalent to changing your name to something most people can't say, and then getting annoyed.\n\nHow many people who are writing in English are going to be able to type that name out with the special character?\n\nWhat if your name is Jamesor and people just decided they didnt want to bother how to learn to pronounce it and just called you James.\n\nWhat about if you've been happily going by James since fucking 1920, then all of a sudden you kick off demanding to be Jamesor and throwing your toys out if people dont change\n\nWhat if you never really wanted to be called James but just went along to \"not cause any trouble\"\n\nWell i guess, sticks and stones will break my bones, but words will never hurt me.\n\nThats what we teach children.\n\nJust seems disrespectful. Similar to how some people have \"ethnic names\" but change them to maje it easier for ppl to pronounce.\n\nIf we are speaking (or typing) in English we use the English names for countries. Simple as that. Or what do you call Georgia? Sakartvelo?\n\nT≈©rkiye is litterally the country‚Äôs English name.\n\nIt‚Äôs not different than Ivory Coast - which has been C√¥te d‚ÄôIvoire  in English for years.\n\nI speak English, we were taught to say Turkey so I‚Äôm staying with turkey ü¶É. You do you\n\nThis changed recently. We were all taught Turkey.\n\nIt‚Äôs T≈´rkiye now.\n\nIt's not.\n\nI didn‚Äôt share opinion.\n\nWhat I said is 100% factual.\n\nBut shit is boring, you can see shit everyday. It's only fun if you roll around and indulge in it.\n\nBut shit is boring, you can see shit everyday. It's only fun if you roll around and indulge in it.\n\nPot 3 VS pot 4 is the best game of the group stage. It's their best shot to get to the next round.\n\nI only watch Euros and World Cup. I'm not a big expert but to say I had fun watching it is a understatement!\n\nWatch Turkey 2008! CLUTCH!\n\nYesssss the streets remember Turkey in that tournament. Phoenix from the ashes\n\nColin Kazim Richards. Legend\n\nTurkey WC 2002 was a great run also\n\nHad luck for rest of their lives.\n\nDid you watch this game?\n\nWhat game?\n\nTurkey vs Georgia, Turkey were lucky they didn't concede more goals.\n\nI was refeering on 2008.\n\nAbsolutely criminal that it wasn't on US TV. This crap that they're doing with Fubo is ridiculous.\n\nFeel for American fans. It‚Äôs games like that that will get Americans into football the proper way, not by giving the country 3 international tournaments 3 years in a row when barely anyone in the country gives a shit.\n\ndrogon.tv. Thank me later.\n\nI will check it out.\n\nhttps://www.fullreplays.com/uefa/euro/turkey-vs-georgia-18-jun-2024/\n\ndo FoxSports or ESPN not stream them?\n\nNope. Not on fox sports, and ESPN doesn‚Äôt have the rights to the Euros\n\nESPN and Fox Sports stream them in South America, was just wondering if they also would in the United States\n\nEngland vs Serbia on the other end was snoozefest, I bet US broadcaster only showing big team games\n\nFootybites, everything for free\n\nVix is free if you have tmobile. That's how ivvle been watching the fubo matches\n\nI do have T-Mobile! How do you access it?\n\nJust google Vix and T-Mobile and you‚Äôll find a T-Mobile site about claiming Vix. IIRC it‚Äôs free for one year\n\nGot home from work to see the second half. Best 45 minutes of football I've watched in a long time. That was just mental. Great job Turkey and Georgia, brilliant entertainment.\n\nBoth teams played good football. No boring moment.\n\nI watched this in a Georgian bar in London. The staff and regulars were jumping about the entire time. Great fun!\n\nThey lost, but they gave their all in a good way. They have the right to be happy.\n\nThey came out of that match having given their all, with their heads high and probably a lot more fans!\n\nThis is the answer for why we England fans are unhappy with winning 1-0. Farting around with Southgate Ball may be tactically sound in tournament football but the game is ultimately a spectator sport. Turkey and Georgia displayed so much heart and energy and I know I'll never see England play like either\n\nThis is the reason Southgate should leave after this tournament.¬†\n\nI don‚Äôt mind getting results playing boring football tbh. I think the real issue is that we weren‚Äôt in control for longer than 30 minutes. Against a top team, we‚Äôd get destroyed. If we had the same result against a team like Germany playing cautious football, I‚Äôd be ecstatic. But it‚Äôs Serbia, who shouldn‚Äôt have been as dangerous as they were.\n\nIt‚Äôs only Mitrovic and Vlahovic right? üôÑ\n\nIt‚Äôs only Mitrovic and Vlahovic right? üôÑ\n\nWhy tf do I always miss out on these kinda  games üò≠\n\nI look at the teams and be like nah I'mma skip this and sit through the borefest that England conjures up (because England) and later regret watching matches like these after reading the comments. Same for the Romania game..\n\nI'm on the pilgrim to watch every match in this euro, you can always watch the re-run of the full game (I'm gonna DM you the link), in my timezone watching 3 group games from 8pm tp 4am will literally kill me lol. Sometime the games between \"weak\" sides can surprise you.\n\nWill appreciate that. Thank you!\n\nSame, I couldn't watch bc I'm at work\n\nThat‚Äôs why I put on everything in the background ‚Ä¶I tune in just in case‚Äô\n\nG√ºler is really that good, that goal of his might be the best we‚Äôll see all tournament.\n\nIt was a great goal but it wasn‚Äôt even the best goal in the match. That volley was great!\n\nThis\n\nYeah,just the courage to take the shot. It made me immediately google Beckham's half field goal against Wimbledon.\n\nMate it wasn‚Äôt even the best goal of the game what are you saying!\n\nI thought it was better than the volley\n\nPlayed that game like it was a knockout game. Absolute banger.\n\nIts always the EURO-Games of the ‚Äûsmaller‚Äú Nations where you see the most beautiful Goals\n\nrough game for Georgia, they played a lot closer to Turkey in skill than you‚Äôd expect or the score line suggests. Turkey did a really good job of shutting Kvara down in defense to prevent him from being too present, in turn. \n\nconsidering how off-game both Portugal and Czechia looked, I think it‚Äôs def possible for Georgia to snag a cheeky third place quali to the round of 16\n\nUp there with Germany game and Romania performance but ya just a great game of footy some bangers too\n\nReally fun, and for me, really stressful üòÇüòÇüòÇ\n\nBut all the respect to Georgia, they were really good.\n\nI expected a draw before the match\n\nAnd: ARDAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\n\nThe Turkish barbers and Turkish grocery store went wild\n\nGreat fun.  Really enjoyed it.\n\nwow. the exact game that i miss. damn the highlight was good too\n\nIt felt like a knockout game, not their first group game.\n\nAmazing game.\n\n2 best goals of the tournament.....so far\n\nGood old bigger team winning games, smaller team winning hearts.\n\nMost entertaining game so far\n\nDon't care anything about either of those teams one way or another, but I absolutely loved watching those two going all in on trying to win the first match of the group stages in an absolutely mad, end-to-end thriller.  Fantastic football. \n\nOn a side note, it seems like there has been a surprisingly high percentage of the matches so far that have been really fantastic.  Hope it keeps up.\n\nI thought it was gonna be a slog, but that was fantastic. That Arda Guler goal might already have locked up goal of the tournament\n\nlol the volley was better\n\nBrilliant game. Both teams gave it all. The scoreline of 3-1 doesn't do justice. My gf is not an avid watcher but she mentioned that this was one of the best games she has ever watched. It was the right amount of tactics with passion, grit and determination by both teams. An absolute battlefield. \n\nTurkey's passion and individual and tactical brilliance. Georgia's never give up attitude and giving it all till last. It was entertaining to watch. What a game!\n\nLove me some Arda Guler wonder goals\n\nRM is stacked with him as a bench player\n\nDoes anybody have a link for the highlights? It's so hard to find them on YT.\n\nEdit: posted thrice, sorry. Deleted copied replies.\n\nWhere abouts are you?\n\nTurkey and eurocups. Always fun stuff.\n\nThank you for erasing Turkey euro 2020 run memories from my mind\n\nI loved that game\n\nAs a Turkish spectator, it was very fun and stressful at the same time. 2 crazy goals, last minute post then goal line clearance then a turnover winner... Insane game.\n\nLovely game! The best game of the Euros so far.\n\nGame of the tournament so far\n\nYou must have never watched a Stanley Cup final game?\n\nhaha jokes.. but i do agree that Turkey v Georgia game was exciting to watch. Gotta give Georgia credit.. they played their hearts out\n\nI wonder if there are usa citizens in this sub\n\nIt's a soccerball extravaganza!\n\nwhy do you wonder?\n\nJust curious i respect usa citizens who watch football because is not that popular i think but i might be wrong\n\nDid you see the Snicker‚Ñ¢Ô∏è goal of the game?\n\nNo tactics, just vibes. \n\nGeorgia were tremendous. Underdogs? Nah they're here to play.\n\ni guess 3:1 i i won 250 on tipico guys\n\nAlmost ruined by the useless trinket\n\nIt was torrential rain in Dortmund and my train there had been cancelled/delayed/redirected five times during the day.  Got soaked on the way to the ground but so glad I went!\n\nEnd to end, lots of skill from both teams, two excellent shots, missed chances, amazing atmosphere in the stadium and so loud, no queues for beer - it had it all!\n\nThe advantage of having 90% of the fans as Muslim = no beer queues!\n\nUnfortunately it wasn‚Äôt on US TV so I missed it\n\nTurkey never disappoints.  Always great to watch.\n\nThen here‚Äôs me working afternoon shift. I am missing every single game this week\n\nLittle bit of current geopolitics &amp; a lot of spicy historical interactions thrown in always livens up a footie match.üò¨\n\nI was at the edge of my seat. It really was a great game\n\nexactly\n\nOne of the best games of football ever at a tournement. Both teams went for it. Exciting stuff start to finish. Loved it\n\nYeah, if you like games without midfielders.\n\nWith the wrong outcome, though\n\nSo far, it's one of the most entertaining matches in this tournament.¬†\n\nAnd its beautiful to see the Turks and Georgians compete like that.\n\nThat first 20mins alone had more action than most football matches. Fantastic match. The beautiful game\n\nGreat game but it wasn‚Äôt better than the WC final ffs\n\nDid you guys see Bosnia üòç? Great performance. Oh shit, we don't even compete in Eurosüòî\n\nAnd what do we call Wales ? Gwalia, Gymru, Cymru ?\n\nSuch a fast paced game. The game did not stop until 75th minute. I believe that‚Äôs when someone stepped on Muldur‚Äôs leg. Georgia was in the game and had chances for the draw until 96th. So many opportunities for drama in this game. Definitely a very fun game to watch.\n\nHas there be en a better game in the tournament so far?\n\nI didnt watch this matvh, now i feel sad\n\nCan anyone help me get a free streaming site for Euro 24 that's NOT in Russian commentary and is always glitching ! I'm going crazy here in Canada...\n\nI thought that match would be kinda boring but my God I was wrong. Arda Guller is such a beast for scoring that important goal at only 19, well deserved win for Turkey. Probably the best or second best game on Euro.\n\nTake note England! üè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å•Û†ÅÆÛ†ÅßÛ†Åø\n\n[deleted]\n\nLoll no Turkey had the upper hand clearly, stop hating and just enjoy both teams\n\n[deleted]\n\nShush weird kid\n\nGeorgia fanboy spotted,instead of being happy your team played well,you're busy bashing the enemy team.. Cmon grow up\n\n[removed]\n\n[deleted]\n\nlame hahahaha you should watch baseball lol\n\n[deleted]\n\nOh, come.on... i havent watched the match, but it it baseball more interesting that a match where you have someone claiming itnwas the most entertaining match of the Euro thus far?\n\nFck, even i.get more entertained of watching paint dry than enduring a baseball match üòä\n\nIt is normal to not interesting for you. Because you dont understand football\n\n[removed]\n\nstay away \"ad hominem\" and improve your football\n\nNo, it‚Äôll not.\n\n[removed]\n\nGeneralazing 90mio nation; wow.\n\nLMAOO CRY MORE. GIVE KVARA THE SHOULD‚ÄôVE‚ÄôDOR\n\nEven better than the world cup final? Are you high? Recency bias is crazy\n\nWorld cup final was dead until Mbappe scored for 2-2 and then stayed dead until pens lol\n\n[deleted]\n\nMorocco's run is miles more memorable than all of that. Probably what people will be mentioning first when qatar will be brought up 10 years from now.\n\nMate pipe down. Morocco run was commendable but everyone remembers the winner üòÇ\n\nOf course everyone will. Theyll be mentioned second.\n\nif someone translates this into english id be keen to read it!\n\nThe whole wcup is blank for me, even though I watched the final. I just remember Salt Bae taking up all the spotlight at the endü§¢ü§Æ A fitting end to a filthy cup\n\nAnd thus we shall never speak of World Cup 2022 ever again for all of mankind\n\nHaha, I may go to far,but thats my view I really couldn't enjoy that wcup. Also that it was in the winter didn't help..\n\nI hated it, exactly these tournaments are traditionally summer and they move it to winter? No thank you. As soon as that tournament was over, I instantly forgot about it. Was delighted for messi but the atmosphere at games felt so forced and false whereas this is true and I have felt it every game. The Germans put on a great tournament in 2006 and they are doing it again üá©üá™\n\nYea fake is the word, would've been much nicer if for example Turkey had hosted it as a middle eastern country, or maybe Morrocco, or maybe not, but it would've been genuine¬† anyway.¬†\n\n\nAlways with the germansüëç\n\nYessss I was thinking turkey too. They have the infrastructure to host a World Cup. They‚Äôre going to host the euros in 2032 with Italy so we have that to look forward to üòÉ\n\nTurkey with Italy? What a fucked up concept! Why not just give it to either one,?:)\n\nI‚Äôm talking generally. The World Cup before 80 minutes was pretty much just one way, but I‚Äôll agree the end of that match will likely never be topped ever\n\nmate than you missed the whole AFCON ( Some of the Asian cup games where also bangers especially Qat vs Irn)\n\nLeast delusional Turk:\n\nI‚Äôm English lmao\n\nnot better than wc final be for real\n\nCorrupt referee\n\nüßÇ\n\nI donr give a fuck about Portugal. But that shit was criminal\n\nmy love for the little prince arda had only exploded for him. i always always believed in him broooooo\n\nTbh i found the France game alot more fun to watch. Turkey vs Georgia was Hella nerfwrecking if you are a fan for one of the sides probably. But for me the game wasnt as good as op says it was (still good)\n\nYou mean Germany B v Russian B? derby time!\n\nFuck off\n\neat my D\n\nAre u from Russia C?"

Don't you know it's just days before you have to go to work.\n\nHad 4 Guinness last night after dinner,heads thumping in work today I can‚Äôt comment on anything Rashford does or doesn‚Äôt do\n\n4 naan, Jeremy? ¬†Four?\n\nthat‚Äôs insane\n\nTeach me, bro.\n\nThe Glazers must be getting kickbacks from these player contracts or something.\n\nValid but once the kickoff whistle blows...\n\nlol‚Ä¶ Hi\n\nHow dare you sleep in on your day OFF. I‚Äôm outraged\n\nI get your point but flying to America is a wee bit different from pub on a friday\n\nWhy does it matter as long as he‚Äôs back before work?\n\nI'll try to find the study but I read that air travel can have a profound impact on players sleep quality, musculature and their recuperation after training hard, with the side effects being both temporary and accumulative over time.  All of it hurts their performance.  Also makes them more susceptible to injuries.\n\nEverybody can get groggy and sleep deprived on long flights, but the effects seem to be worse for pro athletes.  Which makes sense - an average person would feel totally exhausted after traveling long distance and then running a 10K (6.2 miles) a day or two after.  They would probably need a few days to recover.\n\nPremier League footballers run an average of that distance every match.  That's not counting training.  If they're in other competitions, it becomes them essentially running a 10K every 3-4 days while pulling, shoving and tackling other incredibly fit grown men kicking a ball around for over 1.5 - 2 hours, as a tactical chess match goes on in their heads.  I'm getting tired just thinking about it.\n\nEdit:  \n\n[Multiple Academic White Papers](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25946072/)\n\n[FIFPro - 10 Year Drake Football Study](https://fifpro.org/en/supporting-players/health-and-performance/drake-football-study/how-does-travel-fatigue-and-jet-lag-affect-footballers)\n\nMaybe they should stop having international breaks every 3 weeks and 8 match champions league group stages if air travel is so bad\n\nI get your point, but most of those games are at the most two hours away timezone. The jetlag gets progressively worse when the time difference grows larger.\n\nWhat you‚Äôre saying is right but more than anything it‚Äôs not the travel- it‚Äôs the fact he wanted to go in the first place. His mind should be completely on getting back to the top level\n\n100% agreed.\n\nHe will be travelling in 1st class, probably slept ok\n\nThe international break didn‚Äôt just see UEFA Nations League games. There were internationals all over the world, including Africa Cup of Nations and World Cup qualifiers in The Americas and Asia.\n\nFor example, Coventry played today at 12:30 with a player that played in the US-Jamaica game on Tuesday.\n\nWhy on earth is this downvoted\n\nSturridge quit football because a 4 hour trip flight for a away game was too much for his body.\n\nPlease find that study\n\nEdited to include what I found.\n\nuppity dolls puzzled memorize vanish retire disarm fly resolute advise\n\n *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev/home)*\n\nYea, conditions like days off.\n\nadjoining somber wakeful bells fly squash badge ossified ghost dime\n\n *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev/home)*\n\nOh you‚Äôre one of them..\n\nNope., better to dress like that as it winds up little fragile gimps.\n\nThe conditions are being one of the best at the most popular sport in the world.\n\nAnd not sitting at home 24/7 until you have training or a match.\n\nOtherwise i would have been a pro aswell and would also happily sit 24/7 at home for that amount of money\n\nmindless simplistic live wine vegetable handle steep provide growth zephyr\n\n *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev/home)*\n\nHe plays in the best league in the world. Which makes him one of the best yes.\n\nBy playing in a top5 league you are already one of the best in the world.\n\nDo you suggest he‚Äôs not allowed to go abroad at all?\n\nBut it's also the fact people are comparing it to the pub on a Friday \nIt's Vegas. He's likely out there having a drink .\n\nPlus it's a new coach in and he's been rubbish so he should be doing everything behind the scenes to work hard and no been seen out spending money he being overpayed.\n\nIt‚Äôs not vegas lol\n\nIt‚Äôs unprofessional. Genuine athletes don‚Äôt get ‚Äòdays off‚Äô. They have days when they aren‚Äôt on tv but to be at the top level you it‚Äôs a full time life style. Hence why SAF didn‚Äôt agree with partying and quickly got rid of bad eggs and influences. Even a weird haircut was enough to send you packing back then. I know times move on but we need players with complete dedication to the club!\n\nHe went to a basketball game. Maybe if the headline was Rashford sinks 15 pints a bag of Charlie and a greasy donner then you might have a point\n\nThere gotta be some benefits to being rich i guess‚Ä¶\n\nHave you never done a weekend trip to another country?\nIt‚Äòs the same thing, he‚Äòs just rich enough to do it in a private jet and fly to the USA\n\nWith Rashford‚Äôs money it‚Äôs probably a more relaxing experience than a night at the pub would be.\n\nspotted cows gullible nutty lavish waiting sugar tease murky offbeat\n\n *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev/home)*\n\nJetlag can impact you mentally and physically for days. When you are a day away from having your first training with the manager you dont prioritize looking gangster on a basketmatch IF there is a possibility that it can affect you.\n\nBut it may also allow you to escape from the pressures of being a professional sports person, to recharge the batteries. \n\nUltimately he has made the decision to do this. Maybe he was approved by the club, maybe not, maybe they don‚Äôt care. \n\nBut if he plays shit then I would like to think he is benched. However, just hope he finds form and stays consistent with it.\n\nIt‚Äôs mid season. Any player with sense, in his position when underperforming constantly would be to train and be focused on his job. He‚Äôs not. He‚Äôs travelling to America, not training and returning jet lagged. Guys a sap.\n\nPub on a Friday isn‚Äôt really the same it‚Äôs more like flying to America on Friday and then coming to work Monday, the jet lack will effect his performance. Blokes on ¬£300k a week you think he‚Äôd try and act professional and look after himself\n\nYeh fair, but he's also being paid an absurd wage and putting in such shite performances. If an employee was severely underperforming and instead of spending their free time trying to get better or catching up on their work, they slacked off even more, you'd berate them too.\n\nWhat you do in your downtime is a wee bit different than what a professional athlete should be doing in their downtime. Especially when they‚Äôve been poor at their job for 18+ months.\n\nCan say the same for politicians really but they still face scrutiny for aspects about their personal life or actions on their days off. \n\nThe reality is that certain jobs have expectations far more than \"regular\" jobs and a job where you earn ¬£300k a week is clearly going to have different expectations.\n\n‚ÄúEmployed man uses his free time to go watch sports‚Äù \n\n\nWhy are you sharing these shitty nonsense articles? \n\nI feel like people should have to give an abstract if they share anything, the drivel people post to get a few likes.\n\nIt's a race thing. If Foden did this the headline would be \"Foden Rests Up in America Before Practice Begins\"\n\nIn before they call you a race baiter, victim or one of those other gammon phrases\n\nExpectations are different when you are being paid  tens of millions to do your job. That is hardly shocking\n\nYou are joking right? You think the highest paid in society are held the most accountable? If only. \n\nYou are dreaming. It‚Äôs very much the opposite‚Ä¶\n\nI mean... as a fan... you are allowed to hold them accountable if you want.\n\nYes, of course‚Ä¶ if they have done something wrong. \n\nBut based off this nonsense article, what has he done wrong? \n\nI‚Äôm not out here defending Marcus Rashford, (other than in principle), but calling out this shitty journalism that gets shared in this sub all the time.\n\nHes been shite for a season and a half and this has the appearance of not putting his best foot forward.\n\nYou have to be diagnosed\n\n[deleted]\n\nThe expectation is that a team leader who has already been disciplined for failure to meet team standards put himself in the best physical position possible to be ready to play. \n\nSpending 12 hours on plane and doing a double adjustment to time differences puts massive strain on your body all in order to go watch a basketball game and party it up in NY.\n\nWould I react the same if the story was ‚Äúrashford was seen at home‚Äù\n\nlol no I wouldn‚Äôt and if you can‚Äôt figure out why then you are about as smart as Rashford was being here.\n\nTraveling between the US and Europe is also not physically easy. Especially the flight from the US to Europe gives you severe jet lag, that can take days to fully recover from.\n\nIt‚Äôs New York it‚Äôs not difficult\n\nIs it noticeably difficult? Not particularly. Does it still fuck up your sleep schedule? Yes. \n\nHe‚Äôs a professional athlete. It will affect his performance on some level.\n\nIts a 5 hour flight switching between time zones. It sure as shit isn‚Äôt easy.\n\nIt‚Äôs 7 hours to Barcelona. \n\nI guess maybe it‚Äôs shorter to Manchester, but the time zone is the same.\n\nHigh performance athlete who hasn‚Äôt been performing for a long time uses free time to engage in activity that won‚Äôt help him improve his performance.\n\nIt‚Äôs fine he can do that, but expect him to be part of a clear out soon, given he isn‚Äôt remotely value for money.\n\nWhat a stupid take. \n\nHis wage is the clubs problem created by the club, not him. Could he do more to improve his on field performance? Maybe, we don‚Äôt know enough about what goes on behind closed doors.\n\nShoud he train on his days off also? Are you a personal trainer? Are you a sports psychologist? Do you work with Marcus Rashford?\n\nAre you Marcus rashford or something? \n\nA stupid take is not realising squeezing a long haul flight into a small window of downtime isn‚Äôt exactly going to help your performances. It‚Äôs maybe a luxury you can afford if you‚Äôre performing but it‚Äôs bad optics given his performances over the last couple of years.\n\nHe has a choice, absolutely he can squeeze in a holiday playing the celebrity in America with a very small amount of downtime  and continue to coast by with bad performances. But the club also has a choice, they can give up on him and spend the time and money on someone else more worthy. \n\nHis current career trajectory is he‚Äôll be at a team in Saudi, a bottom of the table prem club or some average Italian team in a couple of seasons and no one will really miss him. Hope he doesn‚Äôt regret those decisions.\n\nI am not Marcus Rashford, I am a United fan who is as baffled and frustrated at his dip in form as many others. Or maybe it wasn‚Äôt a dip, and this is his level and he‚Äôs had a few golden patches here and there. I don‚Äôt know. And if he left I‚Äôd be quite happy to have that wage bill removed. \n\nIt doesn‚Äôt mean I can‚Äôt also look at something like this for what it is and call out shitty predatory ‚Äòjournalism‚Äô when it is created to spin his actions in a negative light from the start because it gets clicks.\n\nHere's the biggest award of the most stupid take on reddit for 2024. Congratulations.\n\n[deleted]\n\nYes. No. Maybe. We don‚Äôt know that he‚Äôs doing the ‚Äòbare minimum‚Äô, we literally don‚Äôt have that information.\n\nHow are people still missing my point? It‚Äôs about the shocking state of crappy internet articles that get shared on the football subs, not about what Marcus Rashford does or doesn‚Äôt need to do to regain form. \n\nIt‚Äôs really simple.\n\nUsually players dont get call from their national teams have 4 5 days vacation time. Any player can travel at their free times. Ugarte will be back from uruguay way late.\n\nPeople really like these type of bullshit.\n\nYeah this is overblown. He doesn‚Äôt have to just be sitting in a dark room contemplating his every United mistake when he has holiday time. Let him go on holiday in peace\n\nHe's got fans on social media who do that for him\n\nHe‚Äôll probably come back better after a few days break whilst putting in some work\n\nNo. However, get in the gym. On the pitch practising. It‚Äôs bad optics when the perception is you are over paid and under delivering.\n\nbeing on the pitch while on vacation probably defeats the purpose.\n\nDefeats the purpose playing lazy on field tbh. He used to play with passion. Plays like a guy that flys to and from New York watching NBA‚Ä¶‚Ä¶\n\nYou seem entirely too invested in what another man does with his vacation time.\n\nHe was literally training while over there ya cretin\n\nCretin for politely suggesting that millions paid per year footballer who once played brilliantly however seemingly since leaning into the celeb lifestyle culture has lost form should focus back on form to get back to his levels he once was at???\n\nNo cretin for speaking shit instead of actually knowing what ur on about. Casemiro was in the same place doing the same stuff not a word about him anywhere\n\nWhy is he on holiday when the rest of the non-national team players are practicing with the new coach?\n\nHe arrived for the start of training with every other player. Training started on Monday which he was there for, Amorim wasn't even allowed to start coaching us until then and the only players in last week were the ones recovering from injury or the academy.\n\nMy only possible concern is jet lag.\n\nBut as you mentioned, internationals for COMNEBOL or CONCACAF teams have to deal with that every international break, so I'm sure teams have way to deal with that.\n\nJet lag from NYC isn't even that bad. It's only a 5 hour difference\n\nJet lag is what plebs get.  Man is flying with a bed, Michelin grade food and service, and no crying babies. Jet lag? Fuck off\n\nMeanwhile last International break, Harry Souttar flew from the UK to Adelaide, played a match, then flew to Japan and played again, then flew home and played for Sheff Utd and put in a good performance. \n  \nHe'll have been in 1st class getting some decent rest for sure.\n\nI still get jet lag with all that on the way back west.\n\nFootball players have an insomnia crisis anyway basically all their sleep schedules are constantly fucked. Jet lag is probably minor in comparison to their near constant sleeping issues\n\nIn fairness though why is he not one of the first names on the England team sheet? He‚Äôs got all the ability in the world, but as many instances have proven in the last two years for some reason his attitude falters and I can only think that‚Äôs one of the main reasons he had such a poor season last year compared to two years ago. Even that mega season he was benched for being late to training, and I can‚Äôt remember if the night out in Belfast was last season or that one. He goes completely missing on the field and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve seen anyone come out and say that he‚Äôs first to training and last to leave kind of thing\n\nIt is not about it. There is a report blaming him for a completely normal thing. You can say he is a disappointment, he is not ambitios or hardworker. But it will not be about he travelling at his free time.\n\nNo I‚Äôm not saying this is, I‚Äôm just saying it‚Äôs a shambles that he‚Äôs even free during an England weekend because on paper he should be on the plane every time, but I don‚Äôt even think he made the Euros squad this year and it seems to be his own fault\n\nHe's not on of the first names on the England team sheet because he's shite, and there are probably 5 players at least who are better than him in his position.\n\nHad one decent season, not amazing, in 7-8 seasons. Bang average.\n\nYep, there's some serious reinventing history when it comes to his career. Mostly very average for a Premier League forward, with the odd good spell thrown in - a long time ago now. He's very much part of why United find themselves where they are now.\n\n[deleted]\n\nSo posting training pictures at his free time also dont work.\n\nWhat attitude are you talking about? It‚Äôs his free time, he doesn‚Äôt owe it to anyone. He can and should do whatever he wants in his own time\n\nHe's fighting first class or private.  He's not sitting in seat 44B\n\nYou think first class passengers are immune from jet lag?\n\nJet lag can be slept off or significantly lessened when you're not sitting on upright seats.\n\nIt's not a bad thing he spent his summer training and trying to get ready and be in better shape than last season. \n\nThe flights are a bit of a pain but I'm sure they've got the equipment to help with jetlag ect\n\n8 hour flights* and that was the closest to you being right in your entire comment.\n\n8 hour flights by private jet or first class. Definitely not the same as us lot being crammed in to economy üòÇ\n\nSo he can do what he likes, but then you proceed to tell us what he can't do, right?\n\nYour absolutely right! I mean surely he should be preparing for a new manager coming in\n\nCompletely disagree. Now is not the time for vacation. If you want to be a top professional, you don‚Äôt go on vacation when you and your team are struggling. You train, you lead by example, you grind. This long distance vacation is a clear sign of a player who has lost his focus and dedication to his craft.\n\nVacation can help a player to focus again. Vacation being long distance is not matter. This guys doesnt travel like regular people. There is no team training in 4-5 days, posting training pictures to instagram is not being an example. It is for fans.\n\nProfessionals are still human. Ok for them to go on a break on a day off. Unless that's wrong to you.\n\nIt‚Äôs ok, sure. Not saying he should be fired. But it‚Äôs not something a player who aspires to greatness would do.\n\nThe press knows exactly why they are doing. They didn't release the images of him recently spotted in Schools. I wonder why?\n\nI'm no fan of Rashford but the agenda is obvious.\n\nIf you look at the replies here, you can understand who the article was written for, awful fanbase, zero class. Ego of Real Madrid and achievements of Arsenal\n\nEntire thread is saying the article is stupid\n\nReading comprehension of Chelsea\n\nReading comprehension of Adolin*\n\nI absolutely love how popular stormlight is getting\n\nHahahaha it‚Äôs incredible isn‚Äôt it, still praying for a good tv/movie adaptation\n\nRashford was training I believe 2 days after he went to that basketball game. Has played every game so far so is clearly fit. \n\nCasemiro also went to an NBA game but isn't as much of a lightning rod for mouth breathers.\n\nThese threads are great because the real knuckle draggers in the UK come out in force. The same people bitching barely show up to their job stocking shelves because they are too hung over and bitch because this guy who‚Äôs worked his ass off to get where he is is traveling to a game in his extended day off. \n\nMaybe direct your anger at your shitty employer for your current situation, not Rashford.\n\nNot just people in the UK who comment on this though, plenty of global knuckledraggers\n\nBreaking news - man has social life outside of work and attends basketball match with his friend and coworker, only one is criticised for it\n\nAnd?\n\nOf all the things to criticize Rashford for, him being an employee using his free time to do something he wants to do is not one of them.\n\nNone of this bothers me apart from the fact he's dressed like a complete bell end.\n\nWhy does another man dressing a certain way bother you?\n\nWhy do feelings bother you\n\nWhy do thoughts confuse you?\n\nNeeds selling ASAP\n\nJust look at this drip, this guy's head is empty. He played for a new contract and downed his tools afterwards.\n\nThe classic \"guy wears expensive clothes so he must not care about football\" argument being used again. \n\nIf I was on 200k a week I wouldn't buy anything expensive because I would be at training every waking moment between a match's end and the start of the next. ü§ìü§ìü§ì \n\nLive in the real world.\n\nMaybe focus on the things that Rashford actually does and says to decide what's going on inside his head.\n\nBecause his activity for charities and advocacy for the vulnerable people of society makes me think his head is not in fact 'empty'.\n\nBut he wore an outfit you don't like, so he must be a moron!\n\nHe's trying to be something he's not and it's really strange. You hear him talk and he's soft spoken and seems introspective but then dresses like he wants all the eyes on him and the attention.. he doesn't even play like he has that sort of attitude\n\nEhh if you look at the photo of him watching the game he's just in a black tee and jeans + jewellery.   \nSo he bought a fun bright coloured LV jacket - who cares?\n\nI clicked on that cancerous source upon reading your comment and... what the fuck? \n\nHe looks like a cartoon character, lol.\n\nRacist dog whistle.\n\nWhat the fucking fuck is he wearing. I get dressin out when sitting courtside as an athlete of another sport but that shit looks straight out of Ali G‚Äôs closet.\n\nFashion\n\nMe Julie\n\nI don‚Äôt get why United fans are angry their club is already out of the title race.\n\nYou think they'll be happy when they just had a new manager.\n\nDaily Racist Mail\n\nFuck the daily mail, the sun, the daily star, the telegraph, fuck the lot of yous\n\nGary Neville is a tedious wanker who can‚Äôt hide his disdain of anything related to United. He‚Äôs the worst one on stick to football too\n\nIt was basketball game not a bloody nightclub in Belfast\n\nI mean I get why this rattles people. When you are struggling, sometimes you need to get your head down and grind it out to get back in your groove.\n\nBut sometimes you need to step back for a couple of days, reset, and hit it with a clear head. \n\nNobody performs better or improves at anything when they are burnt out.\n\nWhat a time to be alive when as a Knicks/United fan, I‚Äôm concerned about he Red Devils rubbing off on the Knicks and not the other way around.\n\nPlayer who has been shite for a long, long time? New manager just started?\n\n\nAnybody with an ounce of character would be determined to start the new regime as strongly as possible, to make the best impression possible on what should be his last chance at United.¬†\n\n\nBut character is the last thing I expect from Rashford and I have zero surprise that he clearly couldn't give a toss about making a good impression for a new manager.\n\nJorginho from Arsenal was in NYC with his girlfriend. Cancel him!\n\nIf he's free for a couple days he can so whatever he wants.\nBut him playing badly is true though.\n\nbro is a damn average English player of colour.\n\noverhyped....\n\nWhen I first saw the picture I thought it was 21 Savage\n\nQuote is from Gary Neville, had they mentioned that in the headline I would have ignored it\n\nSaid it before and I‚Äôll say it again.\n\nThese players are unfit for the jersey.\n\nOh look, daily star has a new Reddit account¬†\n\nNon story\n\nNot based on this - but just because he's been absolutely shite for at least 2 years now - one of the first  things the new boss needs to do is take whatever money a club offers and run. He's been one of the constants in United's rapid downward trajectory. I'm amazed some people still think he's any good, it's baffling.\n\nNeville is talking shite and is OTT but sooner United get rid of Rashford and a few more wasters the better.\n\nCoasting along doing fuck all .\n\nThere‚Äôs a lot of superfluous information here. Marcus Rashford is shit. The story ends there.\n\nIf United were a proper football club, they would have gotten rid of this freeloading trash player years ago. They're not. Proper banter club. Spurs of the North.\n\nBang average. Utd should sell but he's on extortionate wages, nobody's going to touch them. Unless you do a sancho.\n\nThese players do have a personal life but paparazzi keeps ruining it\n\nOh, bloody! Imagine going out on free time. Oh my!\n\nVacation? Oh didn‚Äôt know that it‚Äôs already off season.\n\nYou can do whatever the fuck that you want, but not with season still going on. You played like Anichebe but still wants a vacation to US. Geez.\n\nLa galaxy move incoming\n\n‚ÄúPlayer has weekend ~ proceeds to use weekend to have a weekend‚Äù\n\nEnd of day it is his day off. Who are we to say what he cannot do on his day off?\n\nFuck the Daily Mail and their shitty agendas\n\nI believe you need to get clearance from the club approved first before heading out for international travel.  So this criticism is a non-issue when management approved the trip.\n\nThis ship isn't right'n\n\nMan can‚Äôt even have a day off\n\nWTF is this titel, or is my Swedish brain not wired enough to understand this?\n\nGary and Roy are incredible dumb\n\nHad so much potential, but now looks like a wasted talent\n\nHow many \"days before\"?.\n\nLot of you need to chill.\n\nNo skiing holiday for you you might break a leg.\n\nDon't employ women, they might get pregnant.\n\nNot at work?,bye bye I'm off to ..........\n\nrough\n\nWe really love to scapegoat at Utd and it‚Äôs easy to target Rashford when he‚Äôs actually a very good lad having met him in Manchester Selfridges once. Really took the time to chat with my kids and answer all their crazy questions. Kind and courteous, not the lazy and unprofessional guy that some critics would paint him as when it‚Äôs not just one simple reason the team is failing¬†\n\nAs a united supporter id rather we have bunch of cunts who keep winning titles instead of bunch of good lads fannying around.¬†\n\nNeville again, of course.\n\nWhy is nobody commenting on his fashion style?   \nThe more money you make, the worst you look?  \nLike what are those chains and him doing sings with his hands trying to get attention?  \nEverything just shouts insecurity. Lack of self esteem and poor identity.  \nHe doesn't think he is a football player, he thinks he is a rapper.\n\nSuch a poser\n\nWell his fashion sense is as bad as his work rate.\n\nFuck he looks ridiculous.\n\nThe kid is garbage\n\nI‚Äôm not an elite sportsperson, but I‚Äôve never found that travel to the United States has any detrimental physical effects on me.\n\nNeville‚Äôs such a click-bait loudmouth! Why does anyone think footballers aren‚Äôt just normal human being really, everyone else gets annual leave to go away, spend time with family etc‚Ä¶ why does anyone footballers get balled out for doing the same?\n\nCouldnt care less if he‚Äôs taking a break. More concerned at the outfit. Grown man that. Looked an absolute cunt.\n\nSmart man\n\nCasemiro went on holiday and to a basketball game with his wife. \n\nMarcus Rashford went to a basketball game with an entourage so big that needed a minibus and looked absolutely out of his head on something.\n\nRemember when the whole United fanbase Gaslight the entire footballing world that Ronaldo was holding this guy back?\n\nHe‚Äôs got more money than he knows what to do with. Fly to New York and back in a few days? Why not?\n\nCould of told you that 2 seasons ago\n\nLoosing patience with Rashford,, he‚Äôs turning into Pogba, dressing &amp; just being a dick in general\n\nThis wouldn't be a problem if he was performing well for his employers. Pretty normal for players to do this but probably best to stay out of the limelight if you've been utterly shit .\n\nAlso Neville is an absolute wanker, proper dickhead in every regard ."

    "all_comment_text": "Crazy they're selling him for ¬£20million more than they paid for Haaland!\n\nThey paid haaland a massive signing bonus so the total amount city paid was like 85.5 million.\n\nAnd they paid a dad tax.\n\nDespite Roy Keane's protests.\n\nAnd a couple of his tackles too\n\nI‚Äôd add an extra 80m on top of that with under the table dealings as well. This is City we‚Äôre talking about.\n\nSource: I made it up\n\nCity are under investigation for 115 charges of financial fraud and signed one of the most sought after strikers in the world without any under the table dealings? Give your head a wobble mate.\n\nDidn't he have a release clause anybody could trigger? With that in mind why the fuck wouldn't he want to move to the CL contender?\n\n200 mil I think which could be triggered in 2024\n\nlol what are u smoking it was 80 million anyone could activate it, Barca and PSG both spoke to him about nothing but he didn‚Äôt want either, he wanted City lol\n\nI'm talking about the release clause in his City contract...\n\nWe were talking about his transfer to City. In which case his current release clause is irrelevant\n\nAs a Liverpool fan, I truly hope they are found guilty. As someone who realizes no matter how good City's lawyers are they probably would have been charged with something if they broke a black and white rule, I don't think we will see them found guilty of anything of note.\n\nYou find it mind blowing that one of the best teams in the world went out and signed on of the best players in the world‚Ä¶? Were you wearing your tinfoil hat when you typed all that up?\n\nHe is saying that City bought him for the price that all of the big clubs could pay. And he is right! Do you want to say that Real could not pay 60 million for him? Or Liverpool? Even Arsenal would gladly give the money. It was a HUGE under the table deal and i bet good money that it's one of the deals, that has triggered the investigation against City.\n\nOf course they could. But they didn‚Äôt. City has Pep and his dad played for the club. That‚Äôs more than enough to entice him. Also the prospect of being the man that finally brings the UCL to them. You can‚Äôt just scream ‚Äúfraud‚Äù with no proof outside of pathetic conspiracy theories like a little baby just because they signed him.\n\nAlso you need to count how much they're paying *him*.\n\n¬£375,000 per week. That‚Äôs what they are paying him.\n\nHe can choose to go wherever he likes - the money is the problem.\n\nThat's literally just false. You haven't followed any of this at all. It's not at all what the investigation is about.\n\nOf course those other teams could pay his release clause. He chose to come here. His dad played for us. He supported us a bit over the years growing up. We have pep and a fantastic squad. \n\nWhy would it have to be a huge under the table deal? What are you basing that off? Have you read the court documents? Do you know anything about this at all? Or do you just type whatever you want without any basis?\n\nNo one knows what the investigation is about. You need to stop looking at this not as a fan of the team and start thinking.\n\nWhat? They had an entire trial already. The prem investigation is basically a mirror of the EUFA one. You can read the entire set of evidence they had. We know what this investigation is about. The entire thing is available online for you to read.\n\nYou mean to tell me you've just been saying these other things you made up, and you have no idea what the investigation is about? Lol\n\nLol calm the fuck down. You are pulling shit out of your ass to fit your narrative. Typical\n\nAs you can see i am not the only one who thinks that way.\n\nLol. OK?\n\nYou're missing the most important fact; he was bought for ¬£54mill after having 3 world class seasons as a top 3 goalscorer in the world in his early 20s, in a market where his closest comparison in terms of age, position and goal scoring Mbapp√© cost over ¬£100mill at 18 years old after 1 good season and his teammate who wasn't as good as him cost ¬£72mill just 1 year earlier.\n\nNot to mention Harry Maguire cost ¬£80mill a few seasons before and Pepe was signed by Arsenal a few years before for ¬£72mill, to name a few players no where near as good, older who cost way more.\n\nNo chance there wasn't some more money paid to either Dortmund, Haaland's agent or Haaland's father/family. The only money reported was the ¬£54mill in order for City to not be in trouble for breaching FFP.\n\nDo you know how easy it would be for City to pay another ¬£54mill out of a business that they own, but aren't listed as the direct owners. Or even more secretive, in multiple small installments from multiple different businesses that they own where they aren't listed as the direct owners...\n\nYou could say that about literally any transfer where a player was sold for less than what they were worth. Again, no proof just conspiracy theories to cope\n\nCan't wait for Dortmund to face expulsion from the Bundesliga and a huge tax bill &amp; fine. The German Bundeszentralamt f√ºr Steuern (Tax Office) does not fuck around, they'd love to catch a Bundesliga club getting under the table payments. And if \"The most important fact\" in the case was \"I think he was worth more\" is so obvious to OGSkywalker97 a random reddit enjoyer, it must be doubly obvious to them to, no?\n\nThere's this beautiful concept commonly known as a release clause. Kindly look it up\n\nYes, but thats irrelevant here. OP was talking about fees paid to the club and the faft remains that its crazy that Alvarez is more expensive than Haaland\n\nBy that logic Mbappe wasn't free, but in excess of 100m.\n\nCrazy someone is buying for this much..crazier its atletico\n\nJulian alvarez is a great footballer. People propably dont realize just hpw good he is bc he played for a stacked city team.\n\nPlus he'll probably play for atleti for the next ten years.\n\n&gt;Crazy someone is buying for this much\n\nCan't understand this sentiment.\n\nIf players like Kuolo Muani, Antony, Mudryk have gone for 90+, why isn't Alvarez worth 95? \n\n  \nGon√ßalo Ramos went to PSG for 80 million.  \nRasmus Hollund went to United for 73.\n\nAlvarez is a peach of a player. Twice the player Antony is\n\nI would say thrice or more.\n\nBut I think under this circumstance, Alvarez publicly declared he wants to depart from\nMan City, which usually results in teams not meeting the higher end valuation in the transfer market. It‚Äôs difficult to demand top dollar when a player doesn‚Äôt want to be at your club anyway so I am surprised the managed to coup ¬£82M also imo\n\n&gt; It‚Äôs difficult to demand top dollar when a player doesn‚Äôt want to be at your club anyway\n\nDepends on how many clubs are interested in buying him right?\n\nWell yes and no. I would suspect that City would not let him go to another PL side. Which kind of only leave Real Madrid, PSG, Saudi league and (surprisingly) Athletico Madrid in the running. In my opinion if he wants to be a prolific goalscorer he would be better suited to a side like Napoli or even Atalanta but they don‚Äôt have the dinero for a player of such quality\n\nCity will let the players if they want to leave. But for that club should get the right money. They made it clear with Bernardo. He wanted to leave but 60M offer never came and look he is doing well. Also, Ederson wanted to leave but city pulled off since they didn't get the money they think should have. Same with buying players. They pulled off buying Van Dijk as they valued him worth 60M and Southampton wanted more. City making clear statement with all these deals helped them get money off Alverez.\n\nYou are wrong. They inflated the Van Dijk deal because they knew Liverpool wanted to buy him, not that he wasn‚Äôt worth being the biggest CB transfer in PL history. \n\nYour examples are poor because they demonstrate what my point is. \n\n1. When Mario Balotelli didn‚Äôt want to play for them anymore they sold him to AC Milan for ‚Ç¨20M and made a loss on him. \n\n\n2. When Carlos Tevez wanted out of Man City they sold him to Juventus for ‚Ç¨8M and made a loss on him \n\n\nI don‚Äôt get the structure of your argument by comparing a player like Bernardo who was past his prime and self by date for the PL\n\nYou just presenting your data what fits your agenda. Saying 29 year(currently) silva way past prime and bringing 29 year old Tevez wanting to leave in conversation. Also silva was linked to Barca move couple years ago if not 3 years ago which make he was in 26-27 when he linked move to Barca. \nAlso Balatoli situation was way worse. Coach didn't want him at club as well. \nAnd I brought those example of pep's time at city cause now club have taken more of strong shape and move with more of plans. City let Palmer, Sterling, Sane, Ferran torres... even they were or before prime cause right amount of money came and players wanted to move. And let players like Cancelo go if players is more of problem than a help.\n\n95 isn't that high for Alvarez. He could've gone for +100. Just look at the shit names I listed.\n\nI get that. I don‚Äôt know if you read my comment, it was more directed towards the fact that he already said he wants to leave\n\nNone of these players are worth these values\n\nYet the market said they were.\n\nAtletico fans in 3 years: hey how come we bankrupt\nAtletico president: the market said we had to pay that much ü´†\n\nSeems that clubs are keen on going \"bankrupt\", so it must be worth it. Every team except Madrid is paying these types of fees for this quality of players.\n\n95 for Alvarez is easily worth it.\n\nThe worth of the players is based on a team being willing to pay the price. It's not based on your opinion.\n\nBankrupcy is also based in financials, not on anyones opinion\n\nI'm pretty sure the guys in charge of Atletico's finances are more aware of Atletico's finances than you.\n\nAs long as you are sure\n\ninflation?\n\nYeah but they went to PSG, Man U and Chelsea respectively; the 3 teams that most consistently overpay for players they want and other teams know they will pay way above the odds.\n\nAtletico are no where near as wealthy as those 3 clubs and are known for not budging on what they value the player at and rarely spend big other than Joao Felix. They also sold Ag√ºero to City for a very fair price who ended up becoming their top goalscorer and winning their first ever Premier League title in the last minute of the last day. \n\nI can definitely see why Atletico would pay ¬£80mill  for the same player that would cost Man U, PSG or Chelsea ¬£150mill.\n\nCompared to Felix, this is a bargain for Atletico\n\nThats for sure\n\nThey have made sooo much money selling world class strikers that they have developed over the years such as Torres, Ag√ºero, Falcao, Forlan etc. that it's not surprising that they would spend ¬£80mill on a top striker who wants to leave his club and can't get game time, especially considering Alvarez is like an Ag√ºero regen except better at pressing and defending.\n\nThey spent over ¬£100mill on an 18 year old Joao Felix remember?\n\nI mean, he starts over Lautaro for Argentina atm, and Lautaro may well get 3rd in Ballon d'Or rankings. I could've seen a higher prize for √Ålvarez too.\n\nthey love unnecessarily expensive transfers\n\nHe had release clause. If Borussia were asking 130 mil we would gladly pay that much.\n\nHaaland was worth every penny\n\nI am well aware.\n\nHe had a release clause\n\nIndeed he did.\n\nSeriously, how they were able to get this deal done needs to be studied.¬†\n\nThis is highly suspicious.. where‚Äôs athletico getting cash like that? City could easily be doing a cheeky transfer of half the funds back just to make their books look green\n\nAlvarez was a nice business by ManCity.\n\nHe backed up Haaland so well. Covered for ManCity in absence of Haaland. They got him at very low price &amp; now selling him at high price. Profit on all fronts.\n\nWaiting to see whom ManCity hires as his replacement.\n\nAs a Utd fan, he is the only city player that I‚Äôd take in an instant without getting that bitter aftertaste that he was a city player. Hopefully you get what I mean\n\nNot sure if United fans would actually  have anything other than a feeling of pure ecstacy and a constant boner if they took any of City's current best players\n\nYes. But the rest of the City players are boners you get whilst reading out a presentation. Having a boner is a nice feeling but not in that instance. Alvarez is a boner you get whilst home alone.\n\nAh, I see you know your boners well\n\nI‚Äôm quite experienced in the field\n\nWhat in the fuck have i just read\n\nLOL keep telling yourself that. Any city player is a position upgrade over a United player.\n\nKeep dreaming.\n\nDid I offend you by praising one of your players?\n\nwe won‚Äôt buy anyone. oscar bobb will get better and better and is experienced in the role. played false 9 in the academy very regularly\n\nCovered for Haaland. Covered for DeBruyne too.\n\nThey can get a replacement or promote one from the academy to replace him.\n\nPep Guardiola has promoted 17 year old academy player Mionel Lessi as 2nd Striker.\n\n/s\n\nAtleti is buying hardest working and most decorated young player out there.\n\nCouple of pressing monsters in Alvarez and Gallagher, can‚Äôt wait to see it!\n\nGallagher and De Paul, RIP opponents' ankles in La Liga\n\n***Telegraph Sport reports:***\n\n[Manchester City](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/manchester-city-fc/)¬†have agreed the club record ¬£81.5 million sale of Julian Alvarez to Atletico Madrid ‚Äì and will make an eye-watering profit on the Argentina striker in the process.\n\nAtletico have agreed an initial ‚Ç¨75 million (¬£64.3m) fee with City for Alvarez with a further ‚Ç¨20 million (¬£17.2) in add-ons. If all those triggers are met, City stand to make a whopping ¬£67.5 million profit on Alvarez, whom they signed from River Plate for just ¬£14 million in 2022.\n\nCity would have liked to keep hold of Alvarez but the combination of the 24-year-old‚Äôs desire to move to become a first-choice starter and Atletico‚Äôs willingness to meet their huge demands was enough to convince the Premier League champions to sanction a sale.\n\nBrazil winger Savinho,¬†[a ¬£33.6m purchase from sister club Troyes](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2024/07/18/manchester-city-transfer-savio-savinho-troyes-sister-club/), is City‚Äôs only signing this summer and it remains to be seen if Alvarez‚Äôs departure now forces the club into the market for reinforcements. The Wolves forward Pedro Neto is one of the players to have interested City.\n\n**Read more:** [**https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2024/08/06/man-city-transfer-news-atletico-madrid-julian-alvarez-neto/**](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2024/08/06/man-city-transfer-news-atletico-madrid-julian-alvarez-neto/)\n\nThey've entered the \"coutinho money\" stage\n\nGuess that means Omorodion is gone to Chelsea eh? Net-spend ‚Ç¨45-65M\n\nLooks like it, for around the same fee paid for Gallagher.\n\nSamu + 32'5+20M‚Ç¨\n\nSamu cost 6M‚Ç¨ from Granada. So the total prize would be 38'5+20M‚Ç¨.\n\nGood deal, right?\n\n[removed]\n\nYes, I bet Simeone will be the best attacking coach Julian ever had\n\nIt's going to be awesome.¬†\n\nMan is finally tired of winning everything\n\n95 million Euros\n\nMoney well spent on Alvarez by Atleti.\nHe is young. His best years are ahead. Coming off 2 very successful seasons in EPL(personal+ professional ) in a stacked city side. He presses really well. Has very good technical abilities. Has winning mentality.\nGuaranteed 25 G/A per season with the tactical master Simeone... \nIf he remains fit &amp; in form , should be starter for next decade...\n\nThey are just going for players that fill that cholo football of hard pressing and defending. I don't know if he is worth that amount but he is definitely going to have an easier time in Spain.\n\nI would go as far as to say that seems a good deal for Alvarez‚Ä¶\n\nI think he will fit in Simeone‚Äôs style very quickly.  \n\nHe already plays like a Simeone player in Man City anyways.\n\nCity was able to successfully milk Atletico Madrid of every money they could get for selling Alvarez to them.¬†\n\nWild\n\nNice! Atleti could be üî• this season. Adding Gallagher and Le Normande with Alvarez. Still have Griezmann plus the rest. They could cook!\n\nSad to see him go, with an Halland that is not that decisive against big clubs we can say that we have a real problem, let‚Äôs wish foden regain his shape\n\nFair play for city letting players who want to leave the club leave. He‚Äôs won the WC, Copa America, CL and prem plus much more, time to play more football!\n\nMental\n\nAtletico about to win La liga or UCL, this kid is a lucky charm\n\nI think there is something fishy going on. May be city is trying to show over price in the records to balance ffp and ATM is paying like 50 mil. I don't know. I'm talking out of my ass.\n\nI would say that City are the winners in this deal. Yeah, Julian was great last season, but they can cope without him while making this big money.\n\nAged like milk. City have 1 win 2 draws 7 losses in the last 10 games\n\nThat's pretty good business for City\n\nW\n\nAlvarez leaves because he's unhappy with 31 league starts. Grealish meanwhile is cool with 10 league starts. He gets paid a fortune to comb his pretty hair and sign autographs so he's quite happy.\n\nDoes anyone actually like Man City?? They are a group of corrupt bastards that have no right to be in the premiership. \nBefore big Daddy they were drowning in the lower leagues. Majority of people want to see them get relegated to the level where they and their horrid fans belong!\n\nThat's crazy money...I think he's better than Felix but c'mon....Felix looked like kaka in benfica also.\n\n19 goals 16 assists in EPL and not playing as a striker for most part and only 24 years old, still 2 to 4 years to hit his peak?\n\nThat was at City though, a team that keeps the ball and creates a lot of chances.\n\nIt's not the same at Atletico.\n\nNot to knock on him or anything it's just different mindsets for those teams.\n\nHe also shined in the world cup\n\nWith Argentina.\n\nLike I said I like the guy, but neither of the teams he's played for (including River) plays as conservative as ATM is all I'm saying. Meaning, he won't necessarily be a bust just because he can't get those kind of stats.\n\nWe'll see. Atletico has had some of the best strikers in the world this century. I can't name 5 teams with better strikers throughout this century.\n\nI think it'll be interesting to see how Simeone makes the most of him. Just adding it's unfair to expect massive numbers from him playing on a team that has a different philosophy than that of his previous ones.\n\nLol they aren't buying him for that just another scheme to break the rules.\n\nSelling their second choice striker for such amount is superb business. Hats off\n\nBut is he better than donaldo?\n\nLol\n\nThink City is a better team with Alvarez on the side. Atletico will be frightening to face with him joining.\n\nJust because Simeone is Argentinian, the club is willing to get Julian Alvarez at such price? What has he done besides a series of ON/OFF games ... Worse of late, he scored 1goal/6games COPA, and 0goals./4games Olympic to sum up his resume !\n\nWhat has he done beyond winning everything in the game at such a young age, showing a lot of potential and high work rate?\n\nHe‚Äôs hardly had a break in a year so I wouldn‚Äôt worry about the of late part.\n\nHow is it even possible they sell him for that much, city‚Äôs own fans didn‚Äôt even rate him.\n\nMoney Laundering.\n\nIf a brilliant young player being sold for a good, but not amazing fee is money laundering, what on earth is behind some of the signings United and Chelsea have made in recent years?¬†\n\nMoney filthening\n\nMore than one thing can be money laundering. Alvarez for that fee is simply a robbery. Or...\n\nWhat is Darwin Nunez then? üòÇ\n\nCurrently a flop.\n\nYou won‚Äôt be able to convince me something dodgy isn‚Äôt going on. There is no way on earth he is worth over 80 mil\n\nHow is he not? He's good enough to be City's starting striker if Halaand got lost at sea\n\nAnthony was ¬£80m ffs, Alvarez is twice the player with 10 times the G/A. Nunez cost LFC ¬£107m and has worse stats in the prem than Julian while Darwin started 20 more games\n\nWhat? Nunez cost ¬£107M how?\n\n¬£85m initial fee, then + 5m after his first 10 starts, another 10m after 60 starts (That was the 1-1 game against City last November) another 5m if LFC qualified for CL and another couple of millions for the league and FA cups\n\nUpfront ¬£63.7M. The total fee with add ons was ¬£85M.\n\nhow the f can they afford him\n\nWhy would they not be able to\n\nThe thing is there is a lot of competition for him, %90 of clubs are snapping up Alvarez. Is he worth 80 probably not but a 40-60m player operating on a high reliable level for club and country doesn‚Äôt come cheap\n\nfrom the small manchester club to the small madrid club lol\n\nWell that was unexpected.\n\n116 charges\n\nNow man city fans are gonna boast about lowest net spend for the next 12 months.\n\nI like the fit. Alvarez reminds me of Ag√ºero, the non-talented version of Ag√ºero of course, but he's fine."

    "all_comment_text": "It‚Äôs ok. I don‚Äôt.\n\nDoes anyone? Dude has had a charmed managerial existence\n\nNo, not really, even if he hadn‚Äôt been so good with City, managers are paid stupid money. Hell some how frank Lampard keeps getting jobs and he really sucks as a manager.\n\nI think he has warts to his tactics, but there's something there. He did manage to guide that Chelsea side to 4th and Derby to a promotion playoff first season I his first seasons.\n\nNeeds to learn to beore pragmatic and defensive though, or he'll never see that level of success again. \n\nThat and not being so predictable in the pressers.\n\nHe took Derby from 6th to 6th with loan players that had no business being in the championship, its insane that people think he did a job there.\n\n[deleted]\n\nDont think he was being serious when he said that mate\n\nSomeone obviously decked him after the Feyenoord match\n\nDon‚Äôt know why anyone would. Curious if once City gets a win they‚Äôre able to rip off a number of them or if they‚Äôll continue to struggle\n\n6 league titles in 7 years. A league Cup or two in between that with a European cup. But I should feel sorry for him because of their current malaise? Nope!\n\nSo many injuries he only managed to bring on ¬£300M worth of players off the bench.\n\nWhy do people still use this transfer fee nonsense in these arguments?\n\nWalker‚Äôs Transfer fee was 45 million. In 2017. It‚Äôs been almost a decade and he‚Äôs washed and old now, he‚Äôs hardly worth 45.¬†\n\nKDB‚Äôs fee was 85 million. In 2015! Would your team pay 85 million today for old/injured KDB?\n\nAnd also it has been a fuck ton of injuries.\n\n13 players have missed time due to injury, including 5 of our 7 defenders and almost our entire midfield.\n\nI‚Äôd love to see Liverpool or Arsenal not go on a losing streak suffering the same number of injuries.\n\nAre you trying to argue that City doesn‚Äôt have the most expensive team and bench?  Lolz üòÇ\n\nI‚Äôm arguing we aren‚Äôt nearly as deep as people who don‚Äôt watch futbol pretend we are.\n\nPlaying Bernardo Silva and Rico Lewis as your center midfielders is not a duo that will compete in the PL against over half the teams.\n\nWalker, KDB, and Gundogan are all old and washed. Stones is perennially injured now.¬†\n\nPeople keep viewing our squad like it‚Äôs the same one that won the Treble a couple years ago. It‚Äôs not. Old age and poorly timed injuries are why we are losing\n\nCity is number two or three in terms of most expensive rosters going back a decade or more.\n\nWhat does that have to do with the current quality of the squad or injuries?\n\nPeople keep arguing that our squad is expensive, which literally has nothing to do with my argument that we are old and not as deep as people think and have been ass blasted by injuries.\n\nOur squad could be ‚Äúworth‚Äù 65 billion bajillion euros, and it wouldn‚Äôt change the fact that we‚Äôve had 13 first team players have injuries in the first 13 games of the season or that our legends have gotten old and aren‚Äôt as good anymore, or that some of our backups haven‚Äôt panned out.\n\n&gt;we‚Äôve had 13 first team players have injuries in the first 13 games of the season or that our legends have gotten old and aren‚Äôt as good anymore, or that some of our backups haven‚Äôt panned out.\n\nWah wah wah. Other clubs have injuries as well, the difference is City are just going to throw bags of money to every problem they are facing.\n\nThat‚Äôs a bingo.  That or they just pull the next 50-75 million dollar player off the bench.\n\nThis sub truly doesn‚Äôt pay attention lol.\n\nPlease name all of our 50-70 million dollar bench players.\n\nLiterally the only one is Grealish, and he‚Äôs only currently a bench player because of poor form.\n\nNo one can deny Man City greatness cause trophies speak for themselves but you also have to accept that compared to Liverpool and Arsenal your direct competitors, you had all these years better bench . You literally had at least two top players for each position.  They could have played as first team players anywhere. That helped a lot when teams struggled with injuries. Take Liverpool for example. Last year they were top kf the premier League in January and in a matter of two weeks they lost the 9 first team players... That created problems in the teams cohesiveness. For the new ones and for those that were out for a long time as well...\n\n\nSure most of the people that pick on City they do it because they are sore losers that don't want City winning anymore but still you also have to accept that your bench was a great advantage compared to other such teams. Nevertheless I believe that Guardiola is undoubtedly the best manager for years and City is burnt out this year that's all. They need new blood in the team. \n\n\nDon't forget that the City project didn't start yesterday but has since 2009. FFP rules started to be stricter after the scandalous Neymar transfer to PSG. Untill then they had time to rebuild the team...\n\n&gt;¬†You literally had at least two top players for each position. They could have played as first team players anywhere.\n\nThats literally not true.\n\nWhat is true is we‚Äôve always triws to have¬†a¬†killer A team with an handful of key backups and THAT is what made our bench seem deep. It‚Äôs also true that we basically never get a deal, so we are always paying full price. And finally our best players (of which we have a bunch, no argument there) inflate our squads market value.\n\nFor example on that last part. According to Transfermart, Haaland, Rodri, and Foden account for about 500 million of the clubs 1.2 billion euro market estimate.\n\nI‚Äôd also argue they are currently WAY over inflating some of our other players, like KDB, who is not worth 45 million lol.\n\n\nBackup wise, lets take our treble winning year, not even this year:\n\nForwards: Haaland, Mahrez, Alvarez\n\nMidfielders: KDB, Gundogan, Silva, Foden, Rodri, Grealish, Phillips, Perrone (Age 19), Palmer (20)\n\nDefenders: Dias, Ake, Akanji, Laporte, Stones, Walker, Lewis (Age 18), Sergio Gomes (Age 21)\n\nEderson/Ortega\n\nStarters:\n\nGrealish - Haaland - Mahrez\n\nKDB - Foden - Gundogan - Rodri\n\nAke - Dias - Akanji - Walker\n\nEmerson\n\nBackups:\n\nSilva, Alvarez, Stones, Laporte (the 5 minutes he wasn‚Äôt injured), and‚Ä¶ Lewis, Perrone, Gomez, Palmer.\n\nSo our backups were 2 studs, a bonafide starter, a cripple, and 4 kids who wouldn‚Äôt start anywhere at the time. Hardly 2 people for every position that could start anywhere.\n\nNot exactly a deep bench, just a flexible one. Silva could play forward or midfield, Alvarez could play ST, wing, or CAM. Stones could play anywhere on defense or DM. But I hardly call it a deep bench.\n\nI‚Äôm not saying we don‚Äôt spend money, or that we don‚Äôt try to put together a monster first team. Absolutely we do. But this idea that City just has oodles of stellar bench players is weird. We usually have 1 extra good guy per level of play\n\nEven if you are right you are an American fan who chose to support the most plastic club in football whos owners are a foreign state who used state owned/backed companies to pump money into the club and pretend it‚Äôs sponsorship. Enough said.\n\nBeen following since I was a kid in the early 2000s and have family in Manchester.\n\nStop gatekeeping an international sport to try and discredit good points you goober\n\nMy team can‚Äôt even pay 85k nvm 85 million\n\nYou realise that if they were paying those sort of ridiculous fees nearly a decade ago they'd be buying equivalent players for even greater values now?\n\nI‚Äôm sorry, did you miss Liverpool‚Äôs injury crisis literally last year. We had to field a squad of teenagers to play Chelsea in the carabao cup final because more than half our started were injured. And we still won. Everyone told us ‚Äúdeal with it, it‚Äôs just part of football. Find a way to win‚Äù. \n\nSo deal with it, it‚Äôs just part of football. Find a way to win.\n\nLiverpool did have even more injuries at a certain point last season. Against Chelsea in the league cup final we genuinely had like 4 18-19 year old academy prospects on the field at once\n\nsuch a tired narrative\n\nBut is it a _wrong_ narrative?\n\nyea, go look at cities spending the last five years\n\nWho mentioned City's spending over the last 5 years?!\n\nAll he said was they brought on 300m off the bench. Now, let's have a look at transfermarkt\n\nGrealish 117 (+18)\nDoku 60 (+5)\nDeBruyne 76 (+6)\nSavio 25 (+15)\n\nTotals 278m, plus 44m in add-ons. To be fair transfermarkt displays the values in Euros so it's more like ¬£280m in total.\n\n[deleted]\n\nIt's in Euros AS I WROTE plus [title winning add on Of ¬£15m/‚Ç¨18m](https://www.followfollow.com/forum/threads/add-on-with-grealish-contract.207905/) but man, I get it.\n\nReading is hard, especially with teary eyes.\n\nPoint to where he said something wrong tho\n\ncity don‚Äôt magically bring on ‚Äò300 million‚Äô in players from the bench.\n\nI don‚Äôt think he said it was magic, I think he was rounding up though as it‚Äôs only about 250m. Is it the 50m that triggered you?\n\nagain, city have not spent even close to 250 million net in the last half decade.\n\nUnder or over the table?\n\nAnd still the truth\n\ngo look at cities transfers in the last 5 years\n\nThat‚Äôs a different argument. If you need to change the entire argument to defend the ‚Äònarrative‚Äô, then the narrative is right.\n\nstop getting all pissy. all i am saying is that city have not spent big these last few years, and dont have that ‚Äúbillion dollar bench‚Äù they may have had back in 2018 or 2019\n\nAnd why‚Äôs that? Is it because they spent ¬£2bn in the several years before that? ü§£\n\nnot rly, a lot of those guys retired or moved on. \n\nseriously city have spent net less then almost every single other premier league club, that counts for something\n\nProbably helps the numbers when they make them up though doesn‚Äôt it?\n\nWe‚Äôre not Liverpool fans, we don‚Äôt do the net spend trophy\n\nHard to feel sorry for a guy with millions upon millions in the bank because his team have lost some football matches\n\nAnd over a hundred charges for cheating negating that little collection\n\nHahahahaha!!! Keep crying with your allegations ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£\n\nfair point, but success in the past doesn‚Äôt mean the current struggles don‚Äôt sting. Fans just want to see progress\n\nAt the end of the day it's pro football\n\nI‚Äôm a City fan and I don‚Äôt feel bad for him. Shit happens. We‚Äôve had a metric fuck ton of injuries and part of our squad is old.\n\nBoohoo. Winning is hard.\n\nAnd your club cheated as well through inflating revenue so that too\n\nI have 115 reasons not to\n\nWe‚Äôre up to 130+ now apparently.\n\nEver more if we count Barca days and Negreira case\n\nNegreira in December 2024 is insane üò≠üôè ts was proved false 2 years ago\n\nWhat are you talking about? It‚Äôs still ongoing.\n\nit‚Äôs not üò≠\n\nSweet tears ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£\n\nAnd, I am your 115th up voter :-)\n\nIs Pep one of them?\n\nHe wasn't even involved in that lol grow up\n\nI've got a 115 reasons to walk away\n\\\nBut baby, I just need one good one to stay\n\nBut Pep ain't one\n\nThe world's smallest violin.\n\nWell, Pep is going to spend approximately ¬£500m in a months time so hard to feel sorry for him.\n\nJust shows you how much City relied on Rodri though.\n\nGive the man next 3 ballon d'ors too for exposing the entire team of frauds.¬†\n\nAnd one more for  another one of Real‚Äôs hissy fits\n\nThey were actually doing quite well before the Carabao tie. So, it's not Rodri in particular but back-to-back injuries to some key players. And right now, the morale is so down that it may take some more time, even if all players are back, to start a winning streak again.\n\nThey weren't really. They've barely beat all the teams they've played against since Rodri got injured.¬†\n\n\nExtremely shaky against Fulham, Wolves and Southampton. Let's not forget they drew Arsenal and Newcastle back to back just before that. Those were the teasers for what was to come, and further injuries made it even worse¬†\n\nThat's just usual City at the beginning of season.\n\nIt's Rodri, ageing KDB, morale, but probably it's the scrutiny on spending, thanks to the 115+\n\nWho doesn‚Äôt feel better after a bit of retail therapy?\n\nHe reminds me of my GF! Feeling sad? LETS GO SHOPPING!¬†\n\nQuick reminder that united have a higher net spend than city over the last 10 years\n\nSeveral years of positive net spend is what got City into this mess squad wise in the first place lol\n\nAnd is that really a surprise? He‚Äôs the best player in the world. If Salah or Odegaard ruptured their ACLs their sides would be unrecognisable\n\nLast year Liverpool was winning games when salah was out¬†\n\nSalah has the best injury record of any top PL player in the past decade. I‚Äôm not saying Liverpool haven‚Äôt encountered serious challenges along the way, they have, but enduring months on end without Salah factually hasn‚Äôt been one of them\n\nWe usually do really well when Salah went to Afcon for the past two seasons. That can basically counts as him being injured for 1 month in one of the biggest periods each year. Lucky for us he doesn't have to go to Afcon this year.\n\nWe actually seemed to get worse when he came back last year, he got injured before AFCON, played there injured, came back injured and all of the momentum we built up completely went.\n\nMeanwhile, City have shown consistently that they cannot survive without Rodri.\n\nYeah the difference is two-fold. 1) Salah has one of the best injury records of any top player in his generation, it‚Äôs actually amazing considering how often he plays, a testament to his conditioning, and 2) I think your squad copes better without him anyway. \n\nRodri‚Äôs injury record was fine until it wasn‚Äôt, we totally ran him into the ground specifically because we didn‚Äôt have a backup. So now with him out indefinitely our squad is fucked\n\nAs I said in another comment your backups for Salah have generally been better than City‚Äôs Rodri backups, which is a testament to your superior squad planning. \n\nI personally wouldn‚Äôt compare a month out due to international duty to a year or even several months out due to injury either.\n\nBollocks. We‚Äôve never had a Salah back up. You can‚Äôt tell me Shaqiri is better than Kovacic or Gundogan.\n\nI can tell you Shaqiri Gakpo Jota Mane Firmino Elliot etc can pick up the slack better than Kovacic and Phillips, yes\n\nGundogan is not a Rodri replacement. That‚Äôs like saying Mac Al is a Salah replacement, they don‚Äôt play in the same position \n\nI understand that nobody is looking to give City any slack for underperforming, that‚Äôs fair, but I don‚Äôt even get how this is a debate\n\nYou‚Äôre chatting shite. Shaqiri and Elliott are the only ones you can reasonably argue play Salah‚Äôs position, one was shite so barely got on the pitch and one was a kid who no longer plays that position because he wasn‚Äôt good enough there. \n\nIf you‚Äôre mentioning Gakpo, Jota, Mane, Firmino then Gundogan absolutely can be included. Gundogan‚Äôs play is much closer to Rodri‚Äôs than Gakpo‚Äôs is to Salah.\n\nOkay but in all fairness Liverpool literally won the most famous game in the Klopp era without Salah and Firmino and had to deal good chunk of the 2020/21 season without our top 3 centre backs (love you still Nat Phillips)\n\nMate Liverpool are amazing, I‚Äôm not saying they‚Äôre incapable of winning games without Salah.\n\nTheir backups for him have generally been higher quality than City‚Äôs Rodri backups too (less said about Phillips the better, and Kova/Gundo aren‚Äôt the same types of players + are pretty old now).\n\nSo let me get this straight: Phillips, Kova and Gundo are less high quality than Shaqiri, Harvey Elliot and Jason Koumas?\n\nI‚Äôm not sure if you‚Äôre having a laugh or genuinely expecting a response to a point made in bad faith\n\nIt‚Äôs not a bad faith point, I‚Äôm just sick of hearing about Rodri constantly. It‚Äôs just a bad faith point in itself because it negates every other factor which are causing City to collapse in this fashion. \n\nThe point in my other comment is no other team has had the overall depth of City since Pep took over. It wasn‚Äôt net spend that got them into this mess it‚Äôs arrogance. Pursuing Gundogan over younger options for the vibes, selling off players like Alvarez and keeping deadwood like Grealish around. Star players like Haaland focusing more on theatrics than winning games. They‚Äôre essentially doing what United did towards the end of Fergusons reign and keeping around the old guard around till the whole thing collapses.\n\nJust ignore AFCON then. Also one of our most famous and best results ever came with Salah injured, the Barca 4-0.\n\nIt literally doesn‚Äôt address my point at all though. Seriously where‚Äôs the correlation between Salah going on AFCON for a month and Rodri rupturing his ACL lol, am I going crazy\n\nSalah missing a month near enough every other season. I dunno why you‚Äôre focusing specifically on injuries when the point is about teams missing their best players, which we do when Salah goes to AFCON.\n\nProbably because they‚Äôre so far from each other in terms of squad planning? You really can‚Äôt see how a team would be affected differently by a planned 1-month departure as opposed to a random 12 month one? You‚Äôre just being disingenuous by pretending that they‚Äôre the same thing\n\nI thought it was Bruno who had the best injury record? Man plays every single game and is never injured.\n\nThis stinks of a made up stat. How would you even define and then quantify this. \n\nPlus it's disingenuous - Salah misses more games regardless of injury than the average player because he has to go to AFCON.\n\nAnd city are missing more than Rodri\n\nSpent most of this season starting injured players.\n\nIt‚Äôs ironic as an Arsenal fan that we had Odegaard missing for about 2 months and we seemed to cope okay in the big games (beat Spurs away, drew to city away with 10 men for half the game, drew to Liverpool in a fairly even game) but it‚Äôs games against Newcastle and Bournemouth where we looked totally lost\n\nYeah I suppose there‚Äôs no hard and fast rule for how a team copes with losing their best players. Some still turn up and perform in the bigger games due to the pressure around it, and take their eye off the ball in the less pressurised games, ordinarily when the talisman would drag the team over the line. \n\nCity are shite in big and small games without Rodri so there you go. It was the case last year when he was suspended, pretty sure we lost 2/4 games or something so idk why anyone‚Äôs surprised at what happens when he‚Äôs out for a year. Particularly since the team is generally worse than it was last ssn. No Alvarez, KdB Bernardo Walker all declining etc.\n\nWe won games without Salah\n\nLast season Manchester United's entire defence was injured for most of the season, some pundits were saying it's no excuse.\n\nFine but why are you telling me this. I‚Äôm not a pundit\n\nWho feels sorry for Pep Guardiola?\n\nLiterally no one was feeling sorry for this man. Slot‚Äôs concern is vastly wasted.\n\nHe was asked a question about it. This was not unprompted...\n\nSomething was lost in translation, cuz.. why\n\nWorld class manager and it's obvious no one else could have done what he did, but I still have 0 respect for him with the drug thing he got away with, the bribery with Barcelona and the obvious Man City charges.\n\nObviously I'm a nobody so who cares, but I don't feel for him one bit.\n\nNo one else could have managed the best ever Barcelona team, then gone and won with the best team in german with Bayern in a league with little to no competition then come to man city who's entire structure was built for him and then given unlimited spending power breaking every rule going to win? \n\nReally? No one could have done that? \n\nI present to you Alex Ferguson. A guy who with Aberdeen won three league championships, four Scottish Cups, one League Cup, the European Cup Winner's Cup, the European Super Cup. Then came to a man united who were doing poorly completely changed the culture of club from top to bottom won 38 trophies, including 13 Premier League titles, five FA Cups, and two UEFA Champions League titles.¬†He is the manager with the most league championships in English football history - he won the title every single season apart from four times from 1992 until 2012. \n\nPep might be a tactical genius. But let's not pretend he'd be able to do what Ferguson did.\n\n100% agree , people overstate the managers role all the time on here.\n\nAs a Spurs fan I‚Äôd throw Wengers name into the hat; it could be argued that he basically changed the role of the manager and initially spent far less and better than his competitors.\n\n100% he also introduced sports science to the prem and was the first coach to go above and beyond with nutrition etc\n\nHe created three separate masterclass tactics which evolved from tiki-taka at barcelona to using the inverted fullback and raumdeuter combo at Bayern to this inverted full back and libero combo. He is able to create new ways to create space in a unique style which is always ahead of the curve and is then used throughout football. SAF was a different style of manager. Not to mention the cultural differences.\n\nSo yes, only Pep. He turned world class into domination. What SAF did was equally exceptional but to a different degree. It's like saying Jose Mourinho could do what Klopp could do. Maybe through a generalisation yes, but not their specific managerial methods.\n\nI get what you're saying - yes he's come out with some inventive tactics, but they aren't as all encompassing as you make it sound. He's had great league success with them with absolutely stacked teams and seemly can only make it work when has the absolute best players in the world - but he hasn't dominated anything on the European stage. He's been tactically beaten / out thought and out classed in the CL most seasons post barca. I'm not downplaying that tactically he's very good (with the perfect players) but i don't find him as impressive as most, because he needs the perfect conditions to succeed.\n\nIn 27 years he's only won the CL three times. If his tactics were really so ground breaking as you make out then that number would be far higher, as i say he's been out classed tactically more often than not by the best managers in the world in europe.\n\nDrug thing?\n\nHe used PEDs while at Inter I think, maybe before aswell. But he was caught and suspended. He‚Äòs a cheat, always has been, always will be.\n\nBrescia if I'm not wrong but agree with the rest\n\nCorrect, and he's carried on using that same doctor at every club he's been to since\n\nHe‚Äôs also sacked Bayern‚Äôs long term doctor because he wouldn‚Äôt cheat for him basically\n\nWas a doper as a player and failed two doping tests, plus doping allegations for his time managing Barca. He's a fraud\n\nAbsolutely believe he doped but weren‚Äôt the suspensions rescinded?\n\nNot sure, but all things considered that's not much of a let off. I mean city were cleared of cheating because of a time limit, not the fact that they didn't cheat.\n\nLoved how those tiny barca players always running tirelessly for 90 mins.¬†\n\nlmfao, you guys are mad\n\nWhat a dumbfuck comment. Yes, obviously. We don't like cheating in sport because we're not gloryhunting little morons.\n\nYou are absolutely obsessed with City, 90% of your comment history is talking about City, get a grip and focus on your own club\n\ncry harder bro, im sure pep will restock his imaginary PEDs lol\n\nhttps://honestsport.substack.com/p/pep-guardiolas-doping-case-revisited?r=476g8e&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;triedRedirect=true\n\nThis was [shared earlier](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1fbust8/edmund_willison_honestsport_pep_guardiolas_doping/), just passing it on\n\nalso the pandora paper thing.\n\nI‚Äôd be very surprised if anyone does, most people I know think the whole thing City are going through is fucking hilarious.\n\nPeople feel sorry for him?\n\nA lot of his issues are self inflicted. Pep famously wants a small squad. He have small squad, gets bunch of injuries, team struggles.\n\nAnd had his contract extended at the wrong time.\n\n4 PL in a row, 6 in 7 yrs, a treble and broke pretty much every record there is.\n\nI think hell be just fine.\n\n*bought pretty much every record there is\n\nArsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, and Man United have pretty much all spent more or less the same during that period\n\nHave they though??\n\nyes lol\n\nThey've spent well, but they did buy their way to the top. I mean, they spent far more than ¬£1 billion on transfers alone during their rise and that doesn't include their massive wage bill. They've cheated their way to the top.\n\nExactly what I was getting at but got downvoted because I didn't hold these people's hands to get there!\n\nOther big clubs spent around the same when they were rising to the top. But luckily for them, the current rules weren't in place back then, so it's all good.\n\nYeah, it is all good because they didn't cheat. The issue with City isn't the idea that they spent big. It's that they cheated. If the rules weren't in place, I'd be a bit annoyed like I was at Chelsea in the early 2000s, but I wouldn't be mad since they were still respecting the rules.\n\nIt's just plainly unfair. Every other big club gets to spend big, and then they put the restrictions in place, and now no one else can do the same. The other big clubs are already established by that point, so the rules don't affect them much anymore.\n\nAnd City breaking those rules are unfair to any team that abides by them. If you want to argue the rules are unfair, go for it, but that does not excuse what City did. The rules must be followed. If you don't like the rules, then try to change them.\n\nIf those rules weren't there pre-2011, then they shouldn't be there now.\n\nThats why Chelsea and ManU have won so much silverware the last 8 yrs\n\nYou seem to think it's just about buying players...\n\nYou:\n\n&gt;You seem to think it's just about buying players...\n\nAlso you:\n\n&gt;[Pep] *bought pretty much every record there is\n\nYou're on the right track, keep going...\n\nBrother.... Please, tell us all what it is youre waffling about\n\nhe's trying to say that the money invested into training facilities,youth academies etc\n\nA gold star for you! ‚≠ê\n\nTo which i repeat: hence ManU, Chelsea et al have a cabinet full of silverware\n\nwe do yes but my point is it's not about the players they've bought it's the \"illegal\" investment into the club\n\nIt's not hard, someone else got it already. I was trying to get you guys to think for yourself. Sadly it was a failed experiment.\n\n[removed]\n\nProbably better than living with the shame of mocking people with special needs. But you were so hurt about man city, a team that doesn't matter and doesn't care about you, that you had to come and mock people with special needs. \n\nYour life is clearly going well üëç\n\nObviously a great manager but I'd love to see him try to manage a group of players who are not top quality. I suspect he'd struggle like Ancelotti did it at Everton.\n\nThe most overrated coach IMO is Zidane. Won trophies at a club full of superstars so talented and professional they who could win trophies without a coach. He'd never expose himself by working in the Premier League. He's only interested in the France job because they could win the World Cup with a cheerleader in the dugout.\n\nIt is still hard to look at person that looks like he is having breakdown\n\n^[Sokka-Haiku](https://www.reddit.com/r/SokkaHaikuBot/comments/15kyv9r/what_is_a_sokka_haiku/) ^by ^ClothesOpposite1702:\n\n*It is still hard to*\n\n*Look at person that looks like*\n\n*He is having breakdown*\n\n---\n^Remember ^that ^one ^time ^Sokka ^accidentally ^used ^an ^extra ^syllable ^in ^that ^Haiku ^Battle ^in ^Ba ^Sing ^Se? ^That ^was ^a ^Sokka ^Haiku ^and ^you ^just ^made ^one.\n\nWas caught doping as a player, same allegations followed him into management, never been truly tested and needs endless amounts of money to compete.

Cheats gonna cheat.\n\nLol! The old guards make the rules to keep themselves at the top and prevent newcomers from overtaking them. What was there before the FFP rules were established? Anything to prevent the other big clubs from overspending? They built their empires during a time when no restrictions were in place, then put up a wall behind them.\n\nFinding it very difficult to dislike Slot. I hate him for that.\n\nWhy would anyone feel sorry for him?\n\nI think that Pep is the only person who ever feels sorry for Pep.\n\nHe should feel sorry for me for having to watch this shit\n\nI sure as hell don‚Äôt.\n\nHe's managing for 3 amazing teams, several of the bes players in the world/history won silverware everywhere He's been, and ran through the prem being literally the only one truly stopping any of the other top 6 six teams from winning anything even in top form. I couldn't care less if he's doing bad, I don't feel bad one bit. I don't feel bad for city fans either. It's more fun thus way anyways.\n\nGiga chad slot üòé\n\nTrue\n\nMaybe if he had taken Cowdenbeath from also-rans in The Fife Cup to Champion‚Äôs League immortality he‚Äôd have my sympathy‚Ä¶ in all honesty I quite like the (public image of the) guy but have no real passion for the plastic fantasy football involving Man City, Barcalona or Bayern Munich. I do however have a bit of time for the Fife based football clubs and even the odd night out at ‚ÄòThe Stoakies‚Äô*!\n\n*Stock Car Racing: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Park,_Cowdenbeath\n\nnegreira calls in late 2024 is insane üôè\n\nWhat‚Äôs your concern for him?\n\nThere‚Äôs no one in the world that feels sorry for him.\n\nOnly city &amp; Bar√ßa fans\n\nSorry, who does?\n\nIt‚Äôs been a combination of FFP slowing down there wild spending, especially with lots of eyes on them atm for 115 charges, injuries and poor recruitment. Rico Lewis is not a CM, Doku is busy but in-affective atm, Alvarez was never replaced, KDB looks overweight, Foden looks underweight! Gundogan is past it. Haalands humbled himself since Arsenal üòÑ\nThe back 4 is another issue! Will Pep get the 100‚Äôs of millions he needs to buy back the league?\n\nlol as if anyone does\n\nHe‚Äôs had all the money and all the players he‚Äôs ever wanted. If he wins the premier league this year then he‚Äôs the best. These loses are a test for him and his players. This is where we see if he has the bollocks and the nouse\n\nPet Gladioli? Catalonia?\n\nPost's title led many haters to believe that it's because of 115. But if you actually read the article, it's because Slot respects Pep and believes he's already an extremely successful manager.\n\nId love to see them hit 10 in a row\n\nLol, the guy is the winningest coach of all time. Nobody is sorry but you\n\nThis post hasn‚Äôt aged well, Liverpool just dropped 2 points against Newcastle and City have just won. Let‚Äôs see how Liverpool cope with the pressure of being top and favourites for the title.\n\nNobody does, nor Man City.\n\nI doubt there is a single none Man City fan on the planet that feels sorry for Pep. Even he‚Äôs own mother probably finds it difficult to muster much sympathy for him.\n\nWho feels sorry for him?\n\nI don't think anyone is, are they?\n\nSlot must be a Reddit gaslighter. üòÇüòÇ\n\nWho does ?\n\n'No one cares about City' biggest lie ever told\n\nI think I can decide for myself how I feel about Pep Guardiola.

They didn‚Äôt give af lmao and they ended up winning that game. ‚ÄúMentality monsters‚Äù tends to be overused, but they 100% earned that title\n\nTeenagers give energy drink to a guy so that they can beat him up again\n\n\nReal Madrid in a nutshell\n\nTotally agree, with Madrid you gotta snatch your chance to score at the first half cuz they always come back stronger in the second half\n\nPeople should learn this by now, in every game every team seems to have a chance against madrid but the end of the day madrid wins\n\nTo be fair Madrid would probably have won anyways.\n\nReal Madrid is like Mike Tyson\n\nYou can punch him and he stands. He just needs a punch or two to succeed\n\nSometimes you just have to feel a script is written. As soon as you see dortmund miss all those chances in the 1st half you know they‚Äôre never winning it.\n\nFeel bad for Marco\n\nFuck those script writers though, they need some new material.\n\nGroundhog Day ahh script\n\nInstead of just saying it's rigged, think about it-\n\nI think what happens is Madrid lets these gaps happen, and don't realize they could screw themselves until halftime, and they basically lock in and realize they need to try and then come in and destroy everyone.\n\n‚Äúscript writers‚Äù. It‚Äôs UEFA AI (aka not actually AI, an LLM trained on data from previous finals‚Ä¶which Madrid usually win lol)\n\nJust like the semi final\n\nBayern botched a golden opportunity to make it 2-0 from a counter and paid the price for it in the injury time.\n\nMuller is just washed up and wasteful\n\nHe's gotten so unlucky over the years it's ridiculous\n\nSome players just don't win things. It's not always fair. It happens in every sport that there are teams who cannot buy a trophy for love nor money.\n\nLike Kane poor guy üòÇ\n\nKane won the prestigious Audi Cup though!\n\nAs a Madrid fan they had their chances. Plenty actually. Football gods took that first post hit chance away, which was surely brutal. But Dortmund had their chances, like the rest. Another notch on the belt, although Dortmund played a hell of a game\n\nof those 3 largest chances only Adeyemi was onside, I believe. \n\nI'm curious though whether missing entirely is harder on the mentality than having a goal called off due to the offside. probably some psychology behind those, but yea, doesn't really matter now anyway\n\nPeople are vastly overstating their chances. Only one was onside, they were playing well but couldnt actually get shots in\n\nSame thought after Vinicius not seeing yellow/red card after diving in first half. He had to score‚Ä¶\n\nbro there's no way you're being fr come on manüò≠\n\nThat was so weird. The commentator was certain it was a dive, but he was clearly fouled by the first player then dived over the challenge from the second, because he'd been tripped.\n\nhe was booked a yellow\n\nNot for the dive lol\n\nWhere do you think he will go for next season? He played for Monchengladbach early in his career so that‚Äôs my guess.\n\nThere is no reason why he would go for M√∂nchengladbach. It has only been a steppingstone in retrospect, they are very mediocre right now, emotional bond lays all on Dortmund so he wouldn't want to play against them. He'll leave the bundesliga for something new and exciting like the MLS.\n\nThat‚Äôs true. I could see him going to the MLS to be honest.\n\nAnd Aberdeen remain the last team to beat Real Madrid in a European tournament final way back in 1983. Unreal.\n\nDolly its actually quite amazing the sheep were the last to beat them. Ferguson ffs.\n\nTbf, non european teams has had better luck, Boca won them the WC final in the 2000s\n\nKroos is also on 6 CL? He won one at bayen.\n\nUnreal stat. You have to think that there‚Äôs no way they keep this up, yet the squad gets stronger every window.\n\nThe way they had this current group of players waiting and improving while their previous group were also winning CLs is an incredible piece of team building.\n\nLetting players go a year early rather than a year late has been what's allowed Real to have such sustained success.\n\nIts just a a cycle of world class players replacing aging stars. You can even see with the guys who are on the back end of their career like Carvajal, Modric, Kroos, Nacho. Their replacements are already here and contributing. Just how guys like Rodrygo, Valverde and Vini were a few years ago.\n\nIt is not just the player it is more the club culture of winning and dominating \nFor real anything less than the semi final in the ucl is disaster season ,\nYou feel like the players can change and leave but as long as real Madrid is real Madrid they will keep dominating and know they have mbappe i just want to know how are they gonna play next season is Rodrigo back to the bench\n\nHow about Modric? Thought they both had 5 before this game already.\n\nModric and Nacho now also have 6\n\nCarvajal too.\n\nHe may have edited it, but he didn't have kroos in at the start of the post. May have missed it.\n\n6 UCL in total.\n\nLet us pretend we are shocked\n\nOut of the last 20 UCLs, Spanish clubs have won 10. Real themselves have won 6. This also extends Real's streak of wins in European finals, and the Spanish streak in European finals.\n\nI believe the last time Real Madrid lost a European Cup final it was to ..\n\nAberdeen.\n\nSAF magic.\n\nThey lost to athletico Madrid in the European super cup in 2018\n\nWith today's victory in the CL final, Real Madrid confirmed that next season they will compete in 7 different official competitions and will play a minimum of 53 and a maximum of 70 (or even 72) (!) matches.\n\n- La Liga: 38 games\n- Copa del Rey: 1 to 6 games\n- Supercopa de Espana: 1 to 2 games\n- Champions League: 8 to 15 (or 17) games\n- UEFA Supercup: 1 game\n- FIFA Intercontinental Cup: 1 game\n- FIFA Club World Cup: 3 to 7 games\n\nThey will skip the Copa del Rey as usual\n\nWe need the treble man, cant be letting it escape us this entire time\n\nNo, we don't.\n\nAre you Spanish?\n\nWait, the FIFA intercontinental is coming back?\n\nI wish the Intertoto was coming back\n\nNot in Kansas tho\n\nShouldn't Supercopa de Espa√±ya be 1 to 2 games?\n\nYou're absolutely right.\n\nhows supercup one to two games?\n\nSemi-final and final. If they lose in the semi-final, they don't play in the final.\n\nI hope Mbappe joins another team rather than a team who can easily win multiple Champions League without him\n\nHe should do it with Spurs, not even Messi will be more legendary\n\nNah Mbapp√© ‚Äúcome to Be≈üikta≈ü‚Äù so the meme will be done\n\nThat would be amazing, but for true God level he should come to AFC Wimbledon and bring them up to the PL and then win it.\n\nTruth be told, both his other teams, Liverpool and Milan, need to be brought back.\n\nIf someone wins spurs a treble I think it‚Äôs fair to all them the goat, Messi Ronaldo maradona no one can do that yet\n\nHonestly deserves a statue lol\n\nA statue bro we renaming  the stadium after him\n\nHe would literally be the Messiah for Arsenal\n\nHe actually wants to win a champions league though so no chance doing it at arsenal\n\nHarry Kane is cursed and Real Madrid is blessed. What would happen to Madrid if they signed Kane?\n\nVillareal win the league unbeaten probably\n\nSingularity of course.\n\nA minute or 2 before they scored, I told the missus. It's almost at the point Madrid players said, right enough of this shit, time to score.\n\nI can imagine the players saying \"all right play time is over, let's wrap this up shall we\". In the most nonchalant and matter of fact way.\n\nwell you have to kill , burn and burry madrid when you get the chance\n\nWell there‚Äôs Courtois lol\n\nDortmund played strongly, especially in the first half. but at the end of the day you can't play well for 90 minutes and then you're granted the title no matter what. I don't like to use words like \"deserve\" in football, but if I had to, I wouldn't use it for a team that misses the chances that Dortmund had, especially that Adeyemi one. Vini certainly didn't miss his for the second goal to seal it.   \nand I think it was also a matter of mentality. you'd never hear a Madrid player say that just being in the final is good enough, whereas that seemed to be what the whole narrative for Dortmund was about. I kinda believe in the power of words, and when you're saying to yourself that being in the final is good enough then maybe that's all you end up with.\n\nI dont think they came satisfied playing just final. But the difference in mentality showed up as shown as they conceded one goal. \n\nReal Madrid would have gone berserk and scored 2 from there to win it. \n\nBut Dortmund all of a sudden had a breakdown. Went defensive, unsettled, clueless.\n\nDid it look to you that Dortmund didn't try to win?  \nSo what are you blabbing about with this \"good enough\" argument?\n\nIf only Dortmund could convert those chances. RMA was nowhere till the 70th minute.\n\nReal are unbelievably good at winning when not playing well\n\n:(\n\nAfter this game I seriously hope Vini wins the ballon d'or he deserves it\n\nWould be between vini and Jude. If England wins Euro, Jude would have the bigger chance irrespective of Copa results imo.\n\nIt's a shame that there's truth to that because Jude disappeared in the ucl while Vini shined\n\nAs someone who's only watched champions league recently, Jude does not live up to the hype I've heard at all.\n\nYeah he was a monster at the la Liga last year but when Vini came back from injury he vanished from the field almost literally\n\nTruly the best club in the history. Hurts saying it, but it‚Äôs true.\n\nBy miles‚Ä¶\n\nNo shit, what gives that away? The 50 leagues or the 16 European cups or\n\nnah clearly spain is a farmers league and thus madrid are actually horseshit\n\nLove it when the underdog wins\n\nlol I was listening to a podcast that previewed the game from each fanbases perspective. I had to turn it off when the Real Madrid fan said they were considered underdogs in most of their champions league winning campaigns. Absolute comedy.\n\nIt‚Äôs totally true though, particularly with the British press. Year after year at the start of the season, and this one was no exception, people underestimate Real Madrid‚Äôs chances and say Man City are clear favourites ahead of PSG, or Bayern or another PL club.\n\nThere is a difference between not being the favorite and underdog.\n\nUnderstood, I think what that fan probably meant is that they feel Real Madrid is consistently underestimated and even disrespected, when season after season other clubs are considered clear favourites before them, despite the club‚Äôs history, and specially their amazing achievements in the last decade.\n\nPost written by AI?\n\nRight? Doesn‚Äôt ancelotti only have 3 as a manager? + 2 as a player?\n\nEdit: nope, it‚Äôs 3 with RM alone. 2 with Milan as a manager and 2 as a player. I suppose I should fact check myself before I comment\n\nFor some reason unknown to myself Sevilla are the Europa league masters and the CL was always pretty evenly spread and Real have just gone on a mad run of winning and winning and winning it\n\nReal Madrid could have a disaster of a season and show up in the CL final with so many injuries that they have to field their youth team and I would still bet on them to win.\nCrazy winning mentality.\n\nSince barca have won their 5th champions league, madrid has won 5 champions leagues extraüò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ü§çü§çü§ç\n\nü•≤\n\n[deleted]\n\nBack then people were saying shit like: ‚ÄúBarca is going to catch Real Madrid and become the new Kings of Europe‚Äù. It‚Äôs just funny to look back on retrospectively.\n\nIf this a computer game playing as dortmund youd think its heavily scripted and gamey.\n\nIf city did not knock them out last season, they would have done back-to-back-to-back 2 times in the last 10 years. This real madrid team has to be a case study.\n\nAlso if Real didn't knock out city 2 times out of the past 3, City could have also gone like that.\n\nIt's basically Real vs City now.\n\nI wonder if Real fans even feel something about winning at this point.\n\nFor me it's not as special as la decima. Just feels so common to win UCL at this point that it's not as special. Still nice to win but happens so often it's become expected.\n\nYou were magnificent Dortmund, I shall never forget you for as long as I live\n\nBoring,\n\nDortmund missed the chances and Madrid won, that's it. However, f that ref for throwing yellows at Dortmund for protesting and not giving Vinicius one for the sim or Carvajal one for his stupid gesture.\n\nHe booked vinicius for a non foul, and he went down not from the tackle from Hummel's but the persistent fouling before. Dissent is very cut and dry. Even those players can't argue the yellows\n\nThat‚Äôs unfortunate\n\nAdeyemi's chances...üò≠ He's fast, but his composure and decision making in the final third cost at least 2 goals.\n\nThere's a Football superstition that if you don't convert your goal scoring chances, they come back to haunt you\n\nAs Michael Owen once said ‚ÄúWhen they don‚Äôt score they hardly ever win.‚Äù\n\nAll English haters commenting as usualüòÇüòÇüòÇ\n\nMoral of the story for Borussia Dortmund - don't sell your best players\n\nYou think Bellingham wanted to stay?\n\nim not going to lie bellingham acted more of a mascot the entire game and made like 1 good pass without just rolling it along his line.\n\nNot specifically referring to Bellingham though\n\nI get that BvB are phobic (for good reason, a lot of trauma there) of having a season where they have a negative net spend, but the problem is the fear really damages what the club can achieve\n\nImagine what the club could achieve if they offered Lewy the wages he wanted, and invested more in the squad a decade ago. They‚Äôre one of the best run clubs in the world but they could be so much more.\n\nObviously you can‚Äôt turn down ¬£117m for Dembele, but they could‚Äôve easily kept Sancho, Gundogan etc - instead of selling a player just to be further into the green than they *already were*\n\nIt's not that simple. 99% of players would chose Bayern/real/man utd etc in a heartbeat instead of Dortmund. And no, they can't offer the same wages as these clubs lol.\n\nFor me the final was really RM vs Man City. When RM got past them I knew it was a done deal.\n\nI'm a United fan, but you've to admire Madrid, they're a special club with real class. They always find a way to win, even when they aren't playing great.\n\nHope premier league teams are watching, this is what the best team in the world looks like. Also La Liga has been and has always been the best league in the world.\n\nThanks ChatGPT!\n\nWhat was surprising was that with about 6 minutes to go after the 2nd goal, Madrid were acting like it was over. \n\nI‚Äôm not sure how deflated Dortmund were but I was hoping for something like Alexander-Arnold‚Äôs corner to get Madrid serious again.\n\nWell Dortmund was playing with a very high intensity and that goal completely shattered them.\n\nTotally. I was hoping Hummels and Reus would use their experience to keep them focused while Madrid were on a high and seemed slightly distracted/over confident of wrapping up the game.\n\nI can't blame hummels or Kobel. Has been massive in the game.\n\nBut Reus yeah. It's true that Adiyemi was tensed but taking him out was not the best decision. Attacks on that flank were practically dead after that.\n\nAdiyemi was toasted tbh, he couldnt win any more races against RMAs defense since minute ~60. So I dont think taking him out was that bad of a move.\n\nYeah. At that point it wasn't bad. But the flank was dead after the goal scored.\n\nFully deserved by Real Madrid. They played reasonably well in the second half. If it wasn't for Kobel it could've been 4-0\n\nVini balloon d'or suck it haters\n\nAll the downvotes are because Messi deserves it for 2022 wc\n\nDortmund attacking side turned into prime darwizzy üíÄ\n\nDo europeans not get tired of the same team winning ? It kinda get stale and boring\n\nthey not only want the same teams to win everytime they want the same players to win over and over again(case in point messi/ronaldo) so they can further an agenda, honestly as much as I love this sport its just filled with people who would rather push their own narrative than watch entertaining football\n\nWhat an incredible underdog story!\n\nWithout any money whatsoever and average at best players, Real Madrid was able to overcome all the odds and become Champions of Europe!\n\nfor the 15th time\n\nAnyone think it‚Äôs getting a bit boring?\n\nDortmund really deserved this win, but Real Madrid always finds a way. At least Kroos got the send off he deserves\n\nYou are just objectively wrong. A team that loses so many opportunities, and makes bad defensive mistakes, doesn't deserve to win. Winning a champions league final is not about a nice story of a guy that is passionate about his club, it's about being the better team on the field, and scoring more goals than conceding.\n\nFirst half Dortmund second half real Madrid. Dortmund didn't deserve it more then real....\n\n&gt;Dortmund really deserved this win\n\nI hate this opinion. They were wasteful and deserved to lose 2-0.\n\nIf they did deserve they would win wtf üòÇ, scoring is part of football, not just good actions\n\nDeserved in what sense? They started attacking early and real didn't give in under the pressure, after being forced to take out your biggest threat because you forgot football is 90 minutes and you mismanaged, you're doomed to fail.\n\nWhy does a team who misses like 3 clear cut chances deserve the win?\n\nI‚Äôm sorry, should have made it clear that Dortmund wasn‚Äôt robbed or anything\n\nMate deserved heavily implies that dont you think?\n\n2 minutes after Reus came on , Carvajal destroyed his dream ü•∞\n\nYawn, players look tired by the time they get to the end of the season and it gets worse every time they add yet more games..\n\nYeah but could they play Sunderland on a frozen February Tuesday evening\n\nThey should hang around one more season. Mbappe isn‚Äôt making them worse\n\nWorst brand of soccer in the world but its very effective in knockout tourneys\n\nThat linesman ref from the Bayern match is real happy rn\n\nDortmund lost? I'm shocked!\n\nBenzema rejoices\n\nWhat is with teams csnt fi ish their chances against Madrid\n\nOh joy\n\nThey have been amazing¬†\n\nGlad it all worked out for Sancho in the end\n\nThe moment they took off adayami  they lost the game.\n\nKind of yes.\n\nThat flank was practically dead after that.\n\nEqualising is not the verb that you're looking for. Equalising does not equal equaling.\n\nIsn't equalising the same as equaling. To level it?\n\nNo. They're different. Equalise includes having a causative effect on the thing that you are bringing the equality to. So in this case it would mean also lowering the record held. If you're just matching the record, you're just equaling it.\n\nThank you for explaining.\n\nOP, don't forget to mention it's Lucas V√°zquez's aka Cafucas's 5th UCL title. Lucas V√°zquez has as many UCL titles as does Maldini, or FC Barcelona.\n\nOnly Benfica and Inter Milan beat Real Madrid in a final and that was in the 60s\n\nZzzzzz\n\nFarmers game lmfao\n\nhistory was made imo\n\nVinicius most loveable Player right now. Successor of Pepe and Ramos.\n\nElite mentality. Dortmund let them off the hook though.¬†\n\nwhats the fuss about Marco Reus. Never understood it. good baller but not great, probably one of the main reason Bvb never had that winning spirit you need. also ok, wow, he didnt leave although he had other offers. wow. are they really so low in self esteem that this is such a big thing?\n\nI really wanted Dortmund to score in the first half. The game would have been way more interesting. I think Madrid still would have won, but at least we would see some kind of battle.\n\nDortmund always bottle it. Just remember last Bundesliga season.\n\nBut but but... Messi is nothing without Barcelona, and Penaldo is carrying Real Madrid.\n\nThat didnt age well innit?\n\nRent free man. Talk all the shit you want, just by mentioning y‚Äôall are making him immortal.\n\nLmao cry\n\n‚ÄúDeserved‚Äù this sub is full of losers smh\n\nNo one liked that"

    "all_comment_text": "That‚Äôs two weeks in a row that PL VAR officials have looked at footage of someone having at someone else‚Äôs neck and decided it‚Äôs absolutely fine.\n\nThat's a great observation.\n\nLet's wait for the bs response regarding this and how it could but we can't prove how much intent there was.\n\nThat's the bizarre thing, I'm sure previously the intent and severity didn't matter. \n\nPut your hand on someone's neck, or gently push your head into another person's head, didn't matter how soft it is, red card.\n\nTbh, I do think some soft ones should be let go and even the person overreacting punished instead. But neither this one or the one last week fall into that category.\n\nNot quite, the rule is a little more nuanced than that.\n\nIn addition, a player who, when not challenging for the ball, deliberately strikes an opponent or any other person on the head or face with the hand or arm, is guilty of violent conduct **unless the force used was negligible**.\n\nThe Joelinton one this week should 100% have been a red, but Schar last week barely touched him and there was no force.\n\nBy the one last week I was meaning the Mosquera hand on Havertz neck, not the Schar one, I didn't word that clearly, sorry. \n\nBut that's what I was trying to say, generally ones like Schar's are given as a red even though they barely touch them. \n\nI don't think they should be given, if anything I think the player overacting should be punished for trying to con the ref and gain an advantage.\n\nBut they are generally given even if the \"force used is negligible\" which makes the two neck gripping ones that did seem forceful and not result in reds seem so inconsistent.\n\nYeah I meant the Mosquera one.\n\nsexual assault is OK. as thiago Silva said. \"This is not even allowed in the UFC...‚Äù but its cool for these clowns from PGMOL\"\n\nYeah tell that to Casemiro...\n\nSchar's wasn't a red card though\n\nBy the one last week, I was meaning the Mosquera hand on Havertz neck, I wasn't very clear on that, sorry\n\nYeah, i know which one you meant. I was just saying the Schar one was simulation. Why VAR did not overturn that is a mystery\n\nYeah, I agree, that should have been punished the other way as simulation.\n\nAt least they're consistent now I guess\n\nThe officials spent ten years watching Harry Kane cleaning out defenders legs while they were in the air and thought that was fine too, they need to be educated on degrees of danger.\n\nThey need some form of reorientation to understand what safety is all about during games, especially when some types of tackles are involved.¬†\n\nPhysical sports like rugby and handball are sports where you‚Äôre allowed to do things that hurt as long as they‚Äôre not dangerous. But if you do something dangerous it doesn‚Äôt really matter what happens, you‚Äôre gonna get penalised simply because you did something dangerous. \n\nOne example is how goalkeepers rushing out of the penalty area to stop counter attacks is refereed in football and handball. In handball goalkeepers are basically banned from doing that since it creates insanely dangerous situations where the goalkeeper and attacker are running at each other from different directions, with the attacker often looking over his shoulder in order to receive the ball. \n\nGranted, things like that doesn‚Äôt happen that often in football, but it does happen occasionally, and when it does all that counts is who got the ball first. \n\nFootball in general tends to turn a blind eye to dangerous and reckless stuff as long as nothing bad happens. It‚Äôs not so much the intent that counts, but the outcome. \n\nI‚Äôd like to see a difference in football where you‚Äôd be allowed to get physical as long as it‚Äôs in a safe way, but where it would get harshly penalised if you‚Äôre doing something dangerous, like the stuff Harry Kane is doing. \n\nKai Havertz tackle on Sean Longstaff last year is another great example of what I mean. In my book that was one of the most reckless and dangerous tackles I‚Äôve ever seen. For those that don‚Äôt remember it Havertz came running at full speed and at a 90 degree angle to Longstaff when he tackled him with at least one leg stretched out. Havertz ever up barely touching Longstaff, but if he‚Äôd been just milliseconds later Longstaff‚Äôs knee would have been separated from the rest of his body and his career would probably have been over. \n\nHavertz got a yellow card for that and most people seem to have found that it was the right call. If a handball player had done something similar they'd have gotten a ten match ban. \n\nCombine that with the fact that footballers can get a red card for absolutely silly things sometimes and you'll hopefully understand my point completely. \n\ntl;dr: football gives red card for things based on outcome rather than danger when it ought to be the other way around.\n\nI think you've missed the whole point. \n\nThe fact that a player got hurt or injured doesn't mean that an opposing player need to get penalised for it. Accidents happen. \n\nLikewise a player shouldn't have to get injured or hurt in order for the opposing player to get penalised. Reckless and dangerous behaviour should always be penalised. \n\nMuch tougher and rougher sports like rugby and handball understands that and whilst tough and rough play is allowed, the moment it strays into dangerous it'll be penalised. \n\nFootball is almost all about whether it hurt or not, which I believe is one of the reasons why diving and simulating is so widespread. It's almost as if referees are taught to make their judgments based on how hurt a player is (pretending) to be.\n\n&gt;based on outcome rather than danger\n\nBut it's difficult to ascertain outcome without the outcome occuring. \n\nThere have been rather innocuous tackles uch as just pulling a player back that has resulted in leg breaks. Son vs Gomes comes to mind.\n\nNo one is talking about the Arsenal one anymore. Most media brushed it off or didn't mention it. His head bounced off the floor with the initial force, then the prolonged nature following.\nThis incident is dangerous in a different way, as running and other forces /vulnerabilities etc.. Madness from the referee's, and no excuses now with VAR really..\nWe need to bring in 3x calls from the managers to check, as its much harder for the refs to be forced to watch this and then refuse it (and maybe opens them up to liability even, but only in these extreme examples - but we've seen teams mumble it due to point losses and poor game changing decisions..)\n\nCommitted literal SA and not even a yellowüíÄ\n\nIt‚Äôs insane, because VAR exists precisely to catch shit like that that the ref doesn‚Äôt see\n\nBut the existence of cameras with slow-mo can‚Äôt make up for incompetent people being in charge of using them\n\nIt‚Äôs fine just wait for whoever does it to a city player  then it will be the first red\n\nIt wasn't Casemiro, so no red. Obviously /s\n\nThey don't want to stick their neck out to do the right thing and upset the boys club at PGMOL.\n\nI agree with the first take reaction.  Feels like a red.  However!  As I step back from the knee jerk reaction and consider what it‚Äôs like to have your legs chopped out from behind, per most ‚Äòprofessional fouls‚Äô in this scenario (where your aim is to slow them down and take them down however possible) ‚Äî I think the chop down to the legs is actually more dangerous and likely to cause harm to a player.  This looks worse, but I don‚Äôt really think it is‚Ä¶\n\nThen Casimero grabs a throat for 1ms and he‚Äôs out\n\nThat was fucked, nobody asked for that sending off, nobody wanted it and nobody expected it. There‚Äôs been loads my grievous examples since that haven‚Äôt been red carded.\n\nProbably because they are not Casemiro.\n\nIf that was Casemiro he would have been banned for the season\n\nWe have VAR but they couldn't call that?\n\nHe was watching to see if referee gave try or no try!\n\nEven in rugby that would have been a straight card\n\nYes. Zero mitigation. Straight off. Likely bans for future matches also.\n\nThat‚Äôs also a penalty in American football. How this wasn‚Äôt carded is odd.\n\nCoote is responsible for so many high profile gaffs...it's hilarious\n\nThe ref was horrible! Some of those calls where none sense\n\nNo. The bag of money jingling in their purse made them blind.\n\nBetween this and that Wolves lunatic and his choking antics last week these are probably more egregious than any missed red all last year\n\nThat same bloke put in some dodgy tackles today vs chelsea aswell, will be very surprised if I don‚Äôt see him getting a few red cards at some point he seems like a nutter\n\nWell don‚Äôt forget Guimaraes running full speed and landing an elbow on the back of Jorginho‚Äôs head\n\nThat wasn‚Äôt great, but i‚Äôm genuinely struggling to think of a worse one than the choke - that was just straight up malevolent\n\nIn rugby that‚Äôs a red card without even checking the TMO(VAR)\n\nHigh degree of danger and no mitigation. Straight red\n\nEmbarrassing isn't it\n\nIn football too. EPL referees and VAR just dogshit.\n\nYeah I was gonna say even we can't do that\n\nIn volleyball, it‚Äôs also a red card.\n\nHow could anyone see it and not think its a straight red is completely beyond my comprehension\n\nDefinitely a red in football (or should have been) but rugby is a completely different sport (obviously). You could apply that logic to almost any sport.\n\nIt‚Äôs the fact that even rugby which is by far a more violent sport would red card a takle like that but somehow the ref of this football match decided diferently.\n\nI agree it was an awful decision. But your analogy can be used with most sports. Arm around the neck!  This is the 100m hurdles!\n\nFull contact hurdles could save the Olympics mate.... i know id watch!\n\nFull contact triathon? dressage? On second thoughts no, horses are cool \n\nMaybe the skeet shooting would get messy \n\nBut we could be onto something here\n\nThe Javelin might take things a bit far mind you, but this does sound better than the 'Enhanced Games' that people have talked about doing\n\nDefinitely. Enhanced games doesn't bare  thinking about. But our idea my some legs, maybe not for long for the athletes ü§î\n\nFull contact figure skating, everyone skates at the same time, that I would watch.\n\nHahah would be a bloodbath!\n\nRugby and football are sports in which players from oposing teams have contacts with eachother unlike 100m hurdles where cards dont even exist.\n\nIce hockey?\n\nIt's only the 2nd week and there have already been some terrible fouls that have been overlooked. Dangerous fouls... overlooked....\n\nAnd we have fucking VAR (for 3 years running now) still incapable of any thing constructive... they blame the technology and not the humans operating it.\n\nIt‚Äôs the ref not VAR that‚Äôs the issue\n\nIt‚Äôs both actually¬†\n\nNah var seems to work everywhere else.\n\nThank God for those blue circles\n\nProbably for those in denial.ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\n\nHaven't seen any arguing it. Bournemouth got done dirty today\n\nMate you should see Twitter, seen some Newcastle fans call this a ‚Äúlove tap‚Äù\n\nThink it‚Äôs actually the other way around, you should just stay off Twitter.\n\nstraight up red, we got very lucky he's not getting a long ban\n\nHe should be banned at least for next weekend\n\nThe referee?\n\nBoth...Ref and Joelinton\n\nCan he get a retrospective ban? Not sure how it works these days.\n\nI‚Äôm not sure he can because ref saw the incident and punished him how he saw fit\n\ni don't think so, because the ref gave him a yellow and saw the incident that's it.\n\ni'm not certain, but i think the fa can only punish a player post game if he got a red, or the ref didn't see the incident.\n\nWell obviously the ref didn‚Äôt see the incident, or he would have given a ‚Ä¶ (sigh)\n\nMad. But expected it to be the way. Thanks.\n\nNo injury so I‚Äôm doubtful\n\nThere's a cynical foul and then there's this. Also how clear and obvious this is too, it's an easy decision for VAR to step in here.\n\nEdited as I don't know how to spell cynical.\n\n\"Sinical\" haha\n\nAbsolute brain fart right there üòÇ\n\nI hear you, it worked haha\n\nThe way he nodded at the yellow with no complaints shows he knew he deserved a red.\n\nI‚Äôm a Newcastle fan, but holy shit were Bournemouth done dirty in injury time. The goal and this.\n\nThat wasnt a goal, it hit the players bicep. That's the rules so it's not being done dirty, as for joelinton situation, yes it was a red card offence, so he got off lightly, not that being sent off would of benefited Bournemouth much anyway, because it was right at the end of the game.¬†\n\nWhen did the sleeve rule change mind? Because all I can see in replays is it‚Äôs virtually on the sleeve badge\n\nFrom what I can gather, that was never actually the rule but it's what sky sports were telling us the rule was\n\nThere is no \"Sleeve Rule\"! That- like the two feet challenge is a colloquial interpretation of the law. Handball is anything below the crux of the armpit.\n\nAlso a Newcastle supporter but my God were Bournemouth dirty in terms of constant fouls stopping the game. They never seemed to stop!\n\nThey were bullying us non stop. Think their whole game was to rough us up, and it clearly worked. Back line looked shook, especially Burn.\n\nThoughts on Kelly? I thought he was awful. Poor defensively and looked terrified on the ball.\n\nYep, awful. It was a poor choice of signing, even on a free, and for all Hall‚Äôs defensive learning he still had to do he‚Äôs a far better option for our style of play going forward.\n\nIt was like Jamal Lewis was back in the side with all the passing backwards and poor one on one defending.\n\n20 fouls to NUFC‚Äôs 8. Christie faking injury when Bruno‚Äôs pinkie brushed his face to stop a dangerous attack. We all see things differently but big Joe didn‚Äôt maliciously do anything here, it‚Äôs a seatbelt tackle to slow the keeper down. Neto makes a bit of a meal of it. I‚Äôd be fuming if that goal was disallowed for us though, ok goes on of his arm but not like his arm goes to the ball or is flapping about.\n\nAs a Newcastle fan i can honestly say this was a red card. No bias. But also schar shouldn‚Äôt have gotten a red.\n\nBan him, for over three games for deliberately dangerous conduct\n\nLooks about Joelinton. He does stuff like that every fucking game.\n\nHe never gets punished for this nonsense. Does it so often, deserving of so many more red cards than he gets.\n\nWhen he done this I was like \"well, no way out of that one\".\n\nFucking refs man\n\nI think that's part of the problem. Players get reffed on their own specififc behavior scale rather than univerally.\n\nYep some players commit their first foul and instant yellow because of reputation.\n\nThey just make it so difficult for themselves. Further proof they're completely (PGMOL) useless.\n\nEveryone blaming VAR but the referee on the pitch should be seeing that as a red before VAR is even needed. He saw it and decided it was a yellow for some reason.\n\nCan‚Äôt defend this, was stupid and could have resulted in a nasty injury.\n\nLooks like a punch but it isn't\n\nit does not look like a punch, at all. It looks like he is putting his arm around his neck, which is he is, and its a straight red.\n\nThe boy could have been killed\n\nGreat tackle\n\nWhat tackle? All I see is a hug üòÖ\n\nIf you can can climb all over someone‚Äôs back and stoop them from jumping you can get away with you can do anything.\n\nThe one time where full speed looks worse than slow motion replay.\n\nThat‚Äôs hardly round the neck it‚Äôs over the shoulder lol, cynical foul to stop the counter attack and a yellow card\n\nNothing there. Just a tactical foul and arm a bit too high by accident.\n\nThat's not a tackle\n\nToon fan here. Probs the finest moment we'll see this season. Bloody brilliant. I'd be fuming if I were a Bournemouth fan.\n\nGame's back\n\nWe see this every week, more so on the halfway line on the break, looks worse than it is. Goalie got straight back up, no more than a yellow. People need to be a little less dramatic or watch a softer sport.\n\nCasemiro got a red for less\n\nTbf case grabbed the collar of his shirt and then the pair of them laughed about it ten seconds later.  There is no room for laughter on a football pitch\n\nProbably the friendliest red card of all time\n\nthe talk that need to be done:\n\n-it‚Äôs a red (everyone agrees, end of convo)\n\nI‚Äôm a Newcastle fan and that was ridiculous, straight red that\n\nThis is a red in fucking rugby ffs.\n\nWhat is it in Chess?\n\nWhat about tiddlywinks?\n\nIn Tiddlywinks it's acceptable de-motivation for the opponent. Tiddlywinks is an extremely mentally challenging sport and at the top level you have to look out for and try anything to put them off their game. We all know how vicious Pro Winks is.\n\nProbably more vicious than handball\n\nIt‚Äôs not though, it would be a penalty for a high tackle. My girls would have kept running if someone did that to them.\n\nPlenty of hysteria about this but he just holds him back looks worse than it was. \n\nPeople quoting rugby are fucking clueless too, at worst this is a seatbelt tackle which a ref might give a penalty for but would mostly play on these days.\n\nEdit: can't spell\n\nHe just grabbed the goalie to stop em taking a quick goal kick, it looked worse than it was and a booking was reasonable.\n\nThat's some WWE shit but if being that physical was standard and allowed every week i wouldn't have a problem. The officiating and the inconsistency is the issue, in the 'modern' game that's a straight red\n\ntactical foul, yellow\n\nHe hooked him around the neck though‚Ä¶. Tactical and violent\n\nHardly lol people are acting like it‚Äôs a rear naked choke\n\nA rear naked choke is also not allowed and would most likely result in a very lengthy ban from football.\n\nTactical fouls like this are usually a yellow. There's no violence in the contact, he's just putting his arm over the keeper's shoulder. It's the keeper's momentum that makes the arm slide up to the neck area. I think var would've stuck with the referee's decision either way.\n\nDon‚Äôt talk sense while people are pretending to be outraged because they don‚Äôt like the team - the 30 seconds of playing with 10 would have massively changed the result.\n\nSchar was sent off for the world's softest red card last week so I'm feeling this is kind of a poetic justice for us. Game was over anyway\n\nPushed his head into another player. Doesn't matter how soft it is, that's an auto red.\n\nIf that was the case why did the other player not get sent off as well, because he pushed his head into schars head at the same time, in fact, it looked like he initiated it.\n\nBrereton shot first\n\nSo exactly what Cucurella did today with a Wolves player but not a word was said about it because neither player decided to try and win an Oscar by throwing themselves down to the ground.\n\nOnly reason Schar was sent off is that he stayed on his feet whilst Diaz gave us all the antics\n\nBoth players pushed their heads into each other and no contact was made‚Ä¶.\n\n[deleted]\n\nGrabbing neck and fingering butt hole = fine\n\nTouch forehead slightly to other forehead = immediate red\n\nThe obvious move is to go for the neck as demonstrated here and last week. If you can't get enough force around their neck, sexually assault them. As long as you don't lightly touch their forehead, you're good.\n\nThe refs and VAR are such a fucking joke.\n\nAnd a player dropped like he‚Äôd been hit by a sniper last week to get Schar sent off. Let‚Äôs not act like we‚Äôre getting preferential treatment overall. VAR has cost us a lot of points over the last few seasons (not as much as Wolves!)\n\n60 minutes of playing with 10 for absolutely no reason and no-one cares. But we could have had to play for 30 seconds with 10 and everyone‚Äôs up in arms. The bias is unreal.\n\nRed card\n\nAs a Newcastle fan, I‚Äôm glad they didn‚Äôt call that a red.\n\nI've lost a lot of faith in refereeing today\n\nObvious red card. Yet another obvious VAR implementation error. The standard of refereeing and way VAR has been implemented in the EPL is a great indictment of how poorly the game is administrated on and off the field. Two weeks in,  the number of significant and obvious (with VAR) errors is already substantial. The inability or unwillingness of referees and their governing body to use VAR as effectively as it is in other sports only supports that. Other top flight leagues have done this far better.\n\nSo much more a red than what Sh√§er got sent off for last week\n\nThat might have meant to be a tactical foul, but it was really a clothesline foul.  It's a straight red without question.  If that happens to your goalkeeper, not matter what team, you're screaming RED card.\n\nLiterally nothing wrong with it. ‚ÄòKeeper should have gotten out of his way.\n\nWon the ball to be fair to him\n\nVAR is a joke now\n\nGreat to see the PGMOL's twitter account being active and clarifying the decision.... Oh wait\n\nIs that a horse collar in NFL?\n\nJust hugging it out mate\n\n\"Referees call\"\n\nAhh it's good to have football back\n\nIf you don't laugh it's just sad\n\nThe last five minutes of this otherwise entertaining game were absolutely shocking\n\n\"Tackle\" is the wrong word, that's prep for a damn WWE choke slam!\n\n\"im blind im deaf i wanna be a ref\" ah var decision\n\nH\n\nWe complained about the inconsistencies of VAR last season, and it looks like they've started where they left last season. I don't like it at all!\n\nVAR meet AI.\n\nI was watching the replay as a Newcastle fan and skipped ahead in the stream after this. I saw a red card being shown and thought it was fair. It took me a sec to realise that it was for one of the Bournemouth coaches lmao\n\nJoelinton is #AllElite\n\nWWF fans would be proud of that take down!\n\nThats legal in argentina\n\nA new season, same VAR BS.\n\nThe best football league got the worst refereesü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\n\nDon‚Äôt know how that was missed‚Ä¶\n\nThat‚Äôs a fucking choke hold not a tackle\n\nBrilliant challenge\n\nBarely a foul!\n\nNeck to hand\n\nI get that they‚Äôre maybe reluctant to use VAR too much because of fan reactions to it lately, but this was an easy slam dunk for any VAR official. Why do they always call when they don‚Äôt need to, but the moment that something VAR should be used for shows up it‚Äôs nowhere to be fucking found.\n\nDear boy deserves a stiff elbow to the jaw at some point.  Where is the hard nut when you need him.\n\nIt should be a yellow nothing less nothing more. Maybe even a talking to warning he won't hesitate to card him for anything else.\n\nA foul for sure but it‚Äôs not nearly the most egregious I‚Äôve seen\n\nStraight red. I was starting to think we have a season without too much drama but hey ho var is back baby\n\nclear red, but newcastle players get away with pretty much everything\n\nExcept Schar got a red last week for absolutely nothing while Wolves got away with choking. Apparently going for the neck is the move. \n\nI do agree that Newcastle typically gets an insanely favorable whistle with this red card type behavior (Bruno G elbow to the back of the head ahead from the ball), but I do feel the need to point out they got screwed with a very soft red last week.\n\nYeah I'm sure you put no thought into this comment. Just last week schar was sent off for a pathetic red card decision, so your just hating on Newcastle for the fun of it really.\n\nThat‚Äôs nonsense, another player play acted and we got a soft red card last week. \n\nAs is so commonly said ‚Äò‚Äôit evens out‚Äô‚Äô (for some clubs).\n\nIt didn‚Äôt even out - Newcastle played for an hour with 10 men last week due to a shambolic decision. This week in the 96th minute Joelinton could have seen red. \n\nWould you rather play with 10 for 60 minutes or less than 60 seconds?\n\nOh I agree, but that‚Äôs what everyone always says even though I don‚Äôt think it is ever actually evened out.\n\nNewcastle have lost a lot of points because of ref shambles (maybe not as many as Wolves).\n\nLike Schar did last week? Lol\n\nFunny that the Kiwi shares the Rugby tackle.\n\nNewcastle fan. Needs a long ban, absolute idiot.\n\nHi /u/Elysium_nz, your image submission is currently under manual review by the moderators to avoid low-content.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

But if Sch√§r isn't sent off last week then Joelinton gets sent off this week.\n\nBoth are red cards but I've seen so many people defend Sch√§r saying he shouldn't have received a red last week, maybe that got the refs a bit hesitant to give one this week"

    "all_comment_text": "Currently binge-watching youtube discussions about Man Utd's decline post-Ferguson and how the club keeps cycling through managers without getting back to the top of the Premier League with Ten Hag. But what I find really interesting - and genuinely surprising - is how much of an outlier Man Utd is in terms of its total number of title-winning managers throughout its history. And I don't think most people realize just how extreme this outlier status - in its entire history (dating back to the late 1800s) Man Utd have had only THREE managers who have won the First Division/Premier League.\n\n1. Ernest Mangnall (1908, 1911)\n2. Matt Busby (multiple First Division titles in the 50s and 60s)\n3. Alex Ferguson (13 Premier Leagues from 1993 to 2013)\n\nNow contrast that with some other European heavyweights - Real Madrid have won La Liga with 17 different managers. Barcelona have done it with 14 managers, most recently Xavi. Bayern Munich don't even properly track title-winning managers before the early 1960s, but they've had 16 different Bundesliga-winning managers since then.\n\nChecking in with the Italians, Juventus have had 15 different Serie A-winning managers, tied with Inter Milan, and just ahead of AC Milan on 14. It's similar story for domestic rivals like Liverpool (9) and Chelsea (5)\n\nHere's a fun stat - by the time Matt Busby started building his Man Utd dynasty in the 1940s, Arsenal already had three different managers who won the title, as many as Man Utd have today in 2024. And it's not just the European giants - even when we look at clubs that aren't usually considered heavyweights, the comparisons are still pretty surprising:\n\nAston Villa, have won the title with two managers, just one fewer than Utd. Same goes for Tottenham (for all the talk of them being \"Spursy\"). Even Sheffield Wednesday have two title winning managers. Today, with Pep Guardiola, Man City have surpassed United to have five title-winning managers in total. But even before their oil-money transformation, they were just behind United, with two title-winning managers (Joe Mercer and Wilf Wild).\n\nAnyway, the point I'm getting at, and the reason for this entire post, is that people think that United's current troubles in the post-Ferguson era are something new. But this misses a much deeper historical pattern - Manchester United has ONLY ever succeeded under long-serving visionary geniuses who not only coach the team but basically run the whole club. The last ten years are really nothing new - the fact that United are supposed to be one of the biggest clubs in the world, but they only have one more title-winning manager than clubs like Sheffield Wednesday, or Aston Villa is unbelievable. Without a once-in-a-generation figure who can keep the entire system together, Manchester United has never known how to manage itself. And we shouldn't be surprised if this continues for another 20 years until the next Alex Ferguson comes along...\n\nGood read, thanks for sharing\n\nExcellent points that I never realised! As an Arsenal fan also makes me feel better that it seems we have a couple good individuals steering the ship which could lead to extended stability in a post Arteta world.\n\nExactly! United basically got a one of a kind manager in SAF. But the Ferguson years were the aberration, not the other way around.\n\nIndeed and now they are reverting to their historical mean.\n\nThat is a really interesting observation, thanks for sharing\n\nI enjoyed this TedTalk\n\nüòÇüòÇ\n\nWell put!\n\nWe all fell in love with the Sir Alex Ferguson FC not Manchester United FC!¬†\n\nIt's not like United are this irrational being. It's an organisation that has a culture shaped by people. The people decide what the culture is.\n\nYeah. It‚Äôs a cute story but the post Ferguson behemoth should be doing better than it is and there‚Äôs no rational story of why not.\n\nI should have added that I am a United supporter, and I can see how in moments of frustration, you can look at the clubs history and wonder, \"is there any other way?\" There is another way, and a functional organisation should not have to require the stewardship of a Messiah who appears every 30 years or so.\n\nThat's an excellent analysis. There is nothing special about the club except for Ferguson in the last 60 years. They just happened to be winning as the premier league got more of a global audience\n\nReally interesting point well done for looking into this and from that angle. Would be interesting as well to look at if it‚Äôs only Man U who suffer this issue or are there other big clubs with the same ongoing problems. But seems your list of overseas clubs is fairly comprehensive.\n\nThat‚Äôs interesting information but it shouldn‚Äôt have bearing on the PL era club with a global brand. Ownership changes. As we saw with Liverpool who were languishing in mediocrity for a while, smart investment in the infrastructure and brand allows them to compete with bigger money teams. \n\nThe owners haven‚Äôt been active in building a strong and exciting football team. It‚Äôs the same approach as PSG who have the benefit of a weaker league but possibly equally shit as United. Arsenal under Kroenke were sort of similar but also were adapting to austerity to account for the move to the Emirates.\n\nGreat story but money played a much smaller role for most of the history of football. Now Man U is one of the richest clubs in the world and the gap is huge. Understandable that people think they should be doing better with that kind of wealth.\n\nVilla catching strays smh\n\nIt also seems like England itself is an outlier then? I wonder why that is - why the manager is so make or break in England in particular, even for wealthier and bigger teams, and why it‚Äôs seemingly necessary for them to truly be a long term manager in all respects rather than simply a coach that answers to the board.\n\n[removed]\n\nYou‚Äôre gonna get downvoted because you‚Äôre plainly wrong. \n\nMourinho has never finished more than three full seasons at any club in his entire career, his style burns players out by the end even at his peak and he prefers signing and working with established players usually. He‚Äôs the complete opposite of a long-serving visionary.\n\nThis is coming from a Chelsea fan, but I wouldn't necessarily say Mourinho was a missed opportunity for united. \n\nApart from mourinho's career tactic of spend big, win then move on to the next club, his style of football and management was not at all desirable by united. United wanted quick results after two failed attempts at management. I always called it the mouinho pattern and hated it when he was at Chelsea (even though I'll always love him for what he did there). \n\n* No long term vision - Mourinho was only ever focused on immediate results. \n* Transfers - Spend big and develop a squad with older players\n* Youth - Rarely incorporate any youth into the 1st teams (sometimes due to very strong competing players)\n* Play style - Defensively strong, and try maintain or grind out a low scoring win\n* He gets a lot of players wrong - IMO he has a history of letting important players go, criticizing them or lacking the ability to spot a young player that just needs some playing time....that partly goes back to not developing youth. Over his career look at how he handled the likes of De Bryune, Mata and Salah (Chelsea). Depay, Pogba and Mkhitaryan at united. Dare I even mention how he handled Casillas at Madrid. Danny Rose at spurs...... \n\nI still maintain he's been the best manager since Fergie left (highest win % and trophies if you count the community shield). But his style of sticking to the same 11 players every week, grinding them down, getting a low scoring win isn't was one would associate with united. I think that's what fobbed off a lot of fans and why the club sacked him.\n\nEdit: to comment on your points. Regarding moyes vs Mourinho? Moyes has a 53% w/r, mourinho's was 58%. And Mourinho is far from know for dealing with squads. As I pointed out above he's gotten a fair few wrong over the years and can be quite stubborn about it leading to key players departing.\n\n[removed]\n\nYou can't give someone long term command when that person is not made for it.\n\nMourinho would have left anyway for some reason.\n\nWanting quick results is fine but its not a long term plan. and going by OP's post united need more than instant results. Mourinho wouldn't have suited long term or left a good squad for the next manager. They'd have been in the same boat as when Fergie left united. \n\nI think depay at united was mourinho's fault, he left united and tore it up at Lyon. Hit the ground running immediately. \n\nAnd apologies. On the last part I meant hazard under mourinho's second spell at Chelsea. Hazard was at his lowest and not performing the way we all remember him.\n\nI think Mourinho‚Äôs similar to a Ferguson or a Clough in that he really needs total control to operate successfully, and none of his recent clubs have given him that. I really thought Roma would. If a manager of his stature doesn‚Äôt get that control at Fenerbah√ße, then tbh that model of management is completely dead and buried imo\n\nNo serious Club is going to give a Manager total control anymore, they're all moving towards a DOF and a Head Coach type situation. The only Managers who in recent memory have had high levels of control are probably Guardiola and Klopp and those two are generational managers who once they leave/left the Club could still function because the system was still strong. \n\nUnited need to move to that kind of system but they have been a circus off the pitch as much as on.\n\nUnited were nowhere near winning a league with Mourinho, they only came 2nd in 2018 because De Gea had the best goalkeeping performance ever.\n\nHe had the most expensive team in the world and they were playing like shit.\n\n[removed]\n\nAs a Manchester United supporter, I really appreciate your insight.\n\nThat's super fascinating.\n\nHow depressing, thanks for that! Lol!\n\nIs la liga a good comparison?\n\n That was a really good read, thanks for sharing. The question is then does Radcliffe and the likes on Ineos see that their role in the future success of the club is to develop and maintain that structure\n\nIt's Matt Busby, not Busy.\n\nWhen we kept screaming Glazers Out, everyone wanted to caveat with ‚Äòbut they spend money and back the managers‚Äô, not realizing that was never indicative of good ownership and leadership.\n\nGood shit mate.\n\nYou said something about ‚Äòtotal control over the club‚Äô . Surely ETH doesn‚Äôt have this so how was Ferguson given more controlling power than the managers post him?\n\nThank you for your insight into all this. Really hits the nail on the bead\n\nThe whole club needs a reset from top to bottom. It doesn't matter how many coaches you sack. The culture in that club is rotten and toxic and it sips down to the players. If i were to try give a simple solution, get rid of the glazers fully. Have ineos have 100% ownership and give them a chance to implement a new culture. Also get rid of some of those overpayed prima Donnas and stop paying premium wages to mediocre players\n\nHow do you get rid of under police investigation Antony on ¬£200k a week, inconsistent Rashford on ¬£300k a week, past it Casemiro on ¬£350k a week, injury prone Mount on ¬£250k a week though? Which club would pay those wages or close to those wages for these players, let alone a transfer fee on top?\n\nHave to do what arsenal did. Bite the bullet. Pay them off reset the culture of the playing and coaching staff and suck up the financial costs in the short term. If any club can afford to do that it‚Äôs Man Utd. They will get decent revenues regardless and they can use that to rebuild a new culture.¬†\n\nIt would cost ¬£37m to pay off Casemiro. (26 contract expiry)\nIt would cost ¬£30m to pay off Antony (27 contract expiry)\nIt would cost ¬£60m to pay off Rashford (28 contract expiry)\nIt would cost ¬£52m to pay off Mount (28 contract expiry)\n\nThat's approximately ¬£179m combined for these players. They are planning on building a new stadium, revamping Carrington, and investing in a squad rebuild. They don't have the money to do this.\n\nAn entirely self imposed issue\n\nBy Woodward, Judge, Arnold and Murtough yeah. It's not INEOS fault United didn't have modern structures in place for a big club before them, and didn't have people who understood football. It will take 3-4 years for United to sort out their squad properly in terms of wage structures.\n\nIt‚Äôs not Ineos‚Äô fault but they bought it with full knowledge of the situation.\n\nNo doubt, but is that the conversation? They're in this issue now it's about how do they right the ship, no point in them just being like yeah this is our fault and shrugging their shoulders\n\nJesus christ\n\nIn that case you almost have to bully them. So they want to leave.\n\nThat's why you always need someone like Roy Keane. He can be the bad cop and make it easier for the Club.\n\nI'd take all the amount of bullying for ¬£300k/wk\n\nYou would because you are earning near that nor have the possibility to earn near that.\n\nThese guys aren't staying around to train on their own at 7am on a Wednesday.\n\nConstructive dismissal, you mean?\n\nYou can do loan deals and sell players with an agreement to cover a portion of the wages over the duration\n\n remember Andreas now a starter in a EPL side right after a short loam to Flamengo? Do the same with Antony loam him out, he will cost half of that after.\n\nIt‚Äôs a lot of pain but thats kinda the point, cut the losses sooner rather than later. The one thing Utd do have going for them is significant commercial value revenue to the extent that they could swallow losses better than most. \n\nThat commercial value might start to slip away if they‚Äôre not careful as the brand becomes associated with failure, a new gen of fans is always emerging.\n\nThey don't have ¬£150m to spend buying players off contracts. They are building a new stadium, revamping Carrington and will be spending ¬£100m-¬£150m net spend each summer transfer window. Just not viable mate.\n\nSo the answer is a ‚Äòholding‚Äô man-manager for 2 years and just try to play within the squads limitations, play kids in the domestic cups and squeak out European places? \n\nIf thats the case you simply swallow it and wait. Either way it‚Äôs accepting the reality of the situation and making the best of it. \n\nEtH doesn‚Äôt really seem like the guy to do that.\n\nIn addition to this the ¬£150m is never absolute there are always some potential deals to be done to mitigate (or the club should be at least working their bollocks off to do so)\n\nYou don‚Äôt make all these mistakes in the first place. All of which can be assigned to Woodward.\n\nAgreed that the ownership is at the core of the rot. But INEOS is not the competent leadership the club needs. If they were any good, Nice would be thriving, or at the very least be improving. INEOS are less incompetent than the Glazers but the fact that they undermined ten Hag with their public search for another coach only to end up sticking with him because they couldn't get someone better speaks volumes about how INEOS themselves are not up to the job.\n\nI can see the going for Southgate and he will be just as shit, has had an excellent squad to pick players for England and still managed to fuck up the the entire left side of the squad\n\nThey aren‚Äôt going for Southgate. That rumour stems from a fucking Sun article. People ignore them generally except when it suits their narrative it seems.\n\nI honestly think Southgate could be good - not necessarily in terms of results, but definitely in terms of fixing the vibes and getting rid of the toxic elements. That was his biggest success at England, he really sorted out the wider problems from top to bottom and was also instrumental in improving the youth development structure which has paid dividends. He‚Äôs one of the reasons England has a good squad to pick from, he personally fast tracked players like Bellingham and Saka too (which in turn boosted those young players‚Äô careers, especially Bellingham, who really cemented his status at the World Cup)\n\nAgree whole heartedly with this, they should have taken action in summer, either fire or stick, instead they spent weeks completing a ‚Äúseason review‚Äù\n\nNot sure I agree. It‚Äôs way too early to judge Ineos. Ashworth, Wilcox, Berrada, Vivell only started in July. That‚Äôs also an exceptional group of footballing brains. They will create something good, but it will take longer than 10 weeks.\n\nJust look on Glassdoor about Radcliffe and INEOS\n\nNot INEOS, Jim Radcliffe. He holds the working class in such contempt I can't believe United fans welcomed him!\n\nThey've started this process. These things take time, lots of it.\n\n\nThey've brought in an entire new footballing board essentially from top to bottom, are building a new stadium, and redeveloping a new training ground.\n\n\nThey actually sold players quite well in the summer and cleared a lot of bloated wages off the books and replaced them with younger players on smaller wages.\n\n\nThey are ripping it up and starting new, but we're only 6 or 7 games in to the process.\n\nThis is it, it's not even the managers, mourinho came 2nd and won trophies and then the cycle continued, it's awful recruitment, bad owners and bad facilities. It's become a poisoned chalice\n\nIneos have control though. Glazers basically only takes out their dividens and sips margaritas at this point. Change will take time though.\n\nRead his current statement on Ten hag situation.\n\nWhos? Jims? Joels? u/familiar_surprise485?\n\nWe have needed a top to bottom reset for some time but you can‚Äôt expect something like that to magically happen overnight. We are well into that reset. The club on and off the field has gone through incredible amounts of change since the end of the 2022 season when half rangnick said we needed open heart surgery. The footballing side has been completely revamped on recruitment, training facilities etc. new CEO, new director of football, partially new owners and new board, 250 lay offs and major plans in the works for a new stadium as well.\n\n¬†the playing squad has been completely turned over since ten hag took over (15 permanent signings and 33 permanent departures). The current playing squad has about 6 players who were regulars in the team prior to ten hags arrival. One of those hasn‚Äôt been available for effectively an entire year (shaw), two of them were widely considered nowhere near good enough when ten hag took over and both arguably need to be replaced (Maguire and lindelof), one has improved considerably under ten hag and is now a regular starter when previously he was considered only a back up (Dalot) and the other two are our two star players who many within the fanbase believe are a big part of our problems (rashford and Fernandes).¬†\n\nOf the players to leave since ten hag came to the club, 2 didn‚Äôt need to be gotten rid of (elanga and mctominay). So of the players still here, 3 are good players who are regularly available (although even that is up for debate) and 2 players who have left could still be doing a job for United. That means 2 seasons ago we had a playing squad with 5 players who were going to be of any use in 2 seasons time, across the whole squad!\n\nThat is a total reset of the playing squad required, as you have said, but it is also a total squad reset 90% complete now after two and a bit years under ten hag.\n\nSo we are well on with the total club reset.¬†But this root and stem tearing apart and rebuilding takes time to see it come to fruition.\n\nsell the club to Qatar or Abu Dhabi\n\nThe Glazzers will never allow that to happen. It's why they are stuck with INOES now.¬†\n\n&gt; If i were to try give a simple solution, get rid of the glazers fully. Have ineos have 100% ownership and give them a chance to implement a new culture. Also get rid of some of those overpayed prima Donnas and stop paying premium wages to mediocre players\n\nSo your simple solution is a multi-billion pound buy out of people who clearly do not want to be bought out, magically get out of multi-million pound contracts of people who do not want to cancel their contracts, and improve scouting and recruitment (and transfer negotiations) over night? \n\nThere's many of the first steps to these things already in play, functionally the top level of the club is already completely transformed, however it takes a long long time for that to be visible on the pitch. (5+ years till they're in a title fight I reckon)\n\nThe fan culture is where it starts.\n\nEvery time i hear untd fans the are the most spoiled entitled (as a group, you might be fine, idk you) people ever. They deserve everythimg, they're the \"biggest club in the world\". Self-important, and they don't back their players. They'll have an amazing talent, then the mob will turn against them the minute they aren't ronaldo. It must be hell to be a united player.\n\nI don't really dislike the team but the fanbase drives me nuts.\n\nJim Radcliffe is one of the most toxic people in Britain! You honestly think things will change at United under him? Check out how he treats his staff and the working class.\n\n\nSooo many naive United fans here\n\nRelegation?\n\nHow many managers do we have to go through before we stop pretending ‚Äúthe only way out‚Äù is to change managers. Over a decade of this now and plenty of managers and just decline, I don‚Äôt think Ten Hag is the right manager, but we have a lot of other things to do in addition to a new manager to stand a chance of reversing the rot.\n\nJust stop buying players for ridiculous prices every season just because they have a fame attached.\n\nStart promoting academy players. Start scouting FFS. Find players available for low price but still good.\n\nLook at your neighbours, they bought Haaland for some 60-70m &amp; Julian Alvarez for 25-30m. For being cash strapped, they too are spending wisely. Stop buying players with bad personalities. Look at Klopp rebuilding Liverpool. He would check players for personalities &amp; never did we get any unnecessary drama off field &amp; on field.\n\nFuckin tear down your whole team &amp; start rebuilding. Anyways it is a mess, atleast being in mid table with work in progress team is still acceptable.\n\nEven worse, Alvarez was ¬£14m\n\nCity paid a lot, lot more to get Haaland than just his release clause¬†\n\nAre you referring to his wages?\n\nWages, signing on bonus, other bonuses, agent's fees, payment to his father.....\n\n‚ÄúStart promoting academy players‚Äù - you know the article is about Man United, right?\n\nExactly use the academy better tbh that‚Äôs where tactics begin identity of the team build it better that‚Äôs how ManU will survive tbh no idea y they didn‚Äôt start sooner\n\nAs a united fan, how are we not using the academy? I think we use our academy more than most teams in the top 10\n\nAnd you also spent like 600m on players in just recent years if the academy was actually good u wouldn‚Äôt have to spend that much - build a good academy promote players and then spend on what u don‚Äôt have\n\nHow well are you using your academy for revenue? City and Chelsea seem miles ahead on that front\n\nThe thing about promoting academy players and buying cheaper, less experienced players is, that it'll probably have to get worse, before it gets better. Are fans prepared to wait a year or two, before they get results?\n\nAston Villa...\n\nThere‚Äôs only one Emery tbf\n\nSome of this was done in the past transfer window but fans are already saying things like 'should have gone for more experienced striker'. 'Ugarte isn't good enough', etc..\n\nUsing Man City as an example isn't very great when their on trial for FFP.\nTheir real transfer fee's and wages are currently being scrutinised.\n\nAs much as I hate our current transfer policy, it's been a problem since we went overboard on the Di Maria, Pogba, Lukaku, Maguire signings.\n\nEven when we target players spicfic for a position, we overpay regardless. Foreign teams know Man United generate the highest revenue so they would take advantage.\n\nThe manager clearly has no idea what to do, so the players have given up on him.\n\nWhatever the outcome of the FFP trial is, you can't deny that City have a clear system that identifies the right players for the team. They have more hits than misses under Pep when it comes to the transfer market.\n\nThis was probably the smartest decision bringing in Pep compared to when they got Manicini and Pelligrini.\n\nHe was going to implement a 4-3-3 possession style game. From the top to the bottom. So they scouted and recruited that fit that specific system. \n\nYou're right more hits than misses. But we can't deny a team that replace a 50CB with another 50CB or a 50M with another 50RB or a 50m DM with another 50m DM. Or have the luxutury to bench a 100m winger with another 50M winger.\n\nAll while thinking this small club is generating more than 4B in renevues. The FFP mostly relates to wages that are not correct.\nLike the olden days, when owners used to put notes in players shoes while they were showering.\n\nHow much have United spent? Legally or illegally, United can easily match City when it comes to spending. They have spent at least as much as City have under Pep and gone around in circles because they spent it building 3 different squads for 3 different managers. The results speak for themselves.\n\nAntony for 100 or alvarez for 14? City is a perfect example\n\nExactly learn to put things into context.\n\nAt the time, ETH was going mental for HIS players, Greenwood done for Rape, Sancho done for being useless. Rather than get a cut price from Ajax at 50m. We held out and it backfired so we paid over the odds.\n\nAlverez was bought for ¬£15m as a teenager and loaned back. Man United wouldn't be able to offer that. Plus look at the wages Alverez was given and the signing on fee.\n\nEven at 14M Anthony would have been a flop. Its not only overpaying, its also the wrong players. Ohh its ronaldo, ah no its sancho, its always something. Your club needs an atomic bomb from top to bottom and rebuild sloooowly. Good luck\n\nBased on what logic. Hindsight is a hitch right.\n\nAt the time, we had no RW. As mentioned before. Greenwood on trial, Sancho a natural LW being shifted to the right, and Amad was still too young to start.\n\nLike most managers, they insist on bringing their players. At the time Antony was a quality player for Ajax.\n\nYou don‚Äôt judge the quality of decisions on the outcome, you do it on the process to make it.\n\nNone of the poor transfers need to rely on hindsight either. They were clearly poor choices, and too expensive *as it was clearly known at the time*.\n\nReddit was full of Ajax badges telling everyone that they did not care about Anthony at all, they were sad about Lisandro but every Eredivise\nwatcher was already laughing when the rumors started, let alone when the deal closed for that amount. You can search for the old posts, this is not hindsight- there was already foresight \n\nWhatever man, denial is the dna of the club since the issues started and you‚Äôre projecting exactly this lol.\n\nMaking De gea leave to get onana was also an insane waste of money and time, there were other issues first. Signing Casemiro for so much money was also stupid. Anyone with half a brain could see this as soon as it happened, not insight.\n\nBro please don't be stupid. You're basing your argument on reddit fans with an Ajax badge.\n\nThey were happy because they were going to get 90m off a 10m transfer. That would set the club up for life.\n\n25G in 82 appearances for a RW, that's not including Assist. He was one of their main players en route to the semi final, and won 2 Dutch league titles. \n\nAny team would be upset to lose their main CB, after losing their main CB the year prior. \n\nIt's not about denial, I know his been shit. I'm not denying that fact. My point is Man United are always going to pay over the odds for any player. Mediocre or World class.\n\nYou are man united for fuck‚Äôs sake. You should buy players that are smashing the league, especially a non top 4 league. \n\n25g in 82 is fine but that is not numbers that make you go wow this guy needs to come to utd. 25g is also kinda easy when you‚Äôre playing for ajax as they dominate the league. \nSancho deal made more sense, but you got unlucky with that one. Didn‚Äôt background check.\n\nYou don‚Äôt agree? \n\nLiverpool got salah for 40m, he scored 34 goals and assisted 22 in 83 games for roma. For roma, not juventus. Serie A is way more competitive and Roma is not a top 3 club. These are the transfers that pay off, these are good numbers. Look how every liverpool signing works off. How is this possible and every utd signing goes to shit?\n\nEven 50 million was too much. Ole's team estimated that he was at most a ¬£25 million player. The moment the asking price went above ¬£30 million they should've walked out. Even without the knowledge of the fact that Antony would completely flop, he was never in a million years going to live up to being a ¬£50 million, let alone a fucking ¬£80 million player. It's honestly perhaps the worst signing I've ever seen. Seriously, you look at lists of the worst signings ever and the only thing preventing him from being worse than people like Danny Drinkwater is the fact that he's still at United so it's too early. Insane high wages (what fucking club increases a player's wages by 10 times when they join a new club?), a high fee on the level of people like Bellingham, and embarrassing stats.\n\nI think the overall point was EVEN City who are probably the ones who need to least, are being careful when they spend their money\n\nOi‚Ä¶. Stop giving them clues, you‚Äôll ruin it.\n\nIt is increasingly funny. Like the late Wenger days at Arsenal when they keep making the same dumb mistake over and over\n\nTelling Man United of all clubs to start promoting academy players is pretty funny tbh.\n\nWe missed the chance to get Duran for 10mill recently\n\nIf you mean 18 months ago, then yeah, but it‚Äôs obvious why he chose to go elsewhere\n\nOne player that was actually alright for the price yet then got injured for a whole season yet not back yet is Malacia but even then will see as a terrible signing for being out injured for so long. \n\nBelieve that Antony is one of the worst transfers in the history of United.\n\nI mean there are players who don‚Äôt really really put match winning performances in all teams including the top ones. But they hold on to the average to above average performances throughout multiple seasons.\n\nBut they don‚Äôt grab unnecessary attention. They don‚Äôt bring in negative feedback. They don‚Äôt bring in drama.\n\nTrue in both of your comments though. \n\nTrouble is as Woodward giving out massive contracts to the likes of Martial and Jones that constantly injured rather than moving on when they didn't play and shouldn't have renewed their contracts. \n\nRemains the same as other players they cannot shift due to high wages, Utds own demise let alone results tbf.\n\nCannot believe a post that describes sportswashing City as ‚Äúcash-strapped‚Äù gets even a single upvote.\n\nI assume they don't know what that word means\n\nI think United have one of the better academy‚Äôs in the world and definitely use academy players a lot more than most prem clubs\n\n&gt;Look at Klopp rebuilding Liverpool. He would check players for personalities &amp; never did we get any unnecessary drama off field &amp; on field.\n\nWe had a fair bit of off field drama under Klopp but admittedly it was more often existing players than ones he signed. Every club has off field drama of some sort\n\nI agree with you but just have to point out Haaland had a buyout clause. No way was he going for less than ‚Ç¨100 million without it.\n\nAbsolutely clueless, Haaland cost at least double that in agents fees etc.\nUnited were interested in Alvaerz but he preferred to go to city.\n\nPretty sure it is edwards that is credited for his extensive research before buying players, not klopp\n\nYou‚Äôre about 2 years too late for this comment\n\nDamn, I am putting this comment on ManUtd posts since VanGaal time. We know Mourhino is bit problematic, but they could have used him for rebuild.\n\nLet‚Äôs not count number of wins &amp; losses. But in the player selection &amp; transfers department; this is not the legacy that SAF has left.\n\nThis is generally on point, but if you believe Haaland cost City exactly 60m to 70m all fees paid over the table, then I have a bridge to sell you\n\nSo many managers have come, some of them even proven winners and none of them have been able to get ManU going. So many big signings made and barring may be 2 to 4 of those 'big money' signings, all of them have failed to deliver and in most cases, even performed poorly. \n\nAt this rate, you can keep changing managers and bringing in new players and they will keep on performing worse. \n\nI dont know, I feel like there are some behind the scenes issues perhaps, that we arent aware of. May be the leadership has too much say in the transfers. May be the management interferes too much and it undermines the manager. I dont know. They have spent so much money, brought in so many people and no one can get ManU functioning even half decent, to at least be competitive.\n\nAnyhow, its really fun to watch.\n\nEither spend like Chelsea or go back to newton heath been saying this for a decade\n\nThey need to get rid of 90% of the squad but nobody is going to buy them so they'd have to pay them off. Then spend another billion on new players on incentive based contracts. Get rid of everyone including the backroom staff. \n\nBasically what Boehly did at Chelsea. The problem is for them, even United can't afford to do that. Chelsea were in a unique position with money to burn. \n\nBasically they're buggered.\n\nFor a few years there it was quite fun to see them stumble but now it's just getting sad.\n\nNothing is working for them right now. I don't know who to blame again.¬†\n\nSAF must have sold his soul to the devil because wtf is going on with this club! It‚Äôs been a steady decline since SAF left and now it looks like they are at rock bottom. \n\n‚ÄúIn this moment, I admire them both. They play really fantastic football, but you can always see that an era can come to an end.‚Äù\n- Erik Ten Hag\n\nu/therealoc1 is spot on but I would add that on top of that Utd have spent hundreds of millions on unsellable players so will inevitably have to spend that once again to build up a squad that can compete for the prem and UCL. On top of a new stadium. I don‚Äôt see United seriously challenging for another 10 years at the very least unless something crazy happens.\n\nI think the ‚Äúwe‚Äôre Manchester United‚Äù is actually very damaging for them. The level of recent success (last 25 years) means they have an expectation, no matter how much of a mess they‚Äôre in, that they will be successful.\n\nThis manifests in an inability to go through a self imposed bleed phase where they do a Ralph suggested and completely gut and reset.\n\nInstead they are in a perpetual cycle of patching over cracks rather then ripping the fucker down and rebuilding from scratch.\n\nWeird how eg Madrid don‚Äôt have that problem tbh\n\nMy issue has never been to do with them spending money or backing managers. It‚Äôs the brutal incompetence. No other club in the world has as many immediate ‚Äúwell that‚Äôs a shit decision‚Äù moments as us right now. You can see every signing, every squad decision and just think about how obviously wrong they are. Every old player we bring in hoping they will change the culture, all the young players we spend on ( who are always the totally unproven prospects, can we not just sign someone where we can see legit talent? And not just ‚Äúwell if he learns how to do that he will be good.‚Äù) just relentless stupidity\n\nAs long as the players haven‚Äôt downed their tools, I still don‚Äôt mind if ten Hag stays at the moment. (Although idk, in some cases it does look like they‚Äôre just going through the motions) \n\nI think they need both someone who can get them playing a better style of football (I mean, what the hell are all these goals we‚Äôre conceding), and, even more importantly, a coach who is the biggest personality in the locker room. Zidane is an example of that. Someone with charisma (I feel like ten Hag doesn‚Äôt do too well here), isn‚Äôt afraid of benching a player (ten Hag meets this criteria), and someone who has a real hairdryer on him (think ten Hag badly fails here) to the point where the players are afraid of him (Roy Keane, Ferguson). \n\nI don‚Äôt see anyone like this available to lead the team. I‚Äôve joined the ‚Äúten Hag out‚Äù club but who else is there to lead at the moment? Most of these players (especially Rashford, he‚Äôs the absolute worst example of this) just don‚Äôt look like they‚Äôre constantly switched on. \n\nKlopp would‚Äôve been such a good coach for this team. When Salah didn‚Äôt want to track back or defend he got asked if he thought he was better than Messi, because only Messi could stay still and do nothing and still be the best player on the pitch. Everyone else had to put in a shift. That shut him up and he still defends to this day. \n\nRashford got let off the hook by Mourinho (somewhat) and then completely by Ole too, who wanted him to conserve his energy so he could be ready for the counter at any point. But he‚Äôs no Ronaldo (for whom Mourinho did this as well, at Madrid) and his counters sure as hell don‚Äôt end up in a goal or assist all the time, and it just looks as if he‚Äôs constantly shifting between these two states, even in a single phase of play. \n\nReally tough situation on INEOS‚Äô hands here, but surely, it should get better with time since they‚Äôre, importantly, working on the infrastructure. Rome wasn‚Äôt built in a day and all that.\n\nIt's a locker room full of people who have so much wealth that neither they or their kids ever have to work again. What the fuck are you talking about? \"Fear,\" as you lazily describe it, is no longer a factor and cannot be used as a motivator.\n\nIt‚Äôs not a factor in THIS case, which is my point. If you think these players aren‚Äôt afraid of getting completely dressed down by their coaches (Klopp, Guardiola, Conte, Ferguson) then you just don‚Äôt understand how this works. \n\nBut those coaches earned that fear. You can‚Äôt disrespect your boss and have everything be all hunky dory. Ronaldo got his ass thrown out, so did Sancho. They‚Äôre examples of the type of player you‚Äôre talking about and wouldn‚Äôt last in the sort of team I‚Äôm talking about. My point is, the manager NEEDS to have the biggest ego in the room and the players need to accept that first and foremost, so everyone buys into the coach‚Äôs (whoever it is) philosophy.\n\nYou had all that in Jose and didn't back him.\n\nHaha I wasn‚Äôt sitting on the board then but yep, they didn‚Äôt back Mourinho when he needed it. He really could‚Äôve done great with this team if everything had gone well. \n\nBut he (and Rangnick) had the most toxic dressing room I‚Äôve seen. Just a bad bunch of players. His Chelsea and Inter sides would‚Äôve died ‚Äî figuratively speaking, of course ‚Äî for him on the pitch.\n\n&gt;I think they need both someone who can get them playing a better style of football (I mean, what the hell are all these goals we‚Äôre conceding),\n\nWould you be willing to see a coach who plays 'boring football' get the job? I'm sure a section of fans, media and neutrals won't appreciate it.\n\nI think ten Hag wants to play like Liverpool with the rock and roll style Klopp talked about as soon as he came in, but because of the players we have it‚Äôs looking more like kamikaze football. \n\nBut right now I think everybody (the fans I mean) would want the defence to sort itself out so we stop leaking goals. Ten Hag‚Äôs first season was great in this respect and that‚Äôs what one builds on. He‚Äôs lost that, so I think it needs work again.\n\nExactly we just need to wait tbh\n\nChanging coaches will delay the inevitable again¬†\n\nSouthgate\n\n[removed]\n\nFake fan if you think Southgate is the answer lol\n\nOr not a Utd fan. The rest of the prem would love to see it!\n\nHaha, Southgate would be such a great way to continue things as they are at utd. I'm all for it!\n\n\nSeriously, I will die on the hill that no manager, or handful of signings is going to change things for utd. They need a monumental cultural and strategic shift. Southgate, a manager already with a maligned reputation (in spite of what most would refer to as reasonable success), would just amplify all the confirmation bias around him when he inevitably struggles and he'd be given even less time than someone that no one is familiar with as a result. He'd be a terrible appointment. It'd be entertaining, but terrible.\n\nterrific complete chop skirt butter library file scary long drunk\n\n *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev/home)*\n\nWas just a joke from a non Utd fan. Would be a funny next step in the saga. \nIn all honesty though, I dont know what is going on at that club. Spend loads, change the manager, change the players, even change the board and it just goes on.\n\nThey‚Äôd be better off appointing him as a backstage ‚Äòfix the vibes‚Äô guy than making him their actual coach\n\nAre you serious lol\n\nThere is no easy way out for united . That being said their best course of action is actually to slug out a season with ten Haag and see if he can make things click like maresca.\n\nHowever ineos needs to take a few matters into their hands :\n\n1. Completely remove transfers from ten Haag , get his requirements and then get the players the data team thinks is the best .\n\n2. Decide on a philosophy and have ten Haag adhere to it , if he can't he should resign .philosophy should change only if the manager is at the same pedigree level of say pep, klopp , Mourinho etc .\n\n3. Start a clean out based on point 2 and factors like fitness , attitude , age . I'd say rashford , Fernandes , anthony , casemiro , shaw , Maguire , lindeolf , evans all gotta go .\n\n4. Revaluate the credentials of all existing departments especially their medical dept .\n\n5. Get former players like Keane, evra , Ferdinand , Neville some coaching capacity role be it even part time . United right now need all the help from them to re establish that united way .\n\n6. Get the captain right, among all the current lot the only one who actually seems to be giving it his all and be rational and honest is Eriksen and perhaps Martinez . They should be captain ahead of everyone else .\n\n United is finished. They are basically AC Milan with money.\n\nMilan won the league two years ago.....so I dunno what you mean\n\nLast time I checked AC Milan had a lot of internal problems and aren‚Äôt doing too well in Int. competitions\n\nWe made the semi final of CL 1 years ago... Milan in 2014 is what you're describing Milan actually has a project now\n\nLast time i checked Milan won the league two years ago, while Man Utd last won it 11 years ago‚Ä¶\n\nIt's the curse, there's no way out for the devils\n\nWell, you're not the first person to say it. De Gea said it when he was playing for the team.¬†\n\nthey should have just got ancelotti in when fergie left, like he recommended. there would have been no transition period. ancelotti every bit as good and would have spent the one billion quid better.\n\nI love seeing serious publications writing pieces on united‚Äôs downfall. Have they been relegated? No. Not yet. I say yet because there‚Äôs a chance they will in the near future. Why? The debt. They are sitting on a total debt of around ¬£1bn give or take. The glazers have always funded transfers the manager needs. Yeah it‚Äôs not out of their pocket but PSR rules (voted in by many of the PL clubs) will prevent that now united‚Äôs income is under threat. The debt they have will eventually drag them under. No sane business person will buy that amount of debt plus whatever the club is worth. \nOne other completely logical reason that United are mediocre is that football moves in cycles. One day you‚Äôre the big dog, the next you‚Äôre fighting for scraps. United had their day, as did Liverpool in the 70‚Äôs and 80‚Äôs. Maybe one day they‚Äôll find success again. The sooner people accept that United aren‚Äôt the force they were, the sooner they can accept the truth. Clinging onto history isn‚Äôt helping\n\nLiverpool have been relatively consistent in winning cups and leagues throughout their history, Man Utd are more inconsistent and always have been. They are just reverting to their historical mean.\n\nMan United need Todd boehly who would come in and strip the entire club from top to bottom including back room staff at like level employment\n\nFind 4 people that have the same prophecy?\n\nlol it‚Äôs only been 6 games\n\nIt'll be tough for them because they've already been away from the top for far longer than they'd like but they need to focus on youth and only bring in up and coming players to develop until they shift their dead wood (if they can) or let their contracts expire. Their so-called resets since Fergie left have just been largely a series of ill thought out botches.\n\nHonestly, I thought Casemiro was a stupid signing; you could see that he had a lot of miles on his legs and thinking he would last more than another year or two at a high level was delusional at best. Sure enough, he looked good for a little bit and then aged in dog years in a very costly way.\n\nWhat I am saying is that I absolutely agree with you. At this point, they shouldn't sign anyone older than about 24 until they can clean out the roster.\n\nStick to the plan and bounce back?\n\nRashy gotta go. Highest earner in the club and he looks like he doesn‚Äôt even want to play most of the time.\n\nHe was great vs porto. (not a utd fan)\n\nWell man u didn't listen to fans. Also they rush to get into bidding wars with other clubs. Add to that they don't know how to say no to an agent who is asking 20 mill for commissions on an average player whose profile has been hyped up by. If manU stop doing this  they might be able to save themselves. Buy players for the role you want fulfilled.. not because another club is bidding for them.\n\nJust hire Southgate. Give him what he wants\n\n‚ÄúHag at the wheel !‚Äù\n\nTen Hag needs to become Super Sayian\n\nLet me guess: Sack ETH, get another manager in who'll have the same problems and then will end up getting sacked because that's their only answer?\n\nNow they've got new people on the board it could be the change they needed and maybe if they run the club well ETH can do something\n\nWe know. Glazers out.\n\nFiring Ten Hag is not going to change United into a team that competes for title. They would still need to find a better coach, and there are not many good ones available now. The team they have can probably get somewhere around 5 or 6, but not higher. I don't think any other manager is going to squeeze more from these players. Building a better team will take several seasons. They got some young players who may or may not mature into world-class players - Garnacho, Mainoo, Hojlund. But this will take time.\n\nNot even a United fan but I'll say the problem is there's a culture built on making it a corporation and not a football club. Not enough is put into the sporting sector, much like many American owned football clubs. They have too many business guys in boards roles when they need better scouts, sporting director, manager, etc. They spend big on players without tactical knowledge on how it would work and it was their downfall. They shouldve leaned more into Mourinho to reshape the club. Much can be said with his other clubs shouldve done that too in Tottenham and Roma\n\nI bought a shirt (on sale) to support them lol, I‚Äôm not even from the UK and have never been a fan.\n\nThe club is truly falling apart for some time, the Dutch guy is just making the final dive into the mountain\n\nBig Sam?\n\nI think the Ten Hag project wont work. But i also think that its insane for United to try to solve it right now. \n\nIt needed to be done after last season or the second the manager you want is available. \n\nIf you pull the trigger now, you will get a 4th, 5th or 15th choice on the list, spend shit tons AGAIN to back him and we can repeat this thread in two years.\n\nBecause nothing will change. There is a structural problem at the club. They need to start over, make a real long term project, clean house and invest. But they cant Because they spend so much money already.\n\nI think its very difficult for them to attract the kind of manager they actually need. \n\nIm a Brentford fan so obviously dont want this to happen but let's say they went to Thomas Frank and offered him this clusterfuck.\n\nYou expect him to leave the club he obviously hold very dear in the middle of a season, and offering him what exactly? Ten Hags team, a toxic locker room and empty promises?\n\nI dont think thats very attractive to anybody who isnt just one of the old mercenary managers.\n\nHonestly baffled at how people blame each manager.\n\nOur style of football has remained the same with almost every manager. It's horrible and painful to watch. I genuinely wish players got the sack for bad results rather than the manager so it would give them a kick up the arse. \n\nThe club seems to ruin great players and managers it's not a coincidence, something is absolutely rotten with the club\n\nYes we are and need saving¬†\n\nThe circus act goes on and on üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ\n\nDown?\n\nUnited ultimately need a bit of an overhaul. Doesn't seem to matter who is there, or how talented they are, they seem to struggle.\n\nTo have a revolution requires the situation to get bad enough that drastic measures are taken, and exceptional individuals in the correct place at the correct time to take on such a change. \n\nEric is not that guy i don't think, but things aren't bad enough yet that the right people will rise to the surface.\n\nSouthgate in, long may the schadenfreude continue!\n\nSacking Ten Hag will not solve anything, it'll make people happy for a little but its not the solution. The club will continue to be bad even after his sacking. They need to completely restart from the bottom up which is pretty much impossible for them. I genuinely think they will continue to suffer for at least another decade before they start to improve.\n\nI as a passionate Napoli fan would personally like to thank Man Utd fans for McTominay! \n\nIncredible player! Thanks again!! Scored in 25 secs this morning!üòÜ\n\nIt takes time for a manager to get set\n\nI'm not sure again if changing manager would solve their problem.¬†\n\nAs both clubs have absolutely no clue what they are trying to develop I'd like to propose a cooperation between BvB and United to swap managers every 14 days. What could go wrong?\n\nWhen you become a PLC , the expectations are more from shareholders than from  fans. \nI hope they get relegated.\n\nTen Haag is not cut out to make it at this club.\n\nIf only anthony was still in his 2008 prime when he scored like 10 goals against Barcelona in the UCL final when being subbed in being down 2-0\n\nCheck INEOS out on Glassdoor and behold your future¬†"

It‚Äôs like they‚Äôve put this thing to VAR these guys are a joke lol\n\nWhen these things drag for so long it usually means that they're waiting for the attention to wave away\n\nAnd waiting for all their guys to get through their rehab programmes\n\nThis will take weeks or months to sort out.\n\nThen we will get a random note about it as soon as we have forgotten.\n\nProbably coote being fired but zero change to pgmol...I suspect this is a pgmol culture issue vs a coote issue.\n\n&gt;The ~~voting~~ football-loving public isn't interested in the act of corruption/incompetence/impropriety that some/one of our ~~MPs~~ referees committed a few weeks ago. They want us to move on and get back to ~~governing~~ refereeing ~~the country~~ matches.\n\nTo be blanked out where appropriate.\n\nAre you saying that VAR officials should be on cocaine to speed things up?\n\nThat's the only reason they call VAR checks... They're not looking at the screen, they're running to the cd case\n\nI think it's ridiculous that PGMOL prioritizes the speed of the VAR review over clear communication and getting the decision correct\n\nLiterally the moment VAR came in people were bitching about how long it takes to make a decision.\n\nLet‚Äôs not pretend they aren‚Äôt responding to public pressure.\n\nBefore VAR every highlights show was dominated by refereeing mistakes and calls for VAR.\n\nNow it‚Äôs all about why VAR is bad. \n\nThere‚Äôs an entire industry behind outrage at refs, no matter what they‚Äôre doing at any given time. \n\nYes, they‚Äôre shit. Always have been. But we‚Äôve allowed them to become a key focal point of the game and football discourse.\n\nVAR isn't bad. Halfwit officials are. They constantly underperform to a pathetic level. They're amateurs fucking around with a multibillion pound league. \n\nThey need to hire computer literate people who they train up on the granular rules of the game. Those people do the VAR. Then they need to train all the officials to communicate clearly, calmly, and quickly. The audio needs to be available in real-time to broadcasters and live audiences. Time to make the whole thing professional and transparent.\n\nThey should do it like in rugby, where they stop the time and the TMO (VAR equivalent) is projected to the stadium and the audio is broadcast to everyone\n\nIf you only watch football maybe you can waive it away but if you watch literally any other elite sport this shit would not be tolerated. \n  \nIt's a complete boys club. They simply protect one another no matter what happens and never take responsibility for how bad things have gotten. \n  \nVar has gotten better while the refs in general have gotten worse. \n  \nIt's both the frequency and severity of mistakes that us a problem and there's no accountability. They act as if drug testing is completely ridiculous meanwhile any important job in the world can have regular drug testing. What are they hiding??\n  \nGive them microphones. That will be a good first step. Fire Coote. Immedietely. Drug test them. Have some consequence for regular mistakes ffs.\n\nI‚Äôm convinced people who say this just don‚Äôt watch any other sport. I like quite a few other sports and in all of them people are always complaining about refs, and pretty often it‚Äôs about instant replay or why instant replay couldn‚Äôt look at a situation people think it should be able to look at. \n\nNo sport has perfect refereeing and no sport has a perfect instant replay mechanism. That goes double for contact sports where you get much more marginal decisions.\n\nAnyone who thinks other sports have perfect refs I‚Äôm convinced just doesn‚Äôt actually like other sports\n\nI'm talking about the Premier league not all of football. Other countries have better refereeing than us. The champions league non uk referees are mostly fine. And youre really going to talk about contact sports and ignore that rugby has a million times better refs than premier league. The players, staff, and spectators respect rugby refs, for the most part. While in the Premier league they are universally hated. \n  \nWhen you say people complain about refs in every sport that's obviously true but from the sports that I watch the refs never come across as a corrupt boys club like they do in the Premier league.\n\nEvery la liga fan I know hates all their refs, the World Cup final ref ruled out what was a legitimate goal by bayern in their semi final vs real. There are numerous decisions refs from each nation get wrong every week. If you mainly watch the PL of course you‚Äôll end up seeing more errors by PL refs but they also get big uefa games because they are good refs.\n\nIf you think rugby refereeing is uncontroverisal that‚Äôs just not true on the rugby sub Reddit people complain about the refs appointed for the games all the time. The referees changed the rules to rule out a try in the World Cup final, and got death threats as a result, the South African head coach got banned for abusing the ref after a game and people are constantly upset by TMO calls, the end of Scotland vs France in the six nations was roundly considered wrong and Glasgow fans were very unhappy with the ref after he ruled out a last minute try vs Exeter after using the TMO. Those are just some big game altering decisions but they get things wrong pretty often just like every referee. Everyone is also convinced that New Zealand get all the calls. The more into a sport you get the more you‚Äôll realise everyone thinks the refs aren‚Äôt good, other sports are just more accepting of it\n\nthey don't want to take action, that's why nothing is happening\n\nGives a whole new perspective to *\"we forgot to draw the lines\"*\n\nThey can't test them. They'll have no refs for the weekend if they do.\n\nWould be chaos and expose them all. :D\n\nI seriously suspect this is the actual reason.\n\nThis is the only reason. \n\nCocaine Screen is based on urine. You can‚Äôt even argue invasive needles for a blood test.\n\nLack of privacy while taking urine test is accepted for doping testing.\n\nWhat would drug testing actually achieve though? I personally couldn‚Äôt care less what they get up to in their free time.\n\nIt wouldn‚Äôt and tbh while I‚Äôm not defending this though it has to be said a shitton of people in the UK treat coke like it‚Äôs candy, I have to imagine a lot of people thinking there‚Äôs some epidemic problem with PL refs being druggies aren‚Äôt realising how big a problem this is nationwide.\n\nWho cares if a ref is on drugs though? Maybe some uppers would help them do better\n\n[deleted]\n\nTakes a lot of poor decisions to become a coke addict in the first place so after becoming one I imagine his rapid decision making skills aren't the best\n\n... and vice versa\n\nOr is it a cause?\n\nAn iq test would also be great.\n\nWait, they're denying drug testing for all PL refs? lmao... say no more.\n\nWe wouldn't have any refs otherwise\n\nGame would probably be better off with premier league teams playing playground rules and as gentlemen and saying oh sorry that was a foul..m yeah boss I was offside bring that play back... I reckon it would end up with more fucking correct decisions.\n\nSounds like rugby to me. And I‚Äôm not even from a Rugby country (though I have grown up with the sport).\n\nThere‚Äôs a saying in my country,  rugby‚Äôs a gentleman sport played by brutes. Or maybe better translated as; even though it‚Äôs a brutal the players behave like gentlemen.\n\nTell that to anyone whose eye has been gouged etc\n\nWhy would they drug test refs? What an absurd position.\n\nI'm sorry, but referees need to be at the height of mental acuity. And sniffing lines will fundamentally hinder that.\n\nI'm not against drugs, I just want the referees to be the best they can be at their job.\n\nDo they really need to be at the height of mental acuity to see if something is a foul, offside or not? There‚Äôs blokes on ten pints and a bag of sniff in the crowd that can see an offside better than a sober Lino at times.\n\nThis isn‚Äôt complex surgery it‚Äôs watching a football match ffs.\n\nI think somewhere in between is a fair shout.\n\nTargeted drug tests if there seems to be a clear issue with doing your job.\n\nI wouldn't care if a ref is taking gear if they're generally a solid referee.\n\nThis is SUCH a weird take. Would you be against the judge in a legal case you‚Äôre involved in being on gear, if that judge is generally a solid judge?\n\nFfs this is their job, they‚Äôre paid a shit ton of money too, what are you even talking about mate.\n\nI‚Äôd expect a judge not to be on the gear if they‚Äôre responsible for sending down people for possession of drugs, but I don‚Äôt really think it makes a difference if he has a couple of lines with a pint at the weekend to his ability to do the job. Although I feel he has a moral duty to comply with the law he‚Äôs employed to uphold. I don‚Äôt believe a referee owes us that moral duty, as long as it doesn‚Äôt affect their performance why should I care if they‚Äôre sniffing lines and saying they hate jurgen Klopp.\n\nI just don't believe in mandatory drug testing for jobs unless it endangers someone's life. Pretty straight forward.\n\nThere's a difference between someone being found to be on the gear and getting sacked, and bringing in expensive regular drug testing. The likelihood is, great referees have been on the gear in the past and have still been good at their job. I'm not arguing against sacking someone for misconduct, I'm arguing against the ridiculous levels we put employees through with drug testing in jobs where harm is not an issue. \n\nWhere do we stop the buck with the drug testing? At what level is acceptable? I've studied anti doping for years and targeted testing is very effective.\n\nThat‚Äôs not what you said mate.\n\n**I wouldn‚Äôt care if a ref is taking gear if they‚Äôre generally a solid referee.**\n\nThink about that for a second.\n\nThere‚Äôs accusations of drug abuse. Refs have a responsibility, they have authority. It‚Äôs a billion dollar industry.\n\n It‚Äôs not even a mandatory test either. There‚Äôs no reason for referees to OPPOSE a cocaine test mate. They‚Äôre paid over a hundred grand to ref a couple games a month, wake up brother.\n\nGenuinely confused why you‚Äôre fighting on this hill. For the sake of the sport or even just in general. We‚Äôre not talking about mandatory tests here, we‚Äôre talking about deleting the controversy from the sport we all love.\n\nJesus, they're football referees not pilots. Its not that important. If refs are showing up to work hungover to fuck, sure, that's a problem with their professionalism and there's a conversation to be had. But drug testing them is absolutely absurd. People need to get a life, its actually so embarrassing to take football this seriously.\n\nIt's ok, it's not like there's any major money involved in football, or that players and staff dedicate their lives too it... ah well, good thing they don't take it seriously, ey?\n\nSo what? It's still just a game\n\n\"Why bother working hard bro, it's just a job\"\n\nYou can't even fathom that drugs have long and short term affects on your body and brain, which could affect your ability to judge. I'm not going to waste my time explaining the difference between; \"football\" as a game, and \"football\" as an elite level sport. \n\nIf you can't work it out yourself, we're done here.\n\nBecause doing a line once a a month means you're not working hard?\n\nNo, but every weekend, yes.\n\nThey work every weekend they would have to snort midweek when there is no cup games lol\n\nYou seem very upset about something that shouldn‚Äôt be taken seriously‚Ä¶\n\nI just think it's ridiculous that people want to control referees lives so much over fucking football.\n\nPoor things for only ¬£150,000 a year they‚Äôre expected to be sober on the job now\n\nFound Coote‚Äôs alt. \n\nAlso, people probably wouldn‚Äôt give a shit if the refs were actually doing their jobs well. Some of the decisions this year make a lot more sense if made under the influence of drugs lol\n\non one hand it‚Äôs just a game for entertainment. there is not that much of a difference between a referee of a  professional game and a casual one.\n\n\non the other hand PL is a multi billion dollar thing. you would expect some professionalism to keep it controversy free\n\n[removed]\n\nOpioids are detectable anywhere from 3-14 days. Cocaine also 3+ days.\nAnd I don‚Äôt care if they snort lines every Wednesday as long as they‚Äôre sober on match day.\n\nIf a ref is doing a good job then who cares what drugs they're on?\n\nUnless Pierluigi Collina comes out and admits he's a massive baghead, I'm not in favour of referees compromising their mental acuity, simply for integrity sake. Whether they're good or bad, plays no part.\n\nWell the way his eyes pop out it wouldn‚Äôt surprise meüòÇ\n\nDrugs can affect your judgement.\n\nEdit word\n\nSo are we gona stop them drinking and smoking now?\n\nThose are legal, can't stop anyone doing legal things.\n\nMany countries' aviation authority forbid alcohol intake by pilots within a few hours of their flights, despite it being legal to consume alcohol in those countries.\n\nI'm by no means equating the two professions and what's at stake, but a ban on legal substances for refs which affect judgement while they're working isn't unreasonable.\n\nI'd be very surprised if this wasn't already in place. Every employer I've had with the exception of one (a bar) had no drinking before or during your shift written in our contracts\n\nIt's a good idea. I don't care what a ref puts into his body as long as it isn't a problem, but being a habitual user is not good when your judgement is the most important thing to these games.\n\nSo only illegal things impact your judgement?\n\nYour point was that drugs affect your judgement. Drinking and smoking don't magically stop being drugs because they're legal.\n\nThey're not testing for those, so it's entirely irrelevant, nor is cocaine on the level of nicotine or caffeine. Further, if you turn up to work as a ref drunk, you should be sacked, but it would be infringing your rights to test for alcohol as it is not illegal. It's a bad argument.\n\nThe guys drug use is entirely irrelevant, what's relevant is his outburst about Liverpool/Klopp/Germans which has ruined his credibility as a supposedly unbiased referee. If the guy turned up inebriated then by all means his job should also be I'm question, but the fact that this conversation has deviated from the initial video outburst to drug testing refs is ridiculous. Its focusing on the wrong issue. \n\nA good few of these refs go to the UAE and Saudi Arabia to ref games days before prem games. I've heard less chatter about that which is a joke given it totally contravenes their credibility, taking money from people who literally own teams they ref against in England.\n\nI agree. Drug testing refs is pointless unless we have some reason to think it‚Äôs so rampant that refs are high during matches. Solution without a problem.\n\nJust fire the man and move on.\n\nThe only impact drug testing will have is making the position less desirable than it already is and there‚Äôs enough difficult finding quality officials as it is.\n\nOn match day? Yes. Referees should not show up to the match drunk or smoking anything that seriously impairs their ability to function mentally (tobacco doesn‚Äôt do that acutely)\n\nAlright David calm down\n\nI wouldn't want to be a ref anyway but you could add unnecessary drug testing to the list of reasons why.\n\nI like how they're changing the direction of the news to \"white powder\" controversy rather than honing in on the actual problem that the referee's are horrendously biased, consistently make poor decisions and skew their decisions to favour their own agendas.\n\nThis is just a protect our own mentality that they've inherited from the Metropolitan police, at some point they'll feel sorry for Coote and use \"white powder\" as a way to say he's got a problem similar to the gambling bs they were peddling a while ago.\n\nYeah as soon as the coke allegations came out I thought \"well there goes the conversation on ref bias\"\n\nThey'll dismiss him on ground of drugs if anything now, even though \"German cunt\" should have been enough to make his position untenable in the first place.\n\nI agree he showed xenophobia and drug use and I think his position is untenable. But I don't think I've seen evidence of bias.\n\nHating Klopp because he felt Klopp had been unfair to him is completely understandable. Referees are humans, if you're a dick to them they'll hate you. Doesn't necessarily mean they will make bias decisions. If you don't know that, you've probably never refereed any serious sport, ever. \n\nIn fact Coote even explained mitigations against bias in this coke fueled rant.\n\nKlopp/Liverpool comments aside - you don't think prejudice can play into bias?\n\nRefs are meant to be paragons of impartiality. That's not a bar I've set, that's the PGMOL's. We know they're human and we know they have these conversations in private, but when you are looking square down the camera and calling a manager in your league a \"German cunt\" you've made it impossible for football at large to look at you seriously in your job as a ref any longer.\n\nI'm only giving the kind of scrutiny to Coote that the PGMOL *should*. They defend their integrity pretty harshly anytime a player or manager alleges untoward behaviour by an official on the pitch, they should take it just as seriously the other way then when one of their own chats shit down the camera about clubs, managers, and nationalities in the league he works in as an authority. \n\nThat's not even taking into account his seeming drug habit, which compromises his position even further in many ways, and probably why this investigation is dragging out so much.\n\nThe best move for PGMOL's image is to bin Coote as soon as possible. And bring in drugs tests while they're at it. Insane that it's not already something they do.\n\nIf that was anyone else in just about any other job, he is bringing the company into disrepute \n\nYou post a video saying a co worker is a cunt, pissed, pupils alluding to an alleged stimulant, waving a phone with a photo of yourself. In your company uniform, on site. Mentioning the name of another member of staff, in uniform, who also has no idea about the unbelievable amount of gross misconduct being recorded, posted to social media, and setting fire to the Internet \n\nHR are going to peg you\n\nI'm talking about bias among referees in general, not just Coote, if you're a dick to a referee the referee should be able to look past it and carry on doing his job as a professional, the fact he cannot suggest he's crooked. He's paid to do a difficult job I understand but he's paid to do it whilst maintaining his roles ethics.\n\nThe old \"if you've never done it then you don't have an opinion\" argument is garbage, when we see something wrong we comment on it, this is fact for all walks of life.\n\nHave you looked at the 6/7 blatant cheating decisions against Liverpool from Coote? A couple of which altered the course of the title? And a couple that the PGMOL admitted were incorrect? No signs of bias??? Are you living in a cave?\n\nI think the bias thing is slightly complicated here by the fact that it‚Äôs a bias that built up during Coote‚Äôs career rather than one he started with.\n\nObviously he should be punished/fired but I‚Äôm not sure how you make rules for a ref growing to hate a manager unless they get caught like this.\n\nEspecially when so many managers spend so many games screaming at refs, it‚Äôs something that‚Äôs going to happen. If I got yelled at by someone at work all the time I wouldn‚Äôt like them much either.\n\nAt work we all have opinions of people but we don‚Äôt need to share them knowing we‚Äôre on video that is really dumb.  In private is fine but you don‚Äôt knowingly leave that type of evidence\n\nSure and that (among other things) is why he should be punished. My point was more that there‚Äôs no real way to prevent those sort of opinions developing in the future.\n\nEven if officials come into the game with no bias it‚Äôs going to develop over time, especially with how players and managers react to decisions.\n\nI have officiated high level soccer matches myself.  It‚Äôs human nature and it‚Äôs somewhat impossible to rectify.  That being said while there‚Äôs coaches I don‚Äôt love at the end of the day we‚Äôre both stuck with each other and as professionals we try and get through our days without a sending off which is a headache for both of us.  I‚Äôm also a coach as well I know how to interact with referees if coaches are pissing off the referees and calls are going against them that‚Äôs poor coaching.\n\nüòÇüòÇ FA and POGML is so corrupt.\n\nPersonally don‚Äôt give a fuck about them using drugs more them being biased, this drug testing is clearly a red herring from the press.\n\nYou should. This is a pretty easy way to blackmail referees. A referee should be completely aware. Now cocaine joke blah blah blah but a bender is a bender. And mental faculties need to be as close to 100% as possible. This is a disgrace\n\nThis. Ref's can be compromised. What if they were doing drugs with the players he had to officiate over the next day? This is bad. The rot has reached the core.\n\nWhy would they be doing drugs with players? I very much doubt the refs and the players move in the same social circles\n\nIt‚Äôs football refereeing not MI6, I can‚Äôt imagine the risk of blackmail being that likely at all.\n\nThe white powder controversy is nothing though. The man isn't an athlete. What he puts in his body is none of our business. \n\nIt's completely an integrity issue with having a referee with a clear public bias against a specific team.\n\nPoor take. Refs should 100% be drug tested. They are involved in the game as much as the players and if they are inebriated from drugs during games  or even from the night before this will obviously affect their decision making in game.\n\nTo this point Referees need to pass fitness tests regularly, so quite clearly their fitness and related drug use is important to the role (and therefore should be drug tested)\n\n[deleted]\n\nDepends on the drug right? A undefined white drug could be argued to impair judgement and so on\n\nAgree it doesn't matter in regards to sporting advantage but I know for sure my employment is at risk of i take illegal drugs\n\nWell... no. If they pass the fitness test they are fit enough regardless of their drug use.\n\nI had the same view as above until you just said this. And Google tells me that cocaine results in reduced brain function and ability to make complex decisions. I guess I was wrong.\n\nI always just thought of drug use being banned because it makes you better (which is the case for the athletes). Never considered it the other way around.\n\nDrug use has nothing to do with why Coote‚Äôs can‚Äôt work anymore it‚Äôs that he‚Äôs created a reasonable apprehension of bias. This is a solution without a problem and will only turn people away because people don‚Äôt like their privacy being violated without good cause. \n\nDo we have some reason to think refs aren‚Äôt sober enough to work or that this has any connection to issues in the quality of refereeing? We don‚Äôt.\n\nYeah but it only really matters if they were doing drugs the night before a game.\n\nOther than being a really easy target for blackmail.\n\nYeah but plenty of reasons to get blackmailed which aren't criminal; sexuality, infidelity, having bad fuckin opinions. Id certainly kick up a fuss if they started drug testing primarily to protect refs from blackmail.\n\nExcept if you were being blackmailed for something that wasn't criminal you'd be quite likely to go to the police. Especially if your job relies on you having integrity. If you have to admit you're buying Class A's to the police it'll be a lot more difficult.\n\nWith the amount of money that can be made from spot bets I'd be amazed if it wasn't being done already somewhere.\n\nWell that's just it. Take the blackmail out of the picture and there's still the 'loads of money to be made' aspect which I suspect is probably more prevalent.\n\nSo in your workplace if they found drugs in your system but it wasn‚Äôt the night before they would just let you off? Yeah don‚Äôt think so bud.\n\nMy workplace wouldn‚Äôt drug test me if they didn‚Äôt think I was high\n\nI see the principle of their point though. No workplace would accept it, but that doesn‚Äôt mean your performance is necessarily impaired\n\nI'm talking from a practicality standpoint and how it affects his ability to do his job. Societal attitudes towards personal liberties isn't really my focus here.\n\nI would leave my workplace if they felt so little trust that they needed to randomly violate my privacy over faux concerns.\n\nHow is this even relevant?\n\nBy that standard should we be alcohol testing them too? Both seem a bit overkill imo\n\nKarens always get mad when you remind them alcohol is a drug lol\n\nYeah, why not? If a video came out of some refs doing tequila shots before a match, I think that would be extremely reasonable.\n\nThey are reffing a game of football, how important is that really? Shouldn't we be drug testing doctors, nurses, and air traffic controllers before we test refs?  They literally have lives in their hands.\n\nMany of those people DO get drug tested, at least where I live. But to answer your question, if videos came out that surgeons were doing drugs before an operation, then yes it would be reasonable to test them.\n\nIf a ref is doing their job well, who fucking cares if they're on drugs or not?¬†\n\nNot to mention the fact that drugs are, in fact, illegal, and the fact that a ref could easily be blackmailed as a result.\n\nYeah, because you'd really want Michael Oliver on a comedown officiating your clubs games, right?\n\nMost, if not all jobs, will fire you for \"white powder\". Athlete or not.\n\nOnly if you bring it to work, which he didn't\n\nwell, apparently he did use it while at the EUROs\n\nDude what. Imagine this: If a cop gives me a speeding ticket or a fine despite me literally not doing anything wrong and it turns out that he‚Äôs been taking speedballs and cocaine then of course it would matter\n\nThe bias is a separate issue entirely he doesn‚Äôt need cocaine to be biased\n\nI do agree the public bias against a team aspect is overshadowed. Maybe the drugs video was purposely leaked in order to cover up, and frame Mr. Coote as someone who needs help and support rather than a biased arrogant ref using xenophobic language.\n\nThe timing of these leaked videos is suspect. He may have been blackmailed or involved in illegal activities, and the PL just want this to go away.\n\nA drug problem or a gambling problem ‚Ä¶ those compromise officials. ‚ÄúIf you do a thing for me ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll make sure you get a gram next international break ‚Ä¶.‚Äù Coote only makes 100k, not much for that Bolivian Marching powder.\n\nWhy hasn't anyone else made this point?!\nFootball is a target for match fixers as there is so much money on the line (betting or promotion etc). If someone has incriminating evidence of you, like say I dunno a gang who may have both drug and gambling connections, they've got you by the balls.\n\nMaking up a situation here but let's say you have a ref who does cocaine, a gang finds out and hey presto you can now manipulate the number of free kicks and if you don't play ball they leak incriminating evidence of that.\n\nWhen there is so much money to gain by others there will.be a targeted effort to get leverage. Drug testing may well protect refs!\n\nThe danger with jobs like refereeing is that you are high risk for attempts at blackmail or bribery. \n\nOnce they have obvious blackmail material, like videos of you snorting lines with them, then it becomes a lot more likely. \n\nIt's like the rules about betting, it's risk mitigation.  \n\nOrdinarily I'd agree, I don't care what people put in their bodies and I think prohibition has failed. \n\nBut right now, cocaine is a class A drug in the UK that carries prison terms. Using it and being reckless enough to video it multiple times makes you a much bigger risk for blackmail etc.\n\nSorry but using illicit drugs is .. well .. illegal. Smh\n\n[deleted]\n\nIf he was caught under the influence he would be cautioned\n\n[deleted]\n\nDrugs penalties\nYou can get a fine or prison sentence if you:\n\ntake drugs,\ncarry drugs,\nmake drugs,\nsell, deal or share drugs (also called ‚Äòsupplying‚Äô them)\nThe penalties depend on the type or ‚Äòclass‚Äô of drug or substance, the amount you have, and whether you‚Äôre also dealing or producing it.\n\n\nSource: gov website. So I'm not wrong\n\n Edit: Dude blocked me lmao it's right at the top of the gov UK website. The first thing listed for a fine or prison, is taking drugs.\n\n[deleted]\n\nIf he's caught taking drugs he absolutely would. That's the possession charge right there. Being caught already under the influence is not however.\n\nSo you really want us to have coke fiend referees?\n\nIf they do a good job is there a problem?\n\nFootball is watched by impressionable young people. I recognise that refs aren't idolised like players, but being OK with authority figures taking drugs in a sport watched by millions of children doesn't send a good message. \n\nHe should be sacked for the same reasons Richard Bacon was sacked from Blue Peter, irrespective of any effect drugs might have on his physical/mental ability to do his job.\n\nAdd the issue of his biases being made public, his position is absolutely untenable.\n\nI‚Äôm not a fan of drug testing for non performance enhancing drugs. What someone does in their private life is up to them, and it‚Äôs usually only warranted in roles where your competency poses a life and death risk to your colleagues/customers(i.e people operating heavy machinery, surgeons and roles like that). Also a lot of these tests catch things that can stay in your blood for a long time, even if when they took the substance ages ago.\n\nThe standard of refereeing in general is horrendous. Addressing poor performance is higher priority than drug testing refs only for them to still go out and ref a game as if they were high off their tits. And addressing performance will weed out those who are not fit to ref anyway.\n\nThey should be taking drugs. Fill every referee full of EPO and Adderall. They'd be super fit and super focused. It'd improve the standard of referring\n\nMaybe some of the epl referees are taking drugs . Im not surprised\n\nDavid Coote‚Äôs had his bacon saved here, he was about to put a transfer request to Columbia in\n\nJust so we're clear, that fucking last line of 'white powder' can't go anywhere.\n\nYou know they‚Äôre unfit to investigate themselves when they refuse to ask questions they won‚Äôt like the answers to.\n\nOne thing is for sure, he will never be rated top-tier ref again\n\nUnbelievable Jeff!!!\n\nIf there is a suspicion that elite refs are using recreational drugs, there is no reason not to do random checks on match days. Just inform them they‚Äôve been picked on arrival, and have the testers present for when it works for the referee. Use the same testers as the footballers.¬†\n\nThe only argument against, that I can see, is that referees have no reason to take performance enhancing drugs, but that‚Äôs not the question at hand. If you want this 100k a year job, be squeaky clean and be shown to be squeaky clean.¬†\n\nA big part of why football referees are so despised compared to other sports is the lack of transparency and accountability. If you want to combat that, you introduce as much transparency and accountability as possible.¬†\n\nVAR is a step toward that, and it is an issue precisely cos these preening peacocks see it as a threat to their ‚Äúauthority‚Äù, rather than a tool to reach the right decisions more often.¬†\n\nBut players are tested, why not refs?\n\nDrug tests should be obligatory.   Drug addiction opens refs up to blackmail risk among other things so it‚Äôs extra important for the role\n\nSmells fishy that they‚Äôre not committing to testing or at least saying they‚Äôll bring it in on X date to allow them time to implement it\n\nI can‚Äôt wait to see what chants the fans in the stadiums come up with. PGMOL are so sanctimonious they deserve a massive dose of shit back at them.\n\nThis is crazy lol\n\nhmmm\n\nWho gives a fuck how high the refs are. Couldnt possibly make their decisions any worse.\n\nFor 6 months so that all drugs can be cleared off their system\n\nNot sure it matters really. Referees aren't competing. Maybe the cocaine will make them more alert even.\n\nBecause they kbow they'd all be gone\n\nFeel like there is some conspiracy here, what's the chances that all of this just happened to come out during the international break\n\nNot exactly what's being discussed here, and I may be in the minority, but does anyone else think that refs should be encouraged to use performance enhancing drugs?\n\nYes and I'm surprised the majority of people here are against it. Bunch of boring conservative fans I guess\n\nHalf the crowd of your average match is on coke.\n\nThat‚Äôs just not true, stop projecting\n\nHere's a link to an academic study backing up my point\n\nhttps://www.stir.ac.uk/news/2023/june-2023-news/research-finds-extensive-drug-culture-in-football/\n\nBtw I'm not a cocaine user.\n\nIt doesn‚Äôt say half the crowd is on cocaine.\n\nI didn't mean literally \"half\" FFS just that drug use was rife in the terraces and in society.\n\nStill, I should know better than posting in one of the more toxic subs here.\n\nLeave the man alone, if he wants to sniff lives then let him\n\ni think its more that he was likely sniffing all throughout working in the euros.\n\ni couldnt care less if people wanna do a bit of drugs, but its unprofessional during and around work and will effect your ability to adequately carry out your job, especially one that requires someone to be athletic and cognitive\n\nAt least it made the euros more interesting. I want refs on the pitch on gear, linesmen on Ket and VAR officials on Angel dust. Fuk it.\n\nGet em all on drugs. Players on coke at peak performance\n\nEven the managers?\n\nManagers on ghb. Have them slurring poor instructions throughout and eventually pass out pitch side leaving the players in a free for all\n\nWith one fan that's on Spice, allowed to run on the pitch, just once to help the team out\n\nIt's tricky cos one ref soung drugs doesn't mean all are but st the same time it could be good to just make sure\n\nI imagine it'll eventually come in, maybe in time for next season, gives the referees plenty of time to get whatever's in their system out and a chance to get clean. Think we'll be seeing a few resignations next summer!\n\nWhy is it ruled out???\n\nThis spells guilty to me. How many refs are doing blow then making horrible mistakes on the pitch.\n\nAre drug tests not mandatory for referees like it it is for players?\n\nAre drug tests not mandatory for referees like it it is for players?\n\nAs I‚Äôve always known, PGMOL is a CARTEL! A deeply CORRUPT CARTEL!"

    "all_comment_text": "Could someone summarise or copy and paste bc of the paywall?\n\nEngland risk ban from their own Euros, Uefa warns\nOfficials have told ministers that Labour plans for a state-run football watchdog put the independence of the sport in jeopardy\n\nHarry Kane, Phil Foden and Bukayo Saka could miss out on the next Euros because of what would be perceived as ‚Äúgovernment interference‚Äù if a football regulator is introduced.\n\nEngland could be banned from the first Euros it has hosted in a generation if Sir Keir Starmer moves ahead with existing plans for a men‚Äôs football regulator, Uefa has warned ministers.\n\nTheodore Theodoridis, general secretary of Uefa, the governing body, wrote to Lisa Nandy, the culture secretary, this month saying that there should be ‚Äúno government interference in the running of football‚Äù.\n\nAccording to a leaked copy of the letter, Theodoridis cautioned against plans outlined in the King‚Äôs Speech to give the new regulator broad powers to oversee clubs in England‚Äôs top five leagues. He said the game‚Äôs independence was a ‚Äúfundamental requirement‚Äù.\n\nThe last government tabled the legislation for a new watchdog in March to stop wealthy clubs joining breakaway leagues. \n\nI suspect there‚Äôs more but all I could read by turning off javascript.\n\nSo is this Abu Dhabi flexing its power over English regulators by influencing Uefa to use the Euros as leverage? Timing is suspicious and makes it seem likely.\n\nVery interesting timing that this regulator has been proposed for a while now, yet the new Labour government is fairly new, and more interestingly, the date for Man City‚Äôs hearing is now set. \n\nI mean, I‚Äôve never thought for a second Man City will face any punishment. But this confirms it.\n\nThat's a large stretch. State interference = automatic ban has been FIFA and UEFA's stance for decades and the British Government formally made it government policy by putting it in the King's Speech. UEFA responding with a warning would be the standard practice.\n\nSo, UAE and the Saudis are permanently banned then?\n\nNo bc it‚Äôs gonna be like pl: Everton gets point deduction\n\nCompromise, all Everton players are banned from the Euros\n\nYes they own multiple clubs. How is that not state interference?\n\nThey ostensibly don‚Äôt interfere in the running of their FA.  I mean they probably do, but you‚Äôll likely never tie the decisions to anyone in govt.  I mean most of the FAs in Africa for example rely on govt as well as fifa funding, however they only get into trouble when the govt interference is overt.\n\nTo be fair that might be how it used to be, but these days most tinpot dictators are putting massive amounts into football. Obviously the Oligarchs have been doing it for ages, China put billions into the CSL until it went bust, Saudi are having their big moment now whilst Erdogan has full power over the Turkish FA and Orban with the Hungary FA. \n\nThis isn‚Äôt about government interference in football, this is UEFA acting out of desperation before MI5 and Interpol is at their HQ\n\nTo be fair, however much power QSI with its control over PSG I do find it a bit hard to believe they have a lot of influence over the French FA, for example, and what they do is probably tied to their role as majority share-holders of PSG.\n\nThey are responsible to UEFA. They don't regulate things.\n\nHonestly they probably are permanently banned from UEFA\n\nThen so should the clubs they own\n\nNo bc money\n\nI‚Äôm not clear how an independent football regulator would be seen as government intervention. They‚Äôd be independent from government üòÇ\n\nThis is the crux of it. The government are just re-assessing the parameters of which football can operate in. It‚Äôs like the 3pm blackout or no alcohol in the stands and shit like that. They‚Äôll just be putting into law things that regulate club ownership, financial rules and maybe some players‚Äô rights. No different to Germany‚Äôs 50+1.\n\n&gt;No different to Germany‚Äôs 50+1.\n\nHow is that similar to 50+1? 50+1 is not in any way a law. It's a regulation by the DFL (hence decided by the clubs in the top 2 leagues). The government has nothing to do with it.\n\nThen from where do they get their authority?\n\nThem being set up by the government doesn't make them a government interfering body.\n\nI am struggling to think of more corrupt organisations than UEFA and FIFA. Maybe only the Olympic committee and boxing. How are Arab states buying clubs not state interference?\n\nBuying a football club as a state is what exactly? No state interference?\n\nSo when are we banning all middle eastern clubs, psg and City? :)\n\nYeah we should just threaten to ban city and Newcastle from the football league and see if they back down\n\nRight.. but to wait  9 months? It‚Äôs been on the table for a few years also, plenty of time for them to comment/issue a warning.\n\nIf they created an independent regulator for football from all the UK countries this would solve the issue\n\nNice conspiracy theory\n\nThe government surely shouldn't regulate a billion ¬£ industry with huge potential to serve as a capital store for international bad actors as well as devastating cultural institutions through poor management. They should instead look to great examples like Saudi Arabia where all clubs are de facto owned by the state - that's absolutely fine.\n\n&gt;Theodore Theodoridis\n\nLol\n\nMy Greek bro has 2 first names\n\nNeville Neville\n\nJon Jones\n\nI think it's very suspect that an organization, which has overarching ties to corruption, is railing against the idea of a bit of oversight.\n\nShould be a massive red flag as to what UEFA et al have been getting away with up to now.\n\nWould be fun if England implemented this half a year before the Euro's and said \"it's either OK, or you go find someone else to host.\"\n\nI imagine France or Germany could host it even on relatively short notice. However I also think England should just do it, because this is nonsense and UEFA kicking out one of the major nations would surely be the end of UEFA.\n\nSimple solution: Tell them to pound sand and still host it with England still in it, and declare UEFA a terrorist organization. After everyone in UEFA is either arrested or assassinated by the SAS, we just have the normal Euros, just ran by the UK.\n\nü´®\n\nTIL \"Independence\" of a sport is when FIFA controls everything lol\n\nThey de facto hosted the 2021 Euros.\n\nOh so it's a bunch of neoliberal bullcrap and England haven't actually done anything bad.\n\nHold up. We‚Äôre hosting the next euros?\n\nDidn‚Äôt we host the one before last?\n\nOfficially nobody did, but because of covid regulations in some of the other countries England ended up with more fixtures than planned.\n\nWell, I‚Äôm surprised we‚Äôre doing 2028 given we managed to turn Wembley into a war zone for the final.\n\nAll I see is more motiavtion to do it.\n\nUEFA cucks the players, with just loading more gamea upon them.\nMore games in ChL, Nations League, Euros.\n\nDont worry in a few years, we'll see all countries advance from the Euros into the 1/32 finals smh.\n\nFirst time I‚Äôve heard about this but this government really can‚Äôt help itself with overreaching its powers, can it?\n\nA football watchog has been discussed since back when BoJo was in power, so no, you can't pin this on the month old government. Nice try though.\n\nI don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs labour or conservative doing it, government overreach is a problem in this country regardless of the party performing it, nor is the new government beholden to what prior ones did. If it‚Äôs choosing to follow the mistakes of the Tories, they‚Äôre just as suspect.\n\nSo you'd rather let the PL become a sportswashing hub, with whatever autocratic petrostate investing the most money winning?\n\nWhich of the multitude of problems the UK currently faces are due to \"government overreach\"?\n\nHes just a right wing whos brain has become mush from listening to American talking points\n\nIt‚Äôs literally a response in favour of fans following the huge super league protests. A Govt acting for the people against outside interests sounds exactly like what a Govt should be doing.\n\nDo you have an actual argument as to the problem with government regulation being introduced into football beyond some general libertarian-type ideological claim here?\n\nOh learn some critical thinking and form an opinion for yourself for once\n\nThey are the new Tories, what did you expect?\n\nThis is one of the few thing I don't have an issue with, as long as independent actually means independent.\n\n[There you go, mate](https://12ft.io/https://www.thetimes.com/uk/society/article/england-risks-ban-from-their-own-euros-uefa-warns-cldk9nw0p#Echobox=1726339173)\n\nCheers\n\nYou could use the 12 feet ladder site to read it.\n\nI think that‚Äôs stopped working hasn‚Äôt it?\n\nNah, someone used (maybe a mirror site) on this article.\n\nIt's selective,some sites it doesn't work on or has agreed not to do it on\n\nOh, I‚Äôll have to give it another try. I thought the whole thing has been shut down because they were sued\n\nLike z-libary. Enjoy it while it lasts\n\nCheers never heard of it\n\nIf you bookmark [this](http://archive.today/) site, it's very useful, you copy the link of the paywalled article post it where it says:\n\n\"My url is alive and I want to archive its content\"\n\nThen you can view it\n\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20240914213509/https://www.thetimes.com/uk/society/article/england-risks-ban-from-their-own-euros-uefa-warns-cldk9nw0p#Ec\n\nNah\n\nNo bother if u don‚Äôt wanna, next time don‚Äôt need to waste ur time commenting\n\nWell I don't see it as a waste of time, you asked a question, and to be polite I answered it\n\nBut just to expand on it, I don't think it's fair for me to buy the subscription and share the content for free\n\nTaking a euro from a billionaire, it won‚Äôt make him become poorüòÇ, I doubt anyone really pays it in anyways as there‚Äôs some sites to get around the paywall\n\n&gt;Well I don't see it as a waste of time, you asked a question, and to be polite I answered it\n\nYour answer wasn't correct though, as not only could somebody do it, they in fact did do it.\n\nSo perhaps this can be a learning experience for you, you're likely not best placed to be able to answer for everybody in the subreddit.\n\nI was speaking for myself jackass\n\nThen that sounds like a *massive* waste of time.\n\nCool, but it's a Saturday and I have a lot of time to spare, not that it's your business anyway üëç\n\n&gt;Cool, but it's a Saturday and I have a lot of time to spare, not that it's your business anyway üëç\n\nIt was you who said you don't think it's a waste of time, so the fact that you have time you're willing to waste isn't particularly relevant.\n\nBut you're also implying that every single person who may see this post should write a response to the top level comment stating their own ability or willingness to share the articles content.\n\nYou might have all the free time in the world, but even just 30 seconds from even just a few thousand of commenters will quickly add up to a lot of wasted time.\n\n&gt; But you're also implying that every single person who may see this post should write a response to the top level comment stating their own ability or willingness to share the articles content.\n\nIf they are paying a The Times subscription, like myself, yes they should. I was the only one polite enough to do it.\n\n\"We have specific rules that guard against [state meddling]\" said the organisation who suspended their top chief over links to breaking rules that guard against state meddling .\n\nThe whole Balkans and Turkey AFAIK are openly interfering in their local football leagues. This is ridiculous.\n\nState meddling? It‚Äôs a game, not an election\n\nIt‚Äôs a business, businesses get regulated by governments to protect their interests. \n\nShocking\n\nState meddling? It‚Äôs a game, not an election\n\nLol.\n\nSo an independent regulator set up to protect clubs from irresponsible owners is too much interfering.\n\nBut governments owning clubs is perfectly fine.\n\nFuck off.\n\nIt won't happen because UEFA like money.\n\nUEFA is definitely very greedy. I haven't seen any body that's as greedy as they are.¬†\n\n*\"Theodoridis also pointed to a proposed licensing system for clubs ‚Äì a first ‚Äì as being problematic, arguing it could encourage other countries to set up their own regulators. This, Uefa believes, would dilute its power and make the sport ungovernable.\"*\n\nSeems the most important part imo - its just another multinational corporation determined to have more power than elected governments. Fuck ‚Äòem\n\nAs usual the headline is the most catchy version of this though, lets be honest they wouldn‚Äôt kick one of their biggest members out for anything less than a war (and even then, they didn‚Äôt kick out Russia in 2014) and banning PL clubs from CL would just give the proposed super league more juice\n\nYeah funny they're going to ban England rather than pl clubs isn't it\n\nTechnically both should be banned if they're being fair, but banning city etc would hurt their masters, sorry investors so they won't do it\n\nWould also lead to a Premier league style CL replacement which would kill them (and benefit the sport)\n\nObviously super league is shit but the regulator would block that too so we'd end up with better reform like a less corrupt cl\n\nWhen they say \"ungovernable\" they mean less corruptable. They think that state intervention is going to uncover something  or hit them in the pocket. Probably both.\n\nWhen they are allowing Milan to sell Champions League group/league stage tickets for 160‚Ç¨ I'd say regulation can't come quickly enough.\n\nIt does feel like we have reached the point of saturation.\n\nEmpty threat. England could just wait until the day before the tournament and then pull government security support and cancel the tournament.\n\nHow is it an empty threat? The UK successfully bid to host the Euros and won. They entered into contractual agreements and cannot back down without breaching these contracts.\n\nIt's an empty threat because there's no way they're going to ban England for this\n\nWhat is UEFA going to do? There is nothing in the contract that would be breached if the tournament is cancelled over security reasons.\n\nBan England from every international tournament for the next 50 years \n\nOr stop other leagues from selling or buying from English leagues\n\nThey already said they‚Äôd do that. Nobody would take UEFA seriously, other world governments aren‚Äôt going to look upon UEFA trying to shut down regulation of the sport lightly, especially the EU.\n\nMany nations club teams are already looking to leave UEFA and form a super league without them, it was really the revolt in England that killed it. The Spanish teams are on board, with English PL teams and now support from UK govt to form their own league UEFA would be at serious risk of losing huge amounts of funding going forward.\n\nWith Spain, England and Italian teams on their own league the CL and UEFA club format would be dead in the water.\n\nUEFA are not as powerful as they think, they need the allies. They almost lost everything not that long ago.\n\nAlso, banning England would just prompt people to choose to form a new league at the club or nation level. \n\nEngland‚Äôs second league is on par with most other first leagues in Europe in terms of revenue, and the EPL is almost as big as the next two largest leagues in revenue combined\n\nThat would kill uefa not the premier league\n\nI would not call it empty. But it is posturing. They have to do the posturing though, because FIFA struts around all the time against the smaller, poorer countries, banning them from international competiton, etc.\n\nAgainst a core European country. Er...\n\nThey cave very quickly under scrutiny in most western jurisdictions - you can google the bluster FIFA officials emitted from their face orifice when the FBI in US worked them over for all the corruption and chicanery in the footballing world in the Americas a decade ago or so.\n\nIf they want to and have sufficient motivation, I reckon a coalition of European clubs can assemble enough lawyers to tear a new one into those fair spending setups which UEFA and various European leagues have put up with the base as impinging on the EU's core freedom of movement of capital.\n\nUltimately sporting organisations like FIFA, UEFA are not above it, despite what they think they are.\n\nThe bids are made by the FAs of the countries. Not the governments. The current party in power in England wasn‚Äôt in power when the bid happened and was selected. They have no obligation to uefa to provide security if they decide not to.\n\nSo who is gonna enforce √≠t against the uk last time i checked fifa and uefa does not have an army\n\nI sort of agree with them, sort of. He makes good points, if their political interests interfere with the game in such a way that their political interests override the best interests of the league and football as a whole, that is a problem, and I do think that this sets at least some precedent for countries to be able to do that even if it doesn‚Äôt specifically allow for that within this legislation.\n\nBut at the same time there has been such rampant corruption and self interest that I do not believe that they can continue as is independently. They have basically outlined the specifics and I don‚Äôt think these their political interests with these policies can influence that.\n\nI‚Äôm sorry but I don‚Äôt think this is reasonable from UEFA, and I don‚Äôt think they would be this bold when it would in effect be a breach of contract to the euros bid. It would at the very least go to court if they acted on this and may end up with the euros not happening and severely impacting UEFAs finances and reputation, and I think they‚Äôre too self interested to go that route. So to be perfectly honest, this sounds like a total bluff.\n\nIt's OK for countries and governments to own and run clubs, just apparently not make rules surrounding the sport¬†\n\nThey profit off of it in one way and lose control in another. Corrupt cunts simple as that\n\n But the problem is FIFA and UEFA do allow government interference when they bribe them. It‚Äôs just corruption really.\n\nFIFA and UEFA would be unlikely to try it, imo. Every time a football authority makes a serious challenge against someone, be it the Premier League or FIFA or UEFA, it effectively puts its legitimacy on the line. Losing appeals of points deductions, losing a case against Super League conspirators, being made to look stupid by EA. Do they really want to try their hand against a whole country? They can't keep losing fights against people and still expect to be taken seriously and paid handsomely.\n\nEspecially against a country with a strong military, where football is basically the state religion.\n\nLike if UEFA or FIFA tried anything like that, like 90% of the country would legitimately support \"Using the SAS to go shoot them all in the face\"\n\nIronically one of the main driving forces behind appointing a football regulator is to prevent clubs breaking away and forming a super league again, which is in UEFAs best interests\n\nEvery government has the right to regulate the businesses that operate in their country. This is literally basic sovereignty.\n\nYeah but an organising body also has the right to deny access on that basis. The rights don‚Äôt really matter in this discussion.\n\nThe best interests of the league and football TO MAKE UNLIMITED MONEY FOREVER FOR ME AND MY PALS\n\nI fixed it for you.\n\nThis is silly bullshit. It's just corrupt interests in sport trying to prevent anyone from regulating their behaviour.\n\nFamously there are clubs in UEFA competitions that are owned by nation states. Of all the excuses they could come up with to block an independent regulator, taking up arms against ‚Äògovernment interference,‚Äô has to be the most laughable possible one\n\nThis just screams \"we have something to hide don't regulate us\".\n\nGame‚Äôs gone lads.\n\nGame was never back to begin with\n\nUEFA have got some bloody nerve thinking they can dictate what an elected government can and cannot do.\n\nGovernments can do whatever they want but if they want to be part of UEFA tournaments they have to comply with UEFA rules.\nThey can even decide that the game is played 12 V. 12 if they want or that the glorious team of the government‚Äôs party shall always be champion.\nBut FIFA/UEFA decides what the rules are for FIFA/UEFA competitions.\n\nProps on the english government for establishing their presence\n\nUK govt. There's no English govt,only country in UK not to have devolved govt\n\nJust do it. Even if they followed through on the threat, it's worth missing one tournament in my opinion and might have the added side effect of other nationals not blindly hating England quite so much. It's an empty threat though.\n\nI've been waiting for either FIFA or UEFA to make moves in this direction. The only real surprise is that UEFA got there first.\n\nI've regularly seen articles over the last 30 years about various nations being sanctioned over government interference. \n\nIt has been an official FIFA policy that national government's cannot interfere in the running of a national FA. Thus, it's not new, and it isn't specifically anti-English.\n\nWhat this means in the long run is not only the loss of EURO 2028 but more than likely the denial of access to UEFA club competitions as well as the FIFA club championship and World Cup. \n\nIt's not a battle that the FA wants. It knows that it can't and won't win. It depends 100% on government attitudes and whether it wishes to sacrifice English football.  One would expect compromises will have to be made.\n\n&gt;but more than likely the denial of access to UEFA club competitions\n\nDo you really think they would? That would more than likely restart the superleague plans, and hurt UEFA more than it would hurt England. \n\n&gt;It has been an official FIFA policy that national government's cannot interfere in the running of a national FA. Thus, it's not new, and it isn't specifically anti-English.\n\nAnd it's about tine we stop that. \n\nBecause corruption is running rampant in a system that UEFA and FIFA created. Where fans are turned into consumers. The health of the clubs/leagues outside of the top is unimportant. Player health isnt taken seriously at all. The number og games in uefa/FIFA tournaments increase every year as the two \"regulatory\" bodies tries to milk as much money as they can from European football success. \n\nIt's about time some of the big Football assosiations said anything. The smaller ones will just be silenced with threats like this. \n\nPlenty of countries, especially western ones are sick and tired of the corruption in both organisations. But helpless in actually doing anything, because of threats from UEFA and FIFA. \n\nThey aren't doing their job as regulators anymore. They are just trying to earn money, which should not be their end goal.\n\nInteresting how most people are easily able to grasp the need for regulation in football, but not in the rest of the ‚Äòfree market‚Äô\n\nScotland to win Euros and wc before England.\n\nEngland getting banned from their own euro would be peak comedy\n\nAnd somehow they'll still find a way to lose the final\n\nThrow the book at City\n\nFor the greater good\n\nFor how long will countries accept the blackmail from FIFA and UEFA? Every time any country tries to oversee the actions of its national football federation, they try to prevent it.\n\nLet's cut to the chase: how much do they want?\n\nUEFA only care because it'll highlight how poor their influence is.\n\nI can foresee the slogan changing from ‚Äúit‚Äôs coming home‚Äù to ‚Äúthey‚Äôre staying home‚Äù\n\nHow is that possible¬†\n\nNever happen\n\nUEFA and FIFA are corrupt as hell and will fight with everything they have to avoid any form of scrutiny.\n\nSolution is simple, scrap UEFA.\n\nJust pay them in Bentleys and rolls Royce cars until they are on our side\n\nMan city has done irreversible damage to the beautiful game\n\nYaa right .. just useless press\n\nNo chance. More chance of Fergie coming back into management\n\nClick bait - zero risk\n\n[deleted]\n\nNFL says Chiefs can't play in Super Bowl because of law proposed by Missouri state government\n\nUefa \"No No this wont do. Were the only ones who can meddle in the sport.

    "all_comment_text": "Why did they bother to exercise the one year option to extend his contract, this was always likely to be the case if he continued like last year, bigger payout for Ten Hag\n\n Because he won the FA cup\n\nTo demonstrate that they backed him in the hope he could turn it around‚Ä¶\n\nYeah but why tho\n\nEveryone is saying they kept him on because of the FA Cup win, but the real reason is that none of the people they were talking to over the summer wanted the job, of which Ten Hag was fully aware, so my guess is they went to him during his vacation and offered him the one year extension to make him believe he was wanted there.  \n  \n  \nIMO sacking him now instead of, say, late June is a terrible decision because not only does a new manager have to step in during the season, he has to deal with all of Ten Hags summer signings. Combine that with the absolute clobbering their new owner is taking in the media for some probably necessary but definitely painful cuts and it‚Äôs clear United are further away from where they want to be now than they have been since the decline began under Moyes.\n\nbecause when Alex Fergueson retired man utd board became dull\n\nWell can't say it wasn't coming\n\nAt this point it was easy to start believing he would be there for another 2 years, saying somewhere in 2026 that Man. United is still 'a work in progress'.\n\nHe was given a very fair amount of time to turn things around. Many managers were kicked out on much less margin.\n\nWe schtick to de plen\n\nWithout pulling that FA Cup out of his ass, it would have happened long ago.\n\nTo be fair, it was expected for so long (and never happened) that I started thinking he would just stay until the end of his contract in 2025. If they didn't sack him when they were sitting 14th in the table, might as well keep him\n\nGood radiance to bad rubbish\n\nYou made a glaring mistake.\n\nIt wasn't very bright of them\n\nIt's the only glowing review Erik's going to have from his time at United.\n\nIt wasn't comng. What you going to do about it? Huh?\n\nWhat are you trying to argue about?\n\nThink they were just trying to be funny, unsuccessfully\n\nHappy cake day\n\nTime to call Mourinho, he was interested in a PL club that wont play Uefa tournaments!\n\nMourinho would thrive at United if he receives the same backing ETH got with transfers and all\n\nPiffle.\n\nTime to call Mourinho a cunt and leave him exiled in Turkey.\n\nYeah but the PL is not the same without his entertainment factor. The latest one about the ref keeping one eye on him and one eye on the penalty incident showing why he is the best most incredible ref in the world was vintage and why I miss him. Not necessarily as the manager of my club though......\n\nWhy don't you do the same to your parents?\n\nMourinho fan boys are fucking cretins.\n\nU ok\n\nFine. You?\n\nChanging managers won‚Äôt fix a cultural problem. United‚Äôs issues go beyond tactics ‚Äì it's the whole setup, from top to bottom.\n\nExactly.  He didn't help himself but all the blame cannot be put on ETH, the players don't turn up consistently every week for the club.\n\nGetting the players to turn up consistently every week for the club is the manager‚Äôs job.\n\nSurely the players themselves need to own it and it‚Äôs not purely the manager‚Äôs job.\n\nFergie was a great man manager.  He knew what to say to each and every player to get the most of them, week in, week out.  \n\nThey turned up for him, and for the club because of the culture he created and fostered.\n\nAll that was thrown out when Moyes came in and got rid of all the staff for his own.  From there on out the culture has been toxic and the managers job is a poisoned chalice.\n\nNeed rebuilding from the ground up.\n\nTrue\n\nAlmost the entire structure was changed in the summer. What we don‚Äôt know is if it was changed from one rotten one to another rotten one.\n\nIs probably from an old rotten one to a new rotten one of people thinking that knows more than others\n\nTheir core is rotted. Organization needs a total revamp.¬†\n\nHow though? People have said this since Moyes. In that time, the owners have changed, football directors have changed, managers have changed and players have changed. I get that poor decisions continue to be made, but where is the inherent problem that needs to be resolved?\n\nThe glazers still exist\n\nThe club needs a vision of what they want to do. Then they should recruit coaches and players based on that. In well run clubs like Madrid and Liverpool, the coach doesn‚Äôt decide which player to buy or not, the club does. Right now Utd just want to be successful again. So they get a new coach, who brings in his players until the project doesn‚Äôt work and the coach gets sacked, leaving behind a host of players the new coach may not want. And this cycle keeps repeating itself.\n\nI think the coach has the deciding vote on whether to sign a player or not. The transfer committees, if you can call them that, identify and scout potential targets and will recommend signing a player they deem suitable for the club but the manager/head coach has the power to veto that if he does not agree. Klopp at Liverpool always had the final day.\n\nThe coach has a million other things to figure out already. If you have a clear vision of what kind of players you want and what kind of football you want to play, the sporting director, data analysts and others can identify suitable players better. You can still ask the coach what he‚Äôs missing in his squad but it‚Äôs inefficient to have him figure out targets and backup targets.\n\nPeople parrot the same thing over and over but don‚Äôt point to a concrete reason.\n\nExactly. \"the whole organisation needs to change\"\n\nSure - how?\n\n‚ÄúThe glazers‚Äù but what does that mean? What do the Glazers do wrong that another owner would do better? The reality is United has been choosing bad players and bad managers, and the league is much more competitive now when you look at how much money is pouring in. Brighton is making transfers United doesn‚Äôt do anymore, meanwhile United is dropping $100m on Antony.\n\nTell me you know nothing about it without telling me you know nothing about it. The Glazers have not had football people running the management side. They have been good at commercial side of it but have no clue when it comes to actual football. Which is why they had freaking Ed Woodward running things for so long. The guy literally said once that on pitch results don‚Äôt matter for a club like United. They haven‚Äôt invested in facilities or recruitment (scouts, I mean, not blindly spending millions for mediocre players). United is still top 3 when it comes to revenue but has a leaking roof. If you still seriously think Glazers are good owners, I‚Äôve got nothing more to say.\n\n‚ÄúFootball people running the management side‚Äù brilliant analysis. Give specific decisions the Glazers have done that you think another manager wouldn‚Äôt have, other than pick the wrong coaches and let them build the squads they want. \n\nI never said they‚Äôre good owners I said Reddit has no idea why they‚Äôre bad, just parroting that they believe they are.\n\nI just did lol. Ed Woodward has no place deciding football matters for any club, let alone one of United‚Äôs stature. They did not even know that a Director of Football is a minimum in modern football. Didn‚Äôt have a clue on how recruitment works. Didn‚Äôt know how to negotiate. Name just a single big club that would sign someone like Antony for the amount they did. And now let me tell you again, THE ROOF IS LEAKING. Does that not tell you how well they‚Äôve been running this club? Don‚Äôt even get me started on Football science and the medical team. You‚Äôre asking for specifics right after I specified what they‚Äôve been doing wrong lol.\n\nUnited had no Director of football, so it was not a ‚Äúchange‚Äù, the club just finally realized this isn‚Äôt the 90s anymore. The new owners and management has only been in for three months, they‚Äôre not magicians to turn around a decade of incompetence in a couple months. It‚Äôll take time.\n\nPeople on Reddit spout absolute shit. \n\nThey've literally done this the past 12 months. The entire structure changed, new people in, old people out.\n\nAnd that shows the club is beyond repair.\n\nWe have literally done that man.\n\nthat argument would have been valid before INEOS. Now there is a full football structure in the place. ETH takes the blame here after delivering a 14th place finish so far with his 600m spent on signings many of whom United let HIM pick out. This ownership excuses is tiresome\n\nIndeed. The entire system is rotten most likely\n\nI was thinking the same thing. This is a good start but it‚Äôs only a bandaid. They need to replace so many of their players too.\n\nWhat cultural problems?\n\nTen Hag brought in so much expensive dross to this club. If they do everything right from now they could be back challenging at the top in around five years, but that's a big if. There's not a whole lot to build on when it comes to their key players.\n\nIt‚Äôs a sad day for club football worldwide. What a great manager, if you ignore all the results where they lost or drew, he won every single game!!\n\nIt's a sad day for all non-united supporters.\n\nCouldn‚Äôt they have waited until my team played them.\n\nsome might even say: 2 and a half year too late\n\nCheer up, they'll probably hire Southgate next and piss away another few years.\n\nSome losses didn‚Äôt count. The Spurs game for example.\n\nGenuinely think he was fishing for the sack the past month or so. He had thoroughly checked out and just wanted the payday.\n\nAfter Mazraoui in CAM it was only a matter of time before he played Maguire up front\n\nHe did that, also with Bruno CB and Antony LB. And won.¬†\n\nNooooooooooo\n\nEnd of an era\n\nEras come to an end\n\nEnds come to eras, that's for sure.¬†\n\nOne of the eras in the history of football, no other way about it¬†\n\nThen RVN will get Man U to win 5 games in a row, and everyone will say, \" give him the permanent position mate, he's bloody brilliance\".... And once he signed as manager, Man U will lose 5 games in row....\n\nYep prepare to hear loads of bollocks about winning mentalities and the United way etc before inevitably the exact same cycle they've been on since Moyes starts up again.\n\nRemindMe!

Congrats. üòâ\n\nThis has been coming for quite some time, sure, but aside from his performance, I suspect the El Clasico pushed in the decision too. MU probably saw how quickly Flick turned things around there.\n\nat some point you have to realise, its the club not the managers.\n\nI believe this cuz I've seen how ex united players' graph changed post leaving.\n\n[deleted]\n\nBad take. ETH was amazing before Man United.\n\nAmazing as having one impressive season in the CL? \n\nThen why isn‚Äôt Leonardo Jardim praised the same?\n\nShould've gone in May. Dumb ass decision to keep him on after it was leaked they were going to sack him. Dumb to give him money to spend in the transfer window. Dumb to not give a new manager a pre-season to get used to the team.\n\nBut dumb is just how Utd operate these days.\n\nDidn't they even give him new contract in the summer?\n\nExtended the existing contract with one year.\n\nDalot got him sacked on purpose with that open goal miss\n\nNo, he‚Äôs just shit.\n\nIt won‚Äôt change for Manchester United until they are bought up by some organ wealth fund which, frankly doesn‚Äôt care too much about profit or loss. That‚Äôs the way football has been going for decades, Ferguson‚Äôs success and skill merely covered this up for a while as far as United were concerned. The longer they delay, the harder it is going to be to make any kind of recovery because the best players simply do not want to play for them anymore and it‚Äôs going to take a huge amount of money to convince them.\n\nWestham won the El Sackico\n\nNoooooooooooooo! I have Man U as being relegated\n\n\\*Steve Bruce waiting in the wings\\*\n\nThere's no way.\n\n\"I think we are all frightened a little bit when a new broom starts to sweep.\" \n\n\\[Steve Bruce\\]\n\nPlease Manchester United don't take xavi\nWith flick at Barcelona now. You can see how pathetic his work was...\n\nTeam misses sitters, manager gets the sack. Fergie was given 6 years before doing anything noteworthy.\n\nWho tf will want to come in halfway through the season now? Should have sacked him earlier or at the end of the season. Crap leadership, as always.\n\nBecause United were already shit before Fergie came and expectations were low. \n\nOle got sacked 4 months into the season after finishing top2 and expectations were high\n\nYou can‚Äôt go from 3rd to 14th over the course of 18 months\n\nThat's what you get for not using Antonio every game\n\nAs a Liverpool fan funny !\n\nCan someone post a gif of ronaldo smirking\n\nGlad Tuchel's not in the market, he would've been perfect for them. Hopefully they either give it to Van Nistleroy or Xavi. Amorim probably the most impressive available manager, so hopefully not him.\n\nAm hearing Gareth Southgate is No 1 choice and favourite to replace him.\n\nI would love to see that.\n\nWhy? He's won nowt !!\n\nGareth Southgate isn't a world-class football tactician, but United aren't a world-class club. They're not exactly in the market for a Pep or a Klopp.\n\n\nWhat Southgate did incredibly well with England though is take a deep-rooted culture and ethos in which great players seem to get worse the moment they put on the shirt, and turned it into one in which bang-average players get better. He got to a World Cup semifinal with a starting 11 that included Harry Maguire, Jesse Lingard, Dele Alli and Ashley Young. He got to a Euros final with a starting 11 that included Maguire again, Kalvin Phillips and Mason Mount.\n\n\nSouthgate might not be the person who'll win the league for United, but he might be exactly who they need to sort out the embedded losing culture there as a stepping stone towards it.\n\nI just think it would interesting and at worst funny. I'm not a Man Utd fan, so their success is not my concern.\n\nSo 'THE PROBLEM' got sacked? No shit\n\nOh no... I'm not sure if it's a wise decision to sack him. \nAs a Liverpool supporter I'm delighted that Man Utd established as a mid table team. \n\nShould keep him for 2 years or more.\n\ngod damn it, just in time for new manager bounce to kick in against us (chelsea). ffs\n\nit happened with ole. it happened with carrick to i think.\n\nIMO makes no sense if the players are shit, ten hag may not have been great, but I think the problem is with the players. What happens now if they bring a manager and they're still shit?\n\nHe spent 600m on players, it's partially his fault. His signings have mostly been terrible.\n\nFinally, I can see where it's going now though. Ruud will have a few good games. The fans will buy into it, he will get employed as a good cheap option and later it will fall apart. He's the assistant and also lead us to this situation and should be sacked too.\n\nI was hoping he‚Äôd stay there forever\n\nOwners look a shambles extending the contract then not backing him for the year, he‚Äôs genuinely been unlucky these last few games and performances were improving regardless of results!\n\nDang - so what will happen to this Ajax 2.0 man utd. Next manager(s) would sell them all. Anthony etc\n\nOh no! He hasn‚Äôt won the Skybet Championship with Man Utd yet..\n\nHe was not so bad, they could have waited till the end of the season considering the amount of entertainment we the rival fan's were having.\n\nHow long before Rio Ferdinand is on telly making a tit of himself again I wonder? \n\n\"Ruudy's at the wheel boys, United are BACK!\" ü§£ü§£\n\nToday is a dark day. Bald Ole was doing a great job.\n\nHitlers dead\n\nCalled it as a Dutchie 2 years ago. ManU is beyond repair and only still a big club in name, revenue and history. On sports and board side it's been awful for 10 years already. \n\nThere was nothing to win here for Ten Hag only things to lose inc his reputation and here we are.\n\nABOUT TIME TOO\n\nTook them long enough. Quick now do the players too\n\nTrust the process.\n\nThis is terrible news! They might improve now.\n\nShould have given him more time. Alex Ferguson needed at least about 5 years before he got success, and no one today complains about all those years without sucess.\n\nCR7 laughing somewhere in Saudi desert\n\nNow time to destroy another managera career\n\n17m payout for being a blameless twat, bring back Ole, now that he doesnt have to bwg Pogba to play he should do alrite...\n\nhttps://youtube.com/shorts/GjBWumJhACU?si=IN58e8Hmrwz7m9aV\n\nThey should have kept him on.\n\nFear of PAOK.\n\nWill they start clearing out ex-Ajax players and bring in Sporting ones?\n\npenaldogs are probably rejoicing rn ü§£\n\nI'm absolutely gutted. Two trophies in two seasons. He was the best manager they ever had. Every team in the PL will miss him.\n\n\nGood luck, Erik Two Trophies. Wish you stayed on longer. \n\n\nSincerely,\n\n\nLiverpool Supporter\n\nHe should have been fired after last season.\n\nWell, as a neutral, I'm gutted.\n\nBut Ronaldo was the problem\n\ni guess they couldn't let him cook.\n\nBring back Jose\n\nWow, they finally did it üòÖ\n\nI kinda feel bad for the next manager, that squad is not good and is far worse than the one ten hag inherited imo.\n\nAs a Chelsea fan, that‚Äôs a shame. I really like him at United. Was a great fit.\n\nI sad day for meme accounts and the soccerjerk sub\n\nAbsolutely gutted, was hoping we‚Äôd get another full season of this clown show\n\nI really liked watching him bottle games. Ah I will miss you ETH!\n\nShocking\n\nFinally üòÇ\n\nShouldve happened years ago\n\nI guess he'll go somewhere else and not wn trophies\n\nHe did win trophies lol.\n\nGive it Giggsy.\n\nHasn't he got court ?\n\nFuck sake. I was enjoying this circus. Hopefully it continues.\n\ni guess they couldn't let him cook.\n\nMust have been something he said.\n\nSuch a shame, I thought he was doing excellently.\n\nbUt WhY????\n\nThis is unbelievable. \n\nCould have won then the Carabao Cup this season!\n\nPresumably this isn't going to VAR?\n\nIt's a sad day...for the rest of PL üò≠\n\nWestham didnt read the room\n\nThe other 19 PL teams and top 3 championship sides have started to write a petition to reinstate Ten Hag.

He wouldn‚Äôt make the bench at any top level team in Europe and South America\n\nRonaldo is starting for al uittuhuda or whatever gtfo\n\nJota is sub for Liverpool and Ramos for PSG, gtfo.\n\nJota is Liverpool's best center forward. I don't know what you're talking about. \n\nJota's lack of game time is literally caused by him being unavailable through injury. If he's fit, he starts.\n\nLmao sub for any top 5 European club is better than saudi leagues starters. The only person from saudi league who'd start in an European club is Kante, and even he is so injury prone\n\nIn that case why is Messi a starter for Argentina? Because he is still better than his competition. Stop making shit up dudes. You can hate on Cristiano but reality is Portugal sucks. Except for Rafael Leao nobody is performing good, nobody.\n\nFirst of all Messi shouldn't be a starter either, he should be replaced by Alvarez. They're just playing him purely out of respect. But still Messi can work because Ronaldo is just a #9, take his goals out and he's basically useless (like Haaland). Messi even with no goals has created the most big chances in COPA America. Playmakers like Messi and KDB can play for a longer time because they bring too much to the table.\nAlso do you even watch football LMAO? Truth is almost everyone's performing except Ronaldo. Are you even watching the EUROs LoL?\n\nTell me you don't watch Portugal, without telling me.\n\nGood counterpoint\n\nI've watched every Portugal game. He should not be starting over Jota. He's made like 3 good plays in 4 games. Hes missing all his headers, he's so selfish on his free kicks, he can't finish, his passing has never been his strong suit. \n\nSuggesting he should start over Jota? Tell me you'll dickride Ronaldo no matter how pathetically he plays without telling me.\n\nThe issue is that he always wants to play. I hope he understands that age is not on his side again to keep playing all matches.\n\nAside from free kicks, Ronaldo has been pretty solid. By far from best player of tournament or portugal, but still dangerous on box. He has been quite unlucky not to score one or two goals. \n\nFunny that you brought penalties here, Ronaldo is still probably worlds best on them. At least I would pick him before anyone on clutch time penalty shot. Do you know last time he missed one before yesterday?\n\nDid you actually saw Portugal playing during this Euro? Sure, Ronaldo was unlucky sometimes, but saying he has been by far the best player is a massive overstatement. His performance has been very subpar, even if we don't consider the usual high expectations for a player of such calibre in this kind of tournaments.\n\nHowever, as a portuguese, I hope he proves me wrong in the next game against France.\n\nLmao learn to read. \"By far from best\" doesn't mean he is the best. That means he is far from best. Haha\n\n[removed]\n\nThat's horrible fucking English lmao. Don‚Äôt tell someone to learn to read when you write like an illiterate. This is hilarious.\n\n&gt; Do you know last time he missed one?\n\n2 days ago. I hope that helps ‚ò∫Ô∏è\n\nI agree with everything you said, but surely you're aware that he missed one on Monday?\n\nSure, meant last time before that. He had something like +20 penalties scored on row.\n\nAh okay, makes sense.\n\nBest option. He‚Äôs not even the best option now\n\nI was thinking why would Sergio Ramos develop into starter for Portugal.\n\nHis presence *seems* like a net negative to this team.\n\nHe has already stated that this would be his last World Cup and then he will retire. Pepe will retire as well.  \n  \nI really hope they win\n\nHe‚Äôll be at the World Cup to make people happy.\n\nI don‚Äôt think he‚Äôll be called up\n\nHow is this news though? He would be 43 when the next tournament comes around.\n\nConsidering that 41 year-old Pepe is still there, the question is not necessarily an idle one.\n\nThere‚Äôs a reason CBs tend to have a lot more guys playing in to their mid/late 30s. \n\nI‚Äôm in my mid 30s now and play a lot still. When I play in my over 30 league I can play wherever and tend to play the 6 or 10 role. When I play with my friends who are in their early 20s, CB is the only position I can really keep up at.\n\nYou can tell he's not as quick or agile.  It's still world class but definitely a step behind what he used to be able to do.  Also can't jump as high, a lot of balls just fly over his head.\n\nForwards need pace more than centre backs, though.\n\nHe's still faster than lots of other strikers. Kane has always been slow for example, yet is one of the best forwards in the world.¬†\n\nThere are always outliers. In cricket James Anderson is still England‚Äôs best bowler at 42, and would keep going were he not being forced to retire.\n\nThere are outliers, but with all due respect to cricket, it‚Äôs not comparable to football in terms of fitness requirements.\n\nI‚Äôm also not saying Ronaldo couldn‚Äôt play at 43, but he couldn‚Äôt offer more than someone younger could.\n\nFast bowlers tend to retire early because it causes their body stress , so james anderson is an outlier like pepe\n\nBeing a fast bowler is close, at least in terms of wear and tear if not fitness. Most of those guys have their bodies explode from the constant impact on their muscles and joints.\n\nWhat on earth are you saying? Bowlers get ruined and play year round all over the world. There is absolutely a huge physical demand to throwing 149KMPH balls repeatedly.\n\nThat‚Äôs what I mean though. They bowl very fast, but in terms of cardio it seems pretty chill as there is so much rest in between. \n\nThe stress on the joints is a valid point, but I was thinking of the cardio side.\n\ntry running 40 metres in the heat a whole day atleast 60 times and then tell us if it requires cardio\n\nDepends on what you do as a cricketer. Spinner or some batsmen could go into their 40s. Fast bowlers put more stress on their joints (particularly knees and ankles) than footballers do.\n\nThis statement clearly is coming from someone with a low understanding of what it takes to be being a fast bowler who plays test cricket for as long as Jimmy has done\n\nYou got that right, I don't have a clue, tbh. I used to play cricket as a kid though, all I remember is that there was a huge amount of resting involved, whereas the football matches were non-stop running.\n\nRonaldo at 43 would still be better then most strikers.¬†\n\nTf is that comparison\n\nHe‚Äôs arguably not good enough to be playing in this one even. He‚Äôs played 4 games with some of the best playmakers in the world behind him, he‚Äôs had 20 shots and he‚Äôs scored approximately zero of them. He bagged one assist in the 3-0 against Turkey and he scored in a penalty shootout, but he hasn‚Äôt exactly had a good tournament so far. \n\nIt‚Äôs still up for debate if they would be better off playing someone else up top but there is no way he is good enough in another 4 years to be selected again, regardless of whether he‚Äôs willing or not.\n\nHe has been perfectly serviceable this tournament and as someone who has actually watched Portugal, he's the best number 9.\n\nName one other striker who has had a great tournament as well.\n\nI mean, Gakpo's been good.\n\nMikautadze as well\n\nHave you watched any of the games? He‚Äôs been a threat in all of them. He‚Äôs absolutely not a wasted space and has simply been unlucky in front of goal. There‚Äôs multitudes of strikers and attackers that have had a worse tournament than he has and they‚Äôre not the ones who are almost 40 lol\n\nHe‚Äôs been unlucky in front of goal. How many goals does Kane have? 1?\n\n2\n\nHe's already past it, only the fanboys don't know it\n\nHe should have retired by then.\n\nHis plan is obviously retiring after the next World Cup, in two years. Quite optimistic of him imo, but he will probably make it even if on the bench.\n\nHe owns the national team, he would play even if he was a limp.\n\nKind reminder that Portugal won the Euro Cup when Ronaldo was on the bench.\n\nBecause he got injured. It's not like he didn't start the final\n\nExactly. I don't understand why people act as if it was his fault, or he didn't have a major impact throughout the whole tournament.\n\nTbf he had a target posted on his back that game, it was clear that he would  be forced to leave early.\n\nHe got injured playing that match.\n\nShowed so much decline at this Euro. He just can't go with the pace of the game anymore.\n\nYeah. People clap when he even kicks the ball and pretending like he still got it. As sad it sounds, it's nearly over. Just be glad we've witnessed the greatest rivalry in football\n\nNo one thinks he's in his prime anymore. His longevity of being the man hasn't been present since he had a shit professional and personal year in 2022.\n\nThat being said, he's not some washed bum that people make him out to be and he's Portugal's best option upfront.\n\nWhat happened to him personally in 2022?\n\nI think he had twins and one of them died after birth.\n\nTo be honest, 80% of Portugal players have been awful or mediocre at best in this EURO. I mean, Ronaldo has an excuse, the guy is nearly 40, but what‚Äôs Leao‚Äôs excuse? Bruno‚Äôs? Bernando‚Äôs? Neves‚Äô? Palhinha‚Äôs? Dalot‚Äôs? They aren‚Äôt even 30 yet and they haven‚Äôt made a significant difference on the pitch thus far. \n\nRonaldo plays as a centerforward now, his job is not to create plays or dribble past 3 defenders on the left like when he was 23 at Man United. His job is to score goals. How is he supposed to score goals if he hasn‚Äôt had a *clear* open play goal opportunity in 4 games? \n\nYes, it‚Äôs obvious he‚Äôs resenting his age, and he can‚Äôt do some of the things he was able to do 2 or 3 years ago, but you can‚Äôt blame everything on him when most of his much younger teammates are playing just as bad or even worse, some way worse.\n\nDid you watch the games? He‚Äôs had multiple clear open play opportunities - Bruno‚Äôs put him through, so has Vitinha and Bernardo. He‚Äôs just passed it to the keeper every time. In fact, he currently has the highest xG in the tournament.\n\nHe‚Äôs just not good enough to sacrifice a spot for anymore. He doesn‚Äôt add anything to the team, doesn‚Äôt track back, doesn‚Äôt press. It‚Äôs playing a man down but now he‚Äôs not a goal threat anymore either.\n\nThat's his job though. Sometimes he will miss sometimes he will make. Mbappe also has a very high xG this tournament. It's not playing a man down considering that he has improved his creation a lot (partly due to his wastefulness) and still demands so much gravity.\n\nHighest xG of any CF in the tournament\n\nRonaldo had the worst xG underperformance at the last euros and among the worst in the last World Cup¬†\n\nLet it go buddy\n\nJust facts¬†\n\nWell, this can be very disingenuous. It depends on what you are judging Cristiano Ronaldo on. Are you judging him on the standard of Cristiano Ronaldo at his current age? Or the standard of 39 year old player?\n\nYou state that 80% of players for Portugal are awful or mediocre at best, and Cristiano belongs in that 80%. The issue is that Martinez doesn't have the balls to bench Cristiano without it being a double-edged decision. He should have been taken off vs Slovenia, oddly enough he only stayed on the pitch with the off chance the game goes to penalty shoot-out.\n\nCristiano has the highest xG at the Euros, along with the most shots taken. Where Cristiano is getting sympathy, Lukaku is getting absolutely destroyed for. So, objectively Cristiano is getting great goal scoring opportunities where he isn't converting.\n\nAlso, Goncalo Ramos isn't even been given a proper chance just because he has been branded as lesser than. The fact is that Cristiano, perhaps isn't impeding Portugal, but he also isn't progress nor helping the team. How is Goncalo Ramos meant to be better for Portugal if he isn't given CONSISTENT game time to demonstrate that he is, at least a viable option. Forget Ramos, Jota should be starting ahead of Cristiano.\n\nLiterally no? Have you seen his play?\n\nStill tearing it up in Saudi whereas others are not\n\nThe vast majority of forwards range from terrible to average on this competition. Mbappe has only scored 1 penalty in 3 games. Kane has been completely anonymous besides the winning goal vs Slovakia. Havertz, Lukaku, Morata, Hojlund and the Italy strikers have been shit as well.\r  \n\r  \nThe only good strikers in the competition have been the guys from Georgia and Slovakia, so far.\r  \n\r  \nYet, weirdly enough, I never see a million posts about Morata, Hojlund, Scamacca, Lukaku, Depay should get benched/retire/give their teammates a chance. Only German fans shitted Havertz and wanted to start Fullkrug, but Naggelsman doesn't care.\r  \n\r  \nAnd yes, Ronaldo isn't the same guy he was on his 20s or even mid-30s anymore. I know it, you know it, everyone knows it. But if people stopped comparing him to his old self and actually compared him to the rest of the strikers in this competition, you'll see that he's alright, decent even. He was one of the best players on the pitch vs Turkey and even vs Slovenia he had some good chances.\n\nHe needs his teammates doing more for him, and they need to step up.\n\n*Sad suii noises*\n\n_siu_\n\n_noooo_\n\nHas won it already so no regret\n\nI'm a Messi fan but I can only respect Ronaldo's heritage on the beautiful game.\n\nYeah no shit\n\nShouldn't be surprised, but the reaction to him crying was a joke by people who lack empathy or basic emotional understanding.\n\nRobert Baggio had a storming tournament in 1994 and yet all he's remembered for is missing that penalty in the final. Baggio did an interview recently where he still says he loses sleep over it. Now, Ronaldo is in a league of his own due to his longevity and this pen miss wouldn't have tainted that legacy, but how can you blame a man who was legit cursed in front of goal and missed a penalty for crying when that very well could've been the reason Portugal lost?\n\nPaul Gascoigne also once cried mid-game after getting booked, which would've prevented him playing the next game, yet these same twats in the media will big up Gazza, but slate Ronaldo for it.\n\nBeing a captain doesn't prevent you from being emotional. These Portuguese players also look up to him and clearly rallied behind him. It inadvertently makes your will to win go up to see someone you look up to be so emotionally vulnerable.\n\nNot to mention the sociopaths genuinely trying to spin his tears as \"inauthentic\" or \"selfish\".\n\nRetards who have never been involved in a sport, or any sort of emotional turmoil.\n\nHating on a goat whilst he‚Äôs still playing is crazy‚Ä¶ worlds gone mad\n\nBecause he shouldnt be playing, at least not as a starter. Hes holding Portugal back badly\n\nHe's actually not if you watch the games instead of wanking your hate-boner to him.\n\nHis finishing was the only thing that let him down against Slovenia. His general attacking play was literally the only thing Portugal had down the middle, and the crosses weren't particularly great again.\n\nRamos will offer more energy, but he is worse at every other aspect compared to Ronaldo. Jota should be playing, but he should playing in behind Ronaldo if he's on the pitch. The lack of runners in the middle is an issue for Portugal.\n\nHis finishing is the only thing he has at this stage of his career. He doesn‚Äôt press. He doesn‚Äôt track back. He doesn‚Äôt even have a good first touch anymore. If his finishing is letting him down, he‚Äôs offering nothing.\n\n&gt;He doesn‚Äôt track back.\n\nFamously, strikers track back deep when their team is out of possession.\n\n&gt;He doesn‚Äôt press.\n\nWhy would he need to press when Portugal have dominated the ball in all their games?\n\nThis is a negative IQ take from you.\n\n&gt;If his finishing is letting him down, he‚Äôs offering nothing.\n\nExcept his link up play and attacking positioning which is literally the only good thing Portugal have had through the middle in all 4 games.\n\nHis ego doesn‚Äôt match his ability anymore and it‚Äôs holding Portugal back massively. The football equivalent of Biden still trying to run for president\n\nCan understand where you are coming from mate. Especially with all the free kicks, lack of pressing etc. etc. \n\nBut taking a risk on the greatest goal scorer of all time, captain, and leader? \n\nFine by me. \n\nTournament football is about moments, and when you have a player that can literally produce something out of nothing, proven time and time again. \n\nIt's worth taking the risk imo.\n\nthe leader who broke down crying in the middle of extra time and needed his teammates to console him? \n\nIf he broke down after the game it's kinda excusable. but before the game even reached it's conclusion? like the game doesn't even matter he's too focused on his goal scoring record.\n\nHe is a genius, he brought the team together in that moment.\n\nlike Messi did back in 2016 when he retired xD\n\nMessi fan detected.\n\n\"Why is someone being emotional after almost costing his national team?\"\n\nYou do realize that not every captain has to be a stoic figure? Your argument is stupid considering their heads didn't drop after the fact. Pepe lacking pace and being tired was the only reason Sesko got that chance.\n\nOr maybe just maybe the guy feels bad for letting his country down and missing a penalty that would have put them through but just a thought\n\nimagine your general started bawling in the middle of an active battle field. would you call them a leader let alone a good one?\n\nIt wasn‚Äôt active though it was at half time and I‚Äôm not disagreeing it‚Äôs misplay on Ronaldo‚Äôs part I‚Äôm saying your reasoning of him just wanting to maintain a goal record reeks of nonsense\n\nhim crying for his goal record is a reach, yes. I'm honestly clueless why he let himself go like that while there was still more to be played. It was not ideal. I don't know if i've ever seen someone cry when there's still 15min left to be played.\n\nHe led the team into 0-3 on perfect penalties and saves. You'd have a point if they hadn't all smashed it after.\n\nnah that's exactly why I have a point. what kinda leader breaks down and needs consoling from his teammates when there's still game left to be played. his teammates had to collect themselves after their captain missed a penalty and broke down. They are the one's who smashed it.\n\nDid you forget he took the first penalty and redeemed himself?\n\nredeemed himself? are you serious? ew yall are really defending this performance? \n\nthe penalty he missed would have won Portugal the game. The one he scored in a shootout put them ahead only after Diogo Costa stopped the first shot. Credit goes to Diogo Costa for the shootout win. tryna spin it as Ronaldo leading the team is pathetic.\n\nIf you watched the game, he was far from terrible and he is better than Ramos at almost everything except stamina and probably even pace.\n\nwould you say that he redeemed himself and lead the team?\n\nIm not defending his performance, I'm defending the penalty miss. Dude went first and nailed his penalty after the fact, and the rest of the team stepped up and made theirs. To say that didn't affect his team's win at all but then say his crying did is dumb.\n\nBro tame your hate boner of Ronaldo down. I'm pretty neutral about the guy but you acting like he was horrible when he was directly involved with their win is dumb.\n\nIt was Diogo Costa who saved the first penalty and gave the advantage to his team. He set the tone. \n\nAn extra time penalty miss is a huge deal especially for the best penalty taker. idk why you are still defending it.\n\nyou're the good one with your BMI at 30 and your cheetos covered fingers \n\ndude saw his mom on the screen crying after he missed the pen and couldnt hold it together, big deal. he had the balls to go first and scored it\n\nedit: lmao your comment history shows he lives rent free in your head. insane. get that checked out.\n\nnah I'm fit af\n\ndid he tell you he saw his mom cry and that's why he broke down in the middle of the game? If in the video instead of cutting to his mom crying I edited in a clip of SpongeBob ripping his pants would you believe that's what made him cry?\n\nI'm obsessed with Ronaldo fans. My comment history actually doesn't show how obsessed I truly am. I love it especially when they are very stubborn and I can keep bringing them back to reality. Their goat is not who they claim he is.\n\nim sure you are buddy. no, his bimbo sisters explained it. not that I care, but seeing your kind of people talking about high pressure world class players mentality like you know anything about being in that kind of mindset is always hilarious.\n\nwash your hands buddy, you reek of cheetos.\n\n&gt;His ego doesn‚Äôt match his ability anymore and it‚Äôs holding Portugal back massively\n\n\\*Me when I lie for literally no reason.\n\nWatch football instead of getting your takes from twitter.\n\nMartinez's awful substitutions are the reason Portugal are getting held back as well as Bruno and Bernardo having terrible games on Monday.\n\nEverything has a beginning, a middle and an end. EVERYTHING. Sorry to get all existential on you but EVERYTHING comes to an end, including Ronaldo. Let it go. His productivity has CLEARLY significantly declined. Find another hero.\n\nlol, OBVIOUSLY he isn't the player he was in 11/12... but teams are often set up to play around one player. \n\nFrance has Mbappe. \n\nEngland has Jude. \n\nPortugal has Ronaldo. \n\nThe Portugal coaching staff has clearly closely observed him this season and deemed he good enough to still be that man. But you know better obviously...\n\nNot just me dude. Nearly every football pundit worth his or her salt is saying the same thing, so time to smell the coffee, but not before you wake up\n\nThank goodness üòÖ no more theatrical free kick misses and the camera operator panning to his Botox face.\n\nand no more getting blinded by his shiny veneers.\n\nNo more tantrums and stropping about at every minor inconvenience, the man's more diva than prime Mariah Carey for fuck sake\n\nSo much hate in comment section. Also, last time I checked he hasn‚Äôt been arrested for the rape charge.\n\nThey are a bunch of edgy teenagers who started watching ball 2 years ago. It‚Äôs best to just ignore them, they‚Äôll probably never see a player like Ronaldo again in their lifetimes once he retires.\n\nThere was proof\n\nPeople down voting facts. classic reddit\n\n[removed]\n\nHow will Portugal replace his incredible prowess from free kicks?\n\nLooking quite bad considering Bruno is the 2nd best option and he hasn't scored one in over a year.\n\nThere's concrete proof of a lot of things that don't see legal reprimands, especially when people are rich and famous. Marcos Alonso, definitely, 100%, killed a woman. He never saw punishment.\n\nSurely you can use Google donkey and research / figure out why is that \nhttps://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/cristiano-ronaldo-new-documents-emerge-in-rape-allegations-a-1241349.html\n\nTelling me to do research when you clearly haven't done any is classic reddit.\n\nTwo alleged questionnaires exist, one where Ronaldo seemingly admits to it, the other where he denies it. Ronaldo's lawyers claim the documents have been fabricated by the footballeaks hacker (keep in mind, these are the same leaks that claimed Benzema was part of a drug cartel) **so there is no way of knowing who is telling the truth.**\n\nAs far as why Ronaldo paid her off, let's break this down simply for a simpleton like yourself:\n\nRonaldo had just moved to Madrid at the time, what do you think his legal team advised him to do? Publicly deny the allegations and have a massive PR cloud hang over him, or give her pocket change to him?\n\nFirstly the charges weren‚Äôt dropped because he was innocent, rather because the evidence was taken illegaly.\n\nSecondly the documents are indeed from a trustworthy source. It‚Äôs funny seeing you trying to discredit football leaks, who has notoriously been pretty reliable with their leaks and who has gotten ronaldo convicted for tax evasion for example. He‚Äôs obviously not perfect, but he‚Äôs been largely accurate\n\nWhy did you tag me in your post rather than just... replying to me? Also, some explanation would be appreciated. I could list 100 celebrities who have concrete proof of wrongdoing but were never punished for it.\n\n[deleted]\n\nThe conviction rates for actual rape are depressingly low\n\nYeah because of the usual lack of indisputable evidence. Not because judges have a soft spot for obvious rapists.\n\nRape is a very hard thing to 100% prove, that‚Äôs why.\n\nwhy are you acting as if the justice system is efficient, let alone when persecuting the rich and famous\n\n[deleted]\n\n[deleted]\n\nCan you please point to where that evidence was verified to be unaltered and verified?\n\nWhen you can't, you have to say that you're a nonce.\n\n[deleted]\n\nSo now that you've folded over simple questioning, you have confirmed you are a nonce.\n\nThat was easy.\n\nDunno.. you might be right but end of the day that is speculation. The fact is he isn‚Äôt convicted, and with things like this it‚Äôs really all you can go off\n\nHasn‚Äôt been arrested because he refuses to go to the USA.\n\nhow do you explain away the questionnaire with his attorney where he openly admits to roughly raping her? he paid her off.\n\nI don‚Äôt need to explain anything, he hasn‚Äôt been brought forward to a court of law. My opinion on if he did it or not doesn‚Äôt make any difference, so why even bother?¬†\n\nüê´\n\nüòû hopefully Portugal makes a far run this tourney\n\nDoes this mean Portugal may get a free kick that isnt smashed over the bar?\n\nFun fact: Ronaldo is the last man united player to score a free kick and a hattrick. He hasn't played for them in 2 years.\n\nI love how people act like players score free kicks all the time. There hasn't been 1 this tournament.\n\nI love Bruno, but the fact he's getting away with having an absolute stinker on Monday and people are hyping up his lacklustre free-kick ability is just lazy digs at Ronaldo.\n\nOther than that one he blew wide, they weren't awful free-kicks.\n\nLol exactly. People burying Ronaldo for an average performance at 39 years old, yet Bruno is supposed to be at his peak and the current star of the team, yet nobody bats an eye at his subpar performance so far.\n\nRonaldo acts as a heat magnet absorbing all the criticism from the rest of the team.\n\nThe midfield went to pieces when Vitinha went off. There's literally nothing helping Ronaldo in the middle that he may as well be writing poetry. He has to come deep or have two cbs press him because there's no runners helping him. \n\nMartinez took Leao off when he was rinsing their rb and Cancelo had to cover the right because Bernardo was useless on the right again. He's got no 1v1 ability and created nothing in the middle.\n\nBruno was playing deep and delivering shit ball after shit ball.\n\nBut because Ronaldo can't leap like a horse anymore, can't score banger free-kicks like he used to, and dares to show emotion, it's his fault. It's so insane the level of derangement hate he attracts.\n\nHe's certainly lost the magical spring in his step ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\n\nNaaah, he is good until 50!\n\nHe‚Äôs stunk this one up tbf\n\nYeah, nice try \nI‚Äôll wait to hear him say it\n\nThanks fk god for that. He was a great player but at this point he is more of a liability than an asset to the Portuguese team. Not only due to his fault  (I think he is still a good substitute option) but the idiot managers are too afraid to put him on the bench...\n\nDid anyone think otherwise? He's arguably the greatest footballer Portugal ever produced and has been recognized as such for... decades! That's quite an accomplishment over a period of time that eludes most professional footballers. I am and always was a Barca and Messi fan, but that has never taken away from my appreciation of the sheer work ethic, professionalism, longevity and quality he brought. What a beast of a player!\n\nYeah, we can see that.\n\nThe best #2 player ever.\n\nHe is blocking the next Ronaldo from coming through. We wouldn't have the CR7 we have seen over the years if there was a 50 year old player stinking up the place thinking he's still the king when CR7 was up and coming trying to break into the team.\n\nFootball is dead now! üò≠\n\nThank god it‚Äôs been sad and frustrating seeing him upfront the last two tournaments\n\nThe real culprits are Bernardo and Bruno who can't do jack shit\n\nIt happens and is normal, time is unforgiving. Probably will retire after world cup. Just like barcelona declining from football heritage one of the best clubs to 9 years without a UCL title.\n\nYou get peaks and trenches\n\nLike it‚Äôs a suprise.. Aint no 43 old striker going to another Euro, even if it‚Äôs CR7 himself. Bro still a human.\n\nThank God!\nHopefully we can focus the Team instead of the individual.\n\nTo be honest I dont think he meets the same skill level as before anymore I think this is a really good decision. He left a huge mark in Europe its time to move on boss.\n\nHe's done enough, and helping them win the trophy some years back will be remembered as a great moment.\n\nMan to be honest, I hope he wins even tho it's not likely. I truly hope for the sake of the goat debate\n\nI hope he doesn‚Äôt play the next world cup. It‚Äôs time for the next generation to come in.\n\nWhat he desperately needs is to return to European football back home in Portugal with either Sporting or Benfica to tune himself back up to a good standard of football, he's so behind the pace with his Portugal team mates that he's actually became a negative player, it's like having 1 man sent off when he's on the pitch, I genuinely think he's been that poor.\n\n.kjljlgdj oooooppps\n\nOne last Championship for my legend Cameldo üí™\n\nNo shit, he‚Äôll be 43. I‚Äôm fed up of these Ronaldo fan boys who justify his bad performances and say he‚Äôs still playing really well.  He‚Äôs 39, he‚Äôs still very good technically but physically he struggles to compete at this level.  His ego has been hugely dented this tournament as he‚Äôs finally realised this.\n\nAfter scoring 50 goals in a poor Saudi league to return to the top level at the Euros and not being able to compete he has realised this.  \n\nAnd yes, the Saudi league is poor, it‚Äôs attracted top class midfielders and attackers but in the whole, the defenders are of amateur quality and it‚Äôs very easy to score.  \n\nI get young guys can be huge fans and they don‚Äôt like people to diss Ronaldo but if you‚Äôre in your twenties and you‚Äôre all over Ronaldo defending everything he does and hating on Messi you need to grow up.\n\nBye\n\nTwo Euros too late.\n\nHe was the top goalscorer in the last Euros and won the Euros the tournament before that.\n\nUnless seeing Ronaldo being successful is a bad thing to you, your comment makes zero sense.\n\nThank God ü´°\n\nWho penaldo ?\n\nJudging by the way he‚Äôs playing that‚Äôs not his choice\n\nHe will be heading off rap(e)idly into the sunset after this then.\n\nDick sucking rate will Fall like the price of a failing crypto coin"

It's a genius idea, that I'm surprised isn't more popular.\n\nWhere can I buy this new and innovative idea\n\nYour local Travel Agent, they might call it a \"holiday\" whatever the fuck that means\n\nOr a mini-retirement planner.\n\nAlright thanks, that makes sense now\n\n*whereby\n\nNot that popular, at this moment in time, but I‚Äôm sure it will catch on.\n\nA vacation?\n\nYes that's the joke\n\n[Ben Kelly on X: \"Absolutely dying at this clip of Gary Neville seeming to discover what a holiday is https://t.co/BnELj9p6iP\" / X](https://x.com/bkelly776/status/1661039204975927297)\n\nI think that's more of a symptom of the kind of shitty \"grind\" culture that twats like Stephen Bartlett (the guy he's talking to in that clip) try and push. \n  \nThe way he says \"I won't think about work...well, I do but that's just because it's the way people like you and I are\". \n  \nHe knows it's a holiday, or a mini-break. But when you're trying to sell a work culture like this, you have to rebrand it as something stupid like a \"mini retirement\".\n\nTbf most high achievers are absolute nut cases when it comes to working, sure some people do peddle the \"sigma grindset\" nonsense but a lot of the most successful people in society will tell you themselves that they work far too much for it to ever be healthy\n\nIn this case it probably was healthy in Gary‚Äôs playing days at least\n\nYeah it's just hard for them to find the off switch after their careers over, like a lot of inner city detectives often drop dead after retirement because their body physically can't handle going from such constant high stress to minimal amounts\n\nThat‚Äôs true of any job though‚Ä¶.the bodies used to a routine then you remove it and have no routine.\n\nWhat's the issue with Bartlett\n\nHe's one of those insufferable \"look how hard I work\" types, and for me a terrible example for young people who should seek to have a work-life balance in their careers. \n  \nI also get the impression that he's not so much a successful businessman, but someone who makes a living purely talking about how successful they are.\n\nHe‚Äôs the guy on Dragons Den who only seems interested if a product has gone viral on tik tok.  He‚Äôs an insufferable bellend\n\nI think thats the case with most of if not all the motivational podcaster types. They're biggest success is talking about their success.\n\nThanks,  it makes sense now\n\nOne of the latest episodes of the Overlap or Stick to Football, whatever venture it is, he was so excited about dunking biscuits in tea and was telling the staff and us the viewers to try if if you haven't, like he'd discovered fire or something.\n\nThis is exactly what it is from every angle of assessment I can think of.¬†\n\nThe Mitchell and Webb sketch about football is as relevant as ever\n\nThere‚Äôs still all to play for and forever to play it in!\n\n^[Sokka-Haiku](https://www.reddit.com/r/SokkaHaikuBot/comments/15kyv9r/what_is_a_sokka_haiku/) ^by ^Vingilot1:\n\n*The Mitchell and Webb*\n\n*Sketch about football is as*\n\n*Relevant as ever*\n\n---\n^Remember ^that ^one ^time ^Sokka ^accidentally ^used ^an ^extra ^syllable ^in ^that ^Haiku ^Battle ^in ^Ba ^Sing ^Se? ^That ^was ^a ^Sokka ^Haiku ^and ^you ^just ^made ^one.\n\nGood bot\n\nI wish he‚Äôd stop commentating on games. He gets into a negative death spiral very quickly, just tell us what is happening in the game Gary.\n\nEvery time he does one of his loud \"Oh No's\", my brain releases the same chemical cocktail it releases when my alarm goes off at 6am on a Monday.\n\nMake that your alarm sound for extra suffering\n\nThat's 4D chess!\n\nHa, I just get Microsoft Teams ringtone in my head when he says Oh no.\n\nLol you nailed it with that analogy, it absolutely fills me with dread.\n\nHe's not a *good* co-commentator, but I must admit I do always chuckle when does his \"OOOOOOEHH\" whenever something mildly dramatic happens.\n\nHis joyous squeal when he's enjoying something is enough to make me wish only (slightly) bad things on him.\n\nWait are you saying you don't appreciate such insight as \"definitely the worst yanited performance I've seen for a long time\"?\n\nAt least we've not heard him mention the glazers for a while!\n\nHe shouldn't be commenting on Liverpool games either, the clear bias comes through on every decision.\n\nBloody hell.... It's an \"OWHHHHHHH\" a minute when he's on Liverpool games.\n\n\nFeels like every Liverpool tackle needs to go to the monitor.\n\n\nBall blasted from a foot away, straight into a player's chest where his hand is, albeit trying to stay out of the way - that's an \"OWHHHHHHH\"\n\n\nSlide and reach the ball first in the area, opponent trips over a yard off the ball - that's an OWHHHHHHH\"\n\n\nShoulder to shoulder \"OWHHHH\"\n\n\n_\"Could be in trouble here‚Ñ¢\"_\n\nThe problem is, who replaces him? I genuinely can‚Äôt think of a good commentator. I‚Äôd pay extra for a ‚Äúcrowd noise only‚Äù option.\n\nDon‚Äôt give them any ideas for extra money please!\n\nEvery club should take the Leipzig approach and give them dodgy mics that don‚Äôt work\n\nI understood this reference\n\nWe used to have this when Sky Digital launched. \n\nYou could choose which commentary you had. Fan commentary. Crowd noise. Player cam where you could focus a camera on one player for the whole half.\n\nWe have that in France, it's great (although PL commentators are good i must say)\n\nI had the option on a match recently, I think it was a Champions League match on Amazon Prime. Other than that, most games are on Sky or TNT and they‚Äôll never offer the option.\n\nSky did it 25 years ago\n\nThe other day on NBC I think the commentators were having technical difficulties during the Liverpool-RBL match and the first half was almost entirely crowd noise\n\nYeah it was the same on TNT, mostly for the first 20 minutes or so. Apparently it was an issue from Leipzig‚Äôs equipment rather than any of the broadcasters, but it was much better.\n\nThat's interesting that you mention that, I would have thought that each broadcaster would bring their own equipment to the show.\n\nCould put a sack of potatoes there, I guess.\n\nNot sure the salary it would command, though\n\nYou can't think of any because they don't let any come from the outside.\n\nWhere's the Scottish guy who loses his mind over messi\n\nI think you mean Ray Hudson and last I checked he was a Geordie! His Messi commentary was on another level.\n\nMcCoist, maybe? He‚Äôs probably the best of a bad bunch, but his ‚Äúbanter‚Äù with ‚ÄúFletch‚Äù is unbearable.\n\nFletch being the American sounding guy? Worth it for when he loses it over a \"magisterial\" play haha\n\nOh, that‚Äôs Ray Hudson. He‚Äôs from the North East of England, played 25 games for Newcastle in the 1970s and then came over to the US to play, then coach, then commentate.\n\nOh wow, he has such a neutral accent for a man from the North East of England; midatlantic's finest haha\n\nNo Ray Hudson is the one you think is Scottish but he‚Äôs actually geordie\n\nAhhh thank you for letting me know! Wouldn't want to make that mistake in person\n\nHis worst trait as a commentator/pundit for me is his bias towards English players, Neville very rarely criticises them &amp; if someone questions performance/desire etc. regarding a certain player let‚Äôs say Marcus Rashford for example he‚Äôll go back with something along the lines of‚Äù I know Marcus somethings not right it‚Äôs not just football‚Äù which fine that can be true he‚Äôll never actually address the on pitch stuff .\n\nHe shouldn't be commentating on Utd games either. He over-corrects while trying to be impartial. Any half-decent little spell the other team has, and suddenly they're prime Barcelona and \"only one team is going to score here\". Calm down Gary, that one shot Forest had that just went wide was only okay. \nSame with any refs call that's questioned. He always sides with the other team. \nThere's plenty of real stuff to criticise them for without making up additional nonsense. I'd honestly rather have Carragher on commentary.\n\n+arsenal\n\nNah I fucking love him and Carra, I was really hoping they'd become the next mainstays in football commentary\n\ni'm genuinely in disbelief anyone could feel like this about nevilles commentating\n\nHahahaha I do understand why folk don't like him, I can't help it\n\nTo be fair the play-by-play commentator is supposed to be telling you what's happening in the game. Not Gary Neville. There's an argument for whether or not we need a colour commentator for the football though. Never used to be. People like Motty used to do it on their own for decades. Now apparently we need ex pros who couldn't hack it as coaches telling us that a shit shot was a poor effort.\n\nI actually quite like Gary Neville. On the whole.\n\nHe comes across as very depressed\n\nYou can see what‚Äôs happening in the game\n\nCan I get a summary? I don't want their cookies and I don't want to pay them. Thanks\n\nGary Neville is stepping back from his hosting duties on Sky Sports' \"Monday Night Football\" (MNF) to focus on new projects in the U.S., including \"The Overlap US\" and his role on NBC Sports' Premier League coverage. Neville, who joined MNF as a match analyst in 2011 and later became a presenter alongside Jamie Carragher, has not appeared on the show since mid-August. While he may still make occasional appearances, Carragher will primarily lead the program going forward.\n\nNeville remains a key figure at Sky, continuing to feature in other shows like \"Friday Night Football\" and \"Super Sunday.\" He is also set to work from NBC's New York studio for a few weekends this season, ensuring his presence for U.S. audiences without overlapping major Premier League matches.\n\nDoesn't sound that different to how it already is then, Neville already did way less MNF than Carragher so I would say Carragher was already leading the program\n\nSounds like he's trying to dodge all the shit he's going to get for his pre-season predictions at the end of the year.\n\nGood, Carragher is way better at analysis anyways.\n\nAgreed as a Utd fan\n\nYanks can have him full-time.\n\nenter carpenter saw birds jeans toothbrush engine aromatic squeamish scarce\n\n *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev/home)*\n\nI thought you got James back? Perhaps we can agree on a ‚Äúone in, one out‚Äù rule? Should work.\n\nadvise toy different tease squash lock profit public brave nail\n\n *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev/home)*\n\nNew Christmas special so he'll be all over TV in December\n\nterrific intelligent unique hurry six sloppy bedroom person flag party\n\n *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev/home)*\n\nHis main gig seems to be a podcast for SiriusXM which is American but he might now be living back in London as he was doing theatre here in the summer saved he's writing a new Gavin &amp; Stacey. I guess he's having what Gary Neville might call a medium retirement, made enough money on the Late Late Show.\n\nDon‚Äôt want him on NBC unless he‚Äôs replacing Tim Howard. The two Robbie‚Äôs (Earle &amp; Mustoe) are as good as anyone else.\n\nI never get why US broadcasts always hire so many British pundits and commentators.\n\nWhat a cancerous website\n\nAll the Uk newspapers seem to do this now, its such a scummy move \"Either give us money or let us track you\"\n\nHe gets to make more money on his own projects and I don't have to see him on my football coverage. Talk about a win/win.\n\nIs Neville widely seen now as a bad pundit? \n\nI appreciate he talks about Man Utd too often (im not a Man Utd fan), but i feel like his analysis is generally quite fair and unbiased? \n\nHe‚Äôs been central to the panel for a good 10 years at least now, so i can see why people might want something a bit different, but i wasnt aware there was such negative feeling towards him. Definitely didnt used to be that way\n\nMaybe not bad but easily regressed into the lazy and comfortable for the most part. Understandable enough given you have to be able to follow the narrative for Sky and give them talking points to continue through the week.\n\nHe's been getting a lot of hate lately and rightly so. Basically, all the pundits on Sky are different levels of bad, because they're told what to say, never to criticise the ref, protect the brand and give soundbites that can go viral.\n\nYou telling me there‚Äôs a Vince McMahon yelling in their headsets??\n\nMostly no, they simply know there's a huge queue of ex-footballers coming for their jobs if they don't toe the party line. It was however confirmed that Neville and Carragher should defend the Newcastle-arsenal ghost goal (the one that crossed the sideline etc). Also, Carragher put up and quickly took down a tweet just last week about Howard Webb - pretty sure he got w stern message from the higher ups about his \"role\".\n\nFair point. I do agree with this, but i dont think this is a Neville thing, its a Sky thing\n\nPartly, but he's gone out of his way to make a fool of himself. Loved watching him squirm when confronted by Ian Hislop about him taking the Qatar blood money.\n\nAs a Canadian, whenever I can hear Gary Neville speak I've always found his insights quite good. I don't understand and agree with the hate he gets.\n\nHe was really good originally when they started actually talking about tactical setups and whatnot on mnf.¬†\n\n\nBut I think on that he's just so ridiculous when it comes to Man U and Liverpool (he didn't put Liverpool in his top 6 I don't think - the whole studio was clearly like wtf).¬†\n\n\nHe's never been a good commentator I don't think¬†\n\nHe just can‚Äôt take off his fan hat for that, can he? \n\nHis petulant responses after Liverpool schooled them earlier in the season were embarrassing. \n\nThe shark was jumped by him, and Keane to an extent, when they refused to be honest about what a poor job their mate Ole was doing. Both went in much harder on Jose and LVG.\n\nHe's just far too sure of himself. A lot of the best thinkers have strong ideas, but they hold them weakly and challenge their own perspectives completely.¬† ¬†\n\n\nFor example he got so wedded to the idea that Man Utd's midfield of Casemiro, Mainoo and Fernandes was far superior than Liverpool's 3 of Mac Allister, Gravenberch and Szoboszlai that during that game he was trying to scrabble for other reasons why Liverpool were dominating in the middle.¬† ¬†\n\n\nHe made his name as a pundit on solid video analysis which realistically was probably not done on his own. When he has to voice his own opinions in real time he's just confidently wrong far too often.¬†\n\nI think it‚Äôs a bit of a curse. You can only really be insightful to the average watcher for a brief period.\n\nYou say things that a person wasn‚Äôt aware of previously, they take them on board and then you keep saying the same things that made you popular in the first place and only someone who hasn‚Äôt heard it before can be entertained.\n\n4 or 5 years (especially when you‚Äôre on constantly) must be the absolute max before everyone is a bit tired of it.\n\nHe's incredibly annoying\n\nI think ask any Liverpool or Arsenal fan about this \"unbiased\" claim.  He's genuinely just a miserable experience for us to listen to.\n\nIts strange how people see and hear different things from each other, because ive genuinely never thought he's been particularly biased. I can recall countless times that he praised Liverpools team under Klopp, and the same for Arsenal under Arteta, when they started to be able to \"win ugly\". Not to mention the way he fauns over Man City (which tbh ive grown tired of if im honest).\n\nIf by biased you mean him celebrating Man Utd goals, and not being too enthusiastic about Liverpool or Arsenal goals then yeah maybe he is, but at the end of the day hes a lifelong Man Utd fan and hes a human being with emotions.\n\nWatch him commentate a Chelsea game and then see how fair or unbiased you think he is.\n\nIve watched loads of Chelsea games and genuinely never got that impression. \n\nIf its because hes calling you out for being shit id argue that thats not biased, its just fair analysis (over the last few years).\n\nTo be clear im a complete neutral in this, i dont support a prem club and dont like any of the top 6 (especially Man Utd).\n\nI mean one example, and probably one of the most viewed was his \"assessment\" of Chelsea being \"Blue billion pound bottle jobs\" after losing a closely contested game to Liverpool. \n\nOr him and Carra repeatedly going on and on about how Chelsea have 50 players in the locker room and that they should stop buying players despite Maresca stating publicly the squad size was 25 players or something.\n\nBut can you not see how both of those things are at least partly fair assessments of the club over the last few years? Under Abramovich you used to spend money, of course, but you used to win things. If you look at the way the club has been managed over the past 5 or so years, i dont see those comments as being biased at all tbh\n\n&gt; But can you not see how both of those things are at least partly fair assessments of the club over the last few years? Under Abramovich you used to spend money, of course, but you used to win things.\n\nNo, I don't think they're fair at all because there was no expectation to win things during that period. Everyone who had half a brain completely understood that they were rebuilding and that their purchases were an eye for the future, as well as all the behind-the-scenes restructuring of staff, wage bills and club connections etc.\n\nThere was no expectation to win anything despite spending north of a billion quid? Must be nice\n\nWhy quote half the paragraph and try to quip about something I didn‚Äôt say? \n\nThere was no expectation to win **during that period**. \n\nWhy? Because they were massively overhauling the team and understood it was a process that would take a while and the talent that they acquired were young players with high potential.\n\nUtter codswallop\n\nThe problem is not his lack of fairness, or his bias. The problem is he has no clue about the game.\n\nHas he said something to annoy you or something? He clearly doesnt have no clue about the game, he played it at the highest level for 20 years and has analysed and commented on it for another 10-15 years.\n\nIm not expecting you to like him but at least give a reason that makes sense if you dont\n\nI actually agree that his knowledge of the game seems poor.  Clearly in some ways his knowledge is vastly superior to mine, but when it comes to modern tactics and strategy in the game I just don't think he has much a mind for it.  \n\nI think Carra is actually at a similar level of knowledge, he's just a little more entertaining to me and I think he has slightly better insight.  Just because they were players doesn't mean they are  magically able to commentate on the modern game.  Players need to execute a plan, they don't need to explain it or analyze from the outside.\n\nYeah good point. I fully admit there are better tactical analysers out there, i just think its a bit much to say Neville knows nothing about the game\n\nYeah that is also fair\n\nI can‚Äôt remember the last time he offered any decent insight. It‚Äôs clear he doesn‚Äôt watch football anymore outside of the games he commentates on or has a vested interest in (Salford). All his analysis is stemmed around him trying to force his thoughts as an owner in. He joined Sky at a time where the dinosaurs were being phased out and he‚Äôs quickly becoming one.\n\nYou watch Carragher‚Äôs analysis of the man marking failure that led to Liverpool‚Äôs second on Sunday and it‚Äôs night and day from anything Neville has done in years\n\nHe has very little idea of what he's talking about, for starters. He's also incredibly biased (not sure where you pulled him not being biased out from) when commentating on Arsenal &amp; Liverpool games.\n\nCan we get Carragher something to do now as well. Sick of the fake jousting between these two. Also give us a Roy and Ian holiday program during the summer. It will help bring the cricket related suicide rate down at the very least.\n\nGod, please yes. Can't stand him and his stupid opinions and his ridiculous voice, it's like nails on a chalkboard.\n\nCarra is a decent pundit at least.\n\nHe's a walking football encyclopedia. Shame he also seems to be a prick...\n\nI think he's shite as well\n\n[deleted]\n\nI have *some -* minimal - sympathy for that. he didn't know there was a little girl; the guy was deliberately riling him up and filming him; it was just after a very emotional game. \n\nstill incredibly stupid behaviour, but I can see a lot of people acting in the same way under similar circumstances, especially given that he clearly didn't know there was a girl in the back.\n\n[deleted]\n\nI mean I don‚Äôt personally have any sympathy for him either but I do find it funny when people like you make out that he was on purpose spitting at a little kid when that obviously wasn‚Äôt actually what happened.\n\nStill disgusting and stupid but he‚Äôs not actively out there spitting on children lmao\n\nNonsense. Season after season he claims Liverpool are gonna win everything. Always shocked he got no stick for going to Sun Group companies the second he retired, but he‚Äôs certainly tried to make up for it by being a myopic cheerleader¬†\n\nLol, he is one of the most negative pundits when it comes to Liverpool. I don't know what you are listening to l.\n\nExactly lmao he does nothing but talk bad about liverpool ü§£ unless we win something\n\nAs long as Liverpool aren't involved, or any of their rivals. Listening to a Liverpool game with him on commentary is genuinely wors3 than fanzine used to be\n\nHe wants to focus on his management career and creating click bait / hot takes\n\nGot my hopes up but seems he will still do some commentary.\n\nGood. He is so bloody tiresome.\n\nAwful pundit\n\nGreat news, can't stand him on Sky Sports.\n\nHe‚Äôs an insufferable c*nt anyway. Let him go play businessman for awhile, his hotel was losing money last time I checked. \n\nFor someone who calls themselves a football analyst he doesn‚Äôt know more than the average Joe on the street. Pathetic journalism.\n\nImagine hating a random bloke this much\n\nImagine sticking up for a random bloke who doesn‚Äôt know you exist\n\nIm thinking you intended this to be edgy, but it sounds more like a compliment\n\nNot a ‚Äòrandom bloke‚Äô. Someone we‚Äôre forced to listen to in order to watch the game we love\n\nThe average Joe can barely form a coherent tactical argument, bet you can barely kick a ball also\n\nNeville can hardly form a coherent sentence. He starts mumbling like a fool when he tries to debate anything.\n\nPersonally, I still see it as him taking a retirement off.¬†\n\nFantastic news.\n\nAwful pundit\n\nHopefully Carragher goes next\n\ntease memorize workable melodic bored swim ask normal forgetful birds\n\n *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev/home)*\n\nBest news ever\n\nNo one wants to see him NBC either ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\n\nGood. the less I hear from Neville the better. Please step back from comms too\n\nI listened to this podcast yesterday. He said every three years he will take a step back and reevaluate what he‚Äôs doing, and then challenge himself to do something different. For example the last 3 years he‚Äôs been opting to do more long form conversational work hence things like The Overlap, and Stick To Football.\n\nNeeds a freshen up and do less work in general. Enjoy life for a bit.\nThen before he comes back into punditry go and consult at a club or two. Time flies fast and he and Keane maybe even Rooney might not be up to speed\n\nDoes he need it any more ? More money abroad his own show , and no more everyone tweeting about every word he says\n\nAt last\n\nI think he‚Äôs the best pundit\n\nThe worst thing about this article is Jamie Carragher isn't going anywhere.\n\nSeriously, I feel sorry for the American PL fans. Now they have to listen to the self-proclaimed Premier Minister of Football üòÅ\n\nI wish da fuck he can take a step back from commentating on the Liverpool matches.\n\nI hope he fucks off for good. I go to the pub to watch LFC every match. I've got my beer got my snacks then Gary fucking dickhead Neville starts commentating!!! LFC does not need you Gary! Fuck off\n\nIs it Christmas already?\n\nGood riddance, honestly.\n\nBiased tw@\n\nCan‚Äôt stand him\n\nExploring science behind dunking custard creams.\n\nThank god, he's a knob.\n\nGood riddance\n\nPlease take Jamie with you, he‚Äôs awful\n\nShould take Carragher with him.\n\nFuck sake I know a lot hate him but he‚Äôs genuinely in my eyes entertaining, when him and Carra are on together regardless of what you think of there analysis which iv thought was ok there are great to watch . Iv not watched MNF since they was the regulars on it I watch the game then switch off\n\nSome good news for once. Just need Carragher to follow\n\nGood news, hope the greedy rat will not come back.\n\nOh no! Anyway\n\nIs the reason ' Im a miserable biased derisory little man'\n\nHe hasn't been a regular on MNF for at least a year\n\nThe same Gary Neville that predicted that Arsenal would win the league and Villa wouldn't even make Europa Conference league? That Gary Neville?\n\nGreat, we will be continuously subjected to the guy who got a promotion after spitting in the face of a young girl\n\nAny wonder sky are reporting huge losses\n\nWhat? He‚Äôs the best and most knowledgeable pundit there is.\n\nCarragher is dumb as hell.\n\nNah if you think that then I‚Äôm guessing you know little about football.\n\nIf you think carragher is intelligent, then only god can save you.\n\nThere are a lot of pundits who are probably thick as shit, as people - but have excellent knowledge of the game\n\nI can't speak for Carragher's other knowledge, but the man knows football.\n\nI can however speak for Clinton Morrison, I heard from family members that he really isn't the smartest fella outside of punditry ü§£\n\nIn terms of football he is. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with his analysis and his knowledge of football history is the best I‚Äôve seen on the TV.\n\nHe's biased as fuck. Hate the guy cos I'm also biased as fuck but if you can't see his bias then we can't help you\n\nWhat‚Äôs that got to do with what I said? He‚Äôs still got the the best football knowledge on Sky.\n\nHe's a Liverpool legend and praises and understands everton so not really\n\nNot sure my argument was anything to do with his football intelligence or knowledge\n\nWell that‚Äôs all I care about as I‚Äôm watching for his football insight. He could be a complete prick to be around, but that has no affect on me so why would I care?\n\nHe's an insufferable nonce."

    "all_comment_text": "Swedish football is generally pretty bad, with the only bright spot being the atmosphere at the games, so voting against a measure that takes the joy out of every goal is pretty much on par for the course\n\nIf swedish football fams knew how to read they would be very upset with you right now!  \n  \nNo but honestly; The fans are prolly top 3 in the world. No kodding.\n\nApart from the top 5 teams it‚Äôs really low quality. But fans make the league insanely good to watch live.\n\nVAR is not the problem.\nThe idiots using it are.\n\nMake it a completely independent 3rd Party Run process.\n\nThe moment VAR stops being run by other referees that instead of doing their job they just want to protect the refs on the pitch then you would have a better system. There are so many easy calls that they just mess up that just shouldn't be a thing.\n\nI do agree but i feel the more pressing issue is to just simply mic the refs like they do in almost all other sports of the same popularity.\n\nToday var helped overturn a goal the ref allowed from real sociedad because Touchameni was fouled right before the goal. It‚Äôs just incompetent refs\n\nIts not a \"problem\" but I can see why a country might prefer not to use it because of things inherent in it like not having instantaneous decisions on the field\n\nYou still think VAR isn't a \"problem\" after the Euros ?\n\nNope. The very concept of VAR ruins the elation of scoring a goal, which is football‚Äôs USP.\n\nA job for AI\n\nSmith or Shearer?\n\nNah, VAR is the problem, it goes against the spirit of the game.\n\nI don‚Äôt know why var is so difficult for these leagues to use right.  In American football the only complaints instant replay gets are that it slows down the game.\n\nAmerican Football already takes 3.5 hours to get through 12 minutes of game play, who wants it to go even slower.\n\nAmerican football is a slow game in general.  I‚Äôm just saying that is the only complaint because it actually gets calls right and fixes missed calls, which the people using var seem to struggle with.\n\nVAR needs to be able to look at calls on the fly, American football officials have time to go to the screen, watch an episode or two of the Simpsons on it, buy a hot dog and eat said hot dog while watching the play, before play starts again.\n\nThat is absolutely false. We are constantly debating ‚Äúwhat is catch?‚Äù\n\nThose happen every once in a while, var fucks something up every week\n\nI whole heartedly disagree with you. The main difference is that American football doesn‚Äôt review penalties like holding or pass interference. Possession of the ball before hitting the ground or going out of bounds is the most debated. But even where a ball is spotted can be super controversial (for an extremely controversial example see Jesse James‚Äô ‚Äúnon touchdown‚Äù a few years ago). \n\nReplay and controversial calls are, in at least one game a week, the main topic of discussion for that game.\n\nLengthy stoppages are already built into American football, and the review mechanism is totally different.\n\nAnd only used for obvious ref mistakes. Giving offside after 5 mins deliberation for a 5mm offence is ridiculous and is ruining the game imo. And obviously unintentional handballs. So bad.\n\nYou think having control over the outcome of games in the most popular sport can ever be completley impartial? Its corrupt in and of itself, its absolute power and we pretend its somehow fair\n\nNo VAR is awful and only people who've never been to a game think it's good üëç\n\nMy argument has two points:\n\nIt alienates people in the ground because they've no clue what's going on and;\n\nYou can no longer celebrate goals because 9/10 goals have a VAR check.\n\nVAR can get in the bin with the dictatorships and hedge funds.\n\nAs a season ticket holder I agree with you.\n\nI‚Äôve only ever seen it work well for serious foul play; ref misses a clear and obvious foul that should be a red card.\n\nFor offsides and handballs and such it ruins the flow of the game and you do feel you can‚Äôt celebrate goals. I‚Äôd like to see it removed in my country.\n\n&gt;It alienates people in the ground because they've no clue what's going on and;\n\n\nIsn't this a licencing issue? You should be able to show the review on the screen. Additionally, I think we should be able to hear the referees discussing. None of this is inherently a VAR issue. \n\n&gt;You can no longer celebrate goals because 9/10 goals have a VAR check.\n\nI'd rather have to wait a bit to know if a goal's a goal than to have the team I like have totally obvious offside goals go in.\n\nFirstly, my club doesn't even have a screen and even if it did I'm sure the refs decided like the cowards they are not to show replays of decisions at grounds so as not to incense the crowds.\n\nSecondly yeah, I bet you would mate because you're watching on telly and have no stake in either team. You're not emotionally involved.\n\n&gt;Firstly, my club doesn't even have a screen and even if it did I'm sure the refs decided like the cowards they are not to show replays of decisions at grounds so as not to incense the crowds\n\nWhat PL ground doesn't have a screen? Couldn't they just put one up. \n\n&gt;Secondly yeah, I bet you would mate because you're watching on telly and have no stake in either team. You're not emotionally involved.\n\nLol\n\n&gt; What PL ground doesn't have a screen? Couldn't they just put one up. \n\nWho said anything about the fucking Premier League? This is a thread about *Swedish* football. Believe it or not, screens cost a bit of money for a number of clubs and linking a screen on the ground to the VAR system is a fucking mental idea. Can you imagine what will happen in the grounds if one of those blatantly wrong VAR decisions is accompanied by action replays of the footage showing how biased/corrupt/incompetent the referees are? It'd be carnage.\n\nmy main argument against is:              \nthat it is fucking stupid that a multi billion sport is dictated by the old farts based based purely on their feel and biases. its fucking moronic.      \nI can celebrate goals just as i did before as now i am 90% correct if the goal will stand or not as i watch the game. And if i think its close to offside or sth like that i postpone my celebration a bit. Who cares if its not straight away, much better than to lose an important game because of the refs vibes.               \nSo yeah for me the only thing that goes against VAR is how they are using it. And i think its by the design of these old farts that want to still feel important on the pitch and its brusing their ego\n\nNonsense, once the moment is gone you can't get it back.\n\n&gt;You can no longer celebrate goals because 9/10 goals have a VAR check.\n\nOf course you can, it just might end up being ruled out. Same as when you celebrate for a minute, then notice the lino has got their flag up.\n\n&gt; Of course you can, it just might end up being ruled out\n\nIt's not a question of whether *logically* you still can celebrate. The problem is *emotionally* it becomes difficult because you're worried about getting hurt. \n\nTake the FA cup semi final. The transition Coventry fans went through from pure ecstasy to realising the goal was disallowed is incredibly painful.\n\nBut they would have had the same painful experience if the lino had put their flag up. VAR isn't the issue, its the way it's implemented, the quality of the officials and the officials not wanting to overturn their mates' decisions.\n\nThe flag going up takes about 5 seconds and the audience def notices in that time and so does the commentator, you really cant compare that to VAR which takes many times longer.\n\nThereve been VAR checks that pulled back a goal even after the final whistle.\n\nYou can def prefer the game with VAR but its dishonest pretending its like the linesman.\n\nLmao are you being serious? That's the most childish 21st century reason I've heard. \"It's bad cuz it might hurt your fee fees and thats bad cuz it can make you sad!\"\n\nYou don't get football\n\nYou don't get a fair competition\n\nNo pal, as I've said elsewhere fans used to often look at the linesman to see if their flag went up. Some people would leap around for a split second but I always checked the linesman first. That way I was ENGAGED as a fan because decisions played out in front of me real-time.\n\nAnd that's just offsides. A ref might indicate a foul or handball but again the fans would be ENGAGED because the decision would be nearly instantaneous whether right or wrong.\n\nI've definitely been celebrating for over a minute inside the ground before I've realised its offside.\n\nI agree VAR takes too long, but automatic offsides and letting the VAR official actually make decisions instead of making the ref run over to a screen to have a look would massively reduce the time it takes.\n\nThen you're an idiot\n\nThanks for the insult.\n\nThis is the worst decison for against it\n\nYou can still celebrate goals üòÜ \n\nSuch a strawman argument\n\nYou can, just runs the risk your goal will be cancelled out after youre done celebrating\n\nIf your emotional state is that fragile then you shouldn't be watching football anyway.\n\nI don't believe you have ever been to match. The fun is being lost in the moment, not watching some cunt stand there for 5 minutes with his finger in his ear.\n\nI have been to hundreds of games around the world and I believe it was a great addition.\n\nIs this rage bait\n\nNo...\n\nI dunno about that man. There are ways of implementing it well. Rugby manages just fine.\n\nI know rugby fans who don't like it, but at least in rugby the fans are integrated and know what's going on.\n\nAlso completely different sport, football is built almost entirely on that euphoria, other sports can be more high scoring and have less of those moments.\n\nRugby is a game that constantly stops and they take minutes over every single try because the ref is too scared to actually make a decision.\n\n....he's stopping it to make sure it's the right decision....?\n\nNah, all these professional referees who worked for years to get to their position doing high-pressure games and coming up as the best in their class are actually all just big jessies, it turns out.\n\nI say this all the time and get loads of shit from it, I‚Äôm 100% certain those who don‚Äôt like VAR hardly if ever go to games.\n\nWhat a load of nonsense. VAR only exists for TV audiences,hardly anyone who attends a match thinks it's a good idea.\n\nAh, I‚Äôm an idiot(/pissed up). I meant those that LIKE VAR hardly if ever go to games. Im in staunch opposition to it and always have been.\n\nAgreed. That makes more sense and I'm in total agreement\n\nFuck it then, let's keep letting the game be badly officiated and have games &amp; championships decided by those mistakes. Sounds reasonable.\n\nYeah fuck it let's just do VAR where it's absolutely fucking shit officiating but with loads of extra steps.\n\nAt least VAR presents an opportunity to fix that issue, unlike the braindead idea to just leave things as they are.\n\nVAR is as bad officiating (do you even watch the prem?) but with added delay\n\nVAR exists in other leagues outside the PL, their specifically bad implementation of it does not make VAR itself bad. The PL's rules are written specifically to neuter VAR and make it as inefficient as possible.\n\nRight‚Ä¶ so the best solution would still be to get rid of VAR, if the prem don‚Äôt want to use it properly. I‚Äôm a leeds fan and this season has been way better because I can celebrate goals properly without wondering whether it‚Äôs getting chalked off after a 5 minutes.\n\nNo because even with the PL's implementation it still catches a tonne of goals that shouldn't have stood or fouls that should have been punished. Removing it would do more harm than good and it can be continually improved upon going forwards at least.\n\nThe issues you've stated are still problems with the users not the tech itself though.\n\n90% of decisions could easily be made within a few seconds and others 30 seconds MAX. The people behind the screen are the ones delaying the decisions. They could literally automate the majority of it and it would be fast and accurate but they are desperate to continue rimming referees and officials for some reason\n\nA linesman's flag goes up in less than a second. 30 seconds is still 29.2 seconds too long and a few seconds is still 2.2 seconds too long.\n\nIt was better before, only people who watch the Premier League from countries where the games kick off at 3am think otherwise.\n\nYes but linesmen get it wrong which is the entire purpose of VAR. You have to understand what is at stake with every decision. To you its just football, you wanna see thr game flow but you don't care about every person and outcome that is affected by poor decisions on the field. VAR is absolutely necessary. The officials behind the screens aren't.\n\n\nVAR is here to stay they will never remove it so\n\nMate everyone used to get bad decisions against them. All this VAR shit has done is make us question the integrity of the game even more!\n\n[deleted]\n\nAnother sherlock . It was exponentially much easier to rig the games before . Do I have to point out this ?!\n\nWhen VAR was first mooted I thought it would be to prevent absolute clangers by the referee - someone blatantly stood in an offside position, an Henry style handball goal. I thought it would be used in very rare occasions and it wouldn‚Äôt disrupt the flow of games.\n\nInstead it‚Äôs used to measure offsides by millimetres and for ‚Äòfouls‚Äô that no one appealed for or even noticed. I want VAR, but I want a VAR that prevents genuine miscarriages of justice, not one that saps the absolute joy out of the game through pedantic officiating.\n\nShould be a time limit on decisions, and all reviews should be in real time. No slow motion, just multiple angles.\n\nSemi-automatic offsides should fix that line drawing\n\nIt follows the rules of the game. If you want that the rules need changjng\n\nIs it not the application of VAR rather than changing the rules of the game?\n\nOffside is offside. If you have the tech to spot it. Why would they ignore it. Also who call blatant errors\n\nThe whole reason offside was brought in was to prevent goal hanging/unfair advantage. It‚Äôs just added an element of pedantry that‚Äôs removed a lot of enjoyment from the game. If it takes drawing lines/measuring by millimetres then it‚Äôs hard to argue that someone has gained an unfair advantage. \n\nIf the Coventry goal hadn‚Äôt been overturned would that have been a blatant error? I‚Äôd argue the advantage wasn‚Äôt because his boots were a millimetre ahead of the defenders, the advantage was from the defenders poor positioning.\n\nYou're missing the point, and this is the issue. You can't go against the rules because of vibes. \n\nEven though its no advantage. Its what the rules say. The rules need changing.\n\nThere are offside traps and such. Yeah unfortunately its any goal scoring body parts. \n\nPeople really need to read what the offide rule is\n\nI know what the rule currently says - but since tech has been introduced it‚Äôs made the application of that rule an absolute which is sapping enjoyment out of the game.\n\nI‚Äôm sure the rules used to allow for daylight/gave advantage to the attacking team. I‚Äôd rather change the rules to eliminate extended delays where there is no evident unfair advantage gained.\n\n&gt;since tech has been introduced it‚Äôs made the application of that rule an absolute\n\nIt was already an absolute, but sometimes the wrong decision was made.\n\n&gt;I‚Äôm sure the rules used to allow for daylight/gave advantage to the attacking team.\n\nThey did, and there's a possibility that we'll go back to that. But don't forget that even if you move the line, there's still going to be a line.\n\nIt was always an absolute, you‚Äôre right - but not one that would sometimes take 4-5 minutes to decide. If it takes minutes/the drawing of lines to determine I‚Äôd rather that be judged to be level.\n\nTotally, there's always a line. It's not by giving x centimeters of margin that things will change.\n\nHard disagree. One of the unique aspects of football refereeing is that their primary role is in fact to protect the spirit and ‚Äúvibes‚Äù of the game as opposed to strictly enforcing rules. That‚Äôs what the fans want too and that‚Äôs what this whole debate is about. Rules should be applied according to the spirit in which they were made. One could even argue that blown calls are a natural part of the game and VAR should only be used to correct the most egregious and impactful mistakes.\n\nUnfortunately there is a lot of money in play here.\n\nWe must follow rules for fair play and to filter out fraude\n\nImperfect officiating is not at all comparable to fraud. And as VAR proves, there is no amount of technology that can guarantee perfectly fair or equal application of the rules.\n\nsteep crush pet ludicrous compare whole lush shaggy vanish rotten\n\n *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev)*\n\nI'm for it, but for semi automated offsides only, VAR has really ruined the match day experience for me, the constant, long checks for every situation ruining the flow and I cant even celebrate a goal properly anymore, as I instantly know to hold off because there's a good chance a 5 minute review is on the way\n\nIf you think this then your team hasnt experienced enough.\n\nMy team for example couldnt play the 2018 ucl final because of an handball, so i want Var\n\nMy team lost the 2019 ucl final because of a false handball penalty and the VAR didn't overturn it so I don't want VAR\n\nCant remember exactly what match that was. Which team / match was it?\n\nRoma-Liverpool 4-2 with Trent playing goalkeeper.\n\nThat Ucl was also infamous for Bayern getting robbed in the quarters.\n\nThat against Real Madrid right?\n\nYeah\n\nOr, hear me out this is a real wild theory but, just maybe, there's good AND bad reasons on both sides of the argument and neither side is \"right\"? I know I know asking for nuance on reddit is like going to a Brazilian football match and shouting obscenities at both teams you're right just forget what I said\n\nHow can anyone really argue against VAR? The pros out weight the cons by a lot. If it takes 5 mins to review a call so be it. I rather have that than have a uncalled penalty or worse a wrongfully annulled goal that can decide whether a team advances to a final or loses a final.\n\nThere have been plenty of ridiculous calls (and non-calls) with VAR. There's a new VAR fuck up seemingly every week.\n\nIts central claim is that it will remove controversy from refereeing decisions. It very obviously hasn't done that. All it has succeeded in doing is make the controversies more tedious than ever.\n\nFor every fuck up VAR has done 10 non-VAR fuck up happen. I rather take my odds with VAR.\n\nI'd agree that VAR has had a positive impact on the overall percentage of correct decisions. However I'm dreading playing under VAR if Ipswich go up to the prem. It just sucks up so much atmosphere - I'd rather take the 50/50 of on field decisions that than wait around for checks.\n\nThere's also the fact that even with VAR there's a lot of problematic decisions. I'd like to see:\n\n1. The \"clear and obvious\" criteria applied more strictly - especially in the context of handball decisions. \n2. A more sensible margin for error in offside decisions. The technology is a long way from perfect (frame rate of cameras, the exact placement of an attackers armpit, etc.)\n\nThere's a reason no one moans about goal line technology, it's quick, unobtrusive and accurate - I think VAR needs to strive to be closer to those aims.\n\nYeah you are right, its better i forget what you said\n\nThe rules around handball are particularly trash and VAR absolutely has not helped these one iota, except for increasing the amount of ridiculous handball penalties given.\n\nDo you think Trent handball, Henry or Maradona would've got a pass? Just think about it realistically.\n\nThe real enemy of today's football is money and foreign owners, not Var\n\nTotally agree with this - \"ball to hand\" while never a clearly defined rule was a well established practice in refereeing that made a lot of sense. VAR has stamped all over that discretion and meant players have to contort themselves into unnatural positions in defense to shield their arms from the ball\n\n&gt;I cant even celebrate a goal properly anymore\n\n\nI read this very often bit everytime im in the stadium the narrative collappses. Personally its not different to 10 years ago and the others around me also celebrate like nothing else. Only thing where its not a huge celebration is, when goal is scored but the ref instantly calls offside but after the check the goal is given. But without VAR there wouldnt have been a goal at all.\n\nWe saw how many people complained about no goal-line technology in laliga, it's going to be the same about var if it's gone\n\nExcept goal-line technology works.\n\nTho in the very rare cases it doesn't, it leads to big controversies.\n\nVAR could be perfect and instant. People would still complain. Football for some people is an outlet for frustration and you'll never please then\n\nVAR- it sucks the life out of the football. Football is a contact sport therefore in essence never perfect! But if it takes 8 minutes to work out that somebody is 1mm offside you can keep it. It‚Äôs designed for nothing more than to be controversial.\n\nToday I feel Swedish\n\njust wait until they start crying about being robbed, bad with VAR, worst without it\n\nSo theyre going to cry about not having something they never had and now voted against again.\n\nYea probably\n\nPretty sure Swedish football fans are against VAR. They never had VAR, so doubt they‚Äôre gonna cry about it.\n\nTeams are still being robbed with VAR lol which is even worse than being robbed without it. The season has recently started and there have been some questionable calls that fans have been made about but still no one is calling for VAR. Your shows how little you know about Swedish football culture.\n\nDisagree, before mistakes would happen but it was excusable in a lot of situations because of how fast things happen.\n\nVAR looks at it in freeze frame for 5 minutes and still gets it wrong, which is completely inexcusable and borderline corrupt.\n\nOh boy. The refs make stupid mistakes in every game in Sweden right now. I wish I was kidding.\n\nafter the first round of the brazilian league three refs were suspended, so I get you\n\nRubbish. VAR is the worse thing ever to happen to football.\n\nIf its so bad stop complaining when teams get wrong offside goals given or penalties for dives. You can't have it both way üíÄ\n\nI never complained before and I'm 62. I accepted it and moved on. Same as I do every Saturday at my beloved amateur league football. Tough, uncompromising, refs mistakes, no action replays and no prima donnas\n\nThat would be preferable\n\nHow do you know he's complaining about those things? You know what they say about making assumptions right? Don't make them because you're already a dick but now we all think you're an asshole too. Or something similar\n\nroof vanish shaggy waiting wrong pie plough threatening jeans bewildered\n\n *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev)*\n\nAnd don't be such a patronising prig.\n\nGame is back\n\nPeople here don't understand that it's not about mistakes in refereeing decisions but a disturbance of the game that makes people hate VAR.\n\nThat's a lie. We're now ignoring all the whining we did before VAR?\n\nno we hate VAR because its obvious on the video what happened to anyone but to the refs\n\nVar time is recovered . There's times 10 in time wasted through feigning injuries , wasting time by players and keepers that never gets recovered with large stoppages in play . Not to mention arguing with referees .\n\nNot just is VAR time most of the time, not recovered, but also does it really destroy the viewing experience if you are in a stadium and need to wait 2 minutes for penalty decision.\n\nIt doesn't . It's worse getting a penalty that wasn't . Or not getting one that was . Players would argue for two minutes anyway without var .\n\nPeople yelled for technology because the refs got it wrong. Technology comes in and the refs still get it wrong. \n\nAt some point we just have to admit there‚Äôs an element of chance and luck in the game and move on. \n\nI attend about 4 allsvenskan matches a year. VAR is at bottom of the issue list.\n\nBut they get it wrong less than they did before . Thsts the whole point . Plenty of idiots amongst referees that even with videos they fuck it up . But without video they fuck it up ten times more .\n\nGive it the tennis system. The coaches get to coal a VAR check like 2x per game and they get it back if its correct\n\nVAR is watching office politics and corporate decision making happening in real time. We already see it during the week, now we got to see it on the weekend.\n\ndoll voiceless sense office grab crown truck mysterious badge butter\n\n *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev)*\n\nDeath to VAR.\n\nI can understand. VAR hasn't done any good in other leagues.\n\nCome premier league do the right thing too.\n\nFuck VAR off everywhere. \n\nIt‚Äôs much more fun even if you celebrate instantly and realise the flag is up after a few seconds rather than wait for them to find a pube over a computer line for 5 minutes.\n\nOne of the last outposts for the beautiful game :)\n\nThey all watch the EPL, so they know‚Ä¶.\n\nMmmmm no lockdown no VAR.\n\nVAR is good in concept. The way it is being used needs some major overhaul. \n\nI‚Äôd start with no automatic VAR until last 10 minutes and in penalty time but have automatic VAR for all goals and penalty kicks. Then give each manager a challenge per half. They can challenge certain rules like out of bounds, penalties, free kicks, corners v goal kicks, possession, etc. during entire match. The challenge must be immediate. If the challenge is rejected they get no more. If successful they retain their challenge ability. \n\nVAR seems reluctant to override an official. They need to be more independent or there needs to be two VAR officials. If the two agree on mistake they overturn. If one sides with on field ref then they don‚Äôt. Yes, this is probably too expensive to do below 2nd level leagues or top leagues for small countries. \n\nLastly, more transparency in decision at match and review of all VAR calls by league officials. Do they already do that?\n\nVAR should either be run by AI or scrapped in my opinion. It's been proven, at least in the English Premier League, that it's open to all sorts of human manipulation. The technology itself is not the issue, it's the people using it.\n\nBring back traditional football !\n\nVAR may not be perfect, but try winning against Boca Jrs. at La Bombonera without it!\n\nBased\n\nSemiauto offside and goal line tech should be use like in the World Cup but that it\n\nI AM 100% ON-BOARD.....!\n\nBased Sweden\n\nIs there a Swedish league? Who cares\n\nFinally the swedes made a good decision\n\nVAR isn't the issue, it's just a tool. It's the people making the final refereeing decisions that give VAR a bad rep.\n\nNo, it really is VAR that‚Äôs the issue. \n\nThere is no way of operating VAR that makes the game as good a viewing experience as it was before its introduction.\n\nImagine if we as humanity said \"There is no way\" to every other problem that seemed impossible?\n\nIndeed. Thankfully though we usually have the good sense to find the way before implementing it.\n\nGood for them. Football is way better without VAR. Sure, some decisions go your way and others don't, but other the course of a season it evens itself out.\n\nThe simple joy that you can celebrate a goal as soon as it goes in, instead of waiting ages for VAR to look at it cannot be underestimated.\n\nfuck you, many times it doesn't.\n\nCome here and say it again the day your team loses a final after a gol offside.\n\nYes Sweden your fucking class. Others need to follow suit\n\nI‚Äôm going to sound like an absolute yank here but I think fifa should take inspiration from the NFL, MLB and NHL. Instead of var intervening in every eligible play , coaches should be allowed 1 or 2 challenges per game. That way we still have var, but it‚Äôll feel less intrusive. It‚Äôll also introduce a new strategical element to the game.\n\nVAR needs change, live decisions, ref mics and decisions made on the stadium screens, like rugby\n\n\"A Vote\".. when did anyone get to vote one this game killing tech? Fuck VAR its made no difference to the accuracy of decision and breaks the game up constantly. \n\nGet rid of VAR its totally failed and figure out an instant offside system.. leave the game alone FIFA\n\nIn Sweden we have the 51% rule, meaning that the fans control the clubs. We, the fans, have voted against VAR at the annual meeting of the club. Meaning that the clubs stance in any meetings with the FA involving VAR is against.\n\nWell done Sweden.\n\ncant imagine football without VAR\n\nLol what? Were you born yesterday? Cuz it's still pretty new\n\nyeah I know that it is new, but I cant take seriously the sport without VAR\n\nSounds like Sweden actually wants its league to retain its soul. Good for them.\n\nVoting against fair play then ?\n\nabsolute fucking kings - strong minded\n\nAre you guys getting paid to support VAR in here? VAR is not that amazing. I don‚Äôt like to wait 30 seconds to cheer for a goal. I love blaming the refs for bad results and love me football simple as.\n\nSwede here. As the fans are the majority holders of the clubs, it is our decision that determines the stance of the clubs in the VAR question. Any other decision from the FA would‚Äôve caused an outrage of biblical proportions. \n\nI firmly believe that VAR takes away the soul of the game in its current form. Football is all about emotions and momentum and this is lost when it takes several minutes to determine whether or not a play is good. It kills the game. \n\nJust a couple of weeks ago my team, Djurg√•rdens IF, was down 0-3 at home in the 86‚Äô minute. Out of nowhere it‚Äôs 2-3 in the 89‚Äôth. Everyone is screaming and the opposition is scared for their lives and suddenly can‚Äôt play football anymore despite outplaying us for the entire game. And then after a blocked shot in the penalty box, the entire stadium scream for handball (which it absolutely wasn‚Äôt), the referee thinks about it for a few seconds and awards it. \n\n3-3 in the 94‚Äôth and the only thing people are thinking about is scoring a 4th. \n\nOf course with VAR the penalty would never have been awarded and DIF would certainly not have made it 3-3. However, as a fan, I much rather take my fair share of wrong calls to be able to experience moments like that, the sheer madness in the stands with moms, children and elders alike screaming from the top of their lungs to get the ball into the net. VAR in its current form doesn‚Äôt allow that. \n\nI think VAR would work if they only reviewed clear breakage of the rules to protect the referees, but in the bulk of situations it would be down to the referee on the pitch to make the calls.\n\nW Sverige\n\nPeople who are celebrating should know that with VAR there would be less refree mistakes. What VAR does is makes it much easier for refs to make decisions, but refs are incompetent most of the times, which is why the story gets highlighted by media because they say how can you be wrong with the power of retrospection.\n\nBut if refs are incompetent, that means they'll make even more blatantly bad decision without any chance to review them.\n\nThis is not really a good decision from this aspect. However there's another aspect, the supporters can enjoy a goal given by ref, without thinking it can be reverted.\n\nIt‚Äôs a trade off. Better decisions at the cost of a less fluid game. IMO only goal line technology was implemented in a way that doesn‚Äôt make watching the sport more painful than it has to be. \n\nVAR also introduced a host of problems, where every small incident and technicality gets reviewed so teams are incentivized to fish for fouls.\n\nIMO the success criteria for VAR shouldn‚Äôt be just to increase the accuracy of decisions, but also to make the game more watchable.\n\nGame is full of stoppages . Takes more than a minute to take a free kick around the box, then feigning injuries , time wasting , arguing with referees .. Var wastes the least time and thst time is always recovered .\n\nThere is no reason for VAR audio not to be played live and for refs not to be mic‚Äôd up.\n\nOther than corrupt officials protecting each other obviously.\n\nThe problem is not VAR, not entirely at least; it's the fans that keep bitching about decisions because irrefutable evidence is not enough for some oddballs. VAR needs to improve, but saying VAR is bad for the game or not needed is a joke. The same people that hate VAR become appreciative when VAR saves their team. VAR will be the way to go, the fans just aren't ready for it.¬†They just need to minimize poor calls as much as humanly possible.\n\nThat's an absurd decision.\n\n[deleted]\n\nSometimes you buy the ref, sometimes they buy the ref, spmetimes the ref blinks\n\nVAR fixed the game but as always it won't fix the fans\n\nYeah‚Ä¶ because that‚Äôs what VAR should be catering towards, the supporters. Never mind the people playing the game. \n\nWhat a stupid response that is.\n\nI can‚Äôt imagine why any business would want to cater to what their customers want\n\nFootball is a sport. The clubs are a limited business. \n\nI didn‚Äôt think I would have ever needed to explain that to anyone but here we are.\n\nPeople go to watch football regardless of whether something like this is implemented or not. Because they support their team and like the competitive nature it brings.\n\nPeople buy tickets and subscriptions to watch football. For most clubs, barring the few that have giant international fanbases, this is what primarily drives their revenue and makes them able to function. People watch football matches because they like the product, it makes no sense for clubs and leagues to make changes that make the match day experience worse for fans, especially in leagues where fan attendance is the main driver of revenue.\n\nExactly ‚Äúpeople go to football matches because they like the sport‚Äù, so what difference does this make? üòÇ\n\nIt‚Äôs literally the same with any product and business in the world. If McDonald‚Äôs announce they‚Äôre going to put rats in the burgers, because ‚Äúpeople like burgers and will buy them anyway‚Äù, and their customers say ‚Äúplease do not do that‚Äù it would make no sense for McDonald‚Äôs to go ahead with it anyway. It‚Äôs an extreme example granted, but I don‚Äôt know how else to make it any clearer. I don‚Äôt get why you‚Äôre so opposed to businesses listening to their customers?\n\nThe moment you start comparing Football with McDonald‚Äôs.. I feel sorry for any team you support.\n\nüëç\n\nGive teams 3 uses of VAR a match, like in Tennis they can challenge 3 calls a set. Think the goal you conceded was offside? Ask VAR to check it, if you're wrong you have two challenges remaining\n\nAnother genius ..\n\nAnd the crowd goes mild...\n\nMmmmm no lockdown no VAR.\n\nMmmmm no lockdown no VAR."

    "all_comment_text": "Sometimes it is embarrassing being a Liverpool fan. Not because of the performance or the result, but because fellow fans go off with this stupid \"didn't want to win it anyway\" shite.\n\n\nWe did want to win it. We DO want to win it. We want to win every single game we play. It's fine to just say we weren't at the races last night and a good Atalanta side punished us.\n\nIt's the classic Mickey mouse cup cope, happens with all competitions that aren't the league or CL. Funniest thing is it always brought up when there's an upset if they won it would have been drummed up as a important win for more silverwares.\n\nIt extends to PL and CL too. \n\nThen it becomes ‚Äúoh we weren‚Äôt expected to compete at the start of the season / nobody expected us to get this far‚Äù and rinse and repeat.\n\nOof yep thats the excuse my own fellow arsenal fans were using last year, it was unbearable to hear the excuses rather then just accepting we sold at the end.\n\nI refuse to believe we have good chance to win the league, we always throw it away.\n\n2 games left and we are leading or level I will start hoping.\n\nI am just happy to be getting Champions league again.\n\nDoesn't help our run in looks really difficult as well but all we can do hope\n\nLol you are not arsenal fan. Clown, you are unbearable. Lpool bottled it,not arsenal\n\nI'm not twerking for upvotes but as an arsenal fan I do think we bottled it, no shame in it tho i think we can win it this year\n\nLmao how, we drew against Southampton and Westham in must win games and then threw away a 2-0 lead against Liverpool...u are delusional mateüíÄ\n\nYou got a bit of PTSD from the rinsing you got from your mates haven't you\n\nI also thought we were a bit arrogant in our assumption we‚Äôd be getting to the final, ticket quotas etc, it was like a boxer looking beyond their next opponent\n\nDon‚Äôt underestimate Atalanta. Lesson learned for Liverpool fans yesterday\n\nAlways it's hard to be a Dynamo Kyiv fan. I remember 3:0 and 4:0 against Barcelona. Dynamo can't win LNZ Cherkasy, now. When Valeriy Lobanovskyi died, Dynamo began to stagnate. When the full-scale war of Russia against Ukraine began, things got even worse in Ukrainian footballüò≠üò≠üò≠. I just want to see the same Dynamo! But every day i understand that we are further and further from what i want...\n\nUnlucky having to rely on a hapless Nunez and a fading Salah for a lot of the season...Jota, had he stayed fit would have converted tons of those chances that Liverpool have created in the last few months and would have had a hat-trick last night.\n\nI, as a Liverpool fan, freaking want us to win it because I'm still sad over the lost 2016 Final and I want Klopp to win the single title he hasn't won yet before leaving us. Although I have a soft spot for Atalanta, I'm mad over yesterday's result. That was shocking. Yes, we'd lost to them at home before, but not THIS way.\n\nKlopp shat the bed, remove Darwin and leave Gapko in the field, disgusting\n\nGakpo was Liverpool's best outfield player on the pitch last night.\n\nAtalanta is the most unique team in football. A sucking phalanx. Liverpool are used to EPL brainless and mindless muscle covered cyborgs. \n\nAtalanta can punish a lot of teams who don't expect it or lack experience of facing them\n\nthey got too cocky this game, subbing their most important players for youngsters that haven't fully hit puberty yet, this is a tragic defeat for J√ºrgen Klopp just before leaving his club.\n\nNow if some of your lot can stop the patronizing act on Arsenal all will be well. We might cock it up ourselves, as we've done before plenty of times, fingers crossed we don't.¬†\n\nWe all know the team do this on purpose to setup the comeback scenario. Everything is going according to plan.\n\n[deleted]\n\nThat was literally the strongest start XI he had fit\n\n He brought on salah, szob, Robbo, I get that some of them were coming back from injury but might have been better starting a stronger squad and subbing early if we tooo control of the tie\n\nDisagree. I think it was a strong 11, almost the strongest available (can dispute Salah but he's not 100%, same for Robbo).\n\n\nKlopp didn't disrespect Atalanta. That's a stupid thing to suggest. He's a professional and he knows any team can win if not given the right respect. You'd have to be as deluded as the fans I'm talking about in my own support to think like this.\n\n\nWe lost because Atalanta showed up with a game plan and more desire to win.\n\nA trophy is a trophy. If Liverpool didn‚Äôt want to win it they would have played their academy from the beginning. \n\nIf they‚Äôre such a big club in an inferior competition they should have no issues reaching the final.\n\nBarring a miracle that was Klopp‚Äôs last European game at Anfield.\nThey were dying to win it. They just played very poorly and Atalanta played very well.\n\nThe club did want to win it, it‚Äôs only certain fans claiming they didn‚Äôt. They just didn‚Äôt show up.\n\n[deleted]\n\nThe 6 times champions league winners?\n\nThis is a bad comment and you should feel bad.\n\nMaybe not so big....\nOnly confirms that Premier league, or Ingles clubs are not the best....\n\nExcept if you look at the coefficient rankings England is top for the full period and it isn‚Äôt even close/competitive. So simply put no, you‚Äôre very wrong. \n\nThe last five UCL finals were City vs Inter, Liverpool vs Madrid, Chelsea vs City, Bayern vs PSG and Liverpool vs Spurs, an English side in all but one and 6/10 finalists were English. 3/5 winners were English, all different teams.\n\nEngland has been top tier in recent years consistently, before that La Liga absolutely dominated relentlessly, albeit with less variety but with a crazy long stretch, they owned the 2010‚Äôs near enough.\n\nThat's not it. It's just that EL is not an easy competition to win. From QF on, if you don't bring your absolute best effort you will get stomped.\n\nLol, England has five clubs left in European cups, more than anyone\n\n[deleted]\n\nWell city and arsenal are still favourites. Idk about the rest but doesn't really matter, it's clearly the best league in the world lol\n\n[deleted]\n\nSo you think if you put the top three in Italy against Arsenal, Liverpool and City they're coming out on top? Lol, get real\n\n[deleted]\n\nWell one random Europa game doesn't change much lol. You could make a strong argument that the top three in England are the best in the world, let alone against Italy.\n\nInter was in the final last season because they played Porto, benfica and Milan on the way lol. I don't want too be too disrespectful, because Serie A used to be a great league, but if you put Aston Villa in there this year they would probably finish at least second\n\n[deleted]\n\nwhat a dream. to win the europa!!! lmao these articles bro\n\nnot much longer. I think England are third in coefficient rank.\n\nFor the singular year. Miles ahead for the full 5-year table though, which is a much better marker for discussing ‚Äúwhich league is best‚Äù.\n\nI wasn't debating what league ieague is the best. Ghat varies from year to year. All I know is that there'll be 5 Italian teams in the CL next year because theyre on top\n\nThe guy at the top of our chain was saying that, my comment was combining your context and his opinion. The actual coefficient ‚Äúrank‚Äù is done by the 5 yr table though which is why you‚Äôve probably been downvoted for saying ‚ÄúEngland are third‚Äù, as that‚Äôs only true for the singular period.\n\nYeah i wasn't arguing anything else than what I said.\n\nWhere'd you get this idea from\n\nThey were rotating for the most part weren‚Äôt they?\n\nI liked the bit when the fans rotated themselves out of the stadium before full time, great set of fans! üòÇ\n\nHappens at all clubs mate and I don‚Äôt even like Liverpool.. some fans need to beat traffic, some would rather be in the pub than watch last 10 minutes of a game that‚Äôs already done. If you actually bothered your arse to attend matches rather than be a keyboard warrior you‚Äôd know that‚Äôs common practice up and down the country\n\nAs someone else pointed out this was Klopps last European game at anfield potentially.. good of them fans to stay on &amp; give him a decent send off.\n\nI do both. üôÇ was at Old Trafford 3 weeks ago for the everton game.\n\nVanDiJk, Salah, McAllister, Diaz, Jota, Nunez, Robertson, Konate, gakpo all played last night. \n\nThat‚Äôs 9 first team players in a comp you don‚Äôt claim to care about. \n\nChatting all season about winning a quadruple &amp; you‚Äôre gonna finish with a league cup! üòÇ\n\nSala, Diaz, and Jota were brought on. Several of the others were just really off form. \n\n\n\nIt‚Äôs also rather hypocritical to see a man u fan take the piss out of a title competing team.\n\nOh aren‚Äôt you competing for a quadruple anymore? üòÇ\n\nYeah I said they all played which was true.\n\nComing out of 22/23 we had just had one of our worst seasons under Klopp, we didn‚Äôt even get top 4, our midfield was completely revamped.\n\n\nOf the top of my head this season we‚Äôve had 6 major injuries. \n\n\nWhose fault is that? The club, absolutely. Did we get greased yesterday? Definitely.\n\n\n\n\nBut to try and paint Liverpool as some big dogs who are chasing crumbs when they should be walking the league is absolutely delusional. Klopp‚Äôs Liverpool have been over-performing for quite a while now.\n\nI didn‚Äôt paint you as big dogs, your fans did that enough for themselves! üòÇ\n\nJust here to point out the hypocrisy that some of your fans thought showing up would be enough to win the Europa league. Fans walking out early of Klopps final European match at Anfield is a disgrace too.\n\nIm really sorry, let me just pull out my phone where i have the number of every living Liverpool fan so i could ask them why they did that.\n\nYou joke about it all ya like, doesn‚Äôt change the facts. \n\nJurgen Klopp deserves better than that, don‚Äôt you agree?\n\nHe does, which is why as i tried to imply, I don‚Äôt understand why they did that, but that behavior is not exclusive to Liverpool fans.\n\n\n\nIf I‚Äôm not mistaken it was only a handful of fans.\n\nEnjoy 7th üëç\n\nProbably not but definitely did enjoy knocking you out of the FA cup &amp; spoiling your league campaign. \n\nKlopps farewell season &amp; the best you can manage is a league cup! üòÇ\n\nHow the mighty have fallen :'( \n\nKlopp cries himself to sleep with his league and champions league medal, whilst mr.eras come to an end and their delulu fans are happy with 7th\n\nIf you‚Äôre referring to United, is Liverpool‚Äôs era coming to an end then if they finish the same way that ten Haag started for United?\n\nYour manager does seem to know, maybe you should ask him instead?\n\nDid he delete his account after making a stupid comment?\n\nYou chatting about delusional fans is major projection, never claimed to be happy with our season! üòÇ \n\nCan‚Äôt handle getting knocked out of every trophy so you try punching down, your fans are a laughing stock! üòÇ\n\nI'll take being a laughing stock and see the team I support win everything in 6 years, you stick to enjoying one off results and getting battered by City in the fa cup final\n\nAh don‚Äôt be so triggered, you‚Äôre not the only one to see your team win something. \n\nIn fact it‚Äôs been a while since you managed to win a league title in front of your fans, what is it, 30/40years now??? üòÇ\n\nYou seem the one triggered trying to redirect the conversation üòÑ I am just stating facts, apparently you don't like them\n\nEnjoy your day buddy üëç\n\nIn what world is Gakpo a first team player, he‚Äôs 5th choice\n\nSomeone you paid ¬£37million for is with the desire to be a first team player.\n\nExplain to me how he‚Äôs first choice when he‚Äôs the 5th best and 5th most expensive out of the forwards, probably on the lowest wage out of them too (him or Diaz I‚Äôd imagine).\n\nIs it really that much of a struggle to understand? \n\nHe‚Äôs played nearly 50times this season &amp; cost nearly 40mill..\n\nMost games off the bench, with constant injuries to our front line. Do you think Joe Gomez and Harvey Elliot are first choice too? \n\nI‚Äôve already disproven your point about cost. The 4 players ahead of him all cost more.\n\nWhat the fuck are you even talking about? You haven‚Äôt disproven anything! üòÇ \n\nTypical Liverpool fan cherry picking stats to suit your argument.. are VVD and salah not first choice now either? They both played too..\n\nYou used his price tag as some sort of evidence that he‚Äôs first choice despite that actively working against your point. All the other forwards cost more than him. Try again.\n\nMate, read these comments back. The only part of your comment I took issue with was saying Gakpo is first choice. The rest was fine. Is that cherry picking? Or is it just not arguing with something I have no issue with? \n\nThen your argument that he‚Äôs played so many games is flawed because so have Elliott and Gomez who also aren‚Äôt first choice. VVD and Salah are first choice yeah, what‚Äôs that got to do with anything?\n\nYou haven‚Äôt got a clue.\n\nThey‚Äôre going to finish the season with just the league cup arent they\n\nYes we are\n\nTime and time ago we crumble at the end of the season. I'm not even bothered anymore\n\nHahaha what? With Klopp we‚Äôve been known to have strong finishes to seasons. The only times we haven‚Äôt were in 2020 (league was won by February) and last season\n\nAnd also, after the abomination that last season ended up being, I‚Äôll take finishing with just the league cup. It‚Äôs more than what the majority of the league will get\n\nI‚Äôm 30 in 2 months and our biggest rivals haven‚Äôt won a trophy since I was 11 months old lol.\n\nFor klopps final season mate I am not happy with a carboa cup only. Would've been happy with Europa league especially when seeing the other teams in contention. But now that's gone after losing 3-0 against atalanta. \n\nBad ending to Klopps season. You're more optimistic than me\n\nAt the end of the day, I love Klopp, but he‚Äôs just a manager. \n\nIn Shankly‚Äôs last season we only won the fa cup. Klopp is the closest thing we‚Äôve had to Shankly and following his retirement we dominated football for a decade. If that‚Äôs the sacrifice for now I‚Äôd take it\n\nour biggest rivals are united not everton\n\nTell me you‚Äôre not from Liverpool without saying you‚Äôre not from Liverpool\n\nnobody in liverpool thinks that either\n\nI‚Äôm from Liverpool mate I think I‚Äôd know üòÇ\n\nNobody from Liverpool ever had to worry about going into school/work the day after a United game thinking their United supporting mates were gonna be taking the piss. It‚Äôs only people who live in areas where you have Liverpool, United, Arsenal, Chelsea fans etc all mingling that they think United is a bigger rivalry\n\nUnited ‚Ä¶\n\nIn the league I believe it‚Äôs the last 10 games Klopp takes an average of 24 points. Guardiola takes an average of 23. \n\nNothing to do with crumbling at the end of the season. It‚Äôs just been ridiculous margins against literal cheats. No need to discredit the team\n\nMancity are known to go WWWWWWWW in their last 10 games. \n\nI'm going to discredit the team this season. We have a striker that can't finish. We have a team that have THRICE in about a month played like they don't give a damn. Manutd fa cup, manutd prem and this atalanta game.  \n\nI've seen every Klopp game, that atalanta performance imo is the worst performance I've seen under Klopp. \n\nWe have Fulham Away, Everton Away , west Ham away and villa away. \n\nIf you really think we are going to do well in our last remaining games then you're deluded.\n\nI've given you a categorical fact of the average points taken lol.\n\nWhatever you wanna do man, I personally choose to believe in the team because what do I have to lose lol.\n\nHow's that belief serving u now? Told u lol\n\nDamn u got me man!!\n\nI did. Let's just look onto next season\n\nDoesn‚Äôt matter what they are known for he gave you a fact\n\nJust basing two dynasties off last year is idiotic\n\n\"cheats\" excuse. It's players vs players, not city's fault Liverpool can't win it\n\n\"excuse\" - yeah and a valid one. putting up multiple 90 point campaigns just to miss out due to financial dopers is bullshit\n\nSo the city players should just give up playing because Liverpool can't cut it?\n\nWhere exactly did I say that?\n\n‚ÄúTime and time again‚Äù\n\n-proceeds to have zero evidence to this claim. \n\nYou‚Äôre not even pessimistic, you‚Äôre just wrong. We finish seasons very strong. Doubters to believers but nah you want to invent some stupid stuff in your head. ‚ÄúCrumble‚Äù, get fucked.\n\nAs a Liverpool fan this is what I fear\n\nIf they finish third with the league cup that‚Äôs the same as ETH‚Äôs first season. I think that‚Äôs pretty neat.\n\nI keep thinking this. It seems to be written in the stars\n\nIts all good, my fellow Liverpudlian brethren never learnt how to read lol\n\nWe about to have a ten haag season. Surely not\n\nThis is fucking amazing! Klopp goes out with the same trophies tenhag entered with! üòÇ\n\nBefore the season started I would have done many dark things to secure CL and getting a trophy as a bonus. This season has been a big success.\n\nAs should be.\n\nIt will be beautiful\n\nIf klopp went trophyless it wouldn‚Äôt matter we‚Äôre gonna have a parade. \n\nWill see all of you in two months, for better or worse.\n\nAtalanta are a good team. Shocker. Third time Serie A sides have beaten Premier League opposition this season in Europe yet the lack of any respect is hilarious.\n\n[removed]\n\nCity leaked some goals against madrid who setup this way. They're used to playing against low blocks and counter attacks in the pl as that's how teams set up against them and still got caught out.\n\nYeah when a PL team beats a serie A team it‚Äôs because they‚Äôre better but when a serie A team beats a PL team the laundry list of excuses comes out. This time it‚Äôs ‚Äôwe‚Äôre focusing on the league.‚Äô\n\nIt‚Äôs cause of money for one, 600m a year versus 200m - by all metrics Liverpool is a far bigger club but in the end it‚Äôs football and they can get stomped. Deserved too cause Atlanta were great\n\n[deleted]\n\nHe‚Äôs talking about on the field of play, you mongoose. Based off of that, I‚Äôd argue that the respect was earned already. Nobody said anything about fans.\n\nIt‚Äôs funny how Prem teams think they could steamroll any opponent that don‚Äôt play in the Prem.\n\nCity get caught from time to time but have dished out some absolute thrashings to top European clubs over the last few years. Leipzig, munich, madrid and even Atalanta.\n\nHappens every year. Look at Man U vs Villareal\n\nTbf only Man U fans think they can steamroll Villareal\n\nMan Utd vs Sevilla last season. The arrogance was insane. It was so fun to see them humbled 3-0 away.\n\nWhat I would be most concerned about from last night is quite how cooked Liverpool looked. They looked really, really lethargic. Atalanta didn't even need to play that well.\n\nAtalanta are a good side capable of upsets and Liverpool were massively sub-par - I‚Äôm not sure many Liverpool fans will be totally heartbroken by the result though. Obviously they‚Äôll have wanted to win but if this means players being fresher and hungrier for the league they‚Äôll probably be okay with that\n\nYesterday we played extremely worse than we normally do. There's nothing else to say about that. This was at Anfield and the crowd somehow gave up after conceding the first goal and even after halftime when after substitutions we had played our first-string line-up except for Trent and Allison (injured) many people weren't singing.\n\nKlopp even shouted at the end just get up and effing sing.\n\nWe are upset but we knew that this loss was coming sometime. Still, though, we remember the time we lost 2-0 at home to Atalanta in the UCL and then beat them 5-0 in the away game!\n\nidk why Pool's chanting game is subpar rn, especially for this season. It's Klopp's last season for god's sake. Like come on your team could turn into a midtable team after he's gone just enjoy what you have right now? Not saying it WILL happen, just a possibility\n\nThis wasn‚Äôt about them throwing it - they were poor and have been for a while. Leaking goals all over the place. It‚Äôs not just a case of being better in the league, they really have to find form from somewhere.\n\nWe ain‚Äôt winning the league, too many players out of form, probably one or two over the hill. Europa league should have been a target.\n\nThey've been banging on for months about how they're gonna win a quadruple for Klopp and now it might just end up with only the league cup, absolutely glorious.\n\nNo they haven't, the media have been banging on about that, creating a narrative.\n\nDespite that, fans are allowed to dream. Nothing wrong, embarrassing, or funny about that.\n\nI guess Trent never said he wanted to win the [quadruple](https://www.tntsports.co.uk/football/premier-league/2023-2024/trent-alexander-arnold-liverpool-star-set-sights-on-unprecedented-quadruple-mentality-you-need-to-ha_sto10011955/story.shtml) this season then?\n\nAh yes he probably should have just said they aren‚Äôt arsed about cup competitions they‚Äôre still in.\n\nVan Dijk was quoted as saying ‚ÄúI won't speak too soon, but hopefully we can win a few more‚Äù when asked about the possibility of a quadruple after the Carabao cup win.\n\nSo yeah Trent should've just said they aren't arsed, obviously.\n\nWhat the fuck is your point lol\n\nTeam wants to win trophies. Absolute shocker.\n\nDo I need to spell it out for you? \n\nGiving an answer like Van Dijk did means there's less pressure on the team, they can go about what they're doing without rival fans and media pile on if the quadruple doesn't happen and the extra motivation for a team of potentially ending the quadruple for Liverpool.\n\nSo how does this equate to the team banging on about winning the quad?\n\nWhere did I say the whole team was 'banging on about winning the quad'?\n\nAh you aren‚Äôt OP it seems but you did respond to their comment as if to agree.\n\nBanging in for months and saying something once aren't the same thing. Nice try though.\n\nSo him saying that he wants to win the quadruple didn't stoke the flames where Liverpool fans would increase talk/discussion about the possibility of them winning the quadruple? \n\nIt was just the media though, sure.\n\nIt did stoke the flames yes - I don't think it's something that has been 'banged on about' with any sort of arrogance.\n\nIt‚Äôs not Liverpool exclusive but there‚Äôs a vocal minority in all fanbases that say some outrageous stuff designed to capture as much engagement as possible whether it be positive or negative. The whole fanbase then gets stereotyped as having that opinion and gets dunked on.\n\nI don‚Äôt think Trent or the Liverpool team are arrogant, I just think Trent didn‚Äôt need to get sucked into it as now the whole fanbase are labelled as thinking the quadruple was definitely happening because of a vocal few\n\n[deleted]\n\nImagine thinking united will win the cup\n\nUnited aren't winning anything\n\nWhere are all the Liverpool fans who are few months ago were saying they were a shoe in to get to all 3 finals and win the league lmao\n\n\"Greatest ever premier league sides\" said the spitty cunt.\n\nThey‚Äôre getting exposed but by bit\n\nLiverpool needs lot of help‚Ä¶ Salah won‚Äôt get it done himself\n\nThat Klopps last dance is turning into a proper harlem shake...after 2 weeks.... first fa cup gone, then tittle charge again obstacle united and now EL.... wouldn't it be funny if eth wins more trophies than klopp this year...\n\nWow no quadrupple\n\nTen hag is in their heads. Totally destroyed their season\n\nLiverpool farewell tour being a ETH season let‚Äôs gooooo!!!!\n\nNew title! Atalanta Rise to Glory As the EPL faces the truth!\n\nCan't believe we have to do yet another outrageous come back job üôÑ\n\nIs it bad that I‚Äôm actually quite excited because I think this is going to happen?\n\nNothing wrong with that lol, you are a fan after all\n\nUnderestimated Atalanta and started a mix and match team, can‚Äôt do that in knockout stages\n\nI'm not a Spurs fan.\n\nCould/should have been 6-0\n\nUsing Harry Maguire as a striker in the FA cup has really broken Liverpool's brains hasn't it /s \n\n\n\nWatch Darwin score a goal from his own box but miss a tap in by bouncing it off the post and into his face against Palace\n\nTbh just getting one trophy would be fitting for Klopps tenure. He‚Äôs done wonderful things there an deserves credit but for the most part they‚Äôve been also-rans rather than champions under him.\n\nWhat gimp downvoted this, deny it please with facts?\n\n[removed]\n\nLove to see it\n\nAbsolutely epic result for Atalanta.\n\nLiverpool? Bad day at the office and one less cup to compete for.\n\nIf I was neutral I'd say Klopp deserves to go out on a high, not holding an inferior squad together with nails, planks and gaffer tape as they shamble towards the finish line showing only a tiny fraction of the determination and energy that they have shown for most of his tenure.\n\nKlopp deserved better than such meekness from his team. They should have fought for him, and they haven't when it matters.\n\nI'm not actually neutral though so Klopp's grand finale season turning into a shitshow amuses me greatly. He deserved to win so much more. For several seasons they were the best I've ever seen a legitimate team be in this league.\n\nHe didnt deserve to win so much more...omg this klopp farewell narrative is getting insuferable\n\nHe did. The only team coming close was City and they were cheating on an industrial scale.\n\nHe didnt.\n\nThe Europa league is a very difficult cup to win. But also it‚Äôs shameful for a big club not to win it and also kind of shameful for a big club to win it.\n\nReally hope they can turn it around. Need them to play as many games as possible.\n\nSorry, Europa League dream? Liverpool fans dream of winning Europa League?\n\n\"Dream\" is a bit of a stretch for a group of players where a lot of them already have Champions League medals.\n\nYa I don‚Äôt think clubs like Liverpool have dreams of Europa League glory.\n\nAnd still have a good chance of winning the Prem (again), which I expect will mean more to them.\n\nCannot wait for the dippers to bottle this. Which they surely will.  The tantrums online will be hilarious üòÇüòÇ\n\nHopefully no brits in Dublin!\n\nAtalanta will smash their way from town to the airport\n\nWhy not?\n\nI guess unless it is the reincarnation of Jackie Charlton\n\nHalf of your country owns a LFC shirt.\n\nThat‚Äôs the point\n\nThey are the enemy who refuse to support Irish clubs\n\nI guess it goes to show the true stature of the club when one loss garners such attention.\n\nAnyway it's not like we haven't been here before, so last night didn't really shock me.\n\nI don‚Äôt think Europa league was ever a priority for Liverpool, the league is what matters this season\n\nThey will probably win the return leg 4-0, and I,m no Liverpool fan\n\nWould need to be 0-4. Return leg returns to Atalanta.\n\nAtalanta can sit back and defend deep if needed. I honestly don‚Äôt see this happening. Would be another miracle if it happens.\n\n[deleted]\n\nIs what you say when you've been spanked 3 zip to make you feel better. Get well soon.\n\nThey played all of their best players. That‚Äôs not what you do when you don‚Äôt care to win - especially when you‚Äôre in an insane trophy race.\nThey just fucked up bad. Don‚Äôt know why but they played like shit.\n\nThey probably thought that they're too big to even try against Serie A's sixth placed side. This despite the Premier League's sixth placed side sending them home from the FA Cup a couple of weeks previously... \n\nJurgen Klopp's Liverpool, the little dynasty that didn't.\n\nYeye, and the Carabao Cup is the single most coveted trophy in world football, we already know.\n\nBros coping. It's like when United won the league cup and all of a sudden, it went from being a MIckey Mouse Trophy when City was dominating to being important."

He punched several players and could be a real nuisance.\n\nRonaldo punched several players?\n\nyea. like petulant swings at his marker if he was having an off day. happened more than once, both with kicks and hits.\n\nnot typically physically harmful hits, as they were typically more like slaps than that, but still violent conduct because he couldn't control himself. that's the other side of how deeply dedicated he was.\n\nNever saw that.¬† Show us a link.\n\nForget that, he‚Äôs also a self confessed rapist.\n\nHe was judged to be innocent. Let's hear your conspiracy theory about how he bought the American judicial system though (something that the likes of P. Diddy and Epstein couldn't do).\n\nWasn't it just because the evidence was obtained illegally and not valid in court? Don't think he was ever judged innocent either, the case was thrown out with no judgement.\n\nRegardless of the outcome, you can always know the person stating someone was \"judged innocent\" hasn't got basis for their claim because there's no such verdict. It's guilty or not guilty.\n\nI love when people are so confidently incorrect\n\nPlease tell me when the trial was\n\nYou‚Äôre totally ignorant\n\nRight..\n\nNice of you to edit your comment from intimating that the person you responded to is OK with rapists but not hitting another player.\n\nOk‚Ä¶? I know that, I‚Äôm just asking about the punching players thing.\n\n[deleted]\n\nWha‚Ä¶? What tf are you talking about? Where did I say it was fine with me you absolute muppet?\n\nThis sub just itches at the prospect of dogpiling anyone.\n\nThe guy asked a legitimate question. The punching players is news to me, if I request confirmation on a public forum am I all of a sudden a rape apologist?\n\nlike petulant swings at his marker if he was having an off day. happened more than once, both with kicks and hits.\n\nnot typically physically harmful hits, as they were typically more like slaps than that, but still violent conduct because he couldn't control himself. that's the other side of how deeply dedicated he was.\n\nI can understand not necessarily reading it like a good faith question as well though, because the topic typically makes it very easy to ask stuff in bad faith since it's basically one's fans screaming at other's fans a lot of the time. so it's not unheard of to ask like that sarcastically.\n\nI've seen him kick out, be petulant and the usual stuff, just didn't remember him out and put punching somone.\n\nYou're not wrong that there's a lot of tribalism and stuff when it comes to anything about Ronaldo and Messi but without any context I tend towards good faith.\n\nAppreciate the rapky, thanks üôè\n\nMessi tried to choke Rodrygo in a match between Argentina and Brazil lol\n\nMessi whacked a Sevilla player on the back of the head trying to get away from him and routinely has held other players by the neck, which looks like he's trying to choke them in confrontation. Also does the patronizing neck hold to try to intimidate players. You can't try this bullshit anymore. This isn't 2012. Drop the \"Messi is a good boy\" act.\n\nMessi took a shit once and I sniffed it and I didn‚Äôt smell nothin‚Äô so fuck you he‚Äôs an angel.\n\nHe did it to Rodrygo at the game where they all left because of ‚Äúpolice violence‚Äù lol. Less than a year ago but he‚Äôs so protected that no one remembers because the press didn‚Äôt even acknowledge it.\n\nHe also made a huge deal of Tony Sanabria supposedly ‚Äúspitting‚Äù on him at the 2023 qualifiers game and other Argentina players started pushing and trying to fight him even though you clearly see from different camera angles he never even spat towards Messi, not even close.¬†\n\nHis family even received death threats and had to close social media accounts because Messi thought he spat on him. That‚Äôs how much of a nice guy he is.\n\nI remember he even punched somevody\n\nThis is ridiculously over exaggerated man lmao. \n\nMessi was being physically battered the entire game before he whacked the player behind the head \n\nThink he‚Äôs probably touched like 3 players by the neck in his entire career of over 1300 games. So no idea where you‚Äôve got routinely from, and when you consider the challenges he‚Äôs dealt with from people I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs good going.\n\nGareth Barry the best lad ever according to that logic, also Messi a racist.\n\nGareth Barry wasn‚Äôt physically battered on a level even closely comparable to Messi. \n\nIf you‚Äôre getting the absolute shit kicked out of you weekly, you‚Äôre going to be far more likely to snap and retaliate. When you look at how much Messi has played and how much he‚Äôs been battered and how little he‚Äôs ever retaliated\n\nNotice how you didn't say anything about the racism though, just my joke about Gareth Barry.\n\nI‚Äôve never seen/heard anything about messi being racist before. So unless you want to provide?\n\nShit kicked out of you weekly.‚Äù Lol calm down. We have all seen the fouls in soccer and most of them amount to light taps.\n\nNational team Messi is a bigger cunt than Ronaldo ever was\n\nThe excuse they give is the reason they don't like him.\n\nWould like to know (honestly!) If atleti fans ever hung an effigy of ronaldo off a railway\n\nThe amount of abuse, threats and racism he has been subjected to has been shocking and unacceptable, and it is right that he speaks out against it, and the malicious masses doing it should be treated very harshly, and more work should be done to educate people and eradicate these poisonous views\n\nIt can also be true that he can be tremendously annoying and insufferable in his play with how much he complains and dives. He's a wonderful player, who also does that kind of thing far too much. \n\nDoesn't mean he deserves any of the above abuse, of course.\n\nIt just all rolls into 'he needs to show some respect' to a league and country that isn't really returning the favour. And it's usually white people telling him to do that\n\nI don‚Äôt remember of Cristiano Ronaldo being a lot more respectful than Vinicius.\n\nBut Ronaldo was ten times the player, so..\n\nThis is it, he at least backed his attitude week in week out. If Ronaldo spoke shit before a match, you just knew he's gonna drop a world class performance. Vini has a lot to do in that regard, either stepping up his game, or better his attitude.\n\nSo basically if Vini pulls off performances like Ronaldo, everyone will suddenly stop bitching about his said attitude? So it‚Äôs not about attitude, right?\n\nIt‚Äôs a combination of the skill and attitude. This is the way every industry on earth works. If you‚Äôre a nice, humble person you can get away with consistent 7/10 performances. If you‚Äôre a consistent 10/10 player you will be enabled in being a dick.\n\nBut you cant be having 7/10 and be a dick. People will start to get tired of you.\n\nit‚Äôs about talking the talk and walking the walk. Vini is a great player, but he talks shit as if he is dropping 40+ goals a season regularly\n\nWalk it like you talk it my friend\n\nEdit: somebody was ahead of me.\n\nBut Khedira here didn‚Äôt mention performance, neither did those who voted for Rodri and bashed Vini. Everyone claimed that the problem is the attitude, not his performance in the field.\n\nThe issue is that Ronaldo did it constantly. He was a machine in that regard. The dude was consistently above everyone else by a long margin. Vini has his moments and is no doubt and amazing player. But he is no CR7. He has not been able to perform consistently at the level Ronaldo and Messi performed every single week.\n\nIt's about backing it up. If you're an absolute bellend and you score a gazillion goals like Ronaldo, who can question you? When you're an absolute bellend and don't back that up, you're just left with a bellend, like Vini Jr.\n\nThat's why being more respectful crap doesn't mean anything. Vini Jr wasn't 100% best player in the world, so he lost on margins.\n\nHe was though, Cristiano whined and was arrogant, but he didn't provoke his opponents nearly as much as Vinicius. He didn't start to insult the fans, yes he would gesture them to calm down or shut up, but Vinicius is much more vulgar and does it even unprovoked, just for shits and giggles.\nCristiano was a diva yes, but he was pretty fair play, Vinicius is a POS.\n\nCristiano also was not super arrogant off the pitch in his earlier years. He also didn‚Äôt whine quite as much in his early years in the premier league.\n\nHaving SAF as a manager will do that to you.\n\nDidn‚Äôt stop him later.\n\nHaha yeah, because they told him to don't fucking do it as it's Enfgland and Fergie hated that type of behaviour.\n\nWhy? because he's taunting racist fans?\n\nRacism is wrong, we all agree on that. Now, as a football player, wtf do you win tauting racist mongoloids ?\nCamavinga, R√ºdiger, Rodrygo, Tchouameni, Mendy are all black and haven't had nearly as many problems with fans and opponents. This narrative making out Vinicius to only being a victim is ridiculous. Yes he is a victim, but also a bully. Both can coexist.\nVinicius has a big attitude problem, someday god forbid some defender is going to hit him with an ugly tackle and possibly gravely injure him just to get back at him.\n\nSo you want him to calm down and do nothing in the hopes that people won't abuse him and not fight back.\n\nHe is a bully for telling the fans to fuck off?\n\nDefenders already do that. You just want him to be a good boy and not stand up for himself? Tf is wrong with y‚Äôall and Vini gets more hate than the others because he is better, has more flair and fights back against racism.\n\nRonnie didn't need to insult fans.  He was too busy throwing strops on the pitch at his own teammates.\n\nCristiano was whiny on the pitch as well but not as much as him.\n\nI can't stand Ronaldo, but he's nothing like Vini\n\nEven Messi had his moments\n\nHe at least didn't refuse to turn up to a ballon d'Or ceremony just because he wasn't going to win..\n\nActually Cristano didn‚Äôt attend when Modric won it and he also skipped twice when Messi won.\nAre dumb or just ignorant?\n\nLet‚Äôs consider the weird idea that players and the media voted for Rodri because they thought he had a better season that Vinicius.\n\nLmao I remember people unironically comparing goals and assists between Vini and Rodri and suggesting nothing other than racism and hatred for Vini could be reason Rodri won üòÇüòÇüòÇ\n\n(Just want to say that racism is absolutely unacceptable, just to be clear)\n\nlol Rodri had the better player and had the better season. Only casuals will think it was a robbery\n\nDon‚Äôt be wanna be that guy but it‚Äôs always about his attitude and standard that isn‚Äôt applied to certain other players\n\nNope, it‚Äôs the loudest dog whistle ever but nobody wants to acknowledge it. PLENTY of players do worse than vini every single time they play, yet one name constantly pops up. \nNot to say many players from different background don‚Äôt receive this treatment, but I have certainly noticed those voices are louder when those players are non white\n\nName me one player that is a bigger whiner, taunter and all around douche bag to other players, refs and fans than him! There is really no one that comes close. \n\nAnd I think he one of the most (if not the most) talented and exciting footballers in the world. And has been for a few years now. But it drives me insane when acts the way he does. He is so good, he doesn‚Äôt need the theatrics, the bitching and diving. If he stopped all of that a focused on football I believe he would win the Ballon d‚ÄôOr immediately.\n\n[deleted]\n\nIt‚Äôs not because he‚Äôs white, lol. It‚Äôs because he isn‚Äôt arguably the best player in the world and hardly anyone knows him\n\nThey hate him cause he has rawdogged the entirety of europe twice already.\n\nNo doubt what khedira means is Vinicius should absorb the racism targeted at him and pretend it isn‚Äôt happening because in Khedira‚Äôs world it isn‚Äôt happening.\n\nBro Khedira was a turk playing for Germany, need I say more?\n\nYou probably do need to say more.\n\nPlayers like √ñzil, Khedira and others got a lot of hate from both Turkish and German fans. The German critics was valid in terms of some players not singing the anthem but also heavily racist especially when the squad wasn‚Äòt performing well.\n\nOk. Let‚Äôs assume I have missed something. What does Khedira mean? What instances of disrespect is he referencing? Bearing in mind I haven‚Äôt seen any headlines about Khedira, on a weekly basis experiencing racism, and you know and I know that there is a hierarchy of racism, with whites at the top and blacks at the bottom so the experience of the middle tier to the bottom tier is not the same.\n\nI don‚Äòt really follow Vini but I saw when the scene with Kimmich. I mean come on he probably isn‚Äòt the most disrespectful Player ever but the hate doesn‚Äòt come from nothing.\n\nYou haven‚Äòt seen these headlines because Khedira‚Äòs peak was 10 years ago and you‚Äòre not German.\nI don‚Äòt doubt that vini gets more racially attacked but I didn‚Äòt argument against that it‚Äòs just the original comment implying Khedira doesn‚Äòt really know what racism is.\n\nThose hierachy of racism may apply to the US especially but in other parts in the world the structures are way more complex and different.\n\nThis is where we agree to disagree and go our separate ways as I am unable to entertain a debate about the things that black people do or have done to justify the hate towards them. Because if peoples actions were a reason for meting out hate then black people would have a whole 1000+ years to go round exacting revenge on certain people. It‚Äôs a known fact that blacks people who resist are considered uppity, a legacy from slavery days. Even my qualified Doctor (not nurse, not receptionist, Doctor) sister with all her skill and knowledge was expected to hold place in her profession. Khedira more than likely subscribes to the hierarchy I mentioned, which is to say yes he does or has experienced racism but he cannot appreciate the depths of hatred that someone like Vinicius has to suffer, even in Vinicius‚Äô own country. If Khedira as a ‚Äònormal‚Äô average earning man was to emigrate to Brazil it would be interesting to see how quickly he would rise through the social and career ladder compared to an indigenous black person. The facts are the facts. But you didn‚Äôt actually give me any examples of what Vinicius is doing wrong. I‚Äôm not saying I know everything but I invest a lot of time in understanding as much as possible about the dynamics of other countries, including Turkey, and probably where you‚Äôre from, so that I don‚Äôt just take the Western propaganda narrative of news outlets like Sky news and CNN and BBC about these countries or their people. Perhaps you could do the same.\n\nI literally gave you an example when Bayern was playing against Real and he threw the Ball away which Kimmich gave to him.\n\nI never even generalized about black people as a whole or even implied that if there are reasons to hate somebody it‚Äòs legitimate to do so.\n\nI mean Vinicius clearly is hated by racist insults to a large degree but I don‚Äòt think it‚Äòs mainly to do with him being black.\nIf that‚Äòd be the case why are most black players not hated if the main reason for Vini‚Äòs hate is his race?\n\nSo you‚Äôve never seen other players show aggression on the pitch? Rooney, Beckham, Luis Saurez. And I‚Äôm sure there are a current crop of players who show up regularly.\nI mean I don‚Äôt really need to give examples. When your adrenaline is going on the pitch there is some margin of aggression you can expect. And neither am I accusing you of anything, I‚Äôm just suggesting that it‚Äôs prudent to give a  wider consideration of his experience(s) rather than implying that he deserves it, especially when you see thousands of fans abusing him even if he hasn‚Äôt thrown the ball at someone. There is far more work to be done outside of Vinicius rather than within Vinicius. But it‚Äôs very easy to target the person with least power and who no one has sympathy for. Suella Braverman, Rushi Sunak, Priti Patel, Kamala Harris, Piers Morgan, Sheila from LBC, Julia Hartley Brewer, Sky News, BBC, GBN, the UK public. All the above showing undying support for Israel‚Äôs activities in the Middle East. But who do the young Muslim men show their anger to? Floyd Mayweather. Wow! Vinicius‚Äô experience is not isolated. It is a manifestation of an existing universal dynamic.\n\nI‚Äòm not denying that there‚Äòs systematic racism but as you said it‚Äòs more from the elite than someone else. \nI mean in Western Europe Arabs are way more racist to black people than Whites are.\n\nIsrael vs Palestine is another difficult topic which you bring up here but it‚Äòs really obvious why a lot of politicians support Israel and I don‚Äòt wanna get to deep into this.\n\nGood that you bring someone up like Suarez cause he was also really hated in the amount even comparable to Vini but it was a different time Social Media wise.\n\nShowing emotion is normal and I now this very well but in the clip with Kimmich he wasn‚Äòt provoked or anything it was just unnecessarilly disrespectful.\n\nI honestly think he would also be really hated if he was white or asian but I do think being black makes him an easier target somewhat.\n\nI just think he's unlikeable to some people it's not his fault. Ronaldo was a crybaby at an even worse rate and threw terrible tantrums.\n\nAnd a rapist.\n\nWe wont see a Messi and Ronaldo in a VERY long time.\n\nThe best players today wont ever reach the peak Messi and Ronaldo had.  That generation of football fans got lucky.  Very rare to see two players pushing the level of the sport so far ahead at the same time.\n\nKhedira is right , but even bringing in the debate that he might be comparable to Messi and Ronaldo is ridiculous\n\nOther players like Vardy, Ramos, Suarez &amp; Emi Martinez, Roy Keane &amp; Griezzman can act like absolute cunts on the field, dance and taunt opposition fans with no problems to their reputation or people saying the don‚Äôt deserve their praise but Vini Jr &amp; Pogba indulging in similar acts rubs these people off. Interesting pattern here I must say.\n\nThis is a direct respsonse to Vini not winning the Balon D'Or. Because he's a great footballer. And great footballers now will be compared to Messi and Ronaldo.\n\nRoy Keane was from a different era.  Suarez was roasted for some of his stuff. Emi Martinez gets plenty of stick. So does Neil Maupay. Haaland's Stay Humble is memed left right and centre.\n\nStay Humble is memed left right and centre by Arsenal fans lol. I know because I am one and it is doing my fucking head in ü§£\n\nYou say EMI Martinez gets plenty of stick when he‚Äôs literally won the goal keeper ballon d‚Äôor back to back years now but many people assuming you included are saying that Vini‚Äôs on field behaviour should count against him for the ballon d‚Äôor that‚Äôs literally the definition of double standards¬†\n\nSuarez is literally racist ,has odaxelagnia , spits at people and cry‚Äôs to refs and is a horrible person go into detail don‚Äôt just say ‚Äúsome of his stuff‚Äù .\nYou guys just hate Vini.\n\nEmi Martinez the current holder of the GK of the year?\n\nHave not seen any footballers telling Haaland to be respectful though‚Ä¶\n\nHe‚Äôs the humblest footballer in the world. He can‚Äôt get any more respectful if he tried‚Ä¶\n\nI mean, people hate Ramos and Suarez with a passion so there's that. Also, other than Griezmann doing Fortnite celebrations for his daughter I don't really remember him being a bitch on field?\n\nComparing Griezmann's behaviour with Vini is peak Real Madrid delusion.\n\nLumping Griezmann in with those war criminals is nasty work\n\nHaha a list of butchers, poor Griezmann\n\nYou're blind or what? All the players you mentioned are hated by a lot of people. The main difference is that racism isn't involved like in Vini's case, that's another issue\n\nRoy Keane‚Ä¶ what a cunt who gets so much respect. I‚Äôll never respect someone who purposefully broke other players legs. \n\nVini‚Äôs attitude isn‚Äôt near Roy Keane‚Äôs behavior, yet I don‚Äôt hear people asking TV to drop Roy Keane\n\nSame with ramos tbh people worship him and stuff but all I can remember is salah's shoulder whenever I see someone mention him\n\nWhen did Roy Keane purposefully break someone's leg?\n\nHe broke Haaland's father's foot in retaliation. He played for man city\n\nSpot on\n\nIt‚Äôs totally a coincidence that black players happen to be held to a higher standard of conduct‚Ä¶\n\nYeah no one wants to say but it‚Äôs clear there‚Äôs biases against players. Idk if it‚Äôs black or not black but certain players have way better PR\n\nNone of them won a ballon dor, that is literally what the article is about.\n\nOther than Suarez and Keane none of those players compare to Vini in terms of immaturity and terrible attitude\n\n&gt; with no problems to their reputation\n\nMost players you listed has a far worse reputation than Vini. Who's out there saying Suarez has a good attitude?\n\nWhich one of those players did not have a reputation for being dirty lol what a wild argument\n\nNone of those players have good reputations. Vardy is always taunting the opposition fans, Swarez is a bit bitey and Roy Keane was is completely unapologetic for what happened with Haaland.\n\nI noticed you missed Bruno Fernandez off your list.  He is pretty much universally considered to be a whiney unpleasant asshole even by Man Utd fans.\n\nGriezzman really? When hast he ever been cunt can someone tell me moment? When he is\n\nIf you are using the race card, just think of  [N'Golo Kant√©](https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1VDKB_enMY997MY997&amp;sca_esv=08af81acf73058fc&amp;cs=0&amp;sxsrf=ADLYWIK9whI8Ff-07B51IxkhueerqBKitw:1733850900966&amp;q=N%27Golo+Kant%C3%A9&amp;stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAOMwVGI0-MXoGJyfnJxapOCbmZKWmZqTklpUrKCv4JyRmlOcmqjgpuesB-S6FSXmJacq5CWWZObnJeYopOXnlyQl5uQolKQm5v5i4oh39QvxDImM38DC-IqFl4tbP1ffwNCgqNKsrPIVCzcXJ4hvVF6RYwnnmRhWmJnCeeYmlZUGcJ5FWYZZOZyXYZRdnv2KhYeLC8QrjzdOMbSAS5oamORawCUzTA2zDBB2GCeZguzg5-LVT9c3NEyqSLIoNjdIRoikFVtWFJlXmCDcaJpcYgA3zrg8KbmoEKE82bC8MCnNxADJANOc8qq09PJFrLx-6u75OfkK3ol5JYdX3mKTZOh-2mOsrDEp8J_jxB37Ny_cfEf_5R_XIhbuSRxCmEE-iYMHOcgnccjiDXIAmSmnobwBAAA&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwia0Kr42Z2KAxXkcWwGHTQ_K40Q7fAIegQIABBc).  \nFull stop.\n\nAll those players can be charming when they want to\n\nDon‚Äôt remember any of them winning the Ballon d‚ÄôOr.\n\nI don't know if Cristiano Ronaldo can be described as respectful after that piers morgan interview and throwing shade at Messi several times\n\nAnd raping a woman...\n\nIt's time we start acknowledging this whole narrative about Vinicius being \"angry\" and \"disrespectful\" for what it is\n\nYou can say it's racist, because that's what it is. It's fucking criminal. That this has been allowed to continue for so long. Racism is traumatic. Letting him be abused constantly is disgusting.\n\nI am racist for calling him a dick that did not deserve to win? \n\nFor note. My favorite player at Arsenal is Saka. My wish transfer is Nico W. \n\nCorrect me if I‚Äôm mistaken but aren‚Äôt they all shades but white? Perhaps Vini and his attitude are a deal breaker for some people and not his skin?\n\nGuy plays with a smile on his face but of course \"black=angry\", dancing when he score a goal=disrespectful.\n\nBut run 50 yards jump in the air spin around and matador crotch thrust while shouting \"Suuuuu!\" = very respectful\n\nHonestly, fuck anyone saying shit like that. Heavy \"know your place black person\" vibes\n\nThat would make sense if you could make an arguement that Messi or Ronaldo behaved worse. If anything Messi accomplished more AND had a better attitude.\n\nVini acts like a cunt on the pitch \nCan't we be critical  of him because  of that?\n\nPlenty of other players ger thr same treatment\nFfs ronaldo gets the treatment of acting  like a cunt\n\nAre you american? People can't even be critical of a black person now? Your treating black people different by doing that. That would be racist\n\nNo, I'm a white middle aged bloke from England that spent some time studying how race is portrayed in the media in my youth and it opened my eyes.\n\nYou should try it.\n\nstop the wokeness. Khedira has Tunisian ancestry by the way\n\nTunis my beloved black country\n\nI agree. This shit stinks of it.\n\nYeah right‚Ä¶\n\nIt‚Äôs funny how it‚Äôs always the black athletes that have to ‚Äòstay humble‚Äô what a load of shite.\n\n[deleted]\n\nLol good jerk\n\nHe's not worse than Messi\n\nDoes ‚Äúangry attitude‚Äù mean dick?\n\nYeah but did Messi or Ronaldo run up to the guy who's paid to hold the extra mins counter and go:\n\n**\"SEIS MINUTO? SEIS MINUTO???? JAJAJAJAJJAJAJAJAJAJA\"** üíÄ\n\nHe will never become like Messi or Ronaldo. I just feel like I have to put that out there.\n\nWhy does this award have any credibility for real\n\nHomelander was respectful?\n\nBallon d or is a popularity contest\n\nThose 2 aliens were on a level where world class players playing at their absolute peaks got rewarded with a distant 3rd place on the podium. And that was an honor lol\n\nI couldn‚Äôt imagine a player throwing a tantrum because they didn‚Äôt win and skipping the ceremony back then.(besides older CR7) I think the Balon D‚ÄôOr has become a little less prestigious and we don‚Äôt even realize it yet. Vini wants the Messi Ronaldo treatment just for being in the best ITW conversation for a year or 2. \n\nFeels like any player with a top 3 finish from this point on would just be fighting for that 3rd along with everybody else in that era and it‚Äôs going to be that way for a long time.\n\nHe will never be like they two\n\nAlso much much better\n\nRespectability politics? In my football?\n\nHe needs to stop being a crybaby, agree.\n\nIs ronaldo respectful? Seems like a brat to me\n\nVini doesn‚Äôt belong in the same sentence as Messi or Ronaldo.\n\nNot wrong, Rodri was always going to win but a humble attitude goes a long way to help too.\n\nBro vinicius last year √Æn the champions league had one more goal than hoijlund  ( who exited in the group stage) . Not saying he isn't one of the best players in the world but I am glad he didn't win the Ballon d'or\n\nRonaldo has turned into a grumpy moaning git as his capabilities have waned.  He can hardly be less respectful to his team mates and coaching staff\n\nI wonder what it‚Äôll be like if Ronaldo and Messi had full stands being racist/discriminating against them\n\nRodri won because he plays in a better, more competitive league.  Anyone that disagrees is huffing huge copium.\n\nVini is unlikeable but that shouldn‚Äôt matter.  My opinion is that this year was close between him and Rodrigo, Vini wasn‚Äôt a clear winner and I‚Äôm tired of people pretending he was.  Could he have won? Sure, was he a clear winner? No.  Rodri seems fair to me, as I would have said the same if Vini won.  People making out like Vini was clear undoubtably winner this year like a 2002 Ronaldo Nazario, fuck off.\n\nVinicius J√∫nior helps schools and kids through his institute, which are things that I lot of players don‚Äôt give a fuck about and act on their hedonism. Fuck this fake humble, exemplary and honest fa√ßade. He already does his part. \n\nThis ‚Äúhe‚Äôs a cunt‚Äù thing is pure racism. He ain‚Äôt gotta be respectful, confidence is something that all Brazilian players have, and they express it their own way. We provoke, we dance and we have fun. Get down to any dirt field, futsal court, or sand court, and that‚Äôs we do it. Vinicius has to step up his game, but he doesn‚Äôt have to change who he is.\n\nThen he will never be respected, as simple as that\n\n\"More respectful\" Or for him to stop confronting racism head on without no fear? Im confused Sami...\n\nMore respectful as in stop provoking everyone and picking up fights with everyone\n\nVinicius is an abject tosser as a person. He doesn't deserve any accolades unless he sorts out this personality disorder.\n\nPeople will actively deny that Vinny has a bad attitude and will blame the hate solely on racism.\n\nMeanwhile, players like Kante, who is well known to be one of the most humble players on the planet, has constantly been praised and adored by fans of football world wide without issue.\n\nMakes you think.\n\nBe more respectful? Why respect the racists? They don't want him to make waves. Might have been different if he wasn't black\n\nSame Messi who was racist to Drenthe, mocked a cancer survivor and choked Rodrygo?\n\nCasemiro choked Hughes. It is normal /s\n\nEdit: Forgot /s\n\nIn what world is either Messi or Ronaldo ‚Äòrespectful‚Äô\n\nCompared to Vini, they are.\n\nStop watching football. Messi is probably the most respected player in every possible sport\n\nAnd if khedira wanted to be more like schweinsteiger he should've had a better ball control, better spacing, more creativity and antecipation. Also blonde hair.¬†\n\nShut up, be who you wanna be mate.\n\nCan't agree more with him\n\nDifference between an angry player and a passionate player is always race\n\nWe dont need a personality contest. Best player wins that‚Äôs it\n\nliterally no one would be saying this if he was white\n\nLmao\n\nCan pull out a 10-15 minute vid of vini provoking players ( ronaldinho got standing ovation from bernabeu and won a ballondor never knew him for a white guy)\n\nYou're missing the point. Dinho didn't provoke anyone, Vini does. But when a white player does it, he's a loveable c*NT. Remember when Diego Costa used to square up and almost fight with an opposing player every match? C*nt. \n\nVini provokes an opponent, C*nt,  hung over a bridge, racist chants before matches, teams chanting about you without even facing you that week, can't win the Balon Dor with that attitude. \n\nLet's talk about Benzema. Loveable C*nt right?, Benzema 15 is a joke now and blackmail doesn't matter right? \n\nSame team, same trophies, not the same award. Because talking shit on the pitch, is worse than blackmailing a teammate.\n\nThis is why these conversations can't be taken seriously. Because people like you take gigantic leaps without making sense.\n\nDiego Costa was a cunt that was only loved by the fans he played for. Same as with any club. \n\nBenzema 15 is a meme so that people don't forget he's a pedo. Apart from Madrid fans who the hell thinks he's lovable?\n\nVini threw his toys out of the pram and sulked despite not having a better season than Rodri. Instead of being respectful about it and just working on it for next season he has his club and teammates attacking Rodri and the award itself. \n\nVini is amazing but Rodri was better for both club and country. But instead of accepting that it's turned into a race war.\n\nWhat about Lewan-fucking-dowski? When he was robbed, where were the racists? What was the conspiracy then? Thierry Henry, totally robbed. Rivaldo won it in 1999, wasn't even close to being the best player than season\n\nThat's why people  shit on ronaldo and busqets  for being wankers?\n\nvini gets x10 the abuse those guys do, not a fair comparison at all\n\nSami can be more respectful. And maybe not talk.\n\nThe others were equally respectless and arrogant, Vini just seems a lot more classless in his on pitch behaviour. I feel like the classlessness is what gets him most of the flak\n\nThe amount of hate this generation is getting because of Messi and Ronaldo is insane.\nThey were great players and all but not fucking saints.\n\nThe same Vini that was racially abused in Valencia literally donated to the same damn city when it was flooded.\n\nYou people have time to hate yet have no skills or talent ü§ê\n\nGetting racially abused once a month. No wonder he‚Äôs angry.\n\nI dunno why he gets so much shit, I mean I suppose it comes with the territory of playing for Real Madrid still think it's a bit much...\n\nit‚Äôs because he dared to be black and play football in a racist country/continent\n\nnothing new today\n\nBoth things can be true. He absolutely does get racist abuse no denying that and it‚Äôs not fair and needs to be dealt with. He is also a bit of a twat too. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair to keep attributing it all to racism cause it takes away from When people are actually being racist.\n\nSo they're telling a victim of racism to keep his head down and behave? Unsurprisingly disgusting!\n\nAs big of a diva as Ronaldo was I never remember him doing anything like Vini did against Bayern to Kimmich.  That clip alone made it clear who he is and made me completely dislike him as a person.\n\nRonaldo raped a woman. Why do¬† people keep forgetting about that?\n\n..... you got me there.... Idk how so many of us forget this...."

Issue is always with flight time due to the battery size so it‚Äôs impossible to get full coverage of a session.\n\nUm, just get more than one drone then?\n\n Wow. Just when you think you‚Äôve seen everything in this sport lol\n\nI mean, its just a modern equivalent of whats gone on in football for 60+ years.\n\nIn the past scouts would stand on ladders peaking over fences and watching opposition training sessions. It was not unheard of for them to rent bedrooms from people living by training grounds for a week before a game to watch and take notes. \n\nThis is just the 2024 version. \n\nnot saying its right, but its been going on as long as football has been a thing\n\nThere are so many things which were done differently 60+ yrs ago or whichever other year range you want to use. \n\nThey weren‚Äôt ok then and surely aren‚Äôt ok now. As other things which were acceptable 60+ yrs ago but didn‚Äôt make sense then and definitely do not make sense now.\n\nUsually when we compare things that were ok 60 years ago and not now, its a much darker conversation. Of all things that were ok then and not now, cheating in sporting events is definitely on the lighter side\n\nthis is very common in football, one recent example is in the days leading up to Spain v Germany at the Euros, security was playing loud music outside the German training camp to prevent the disproportionately many Spanish journalists in the town from overhearing training instructionsy\n\nCanada were the defending gold medal winners for the women BTW what a way to end your Olympic aspirations\n\nWell actually‚Ä¶ win their final match and Canada still advances to knockout rounds thanks to a 102‚Äô winner against France today.\n\nGood luck\n\nüòÉ\n\nThey will still probably go through\n\nThis aged poorly, they are through suck it MF\n\nI don‚Äôt care about Olympic football but congratulations\n\nLmao they got through\n\nStill not as bad as having a child rapist compete\n\nWho?!\n\nüá≥üá±\n\nPlayer name?\n\nSteven van de Velde\n\nJust looked it up üíÄ\n\nThey are sanctioned for sports issues  \nAny other crime not related to this is always ignored\n\nThere are 11 and 12 year old competitors. It's a safeguarding issue and should not be ignored.\n\nI am not against puting a rule to ban sportists that have killed or raped, but here comes another problem, do you trust in all the countries judicial systems? Where do we draw the line? A violent person should be banned for hurting people? what if happened 15 years ago? etc.\n\nAlso, someome could say they dont want any ex-criminal, including who has been proven guilty for minor things.\n\nIn addition, a lot of people could say that you have already paid for the crime so you shouldnt be punished more. Otherwise you are saying the punishment wasnt enought insulting that country judificial system.\n\nAs you see, it is not as simple as people think.\n\nIt's a sports governing body, it doesn't give a shit about the regular judicial system's double jeopardy principles.\n\n\nBy that logic you might as well say any sanctions, restrictions or punishments against athelets are bogus if the offense didn't lead to a criminal conviction, can't have been that bad if the courts didn't get involved.¬†\n\n\n&gt; do you trust in all the countries judicial systems?¬†¬†\n\n\nAthelets that are targeted by their nations regime/judiciary will most likely miss out on the chance to represent that nation at the Olympics anyway.¬†\n\n\n&gt; Also, someome could say they dont want any ex-criminal, including who has been proven guilty for minor things.¬†\n\n\nIs that someone in the room with us right now?¬†\n\n\nImagine the first folks writing laws, a couple thousand years ago, maybe the Babylonians. You think someone was like *\"guys are you sure we should start with this? What if someone says every petty crime and broken contract warrants the death penalty, that'd be kinda bad no? Let's keep things without laws, that makes things either, at least then we don't have to disagree with that someone if he does indeed speak up.\"*\n\nAnd yet they're one win away from progressing to the knockouts.\n\n[removed]\n\nCoach is a woman.\n\nSo what ? Women can‚Äôt rape ?\n\nNot my point.\nBut maybe one should read the article and get the most basic information straight before posting very strong opinions.\n\nThey are sanctioned for sports issues  \nAny other crime not related to this is always ignored\n\nIf only they used the drones to obliterate Palestinian children instead of spying on trainings, then maybe they could have avoided being sanctioned.\n\nOof.\n\nr/drones\n\nOh well\n\nIf your not cheating your not competing\n\n50 of Canadian comments: God this is embarrassing. Who would ever have thought one of our fellow countrymen has cheated so blatantly?\n\n\nThe other 50% of Canadian comments: Uh actually Russia has cheated lots and also there are CRIMINALS competing and also cheating is 100% normal and everyone is doing it and also Isreal! Cheating is in integral part of sport, and it's actually Conmebols fault. And anyone who disagrees is a woke, virtue signalling hypocrite.¬†\n\n\nRest of the world: ... ........ ?...¬†\n\nThe second 50% are correct. The sad part about the ‚Äúpunishment‚Äù to the athlete is it actually only hurts the other countries as now the bracket is a mess where 2nd seeds play each other and 1st seeds play other.¬†\n\nOne first seed isn‚Äôt going to get to play for a medal because of this.¬†\n\nand the team said, hold our beer.\n\nGuess what? They still went through. Being deducted 6 points aint enough to knock them outt mfkers!!!!1\n\nReally? you coult try to cheat to win the world cup/euros etc but the olympics? No big names from the football world go there, 1 or 2 max per squad, the rest are average players\n\nThe senior squads are used for the women's section.\n\nAnd yet... a child rapist is allowed to play.\n\nThey are sanctioned for sports issues  \nAny other crime not related to this is always ignored\n\nCheater, ban this country from olympics\n\n[removed]\n\nThey cheated, cheaters get banned\n\nIt is a team sport , if the manager or other coaches have began cheating , the team shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to compete. \n\nThere is no way of knowing how much the players know , all members of the team have a responsibility to play by the rules , coaches included. And sanctions applied for the whole team\n\nAwe we're sorry eh?\n\n[removed]\n\n[removed]\n\nWhat a loser.\n\nThe stinkers got mad at this oneüòÇ\n\n[removed]\n\nInsane they are not banned, and really should have the gold from Tokyo stripped aswell, as if they are cheating now, all previous victories have to be treated as the fruits of cheating.\n\nRelax\n\n[deleted]\n\nBelieve it or not, straight to the guillotine."

On the plus side, looks like ter stegen finnaly gets his chance to play an international tournament.\n\nI mean its a hit they purposely took. In the next two years we will try to build a new strong team with young promising players replacing the ones who retired now\n\nTo be honest it was long overdue. \n\nGermany on 2017 on confederation cup did the right thing on putting youngsters and they pulled out the win and it look really bright for them \n\nThen on 2018 for whatever reason they went a step back and use lots of the players of 2014 and many out of shape players and have a group exit \n\n2022 comes and while its a good mix of the old guard + youngsters , it lack a lot of what make ‚ÄúGermany special‚Äù and another group stage KO put Germany on a state of chaos and it even showed after on friendlies when Japan destroy Germany 1-4 at Germany‚Äôs own backyard \n\n2024 is a shine of new hope because Nagglesmann understands perfectly what is the German philosophy and with new youngsters they will strive to be the next golden generation and they look really promising , examples like Writz the best bundesliga player and MVP with Leverkusen and Musiala whose one of the best bayern players and is really insane in dribbling and could be one of the best sooner than we think\n\nTer Stegen will be his replacement in the international scene unless the national team coach decides otherwise.¬†\n\nHe‚Äôs not exactly young though\n\n32, still has another 5 years left in him\n\nWhos 2nd choice after ter stegan?\n\nStill open. Right now it‚Äôll likely be decided between Trapp, Baumann, and probably Leno and N√ºbel. If Diant Ramaj decides to represent Germany over Kosovo maybe Ramaj in a little while. \n\nGermany has no shortage of *very* good goalkeepers, that would probably start for most other countries. Germany is also blessed with very promising younger generations. We‚Äôll be fine with goalkeepers for the foreseeable future.\n\nWell Ter Stegen might finally get some minutes\n\nYeah. I remember seeing a stat that showed that Ter Stegen has played ZERO minutes for the Germans since the 2016 Euros. Absolutely insane\n\nMan was just that unlucky that he was at his best while Neur was playing.\n\nWhere did you find this stat?\n\nHe did play while Neuer had a broken leg. Maybe you meant for Germany in an international competition\n\nIf he‚Äôs lucky he has 2 tournaments left\n\nGoatkeeper\n\nlegend\n\nGenerational keeper who was the first one to define this new ‚Äúsweeper keeper‚Äù role we have. Sensational personality and goes down as one of the best ever.\n\nYeah for real. Hopefully his style of keeping has transformed the younger generation of keeping and making it interesting!\n\nYeah I feel it definitely has. I support Notts County and we‚Äôre in League 2, but we‚Äôre in the National League recently which is the fifth division in England. We were looking for a goalkeeper who was good with his feet for our style of play!\n\nTer Stegen might finally play\n\nRemember watching him in the euros vs italy. My god was he class that game\n\nDidn‚Äôt I just yesterday read he is only taking a break for a couple of months?\n\nHe was the last from the 2014 team\n\nGinter is still around. G√∂tze also has not formerly retired from the NT\n\nMuller?\n\nAnnounced his retirement from international football in July.\n\nAlready retired from national team some time ago bro\n\nKevin Trapp can do something really funny right now\n\nCrazy how Ter Stegen might finally get a chance at 32\n\nWhat a legend. He was the one who made me enjoy watching ball playing goalkeeping. He was so comfortable with the ball during his playing days.\n\nAs some already said, long overdue imo.\nWhat an international career! He can be proud\n\nNubel rn: allow me to introduce myself\n\nWow! He's truly one of the legends of the game. I‚Äôve been a fan of his ever since his impressive performances during his time with FC Schalke 04.\n\nOne of the best GKs of recent times.\n\n\"of recent times\"....lol\n\nTop 5 all time more like, scratch that top 3\n\nWho else is your top 3?\n\nYashin, Buffon\n\nNice.\n\nEnjoy ter Stegen finally\n\nI have a feeling Ter stegen will get injured or something for the World Cup now that it‚Äôs finally he‚Äôs chance\n\nTer Stegen rejoice!!\n\nLegend!!!! ü¶Ñ\n\nFinally!! It took him long enough. He was almost trying to be another version of Buffon.\n\n\nHappy retirement.¬†\n\nNeuer coming back from retirement for the next world cup realising ter stegen is the next choice playerüîÅ\n\nHappy retirement legend!\n\nNothing will ever be the same without him\n\nTer Stegen just popped a bottle of Champagne and keeps saying \"it's about bloody time\" lol!!!\n\nA true footballing legend\n\nEnd of an era\n\nThe original keeper sweeper.\n\nTer Stagen must be shaking from the spider's web at the moment.\n\nBest goalkeeper in the world, no question. Sad to see that he‚Äôs getting older and will retire soon, enjoy watching him while you can.\n\nSo ter stegen takes over now?\n\nThe goalkeeping goat\n\nHe was a great player. It was fun watching him as an England fan\n\noverrated\n\nIt's Stegen Time to show himself Worth IT '''\n\nAbout time\n\nif ter stegen does good for country maybe some foolish club will buy him from barca\n\nTer Stegen taking up from Manuel Neuer just embodies the decline of German Football and Germany in general. Sad to see.\n\nCome join Marco in LA, Manny!!\n\nHe‚Äòs still at Bayern, only retired from the NT.\n\nI know, but they need to share the love. Would love to see Neuer playing in the US.\n\nRobbed of 2014 wc pott"

    "title": "Is football becoming... striker-less?",
    "body": "One of the most common conclusions, from both fans and experts, about the recent Euro was the complete lack of amazing striker performances in the competition. It's no coincidence that 6 players were tied for the golden boot (half of them not even strikers), while UEFA named Musiala for the striker spot, on their official Team of the Tournament. *Musiala has never played a single game as a striker/false 9 on his professional career and was a winger throughout the whole competition.* In the previous \"Team of the Tournament\" line-ups, we saw players like Lukaku (2021), Cristiano Ronaldo (2016, 2012), David Villa (2008), Rooney (2004), Totti/Kluivert (2000), Stoichkov/Suker (1996) etc.\n\nIn general, there were so many poor performances from strikers in the recent Euro: Ronaldo, Lukaku, Scamacca/Retegui, Hojlund, Thuram, Sesko, Dovbyk etc. all failed to score a single goal. Morata scored only once in 7 games and was probably Spain's least important starter. Yes, he was involved a lot in the build-up, but I think the rest of Spanish players were just so much better, plus even his manager subbed him off really early every single game, despite being the captain. Other strikers like Kane, Havertz, Mbappe (when he played as a #9), Depay, Lewandowski, Kolo Muani etc. scored 1-3 goals, many of them penalties or simple \"tap-ins\", but in general they never really made a huge impact. The only really good strikers in the competition have been Mikautadze (Georgia) and Schranz (Slovakia). Good players, but definitely not the kind one would call \"world class\". **In comparison**, on the 2020 Euro, Ronaldo, Schick, Kane, Lukaku, Benzema etc. all scored 4+ goals and had pretty good tournaments. \n\n**In 51 Euro 2024 games, only 4 times a striker won the MOTM award** (Watkins, Kramaric, Yilmaz, Kvaratskhelia). And even some of these guys are more false 9 kind of players that drift wide or drop back, not exactly your typical \"target man\".\n\nAnd this isn't only about the 2024 Euro. Real Madrid recently won both UCL and La Liga, while using two wingers as pseudo-strikers that drift wide, while opening space for a box-to-box midfielder who operated often as a shadow striker, with his deep runs inside the box (Bellingham). And next season they'll most likely field... three wingers up front, with the inclusion of Mbappe. Another example is Argentina, they won every possible trophy lately with Alvarez and Messi up front on most games.\n\nNow, I can already see people commenting about the likes of Lautaro or Joselu's impact to the success of these teams. Yes, these strikers scored some important goals and there are still teams getting the best out of their... traditional strikers. City won EPL with Haaland, while Dortmund reached the UCL final with Fullkrug. But generally, many teams seem to have adapted their playstyles into pushing their wingers as their main goalscorers, not their #9s. The #9s are more of a false 9, sort of very advanced playmaker, look at Morata's role for Spain. Receive the ball up front, wait for the wingers or fullbacks to make runs and pass them the ball. The striker is not the focal point of the attacks anymore. *Even world class players with some characteristics of the traditional striker are much more involved in the build-up than they used to be 15 or 20 years ago, Kane, Lewandowski, Suarez and especially Benzema were prime examples of that.* Real Madrid, Liverpool, Arsenal, PSG, Real Sociedad etc. are all clubs that more or less have this kind of approach.\n\nSo, what created this? Are the current generation's strikers simply not good enough finishers, so teams have to adapt into using tactics where the striker is just someone who creates space for the \"better\" wingers? *(not saying creating space is an easy task btw)*. Do youth academies not care about producing world class strikers anymore, while every kid wants to become a winger like prime LM10/CR7? Even if you look at the most hyped youngsters, you have Yamal, Endrick, Zaire-Emery, Cubarsi, Mainoo, Yoro, Arda Guler, Joao Neves, Savio, Scalvini etc. Only Endrick is a striker and even he often plays as a RW. \n\n**TLDR:** Most strikers in the 2024 Euro were awful, many teams in general seems to not rely on them for goalscoring anymore, even the upcoming generation of footballers doesn't seem that promising on the striker department.

    "all_comment_text": "I asked the same question a few months ago, why we have less world class strikers than before. \n\nIt‚Äôs just that wingers have become better at scoring goals and providing more goal threat than regular wingers that were playing more as a left and right midfielder.\n\nAll because of tactics that have changed over the years. It‚Äôs easier to stop a striker than someone with loads of space down the wing.\n\n&gt;why we have less world class strikers than before\n\nThere was a big shift in how players train with the Spanish national team's success back in 2008-2012. A way of playing that was heavily inspired by Pep's Barca, and suddenly everyone wanted to become Spain. Youth football and football training overall developed into using more small team training, which is good, but making runs and finishing is pretty much the only thing you can't learn in that type of playing. Players like Haaland did because he specifically practiced all that with his father.\n\nAnd we can see how a world-class striker like Haaland can be marked out of the game effectively in the modern day. 30 years ago, Haaland would have been a world beater, even in the biggest of games. We can see his pure quality when he is able to be unleashed, but in games against very good defences, he is quiet.\n\n&gt; He is quiet\n\n\nI‚Äôd phrase it differently. The world‚Äôs best decoy. 3 people are focussed on Haaland which shuts him down but enables like 3-4 others around him.\n\n\nHaaland being shut down is part of the tactics. Because if you don‚Äôt shut down Haaland you concede goals scored by Haaland, but if you do actually shut him down then the goals will be scored by someone else.\n\n\nDo you really think Pep starts a striker that wouldn‚Äôt even get near the ball if he‚Äôs ‚Äòshut down‚Äô if it didn‚Äôt provide other MASSIVE benefits.\n\nNow tell me why City hardly won any big games last season. Most times, it‚Äôs only one solid CB on him like Rudiger for example.\n\nThe thing is. He is still so dangerous, that taking him out of the game inadvertently creates space and opportunities for those around him.\n\nThus resulting in what the OP is mentioning.\n\nDefenders are better, tactics have stronger defensive structure, attacking players are taking on defensive duties more.\n\nidk if defenders are better.. wild take\n\nWhilst he can be marked out of the game for 90 mins, he still has that strikers instinct to know if a ball gets loose in the box he will be there to smash it in.\n\nNot many strikers around like that\n\n&gt;but in games against very good defences, he is quiet\n\nI mean, I know what you're saying, but this often is the case for any player and we pay more attention to it when it's the biggest stars. Iceland under Lagerb√§ck were masters of it for example, completely taking both Messi and Ronaldo out of their respective games against them.\n\nEven if he gets marked, he still creates a lot of space for everyone else because of the attention he gets \n\nMaybe the stats aren‚Äôt flashy, he still has a lot of impact on the pitch for his teammates\n\ncould that be more of a fault of Pep though? We rarely see City play vertical which is the environment that Haaland thrives in. Ofc though, Haaland's own 'downfall' has contributed to City's increased success so it's a worthy tradeoff\n\nBecause his hold up play and link up is not good enough. Even lukaku struggle to do this in the prem and would rather run in with the ball . Now most team will have 10‚Äôpkayers behind the ball and park¬†\n\nHaaland would be worse in previous gens\n\nBut Tiki-Taka is dead for some time. Even Barca who were the best at it stopped doing it some time ago. They even got Lewandowski, a classic striker.\n\nYou saw Tika Taka this world cup. Yes, Spain had a lot of wing play in their attacking play. But their domination in midfield, their world class ability with the first touch, ability to beat the press with their touch and dribbling, the accuracy of the passes that helped retain possession etc. it's all part of Tika Taka ball retention.\n\nRelevant how?\n\nYou need to understand what tiki taka is\n\nThat spanish team had world class strikers leading the spear tho. I think the emphasis changed around mid 2000s with the likes of Pires (Arsenal) and Ronaldo (MU) scoring 20 goals from wide position.¬†\n\nI wrote something similar a couple of months back but I  relation to the premier league, noting that of the traditional big six clubs (MC, MU, Arsenal, Chelsea, Spurs, Liverpool) it was now only really City that had a traditional   elite striker.  Comparing to the old days of Henry, RvN/Roomey, Drogba, Kane, Suarez, Aguero etc.\n\nYeah, but United replaced the elite striker position with fuck all and now we can't score for shit.\n\nWe literally beat city in the FA cup with Bruno and Mctominay playing as false strikers.\n\nYeah it took haggy last game of the season to finally understand brunos best position that is get close as possible to penalty box where his creativity and eye for goal could be useful.¬†¬†\n\nIt's drastic change in mindset across most leagues... 20 years back wingers were a ridiculed *British thing*.\n\nIt‚Äôs all about the dynamic trio upfront who can interchangeably switch positions and still fit each role.  The age of the big striker is dead.\n\nI think it's a combination of this and what op suggested. Current generations of strikers are not as good as past ones. Too much error. Lacking basic skills.\n\nLike other positions, nowadays it is expected to do more than the main function.\n\nGK: Expected to also be good with the feet\n\nCD: Be good with ball progression, pass and attack integration\n\nMC: The MD is rarer, nowadays it is usual to find an all around good, jack of all trades Mid.\n\nForwards: They have not only to score goals but also press, defend, pivot...\n\nI disagree on the midfield.\n\nMost teams look for a specialist DM and another more versatile player\n\nBut even the specialist DM is expected to be able to do something with the ball other than pass it sideways\n\nThere‚Äôs never been a time when a specialist DM was just a destroyer at the top level though, people just oversimplifying things when comparing to the modern game\n\nDavids, Souness, Keane, Petit, Rijkaard, Matthaus, Deschamps, Vieira were all incredibly talented players too\n\nClaude Mak√©l√©l√©¬†\n\nhello i am the fellow unsympathic german of this thread.   \nplease note, that if you dont have an √Ñ on your keyboard the proper german way of replacing it is ae.   \nso matth√§us becomes matthaeus.   \nthanks for being annoyed by me!  \ntill the next time!\n\nAh, I didn‚Äôt know that. Thanks!\n\nSure, but that was only at the *very* top. One step below that and I think the guy has a point.\n\nKant√© lately\n\nActually, a forward who can reliably receive and hold the ball up from deep-central passes can be an integral part of the attack by quickly distributing from their position and can play a \"pick-and-roll\" style attack.\n\nProblem is, very few forwards are dominant hold up players, especially with the size of CBs these days.\n\nits not pick and roll.. its give and go\n\nIn spanish we call it \"la pared\" or \"the wall\" because its like kicking the ball against a wall and have it come back to you.\n\nbut for strikers its a lot more than that. the changes the GK role went through probably comes second, but a GK still has the same role as they did 20 years ago. the problem for strikers though is that if they are expected to start being involved in the midfield, they can't then also be in the box waiting for crosses, or hang just around offside and then make that special run. and at that point you gotta ask the question why a striker is needed at all. and as OP pointed out, some clubs such as Real Madrid answer this question by saying that a striker isn't actually needed. that won't happen for the goalkeeper obviously.\n\ngo watch football again , strikers always pressed this is nothing new..\n\nLate stage Guardiola ball has collapsed the defense in/around the box so strikers don‚Äôt have space. Space is exploited on the wings farther up the field. Strikers now have to be more involved in pressing and dropping deep to support the buildup whereas before they were leading the line and had more space and fewer defenders close to them. Nowadays pure strikers have 4-5 opponents close to them in the final third whereas before it was more likely just the CB pair. This is also why main strikers are bigger like Haaland and Nunez because they can hold their own and compete with larger players which is a natural consequence of having less space in the box since they have to be able to withstand physical contact. Haaland, Nunez, Kane, Lewandowski, Giroud are all about the same size or even bigger than many CBs.\n\nPep guardiola ball right now uses a pure poacher style striker\n\nLewandowski is only 184cm ...\n\n[deleted]\n\nIndeed , but most CB's are +186cm/+85Kg .\n\nLewa used to be a physical beast at Bayern but not anymore .\n\nDirect result of an entire generation growing up watching Messi and Ronaldo ball out as wingers.\n\nA friend of mine made a good point that the academy system also has a big effect. Most players have a largely transferable set of skills. You can train central defenders and central midfielders with the same kind of routines, and you can train wide defenders &amp; wide midfielders (wingers) with the and routines. All those roles have broadly similar demands, just in different quantities¬†\n\n\nHowever there's two highly specialised positions, goalkeepers and strikers, which those routines aren't overly useful. Which is probably why you see both positions peaking later (early 30s rather than mid-late 20s), because it's not reliant on the players playing games and developing instincts rather than something you can train them to do.\n\nSpain won the euros in 2012 playing 6 midfielders up front, not even any wingers, football isn't becoming striker-less but good, well coached teams with talented players make it work with what they have, even though strikers weren't at the fore front this euros there's a reason spain always started morata and england kane and Belgium lukaku even if your striker isn't scoring if the player and the coach is good enough you can still use them to affect the game, come deep and hold up play and create space for other players like morata dud for spain and giroud for france in 2018. Also the best striker in the world (haaland) didn't play at the euros, lautaro was pretty influential for argentina in their copa win as waa alvarez in the last wc, look at how Brazil struggled without a number 9 for their wingers to work off of. So to answers your question no, while they aren't as many world class strikers in the game any more better teams and players to adapt to it better than others but teams are always going to want to have the \"target man\" type player in their team.\n\nPlenty of amazing strikers, none of which are part of teams that were in the Euros.  The issue is that many teams are not built around strikers anymore.\n\nI feel like player styles trail behind tactical trends. The vogue in the last few years was false 9 and creative forwards so that's what academies started producing. Now that has been superceded a return to proper strikers (see Liverpool buying Nunez and man city buying haaland). The problem is these players aren't readily available. The meta is changing and we won't see the result until probably next euro.\n\nFar less than during the 2000s and it shows when you see how much someone like Morata has cost throughout his career. \n\nNot just a euros thing either. Brazil in copa America, Uruguay have Darwin who can‚Äôt hit a barn door and still Suarez. Just Argentina seem blessed with strikers who are maybe overvalued due to the lack of strikers now\n\nWell Kane is undeniably amazing, he was just injured. It‚Äôs like everyone has forgotten he has been scoring goals for fun forever\n\nKane has never won a trophy lol\n\nGod, you lot are boring at this stage.\n\nAs if that‚Äôs the sole definition of a great player. Plenty of pretty average players have won them.\n\nI tell you what, would you rather have a fully fit Morata or a fully fit Kane. Most people take Kane. (No hate on Morata, he had a brilliant tournament and is much maligned but it‚Äôs an obvious example of a good but not amazing player who has recently won a trophy).\n\nWell yah..thats the issue..evryone want their strikers to play behind and defend and use that space to wingers to attack into it..meanwhile strikers used to attack infront of empty spaces earlier..football tactics transforming recently..where everyone is looking for striker who can fall back and play as a false 9..\n\nSchranz is a winger, Slovakia‚Äôs strikers were Strelec and Bozenik\n\nI recently listened to a podcast featuring a panel of professional footballers and coaches. They concluded that even small nations and clubs now defend at a previously unthinkable level. This ability to neutralize teams relying on a single target player has forced coaches to innovate, involving wingers more in attacking play. Examples from the discussion even highlighted how teams like Iceland at Euro 2016 and smaller clubs in national leagues have achieved success against stronger opponents through disciplined defensive work and tactical adjustments.\n\nThere's no fool in football no more\n\n[r/SuddenlyCaralho](http://reddit.com/SuddenlyCaralho)\n\nYeah this is what my answer to this question is. Defenses have become much more compact and disciplined. As a result strikers have to drop back to create space behind them. \n\nSince you need to break that compact defense you need wingers to be more prominent to spread the defense. As a result wingers now have to be more creative and are encouraged to dribble inside more and attack the defense directly. It forces the strikers to work more in the build up play or to do dummy runs to pull defenders out of position.\n\nIf you have fitter more disciplined defenders, a striker needs to work more and further away from goal to be able to create space. \n\nThis has been the tendency for a while now as more and more strikers become jack of all trades and become much less conventional 9s with good examples being Suarez and Ag√ºero. Those are likely going to be the rule more and more as opposed to the exception with traditional 9s being phased out more and more.\n\nDo you rember what podcast or episode it was?\n\nExactly space has greatly been reduced in the box. At times you might have 10 defenders in the box defending the goal\n\nThanks for the detailed write-up.\n\nMy two cents to add is the lack of service due to the proliferation of inverted wingers. I will argue that having inverted wingers reduced both the number (or percentage) and quality of crosses. By the time the inverted winger takes the ball to his strong foot for crossing, the defenders are already better organized. Either there is no point in making the cross at that point (so the cross is not made, resulting in the number being lower) or it will be an ineffective cross because the defense is tight.\n\nYes, inverted wingers score goals by approaching and shooting with their stronger foot, but the service to strikers has been dismal.\n\nUnrelated, but I must say this: Endrick is not your typical striker if you consider his physique. Also, historically, Brazillian football does not have many \"traditional\" strikers - point man like your Van Nistelrooy's, Van Basten's, Batistuta's, Crespo's, Lucatoni's, Benzema's, Klose's, Voller's, Giroud's, Trezeguet's, etc.\n\nGreat take!\n\nI could actually see this problem in the Portugal NT with the stubbornness of Martinez to field Rafa Le√£o(Rfoot) on the left instead of Neto(Lfoot). Not only that, but the Wingers, Le√£o and Bernardo were not going into the box to receive balls leaving Ronaldo alone with sometimes Bruno getting in as part of his CAM routine.\n\nSo yes. We can definitely blame the crossers for the shit crosses the strikers were getting.\n\nThe problem is that Leao has also been playing on the left with Milan\n\nCity won the premier league without a striker one season.\n\nAnd Spain won trophies by playing fabregas up front.\n\n*trophy\n\nwithout Torres they don‚Äôt win Euro 08\nwithout Villa they don‚Äôt win WC 10\n\nBy that point wasn‚Äôt villa an inside forward? So more of a winger that cuts in.\n\nNope that was once he signed for Atleti at the end of his career. He was a striker during the WC. And one of the best in modern football history, incredible player.\n\nReal Madrid did the same this past season\n\nVinicus was playing striker for majority of the games\n\nThey also won the premiere league with Haaland as a striker and the Champions league.\n\nCity doesn't really proof the point of no striker beeing better.\n\nNo one is trained to be a ‚Äú9‚Äù anymore, everyone has to be involved in the play, everyone has to play different positions now. Whenever I watch my brother play, he‚Äôs 10, you don‚Äôt even see one lad up top, they‚Äôre always moving around to different positions and it was pretty similar for me\n\nBlame Guardiola. False 9 Messi ruined the perception of what a central forward is supposed to do. Also, the thing is that the traditional #9 is too much of a one-dimensional role, in the modern game each player is supposed to do a little bit of everything: passing, pressing, finishing along with whatever their \"main\" job is.\n\n\"Ruined\" and \"supposed to do\" aren't things in football. People do what works. Strikers can have good games now without scoring, I don't think that's ruined anything. And the real purpose of every footballer is to help their teams win, not to score.\n\nWell by ruined I didn't mean it became worse, it has changed for sure. And the post is clearly talking about traditional number 9s, not modern 9s. Traditional 9s will absolutely have a bad game if they don't score, because they offer very little outside scoring. Look at Haaland. When he doesn't score a goal there's a good chance he'll be invisible, and will get a handful of touches over 90 minutes.\n\nI think the answer lies in many aspects that overlap:\n\n- there's fewer absolutely world class strikers overall, that's a trend. Won't elaborate, others have.\n\n- this euro saw many very deep defensive lines with few goals where the best teams were involved.\n\nBut the biggest factor i think is more an assembly of unique circumstances for the teams involved: it's not the strikers themselves that underperformed but their teams. I'm going to ignore the weaker teams, they got varying degrees of striker success but if we're looking at the lack of world class striker performance, let's look at the teams that got that potential.\n\n- Portugal. C. Ronaldo is years past his prime. If not for his nimbus, he'd be considered a very average player. And he's been playing in a very low quality league for the past season. So his performance or lack thereof actually not surprising. Ofc no one else in this team COULD have a world class striker performance cuz... well they didn't play much.\n\n- England and France. Same boat imo, they got the best 9ers in the competition but because their teams underperformed - imo mostly because their coaches favoured reactive low tempo tactics - the strikers really couldn't do much. Kane apparently was somewhat injured, Mbappe wasn't in great form all season, had an injury, wasn't fed many good chances AND isn't really a traditional striker anyways. To put it in numbers: France scored their first goal from play in the semis (OGs and penalty before) and England had among the lowest xG of any team, abysmal for a finalist. Low chance creation by team, no surprise strikers don't score.\n\n- middling teams like Denmark or Austria got decent strikers but the teams overall, while good, aren't world class and they got eliminated by much stronger teams. No super surprised their strikers didn't score 5 goals.\n\n- the big one imo, the best performing teams...dont have world class strikers. To name them, Germany and Spain clearly played the best football in the tournament and if not for meeting in the quarterfinals, I believe both would've likely gotten to the finals (though obviously both could've lost to boring high talent ultra defensive discipline teams like England or France). Anyway, Spain plays Morata... who is a really decent striker, no matter how much he gets critisied in Spain. But he isn't world class. He could've scored a few more, surely, but Spains game doesn't favour a target man tbh. Adapted from old high passing game, they now also got quick amazing wingers and Morata was more value in holding balls, creating room with sprints and participating in passing. As for Germany, we don't have any world class striker since the Klose/Gomez era. F√ºllkrug is a super nice guy and good enough for starting in Dortmund or other good teams but...wouldn't play at Bayern, Real or City. Havertz, while being a world class (potential) player, isn't a classic striker. Could've scored 1-2 more with a bit of luck and quality in the finish but... didn't. \n\n- final reason: the missing talent. Some of today's best strikers didn't play in the euro, because they're South American or play for small teams. Look at Haaland, one if not the best striker, but... Norway...\n\nKvaradona is a left wing.\n\nGenerally yes. In the game vs Portugal, when he got MOTM, he was a striker on a 442 formation. That's why I said:\n\n&gt;Kvaratskhelia). And even some of these guys are more false 9 kind of players that drift wide or drop back, not exactly your typical \"target man\".\n\nWhile the current generation may see a decline in standout traditional strikers, the evolution of wingers and midfielders into false forwards keeps the game dynamic. Still, the return of high-quality strikers, paired with a commitment to attacking play and fluid tactics, promises to elevate the entertainment factor in football.\n\nAre strikers awful or are defenders super good? Or do preferred fullbacks focus more on attacking, causing wingers to shine due to their lack of defensive skills?\n\nIt‚Äôs likely not either. Defending as a team has become more and more studied and analyzed so that now lower skilled teams are able to more easily neutralize attacking threats by plugging holes as a team. Adding to that, players are now fitter and are therefore able to recover faster and more consistently. Therefore talented strikers are having to go away from goal to drag defenders out of position to create space.\n\nTop 3 goalscorers in la liga were all strikers \n\nTop 4 in German bundesliga were all strikers\n\nTop 4 in serie A were all strikers \n\n4 of top 6 in Premier league were strikers \n\n\nEither way, you raise a super interesting point. Clearly, strikers still exist at the very top in club level, so why aren't they performing for country?\n\nOff topic, but I see someone's playing Football Manager.\n\nI've never really played it seriously, I was more of a FIFA fanboy back in the day, haha.\n\nThank Pep and his false 9.\n\n\nInteresting how 100% of the things wrong with football can be tracked to Pep Guardiola.\n\nPep isn‚Äôt the problem. His style of football with Messi as a false 9 was some of the most entertaining and exciting football ever. People would tune in to Barca games just to see that.\n\nThe problem is people trying to emulate that to lesser degrees. \n\nI know Reddit despises Pep but let‚Äôs not rewrite history to blame him for everything.\n\nI think this is some revisionist history because at the time people were complaining about tika-taka being extremely boring to watch (as much as I enjoyed seeing how it tore teams apart)\n\nWe‚Äôre not talking about Tika taka, we‚Äôre talking about Pep‚Äôs false 9s\n\nAnd people definitely turned the TV on to see Messi as a false 9\n\nI think the issue is that while Barcelona used the style to be beautiful and dynamic, the Spanish national team used it to bore you to sleep. Having a midfield three of Busquettes, Xavi and Iniesta is using possession and control to create dynamism. Having a midfield three of Busquettes, Alonso and Xavi is using possession and control to grind the game to a halt. Barca also played actual wingers as well as Dani Alves as basically an extra winger while Spain played central midfielders in the wide midfield/winger areas.\n\nIf you have Messi, you're going to use him to the best of his abilities. It would be silly to take Messi and tell him to sit on the last defenders and not get involved with the buildup play. We've seen at City him opt for more poachers in Aguero and especially in Haaland and not just that, but instructing Haaland to play even more as a poacher than he did at Dortmund where he would involve himself with the buildup play significantly more than he does now. If people just look at Pep's Barcelona and the takeaway is you should use a false nine and not, you should use players in the way that they are most effective, they took the wrong lesson.\n\nWhat wrong is there is no coach creative enough to change the way football is played the way Pep has.\n\njust because he built a system to the utmost perfection that it‚Äôs working like clockwork, doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs actively destroying the sport lol. he‚Äôs just revolutionizing it, and people who aren‚Äôt tactically as capable will obviously focus more on defending to cope with the system.\n\nRevolution isn't always good. In this case, its pretty bad, because he happens to have the pieces to win.\n\n\nAnd when he wins, people copy him, and copying a system that is bad for the sport can only make it worse...\n\nRobot football\n\nI swear people who say this don‚Äôt actually watch the games lmao. \n\nPep‚Äôs city play incredibly fluid football with positions and formations constantly changing depending on the situation. Pep with a Messi false 9 was some of the best football to watch ever.\n\nThe ‚Äòrobot football‚Äô comes from teams trying to emulate it without the players with the ability to make those on the fly adjustments\n\nI think you're misunderstanding the term robot, i know exactly what city do, they are incredibly well drilled to the point they know almost every scenario on the pitch.\n\nBoring at times in my opinion as it comes at the cost of individual expression.\n\nYou seldom see a city player go off script and do something you haven't seen before or something unexpected. If they do and it doesn't come off Pep goes mental at them.\n\nYou may enjoy pass, pass, pass football. \n\nI find it incredibly boring\n\nHe literally has three plays:\n\n\nPass to the wingers to cross in the box to Haaland.\n\n\nWinger or Foden cut inside and cross shot, after 846 passes around the box\n\n\n\nInfiltration from fast winger after the CB fucks up marking.\n\nThis comment is just proving that you don't watch the games mate.\n\nAlso \"pass to wingers and cross to strikers\" is the exact gameplay this whole thread is complaining about being missing lmao. That's not playing with a false 9, that's how you play with a real striker. You're contradicting yourself.\n\nHow can you complain about Pep's false 9s being the problem, but then complain when he plays with a real striker receiving crosses?\n\nHow many teams played with either multiple strikers or with a striker that was really the main focus? Most teams played with two wingers that were the main offensive focus as well as defensive schemes built to primarily defend against opposing strikers. It‚Äôs not necessarily that strikers have become worse players, but more so that they aren‚Äôt put in a position to succeed tactically. \n\nGermany usually brought in Fullkrug who performed very well overall, so I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs necessarily that strikers aren‚Äôt useful. Most teams aren‚Äôt using them as effectively as before, which is more of a problem. Maybe trainers will prefer systems with better striker performance at some point, so things could change in the future.\n\nMy biggest euro regret is that i didn‚Äôt get to watch more fullkrug. Maybe he benefitted from coming in late, but he actually did stuff.\n\n#9s and #10s are becoming extinct. I wonder if Messi and Ronaldo would‚Äôve reached the same heights if they started their careers in this era. It‚Äôs now all about playing into space, everyone playing a defensive role, and less independence. The game killed #10s around 2006ish (when the switch to two wingers started becoming commonplace).\n\nBet you Ronaldo would still be a winger(def retire earlier). And Messi would have been labelled a CAM and do the same he does.\n\nWell Messi started as a RW and played there for about the first 5 years of his career. It was Pep who experimented with moving him to his current CFish role. Messi wouldn‚Äôt reach the same heights if not for that stroke of genius by Pep.\n\nit was pretty boring yea. its more that, at some point the game is all about not loosing.   \nfans wont change though, and have to demand more attractive play\n\nits too easy for modern systems to completely negate a conventional strikers impact on the game. some of the best strikers right now will have close to single digit actions with the ball after 90 minutes. now imagine if that striker isn't one of the best strikers.\n\nYes, false 9 is an attacking midfielder these days number 10s becoming wide players\n\nIt's basically golden state warriors ball coming into football. Interchangeable attacking players.\n\nIt does seem like managers today have got it into their heads that they have to play 5 at the back with 2 defensive midfielders. The game is now heavily focused on defence and I hate it. As a Spurs fan I've seen this 'defensification' of football do nothing but fail in recent years and it makes me go feral with rage when we have great attacking options sitting on the bench begging to play in a 443 or something. It also makes games unbearably boring.\n\nHitting it from behind is always better\n\nThan again: Kane scored  36 goals in 32 games for Bayern.\n\nThe wheels on the bus don't go around and around because it's parked all the time.\n\nZero routines and offensive training do this. For most teams it's easier to just fall back and let the attacking team play a game of handball around the box.\n\nThe game has tactically evolved that‚Äôs all.\n\nI think the game play is more defense and less risky. Strikers tend to open up the space for the midfielders and wingers to score. Some players look like Giroud: cannot score at all.\n\nI don't think football is becoming (traditional) striker less. Looking at the 2 best teams in the Premier League, Arsenal and City it's very obvious that both Havertz and Haaland act as a focal point for the play. The ball gets played into their feet, they use their strength to push off CB's and quickly recycle the ball elsewhere, potentially opening up pockets of play. Plenty of teams still played with a traditional ST, Liverpool with Nunez, Roma with Lukaku, Napoli with Osimhen, Milan with Giroud, Chelsea with Jackson, Leverkusen with Boniface, Bayern with Kane and countless others.\n\n  \nInternational football should never be taken too seriously as to the trends of football as it's a entirely different ball park. We definitely saw very interesting innovations at the Euros like Switzerland employing a inverted wingback [https://www.youtube.com/shorts/1PKOrI-mnMI](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/1PKOrI-mnMI) and I think Italy playing both Calafiori and Bastoni together (2 left footed CB's is quite odd). Especially with the rise of Pep's system which I believe is called JDP, being positionally rigid requires a focal point like a Havertz or Haaland. We definitely are not seeing traditional strikers die out but rather a drop in quality of strikers. Perhaps it was just a extreme example of talent pool but we had Falcao, Kane, Suarez, Lewandowski, Benzema, Aguero, Higuain, Zlatan, Cavani etc. during the 2010's. It's a ridiculously talented bunch of strikers and we are not seeing anything near the same right now and I have no idea why. We are also seeing a decline in a lone 6, it's just that football fluctuates and while we may be seeing a decline right now, nothing suggests we won't see a surge in talent yet again in the 2030's.  \n\n  \nBut yeah, looking at a team like Spain for example, Morata did have a great start at atleti this season then petered out a bit but I can see why de La Fuente decided to optimize Yamal and Nico. Morata is familiar with this false 9 set up for Spain so it all makes sense. I think Morata is also subbed off early as he works his socks off and he's probably one of the first to be exhausted in the game. \n\n&gt;  \nKane, Havertz, Mbappe (when he played as a #9), Depay, Lewandowski, Kolo Muani etc. scored\n\nI think that's unfair on a few of the players. Kane was playing through injury and England were poorly coached and optimized throughout the tournament. Same story for France and Netherlands, the attacking dynamics were fucked, France for example playing a midfield of Rabiot, Kante and Tchouameni does not help matters at all. The Netherlands not having any significant 1v1 wide threats or width holders to draw attention away from the middle, congesting the middle and making it hard to play through again did not help matters. Lewandowski I believe only made one appearance as he was injured for the first 2 group games. \n\n  \nBut again, I don't believe that football is becoming striker less, perhaps the role of the striker is changing from the traditional we've seen for so long but it's not becoming striker less.\n\nThe reason is that a smart winger is better than a dumb striker. \n\nWhich means a smart winger can dribble, he can create opportunities, he can realize opportunities himself. Vinicius, Rodrygo, the Spaniards, Saka, Musiala - they are multi-talented, so to say. \n\nOn the other hand, a striker that just waits for the ball and finishes is just not good enough anymore. Better a winger that can do much and is an okay striker than a good striker that can‚Äôt do anything else.\n\nThe world needs a blue lock project üòî\n\nIt's all cyclical, strikers will come back in vogue as a reaction to systems now\n\nDefense and goalkeeping got a lot better. There is space for true strikers, but they must excel at scoring goals and participate in defensive play as well, mostly as an advanced marker.\n\nI see a lot people speculating, and mentioning attacking players are expected to do more and so on, but no one's really mentioning HOW it became like this. \n\nThere was a big shift in how players train with the Spanish national team's success back in 2008-2012. A way of playing that was heavily inspired by Pep's Barca, and suddenly everyone wanted to become Spain(and Barca for that matter). Youth football and football training overall developed into using more small team training, which is good, but making runs and finishing is pretty much the only thing you can't learn in that type of playing. Players like Haaland did because he specifically practiced all that with his father.\n\nI would argue there was a second evolution of that with Klopp's Liverpool, which, while it certainly didn't create pressing, made pressing both far more aggressive and more ubiquitous, both within a team and across teams. You see now not just the top teams pressing, but smaller teams are starting to find success on a higher level by playing a more aggressive pressing style. Forwards (and all players really) need to be less static and more capable of regularly hounding defenders and pressing out of position and across the field to quickly win the ball back. This leads to the success of unconventional strikers like Firmino, who was by no means a classic number 9.\n\nYes, but it's different in the way that there wasn't a huge switch in how trainings were set up from youth football and up.\n\nThat's a good point. Guardiola's influence was far more systemic and fundamental to all levels, where as gegenpressing was more limited as a tactical innovation\n\nIt's funny that 4-4-2 is fashionable again\n\nA good observation. I wonder if this has anything to do with the fact that we witnessed - what I personally felt at least - horrible finishing in the tournament by teams (except maybe the first week).\n\nHot take, the VAR and stricter offside lead to this. Nowadays even 1 mm is enough to have goals canceled, so defenders have so much advantages compared to strikers that a 9 is just not that effective anymore and teams have started working around that problem.\n\nWith the upcoming new offside rule where attackers can be 99,9% past defenderd and still be onside, we will see a big resurgence of traditional strikers.\n\nHot take, the VAR and stricter offside lead to this.

SEMƒ∞H KILI√áSOY #9\n\nIt could also be a fluke. Lukaku had what? 3 goals canceled on very very close calls. \n\nKane was injured and playing like a cdm for some reason.\n\nMbappe was definitely not at 100% after the nose thing. Plus france struggled to even score one goal in open play.\n\nRonaldo is old and washed and should not be playing full games. \n\nSome other strikers didnt score because their teams just didnt score much at all anyways.\n\nThere is probably a trend but I think that luck plays a huge part in this. Tired players, terrorist football by teams like france and england that made it far into the tournament and just very deep defensive lines by many teams. \n\nSame thing when we look at previous years stats.\n\nLook at kane in the WC2018 . He had a hat trick vs puerto rico and it included a goofy deflection off the back of his boot. Yet he had 6 goals and he had a good world cup if we just look at the total number of goals.\n\nBut even in euro 2012 the top scorers had 3 goals some strikers and some not. I think its too chaotic to make such statements.\n\nI think the defending and style of positional set up has made the game much more tactical and so you can‚Äôt just drop in a crazy striker like you used to be able to do before. Like one, incredible player, could have sometimes just destroyed a whole team. Now, because of how things are planned and set up you won‚Äôt see that as often. \n\nIt‚Äôs made games more predictable, less spontaneous and therefore less exciting for the average viewer.\n\n\n\n&gt;In general, there were so many poor performances from strikers in the recent Euro: Ronaldo, Lukaku, Scamacca/Retegui, Hojlund, Thuram, Sesko, Dovbyk etc. all failed to score a single goal. Morata scored only once in 7 games and was probably Spain's least important starter.\n\nLets start with a simple question: \"How many world class strikers we have now?\"\n\n- I dont consider Scamacca, Retegui, Hojlund, Thuram or Morata to be world class. Just \"solid\". \n- Ronaldo is 39 years old and wont be on top forever.  Lewandowski is only slightly younger at 36. \n- Havertz, Depay or Mbappe are not really strikers, more like wingers or false 9s.\n- Kane scored 3 goals, which is still a pretty good score for this tournament.\n- This leaves us with Lukaku and Dovbyk just had bad tournaments. Happens. \n\nConclusion: we just lack world-class starters now. \n\nMy personal opinion is that, it's because of what you teach kids. Around 2000 Germany drastically changed kids training, focusing on dribbling and passing, instead of finishing and physical play (after they were eliminated in Group Stage of Euro 2000 and physical play and lack of dribblers was blamed for it). That's why they had loads of great offensive midfielders and wingers in recent years: Musiala, Wirtz, Havertz, Sane, Gnabry, Kroos, Ozil, Muller, Reus, Gotze, Gundogan etc. At the same time they didn't bring up any world-class striker. The last really good strikers were Miroslav Klose and Mario Gomez, which were born in 1978 and 1985 respectively, so they were trained before that reform. \n\nI don't know about other countries but I guess it looked similar. This was later fueled by Spain winning Euro 2012 with 6 midfielders and no striker, as well as Barcelona playing Messi at false 9.\n\nDoes COPA performances reflect this?\n\nI have some simple opinions\n\n- tap in isn't as simple as it seems, nor always. It demand positioning\n\n- some strikers work a pivotal role for the offensive plays. Benzema was good at it, Lukaku was also meant to be (guy is just a mess last years). When this happen, wingers or even mid-offense (Kaka, for example) make the goals\n\n- in general, I agree with you, but I take care to not be hurrying conclusions. Lautaro is a striker and was the top scorer in Copa America\n\nDont think anyone said it here but, defense are also getting much better. We have now tall, swift and fast defenders on every posts. Now, it's getting harder and harder to score a goal. \n\nOn club level, just look at how much money you have to spend just to get a striker that barely scores 15 goals a season now, it's madness so i'm not surprised if a lot of team try now not to play with one and find others solutions.\n\nCruyff always said the only way he'd player a striker in his XI is if that striker is the best in the world.\n\nPep is a student of this school of thought, as seen with tactics pre and post Haaland\n\nFootball changed. It's never been this structured and team-based. A team simply can't afford to have one player that's not involved in plays, with or without possession. You have to be out of this world as a pure striker, like Halaand or Lewandoski, with the current state of affairs.\n\nDefinitely agree overall. One of the biggest factors that causes this I think is how teams defend nowadays. My biggest tactical takeaway from this Euros was that every team defended with 11 men in their own half and focused strictly on maintaining constant structure and tight gaps in defense. This is completely opposite to how teams defended 15 years ago, especially at the international level where the game was much more end to end and free flowing. Overall teams are more structured on both sides of the ball, meaning chaotic moments and transitions which strikers love are fewer and far between. \n\nThe knock on effect of this is that teams must be much more calculated and precise in their chance creation. Controlled passing, positional discipline, and the occasional set piece is how teams create chances now rather than relying on chaotic balls into the box for a striker to win a low percentage battle. \n\nThis means that highly technical, agile, and creative players are relied on more and more in attack rather than a striker who relies on their physicality and instinctive finishing in the box. Unless you literally have Erling Haaland (who even then might not even suit City as well as Alvarez) a team is much better off in a controlled slower paced game with another technical 10 style player than an out and out striker. Chances that suit traditional strikers are less and less common, while chances that suit attacking midfield type players are becoming more and more common. When a team needs a big physical presence in the box for set pieces and such, they usually usually rely on CDMs or CBs (separately teams are fielding up to four CB style players at a time now) which provides the same physical presence as a striker for those situations without reducing a team‚Äôs effectiveness during open play.\n\nNo, National football develops a bit slower than Club football. Club football used to be very heavily dependent on wingers in high levels. Right now it is renaissance of strikers, give it 2-6 years national teams will heavily utilise them\n\nGood write up. The game has definitely changed from the old generic 442 451.\n\nI think it has to do with the amount of games tha athletes has to perform at. There're way more torunaments and leagues so I'd think that everyone is trying to save some energy by playing conservative. \n\nWorld cup ( + qualifications)\n\nNations league\n\nEuro (+qualifications)\n\nCountry league (premier, bundes liga etc..)\n\nChampions League or UEFA Europa league (or their local one like for south america or sth)\n\nso yeah fatigue is a commonplace between football players.\n\nWe‚Äôre barely 12 months removed from City winning the treble and Haaland scoring 50 goals along the way, I think striker-less might be a slight overreaction.\n\nI feel like it's just the current \"metagame\" in football that strikers play in more of an \"I'm a massive threat, deal with me\" positional role, forcing defenders to conform to their movement and free up space for midfielders to do all the goalscoring\n\nIf anything I think it's a sign of lots of fairly-high-quality strikers. Teams are forced to stifle them and that leaves them vulnerable to the midfield\n\nAdmittedly I'd agree that there aren't any REALLY incredible strikers around right now - if there were they'd probably produce a different metagame because containing them might be impossible and teams would switch back to trying to stifle them of midfield service instead\n\nIn 10 years there will probably be another shift as tactics and counterplay to this approach develop and we'll see something else happen for a while\n\nI saw an opinion where most players you see today grew up around Ronaldo and Messi time, so they want to be more like wingers than actual strikers\n\nWingers nowadays play inside forward and they use righ footed on the left and left foot on the right and fullback crossing the ball much less than before. If you look at team like Man united last season, they have no place for striker. Ironically Pep's Man city did a lot of crossing.\n\nI think the academies killed the strikers. Homogenization of football\n\nIt's  increasingly a numbers game .1 striker is a single goal threat playing 1 v 2 with the CBs vs which is easy to nullify. 2 goal scoring wingers offer a double goal threat either side of the strikerWhich varies the attack and creates 1v1 scenarios across the backline\n\nCamarda?\n\nIt's harder to mark three/four players out of the game than it is one.\n\nThe old 4-4-2 worked when the two strikers worked in partnership, one dragging the defenders away from the other.\n\nBut as teams focused on the midfield battle for possession and everything changed towards a 1 up top model, the opposition became able to counter the lone goal scoring threat more easily. This meant the players behind him had to pick up the baton - gradually evolving to the model you're describing today.\n\nThat's my theory anyhow.\n\nscoring a tap in doesn't count against you, it's something strikers are supposed to do\n\nEverybody copies tactics. When Messi and Ronaldo peaked, they were playing as wingers. Obviously each and every club was supposed to play in a style that made wingers excel. It's as old as football itself. \n\nYears ago, you always had a left-footed player as a left winger, and a right footed player as a right winger. Cruijff switched them during his Barcelona managing days, and all of a sudden every right footed winger started playing left and the other way around. \n\nNot sure who once started with backs that just ran up and down the field as wingbacks, but we've seen that occur more and more too. Guardiola started with backs that position themselves a bit more in the center as an extra midfielder, and guess what you saw during the Euros.\n\nMoyes didn't want strikers just midfielders the most boring season I've ever watched at West Ham\n\nFootball is becoming footballless...no fantasy very tactic\n\nWell, ‚Äúwingers‚Äù today are playing AML/AMR, so they‚Äôre not as deep as wingers of my day. Being able to invert is also important.\n\nFootball is definetely changing but i don't believe it will become striker-less. This generation of strikers is just crazy worst then the previous one. Only new generation strikers worth watching are probably Osimhen, Haaland and Lautaro.\n\nGreat analysis, thank you.\n\nFootball has no more wingers and no more strikers. Right now the only strikery striker is haaland and wingers mbappe, vini (sometimes) and high potential barcola and nico williams\n\nSerious question; Didn't Georgia use Kvaratskhelia as a striker in the Euros? I think they were playing 4-4-2 with Kvaradona and Mikautadze at the front? Just asking because I'm not sure.\n\nI brought this because I actually agree with you, pretty much that's how Georgia was playing; instead of using natural CFs they were using two wingers and attacking by cutting inside, a lot of teams are playing like that or as you say, using a false 9 like Germany with Musiala or the Netherlands with Depay.\n\nIn 2012, the highest goal scorers had 3 goals each and they were like only three. Torres won it\n\nWe do not have less world class strikers. Managers expect attackers doing different things.\n\nWe used to have figo as a worldclass winger. He scored 8 goals a season or so.\n\nModern wingers score like old school strikers. Wich makes the striker get the task of dropping deeper to set them up.\n\nIt started with Wenger &amp; Henry. Wenger bought Henry as a winger and converted him back to a striker. Starting from Henry (and subsequent Wennger's attempt to replicate Henry), we start to see winger-strikers (as compared to the conventional in-the-hole forward such as Bergkamp) in the premierleague.  \n\nHenry, Van Persie, Wiltord, Reyes, Theo Walcott, Rooney, CRonaldo, Giggs, Kalou  etc  \nAround the same time, Rijkaard's Barcelona also pioneered 4-3-3 formation with the likes of Giuly, Ronaldinho, Messi etc  \n\nRight now 442 is completely out of favour and variations of 433 dominate the meta. A lone out and out striker is easily marked and prevented from scoring, so the role evolved into stretching and creating more spaces for the wingers and midfielders to score.\n\nStriker has been an outdated term for a while. Modern football is far too fluid for such static terms.\n\nDuring the last world cup and the euro tournament, I so wanted to make a video of Harry Kanes play.  I can record and watch TV on the computer.  I wanted to put it to the Scorpions song \"Rock You Like a Hurricane\" (But say Harry Kane).  I've not been able to get any exciting footage of him.\n\nYes, classic strikers like we had in the past are impossible to see in teams nowadays. Everything is based on tactics and nothing on pure inspiration and skills.\n\nThat‚Äôs true,we need more¬†\n\nThe position has changed. There are no true number 9s anymore. Everybody plays a zone type of defense and strikers are expected to play as wingers. The goal poaching Inzaghis and Batistutas are gone. I‚Äôd say the last true great number 9 of this generation has been Lewandowski.\n\nI agree. Its the wingers who have developed the ability to score more goals from sides and even dribble towards centre and then score from there.\n\nThe fault it's from Guardiola and Football became boooriiiing. Even Rooney said that.\n\nthat‚Äôs what i have realized\n\nWe‚Äôll barely any goals we‚Äôre even scored this tournament so ti isn‚Äôt surprising . Boring defensive football\n\nThey will find the hardway... City just won 4 in a row, 2 of them with a big 9 upfront, Joselu for RM, Kane etc the goalpoast haven't moved, but tacticos can do whatever they want in between.\n\nfootball just lacks strikers and it‚Äôs been a long problem for last 4-5 years\n\nMessi scored 0 goals unless you count a tiny unintentional deflection\n\nAh yes, that is not a goal now.\n\nThere was a plethora of great goalscorers in the past, however, many of them were only really good at that. Strikers now are expected to help more and be more included in the game. I like to say some strikers today are a hybrid of a winger. Of course that‚Äôs not to say there aren‚Äôt great finishers today it‚Äôs just‚Ä¶. Tactics have changed I guess.\n\nI mean if you think about the best team in the world has a striker in Haaland, Real Madrid needed to bring on Joselu (a striker) to win against Bayern, and Spain who have Morata (be it not a ‚Äúreal‚Äù striker) literally won the Euros.\n\nA lot of teams are going striker-less but they‚Äôll soon realize that you NEED a striker to win.\n\nI think it's more about needing a certain type, who helps the other players perform more.¬†\n\n\nPreviously the argument was \"Is the striker getting the service\", whereas now the question is, \"How did the Striker help in the build up?\"\n\n\nI don't think the idea of a striker can ever truly die. I think teams will always want someone who can win a header in the box, or stretch defences with pace etc, but it will probably move more and more towards a striker needing build up play first, pure scoring ability second.\n\nAgreed, I still think teams who lack a striker presence will suffer. \n\nAston Villa have Watkins for example as well, who was England‚Äôs only real threat (him and Toney) in the Euro‚Äôs. Both strikers\n\nExactly, teams will always need that certain dynamic they bring, but I think the days of pure elite poachers like Van Nistelrooy or Falcao are long gone.\n\nLautaro come on in extra time off the bench to win the copa for Argentina\n\nList goes on and on I love it\n\nBut if you ask some random Spanish fans \"which is the worst/least important starter for your team\", more than 90% of them would say Morata. Same goes for the Joselu example, yes he had an amazing game vs Bayern (also some other clutch moments throughout the season), but no fan/manager would pick him over the likes of Vini, Mbappe, Rodrygo, Brahim, Bellingham etc. in the starting line-up.\n\nTraditional strikers are always gonna be important, but they're simply not AS important nowadays. Can you imagine 02 Brazil without Ronaldo?\n\nIdk, Morata was heavily involved in the build up in most of Spain‚Äôs goals and he was great at holding down the defensive line.\n\nThought he was also replaced by Oyarzabal who did the same thing, so it could just be how good Spain are as a unit tbh\n\nI definitely agree that Striker were more important back then, but like you said. Strikers will always be needed. \n\nYou need someone to be in that box, to cause some chaos or just get a defender off focus for a bit. Think of how Scamacca was in the Europa final, kept the Leverkusen defenders on their toes and opened up more opportunities for Lookman.\n\nWell if they wanted to live one they should've learnt how to actually keep possession and create chances too. Fielding a player who cant do that while benching another player who can is like playing with 10men\n\nStrikers are actually coming back into the meta again.  Even Havertz, who isn't a typical striker is still built like a striker.\n\nThe Low Block is choking any productivity from strikers out. Vote for the daylight rule.\n\nThe daylight rule will cause even more low blocks. You can't play a high line if it's all of a sudden much easier to get in behind while remaining onside.\n\n3 years ago watching the euros I thought Harry Kane was shit and needed to go. After watching this euros, my opinion remains unchanged but all I can think is how great those suckjobs he's giving Gareth are, how else could he possibly stay in the starting lineup being so shit\n\nPep ruined the game"

It is also why they are so frequently participating in the UEL, the slow start makes it tough for them to finish in the top 4, and it often means they don't qualify through to the R16 of the UCL if they had qualified the previous year.\n\nIt is weird but it is a frequently recurring pattern for a long time.\n\nIts not random, they targeted UEL as their primary competition, since they don't have good UCL campaings and the adversaries are very hard, so they decided to be a Real Madrid of the UEL and make history this manner.\n\nIf Real Madrid win Champions league then they tie the Premier league combined haul.\n\nThat's the most incredible stat imo\n\nI just realised they already have more than the entirety of Italy combined, 14 to 12\n\nCrazy stat but no offence to La liga, am I correct in saying that only Real Madrid and Barca have ever won the champions league? \n\nIn history has any other Spanish team won it besides just these two?\n\nCorrect - Atletico have reached 3 finals (narrowly losing to Madrid twice under Someone) and Valencia made two finals in a row in 2000 and 2001, getting hammered by Madrid in the first and then losing to Bayern on penalties in the second. \n\nLa Liga are incredibly dominant in Europa though.\n\nThe EPL is only about 30 years old though.\n\nIt‚Äôs English clubs in general\n\nTo win 7 Europa but only 1 super cup feels so wrong\n\nWhen u understand that they play the winner of the UCL in the Super Cup, its actually impressive...\n\nValencia and Atleti: hold my beer\n\nAtletico is actually kinda cracked. Won 3/3 times against reigning UCL champs as a team that competed in the UEL the previous season\n\nAy anyone remember Diego Costa kicking Ramos in the head in their last Super Cup encounter?\n\nIs it though? It's not like we're talking about teams from completely different tiers here.\nSure the UCL winners are obviously a very strong team, but it feels more like bad luck for Sevilla here.\nIt's not like they're getting completely destroyed in these matches either, they lost in extra time the last 4 times they were in the super cup.\n\nEverything you have said only makes what they've done seem more impressive. Pushing the UCL winners to extra time? Not getting obliterated in under 90? Keep in mind, UEL winners have faced clubs like Madrid, Bayern, Barca, Milan, Inter, Chelsea, United, Liverpool, etc. And not in league game, but European finals, where these clubs typically play their best.\n\nWhere did I say it's not impressive? I said it seems wrong that they haven't won more\n\nWhat are you even talking about at this point? Can you quote where I said you called Sevilla unimpressive?\n\ndo either of you have basic reading comprehension?\n\nThey‚Äôre in the same league man shut up\n\nDid you accidentally reply to the wrong person? I do not understand what you are talking about\n\nYou did question if it was impressive though\n\n\"ancient times like 80s, 70s or 60s....\"\n\nLOLL\n\nBlud was born in 2015üò≠\n\n18 year olds were born in 2006 I was pretty sure the last year people were allowed to be born in was the Y2K baby boom and even that was controversial in my opinion\n\nYou mean to tell me there's literal adults that were not even born when the miracle of istanbul happened?\n\nNo\n\nI refuse it\n\nThey are all fake thank god we live in a simulation\n\nYeah I'm so glad I'm fake\n\nüíÄ\n\n1980 was almost half a century ago tbh\n\nHow dare you\n\nIn fairness, anyone under the age of 40 has faint memories of that at best‚Ä¶and the money, and therefore game, has completely changed since then‚Ä¶\n\nI mean 2050 is closer then 1990 is‚Ä¶\n\nAnd he says it backwards...'80s, '70s, and '60s.. üòÅ\n\nSerie A was super dominant from the late 1980s all the way through the 90s\n\nEnglish team won 6 in a row in the 70's  it's the natural waves of the game.\n\nIts cycles of domination\n\nBest league in the world this century for a reason. Epl could humble down and learn from them instead of crying \"luck\" and repeating their mistakes\n\nFor the money the premier league spend its the ultimate farmers league tbh.   You have one team who will spend more in a summer window than the entire La Liga, Bundesliga or Serie A combined. \n\nWhen you take into account the money spent the results in Europe are a pure embarrassment.\n\nSay what you want about Perez and his  Euro super league  BS  but when it comes to football administration he's definitely the G.O.A.T \n\nThey very rarely buy a flop and some of their best signings sign for practically nothing.    Tchoumeni,  Camavinga, Modric,  Valverde, and Bellingham, their whole star studded midfield  for what?  About 100 million pounds  in transfer fees total?\n\n\nIts also why West Ham fans need to be fairer to Moyes IMO.  Yes the football isn't great but they literally made an income this season on transfers.  They really have no right to be alongside Chelsea and Man Utd yet they are and some fans want to axe the manager?   If the league is spending well over 2 billion per window then finishing top half while spending negative is really a great achievement. \n\nGive him 100 million or 150 million in the summer and maybe the football will be better.\n\nI watched one of the worst players I've ever seen in the Scottish Premier League. Silva on loan for Rangers, offers absolutely zilch. Wolves paid ¬£36 million for him. Wolves!! Shocking the amount of money floating about these types of clubs.\n\nBeing aligned so well with the states really helps the epl. It‚Äôs easier to watch every EPL game than any other major domestic league stateside\n\nMadrid have a pull over players that money cant match. All the top players want to wear the white shirt.\n\n&gt; Tchoumeni,  Camavinga, Modric,  Valverde, and Bellingham, their whole star studded midfield  for what?  About 100 million pounds  in transfer fees total?\n\nTchouameni alone was like ¬£70mil. I seem to remember Modric being about ¬£30mil and that was 12 years ago.\n\nWasn‚Äôt Bellingham about ¬£90mil? I think Camavinga was ¬£25mil-¬£30mil.\n\nCouldn‚Äôt tell you an estimate of the wages but I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôre much higher than most English clubs pay.\n\nI agree with your overall point but let‚Äôs not act like Madrid don‚Äôt spend money.\n\nMadrid have an interesting wage structure - the stars off the pitch make a lot but guys like Marcelo and Carvajal for years we‚Äôre making way less than their PL contemporaries\n\nWhat lol that midfield cost a shitload more than 100m\n\nMoyes should have been sacked end of last season  lad. Yes, they won the conference league. They also finished 14th and were rotten all season. \n\nHe would have 100%% been sacked before the end of the season if they weren't still in conference league.\n\nIf I was West Ham, I'd be trying 1000% to get Potter. \n\nAlso, Moyes football will never get better. Can gold plate a pile of turd but it's still a pile of turd.\n\n&gt;¬†If the league is spending well over 2 billion per window then finishing top half while spending negative is really a great achievement.\n\nwhat teams you want bottom and mid table teams from epl to dominate Europe when most of them are not playing in Europe?\n\nCan't really call the PL a farmers league when they have had more different European Cup winners over the last few years than any other league. The fact that you supporr a team in a league with the same 3 finishing top, year in, year out makes your comment even more laughable. \n\nThe PL is also the most competitive in the world. Hardly a surprise that teams who play at 60% capacity most weeks *sometimes* outperform those who have to play at 100\n\n~~oil~~ premier league fanboys are always so funny hahaha\n\nIsnt city dominating epl almost as equal as psg is dominating french league and harder than real madrid or juventus dominste spanish/italian. That city too only managed to win 1 ucl so we can guess how dominant would real/bayern or any other top european club be in england. Reality is that epl is money, but apart from this year, it on average has 1 and a half good team per year. That half is usually liverpool before they lose every important game in last 2/3 months of the season\n\nSo competitive that City, the premium oil club, will make it 6 titles in 7 years this season.\n\nI suppose if you're a glory hunter (likely, given the sub I am posting in) and only look at the top of the table, then yeah, it can seem uncompetitive to someone who hasn't watched football all that much. \n\nIf you look beyond that, see we have had more different winners (5) in the last 12 years, different teams finishing in the top 4 rather than the exact same ones, just in a slightly different order, you'll see it's easily the most competitive top flight division.\n\nThe idea that the premier league is the best league comes from ratings and revenue. Result wise there's no really conclusive evidence for it being better than La Liga\n\nand coefficient‚Äôs, which is a truer indicator of all performers, not just the selected best. Which in the last 4 years the PL has led.\n\nReal Madrid and Barcelona dominating for a long time did not equate to the rest of the league being quality. For some reason people choose to take that as a swipe at Bayern, Madrid, Barca and Juve etc when reality is everyone knows they are/were quality, and in the group of best clubs in Europe, but that doesn‚Äôt equate to the entire league being similar. \n\nIf you stuck Madrid in the SPL, that wouldn‚Äôt suddenly make the league great. It‚Äôs still just a WC Madrid, Celtic/Rangers and then everyone else.\n\nEdit: correction for the pendants.\n\n&gt;and coefficient‚Äôs, which is a truer indicator of all performers, not just the selected best. Which in the last 7-8 years the PL has led.\n\nFirstly, it is the indicator of the selected best as only 7 or 8 teams perform in europe of 20? \n\nSecondly, I see you like to talk about the truth but the truth is that England has been on top of that ranking since 2021 so 3 years, not 7 or 8 years.\n\n&gt;If you stuck Madrid in the SPL, that wouldn‚Äôt suddenly make the league great. It‚Äôs still just a WC Madrid, Celtic/Rangers and then everyone else.\n\nI don't understand your point. Are you comparing the rest of the Scottish League to the rest of Spanish League? When teams like Atletico, Sevilla and Villareal have competed very well and beat English TOP6 teams to European trophies.\n\nWell 4 years, as they overtook at the start of the 2020 season. But no, you‚Äôre making an exaggerated comment that I‚Äôm not suggesting. \n\nSimply put, people take criticism of LL or Bundesliga as a criticism of their best teams as well. Even though they can co-exist as arguments.\n\nIf I hypothetically say ‚ÄúLL isn‚Äôt that good‚Äù the most common rhetoric would be ‚ÄúMadrid/Barca fucked PL clubs for years‚Äù, when no one is suggesting either of the two Spanish giants are bad. Atletico are a top, top side. But the other two, have basically only been relevant in the UEL in that 20 year period. \n\nWhilst Arsenal and Spurs didn‚Äôt win it, they at least reached the final alongside having 4 other English UCL winners in that time. Spain‚Äôs UCL dominance is literally just Barca/Madrid which is to be expected + an unlucky Atletico who probably deserved 1 themselves too.\n\nYou forgot Villarreal who has been to the semis twice, Valencia lost 2 finals... Besides Spain has 3 utlra top teams in Real Madrid, Barcelona, and Atletico plus medium top teams in Valencia, Sevilla, Villarreal, Celta Vigo, Athletic Bilbao and Real Sociedad.. Bilbao lost a UEL final and so did Espanyol.\n\nIf you mention the big 3 in spain as non-factor that is ridiculous lmao. If you even remove the trophies won by Real and Barca still Spain has more trophies then EPL with 17 trophies medium top teams in Spain go to work\n\nI didn‚Äôt include UCL semi‚Äôs because English clubs outside of the Top2 (Utd/Liverpool &amp; Madrid/Barca) have probably achieved that more anyway, and Valencia‚Äôs ‚Äú2 finals‚Äù fall outside of your own 20 year cut-off which is why they weren‚Äôt included.\n\nI mean if we want to just be frank we can even just use this year: look at the state of you. The PL hopes of anything this year lie upon the shoulders of *checks notes* Aston Villa, in the Conference league at that. \n\n3 German Teams in Champ/Europa\n\n1 Spanish team in Champions \n\n2 French Teams in Champ/Europa\n\n3 Italians in Europa/Conference\n\n1 English in Conference\n\nSo this ‚ÄúPL dominance‚Äù seems to not hold up to either past, or present\n\nOh no, the English league had an off year for the first time in like 6 years. Pretty sure you weren‚Äôt claiming Ligue 1 or Bundesliga as no.1 when they locked out the UCL semi‚Äôs in 19/20. Or when LL had only 1 representative left after the Qtrs in both European comps in that same year. \n\nJust dumb logic. You‚Äôd have a point if Newcastle or Man Utd were doing well in the domestic league as well but seeing as they‚Äôre struggling just as much in the league as they did the UCL the result seems about right.\n\n&gt;Oh no, the English league had an off year for the first time in like 6 years.\n\nIn comparison to la liga team, you had an off year this whole century. Check h2h, trophies and participation, la liga trumphs epl team in all of that even without real and barca. Likes of sevilla or villareal regularly beat man united, arsenal etc past few years. Epl has better brands, la liga has better teams\n\nOne year üòÇ. To show you how silly that is, the last time no English teams reached the semis, we had two all English finals in Europa and CL the next season.\n\nDidnt la liga have 2 or 3 times spanish ucl final and even eul final in the same time and has 4 or 5 times both cl and uel champions at the same time. In last decade or so it happened more than 50% of the time. Anyways, la liga beats epl in basically any stat in europe and thinking that mid teams in epl are better than mid teams in la liga is just being ignorant of the results\n\n&gt;But no, you‚Äôre making an exaggerated comment that I‚Äôm not suggesting.\n\n I'm pretty sure you did that by exaggerating the amount of years England has been top of the ranking by double the amount.\n\n&gt;If I hypothetically say ‚ÄúLL isn‚Äôt that good‚Äù the most common rhetoric would be ‚ÄúMadrid/Barca fucked PL clubs for years‚Äù, when no one is suggesting either of the two Spanish giants are bad.\n\nWell I don't care what they might think. What I think is that you are putting down other teams like Atletico, Sevilla, Villareal, Valencia, Sociedad etc.\n\nIt is a fact Barcelona &amp; Real Madrid are clear of any PL teams in last 20 years but also have a look at other Spanish teams:\n\nAtletico - 2x CL finals, 3x EL Winners\n\nSevilla - 7x EL Winners\n\nVillareal - 2x CL semi-finalists, 1x EL Winners\n\n  \nIs that much worse than Man City (also 2x CL finals but won one), Arsenal (1x CL final, 1x EL Final, 1x CL S/F) and Spurs (1x CL final)?\n\nThe only difference there for the teams outside the top 2 of both leagues is attitude towards the UEL. Probably due to the reputation carried forward from the UEFA Cup, no one wanted to even be in the tournament particularly for the 00s and 10s.\n\nSpanish football in terms of coefficient had started dropping after 2016ish. Strong results prior to that held them much higher than they were performing for a little while, and now they‚Äôve dropped off of the score they‚Äôre not likely going to finish the year in 2nd either. Most of us can agree that ‚Äúprime La Liga‚Äù was probably a decade ago now. \n\nNot sure why you removed Chelsea from that comparison but if you‚Äôre comparing 3-5th best performers then England has what, 3 UCLs, 2 UELs, 3 UCL finalists and 1 UEL finalist + the UCL S/F from Arsenal. So I guess ‚Äúwhat is better‚Äù is how highly you compare 6 extra Spanish UELs to the 3 English UCLs.\n\n&gt;No one wanted to even be in the tournament particularly for the 00s and 10s.\n\nYeah, and I can say Spanish teams don't want to be in the Conference League meanwhile PL is farming the points in there. In reality, Mourinho is still to this day showing off that he won Europa League with Man United, Liverpool were playing their strongest team before losing to Sevilla in the final and Arsenal wanted to win a European trophy even if it was Europa League.\n\n&gt;Spanish football in terms of coefficient had started dropping after 2016ish.\n\nThey completely outscored England in 16/17, slightly lost in 17/18 and then slightly won in 19/20. \n\n&gt;¬†So I guess ‚Äúwhat is better‚Äù is how highly you compare 6 extra Spanish UELs to the 3 English UCLs.\n\nOf course those English teams have a better trophy cabinet, but the difference is not as huge as the difference between the top2 Spanish teams and top2 English teams, so overall if you look at the top6 teams from each league LaLiga would come out on top in the last 20 years.\n\nBarcelona too would be the #1 21st century side at any other league. That speaks volumes and tells you everything you need to know.\n\nI know it‚Äôs more spread out at the Premier among the top, but that‚Äôs because Big 2 on Spain have really been so dominant. Funnily enough, it started to reverse and they got to experience that 2, occasionally 3 horse race since 2018 with City and Liverpool (and Arsenal lately), La Liga became closer and the Premier more top-2 heavy. And now they consider it the best league, because they naturally started getting the best results even though their league is more unequal than ever.\n\nAll discrepancies on perceived strength among the leagues come from this. People compare UCL different winners, or even domestic winners as if they were comparable. They‚Äôre not. Real Madrid is no City nor Porto. It‚Äôs a Big 2 *relatively* speaking. I‚Äôm pretty sure Dortmund has not been a better side than Atleti or even Sevilla especially for the last decade, just because it‚Äôs also been a traditional ‚ÄúBig 2‚Äù in Germany (even though you‚Äôve got a 3rd team on Leverkusen right now, but more occupying Dortmund‚Äôs vacant than anything, and you wouldn‚Äôt count Girona on La Liga just yet either, so still a Big 2 either way). It‚Äôs misleading vocabulary based on clubs sizes and not their performances.\n\nShouldn‚Äôt be downvoted, you‚Äôre quite right\n\nHe isnt at all. Just ignorant\n\nYour take is completely off England has lead the coffient for the last 3 years not 7-8 as you said and before that Spain lead for 9 seasons but that is not important because the Coffient doesn't say much and everyone can do that by taking the group games seriously example Brighton beat everyone in their weak group full of eastern european teams hence it doesnt give indication rather then collecting points from irrelevant Norwigian teams or estonian teams etc etc in the lower competitions which can inflates the Coffient\n\nOfcourse the co-efficient tells you a lot. Every single club is seeded, as Brighton aren‚Äôt very good in European football their co-efficient would have them face harder competition for their respective competition. Hence Newcastle in the group of death which was the exact opposite of stat padding, yet even they were one bad handball call away from knocking out the current semi-finalists out in the group stage.\n\nI mean if you actually watch the game is by far the best in my opinion. They might don‚Äôt have the best team of all but the overall quality is better. Idk if you watched the man city game vs Liverpool a couple weeks ago. I haven‚Äôt seen a match like that probably since the great Cl√°sico games.\n\nThe way I see it is that the Premier League is more fun to watch, due to the high level of athleticism and speed of the game paired with the technical aspect. However, La Liga is arguably as high quality as the PL, and demonstrably better in Europe. Also, the technical aspect in La Liga is, in my opinion, a bit higher quality than the PL. So, the leagues are generally equal in quality but the PL is better entertainment for many people and benefits from better coverage worldwide.\n\nIt‚Äôs not. You simply think it‚Äôs the best because Luton vs wolves can end up 5-5.\n\nI mean is better than a vallalodid vs Mallorca 0-0 or not ? . It not just my opinion , almost every important ex or actual player say the same thing. \nI don‚Äôt think the premier league have ever has a team as good as prime Real Madrid or Barca , maybe the closest is this city or the man utd with Ronaldo . But the team in general are much better and money is a big factor like everything in life .\n\nNo it‚Äôs not. Believe it or not, there‚Äôs more to football than just goals, however important they sre\n\nWell I think the premier league is the most competitive. But being the most competitive comes with drawbacks. If most of your domestic fixtures are not that competitive, it would make sense that you‚Äôd be more physically and mentally ready for European matches. I see La liga‚Äôs dominance in Europe not as a sign of its strength but actually its weakness.\n\nI mean Sevilla were in the relegation zone last year for most of the seasons but won the Europa league.\n\nHow do you gauge not that competitive? Both Sevilla and Villarreal are in the bottom half of the table\n\nWell, whenever I read interviews with players comparing La liga with the EPL, they seem to indicate that weaker teams in the EPL keep going even when they are losing while weaker teams in La liga just accept the loss and enter into damage control. So in terms of physical and mental intensity, it would seem that the EPL would be more demanding. League position was irrelevant to my point.\n\nHow about Italy‚Äôs World Cup performances in that time too!\n\nThis was the Golden age of Spanish Football. The national team also won 3 major tournaments in that time. For those that remember before that period, Spanish football had a tag of eternal underachievers.\n\nI dunno but including supercups doesn‚Äôt feel right. Especially if La liga has won more European cups. \n\nLa liga has definitely won more cups alone and that is just impressive in its self, no need to pad the stats with a trophy that is mostly meaningless\n\n[deleted]\n\n&gt;Premier League fans have still consistently said it's better than La Liga\n\nMost PL fans absolutely weren't saying that between ~2010 - 2019\n\nThey said it was more entertaining, but not of a higher quality. \n\nAnd I would say that it was more entertaining. There wasn't a single team that won back to back trophies between 2010 and 2018, there were multiple different winners (including that utterly mental Leicester season), and shock defeats were happening just about every match day\n\nBecause it is complicated. \n\nLa Liga in europe looks a lot weaker without Real.\n\nThe Prem has the largest group of winning clubs and the largest group of finalists. In the last five years alone it has as many winning clubs as most top leagues have throughout the CL's history. It's usually in the top two coefficient, as well, which is a reflection of the above.\n\nOnly Chelsea, Liverpool, Man utd, Man city and West ham have won European trophies for england which is only 5 teams in the last 25 years.. Where are all the winners you talking about whereas spain has 6\n\nVilla and Forest are CL winners, too. I was talking about CL exclusively, so scrap the likes of West Ham and Sevilla, *or* also start counting Cup Winners Cup as well. Cba doing that, personally.\n\nThese are ancient times my friend we talking last 20 years or max 21st century\n\nFine. In the 21st century the Prem has four clubs to win the CL and six clubs to make the CL final. Name another league\n\nIt's because the prem as a whole is more entertaining not because prem teams win more in Europe. Hence why the Prem earns the most money globally because more people watch it than any other league. Yes Real and Barcelona are two of the 4/5 biggest clubs in the world but doesn't make La liga the best league.\n\ni think the language helps aswell. premier league games are more accessible through out the globe where as other league dint advertise as efficiently.\n\nLa Liga in europe looks a lot different without Real and without Messi-era Barca. Anyway, nobody disputes that Real, Barca and Bayern are top clubs. The contention is that the Prem has the most top clubs of any league, which is true.\n\nEven if we remove Barca and Real which is also redundant still Spain has more trophies then EPL without Barca and Real\n\nRemoving Real alone makes the Prem clubs have the most CL titles by a mile.\n\nUCL is not the only European title.. Without them they would still have more European titles.. They have won UEL 12 times and Super cup 5 times.. Still more then EPL's total\n\nI'm not saying the premier league is better, but it's certainly got a better lower half of the table. Meaning premier league teams can't afford to rest their key players as much as the big teams in laliga\n\nPeople say that but what is this based on? Teams from below 10th don't play in any European competitions so they don't play each other and just because Brentford spend more money on their players that doesn't mean that they are better than Celta Vigo or Mallorca.\n\nAlso, if you look at how Spanish mid-table teams performed in Europe on the rare occasions they did qualify, they perform very well. Celta Vigo EL 1/2, Getafe EL 1/16, Espanyol EL 1/32, Granada EL 1/4.\n\nExactly bro üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ\n\nwell the championship is the best second league in the world by almost all rankings. That's an indication of the depth of english football. Now the top teams may be better in laliga, but the bottom teams are better in the prem. Also, you're talking about mid-table teams, not bottom third teams\n\n&gt;Now the top teams may be better in laliga, but the bottom teams are better in the prem. Also, you're talking about mid-table teams, not bottom third teams.\n\nI'm talking about them because at least there is some comparison that you can make as they played in the same European competitions. Bottom third teams being better is just your opinion which is backed up by nothing.\n\nHahahah. Did you really say that the Championship is the best second league in the world. Forget Championship the bottom half in Premier league can't get out of Europa league group stages\n\nwhich second league is better? I hope you don't think I mean the championship is better than laliga. I mean it's better than the segunda division. Considering no second league sides are in the europa league, I don't really see the relevance\n\nLa Liga Granja üöú üêñ üêÑ  \n\nOne team spend more in a window  than the whole Spanish league or German League combined and not a team in a semi final of the top 2 comps.\n\nThe ultimate farmers league.\n\nSucess isn't everything, it also matters who has the most money\n\nResult is everything on the footballing side of things.. Money is something for the behind of the scenes but what matters is trophies and results on the field. La Liga sides vs EPL sides games say everything there head to head ties is one sided WHICH means La Liga teams got the better of an EPL team like more then 85% of times\n\nWhich could show that Spanish football is better suited to cup formats more than anything else? Take Chelsea‚Äôs UCL wins for example, neither time were they even close to out-and-out best club in Europe, but they still won it. Arguably their 08 final was a better team than both their winning sides. Madrid got dominated by City on several occasions in recent years and on two of those occasions they still pulled through it. \n\nNot everything is about hype and money. If we take out all the fluff, because the very top clubs don‚Äôt even want to be in the UEL, your left with 9 Spanish UCLs made up of just two teams. The best two teams in the world for a long part of the 20 year period, that in itself is not a surprising result. Comparatively England has 6 UCL winners, across 4 different clubs in that same time. Considering the horrendous H2H results against Spanish football still coming out with 6 vs 9 isnt a bad showing at all from the EPL.\n\nThey aren't suited better to cup formats but it comes down to playing style more then anything. EPL is by all means a top league by itself and as you said done good for themselves but not nearly as dominant as spain tho and it comes down to playing style but now since the EPL playing style has changed in the last 3-4 years and more teams are basically La Liga teams Man city and Arsenal are La Liga teams thru and thru because of their playing style and they just happen to play in EPL now..\n\nEPL won 22.5% in that 20 year period of European titles which is less then half of La Liga.  Chelsea won 2 UCL, Liverpool 2 UCL, Man utd 1 UCL and Man city 1 ucl which is 6 UCL and 3 UEL with Chelsea 2 and Man utd 1 while in the Conference West Ham won once. + 4 Super cups that is in total 14 titles out 62\n\nAlso a less competitive league allows for more time to focus on Europe\n\nEurope is a tough plae and England doesn't have the level to dominate it but they can compete and that is just the realistic fact. German, Italian teams and Portuguese, French and other leagues around Europe are competitive.. The English teams have only won 3 Europa league in the last 3 years that is very poor\n\nIt's worth considering that the financial incentives are much much different for PL teams v other European teams though\n\nso you are saying that tough schedule and the physical style of EPL do not a factor why English teams are tired in the UCL?\n\nMate barca madrid winning everything won't get people excited to watch them play vs rest of 17 teams. Prem is more exciting because the teams outside top3 are much closer in quality than in laliga\n\nso the saudi league is th√© best one?\n\nPfff. Lol\n\nThank fuck some one else has pointed this out. People who say the premier league is the best in the world, seem to forget that the most successful teams in Europe have been from La Liga.\n\nI get it tho, premier league has the most money and the top can change very often each season. It's the most entertaining league. However the best. Nah La Liga can back it up\n\nAs a United fan, drawing a Spanish team in the knockout rounds of just about anything gave me so much heartburn. The inevitable shithousery, supported by the worst refereeing performance you've ever seen, added 30 years on to me. I'm 29.\n\nand all that while having way more financial oversight then the top english teams in the last 10 years\n\nDo away with the super cups which is a closed shop and do it again.\n\nIf we remove the Super cup it is 50% for La Liga it won't change much of the total haul but Super cup is indeed a European trophy and without it would have been weird.\n\nIt amplifies the statistics. If a Spanish team wins the CL one year, that trophy is counted and represents a superiority over other nations‚Äô teams that year. You can‚Äôt then also count the subsequent super cup as *further* domination because the rivals were never in a position to compete\n\n&gt;because the rivals were never in a position to compete\n\nBecause they werent good enough? Its not like this is exclusively just for la liga teams\n\nI know this sounds weird, but for me UEFA Super Cup is only worth counting when the UEL winners win it. It basically validates their UEL victory by showing that they can compete with the best of the best. Mourinho‚Äôs Porto after narrowly losing 2003 Super Cup as the UEL winners, actually gained confidence they could compete with the best UCL sides, and that confidence propelled them to winning 2004 UCL.  \n  \nWhen UCL winner wins, it is just the expected result so it feels like they didn‚Äôt really gain anything. But of course, I understand that you should either count all of them or none.\n\nIt's the European Charity Shield. We don't count the English Charity Shield as a proper trophy, so why count the Super Cup?\n\nNah, I agree with them; it's not a major trophy, and shouldn't be counted.\n\nLa Liga still totally dominates, without confusing things by counting meaningless cups\n\nIt is a trophy though and does count.\n\nIf we‚Äôre being honest with ourselves, the only ones the very top 10-15 clubs care about is the UCL. For a long time, particularly before UCL was the reward, the UEFA Cup wasn‚Äôt a desirable tournament. \n\nBut specifically the UCL you have: 6 English winners (4 different teams) vs 9  Spanish winners (2 different teams) + Milan, Inter and 2x Bayern.\n\nThe Europa League is arguably better to use when comparing how good a league is though\n\nIn some ways, I would say it should be discussed from when UCL became the prize for winning because prior to that it was a massive distraction and constantly travelling out towards Russia etc was just not the one.\n\nNot really though. Teams can get knocked in to it from CL. Depending on who goes in van favor the odds for a league.¬†\n\nYeah, the Europa competitions are a level below UCL, the Supercups I take no notice of.\n\nCounting super cups as tophies in this context doesn't make sense to me. It just inflates high numbers and nobody cares/remembers them winning/losing super cups.\n\nIf Atletico ever wins the UCL and a team other than the big three wins the league title again then people might take the La Liga more seriously. Until then people will only care about Real and Barca\n\nOne slight problem with the stat is that the Super Cup somewhat amplifies the effect.\n\nThis makes me think about the claim that Premier League is the hardest and most competitive league in the world.\n\nI thought about it and I think that this claim is still true, but because the difference between  PL top clubs and Mid/low table clubes is smaller than the difference between the TOP La Liga teams and the mid/low table clubs.\n\nThe difference between Arsenal/United/Liverpool and Fullham/Palace/Bournmouth is smaller than the difference between Real/Bar√ßa/Atleti and Levante/Alabes/L√° Coru√±a\n\nThat makes PL a more competitive league. It doesn't make PL top clubes better than L√° Liga ones, but their league is more competitive.\n\nWhat you guys think?\n\nAnyway, it's amazing how La Liga clubs dominates Europe for so long. And I don't see it changing soon.\n\nI feel like Spanish teams are just more ‚Äòclever‚Äô in Europe. No shame when it comes to diving about the place and putting pressure on the ref. (This isn‚Äôt to say other regions don‚Äôt do it just that the Spanish are best at it)\n\nIf English teams played more like this they‚Äôd have more luck in Europe.\n\nThey‚Äôre more clever in their play too. Titi is clear on this since he played in both countries and he says that spain picks players with a brain while other countries prioritize athleticism. The only exception I can think of immediately is scholes.\n\nLa Liga rules in Europe : [https://www.youtube.com/shorts/shom-dkdMlo](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/shom-dkdMlo)\n\nI'm pretty sure the answer lays on the competitiveness of \"la liga\", can't see any other reason for that\n\nI mean, no sane person would say EPL is the better league. Everyone know RM is the biggest club. RM Barca and Bayern in that order have been the biggest clubs of the past 20 years. Maybe Liverpool is 4th.\n\nI agree with the top 3 but liverpool 4th is ridiculous. Liverpool are the 4th best English team of the last 20 years. Manchester united, Chelsea and man city have all been better.\n\nGenuine question, but why would Liverpool be 4th and Bayern 3rd?  \nIn the past 20 years, Bayern and Liverpool have the same numbers of Champions League trophies.\n\nLiverpool have one league title in that time, compared to Bayern‚Äôs 16, Manchester United‚Äôs 6, City‚Äôs 7 and Chelsea‚Äôs 5. Liverpool are lucky to be mentioned. OP should have made the arbitrary period 40 or 50 years if Liverpool were going to be considered great.\n\nBut the post isn't talking about league titles, but about European titles. \n\nAnd Bayern have dominated the Bundesliga in a way that it very difficult/impossible to be achieved in the Premier League or La Liga.\n\nI would say the league outside the best teams is better in epl bc of the unbelievable amount of money. But when it comes to the top teams it‚Äôs no debate. Plus la liga being a better league tactically defenitly helps in knock outs\n\nIt is debatable since the middle of the pack while hugely funded EPL teams have sucked in european competitions. The epl market is hugely inflated.\n\nThis is a major fallacy.. Rayo Vallecano which is a relegation battle team in spain has dominated united at Old trafford before.\n\nIt is actully the oppsite the lower half of english teams are very poor compared to the bigger teams in England that are very good.\n\nHere is the thing most people don't understand about La Liga and premier league.. If you put english teams against Serie A, German or French teams the English teams will come on top majority of the time but not against La Liga teams and I am gonna give you the intellect behind it..\n\nThe english teams are heavily press-oriented at home meaning a random midtable english team can go to france, germany or Italy setup defensively and get away with draw or 1-0 loss and bring that back home  then bump up the pressure a notch this will drawn the German, Italian and French teams 70% of the times..\n\nWhereas the La Liga teams are press-resistent due to high technicality which gives them composure which is key because A random english team will find it hard to get good results out of spain against a random spanish team due to the technicality but once they come home they will fail to beat a random spanish team majority of times because they won't be shocked by the press tempo the english side brings due to composure that steams from their technicality they are self-assured on the ball giving them composure..\n\nExample a Verona, Mainz or Nantes will be tempo shocked playing away to Crystal Palace or Everton but not Valencia, Getefe, Alaves or Celta won't lose composure against the press and gain the initiative and dominate the game despite being the away team.. Because once bottom english team run into press-resistent teams they don't have plan B and mentally fade slowly in the game..\n\nMan utd has example been beaten at home by Real Sociedad, Atleti, Sevilla, Athletic Bilbao and drawn with Celta Vigo, Rayo Vallecano.. These games were end to end because they were able to resist Uniteds press and play themselves out of it whereas 90% of english teams will get eaten by Uniteds pressure and high tempo at old trafford and all they gotta do is sitback and endure but Spanish teams don't have to endure but play themselves out of the press and go on the attack. It is always fun to watch a La Liga side away against an English team it is always end to end outside of Pep's city which is technically not an english side in how they play football.\n\nManchester United also have a terrible press. They press with they‚Äôre fowards very high up the pitch and with not the proper support from their midfield( which is awful defensively) and they‚Äôre defense. Yes la liga teams are more technical and tactically adept, but the average EPL team has an unbelievable amount of physicality. Theyres a reason players like Bryan Gil or Roberto Soldado were extremely productive in la liga and highly technical but juts not strong enough for EPL. But I would agree La Liga is the best league overall but using Manchester United as a bar is not a great example they are not good and get carved up by everyone\n\nBut then why German and Italian team are beating Spannish teams, and English teams are beating German or Italian teams or why Spanish teams are beating English?\n\nLiverpool slipping themself with RM is the funniest. They literally have 1 PL in last 30 years and 1 CL in last 10 years.\n\nSo little victories and so much noise.\n\nPretty rich coming from a United fan. What‚Äôve they won in the last 10 years?\n\nUnited is still out of reach for Liverpool. 1PL vs 13. No competition whatsoever.\n\nLiverpool have won more trophies than United you moron. Look it up.\n\nYou dumbass, all those trophies are from more than 40-50 years. In modern era, you guys are nothing in front of United.\n\nEven in your best premier league era all you could win was 1 PL in 10 years. Even Leciester won 1 league titles. People laugh at Spurs for bottling their chances, but the real bottlers have been liverpool FC.\n\nWhat so do they not count? Should we not count two of United‚Äôs CLs because they were in the 20th century? \n\nLiverpool‚Äôs dominant era was in the 70s and 80s; United‚Äôs was in the 90s and 2000s. Football is cyclical.\n\nBest PL era up against one of the greatest teams the world has ever seen. Nothing ‚Äúbottling‚Äù about coming second to this City side with 97 and 93 points. \n\nStill more than what United have won in the last ten years. At least you can watch Liverpool play in the Champions League next season because United aren‚Äôt gonna be there üëç\n\nNo United fan is saying the team is good. Most us agree we have been shit for a decade.\n\nBut for the love of god, learn some humility. Every one loves a good underdog story and Liverpool are English football‚Äôs biggest underdogs, stop acting like you are some champions.\n\nYour accomplishments are same as chelsea in last decade.No wait, Chelsea has more trophies than you guys and yet you see no cocky Chelsea fans.More PL‚Äôs and more European trophies than liverpool. Leicester has the same number of PL titles.\n\nBe humble because your legendary coach is leaving this year. This might be the last year Liverpool fans will have pride in their team.\n\nFootball didn‚Äôt begin in 1992 Liverpool have 19 league titles.\n\nWhat the fuck are you waffling on about ‚Äúbiggest underdogs‚Äù? Most successful club in English football. You‚Äôre either completely deluded or have clearly suffered a brain injury so I‚Äôm gonna leave you with this [chart](https://i.redd.it/jycn6gamxrkc1.jpeg?app_web_view=ios) of trophies won.\n\nHope you see a doctor to check that brain injury out soon. All the best.\n\nOnly liverpool fans talk about some bygone era. In past 30 years, you have been shit. Learn some humility.\n\nA league is made up of more than just 2 teams. This is exactly what people mean when they say la liga is weak. All you liga fans can talk about is madrid and barca but what about the rest of the league? No sane person would type out your comment and be serious...\n\nI mean if we're strictly talking about 2000-2020 then the of rest of La Liga still trumped EPL because they dominated UEFA/Europa Cup. It's not just Sevilla too since Atletico, Villarreal, and even Valencia have won it. True, they weren't as dominant as Madrid and Barca but generally speaking they always beat middle of the packs of EPL like Arsenal, United, Tottenham, or Liverpool.\n\nThe one \"advantage\" that EPL had over La Liga was that their top teams tend to have shorter cycles at the top but even that is no longer true as Man City has simply replaced Man U and Chelsea's short reign as the de facto powerhouse of EPL.\n\nYou can't have rational conversations with EPL fans. Their league is inflated by mediocre players getting paid insane amounts of money. La liga with much smaller budgets has dominated every EU competition in the past 20 years. Anyone who has watched football can agree.\n\nRM during their prime were unmatched. Barca during their prime were unmatched. Both the best teams to have played the sport.\n\n&gt;RM during their prime were unmatched. Barca during their prime were unmatched. Both the best teams to have played the sport..\n\nit is easier for teams like Barcelona, Real Madrid or Bayern to be consistent in UCL because they playing in the UCL every year and there is no danger to loose your spot. Unlike in England where teams like Manchester United, Liverpool, Tottenham, Chelsea and Arsenal could loose their spot. Also it is easier to retain your players when you are Real, Barca or Bayern because you are playing in the UCL every year. It is harder to sell the idea to glory hunting players that you are maybe going to play in the UCL or you are maybe going to win a trophy with United for example. They do not care that tittle with United is going to be more viable that winning another tittle in Germany with Bayern.\n\nThe real question is who wins more if each league faced off based on position, 1st v 1st, 2nd v 2nd.\n\nLa Liga would take it in my opinion.\n\n? 5 out of the last 6 finals have had English teams involved. 7  out of the last 12 finalists. Man city have been the best team in the world for the last 4 years, not Real Madrid. \n\nWe are not talking historically over the last 20 years, in the most recent seasons EPL is obviously the best league.\n\nDidn't RM slap around all epl teams to win it in 2022? \n\nAren't all epl teams out of CL already this year?\n\nAll EPL teams out this year doesn't change the fact that they have been the most dominant over the last 6 seasons in be UCL.\n\nReal Madrid winning it in 2022 doesn't change the fact that Man city have been the best team in the world over the last 4 years. Man city were the better team in that tie, as were Liverpool in the final.\n\nLa liga is a great league but to pretend that it's the best league atm doesn't make any sense. And that's okay, it doesn't need to always be the best league. Just like the premier league won't always be the best league.\n\nYou're talking like the 60's, 70's and 80's don't matter. Calling them 'ancient' is also a bit disrespectful. Players like Pele, Cruijff and Maradona (I know Pele never played in Europa Cup I and Maradona never won it) played in those eras and had a huge impact on the game. Those ancient times made football the game it is today.\n\nSome folks on an Isle where screaming their lungs out claiming they had the best league in the world üò≠üò≠ü§£\n\nwhat\n\nMessi and CR7 did a good job winning in the last 20 years. True legends.\n\nRemove Barca and real in that period la liga would stil have most trophies\n\nWhy did you count SuperCups? That's just stupid\n\nOnly, Porto, Liverpool, Barcelona, Milan, Man U, inter Milan, Chelsea, Bayern Munich, Real Madrid, &amp; Man City have won the UCL in that period. Thats 10 team in 20 years \n\n4 English \n2 Italian \n2 Spanish\n1 German\n1 Portuguese \n\nBy that metric English teams are the best in Europes UCL this goes to show that you can back up any narrative you want with specific data sets...\n\nAll this shows is that La Liga teams are better at tournament football, and has no reflection on how strong the league are?\n\nWho cares about the different number of teams.. This reminds me about the competitive angle analogy that was being pushed back in 2015-2019 before city lmao..\n\nOnly 5 teams won something in Europe for England and before last year it was only 3..\n\nSome other EPL fans actully said Barca and Real don't count for La Liga because they are world teams lmao..\n\nThe importance is how much can you collect not how many different teams collected.. City winning their first ever or Man utd once is completely irrelevant..\n\nReal-Barca are La Liga teams and collected 11 trophies since 21st... that is what matters\n\nCorrect but it's all about timeframes isn't it, in the 70s English teams won 6 consecutive European cups in a row. &amp; over 90's year Real Madrid have won 14 titles, \n\nCurrently, La Liga teams are very good at winning tournament Football, and that's only 2 teams realistically. Some people in this thread are claiming the la Liga is the best league because of it. Which it's not, oranges and apples.\n\nNot only two teams and if you even remove these two teams they would have still most trophies.. Teams like Sevilla, Valencia and Atletico Madrid have really cooked in Europe\n\nI was talking about Sevilla who have won the Europa league 7 times in the past 20 years &amp; Real Madrid who have won the Champions League Only 5 times in the past 20 years. \n\nSevilla are carrying la Liga hard, They don't get the credit they deserve, best knockout tournament club in Europe?\n\nUCL is a farmers league\n\nLaliga wins more and probably has the better teams but the prem has more money , more power so it‚Äôs better\n\nTheir two biggest teams are cheats. Illegal subsidies, paying off refs etc,\n\nIn the 21st century, 4 Spanish (Sevilla, Atletico, Villarreal, Valencia) &amp; 3 English teams (Chelsea, Man United, Liverpool) have won the EL and 2 Spanish (Real, Barca) &amp; 4 English teams (Chelsea, Liverpool, Man United, Man City) have won the CL\n\nAlso in the 21st century, a total of 6 different English teams (Chelsea, Liverpool, Man United, Man City, Arsenal, Tottenham) have made the CL Final vs only 3 Spanish teams (Real, Barca &amp; Atletico)\n\nThe reason the PL is the better league is because there‚Äôs more big clubs in England (6 clubs capable of making a 21st century CL final vs only 3 for Spain) which is due to the much higher viewership and match attendances which bring in much more revenue for the clubs \n\nReal Madrid as a team are definitely the Kings of Europe (no one will ever deny this) but as a league only Real &amp; Barca have ever won the CL with only Barca, Real &amp; Atletico being part of the European Elite from Spain (with Atletico also up there having appeared in CL Finals before despite not winning)\n\nThe big La Liga teams even know this, which is why the Super League included the 3 big Spanish teams and the 6 big English teams when it was planned (Thank God it failed)\n\nGoing back into the 70‚Äôs &amp; 80‚Äôs you also have Aston Villa &amp; Nottingham Forest who have won the CL too as well as Leeds United who have made a CL final but lost to Bayern  \n\nThat‚Äôs a total of 6 English teams who have won the CL (Liverpool, Man United, Chelsea, Man City, Aston Villa &amp; Nottingham Forest) &amp; 3 other English finalists (Tottenham, Arsenal &amp; Leeds) vs a total of 2 Spanish teams who have won the CL (Real &amp; Barca) vs only 1 other Spanish finalist (Atletico)\n\nFinally someone said it\n\nNo.. 4 la liga teams won the UEl not 3.. YOU forgot Valencia so technically 4 teams won UEL for la liga.. Spin in it however you like it.. 6 spanish teams won in Europe in that period whereas only 5 english teams..\n\nBefore last year it would have been only 3 teams EPL who won anything in Europe in that period which is Liverpool, chelsea and man utd\n\nI edited it, thanks for pointing that out\n\nBut the the EL pales in comparison to the CL as Europe‚Äôs elite and best clubs play in the CL and not the EL, so the point still stands as England has twice as many clubs able to compete for the CL when compared to Spain \n\nThis is why both Real &amp; Barca wanted 6 English clubs in the Super League but only 3 Spanish clubs and 3 Italian clubs (the elite clubs in the Spanish &amp; Italian leagues know England has more elite clubs and more clubs able to compete at the highest echelons of the European competition)\n\nIt was for commercial purpose that is why they wanted the big six not based on results..\n\nThey invited the big 3 from Portugal based on same rules\n\nThe original 12 were 6 English clubs, 3 Spanish clubs and 3 Italian clubs - this is because all the teams involved are aware England has the most big clubs in Europe \n\nAll the clubs have made CL finals in the 21st century with twice as many English clubs winning the CL as Spanish clubs in the 21st century (with this gap widening even further when including the 20th century)\n\nLook at the [UEFA official coefficient](https://www.uefa.com/nationalassociations/uefarankings/) - the Premier League is ranked ahead of La Liga. It‚Äôs a verified fact that the Premier League has had more clubs which have won the CL and more clubs which have been CL Finalists, with England having a greater depth of big teams than Spain\n\nDude it was based on commercial ans yes commercial yes England has 6 big teams backed by the social media numbers as well but not based on football terms..\n\nBesides Italian should have been five or six.. Italian has 5 big teams.. Juve, two Milans, Roma and napoli\n\nHow many CL finals have Roma or Napoli made in their entire history, let alone in the 21st century? üòÇ\n\nIf you want to ignore the facts that more Prem teams have won the CL and made CL finals and ignore the official UEFA Rankings then go ahead \n\nI‚Äôm done with debating when you‚Äôre ignoring the facts, I‚Äôm trying to watch the Chelsea game\n\nRoma and napoli are commercially big teams. The invitation was based on commercial nothing else which is entirely irrelevant to this topic\n\n commercially?\n\nNow try and explain the OFFICIAL UEFA ranking or why more Premier League teams have won the CL and made CL finals than La Liga teams\n\nLol.. English teams have only won 6 times since the 21st entury whereas Spain 11 times. If you expand it.. it is irrelevant how many different clubs collected it whereas in 2023 only 3 teams from EPL had won any European trophy whether it is UCL or EL for 25 effing years.. Get outta here.\n\nBut you are only focussing on UCL which is irrelevant but all 3 competitions count and in that it is 6 vs 5 for Spain in different teams that won Europe but again not that important aspect\n\nNow give me that stats with La Liga teams in semi finals compared to everyone else.\n\nif you did EPL v La Liga 1 v 1, 2 v 2 etc, I think EPL would win but Madrid are clearly the top dogs in football. From what I've seen in Spain virtually everyone supports Madrid/Barca and every other team is a 2nd team. Therefore their biggest team is gonna have that dominance."

It's about time other clubs unite and do the same.\n\nSo, you're saying other clubs...should be...United?\n\n*flies away*\n\nmake them play every day now\n\nTo be honest, I, as a spectator, would definitely not mind watching football every day.\n\nthere‚Äôs never a day without football. be true to your word and watch the colombian 4th division on a monday.\n\nGot me there, not gonna lie.\n\nYes officer this post, he literally flew away. No I‚Äôm not  lying!\n\nsancho punching air right now that hes is not in united when the new fifa is about to release\n\nFeck off! ü§£ü§£ü§£\n\nüíÄü§£\n\nüëä\n\nMate‚Ä¶ they literally played earlier lol! What do you mean strike? I‚Äôve been watching them for years\n\nCity will come out of their 115 charges case first before doing anything else.¬†\n\nContracts with game limits feels closer than ever, and if not that, with a significant bonus premium after a certain number of games\n\nThink they'll take a pay cut to play less games?\n\nAlso, imagine a player getting left out of games for the run in or in the build up to a final because they‚Äôd already played 59 out of their 60 allowed games this season. No player is accepting that.\n\n‚Ä¶and i imagine the contracts would be written with that situation in mind\n\nNo, that game would be fine, they definitely wouldn't be too tired for that one.....\n\nBig players would kick off if they got played in the League cup at knowing that might mean they miss later stages of champions league.\n\nHe could already go play for United and play less games without less money\n\nif money were a thing they would all be in saudi rn or try to be, when u get too rich money is just a number , reece James gets paid so much but he is depressed that he keeps getting injured again and again\n\nWith the chance of getting additional contracts because their body isn‚Äôt breaking down‚Ä¶? Possibly\n\nIt‚Äôs not a money issue. This strike wouldn‚Äôt be about bonuses. It‚Äôs a quality issue. Quality of life and quality of entertainment. Knackered players delivers lower quality entertainment.\n\nThe expanded schedule also raises the risk of injury exponentially. It's much more than 2x games translates into 2x injury. Bodies need downtime.\n\nFor every Rodri there's a hundred less known workhorse players on smaller teams whose careers end early due to injury. No bonuses are going to be better than more years added onto your career due to not being injured.\n\nDeBruyne and Rodri may be extremely wealthy and  seem like they're being entitled crybabies, but the extra money they lose by playing fewer games is a fuckton more than the average player, and most teams don't have as deep of a bench as City, so players for smaller clubs are already expected to play through injuries and don't have the luxury of taking months s off for a sprain or pulled muscle.\n\nI think people massively underestimate how the players we watch in top leagues are already well above average in terms of not being injury prone.\n\nPrecisely - but the contracts are a way to handle that from the player‚Äôs point of view. These players have a limited career, and will want to be paid accordingly. If x manager wants to burn through that career in record time, then they could be protected from that, or at least compensated additionally to take in to account the shorter career\n\nDo you honestly believe that?\nNo player wants to create an opportunity for another player to come in and potentially do better than them.\n\nIf they want to stop more games being added, it has to be as a collective.\n\nThere is no reason to reduce overall number of game for everyone. Clubs that plays a lot of competitions like Real or Man U have the squad to handle it. \nThe problem only concerns top player like Rodri that plays everything. Club, coach and players have shown they cannot be trusted to handle top players with restrain. A 50 game limit per season could be the way.\n\nAnd then the same old discussion will arise: less games equal less TV and stands revenue. Less revenue often equal smaller salaries. \n\nReducing the workload while maintaining current salaries will be the real battle to be fought for them.\n\nReduce workload for top player, then reduces their wages as well. I mean, oh no Rodri now only get paid 9M instead of 11M, how will he cope ???\n\nPer player, not team.\n\nCant imagine a manager not getting around this by playing them a lot early. Chances are they'll want to play in the most important fixtures\n\nAnd that would be why the contracts could be structured with that in mind. Want to take a year off the players career due to not resting them? Fine - but you‚Äôll pay through the nose over games after 50\n\nThe amount of games is ridiculous... but they equally need to be in the shoes of the average fan having to pay for the increase in Season Tickets / Merchandise each year - Football is stupid as a whole.\n\nEntire bubble just needs bursting.\n\nDefinitely. I have even noticed i prefer watching the football league over Premier league now just because of the actual corruption at the top is alarming.\n\nThe way ticket prices have come up.. shirts are ridiculous! 70-100 quid for a shirt are they having a fucking laugh? \n\nI used to love the Premier league. Not anymore. Joke league. I hope it dies\n\nThis! \n\nThey‚Äôre making generational wealth for kicking a ball around. \n\nThis is pure nonsense.. All that money that is spend on transfers and salaries, no matter how much anyone likes football, it‚Äôs coming out of the general public‚Äôs pockets either via tickets, shirts or sponsorship‚Äôs which consumers are eventually paying for. \n\nImplement a 400k salary cap and then start a discussion on employment conditions! \n\n‚ÄúProfessional‚Äù sports are starting to become a menace for the common folk..\n\n\nPS. I love sports but not these salaries and all that comes with makes it less and less fun :(\n\nThey make that money because so many people want to see them kicking a ball around.\n\nObviously there is big money being made and, shouldn‚Äôt the largest share of said big money go to the players who are the reason said big money is being made? They are the product. I think they deserve a far larger portion than the owners. Nobody is paying to watch Florentino P√©rez Rodr√≠guez play or buying jerseys with the Abu Dhabi group or Glazer on the back. I‚Äôd rather see the money go to them than the billionaire owners.\n\nTrue to some degree, but it might just as well be a bubble that will (soon) collapse.\n\nBeen saying that since the 90s lol\n\nIt's literally more popular than it has ever been, with global growth annually, finally penetrating even the US market to become a more household sport over there.\n\nIt isn't even close to bursting. It's only just beginning its ascension.\n\nYeah but have u seen the price for a man utd/liverpool home top. We are ridiculous to even pay these elites\n\nWell, I don't pay them. I support my local, and even then, I'm not paying ¬£50 for a football shirt so have only had one in the last 6 years.\n\nLook at the kit prices in the US. NHL teams for example charge over $200 for jerseys over there, and it is completely normalised. Football will absolutely try and do the same thing, and more than likely win.\n\nRemember, companies/organisations only continue to raise their prices because morons with zero self respect for their finances continue to bankroll it and make purchases no matter how extortionate. If people just stopped and said \"nope that's too much\", then prices would inevitably drop substantially. \n\nAs with everything in modern society, blame idiots for enabling it.\n\nCollapse from 50k a week to 40k a week?\n\nThey‚Äôre making generational wealth for being in the top 1% at what they do. They spent their whole lives working on being really good at what they do. If it was as easy as you make it out to be, why aren‚Äôt you making generational wealth for kicking a ball? \nAlso, no one is forcing fans to pay for tickets or jerseys. They do it willingly. They also do it because they want to see these people who are very good at what they do, do what they‚Äôre good at.\n\n&gt; They‚Äôre making generational wealth for being in the top 1% at what they do\n\nNot even. It is because so many people want to see them doing it\n\nExactly! The whole \"they make so much for kicking a ball around\" is just small minded, and likely, jealous talk. \n\nThey're ultra competitive and want to be at the top of their game for as long as possible, it's literally common sense. Go look up how many professional sportsmen get depressed when they're injured and can't compete. \n\nAnd if you think footballers earn too much, you don't understand a thing about supply and demand.\n\nThat's not the point people are making. Footballers also are little pawns in this game.\n\nYeah but they milking us like a cow. Cows give milk. Does that mean we can take all of its milk ?\n\nThey make more money from advertising than anything else. So we either stop watching so advertisers don‚Äôt have a platform or we just accept it is what it is\n\nadding a salary cap would not work... it's not the fact they kick a ball around, it's the sheer amount of influnence they hold and brands will pay millions upon millions to sponsor these players, you can literally go to a 3rd world country where they struggle to eat and you will see someone wearing a football shirt. as long as football is popular the players will always be especially the best ones.\n\nAnd again, the problem is that you and me are paying these players because the advertisement is indirectly charged to us, the companies just have their name on it instead of Dexman..\n\nHave you ever been to a third world country and spoke to those people..?\n\nThose are two completely different problems that need completely different solutions\n\nIf the football bodies doesn't do anything about it, players will have to get used to it once they start playing all those fixtures.¬†\n\nChelsea packing their squad up might not be a bad thing after all.\n\nIt‚Äôs genuinely the only option. They‚Äôve introduced load management already for Cole Palmer, and it‚Äôs a matter of time before it‚Äôs the same for other star players at other clubs. Chelsea can afford to bench Cole Palmer because they‚Äôve got Christopher Nkunku and Joao Felix to back him up. It‚Äôll be soon when it‚Äôs normal to have two/three backups for each spot.\n\nYeah, the talent chelsea has is damn good. If maresca can figure out the perfect combination and players lock in, then this team is genuinely good enough to challenge for the title.\n\nisn't there a max limit to the number of players you can keep on a team? every major sport usually has some sort of maximum amount of players you can use so you can't just have 50 guys who are all eligible to play\n\nthere is a limit on how much you can register for each competition\n\nYeah which unless you're gonna have a fair few players miss out on one or two comps, it's irrelevant\n\nOnce again we fail to comprehend Todd Boehly‚Äôs genius master plan. \n\nGallagher, Chukwuemeka, Fofana and Kepa aren‚Äôt surplus to requirements. They‚Äôre the reserve army of labour. \n\nWhile every other team in the league is scrambling to field a full team, he‚Äôs got an entire XI of potential scabs ready to play.\n\nI understand why the team was being packed with players. Our past couple of seasons have been really tarnished by injuries.\n\nFour games into the season and they're already tired. Is this a new record?\n\nOff seasons are getting shorter and shorter with clubs jetting off around the world, just look at spurs flying to Australia after last season ended to play a friendly against Newcastle (?). Then those players go off to an international tournament and then back for the start of the season. It's not sustainable. \n\nThey earn a lot of money because they generate a lot of money, but most professional athletes end up retiring with issues people don't even think about sometimes (knee replacements for example in ex footballers can come at a surprisingly young age). \n\nLike was mentioned elsewhere in the thread, it wouldn't shock me if major star players managed to get clauses in figure contracts regarding the number of games they play in a given season.\n\nYou are forgetting abouth the Copa Am√©rica, Euros and last week's FIFA Break\n\nPlus the new club world cup.\n\nAnd the new champions league format with more matches\n\nIt‚Äôs still last season for the good players.\n\nthey've played more if you count pre season\n\nFor some of them, there was hardly an off season.\n\n2 games for 1 mil euro a week... Don't tell these guys what regular work looks like.\n\ndick head\n\nIsn't it then up to the clubs to recognise when players are worn out, and rotate them out the team for another squad player? For the amount of money they get, it seems pretty funny to moan about this,\n\nExactly, the governing bodies have increased the squad sizes, bench sizes etc. But it's always the same players week in week out. Funny how lower league players aren't coming out and complaining when they can end up playing just as many games if successful enough.\n\nNot everyone can afford 2 squads like Man City.\n\n\"Funny how lower league players aren't coming out and complaining when they can end up playing just as many games if successful enough.\"\n\nWeird take.\n\nShow me which lower league teams have players playing across all of Europe in the Champions League, then abroad if successful to play in the Club World Cup, then in the Euros or World Cup or Copa America or African Cup Of Nations and then immediately back into a league where they have international breaks to play for their country again during Nations League or friendlies.\n\nI'll be waiting.\n\nBecause if city rotated their squad they'd be shit too, how do you not understand that. \n\nLower leagues don't have international breaks.\n\nAre you stupid?\n\nYou just said this which is what I was responding to \"Funny how lower league players aren't coming out and complaining when they can end up playing just as many games if successful enough.\"\n\nCity have a better B team than 90% of other teams A team.\n\nI don't think you have a clue what you're on about.\n\n\"Because if city rotated their squad they'd be shit too, how do you not understand that.\"\n\nCity's bench vs Brentford:  \nRuben Dias  \nRodri  \nBernado Silva  \nGvaridol  \nDoku  \nFoden  \nOrtega\n\nArsenals bench vs Spurs:  \nJesus  \nSterling  \nNwaneri  \nKivior  \nKabia  \nKacurri  \nLewis-Skelly  \nHeaven\n\nCitys bench was a literal starting squad, while they still had De Bruyne, Grealish, Kovacic and Gundogan playing but if they rotate they'd be shit lmfao.\n\nLower leagues don't have the top tier facilities the best players have ffs\n\nExactly, blame their coaches for not managing the squad workload. They have to take risks playing with the reserves sometimes. Maybe they cannot play with high tempo all the matches too. \n\nThis is something everyone who played FM knows üòÇ\n\nAny member of the public that has sympathy for 'tired' professional footballers has their priorities completely wrong.\n\nbros receiving +3M a year and going on strike because \"buh buh workload\"\n\nbro u dont even work 40H per weeks\n\nfuck off\n\nask ur manager to rotate, u have +24 players on team a, plus +24 on team b and +100 in another academys\n\ntrue\n\nand if anything his manager is at fault. People can keep parroting this 'more games' bullshit but it really isn't. \n\nIt's like managers who just demand constant pressing from his players. If there will be few less games and players will be fresher then Pep will tell them to press even more to gain an advantage, or if he doesn't do it someone else will. And we will end up with less games but players running and pressing even more on average per game.\n\nThis is a very ignorant take. The more they play, the greater the injury risk. One tough injury can derail a career. Thats what they want to avoid, allowing their careers to be made shorter.\n\nThat said, I do agree that being such a profitable career, it makes sense for these serious sacrifices to be made. I think theres a thin line.\n\nOverworking at the risk of health applies to every industry. It is the employer‚Äôs call whether they need more resource or whether they can balance the workload.\n\nClubs already can register slightly more than 2 teams of players. Lack of rotation is entirely City‚Äôs decision.\n\nThis! Players should have a talk with their bosses if they feel they play too much. If anything, the clubs should go on strike and not register for competitions if they feel the calendar is too full.\n\nExactly. Just ask the manager to rotate. Every team has a ton of good but frustrated players on the bench\n\nYou can literally retire in your 30s\n\nWrong perspective.\n\nThe football will be less entertaining to watch if the players are burnt.\n\nnot an argument. a short career doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs OK to massively overwork players. they‚Äôre still human.\n\nbigger workloads don‚Äôt just affect players but the fans too; we all want to see the best players play, not on the treatment table.\n\nOn top of that, we get a worse product as viewers.\n\nDoesn't matter which sport it is, fans want to see their favourite/the clubs best players play. Fans want to see exciting games, played by fit players.\n\nIf you start getting players to play 70+ games a year with internationals, europe and 2 national cups to participate in, they either get rotated often so you miss out on them, or they play tired. Or get injured.\n\nThere not massively over worked ffs. They are worked to an extent where they might not he at peak performance levels. There is big difference and the latter is perfectly fine. If a club or player isn't happy with that, then rest him for a couple of games or give him a week off training.\n\nFucking hell people need to get a grip on reality man. \"Still human\" as if they are being treated inhumanely by playing football 3 times a week. This isn't slave labour, this is just them having to operate at 90% because they are fatigued.\n\nThe simps are out of control.\n\n\nYou read em like every single footballer is exploited in a mine working 23 hours until they die.\n\n\n\n\nAnd not an issue of 0.000001% of the total football players.\n\n\nAlso if rodri is tired, rodri can go to Mallorca or another mid table team, earn still a huge salary and not having to play so many games. \"But they wanna win everything\", not really since they bitch they have to play\n\nFor teams in the Club World Cup the off-season this year will be 3 weeks. That is absolutely fucking insanity, look at the off-season of any other major sport, nothing comes close to that.\n\nWish the players would speak out the same way against the extortionate prices fans pay to watch them play. Millions of people would happily take the workload if they were being paid millions to do it.\n\nOr how underpaid the workers that support then are.\n\nAgree with this point too üëçüèº\n\nI‚Äôm sorry but they play maybe 3 games a week, likely no more than 2, have days off and training days aren‚Äôt exactly 9-5. On top of that they have summer off unless they choose otherwise. They are such entitled pricks it‚Äôs unreal.\n\nTotally unpopular opinion I guess. But more games means more players per squad (teams having to rely on more than the usual squad of 25 players) which means more players would have the opportunity to go pro in Europe. Of course, teams would opt for cheaper markets for their recruitments, say Africa and South America.\n\nCould improve the football levels in these countries and the lively hood of the footballer's local communities.\n\nIt's only an opinion, honestly I haven't done any research behind it. \n\nPlease don't hesitate to correct me if I am missing something or being wrong on the whole thing\n\nThe problem is most elite managers don‚Äôt want to fill out those extra positions in their squad if those extra players aren‚Äôt (potentially) on the same level of the squad or higher. Because signing players of lower quality affects the quality of the squad, training levels etc. This is what Arne Slot said this summer: he wanted new players but only players that could add to the team that was already there.\nSigning less quality players as a back-up to the elite first team player also sends a message to the elite player that his position on the team is safe, so it also lowers internal competition.\n\nRodri needs to talk to his manager about squad rotation.\n\nThere's a reason why clubs have 25 man squads, and if Pep's not good enough to use it wisely, that's his problem.\n\nTruth is he probably doesn‚Äôt have an argument, so he can‚Äôt go to Pep and can only whine to the press like a spoiled rich brat.\n\nIs Jack Grealish one of them?\n\nHow about Stefan Ortega?\n\nKovacic?\n\n.... ask your manager to rotate.\n\nI recommend they try working any other physical job in the world. \n\nOne that doesn‚Äôt have access to the best medical care, physios, massage, work like 20 hour weeks, make millions, retire at 35.\n\nWith how much player's salaries have gone up every year without more games (up until recently), cry me a river. Take a pay cut for less games then\n\nI‚Äôm all for people striking for better pay/conditions/rights etc - but this is a joke.\n\nit's not about pay, it's the amount of game increase and you can't expect players to play 2 games a week every week for 11 months, the body can only take so much\n\nThey have a squad for a reason. If Pep decides to play him every game even when he feels he is overworked, then that‚Äôs their own making.\n\nThey can go to other leagues that have less competition or games like in the premier league. That's the league all about money and pr, and they want to keep that it, but it comes with more money and tempo.\n\nOn strike for what? Its in the fucking contract and you signed it, if you dont play theb take the pay cut, players just want the cake all to themselves\n\nImagine getting paid millions and millions of pounds a year to play football and moan about it. They should be grafting for those spots. Try 60 hour a week of Labour for 25k a year.\n\nImagine being millonaire and crying for that\n\nOh no. The best players on the best teams in the country not playing every game in the cups? How will we survive when the thing we‚Äôve been asking for for years happens? The horror\n\nIts disgraceful that footballers are being asked to play football, in return for millions of pounds every year.\n\nOk, but then lets reduce the salaries while we‚Äôre at it\n\nHow much more than people in Africa do u earn and for how many hours\n\nEveryday people work their assess off and don't get paid millions on millions\n\nLike 90% of the population works harder and has way less to show for it.\n\nThere's no union though right? How would this work in actual practice without a collective bargaining agreement and between leagues?\n\nExactly.  When the Boeing workers went on strike, they stopped working for Boeing.  \n\nIf these players go on strike, just who are they striking against?  Their clubs?  Leagues?  UEFA?\n\nThere is in the uk. [The PFA](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Footballers‚Äô_Association)\n\nThat's interesting to find out. Thanks! I wonder what kind of power they have compared to the various sports unions in the US, where they strike and threaten to strike often and seem to get their way fairly regularly\n\nFIFPRO is the worldwide representative organisation for pro footballers. Basically a union.\n\nTheir wikipedia page lists all the countries' Players Associations.\nTheir are 66 members. Most major nations are there. Germany and Brazil are the only notable missing members. Germany has their own one. And Brazil I can't find much info about but they seem to have one. \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFPRO\n\nHave they ever threatened a strike or made public demands or any kind? I‚Äôve never seen anything like what goes on in the US\n\nWaaaah 115.\n\nMany footballers are facing this problem, and the expansion of champions league are making more problems. Recently, many players have been injured. Remember pedri in 2021? He played 73 games, playing games when it's not needed. He was playing much more games than his older peers. He was playing twice as many games compared to those talent youngsters in his age group\n\nI dunno about this, being touted for the ballon d‚Äôor n speaking like this‚Ä¶.smh.\n\nIt‚Äôs that time of year again where Rodri‚Äôs eyebrows disappear üíâ\n\nI dunno about this, being touted for the ballon d‚Äôor n speaking like this‚Ä¶.smh.\n\nI hope the players do strike. How many of you football fans will stand with the players?\n\nI think things will change when more players suffer from cardiac arrest. \nYes they are getting paid millions but at the end of the day they aren‚Äôt robots.\n\nI really could not give a hoot about what any city player has to say tbh. Especially Kovachic\n\nI don't get it. Big teams have a lot of players, including many who are frustrated not to play more \n\nThey just need to rotate more\n\nClubs and players need to accept that it is a squad game now. The club doesn't have to be field the same 11 every game. Rodri doesn't have start 50 games per season.\n\nThere are plenty of other players who are able to step in for Rodri. Sure it would be a weaker line up for Man City that game, but that is the price they pay for running so deep in all competitions.\n\nIf the players are concerned about their health and well being they should take it up with their club and nobody else. No club has the right to win every competition and managing your squad is a part of that.\n\nSurely that‚Äôs why teams have large squads. Maybe don‚Äôt play the same team week in and week out.\n\nTeams have a squad for a reason, managers should be managing player game time so that they aren't overworked but because there's so much pressure from fans, media and owners to win every game then where possible they will play their best players and then they do get overworked.\n\nImagine living the dreams of millions, having the best job itw and still complaining\n\nAny increase in games over the last 30-35 years (in European leagues) has come almost exclusively from the constant expansion of the UCL and it's minor competitions. \n\n\nOther competitions have reduced the number of games.\n\n\nSo cast you ire at the European games - stay away from any further reduction in domestic competitions. \n\n\nOr, you know, take your millions and stop complaining...\n\nI mean managers know how to prioritise to compete in the games they need to. It will just mean more rotating, and more likely less important cups get the Carling cup treatment.\n\nLess training, more balling.\n\nGood. With the players so knackered the quality of the football goes down. I'd rather have fewer games and the players we'll rested for a decent Euro's, Copa or World Cup then the snooze fest we got this summer.\n\nPoor fucking millionaires\n\nThe top footballers are forced to play far too much but they are paid ridiculous amounts of money to kick a ball - it‚Äôs pure greed by the clubs and administrators of the game.\n\nBut if you asked the players would you be okay with being paid significantly less for playing less I imagine most players would take the big money\n\nThis will be interesting.\n\nI wonder how a Football workload compares to NHL schedule. NHL players can have 3 games in 4 days including hours of travel between games. These players also can skate an average 7-8 km per game. Each season also has a min of 82 games for each team and max of 110 for the Stanley cup finalists.\n\nDifferent workload per match. A NHL match lasts 60 min, a football match takes 90min plus added time. The average distance in a football match in top leagues is in between 10-12km - that's running, not skating, bear in mind. Most of top league clubs play, on average, between 55-60 matches per season, with some leagues reaching closer to 70-80 matches a season (the Brazilian league, for instance). Usually the minimum rest time between matches is 3 days or 72 hours, but during some periods it can take almost a week between eatch game.\nAlso, travel time varies wildly, depending very much in which league the club plays in. If you're a Premier League club, you will probably circulate on a bus or train all over, occasionally taking a plane for UEFA matches elsewhere in Europe. If you're a Brazilian club, you'll be flying all over the country and travel times are simply longer on average.\n\nUefa need stop making up dumb tournaments .\n\nIs there not a players Union?\n\nThey should go on strike about the shit quality of the refereeing, the 115 charges being conducted behind closed doors, and the conflict of interests from the refs who are in the pockets of the Saudi's.\n\nMaybe your manager could just rotate\n\nCyclists in the Tour De France do a 1.5 seasons worth of work in the space of 3 weeks, some of them come off their bikes at 30mph and get back on to climb a fucking mountain. \n\nFootball players are pampered moist fucking fannies\n\nI would be a lot more sympathetic if they all weren‚Äôt millionaires and retire in their 30‚Äôs..\n\nHe can go on strike soon in league 2\n\nHave a word with your manager then. He's the one who's playing you every minute of every game\n\nWhy is no pressure being put on clubs to enforce proper rotation? There are ment to be squads of 24 players. Most clubs only use 14 players on a regular basis. \n\nIf clubs used there full squad this wouldn't be an issue either\n\nHAHAHAHAHAHAHA\n\nGetting paid millions to play football twice a week.\n\nFFS üôà\n\nThey should spend that strike time working on a building site or shadowing a nurse in a hospital - get a reality check and some perspective on what real fucking hard work is. They're living the dream with more money than most of us can even comprehend and they can stop working at the ripe old age of 30 and be set for life!\n\nPretty sure my working hours, or the manual labor down the street is much longer than his. Not to mention that we plebs will need to work many more years compared than him before retiring.\n\nTeam 115 also have a much better squad for rotation compared to others.\n\nPlayers: I want to play all the games. I want to earn one years wage every week. \n\nAlso players: too many games. Strike. \n\nWhich is it you want?\n\nDont wanna hear this whiny shit. They get paid an insane amount to play 90 mins twice a week\n\nWell I don't care about workload and them being tired. They earn 1-2 Mio a month so fuck off.\n\nAh shit if Rodri is a comrade I might have to like him...\n\nYet I didn't hear players make a peep about the new CL format.\n\nPay me what they make and I‚Äôll play everyday even if I play like shit and you won‚Äôt hear me complain.\n\nare the people that are lazily attacking Rodri for this unaware of just how stupid congested the schedule really is??? \n\n  \nand that doesn't even take into account that they gotta put on their countries badge 3-4 times a campaign in just friendlies... then let alone when a big international tournament comes around every 2 years\n\nThese are the highest level of football \nOn gigantic wages\nWith the best facilities\nAsked to play 2 times a week\n\nThey can absolutely  request to their intentional  manager to not play  friendlies\nOr just fake an injury, many have done it\n\nOr better yet go to their club manager and complain and say they are playing way to much and need to be rotated\nIt's very simple\nThere's 25 man squads for a reason along with youth players\n\nGo on. \nNobody cares if you don‚Äôt play. \nOther will. \nü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\n\nRidiculous. Hopefully all the subs, reserves and youth counter strike so we have a good video game.\n\nEverton are way ahead of the curve on this one\n\nMaybe players shouldn't sign contracts with clubs that realistically could get 60+ games on the schedule without negotiating a limit of games played per month with their salary proportional to the share of the total games they're on the sheet for. Why don't they?\n\nI'm not gonna argue against the doctors but if you're on ¬£200K a week and complaining about playing two games a week - you can fuck off.\n\nYes, it's all year round but so is the case for every other working human. The difference is they can't retire at any moment if they don't like it.\n\nImagine getting paid as much as them and complaining about having to play every few days. Like dude, you have to run 5-10 miles every fourth day. Get over it. Lots of people run that much every single day\n\nMostly ManCity players complaining, maybe the club should sign more players with big earners adjusting their salary to take a lower pay for fewer games\n\nTrade the whole bench\n\nwould they take say a 10% cut in pay, for 10% reduced workload?\n\nAnd, what the player fails to aknowledge, is this only represents a minority. Those players that play in Europe. 12 Prem teams don't have the issue. Which means getting approval to strike accross the board is going to be near impossible. \n\nEverton players arn't going to sympathise with Man City players.\n\nPfttt  I hope they do. Games gone\n\nRest of the league should go on strike to get the 115 passed. This shit is beyond ridiculous.\n\nIt's all talk, talk, and talk now. They need to back it up some actions if they are serious about it.¬†\n\nI know what would help. Another competition! How about the International Club Peace Cup? 30 games guaranteed for each team, no trophy, and winner gets $20 donated to their chosen charity.\n\nHe got to rest for one match during the last international break üá¨üáÆüá¨üáßüá¨üáÆ\n\nWhat a gimp\n\nHe doesn‚Äôt want to play in The Championship\n\nTo be honest this is better for more aspiring pro footballers. Teams needs bigger squads to rotate players and dilute the salary among most players so not always the same ones are playing and collecting the big fat check. In other words shut the f\\*\\*\\* up rodri.\n\nI think a matches played cap would be helpful. It would force teams to use bench players more and give more players caps against the national team level\n\nA use case for squad rotation and nothing more. \n\nHells bells, if you actually allow for football to be scheduled for the fans, clubs like his would be forced to rotate with youth players for mid week cup games (non-European). I know, I know, this approach may mean non-top six clubs may progress later into the league and FA CUP, but it may reduce the workload on these *overworked* players who have their interest firmly on European and Title\n\nHope they do, FIFA &amp; UEFA need to be checked for their gross negligence around player health\n\nIt's about time they stood up for their rights . Work work and too much overload\n\nBunch of millionaire cry-babies... \"OMG, we'll have to play almost 70 matches a year\" South American clubs, Brazilian clubs especially, play over 70 matches - sometimes it gets close to 80 - yearly since the early 2000s, it's not like you can't handle that with some better organized team schedule... People are only complaining because of the new format of the Club World Cup, which I find quite amazing, to be honest. I don't see many people questioning the stupid new Champions League format that also added a number of matches as well...\n\nHow is playing two games a week even that difficult, these players are Fannie‚Äôs man. You get to retire with millions in the bank before 40 get a fucking grip \n\nMaybe talk to your own managers who hoard some of the worlds best and don‚Äôt rotate\n\nthere's hours of training every day, traveling around Europe twice a week, 10 hours of travelling a week, the physical and emotional toll for running 90 minutes, footballers earning millions doesn't make them invincible\n\nIt‚Äôs short term pain for long term gain\n\nthe body can only take much, there has been an increase of injuries due to the increase of game time"

    "all_comment_text": "Looks like he won't be a cheat code buy for my manager career next year onwards\n\nHe isn‚Äôt that great this year already, they removed his finesse shot playstyles\n\nHaven't played Career Mode since Fifa 23, used to be a solid buy always\n\nIt had reached the point that I'd have to sell him for so less or got no offers because he was worth 700 mil or something (selling because I wanted to change things up)\n\nHow long had he been in Germany growing up? There would be records of him arriving and starting school, that sort of thing. Dental records too. You'd notice if an 8 year old showed up and pretended to be 4, for instance.\n\nOf course, it's different if he came much later, but wiki isn't very informative.\n\nHe was 10 when he moved according to the bundesliga website\n\nSo the accusation is that he was actually 14 when he arrived? \n\nSeems like something that would be noticed. Plus, you would have had to know that he was an absolute top talent already when arriving and filling in the documents, and then deciding to buy him 4 years on paper. \n\nNever say never, but sounds unlikely to me.\n\nPeople did notice, but any accusations were called racist. The biggest red flag was that he was dating an 18 year old when he was 12 (this was confirmed as there was a domestic dispute between them at that age)\n\nHis agents story is that he noticed how good of a player he was in Cameroon, brought him over to Germany under the guise of being his dad and pretended he was 4 years younger\n\nAh well that does change things\n\nI think when this is exposed, we will have a lot of cases. How many times have we seen a ‚Äúwonder kid‚Äù beasting it at youth level, questions about age and the normally retired by mid 20s\n\nI can think of half a dozen off the top of my head. It‚Äôs hidden behind a race angle but surely you can see these are not kids\n\n[deleted]\n\nThey were called racist because it was something consistently done to african players not bullying. How can defending yourself from unwarranted accusations be bullying? How many Europeans get accused of misrepresenting their age? I‚Äôve gone to school with some lads that looked fully grown in high school but never once were they accused of being 27 in the 11th grade lol. Calm down.\n\nBecause there's a clear incentive to fake being a child for immigration purposes, and a generally lower standard of official record keeping in large parts of Africa.\n\nNot contesting any of that but there‚Äôs a larger disparity of Africans being accused of this simply based on the fact they‚Äôre African rather than them factually being older. Even Samuel Etoo was accused of this lol no one is safe.\n\nKanu. Okocha. Were also accused. This might be true for this person specifically, but when so many players get accused, it makes it easier for true culprits to get away with it\n\nMaybe because it only happens in Africa and its a common practice... Eto'o himself even said it's a common practice.\n\nIt happens in the US and the Caribbean for baseball players as well.\n\nYeah, if you remove all common sense then it makes sense to call them racist.\n\nUltimately, you are the only one ignoring facts in favour of emotional insults.\n\nEmotional insults? Did you read what I said? Lol \n\nObviously you cant see what he said because it was so stupid that he deleted it so yea.\n\nPretty sure that's what happened with Freddy Adu.\n\nIt‚Äôs MUCH harder to tell how old people of color are in general due to obvious reasons.\n\nI am trying, _trying,_ to find a way to parse this that isn't massively racist and oh boy is it a struggle. If you were trying to say something more benign and just bungled the phrasing catastrophically, now would be the time to fix it.\n\nYou know the saying 'black don't crack' the commenter must have meant that because all other races have wrinkles at 14 years old\n\nüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇwhy would you type this\n\nWait ... what are the obvious reasons? So confused\n\nThe records of him arriving don't prove his real age, because the parents could've lied or produced fake records. In fact the accusation is that his father is not his real father and falsified his records. \n\nHowever, four years older is a lot. He moved to Germany at 10 which means he would've been 14? No way a 14yo can pass for 10.\n\nNo way? Completely impossible? \n\nYou need to go visit more schools, there are many kids leagues ahead on their development.\n\nExcept he wasn't, there's videos of him dominating against u13 when he's supposedly 10, and he's bigger stronger and faster than everyone, and these aren't just any old kids these are the best youth players in germany\n\nIt depends. For sure, people will doubt his age, but it‚Äôs not unusual for a 10 year old to look like he is 14. Some boys even reach puberty very early and will have some facial hair at 11-12. \n\nSo it‚Äôs not completely unusual. I remember in my school we had 2 kids in our class of 60 who looked way beyond their ages. \n\nHowever, their maturity levels typically will show that they are indeed 10.\n\nYeah I had chest hair at 12, people assumed I was 14/15 all the time at that age too\n\nAs someone who was 5‚Äô5 and had armpit hair before my 11th birthday, can confirm.\n\nMy nephew is huge for his age, he has always been since he was a baby. People often assumed he was 4 or 5 years older than he was. He's now 17 and he's a freaking giant in both height and width (he plays rugby).\n\nOn the other end of the scale, my cousins son has always been small for his age. He played Tiny Tim in A Christmas Carol when he was 15 because he could pass for 8. Which was handy because he was much more capable as an actor than the other candidates.\n\nThere's huge variety when it comes to kids sizes as they grow up.\n\nThe only way to really tell how old each of them actually was, was by talking to them. My nephew was clearly much more of a child than he appeared to be, and my cousins son much more mature.\n\nI live in New Zealand and this is just the average experience for people of European heritage playing rugby against people of Polynesian heritage. They are bigger, stronger, faster and look much older until it mostly evens out in your 20s.  Some races do just develop physical maturity much much faster, and this seems to be the case with many African nations too. \n\nI haven't watched the documentary ; but in general people are acting like age and physical development move in parallel for everyone which just isn't true.\n\nI lived in Trinidad &amp; Tobago for a bit, 4 kids in my class alone were already 6 ft+  by 14. A solid few others amongst the other classes as well and throughout the school in general. Some people just grow at an alarming rate whether its the genes or the region whatever its really wild looking back on it now.\n\nMy 10yr old son (UK) played football against a team with a 6ft lad (African) at same age. I thought he was dropping his own lad off until he ran onto pitch in kit.\n\n‚ÄúYou need to go visit more schools‚Äù. Bro this can be taken completely out of context\n\nI've got a 9 year old daughter that's the size and shape of a 14 year old.\n\nPrecocious puberty gave her the preteen growth spurt when she was about 6.\n\nI always feel sorry for girls who mature early, it must be very tough at times.\n\nMy little girl is 5 next month and already wears the clothes stated for 8 yr/o. Much taller than the other kids in kindergarten.\n\nYeah. That sounds about right. Brace yourself for a 7 year old who has small child tantrums *and* 13 year old tantrums. \n\nIf you figure a way to convince her to wear a bra. Please let us know. Our girl *hates* them.\n\nYes they can. I was 5ft at 14, by 18 I was 6ft 1. Growth spurts happen at different ages.\n\nBet your parents got fed up buying you clothes every two months ü§£\n\nLuckily it was the 90s, the era of incredibly baggy clothes!\n\nSame here\n\nI‚Äôm pretty sure I could have passed for 10 when I turned 14. \n\nThat school year I turned 14 in December and was on the school wrestling team that winter. When the wrestling season began I was the smallest on the team and in the lowest weight category. I was 4‚Äô9‚Äù and 82lbs (144.5cm and 37kg). Looking back at a picture from that start of that year, I was passable for 10, not convincing for 10, but believable. \n\nThat was a tough year. I didn‚Äôt manage to stay on the wrestling team because I think once we started the training, something clicked and I just started growing too fast. \n\nAt a Halloween dance for school there‚Äôs a picture of me on my tiptoes putting bunny ears on a friend who was still taller than me. I took her to the end of year dance and was a few inches taller than her by then even though she was wearing heels. I think I grew 9 inches in about 7 months or something.\n\nOnce played a U12 tournament. The other team was a bunch of 16 year old guys from India. We couldn‚Äôt tell because our 12 year old guy from India had just as much facial hair as these guys. We just thought they were kinda bigger. Which isn‚Äôt uncommon as well\n\nWe only found out cause they where talking about it in Punjabi after the game\n\nI help run a special needs football team. One of the age groups we look after is the under 11s. Plenty of them are over 6 foot. I don‚Äôt imagine they‚Äôd have much trouble getting served, it can be hard to tell.\n\nTen year olds over 6feet? Are you sure?\n\nI‚Äôm sure, it‚Äôs pretty scary when a kid with low emotional control is significantly larger than you. They can be 11 just to be clear, they have to be under 11 at a certain date. Probably unnecessary clarification.\n\nTo be fair difference between 10 and 11 is big from a puberty perspective but I still feel it can‚Äôt be‚Ä¶ unless super kids are gonna take over\n\nThere's a whole family of conditions called OGID syndromes. Overgrowth/Intellectual disability. \n\n\nI don't know if any will make you 180cm at 11, but it's one of those that the world's tallest woman has. So it's not like an extra 5cm or whatever\n\nI‚Äôm not really saying that‚Äôs incorrect- an outlier here and there sure, but a team with plenty of them over 6 foot? I think this guy should get a ruler out aha\n\nThe guy is 5ft 7‚Äô and puts 6ft on his tinder. He‚Äôs forgotten that he isn‚Äôt 6ft in real life when comparing against these kids.\n\nMy son plays youth rugby for Northampton saints. Yes there‚Äôs u10 players who are already pushing 6 foot.\n\nI meet many 10 year olds, and have never seen a boy anywhere near 6ft. Girls at that age can be the size of adults (girls grow earlier), but never seen a 10 year old boy larger than adult males.\n\nOnce they hit 14, many boys are taller than adults, but not at 10.\n\nWith only dental its pretty hard to see the difference between a \"in front of curve 10 year old\" and a \"below the curve 14 year old\".\n\nIf they have any scans of his bones when he is like 14.. its pretty doable imo.\n\nTrust me there is a 10 year old in my 6 year olds class.\n\nI understand because parents want them to get the full education\n\nThis has happened across multiple sports many times. I don‚Äôt get why people act like it‚Äôs impossible and so crazy.\n\nIt's not that it's impossible. It's just there is a trend of it happening to a lot of African players compared to others. For example, Bellingham was dominating players much older than him at 14. By 16 he was playing against adults and still dominating. His age has never been called into question.\n\nIt seems only African players are accused if this. That's why people are skeptical. He could ve guilty,  but there is a long list of African players accused of this including the likes of Etoo, Kanu, Okocha, Adebayor etc.\n\nI would be more concerned by the ones that are dominating youth levels and then suddenly stop developing at adult level. Great players will always be great players, whereas underage players suddenly hit a buffer when they are playing adults\n\nYour premise is just not true. There are lots of plyers who dominate at youth level that do not at the adult level. In fact most don't that's why investing time in youth players is so risky\n\nPeople are asking how no one didn't notice or if it wasn't pretty obvious. Well, people did, but everyone was shot down as a racist. Even here on Reddit, when this case first came to the spotlight. Everyone who said he was probably lying, his fake father/agent lied etc. were also called racist. A lot of people on other subs have pulled the old threads up. Totally switch up now. \n\nHis girlfriend being way older and him refusing to the a bone scan should've been some obvious signs. His fellow countrymen, who were all banned for lying about the age too by Eto.\n\nIn the end, we will see. Someone said in another thread that players who were caught lying later had a massive decline when they hit the 30s.\n\nI think the girlfriend part is probably the best evidence. Kids who appear 4-5 years old than their age, do not behave like they are 4-5 years old, they behave their age and often look like big babies because of it: they look 15 but act like they are 10, because they are 10\n\nEnh some kids are socialized differently. My grandpa got married and started having kids when he was 14. That's just what it was in his day. I kinda get what you're saying, but those kids who work in coal mines at 11-12 probably don't act like normal 11-12 year olds. \n\nThe girlfriend is definitely really weird but I wouldn't say it's a smoking gun or anything like that.\n\n6 years older? A 12 year old who is sexually active is barely news, but getting a girlfriend who is 18 is a bit of a stretch\n\nLook at those middle school teachers who get caught up with their students. It's fucking insane but it happens all the time. As a new parent it's really scary that it's even a thing.\n\nIdk.. I knew people in those situations and it was usually fucked up..\n\nI do too but only with the genders reversed. No doubt there are real cases of women dating kiddos as young as twelve in the out and the open but it is rare.  Combine that with the other reasons to doubt his age and yh‚Ä¶\n\nSo your argument is an adult took advantage of him. That proves your point. What?\n\nNo i meant to say that those things may happen in reality but it would be insanely rare, so given the other doubts around him its more likely that the girlfriend is an indication that he is older than proclaimed\n\nI thought they did bone scans for the youth World Cups, did he not play in those?\n\nPeople don't get that his \"father\" probably just did all this to hurt him because he fell out with him...\n\nDang, again someone who starts off by random rambling and abusive language, isn‚Äôt able to interpret and follow context . I‚Äôm truly surprised /s\n\nTo deny the racism claim you‚Äôd usually counter with proof, which I haven‚Äôt seen yet.\n\nYes there were always rumours, but there was also a birth certificate by a german authority.\n\nYou can claim that you end up correct, that doesn‚Äôt mean though, that accusations made without proof  weren‚Äôt/can‚Äôt be racist.\n\nWhat's the logic that people believe he lied end up being branded as racist. I just don't get the connection. \nOr everything mildly negative about certain people is automatically wrong and you are racist. \nI mean it's pretty funny and also sad how people use the racist card all the time.\n\nIt‚Äôs a fine line, but there was lots of racism of people banging on about the case when there was 0 proof. \n\nCorrect me if I‚Äôm wrong, but you don‚Äôt hear similar stuff about non coloured athletes, at least I don‚Äôt know of an example. \n\nIt‚Äôs the same sentiment as Obama birthers, or Freddy Adu or whoever - always comes up when coloured athletes decline early or look older etc. it‚Äôs a cesspool for racists, hard not to recognise.\n\n&gt; Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, but you don‚Äôt hear similar stuff about non coloured athletes\n\nI mean it's not about coloured-non coloured athletes. It's specially about african athletes because we simply have seen more african atheletes faked their age than other ethnics or nationalities. If we have seen more european atheletes faking their ages than others, people would be more skeptical towards them when it comes to this cases as well\n\nHow many cases have there been ? I don‚Äôt know about any confirmed one to be honest. \n\nAlso taking a low sample, comparing it to another ethnic group and making a general negative statement about it, is the definition of racism.\n\nThat‚Äôs like saying coloured people are more violent based on the colour of there skin, backing it up with ‚Äúdata‚Äù\n\n'African people' is not a race or ethnic group. There are many races and ethnicity in Africa continent which also includes 'non-coloured people' as you describe. Also there are many African countries who has beeen making strict laws around this issue and try to combat it. Props to them. For example there were 62 football players have been suspended from the domestic league for double identification or age fraud in Cameroon\n\nhttps://www.insideworldfootball.com/2024/03/12/cameroon-fa-acts-age-cheats-disqualifying-62-players/\n\nWhy make this comment? Why come to this train of thought? Why continue to dig yourself a bigger ditch? \n\nIt‚Äôs clear as day and has been that he is not the age he claims. Use your critical thinking skills to piece two and two together if you even have any.\n\nDude what are you even talking about digging a bigger ditch ?? Then show me the proof if it‚Äôs so clear ? \n\nHe‚Äôs got a birth certificate by a German authority, that is proof that would hold up in a court - now your proof please\n\nI‚Äôm asking for proof as to how denying such is racist.\n\nUnderstanding context doesn‚Äôt seem to be your strong suit.\n\nNowhere did I say anywhere that \n\nA) asking for proof is the issue\nB) said that it‚Äôs inherently racist.\n\nAlso it‚Äôs not his burden to proof his age\n\nTo deny the racism claim you‚Äôd usually counter with proof, which I haven‚Äôt seen yet.\n\nYes there were always rumours, but there was also a birth certificate by a german authority.\n\nYou can claim that you end up correct, that doesn‚Äôt mean though, that accusations made without proof  weren‚Äôt/can‚Äôt be racist.\n\nThese are your words. Did you forget what you typed out?\n\nNo and I stand by them, but you don‚Äôt seem to understand them/the context\n\nI think you had a lapse in memory. Now you resort to the childish defense of ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt know what I am talking about‚Äù despite it being clear as day in text.\n\n&gt;proof\n\nHe refused an age test. There is your proof.\n\nSame as Breno if you remember, guessing in that case you focussed about the downsides of doing said test?\n\nIf he were truly the age he claims, he would've done the test and silenced all doubters.\n\nHe did not, therefore he is guilty.\n\nInteresting interpretation of the law, sounds like you made a good choice with your club.\n\nYour low intellect amuses me.\n\nSo‚Ä¶ you avoided the Breno topic, what were your thoughts about that back then ? And did you make as much noise as now ?\n\nThis is like saying if I refuse to let Police search my house without a warrant. I must be hiding something\n\nI mean, despite all of the fallout, it makes sense.\n\nHe played with u17s when he was 14 and it kinda blended in.\n\nSo did Lukaku\n\nThe whole \"Lukaku is older than he claims\" thing was hilarious, given that he was born in and grew up in Belgium as the son of a top flight footballer. \n\nI was convinced he'd be one of the all time greats. Shame he ended up at Chelsea and United!\n\nHe is an all time great. All time top scorer for Belgium.\n\nYes lets not put the club failures of utd and chelsea on his cv, top scorer in what was called their golden generation ie he the golden boy\n\nLukaku's story is baffling since he got so big so quickly in spite of his mum topping his cereal up with water because they couldn't afford milk. Having to bring his birth certificate to matches to prove to other parents he was the age they said he was. Must have been very tough for him growing up.\n\nJude Bellingham played with older players. Kobe Mainoo is doing that now. There is a striker playing for Manchester United Obi Martin scoring like 7 goals against kids his age etc. Are these also proof of foul play,\n\nYou guys should see the South Sudan U17 , buncha 30 year olds üòÇüòÇüòÇ\n\nWasn't he supposed to be the next superstar.\n\nTaribo West had about 3 different ages, depending on who asked.\n\nwhy\n\nSupposedly his father signed a statutory declaration that he is not his biological father, and that he is actually 4 years older than his birth certificate says. But he also previously declared that he is the father.\nIn any case there is now speculation again over potential matches that he would have not been eligible to play in, transfer fees and salaries that he would not have gotten if he were older, etc.\n\nDortmund's response was to simply restate that they have officiall documents issued by German authorities as a legal base.\n\nBecause he comes from the streets of Cameroun, a country where faking your age to get a sporting contract is common practice.\n\nIt happens in many countries in Africa. There‚Äôs so many players that you can clearly see are way older than the age they claim. But It‚Äôs not just Africa though. And it‚Äôs not just in sports.\n\nIt happens in Asia as well. I question many of the North Korean footballers over the years and those who played and won the recent FIFA U20, and U17 girls competitions. They appear older, were bigger, faster, and very matured in their playing and dominated everyone. I doubt FIFA is giving scans to every team and player to determine if they‚Äôre tell the truth. https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=762383040471508&amp;id=436728946370254&amp;set=a.762381937138285\n\nTaye taiwo the Nigerian defender who when he was about 24 was rumoured to have a twin who was 5/6 years older. Literally the whole country was saying it.\n\nThat was bullshit, the twin was supposedly 12 years older, and it was exposed as fake. If the story was true and he was 12 years older than he said that would mean he was able to start 27 games in the Finnish league aged 46 and keep playing until he was 49.\n\nThat‚Äôs what people are saying though lol. That he did play in the Finnish league at that age. That league is terrible. He was a Champions League level player in his pomp.\n\nHis real age is why - supposedly at around age 28 - he completely fell off a cliff as a player. He was moving like he was 40.\n\nSure the Finnish league is poor, but it's not Sunday league. A player of his calibre having the fitness to start nearly every game for a top Finnish team at 46 is not believe to me.\n\nFor a player of the level he was in his prime, yes, it may as well be Sunday league. There are levels, as they say. \n\nIn terms of fitness, that‚Äôs not what you lose. You lose the explosiveness. The yard in pace over 5 yards that makes the difference at the top level. However, you move down the levels and the extra yards in your head and the extra yard with your know-how and superior touch etc make up for it.\n\nThe worst thing about it is how right wingers take this as a basis to spread their bullshit‚Ä¶\nLooking under YouTube comments on videos with that topic, it‚Äôs literally disgusting what they are saying.\n\nMeanwhile no one really knows what‚Äôs up, but the biggest idiots around claim to know everything for sure.\n\nWhat about left wingers, like Sterling and Raphinha?\n\nThought the same üòÖ\n\nBut does Rodrygo count as a rw or a lw?\n\nHe‚Äôs a centrist striker\n\nIs it really bullshit if its true ?\n\nYes spreading racist prejudice stays bullshit no matter the moukoko outcome.\n\nIt didn't help that he started dating an 18 year old when he was supposedly 12 lol. What 18 year old dates a 12 year old kid?\n\nA 12 year old on top of his game.\n\nAgain, no matter if moukoko lied about his age or not is no justification to claim racist bullshit about the whole of Africa as example‚Ä¶\nHow can you not agree to that?\n\nEdit: on a side note, I‚Äôm not saying doubting moukoko makes you a racist. But apparently people think racism is cool in the right circumstances. Ok.\n\nWell, there is frequent age fraude from African countries? Just check Cameroon who just suspended 62 of their own players for age fraude? What is even the discussion here?\n\nMoukoko might not be older, but age fraude does definitely happen primarily with players from African countries.\n\nIt happens from players that come from poor countries that want to get any chance available to them. It happens in any sport. Of course I am not with any side here. \n\nThe bad thing is that everyone that was questioning that was called a racist and now the right wingers are taking advantage fo that to start their propaganda... I feel like both sides fail miserably...\n\nYes it happens due to African players getting more or less blackmailed into it. ‚ÄúEither you do that, or your career is over‚Äù. That‚Äôs how it works. Inform yourself, they aren‚Äôt necessarily lying because they want to, they are forced by fraudulent agents.\n\nAlso I‚Äôm not claiming that being septic of moukoko makes you a racist. But posting monkey emojis is def. Racist. How are you guys so freaking butthurt to accept racism isn‚Äôt cool and going full defense mode assuming it can‚Äôt be racism in yt comments?\n\nYou are making up arguments that have nothing to do with me or this discussion. I have not made a single racist remark and it's quite sad to resort to even tying this discussion to that. It's based on previous examples, not prejudice. \n\nI am just a football fan stating something every football fan knows. You said there is no reason to suspect age fraude for African players and i gave very recent evidence that this does occur more frequently than we might suspect.\n\nThe reason behind it doesn't matter in this discussion, just that it does.\n\nI didn‚Äôt say you are a racist lol.\n\nI said there is racism in YouTube comments.\nWhy does that trigger all of you?\n\n\"You guys\" \"all of you\" why you certainly are piling me up with the same people making those monkey emojis lol.\n\n&gt;I said there is racism in YouTube comments\n\nWhat response are you hoping for from that? \n\nRacism is bad, and we all know that.\n\nYou didn't even say what racist claims anyone is making.\n\nCorrect, why assume it can‚Äôt be racism then?\n\nSure, it's just as valid as saying it's not racism. \n\nSince you didn't say what exactly upsets you people fill in the blanks, and their experience not reading racism into it is just as valid as yours.\nYou're likely just thinking about different comments.\n\nNo. I said there is racism in YT comments below videos about him. Going full nuclear claiming that can‚Äôt be without any clue what I‚Äôm referring to is just stupid.\n\nAs if that was so unlikely. Ever been to YouTube comments?\n\nMeh, maybe, maybe not.\n\nYou didn't provide context thus you get people talking about different things.\n\n[removed]\n\nSo I‚Äôm wrong saying racism is bad no matter what? lol.\n\nEdit: the irony from this comment originating from a burner account with zero comments or posts. Apparently you can‚Äôt handle the heat either\n\nIt‚Äôs not racism if you say you have to be careful about the age when you put players from Africa under contract because birth dates can easily be faked in Africa.\n\nThey are faked in Africa because European agents make a business from abusing African talents. Just google ‚ÄúSilas VfB Stuttgart‚Äù dude didn‚Äôt have access to his own papers and was dependent of his fraudulent agent giving him a little money to survive.\n\nAlso what I‚Äôm referring to is real racist stuff. Calling out someone like lukaku for equally lying because he‚Äôs black and had a big body at young age.\nPosting monkey emojis. All that stuff.\n\nI agree with your first paragraph, the second one is not on topic but I agree aswell. \n\nMy point is that clubs have to be careful when signing African players and check if their birthdate is correct.\n\nAlso, European agents wouldn‚Äôt be able to ‚Äûmake business‚Äú if African parents kept track off their child‚Äôs age and didn‚Äôt lie about it to the agents or the clubs.\n\nI very much doubt moukoko is 20 years old and I also doubt that his parents don‚Äôt know his real age.\n\nIf he‚Äôs 24 as alleged and which seems realistic this was terrible for a lot of youth players that had to face him which in my opinion is the biggest issue here. Imagine the hundreds of 10-14 year olds he played against when he was 14-18 years old that felt like shit after getting destroyed by someone allegedly their age.\n\nWas this guys agent European? Didn't he traffic him under pretence of being his dad?\n\nTbh not sure where the agent is from, Europe is just the place to make the most money as an agent so it‚Äôs the most likely. But he‚Äôs not his dad.\n\nhttps://www.beinsports.com/en-us/soccer/bundesliga/articles/stuttgarts-silas-confesses-to-false-identity\n\nThose scrutinising the player were right. People like you backpedal and try to act like you are still somehow right by making up irrelevant arguments. It is not racist to recognise patterns and question legitimately\n\nEdit: joined Reddit very recently and don‚Äôt need to flex that I‚Äôm a 24/7 user\n\nWhat are you saying people are wrong about? Black people lie about their age? You sound nuts\n\nIt‚Äôs really common in Africa and nowhere else in the world. It‚Äôs not about race, it‚Äôs about an environment where personal data is tracked so poorly that some people try to benefit from faking the age of people.\n\nIt would happen anywhere in the world if the environment would allow it, it just so happens that this kind of crime is most common in Africa because of poor data tracking.\n\nBro you realize Cameroon just suspended 60 of their own players for lying about their age? Yes African players have lied about their age for a long time.  No not every African player does this, but if a player lies about their age 99% chance he's from an African country. Just facts.\n\nNo, poor countries (mostly in Africa) where it's easy to falsify your records because they do very poor tracking. It's a thing.\n\n[removed]\n\nYour claim that it's okay to spread bullshit\n\nIf its true, its not bullshit. If its made up its bullshit. Hope this helps\n\nThe bullshit I‚Äôm referring to is posting ape emojis or claiming other black players surely have done the same in the past, like as example lukaku. So yeah, my point stands. It remains racist bullshit.\n\nYou really want to defend that?\n\nNo, that‚Äôs not true. The worst thing here is the fraud. Not some idiots saying stupid stuff. But the clear fraud and I want to know who was involved and if Zorc or Watzke knew\n\nWouldn‚Äôt Dortmund also be victims in this? Be different if they had punted him for many millions I suppose.\n\nThat‚Äôs the interesting question. Who was part of the scam? Who made a profit? And who is the victim in all of this? Despite the fans, the sponsors and of course the other teams and players, especially youth players\n\nRacists love to hide behind plausible deniability, and more and more lately I've seen people giving it to them\n\nYou say that but at this point to deny that age fraud is a thing is pure gaslighting. You haven‚Äôt got the moral high ground here\n\nCan you show me where I denied that?\n\nYeah I forgot that random Nigerians on their forums are right-wingers\n\nWhile you're at it, check Bellingham too /j\n\nThere‚Äôs been a few cases like this before..\n\nI‚Äôm thinking Kanu, Emmanuel Adebayor, \nObafemi Martins were all accused of the same thing.  With Martins I could certainly believe that he was much older than he was!\n\nMost don‚Äôt even get a pro career. They just fizzle out as soon as their age is 17/18 and their careers are over entirely by 25\n\nhttps://amp.dw.com/en/age-fraud-how-african-football-is-trying-to-combat-it/a-64978227\n\nTheir careers don‚Äôt match a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù career where you don‚Äôt see players peak as teenagers and then dropping huge levels by their 30th birthday\n\nAlthough Martins had rumours about him for years, I sing think he is a case of this as he was still decent well into his 30s.\n\nTaye Taiwo, Taribo West and Stephen Appiah are more likely. Brilliant until their late 20s then fell off a cliff and started to move like they were 42.\n\nMartins was just strong, but no way I‚Äôm believing he was as young as stated and he was kind of done by 30\n\nDid this not happen to another player a few years ago? I‚Äôve forgot his name.\nNothing Germany or dortmund could‚Äôve gone they get the documents they are legally obliged to attain, they don‚Äôt know if they are forged.\nLove to get a documentary on this.\n\nI think you‚Äôre right. Silas Wamangituka ended up not being who he was initially said to be and was like 3 years older than stated? Or something like that at least\n\nFunny how it's never white folk that are subjected to this bs, innit?\n\nWhat are you trying to say? That Africa isn't known for age fraud in football?\n\nThis type of comment is used to silence people.\n\nBecause their countries have robust systems to prevent age fraud\n\nIt‚Äôs kind of crazy seeing this happen in football when it‚Äôs been happening with Latin American players in baseball for years\n\nWoefully overlooked points include: \n -20 years ago was 2004 (!!!)\n-he was born in the capital of Cameroon, not some  remote village or tiny municipality \n\nDetermining the year, if not exact date, of his birth shouldn‚Äôt be a damn Agatha Christie novella.\n\nI have no idea what your point is so I‚Äôm not surprised it‚Äôs woefully overlooked.\n\nI think it means that it must be well documented since he was born in an important city\n\nIf he is really that age, why hasn't he ever submitted to an age test?\nWhy does it seem like he has stagnated significantly for someone that should just be exploding right now with all.of his talent?\n\nLike cutting him up and counting his rings?\n\nNo it's an x-ray of the hand and some measurements\n\nThat has a margin error of at least two years because humans are not machines. They didn't claim he was ten while being twenty in reality.\n\nThere are no scientifically sound tests for age. X rays of bones are extremely flawed and based on quack science, often used against migrants and asylum seekers. Western world just cannot move on from eugenics science.\n\nDNA Methylation is the most accurate, that still isn‚Äôt 100% accurate and is invasive as it‚Äôs cited that bone marrow testing is the most accurate way to do this.\n\nYeah because players never stagnate even when young‚Ä¶??? What is this bullshit logic.\n\nWhy would a 24 year old ‚Äústagnate‚Äù it‚Äôs not like he‚Äôs a pensioner if he‚Äôs actually 24\n\n2024. People still believe this tripe.\n\nWhat makes it so unbelievable lmao\n\nWho cares. Can he perform?  Then so what.\n\nBecause he was playing in the under 21s when he was allegedly 25, for example.\n\nNah I‚Äôm with the commenter, who cares!? Anyway, brb getting ready for my Under 6 boxing match. Wish me luck!\n\n*right hook to jaw sends little Luca flying across the ring*\n\n\"Yeah, who's laughing now? Little shit\"\n\nPlayers are assets, if hes not as valuable an asset it has huge ramifications for the club and player.\n\nI don't know exactly the details but talking in general about age lies.\n\nIf an 18 year old boy shared the same locker room as my 14 year old child, as a father, at least I would be pretty worried.\n\nAs a football fan he probably destroyed the Dortmund dream of another 18-20 years old child who had to go to a random second class team because this liar prodigy took his place.\n\nIf the age lie is real, he should be perma banned by FIFA and fined, this should be no joke.\n\n&gt;18-20 years old child\n\n18-20 year old child?\n\nNaive"

    "all_comment_text": "&gt;Can they do 5? \n\nThey will be major favorites. Obviously they can and likely will, barring punishment from the league in the form of point deductions.\n\n* future predictions are dependent upon oil prices\n\nMoney certainly is a factor,  but it did nothing if you don't have a person in the helm that can build a team.\n\nBut Pep very likely wouldnt have gone to City if they didnt have the money\n\nSo what?\n  \nWe have a lot more examples of teams who gotten a lot of money with nothing,  or very little,  to show for it than the other way around.\n\nHave we had any examples where a club had infinite money though? Or was willing to pay players under the table to land their ideal squad every single time?\n\nAbout the only time they didn‚Äôt land their man was Kane and instead they threw hundreds of millions at Haaland instead.\n\nAlso they talk about their net spend in the past 5yrs but conveniently forgot the money spent before which is still the foundation of their squad.\n\nSure, 40mil for Bernardo, 40mil for Stones, 50mil for Walker, 55mil for KDB, 60mil for Dias (or whatever the exact costs were) doesn't sound too horrendous by 2024 fees but they were bought 5+ years ago when that was outrageous money! They have the highest wage bill by a mile and the highest paid manager!\n\nOnce you have a good team it‚Äôs easy to keep it. Indeed.\n\nWhat exactly is this point meant to say? Like do you think it‚Äôs some gotcha? Other teams legitimately earned a ton of money and wasted it. City cheated to get money and spent it well.\n\nDoesn‚Äôt change the fact the money is the big difference lol\n\nEh?\n\n\nYeah but \"these other teams with money\" ain't state owned and in the business of sportswashing.\n\n\nNot the same thing at all.\n\na person which in turn costs a fuck ton of money\n\nDoes his salary include a 48% stake for his brother in a Club in a different country ?\n\noh lol, I did not know this, thanks for sharing. The corruption is endless.\n\nIrish United fan losing interest because his chosen team is no longer dominating? \n\nWho'da thought. Its almost like your interest / fandom was based on United not being shit.\n\nI‚Äôm English, have followed the PL my entire life and always used to love it, and I am bored out of my mind by nation states winning trophies. It sucks big time.\n\nI‚Äôve found it very refreshing to follow the lower leagues.\n\nOr following leagues of countries with weaker leagues.\n\nI‚Äôm English, have followed the PL my entire life and always used to love it. And I am excited to live in a time when the title is decided on the last day, that smaller clubs like Villa, Newcastle and City can get top 4 and win the league.\n\nIf points are deducted, then they should be applied to the seasons that the infractions occurred shouldnt they? It would make no sense to apply them next season. If found guilty I have a feeling they wont have done 4 in a row anymore.\n\n&gt;barring punishment from the league in the form of point deductions.\n\nMy guess is that the league wants to wait until their streak ends - or at least looks pretty much guaranteed to end - before applying any deduction.\n\nAny time the bookies give you good odds on city not winning, put money on city winning. I did it last year when arsenal went something like 8 points ahead.\n\nHow'd you make out with it after?\n\nI bet ¬£50 and won ¬£290.\n\nSound buddy. Not a bad haul.\n\nHe probably used tongue\n\nWin-win situation tbh\n\nMy favourite bets are for things that I don‚Äôt want to happen.\n\nGreat article in The Guardian yesterday talking about how this predictability is by design.¬† The writer called it the Billionairification of football.¬†¬†\n\n\n¬†For profits to be assured, predictability is essential. No surprises.¬†\n\n\nHe gave multiple examples of how things are being managed at UEFA level and downwards to ensure this procession if profit.¬†¬†\n\n\n¬†Any pretence of sporting integrity was lost when they set up the Champions League. Its TV audiences and \"content\" which takes priority.¬†\n\nThe spice must flow\n\nLink? Sounds a great read üëç\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/may/18/billionaires-and-banter-wars-modern-footballs-script-is-stuck-in-a-loop\n\nCheers\n\nCity have won the same amount if titles in the last 7 years as PSG. That's a crazy stat\n\nWasn‚Äôt this also true of United in the 90‚Äôs and 2000‚Äôs\n\nThere's a huge difference. United were winning with few points in their streaks and were not owned by a limitless state that can put gazillions into the club whenever without care. They will treat this like Qatar treats PSG and will own it without selling since it's not an individual or simple corporation that's looking for profit first. Some dark times.\n\nUtd were still outspending everyone though and that played a big part. Ofc once other big players started doing the same(Chelsea &amp; city) Utd suddenly dropped off\n\nUnited primarily dropped off because of Ferguson leaving, not because Chelsea came in \n\nUnited won three premier leagues in a row after oil-rich Chelsea won two. They also won the title in 2013, right after City won their first. \n\nWhile true that United did outspend everyone, it‚Äôs a bit different when it‚Äôs not funded by breaking FFP rules and earned through success (not an Oil rich nation)\n\nMassive investment laid the groundwork on which that success was built. They then were able to capitalise with the rise of the Premier league.\n\nThere were no FFP rules for united to break though.\n\nThat‚Äôs true fergie leaving had a big impact, that‚Äôs another controversial story itself. \n\nEh kind of, when Utd were spending FFP wasn‚Äôt a thing and then when it did come in it locked in their ability to continue spending frivolously because lower clubs couldn‚Äôt do the same even if they wanted to like Newcastle now for example. \n\nDon‚Äôt get me wrong, city did break the rules and deserve punishment but it‚Äôs also silly the way people talk like the other big clubs before city are some kind of saints lol\n\nThey really don‚Äôt deserve punishment. It‚Äôs just financial gatekeeping. Like why is it fair that clubs like united were allowed to do whatever they want and then the league decides ‚Äúhang on, let‚Äôs make rules that make it borderline impossible for anyone to become successful by saying it‚Äôs cheating to do what all of these other clubs have been doing for decades‚Äù. That‚Äôs like saying that rape or murder are only wrong starting‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ now! Financial\nDoping is total bullshit and acting like it‚Äôs cheating is ignorant when it was legal for decades and no one cared. It‚Äôs anti competitive\n\nUnited outspent everyone and still outspend city now so this entire comment is nonsense.\n\nThis is hilarious.\n\nUnited had unlimited funds compared to everyone else. They dominated the same way Cory are now, with great players being paid a lot of money led by a GOAT manager.\n\nThey also won 13 of 21 years from the 90‚Äôs through 2010s, including a stretch where they won 7-9.\n\nCity now have 8-13. If you count their best streak of 7 they won 7-12 during that time.\n\nUnited‚Äôs presence back that was MASSIVE and they did it through massive funds, amazing players (including Ronaldo ffs, among a laundry list of other GOATS), and a GOAT manager.\n\nSo, farmers league ?\n\nConfirmed.\n\nSame winner every year, no-one getting past cl quarters.\n\nPremier league teams won the champions league in 2019, 2021 and 2023.\n\n2 of those being all English finals as well üòÇ\n\nChelsea in 20/21 and City in 22/23 lol.\n\nJust one year cannot decide it, can it?\n\nProbably being slightly harsh on the European front but we are at risk of city just running away with it each year.\n\nArsenal dropped 4 points in 2024 and that still wasn't enough.\n\nwell once newcastle is allowed to spend more money because they have balanced thier nation state budget and make ffp rules they will also be like city so maybe there will be a 2 team dominance.\n\ni will be jacks complete lack of suprise then\n\nSo the Premier League won‚Äôt be like Bundesliga will be like La Liga.\n\nWhat was it like before? The PL isn‚Äôt as competitive as you all think it is. Man U dominated before and in the last 13/14 years it has been city. Most leagues have some examples of an outsider winning but the reality is that the winning team is very predictable.\n\nPeople acting like Abramovich didn't buy himself a bunch of titles in the early noughties\n\nYeah football just generally is pretty predictable, the whole \"premier league is competitive\" is nothing more than a farce when you look at the results. More teams in la liga have ended top 3 than in the prem, its not a competitive league.\n\nTrue\n\nIt's becoming one\n\nIt has been for a while now. Man City wins, Arsenal or Liverpool close behind. Newly promoted sides don‚Äôt survive. At least 2/3. Relegation sides fighting for 16-20. The big 6 always at least top 8. Newcastle now considered a top 8 side. West Ham and Brighton top 10. Rest of the league is fighting for 11-15. \n\nBoring and predictable. Villa was the only surprise this season.\n\nYeah Villa was only bigger suprise but this type of suprise is in every league Stuttgart second Girona + Bologna champions with Brest maybe will also make champions league all of this is bigger suprise than Villa finishing top 4\n\nthen thier talent will be taken from them and back dow nthey go. a tale as old as time\n\nGirona is City\n\nMinority owned by City but they did not spend any crazy ammounts for players\n\nI wouldnt call a split between Peps brother and the CFG a minority tbh.\n\nAll 3 stayed up last year?\n\n&gt;Newly promoted sides don‚Äôt survive.\n\nThere have only been two seasons in PL history in which all three promoted sides got immediately relegated.\n\nWe‚Äôve finished in the top 10 exactly twice, and last year broke the top 6 which was a very unpredictable outcome.\n\nHow was Villa a surprise? They went from 17 to 7 last season with emery. With a full season, It‚Äôs clear they were gonna compete for the top 6.\n\nSure, the final outcome was predictable. But the way it happened wasn‚Äôt at all. People kept expecting Arsenal to fall away every month and City go on to cruise it. Neither of those things happened.\n\nPL fans when Real Madrid loses the league to Barcelona by a single point: lol so predictable, shit league with no competition.  \nPL fans when City wins for the fourth time in a row and the sixth time in seven years: see, the PL is not predictable even though it may seem that way, let me explain....\n\nPeople supporting ‚Äúleagues‚Äù is a dumb concept first and foremost. Do yourself a favour and avoid people like that, and then you wouldn‚Äôt get so wound up by people making reasonable observations. \n\nNot sure why you want to try and start another one of those pointless PL v LL debates.\n\nDon't support a league, just support a team\n\nThen aim to win anything and everything all the time, not caring for the other's success or failures\n\nSo you ignored Bar√ßa and R Madrid over the decades but chose the Premier League over 7 years? Interesting comparative analysis.\n\nMan City lost game last time in premier league on 6th december and since than they draw only 4 games so that is about thier form\n\nSince the turn of the year Arsenal went 16-1-1. It‚Äôs not like Arsenal weren‚Äôt doing extraordinary things at the same time.\n\nYes that part was wrong but Man City did meet thier expectations so that part of fan prediction was right\n\nwhy is everyone ignoring that liverpool led by four points 6-8 weeks ago. if it wasn‚Äôt for ‚Äúklopp leaving‚Äù i would have put their odds at 50-50. \n\nultimately klopp lost the locker room during his departure\n\nPersonally, I think that normally works the other way around in those scenarios. Take Wenger leaving Arsenal for example, it became a motivation to win everything possible for a man that did great things by the club. (Sadly nothing was) Klopp‚Äôs group would have been no different in that regard. In hindsight it looks that way, but honestly they just looked so resource depleted compared to both Arsenal and Man City, and if anything the fact that we can still mention Liverpool‚Äôs relevance in the race today is testament to how much they were overachieving with the squad they had this year. It was never going to be 50:50 when they had a new challenge of having to try and outlast Arsenal on top of dealing with their medium-term, machine-like rival City.\n\nMy heart bleeds for Arsenal, so this sucks.\n\nI've lost a lot of interest in the Premier League because of City. \n\nWatched it my whole life, missed a lot of events and got into a lot of arguments with girlfriends over the years because I didn't want to miss matches.\n\nBut when a team can cheat then what's the point? Especially when they are allowed to get away with it. \n\nPeople jack off to Pep but he's just as complicit. He always uses the same bullshit line about how he's been assured no cheating happened. But when everyone over the age of 12 can see how much City cheated then he's either an absolute moron or he's happy to play along with the cheating.\n\nThem winning the champions league was a nail in the coffin. I'm sure City fans will talk about 4 in a row but I doubt anyone else or there sees it as anything other than cheating. I'll never recognise anything City have won a legitimate.\n\n[deleted]\n\nIt's boring in terms of being a competition, and money has totally destroyed it.\n\nI'd been all over the country following my league side, huge midweek away trips, done abour half the legaue groubds.This coming season is the first in 30 I've not renewed my season ticket - interest has been waning due to the money, constant cheating and time wasting and just the fact football today seems to bring out more arseholes and insane amounts of anger and bickering, especially on social media.\n\nMy interest in football has regressed to following non-league. At least you can have a pint while you're watching.\n\nI feel the same way mate, I just can't be bothered anymore and feel a bit indifferent to it these days. Even if legally, it's proven man city did nothing wrong it doesn't take genius to see that what they've been doing is wrong.\n\nWhoa whoa! Cheating? They just have a very good accounting team; loopholes.üòÖ\n\nPep has been a cheater all his life. As a player he doped. In Barcelona they had Negreira, in Bayern they cheat their opponents off their star players and then we have Man City, which is cheating to another level.\n\n&gt;As a player he doped\n\n\nBayern's club doctor implied it may be more than just as a player, labelling the recovery time of his players at Barcelona as being quicker than humanly possible\n\nYes, but there isn‚Äôt any evidence to that so I didn‚Äôt mention it. But yeah, I remember that team was super human (physically). They found some stuff when Operation Puerto (I think it was) happened but it was quickly hushed, as plenty of those players were part of Spains winning national team.\n\nI recomend getting into the brazilian league, its the only league that have at least 12 teams thet can win each year, and a team can go from champions to relegarion in less than 10 years, also have lots of young talents, last year recently promoted gremio ended up in second\n\nThe Brazilian League used to be something extremely fierce back a long time ago. To this day, people complain about Pele not playing in the European leagues in an attempt to tarnish his wonderful records, but then, the Brazilian sides Pele played on consistently smashed them to pieces (against all their stars like Cryff, Di Stefano, etc.) during friendlies and multiple World Cups over and over again. They produced all that talent and history, but yeah, sure, \"it's nowhere near as competitive or as good as Europe\".\n\nGiven they've now added making indirect payments to premier league referees it's gone beyond a joke. The league is dead\n\nI'm completely out of the loop, haven't been following the PL for the last few years, can someone fill me in on how they cheated? Genuinely curious\n\nGoogle \"Man City 115\" and you'll find plenty to read. Below is a link to one from the BBC:\n\nhttps://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cgrjv9ydv31o\n\nDon't worry, they'll get kicked from the league soon enough. No way they haven't broken a billion financial regulations over the years.\n\nSo chelsea will be kicked as well right?\n\nCan think of 115 reasons things may change...\n\nThat‚Äôs now six in the last seven league titles for Man City. The Premier League is turning into the Bundesliga.\n\nUnited had a stretch of 7-9. On their way to 13-21, during which multiple winners between each United PL champ happened exactly 1 time.\n\nArsenal need to reinforce to continue challenging, and will be the closest to challenge City.\n\nCan't see any other team challenging City tbh. Liverpool have a new manager, Chelsea are too inconsistent and don't have high calibre players to sustain a league campaign, Spurs are spurs and United are in a perpetual state of rebuild.\n\nNon Liverpool and Feyenoord fans don‚Äôt seem to appreciate Arne Slot currently appears to just be Jurgen Klopp 2.0 with minor differences\n\nI think arsenal , united and Chelsea will build on from this season . They ( united and Chelsea ) won't challenge for title yet but they will be capable of taking points from city .\n\nArsenal it remains to be seen how badly they get affected from the euros .\n\n For Liverpool it will be interesting aside from a new manager they are restructuring their entire backroom , however this is not something new to slot almost every club he's gone to has been under similar or worse conditions and he always has gone off to a banging start . It remains to be seen if he can continue his own streak.\n\nSpurs could improve under ange but you have completely forgotten villa , they have played extremely well against top 6 and could be another side to take points of city. \n\nI think next year the league will be very very competitive.\n\nTrue, any of Emerys teams should not be underestimated, although my point was about longevity and consistency over the course of a season. Only City have the experience and squad for it. If arsenal have a good transfer window I think they may go one step further next year .\n\nI'm fucking bored of the PL. Millions of others are, too.\n\nChampionships where it‚Äôs at. Should break away and call it the British League and open it up to any team within the home nations. \n\nLet‚Äôs teams in the PL follow their dream of being stuck in an NFL style borefest.\n\nThis is basically the opposite of the NFL. Every single NFL team has the exact same financial resources to work with. You don‚Äôt really gain an advantage by having a rich owner.¬†\n\nLets be honest City could do 10 in a row at this point. Unless someone does a Xavi Alonso I don't see how any could stop them.\n\nXabi*\n\nthnx\n\nAssuming that the charges against City predictably fizzle out and lead to no repercussions, in 10-15 years the PL will be a dying one-team league and it will be seen as a miracle that Klopp not only won but repeatedly came close against that club, while working under owners who insist on self-sufficiency.\n\nThis next couple of years are probably going to be the most important for English football. Either City are charged and there‚Äôs a drastic change of the rules or we go down the path you mentioned.\n\n[deleted]\n\nExactly their bench is prolly more expensive than any mid table teams first team\n\nTheir bench is more expensive than every Starting XI in the league aside from their own, Arsenals, Liverpools, Chelsea‚Äôs and Man Utd‚Äôs.\n\n115\n\nIt‚Äôs the only Big 4 league which went to the last day, look at the point margins in the other leagues\n\nBut i think this was the most predictable years basically i felt entire season that Man City was going to win beceause even last season i felt when Arsenal had 8 point lead they were going to win premier league and nobody was saying last year  how ultra competive league 1 is' when PSG won by one point\n\nThe reason City were still favorites last season when Arsenal were up 8 points is because City had a game in hand, realistically cutting the lead to 5 points. Then Arsenal had a game against City during the run in, where City were the favorites to win. So realistically that 8 point lead was only 2 points. Not much room for error when defending such a minor lead against the strongest team in the world\n\nThe other Leagues were also predictable besides the Bundesliga, but it going to the final day doesn‚Äôt really matter when you know that City are still most likely to win it considering they have another top 4 teams in their backup to account for fatigue and injuries\n\nSo? It's the only league where you can predict the winner before the season starts. Margins don't matter.\n\nLet‚Äôs not pretend Madrid, Inter and PSG weren‚Äôt all extremely likely to win the league this year. The only massive surprise was Bayern not following suit.\n\nHow do margins not matter? This year was settled by a single result, things obviously could have gone differently.\n\nYeah, I'm sure nobody could have predicted Real Madrid or PSG winning their leagues.\n\nIt went to the last day but it was still predictable.\n\nWe are the farmer's league now and it deserves to be.\n\nSomeone once said, ‚ÄúOil money from Qatar buys wins‚Äù\n\nOh behave. When Fergie won his first title with United they went on to win 8/13. City have just equalled that today to make it 8/13.\n\nIf city had lost today they would have been less dominant in the last 13 years than United were. \n\nThe premier has always been predictable.\n\nI'm not happy with how it went in the end, but it was a cracking season in parts, and there were some fantastic games. It was the highest scoring PL ever. I think the standard in the mid table is getting really good. Let's not all get too negative\n\nEvery single one of the last 4 were gifted to City by clear and obvious officiating mistakes.\n\nEnglish people officially can not call other leagues, \"Farmers leagues\", because their league is also a one team league  no different from the Bundesliga with Bayern's dominance.\n\nAt least leagues like La Liga are somewhat unpredictable, with both Barca and Madrid having a real chance of winning the league, every season.\n\nIn England, before the season even starts, everyone and their mom knows Man City is going to win the league. There is nothing exciting about this. Predictable sports get boring real quick.\n\nIt is sort of the same thing that has happened to F1 racing, with the same driver winning every race. BORING!\n\nCompetition and unpredictability is what makes sport interesting.\n\nlmao you did not say \"la liga is unpredictable with both barca and madrid having a real chance of winning\" with a straight face, did you?\n\nWtf are you talking about? ¬†Barcelona won la Liga literally just last season. Madrid won this year. ¬†Look at the stats from recent years‚Ä¶. There hasn‚Äôt been a single team winning la liga 3 or 4 years in a row. ¬†¬†\n\nCity has been the champions 4 times in a row, with no one as a major threat for them.¬†\n\nBarcelona vs Real Madrid it‚Äôs a close rivalry even in recent years (at least when it comes to the domestic tittles)¬†\n\nBottomline, premier league it‚Äôs more predictable in that aspect than the premier league. ¬†\n\nThe numbers don‚Äôt lie.¬†\n\nThe whole thing is balls, pre 2012 or so, city were nothing. Bought the league and likely in an unfair manner. It's really tainted the whole thing.\n\nIt's one of the most (if not the most) one sided leagues in Europe nowadays.\n\nRich oil club wins Premier League year after year - who could‚Äôve predicted‚Ä¶\n\nOil money and corruption win leagues.\n\nNot more predictable than when Manchester United won 13 titles in 21 years lol. Sometimes I just wonder what the average age of this sub is, because it feels like a lot of the commentators here have no clue that historically the league was dominated in a way more one sided fashion in the past. United had 2 3peats and 2 repeats in a span of 18 years. But I don‚Äôt see anybody here complaining that the league was boring then.\n\n99% sure Man City will win the next premier league. Until Guardiola leaves they will win\n\n115 charges?\n\nKeep crying lads\n\nThe other teams should start trying harder or maybe put more focus on the prem , i mean we got chelsea and United spending even more than city recently and they only go backwards, arsenal let go of the title last year but almost won now same for Liverpool in the Seasons they got Second , its not Impossible to beat city and we see that in the Champions league\n\nI think fans should stop calling them \"oil club\" and etc. United and Chelsea also spent billions but aren't achieving anything. Yes, City have a lot of money but they spend wise and don't buy overhyped players.\n\nI wonder of some of the 100+ charges against City might mean that they will get stripped from a few of their titles or not...\n\nI'm so glad Reddit wasn't around back in the late 1990s/early 2000s, otherwise I would have had to read all this whinging except that it would have been about Man Utd, not Man City.\n\nI think the problem is that people are comparing things now to an imaginary historic PL that only exists in their heads. With only a few exceptions, there's always been a team that has dominated for periods of time. That's just how it is. Man City's time will eventually come to an end, the team that replaces them as the best in the league will eventually be loathed, and the cycle will repeat itself.\n\nPredictable leagues aren‚Äôt decided on the last match day.\n\nIf it was predicted before the season started and it came to pass, then yes, it is a predictable league. And the Premier is a predictable league.\n\nI'd argue there's 115 reasons they are favourites for next year\n\nCity has been a class apart in these recent seasons.\nEven though other teams have developed and become the best version of themselves but regrettably City has always had the upper hand.\nImagine Arsenal fans looking back reminiscing about how good they were but couldn't win the title.\nThe same goes for Liverpool fans, top club with only 9 trophies(which is commendable) under Jurgen Klopp in 9 years.\nThe point I'm tryna make is these teams would've won so much more if not for City.\nGuardiola is a cheat code.\n\nMan City is a cheat code, its not just Guardiola. Yes he is a fantastic manager but other teams cant spend that level of money. They are a class apart because of how much money they have spent on recruitment.\n\n\"BeSt LeAgUe In ThE wOrLd\"\n\nTBF, if the Man Utd board weren't so incompetent at anything other than siphoning money out of the club, they'd be the ones dominating the league like Bayern or Juventus.\n\n\"But since Man United did the same, it's fine!!!\"\n\nUnited never won 4 in a row\n\nThey also never had 115 charges against them, and were never funded by a shady royal family that routinely tortures and works to death immigrant workers.\n\nCouldn‚Äôt care less. They could win 10 in a row and it wouldn‚Äôt mean a thing. They‚Äôve cheated, end of.\n\nLance Armstrong of football.\n\nHow many of these will be vacated once the 115 charges are finally adjudicated?\n\nIt's not their dominance, it's their style of play. Chloroform on the pitch.\n\nIt's not them, it's the teams they face being too scared to play. Their games against Liverpool are generally some of the best football on display.\n\nThat‚Äôs exactly why I‚Äôm done with it. Stopped watching after the epic bottle job week when both Liverpool and Arsenal proved they weren‚Äôt good enough to challenge City and potentially never will be as long as Pep is in charge. I hate City, but I can‚Äôt ignore that they are a super team, incredibly consistent and at this point too experienced and too used to this routine. I won‚Äôt get back to watching PL next season or possibly ever because my interest has really gone below zero, as a miserable Liverpool fan who lost to them twice by a single point in 90+ points campaigns, and this season‚Äôs disasterclass, it really is hopeless at this point.\n\nWell yes they can win 5 because they cheat\n\nFarmers League\n\nEh, within a point a lot of times now. It falls in favour of one of the greatest teams ever but obviously could have been different 3/4 times now. Will it ever be? One can dream.\n\nArsenal only fight until the end because Rodri get injured, making City lose and draw some games in the beginning of the PL, if Rodri plays, City don't lose, simple as that.\n\nThat‚Äôs like saying Arsenal would‚Äôve probably won the league last year if Saliba didn‚Äôt get injured in April.\n\nSix of the last seven seasons have been won by one club, which makes the PL a one club league unfortunately.\n\nIf someone is gonna do 5 in a row I wouldn‚Äôt mind seeing it in my lifetime but only if we‚Äôre not competing for it. I wouldn‚Äôt have minded seeing a double treble either.\n\nThe real win in EPL is of capitalism par excellence\n\nHopefully Newcastle can come along and disrupt the status quo of oil rich states bankrolling the premier league.\n\nThe winner is becoming predictable for sure...but would anyone seriously say villa top 4, man utd and Chelsea having a shocker? Nah...\n\nAston villa came 4th bozo\n\nArteta really mucked up the beginning of the year refusing to start Gabriel and playing an old Partey at RB and subsequently getting injured and lost for most of the season until the very end. Tying 10-man Fulham in our third match is what ended up costing us the season.\n\nMan U fell off, Chelsea  fell off, Arsenal is runner up? Prem league definitely is t the best in the world right now, it‚Äôs a tie between la liga and premier.\n\nI will be in the camp that says the premier league definitely isn't predicable and in fact has been the most unpredictable in years. Say what you want about City's charges, they are one of the best run clubs with a legendary manager and some of the best footballers in recent memory. We've seen what money with no football structure can look like (cough Chelsea, Man U). Outside of that, we've seen one of the best liverpool teams in decades, arsenal are reaching the peak of their project, we've had different teams outside the usual top 6 reach champions league places (Newcastle/Aston Villa). The title has been decided on the last day of the season multiple times over the last 5 or so seasons. It just so happened to be city on top. As a football fan, the premier league has never been so exciting.\n\nNeed a trophy for team without ffp charges\n\nThey'll do the next 3 EPLs at least\n\nI still think it's fun to watch, and see who gets into the champions league and europa places and how chelsea and united are gonna do next year, and Liverpool will be a new coach everything is so exciting, who cares that City and Baldiola are gonna win again...\n\nDefinitely can do 5, only arsenal will push them next season. I'm so glad madrid stopped another city treble lol\n\nOfficially? It has been.\n\nThis season was predictable the same way Christopher Nolan movies are predictable after youve seen them once.\n\nThey‚Äôve made the league look like a damn joke, and at times, just not worth watching, especially with the league just letting all charges go unpunished and be swept under the rug since they‚Äôre their new cash cow.\n\nCity being where they are with these charges is a menace and hangs over the head of the league. We all know it isn‚Äôt right but they keep on winning too\n\ngunners dropped points to villa in april, city in march, and liverpool in january. win any one of those games and they win the league.\n\nDoes anyone really think that City is going to be punished? I don‚Äôt think for one minute they will get penalized at all.  \n\nToo much is at stake economically for the Premiership, FA as an institution, and the Champions League.\n\nPep went to the most talented team in the world already. With the most resources. \n\nThen he goes off and talks about net spend lol. Yeah of course the net spend is low because you already had all these assets prior to arriving. \n\nLike me inheriting millions in cars. Selling them off. And buying new ones. Claiming net spend of 0. Wow - great job by me. \n\nNot just that - since arriving he‚Äôs been given more leniency by ownership than all previous managers and they‚Äôve clearly cheated hence the 115 allegations. They don‚Äôt just arrive out of thin air. Where there is smoke, there is fire. \n\nHe did the same thing at Bayern. Inherited the most talented team at the time - which has the easiest path to acquiring talent. \n\nI‚Äôll just never consider what he‚Äôs done as impressive as Klopp, Jose or Carlo. The odds are always stacked in his favour.\n\nThe thing is, Liverpool were able to compete for all those years only because another oil club 'PSG' paid 200mn for Neymar, and Barca grossly overpaid for Coutinho. Liverpool used that money to get in Van Dijk, Allison and Fabinho over the years, and they were crucial for Liverpool in all their wins. Their attack was brought for cheap, their biggest strength (wing backs) is 1 academy graduate and 1 &lt;20mn player brought from Hull City. \n\nArsenal, even after their own stadium was rebuilt, also don't have nearly the same amount of money City have. Their attack is made up of academy players, a City reject, a Chelsea reject (though they paid a lot for him) and a cheap transfer from Brighton. They are playing as well as they are because they were able to bag Odegaard when real didn't think he'll turn into this player soon enough, and Thomas Partey was immense last season.\n\nNow City, they have 8-9 ‚Ç¨60m+ players and 4-5 ‚Ç¨40-50 players. Even for their bench, they buy top players. Only in the last two seasons they have actually started selling for any profit. They don't mind making expensive transfer mistakes (Ferran, Philips, Mendy), benching ‚Ç¨100mn players (Grealish) or losing 50mn players for free (Cancelo). Liverpool have played half the season with 4-5 untested academy players in the starting line-up. \n\nAlso in England, injury problems are worse than in the rest of Europe, as they have two cups. This is what ruins any chances English teams have of creating a European legacy like Real Madrid, as they are always more tired/injured than their opponents in knockouts. \n\nCity need to be investigated and we need to know just how they have managed to amass such an advantage in the league. Does not seem possible for clubs, however well run, to compete with machines after all.\n\nI just posted this on a comment reply but can someone actually explain my below question because I haven‚Äôt seen it answered anywhere.\n\nIs there actually any proof that all or any of the charges relate to man city‚Äôs ability to purchase players? Sure there are the charges but who has analysed them for what they mean?\n\nWe had a real chance... then Kane left.  Put the fear into squads early this season though.  \n\nA still a little very depressed over that.\n\nWith the amount of cheating they do, they can win 10 in a row easily.\n\nThey could do 115\n\nBut City cant have season like Bayern last year and still win it.  They need to be very competitive to win it in the end. Thats the difference\n\nThe only challenger in the league left is arsenal \nMaybe Tottenham and Aston villa may get stronger next season \nBut city is still miles ahead of them\n\nYep, it is predictable. \nThat's what 2.000.000.000 pounds and breaking 115 FFP rules does to a league.\n\nPlastic city need to pay the price for breaking FFP laws!!!\n\nYou can change the result of just 3 PL games in the past 7 years and it looks like this:\n\nCity x3 Titles\nLiverpool x3 titles\nArsenal x1 title\n\nSo I‚Äôm not sure your point is correct¬†\n\nWhen you‚Äôre a corrupt criminal organisation, you can buy/win anything\n\nBring in a manager who is serious and can win and he can beat pep easy , wenger n jose did with fergie btw , klopp beat pep once too . Arteta is a mid manager and won nothing for 4 years and you guys hype him up when will u realize hes average medicore\n\nPep ko jaane do, phirse unpredictable hojayegi\n\nThe PL needs to just kick them out the league and deal with getting sued by the City owners.\n\n\nIf we all got together and flipped our shit over these cheating bastards like we did over the Super League they'd be gone tomorrow.\n\nSkill issue. \n\nBut it was a bit of a dull season all round. Not many big twists and turns. \n\nGolden age was the 2010s imo. 10 years of mixed winners and results. But even then you had some predictability with the whole big6 thing.\n\nThis‚Äôll be the last go of it. Pep is on for one more season and he‚Äôs done so their run will likely be coming to an end"

It‚Äôs hilarious.\n\nThe first part seems so common, you heard the same from Messi/Cristiano etc. No wonder scouts get a nice compensation\n\nYes, I was one of those players - far better than Messi who was my contemporary but pasta and anime did me in.\n\nUsername checks out\n\nThat one uncle everyone got\n\nYou could've won more Ballon d'Or than Vini\n\nThe laugh I just laughed.\n\nsure you were buddy\n\nMfs when they realise sarcasm exists:\n\nLikewise with racing, I'm convinced that the absolute best driver in the world isn't Hamilton or Verstappen, it's some unknown dude working as a getaway driver for a cartel or gang or whatever.\n\n\nHell Ukraine/Russian drivers on the front line can probably haul ass faster than any true racing driver\n\nIsn't racing one of those sports that only the super rich can become pro at?\n\nYes, which pretty much negates OC's conviction. To be a F1 driver, you will need to have gone through a very lengthy and expensive process going through the ranks of kart racing starting from when you're a kid. If you haven't gone through that process, you will simply be a snail compared to the others. Not just that, your body won't adjust, as these guys experience a slow process of handling G forces as they get older. The driving techniques are also much different than regular car racing. In other words, it is impossible for any random dude who you may think is a great driver but does not have the education and experience, to be better than a Hamilton or Verstappen. And when they're of a certain age, it is very unlikely they can get the experience needed.\n\nI think he meant the raw driving skill if developed by the process you‚Äôre talking about. \n\nI‚Äôm a better soccer player than a buddy of mine who played casually but he was miles ahead of me in every sport we played similar amounts of and would have been a much better player than me if he‚Äôd spent time playing it. \n\nWith Raphinha, he probably means when he was a kid he wasn‚Äôt the most talented kid in his friend group and if they had all been in academies and had his drive and luck and developed as much as he did, they woulda been better. It‚Äôs likely not totally accurate, but from what I understand there are definitely Brazilian kids who never make it who woulda been all-timers but has socioeconomic conditions against them.\n\nLooking good at that age doesn't translate to being good at the professional game of football. Like for one technical ability isn't all. And for two, at that age it's very different, even U18 vs adults or even U21 vs adults, you see the huge jump. So 10 year olds or whatever, if you look good there, doesn't mean anything.\n\nyea and just having raw talent isnt enough to make you a top athlete in anyway, hard work, giving your life for the sport, forgoing fun things to focus on your career, etc is 90% of being a top athlete. If you happen to be talented too you just got 'lucky' (for lack of a better word). Like Messi and Ronaldo and its likewise the reason why not every player is as good at them...\n\nThe kiwi driver who just got a crack at f1 hasn't come from super rich background.\n\nIn addition to what others have said, **either super rich - or you need sponsors**. According to some google searches \\~ 15 - 25 million EUR is needed. And almost total devotion from whole family - all holidays and weekends are spent in racing tracks.\n\n**And those sponsors are doing goodwill** \\- either from extended family or friends, or some local tycoon.\n\nYou have to start from kart racing - which itself is not cheap, but not terribly expensive. It's a family hobby, parents need to go to competitions and work as mechanics.\n\nAnd then you have to start kart racing seriously - which can cost up to 100 kEUR year (https://yle.fi/a/3-10232354)\n\nAnd for that you can get sponsors to pay for those. No big company is going to sponsor a talented kid for kart racing - except for those in the extended family, or some local businessman willing to do some goodwill.\n\nAnd from kart racing next step (or the one after that) is formula 3. Again \"nobody\" really watches that sport, so sponsors need to be willing to dish out money just for supporting. A single season costs over 1 MEUR. You want to drive for a real team? That costs you 200-400 kEUR. Yes, driver will pay to drive.\n\nNext step formula 2 - 2,5 M / season.\n\nAnd after doing season or 4 in formula 2, maybe, just mabye you get a shot at F1.\n\nHamilton the only one that grew up relatively middle class. Father had to work 4 jobs to get him into karting school\n\nEsteban Ocon from the current Grid is another... He and his family basically lived in a Campervan whilst trying to support his F1 ambitions - Its definitely hard though.\n\nHamilton's beginnings are pretty humble but that sounds next level.\n\nI'm sure there's also many others who worked similarly hard with similar sacrifices who didn't make it.\n\nMost of the times, yes. But not necessarily. \n\nMichael Schumacher, arguably the GOAT in this sport, comes from a pretty modest background (but in Germany tbh). While he was karting in his youth, he famously once took old tires from another driver out of the trash to be able to participate in a race. Still finished it at #1 though, lol.\n\nExactly, that's my point. They're not the best drivers in the world, just the best drivers with enough money to get them there.\n\n\nThe ultimate best driver is some anonymous dude flat footing it in war/cartel zones¬†\n\nThe thing is they‚Äôre not comparable. F1 isn‚Äôt the same as being a getaway driver, just because you‚Äôre great at one doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôll be good at the other. Same applies both ways though, I wouldn‚Äôt expect Hamilton to be the best getaway driver\n\nMad how Verstappen isn't the best driver considering his dad was a top driver and he's been coached since very young. Must Jimmy Wheelspin...\n\nWait, I thought he was with all the memes and stories of how he can give his opponents like 20s penalty time and still win it\n\nI mean, how would you or anyone know? You can say they MAY be, but to say they are not, shows a bit of exaggerating ego that you know.\n\nunder pressure, under fire, it's maybe even harder.\n\nNah it‚Äôs me with my Xbox controller.\n\nRally drivers are better drivers and their racing is more practical compared to f1 where it‚Äôs a team sport because the engineers and pit crew matters a lot as well. Formula one is a very niche circle and you don‚Äôt get paid until formula 1. Without sponsors most people just won‚Äôt make it to f3 or f2. \n\nSpeaking of pure talent among the recent f1 drivers, Kimi Raikkonen is probably the most talented f1 driver I‚Äôve watched. He should have more titles but the car and team failed him.\n\nYeah messi‚Äôs brother into drugs and Ronaldo‚Äôs brother alcohol. Lucky they moved away since young to escape the bad influence.\n\nThey may have fallen into drugs and alcohol because of a perceived family preference to Messi and Ronaldo. The Messi family split up for a period of time to further his career. What does that do to a siblings psychology? He could easily see it as favouritism towards Leo, that can have a huge impact on a person leaving them feeling as though they aren't good enough.\n\nMessi has never made such a claim.\n\nExplain parts of his hunger. Beautiful to see and very inspirational\n\ninspiration\n\nLost a lot of friends TO the drug trade. IN changes the meaning completely\n\nDoes it? He had friends who were IN the world of drugs and crime, that‚Äôs kind of the point. When you‚Äôre in that kind of environment and you have to do what you need to do to survive then you‚Äôre just part of that world, not much choice involved.\n\nI always say that the best football player ever has never played the game!\n\nBut the best footballer is not only the one who plays beautifully. It is also the one who has the character to show that he is the best. I also knew a guy who played ten times better than me. But I became captain of my ninth division team through dedication and commitment, and he wasn't interested in that: he became a fitter.\n\nYou can see this from the way he plays with so much drive and commitment.\n\nThat's pretty brutal, what an upbringing that must have been...\n\nIs he not Thiagos brother and their father was a professional footballer??\n\nNo\n\nsad\n\nUnfortunately he didn‚Äôt graduate from college so no ballon d‚Äôor for your Raphi!\n\nStill crying over a non injustice I see.\n\nHow is he crying?\n\n[deleted]\n\nLol anti English racism. Funny\n\nBellingham went from 18th in the ballon d'or list to third so that's a huge step up\n\n[deleted]\n\nThat's not very long.\n\n[deleted]\n\nI'm playing since 1993, are you surrounded by teenagers in your life? What a weird stance, lol\n\nMajority of football fans is watching since the 80s or 70s, bro"

We just have to wait and see how it goes.\n\nWe'll just have to see if madrid can find the correct manager who can bring a team of superstars to cooperate.\n\nLike that guy who coached Madrid though la decima or Milan in 2003...\n\nOh wait\n\nYeah i heard that guy is supposed to be pretty good...\n\nJokes aside. Even he was fired from Real in 2015 when they went trophyless, so you never know.\n\nAncelotti once said \"*everybody gets fired at some point, it happened to all of us. Except Pep.*\"\n\nAnd Sir Alex\n\nAlex Ferguson was sacked by St Mirren, part of the reason he was so driven to succeed at Aberdeen\n\nwhen i was little i thought that when a manager gets sacked the team would line up and punch the manager in the balls‚Ä¶..\n\nThat‚Äôs wild\n\n[deleted]\n\ni was so sure the real madrid team did it to Rafa Benitez when he got sacked and cr7 really enjoyed it and did it 3 times\n\nWell, he was even in a worst position that Ancelotti has ever been so his case, as well as Klopp‚Äôs are narrow misses\n\nAnd Klopp!\n\nAnd me!\n\nAnd my axe!\n\nI get your point but the 2015 case was a reactionary impulse that eventually brought success to the club but if you look at the season, it wasn't a bad one by any means.\n\n\n2nd in la liga (by 2 points) and ucl semi final. Also, every player expected to have Carlo as a manager the year after, that kinda proves how good he was.\n\n\nI mean, carlo is carlo\n\nIt's an unwritten rule for Madrid to sack managers after they don't deliver any trophies during a season. Overall, 2014/15 Madrid was one of the best teams I've ever seen. RM didn't win anything for these reasons:\n\n1. Injuries. Modric missed large parts of the season, same for Khedira. Carvajal and Bale also missed many games.\n2. No DM. Xabi Alonso left, Khedira was injured, Illaramenti was shit. Ramos had to play as a DM in a UCL semi-final against Juventus. It's evident that the midfield of Kroos-Modric-James was amazing against most La Liga teams, but against good teams it didn't work as well. RM faced Atletico 8 times during that season and one only once, including losing 4-0 to them. \n3. Barcelona were simply TOO good. Atletico were amazing as well. Peak La Liga.\n\nYeah they were very very good.\nBut the same season was the best Neymar and best Barcelona Suarez.\n\nWe can allways get back that algerian frenchy who won 4 Champions leagues\n\nHe won 3 - unless you either count la decima (he was an assistant) or 2002 where he won as a player\n\nOr 2022 when he won as a fan\n\nWould be funny if it is just a repeat of the early 2000's where they didn't won a lot\n\nExactly\n\nThose peak Galactico years where they won a super cup and one league title from 2003/4 to 2006/7.\n\nWas always wild how unsuccessful that period was.\n\nWild how missing a WC DM does to a team. The team lacked balance.\n\nIt‚Äôs not really the same. Vino, Rodrygo, Militao, Tchuameni, Camvinga weren‚Äôt stars. Madrid had to help with their development.\n\nSubscribe\n\nWould love it\n\nAlso what people conveniently like to overlook is that every team Real played against in knockouts competed with them. Red Bull game was very very close. And Man City dominated Real and Dortmund killed them in first half. This team isn‚Äôt one that kills every opponent 5-0. Maybe with Mbappe it‚Äôll be different but finding the right balance will be difficult and losing Kroos will be felt especially playing against low block teams\n\nThis is a Real Madrid team was in transition - lost Benzema before the season, I think most Madridista feel we over performed.\n\nMbappe brings what was missing a goal getter. We relied too much on counter and playing tough defense. \n\nMbappe marks the end of our transition\n\nWho replaces Kroos though?  And I think the back 4 may need some improvement but not so much\n\nThere is no direct replacement of Kroos but adapting to the strengths of the current squad which is more energetic, athletic and younger.\n\nIts the adaptation which is the key- Camavinga, Rodrygo, Guler, Brahim Diaz and Endrick will allow Carlo the chance to play almost variation a depending on opposition will playing strength to strength.\n\nThe lack of a 9 by default gave Rodrygo a starting spot.\n\nYes backline which was incredible last season needs attention to avoid the mass injuries we had this season\n\nThe first leg against City, Madrid was superior. They could have ended scoring 5, but they were really sloppy.\n\ni think this logic made sense for PSG because of neymar/messi/mbappe being there and them not yet proving whether they could win a champions league. Madrid just won their CL and are adding mbappe to that. I‚Äôm not worried that they‚Äôll be able to play together considering the depth on that team already\n\nThe sum of the parts may not constitute a better whole .. some massive egos to have to manage\n\nThey were dominated for 60 mins by Dortmund and were almost beaten had Dortmund taken their chances\n\nReal have that anime protagonist energy when it comes to CL though. There‚Äôs Real Madrid. And Champion‚Äôs League Real Madrid\n\nIt happens too much to be a coincidence, I‚Äôm sure that this is Real‚Äôs game plan\n\nYeah they planned to direct shots on the post!\n\nFullkrugs shot was offside\n\nForgot to mention they planned this as well ..\n\nI mean he got the chance to shoot partially because of the offside. Thats why there is a offside rule\n\nThe thing is, they didn't, Bayern didn't, and City didn't. \n\nThey are absolutely massive at the moment and it seems to be their gameplan, to tire out opponents for 3/4 of the game, and after that (or before) pounce on a counterattack or do some magic at the top of the pitch.\n\n'Tire out'. Conceding massive chances is tiring teams out now?\n\nIf they don't succeed, yeah.\n\nAnd then they lost. I was never worried\n\nYou think they‚Äôll struggle?\n\nI do (idk how alone I am with that) but it‚Äôll be infighting (Mbappe wants to be a winger‚Ä¶.so is rodrygo or Vini gonna leave?) and too much attack will cause a fall out (if they add Davies, then Tchoumeni RB CB CB. And very little rest for the lot)\n\nThink 2010‚Äôs real before casemiro\n\nRonaldinho needs to put on his jersey again\n\nMadrid can have all the stars in the world but Ronaldinho proved to us that that dont matter as long as your a bigger star than all of them\n\n(which is a problem as there is none in club football rn that can singlehandedly carry xD)\n\nFor the one millionth time. Football isn‚Äôt played on paper. \nEven la liga isn‚Äôt a guarantee, there‚Äôs a reason the games are played and not just decide who‚Äôs best and give them the trophy\n\nThis. I remember same headlines when Real entered galactico era, or after their 2009 transfer window or when PSG had Messi, Neymar and Mbappe. Or look at City team that is actually a machine but still struggle to win CL more than once. Madrid might be best on paper but I'm sure they will struggle sooner or later\n\nlol after the 2009 transfer window they won 5 UCLs in a decade including a 3 peat. The difference is shitty teams adding good players to not be shitty v a top team adding a top player to round it all out.\n\nThis. I mean, I know Barca were complete rubbish this year, but they did win La Liga by 10 points just last season.\n\nIf barca would have won the classicos they would have won the league and those were close games.\n\nIf my grandmother had wheels, she'd be a bike.\n\nSpot on hahaha\n\nIf Barca won the Clasicos Real would put more effort into their last games where the league was already decided, like against Villarreal or Betis.\n\nThey weren't rubbish they were actually pretty decent they just got unlucky in the group of death if they had survived inter they could've easily made it to the final they were the 3rd best team that year being beaten by the Fifth best team basically\n\n‚ÄúAny person (or team) can beat any person (or team) on a good day.‚Äù We saw it when Real Madrid were heavy underdogs on their 2022 run. (Although now, can Real Madrid be considered underdogs at all in UCL? lol) We see it when national teams like Costa Rica make to the Quarter Finals of the World Cup.\n\nDid you not watch Perez‚Äôs previous galactico team‚Ä¶\n\nThere‚Äôs no guarantees.\n\nNot even close to the same. Core of the team came younger and is becoming world class in Madrid and have yet to enter their physical prime, instead of being bought afterwards and relatively older.\n\nBut still the headline is dumb. Neither of the last 2 champions league were won on a dominant way, and Mbappe will not change that.\n\nExactly, it's funny how people really forgot what was Galactico about. This is almost opposite to that. Like, Mbappe is only \"galactico\" signing since Hazard and before that Bale.\n\nHow is Bellingham not?\n\nBellingham was 19y old kid with 3 season playing for Dortmund...\n\nI mean Bellingham won Bundesliga player of the season before joining real madrid.\n\nAny Bundesliga viewer would say that other players deserved it a lot more\n\nBellingham didn't have 10% of the status Zidane, Ronaldo, Beckham, and Figo had.\n\n\nHe was an extremely promising midfielder before joining, but only became a star at Real Madrid.\n\nWhile I agree he doesn't have the same star power as the original galacticos prior to joining he was more than just a \"promising midfielder\" lol he literally won bundesliga player of the season before joining real madrid.\n\nYeah for real lol, they didn't pay 100+ million just for a \"promising midfielder\"\n\nWow‚Ä¶.it‚Äôs almost like you haven‚Äôt set foot near England. He was seen as the best midfielder in the world last summer, remember how many clubs were throwing bids in?\n\nBellingham wasn‚Äôt an elite player for years and didn‚Äôt have some of the best seasons of the 21st century. Bellingham is closer to Tchouameni than Bale and Hazard\n\nHe had a good enough season to be voted player of the year in the bundesliga, was young yes but who even are the previous Galacticos? Obviously Zidane, Beckham, Ronaldo, Figo, but weren't there some lesser known players and ones who came for very little who are still considered Galacticos?\n\nHazard, Bale, Cristiano, Kaka are the last 4 galactico signing. A galactico isn‚Äôt just a great player, it encompasses many notions\n\n1. Great player\n\n2. Big money\n\n3. Exciting playstyle \n\n4. Legendary before coming to Madrid\n\nLesser known galacticos don‚Äôt exist that‚Äôs the entire purpose of the notion. \n\nThere‚Äôs a story of a scout trying to get Florentino to buy Kaka when he was still a young prospect, the scout told Perez that he was going to be a ballon d‚Äôor winner and Perez replied to call him back once Kaka got a ballon d‚Äôor. \n\nMbapp√© is the only galactico signing in this Real Madrid squad\n\nLittle known Players Like Roberto Carlos, Cannavaro, Raul and Casillas. Roberto Carlos and Cannavaro were  both around 6 Million at the time, Raul and Casillas were Academy Players. \n\nThere were also Robinho and Michael Owen who came in as galacticos, Robinho maybe less so, but their Status has since been debatable. \n\nClaude Makelele also comes to mind. \n\nBut Perez never really liked paying much for Defensive Players, Not really considering them galacticos, which resulted in Makelele leaving and a Transfer of Patrick Viera failing, who nowadays would undoubtedly have been considered a galactico. \n\nOwen was a Balon Dor Winner, Same with Cannavaro. Casillas became goalkeeper of the year every year for almost a decade and Roberto Carlos is considered the best Leftback of all time. And they dont even come to mind immediately when thinking about that era. Thats how stacked Real Madrid was.\n\nWhich makes it even more impressive that Real Madrid seem to be on a similar trajectory of having a Team of Balon Dor nominees and candidates, with Most Players reaching their peak world class Level only after joining the Club.\n\nI remember the galactico period. This js different, RM have an established team and are adding Mbappe. The galacticos were a mishmash of massive names, rather than a cohesive team.\n\nExactly. Galactico was heavily criticised. Barcas run was based on being a team.\n\n100%. I'll add to your first point that this team can actually defend, unlike the Galacticos. And they can hurt opponents (Mbapp√© adds to this) in the counter, again, unlike the Galacticos.\n\nAnd yet, your second point applies as well. People act like Madrid won 4 consecutive UCLs and 5 LaLiga titles. It's 2 UCLs in 6 years. The first one took a miraculous run to the final, where then the MOTM was Courtois. This one wasn't as miraculous, but there was still some luck (penalties are always a toss up) and miracles (Joselu) involved.\n\nAlso, Perez compromised key structural players such as Makelele for star power. He seems to have learnt his lesson as I'm 100% sure he wouldn't sell a Jude/Fede for a star now and prioritised on building that part of the team.\n\nedit: not that Jude/Fede aren't stars but you get the point.\n\nHow are any of them stars before they were bought? All came as prospects... The only players they bought for big money were Tchouameni and Bellingham and we don't talk about Harzard... or Jovic üòï\n\nTbf they did win two leagues and a CL in their first three years\n\nActually yes. Did you watch the previous galactico team?\n\nThat team was highly unbalanced and made some bad decisions in taking managers. The players were also like mercenaries.\n\nThis one is quite different. Most of them were gotten young and is achieving peak and stardom here (bar Mbappe). The positions are wonderfully filled and they have the best manager who can control a squad like this while making everyone happy.\n\nThe last galactico team won their last 3 CL and 4 out of the last 5. But yeah, the first one wasnt as succesfull.\n\ni was wondering this for a while. right now it seems only madrid and city can compete with each other in the champions league besides some suprises. this isn‚Äôt good for football.\n\nthere‚Äôs also been a fall in the quality of other clubs too though. Chelsea, Man U, Barcelona, Juventus, Liverpool and maybe even Bayern.\n\nNot at all. Bayern went toe to toe with Madrid even when Bayern is considered weak right now.\n\nEveryone real faced went toe to toe with them, until they didnt. Real wont win big, they play as well as they need to win\n\nYou talked like Real is some machine. They lost the league title to Barcelona just one season ago.\n\nMaybe they weren‚Äôt, but they‚Äôre about to be\n\nOr maybe this is the start of fractions between Vini and Mbappe\n\nlol cope\n\nAlso borussia was close\n\nAlso Leipzig\n\nThe Champions league is dead.\nWe pretend it's fun but the potential champions shrink each year\n\nIt might sound stupid but I really hope my team ( Feyenoord Rotterdam) draws Real Madrid in CL next year. I am fascinated to see how we would do. \n\nThen again, I was overjoyed we got Man City one year and were slaughtered 0-4.\n\nLiverpool made 3 CL finals, only Madrid have been better than them in Europe in recent years. City have finally become European heavy weights.¬†\n\n\nCourtois won them a CL tbf, best gk performance in a CL final, compare that to Karius üò≠\n\nDortmund just played the final game vs Real Madrid and played the way better football.\n\nFor the first half\n\nAbsolutely, if life teaches you anything it's that the things you expect to happen never usually do!\n\nPhew, how tiring :) \n\n\n\nI've heard this a thousand times. Madrid when they signed Ronaldo, Madrid when they signed Zidane, Madrid when they signed Beckham, PSG when they signed Neymar, PSG when they signed Messi, City when they signed Haaland.\n\n\n\nNone of them won it all.\n\n\n\nHere's a fact: madrid has Modric-Camavinga-Tchouameni-Ceballos-Valverde-¬øBellingham? for 3 midfield positions and will play more than seventy games this season.\n\n\n\nThe most important player in the Madrid of the galacticos was Makelele, who left, and they went down.\n\n\n\nCarlo has a lot of work to do in balancing the team, he has solutions, they are not easy.\n\nI don't think they're that strong. They are able to dig deep and  find momentum where it counts but not an unstoppable team by any means\n\nBack in 2002, RM were already christened the ‚ÄúGalacticos‚Äù, by the press. After winning their first Champions league/European Cup trophy in 32 years as an outsider(1998), and the same trophy again in 2000, they embarked on an effort to strengthen their team with as many offensive super stars as possible. That led them in acquiring Luis Figo (Ballon d‚Äôor 2000 winner) that summer and Zidane (ballon d‚Äôor 1998 winner) in 2001. Initially this strategy was successful since they won the 2002 champions league, meaning that after a 32 year drought they had now won 3 titles in 5 years. The future looked bright as it was. \n\nAnd then they dropped the bomb. Ronaldo (the OG one, R9) the most feared striker in the world, was joining them fresh from his 2002 World Cup victory with Brazil (where he was the top scorer of the tournament). He went on to win the ballon d‚Äôor too that same year. \n\nThe whole European continent was terrified. How could anyone stop this team? How could anyone stand any chance? And indeed at first it seemed that way, as they cruised to a European super cup win over Feyenoord. ‚ÄúA veil of fear had covered football Europe‚Äù they were saying. But soon issues started to surface. Real Madrid was already full of offensive talent and Ronaldo was playing excellently, but it seemed the team had hit diminishing returns. There were already two world class strikers in their roster (Raul and morientes) and the team just didn‚Äôt produce the goods on the main (CL stage). They began the season slowly, getting two draws against AEK in group stage 1 and they even finished second in group stage 2, eventually getting eliminated in the semis by Juventus. \nUnfazed, RM continued the same strategy in the following years by adding players like Owen or Beckham but the results just weren‚Äôt there in the CL. They abandoned this tactic few years later and took them 12 years to win the CL again.\n\nThe moral of the story is that these kinds of transfers can be a blessing and a curse. Mbappe‚Äôs best position is LW, where RM already has the second best player in the world for that position (Vini Jr), so he will be forced to play as a striker. Granted, this time round they don‚Äôt have a world class striker to bench in favor of mbappe and the most likely outcome is that he will massively improve the team but this isn‚Äôt a given. And frankly, right now RM isn‚Äôt far and away the best team in the continent, as the match up with Man City showed. Perhaps mbappe won‚Äôt be as disruptive as we fear and CL will see competition  next year.\n\nKey difference: Real now have a younger and more balanced squad. They're set to be good for years. Whatever Carlo does, it's not exactly dominating the opposition. But he'll be gone by the time many of these players reach their peak, and could be replaced by a manager that won't be happy with the team playing like they did against City.  \n\nAnd, there won't be another City. Whether or not the 115 charges hit them, Pep's probably leaving next summer and City will take a nosedive. At which point everyone else will be clear underdogs to Madrid.\n\nWhy does everyone assume City will ‚Äúnosedive‚Äù? Pep leaving is big, I agree, but City have the players and personnel in place to continue dominating. It‚Äôs stupid to believe that Madrid will just walk untouched to the CL and La Liga titles every year.\n\nIt's not like they outplayed all their opponents this season, even less so in the UCL. Still had to go super defensive against City, and if DVB took one or two of their chances in the first half, then it's a completely different game. \n\nMbappe makes them stronger but not unplayable. Kross will be a big loss and probably why they kept Modric for another year, which means they'll definitely need to buy a playmaker soon (Bellingham is more lampard than he is De Bruyne). Get a Debruyne and a proper striker and they'll be unplayable\n\nPersonally I‚Äôd be completely fine if the team imploded\n\nIf any manager can manage those egos , then yes , they can be super good but let‚Äôs wait and see\n\nMan city can still fuck with us\n\nOnly Man City.\n\nIndeed, Man City dominated Real over two legs and only went out on pens.\n\nThey wont win next CL, mark my words!\n\nThe state run teams can\n\nNobody should've been able to compete with a team that had him, Messi, and Neymar in it either. That sure turned out great\n\nMessi and Neymar weren‚Äôt in their primes when Messi joined PSG\n\nMessi &amp; Neymar went for a paydayüòÇüòÇ\n\nMbappe was also an entitled rat at PSG, he needs to leave that attitude in France.\n\nCan he play with Vini though as they like to occupy the same space. Remember Coutinho was great for Liverpool but clashed positionally at Barca\n\nThis version of the galactico is far more defensively sound than the previous one. But will their attack click? Only time will tell.\n\nThey'll still have 30%possession vs city and need a miracle to beat them\n\nThey'll get eliminated in the next CL group stage, it's scripted.\n\nMbappe will mess up the cohesiveness of this group. We can expect a Madrid downfall\n\nI still need to see if it will work out. It could very well be, there will be a clash of egos. With Vini, Rodrygo and Endrick, there will be a big Brazilian block and not sure if Mbappe will be able to handle that ego wise\n\nOne issue. Mbappe needs Real Madrid more than Real Madrid needs him. Kylian lacks Champions League in his trophy case and Real is as close to a guaranteed win as possible. Therefore until he wins it I expect to be fully obedient and compliant with the locker room. When they get it, this is when it may get tougher but that's still one season of Real Madrid annihilating everyone in their way\n\nReal Madrid will have a worse season next year with Mbappe than they just did without him.\n\nThat's peak coping at this point.\n\nFootball is still a team game‚Ä¶.\n\nWhat kind of question is that? Just a few days ago you propably saw the Dortmund game. Mbappe arrival won't change them defensively\n\nI'm still curious. Is Mbappe going to defend like vinicius, rodrygo and Bellingham? Is vinicius going to defend if Mbappe doesn't? \n\nI think Ancelotti will get it on track for a season but I'm.not sure if every trainer can.\n\nA lot of key real players are leaving/almost leaving. Age will start to play a key role now too.\n\nKroos just left.\n\nModric is is about to turn 39! Ridiculous haha\n\nCarvajal is 32\n\nRudiger is 31\n\nNacho is 34\n\nCourtois is 32\n\nWe‚Äôre about to see an entirely new midfield. Let‚Äôs see if it works out.\n\nNahh nobody is beating this team if they they decide to play as a team.\n\nRemember when people thought Neymar - Mbappe - Messi was gonna be unbeatable? Look where they ended up.\n\nNo one can stop RM from winning liga as long as Barcelona are in financial trouble.\n\nNo English team can stop Madrid in UCL as long as Perez has the authority to move around matches in la liga to help out his team and English teams playing an ungodly amount of games. \nIt's truly over.\n\n\"and even the French prime minister, Emmanuel Macron.\"\n\nCan always count on espn for quality journalism.\n\nTransfers don't win you trophies. A team has to make adjustments to the difficulties they face during the season and still perform well while the players get along well in the dressing room.\n\nUnpopular opinion: Mbappe will only bring instability to currently stable Real Madrid squad, they will perform worse next season.\n\n  \nNow you can crucify me\n\nIf Messi, Neymar and Mbappe didnt guarantee a CL, the answer is simple¬†\n\nWhere will the entitled brat play? In the same position that the other entitled brat Vini plays? I can‚Äôt see it, but if anyone can handle those divas, Ancelloti can.\n\nWe need to see how Don Carlo handles the massive egos\n\nStill gonna park the bus at etihad stadium\n\nYes, of course others can and will compete. There are so many factors involved that signing one player, even one of Mbapp√©‚Äôs calibre, doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean much.\n\nIf you remember Galacticos and its massive failure and how Mbapp√© failed in PSG as well‚Ä¶ nothing is guaranteed.\n\n&gt;If you remember Galacticos and its massive failure \n\nThey actually won a CL though unlike PSG with Messi Neymar Mbappe ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\n\n&gt;and how Mbapp√© failed in PSG as well‚Ä¶\n\nThe only thing Mbappe failed to do at PSG was to leave sooner. PSG without Mbappe struggled every game\n\nThis is such an American centric way to look at things. Comparing stats and player values etc. Football is big as it is because there is constant upsets, the little man sometimes punches hard and creates legends etc. \n\nNo matter how hard you try and formulate the game (City etc), someone will come knocking you down. \n\nSo no, there‚Äôs no guarantee that Madrid will even win the league. It‚Äôs always a battle and it‚Äôs always enjoyable.\n\nThe football writers will come up with something to redress the balance, like Mbappe going full Hazard or something.\n\nThe funny thing is that Mbappe and Vinicius thrive in the same role. But, if you have a manager like Carlo, then these things aren't an issue. He will find a solution.\n\nThis is so stupid, it never works this way. Look at prime Barca or Man City now\n\nDortmund looked pretty good against both of them.\n\nI do think there are SOME question marks about him and Vini Jr working together, specifically occupying the same spaces.\n\nyeah but Toni Kroos is out, Real has lost its brain. It is more interesting if Real second line will be capable enough to feed Kylian with passes.\n\nI am intrigued if they can make mbappe and vini work to their full potential together, they have a lot of similarities in play and positionally liking to be on the left.\n\nIf they can then it‚Äôs over for next season because the talent is just mind blowing in that team\n\nThey can't do much better...\n\nPSG had Neymar, Mbappe and Messi in the same team and nothing.\n\nWe'll just wait and see how the team gels together and performs\n\nLets just let Barca's YA grow a little...\n\nLast time a Galaticos team was built, Barcelona revealed the GOAT.\n\nPeople said the same thing about MC last season. This is football. No one can say for sure what will happen.\n\nRonaldo joined Madrid almost 15 yrs ago, they didn‚Äôt immediately win trophies (in fact, they had a drought). This is football, not basketball, the field is too large for two or three players to make a difference.\n\nIf mbappe leaves his shit attitude and entitlement at PSG, he can do well. He still is not that great of a no.9. I would take 2 other no.9 over him, maybe 3.\n\nYes teams can. Dortmund more than competed. Liverpool battered them a couple of years back and city were superior in the quarter final this year. Mbappe there is a frightening prospect though\n\nSo, seeing Mbappe in the English Premiere League is going to remain a dream. Doesn't Real Madrid have enough UCL already? Anyways, he deserves to win the Champions League and it is now going to happen multiple times for him. Happy for him!\n\ncan't wait til he's ours in 5 years\n\nMadrid had in the 00ers years a almost Superstar Team only Zidane,Figo,Ronaldo, Raul just to name few and they won barely anything. I dont know  if Madrid needs Mbappe really. Vino Jr is currently anyways better than him.\n\nOnly Pep can beat Real Madrid\n\nI can think of 115 reasons some teams will still be able to compete\n\nThey‚Äôll win the league again even if they don‚Äôt play well. It‚Äôs the Champions League where the other teams may have a chance.\n\nIt‚Äôs past ridiculous now\n\nGreat next season.\n\nArteta has to win or his whole project is a failure. Slot has to replace klopp and at minimum challenge for PL/CL till the last weeks. For city not winning CL or PL is a titanic failure. Kompany to prove if he is worth being in a big club.\n\nNew coach for barca, that has the obligation to win the league because real won 3 of the last 4\n\nOn paper, one of the strongest teams in Europe. But I guess Man city can compete with this team well!\n\nIt‚Äôs not like Real Madrid blew teams off the park this year. They could easily have lost against City, Bayern and Dortmund. Mbappe wont make them unbeatable.\n\nI liked how this nonsense keeps getting brought up when the first set of Real Madrid Galacticos, a team full of superstars, are seen as underachievers.\n\nFootball is dead\n\nI want this real madrid reign to end. Its killing the sport\n\nTil Bayern beats them like they‚Äôre supposed to\n\nEnter Copa Del Rey\n\nChampions league feels like a done deal for a few years now.\n\nIf the dressing room can fit the ego of both Vini and Mbappe I‚Äôll be amazed. But if they gel it will be scary for everyone.\n\nReal get battered by multiple teams every season but get incredibly lucky so yes other teams can compete.\n\nThey got a player that (likely) betters one of their strengths. Of course that makes them more dangerous, but it‚Äôs not like they‚Äôre going from having no attack to immediately having one of the best in the world.\n\nI honestly think that the expectations are going to be too high for them next season, and people are going to be stunned when they only pick up one trophy\n\nWonder how mbappe and vini are together.. since both are pretty punchable types.. maybe they hate each other and the dressingroom takes sides and unrest follows.\n\nkevin durant joining the warriors type beat\n\nMbappe was in a team that had a ballon dor winning messi and he failed to get to a quarter final in two consecutive years football is not fifa it's full of surprises so yes.\n\nMan City is still the better club in my opinion.\n\nI still think Man City has a better squad and coach. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs an instant win for real. We‚Äôve seen how Mbappe takes over a team, will he be a team player?\n\nSoon Hakimi will join him.\n\nI can definitely see a scenario wheee they lose the champions league because of him. Not specifically him but if they can‚Äôt figure a way out to make the team work then no champions league\n\nIt was only a matter of time\n\nDon Carlo is the real menace tbh\n\nsigning mbappe is the worst decision ever made by madrid how could they add him in their winning squad??\n\nReal Madrid can win champions league without Mbappe‚Ä¶.psg definitely didn‚Äôt win champion league with Mbappe‚Ä¶..psg now pass the diva to Real Madrid.\n\nFootball is f up. The money is rotting it to the core, and there is little integrity left. \n\nWith everything so currupt and money oriented, I simply do not believe anymore that the refs and all are not equally currupt. \n\nThe glitzy show is already not much better the Wrestling in the USA, a staged show with athletic actors.\n\ncan't wait to low diff them\n\nYes because he sucks.\n\nShort answer no. Long answer no fucking way\n\nAs a supporter of Real, I have a very bad feeling about this move."

    "all_comment_text": "Blows my mind that after winning an international football tournament for your country - which you‚Äôre clearly proud of - you choose to spend time singing racist songs about a country on a separate continent.\n\n[deleted]\n\nI wouldn't even think of France as being a big rival of Argentina. Was the loss in 2018 that bad? Maybe they should have it out for Germany who beat them in 2006, 2010 and 2014 but it might be a little awkward given how some of them may have had grandparents who came over from Germany in the mid-40s.\n\nIt has roots in the Mbapp√©-Messi rivalry at PSG.\n\nWe know from insiders that it was very tense between frenchmen and south americans back then, and there‚Äôs probably a lot of things we don‚Äôt know in their relation\n\nthere was a comment from Mbappe saying first that futbol in Latam wasn't as good as in Europe, then saying that the Eurocopa was more important than the WorldCup. I suspect that this is more related than anything else\n\nNo man, this is just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nThis declaration by Mbapp√© follows problems between him and the south american \"clan\" of PSG including Neymar and Messi, that we don‚Äôt know everything about.\n\nSo a person talking about skill difference makes it ok to bash his race. You just proved why many Argentines are  racist lol\n\nNo one is saying it‚Äôs ok, it‚Äôs about trying to understand the thought processes that would make a bunch of otherwise fairly sensible, media trained players film themselves singing such a racist song.\n\nThe fans hear about the rivalry, dial it up to 11 because that‚Äôs what fans always do, someone comes up with a song, the fans adopt it and sing it for 2 years straight at every game/event. As  the players hear it all the time until they stop being shocked by the lyrics, stop attaching meaning to the lyrics and it becomes so normalised they don‚Äôt see what‚Äôs wrong with it - to the point that they‚Äôre comfortable posting it online. \n\nThat doesn‚Äôt make it acceptable, and no one has said it is.\n\nNah it‚Äôs not that easy. \n\nThe old dark winds are rising, my friend, and Argentina hasn‚Äôt been a harbour for many Nazis ‚Äî notoriously: Eichmann ‚Äî by coincidence. \n\nArgentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, Chile have seldom had a dark skinned player come through, if any, at national level, and white skin is much more common than in other latin countries.\n\nAgain the only logical reason a person would be comfortable recording a racist song is because it‚Äôs normalized in their culture or family.\n\nYou obviously don‚Äôt have any context on this subjects not being Hispanic or from south America ; being that I am one and I have seen thousands of instances of this from Argentine and Uruguayans. I think I have a little bit more context than random Reddit  user . But I totally understand your logic though. I‚Äôm\nJust done with arrogant Argentines and Hispanic culture at large repeatedly excusing their racist behavior  as a joke. \n\nDo some research or the history of black Argentines/Uruguayans. You‚Äôll see where I‚Äôm coming from\n\nIf you're \"Hispanic\", where are you actually from then?\n\n&gt; in their culture\n\nWhoa, that's reaching a bit much isn't it?\n\n&gt; I‚Äôm Just done with arrogant Argentines and Hispanic culture at large repeatedly excusing their racist behavior as a joke.\n\nWell, that is the problem, because we do actually consider it a joke, we don't give a damn about racism here, not only is frustrating to see people from other countries say that we are racists when our population is 99% made from immigrants and their descendants but...\n\n&gt; Do some research or the history of black Argentines/Uruguayans\n\nThe fact that some people believe some wild shit about black people that lived here some 150 years ago and, even worse, that somehow still believe is an issue in the modern era (come on man we made slavery illegal BEFORE the us or britain did)\n\nBernardino Rivadavia, one of our \"founding fathers\" and the very 1st president of Argentina was of African descent.\n\nWe don't have a significant Black population due to intermixing, by the time our country became independent, intermixing with the native population by the Spanish (whose children were called Mestizos) was something in the making for centuries before, it was a given that the very same thing would've happened with the black population, and it was specially pronounced when the European immigration started.\n\nWrong\n\nI think this kind of animosity between nations has always been there - it probably doesn‚Äôt even have any roots in football - it‚Äôs just that now, in the age of social media and the use of social media by sportsmen it‚Äôs coming to light.\n\nThese people are great at football - literally the top 0.0000001% but they‚Äôre sooo stupid it‚Äôs unreal\n\nYou win üèÜ the internet sir well done . Top drawer ! Lmao\n\nI think it has to do with Mbappe's remarks about South American football. First he said that European nations have superior skills to South American football. That ended up pissing off South Americas. When Argentina won he pivoted to saying the Euro is tougher than the World Cup because European nations are superior opponents. Again, a dig at the other inferior nations. \n\nSo I think they are calling out the \"non-european\" players for being snobs. As if to say \"You aren't even European to begin with, and you look down at us?\"\n\nAll childish, but I hear this nonsense all the time on these forums. I can't remember how many times someone would post how the Euros are so much better than the Copa America... I mean this Euro was particularly boring this time around, so what gives? And the same goes for the USA and Canada constantly speaking about how inferior South American / latin football is (dirty, cheating, unsportsmanlike, corrupt, rigged) trying to compare it to the pristine European football (as if they don't have blemishes). \n\nThere are racial tones and elitist statements flying back and forth and neither sounds convincing or appropriate.\n\nThey just did not like to lose against a mainly Black team. France has a fucking penthouse in their heads since then.\n\nIt stems mostly from the final in Qatar which was an intense match that came down to penalties. Regardless, the Argentinians were at the heart of a lot of controversy during that world cup, with a bunch of dubious referee decisions in their favour (particularly during the game against against the Netherlands), and the overall attitude of the squad thereafter.\n\nMost Germans arrived in Argentina long before that. There are also a lot of Argentines with French ancestry.\n\nThat really suprised me.  Why start singing this right now???  smh\n\nThey‚Äôre not spending time thinking about France. The 30 second stupid song is banter. Just a bunch of drunk players singing . They probably sang 50 songs\n\n[deleted]\n\nIt's a catchy song tbh\n\nCompletely agree that those that did that are braindead but I think it might have to do with with the FIFA ranking where Argentina are on one and France on two and that‚Äôs how they picked them over, say, England, the Netherlands or even Spain.\n\nIt was a ready made song from the WC so they just sang all they knew. And singing and dancing is a common way of celebrating.\n\nWho did they play in the WC final?¬†\n\nIt's absolutely mental that this is happening\n\nnot at all, it's been happening in argentinian teams a long time, racistas.\n\nEveryone's focusing only on Enzo, let's not forget everyone else in that video\n\nA lot of the bigger names like Messi, MacAllister etc, flew back with tier families and some coaching staff so hard to say who exactly is even on the bus as its pretty hard to make out.\n\nWho else can we actually identify in the video though? The only version of the video I‚Äôve seen is too blurry\n\nProbably no one, otherwise we would've already heard about it.\n\nIt's a bus with mic quality of an Instagram Live. Could be 3, could be 4 or the whole bus chanting. I think u can see Lo Celso (?) sleeping mouth open during another chant in the video.\n\nYup. We can't really identify anyone beyond a \"maybe\", at least so far.\n\nWhich is why Enzo alone is taking all the (well deserved) heat.\n\n90% of Argentinian sing that song....I would be amazed if a player didn't sing it.\n\nThe main issue is he was on live and is in a club with plenty of black players\n\nThe main issue is that it's a racist song, whether he's in a club with black players or not. It's not any better to sing a song like that if he isn't.\n\nI saw Tagliafico and Rodriguez.\n\nTagliafico who.. plays in France and has a black feench Captain and like a dozen black french teammates lol\n\nI hate the way articles are written. They note that offensive things were said but don‚Äôt actually quote what was said. I can‚Äôt really pass judgment on the situation because the article doesn‚Äôt actually say anything.\n\nParaphrasing but things like ‚Äúyour mother is from Angola and your father is from Ghana.‚Äù¬†\n\nWhich, no pun intended, pot calling kettle black. Virtually their entire roster is semi-recent European immigrants. Just an odd quip given their own context.\n\nSaying that black people can't really be French, Spanish, English or whatever is 1000% racist. Nobody sings about Griezmann's Portuguese granddad.\n\nOk I‚Äôll start: Griezman gramps loved bacalaaaau üé∂üé∂ au au au\n\nContext plays an important factor here.\nI'll give it a shot, but feel free to downvote away...\n\nThe song is typical of the Argentine chants. They're intended as a diss to their rival.   Like Boca fans call River fans \"Gallenas\" (chickens) and River calls Boca fans \"Bosteros,\" (shit-cleaners). In Argentina, friendly ribbing is common. Even Boca fans now call themselves Bosteros. Men call their skinny wives and girlfriends \"Gorda\" (Fat Girl)\nThey call darker skinned people \"Negro\"\n\nThis is the culture. \n\nIn further context of this song specifically, it's specifically about football, not racism. They're suggesting that France \"farms\" players to be a better team. \nTranslation is:\n\"They play for France, but their parents are from Angola. Their mother is from Cameroon, while their father is from Nigeria. But their passport says French.\"\n\nI understand that and appreciate that they may not intend it to be hateful. I know it requires cultural sensitivity the other way to not have another stupid Cavan situation.\n\nBut the insinuation is they aren‚Äôt French. While you can argue Europeans should understand the cultural context of Argentina, it‚Äôs hard to not be aware of people making Europeans of African descent feel excluded and prejudiced.\n\nThe joke is they‚Äôre not French bc they‚Äôre black. Almost all of their team was born in France. They‚Äôre French.\n\nThe saddest thing is that the insulting intention of the song is against the white population of France, who do not contribute players to their national team. But in Europe they are so racist that the French identity of a player with African heritage is a sensible issue, because in their own country they are questioned and a far-right anti-immigration party was about to win the elections.\n\nThat‚Äôs interesting and I don‚Äôt think people considered that. It is pretty crazy how handily white French are being outplayed by their black compatriots.\n\nNah, the only \"racist\" part is \"you passport says frsnce but you're all from Angola\"... Which... Y'know\n\nWhich... Y'know ??\n\nBe more precise please because I don't know what you mean\n\nI mean that France has centuries of bloodshed and taking the resources from their colonies in Africa, even to these days. So yeah, the absolute majority of their national team is made up of migrants who came from those exact colonies.\n\nIt was a harsh truth to process? Or you thought that i was just being racist? Nah, it's not that common in Argentina to be one\n\nAcross the history every single country or empire took advantage of colonies and war... this is a stupid point.\n\nThese players are born and raised in France, they are French, end of the story.\n\n&gt;These players are born\n\nThat's a lie for two of them.\n\n&gt;Across the history every single country or empire took advantage of colonies and war... this is a stupid point.\n\nIt's not when they're still under the thumb of France, but that doesn't matter. What matters is how 20 drunk guys with no upper education didn't fathom the idea of one of their chants having a single unapologetically racist rhyme...\n\nThe song says:\n\n\"Hear all\n\nSpread the word\n\nThey play in France\n\nBut they are all from Angola...\"\n\nI think it's more a banter of them \"being\" from a different country but playing for France. It's more related of them being a bit mercenary like, nothing to do with race.\n\nNo this is the translation\n\n\nListen,\nEveryone now!\nThey play in France,\nBut they are all from Angola.\nHow beautiful to see,\nThey start running...\nThey‚Äôre Comets (like fucking transgender)\nLike the gay Mbappe.\n\nMost of the players from the french team were born in france so that doesn‚Äôt even make sense.\n\nThese chants were only targeted to black players and not white players like laporte who was actually born in france but plays for spain.\n\nAlso with their reasoning they shouldn‚Äôt even play for Argentina but for spain, italy and germany.\n\nSo yes it is definitely racially motivated.\n\nNah, if that was the case, then why didn't they mock Hugo Lloris, who is fully of Catalan origin? It was clearly about targeting the Black players.\n\nNothing to do with race ???ü§£ü§£ü§£\n\nYup, they are teasing the French for hired guns and tottally ignorant about how immigration works. Nothing racist on the chant but their bad reputation maybe catches up.\n\nits not about them being mercenary, its about a country that on these days still robs Africa of their \"resources\" and \"talent\"\n\nTop bantz!\n\nlike apparatus cow scary rainstorm many husky rinse shelter homeless\n\n *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev)*\n\nWell‚Ä¶ There are no \"argentinian names\" to begin with.\n\nMessi is an italian name, Fernandez and Maradona are spanish names, De Paul is a french name (sigh), etc.\n\nMaradona is Gallego not castellano (aka Spanish)\n\nGalicians are spanish as far as I know\n\nI said spanish, not castillan\n\nBut that's hardly Argentina's fault. More the fault of the countries that colonized Argentina and the rest of the Americas.\n\nOr Garnacho lmao\n\nIt's one thing being racist but I don't understand why these people feel the need to show the world how racist they are, pretty weird.\n\nNo consequences, instead more following, makes you dumb dumb\n\nCos footballers are thick as shit\n\nBecause they're comfortable being racists since it's a part of their culture. And they're uneducated.\n\nDon't say Cuti Romero is one of the players too, Spurs will have nightmares of PR this summer, since Bentancur racist comment to of all people, his teammates Son Heung Min, added with his water bottle fiasco. Imagine 2 racist cases and 1 assault case in a span of weeks.\n\nRemind me where most of the nazis escaped to after the war?\n\nüìé\n\nThe US and Brazil, among several other countries. As a matter of fact, the US had an official state-sponsored relocation program for Nazi scientists and military leaders. The former helped them develop their war and space exploration industry. And the latter were used as poster boys for the \"Clean Wehrmacht\" myth, and the rearming of West Germany, while they were allowed to form SS apologist and Nazi nostalgic organisations on US soil. \n\nListen, I agree that Enzo's chants were horrendous, amd the FFF is right to sue, but stay on topic and don't embarrass yourself. Argentina harboured many Nazis, but so did most of America, and we never did so officially Plus, we also harboured the people who assassinated them afterwards. Look up Pavelic.\n\nIt wasn't harboring them. We flat out recruited some of them smh\n\nPaperclip et al. wasn‚Äôt the same as SS officers seeing asylum in Argentina. There is a reason it has a reputation for harbouring Nazi‚Äôs, because it did, in great numbers.¬†\n\n&gt;Paperclip et al. wasn‚Äôt the same\n\nYou're right. It was much worse. Because Paperclip brought in more nazis, did so as an official government policy (and not clandestinely, as Per√≥n did), shamed and censored critics by accusing them of spreading communist propaganda (which they also did with survivors of Japanese war crimes and human experimentation) and funded their reallocation and propaganda efforts so as to use them as political tools for the rearming lf West Germany.\n\nThe US. Mostly.\n\nThe US mostly, remind me where the neonazis walk freely the streets? I give you a hint, it's not Argentina\n\nNo surprises, argentina is a racist country\n\nIt even has a nazi government now\n\n[removed]\n\nDude, your country is colonial, the ground you‚Äôre on literally used to belong to a native population\n\nMy country is a former colony. That's an entirely different thing from a COLONIALIST country. Weren't you taught that back in school?\n\nSo let me get this straight - your direct ancestors formed a colony and displaced a native population‚Ä¶ and you aren‚Äôt colonialists?\n\n1) My country does not have formal colonies as we speak.\n\n2) My country never engaged in formal colonialism after the declaration of independence. I am not a citizen of the Spanish empire. \n\n3) My country is not engaged in informal colonialism, resource extractivism nor political lobbying in foreign parliaments. \n\n4) Some of my direct ancestors were Peruvian and Bolivian natives, you idiot.\n\nMost of your points are nullified by the fact that your country attempted a war of expansion over the Falklands.\n\nAnd your final point is exactly the point. SOME of your ancestors may be native (not Argentinian natives btw, I won‚Äôt ask what happened to them). Most Europeans of a normal background had ancestors that played no part in colonizing foreign lands - yet your direct ancestors clearly did.\n\nNow look, I‚Äôm not trying to shame you over that fact, I‚Äôm just telling you to get off your high horse. Nobody is responsible for what previous generations have done, we all had no part to play in history.\n\n&gt;Most of your points are nullified by the fact that your country attempted a war of expansion over the Falklands\n\nAt the time of the Malvinas War, my country was ruled by a military dictatorship installed, supported and financed by the US  and Britain as part of Operation Condor. The military junta's popularity was at an all time low, so Galtieri carried out the invasion as a desperate, demagogic last ditch attempt to ingratiate themselves in the eyes of a furious public which called for urgent restoration of democracy. Best case scenario, they won the war and ruled Argentina for decades. Worst case scenario, the war lasted long enough for them to pass neoliberal legislation that did away with most of the country's economic protection and nationalised private debt. Over the following decades, many opinions have been held about Malvinas. Some, like our president, believe we should just relinquish our claim. Some others, like myself, believe we should uphold the constitutional mandate and continue appealing for a diplomatic restoration of Argentine rule over the islands. But one thing that has, for the most part, been agreed upon by everyone (except fringe groups and the families of some fallen veterans) is that the war was a supremely stupid and illegitimate action by an illegitimate government, not a civilian one. See? I could have easily dismantled your argument by pointing out the obvious fact that even if I were to concede that the war was colonialist, the military failed to keep hold of the islands, so we are not a colonialist nation at the time. However, since I care about you, I thought I should give you an educated historical explanation so that next time this pops up, you won't regurgitate oversimplified pre-school history classes like a parakeet.  \n\n&gt;had ancestors that played no part in colonizing foreign lands\n\nThe French and British governments have colonial overseas territories right now. They also practice illegitimate foreign intervention right now. This doesn't have anything to do with their ancestors, you were the one who brought that up. \n\n&gt;we all had no part to play in history.\n\nI'm not talking about your colonial history, I'm talking about your colonial present.\n\n[removed]\n\nWhich of the players are indigenous in your current squad? They all look spanish with a few exceptions. Argentina is a former colony ruled by its former colonial ruling class. they became independent but not decolonised.\n\n&gt;Which of the players are indigenous in your current squad?\n\nWtf does that have to do with anything? OOOOH, I get it. You think a country is automatically not racist if it includes full blooded, visually apparent natives in its football team. I see, you're just an imbecile spouting nonsense, sense for clearing that up ü´∂üèº. \n\n&gt;They all look spanish with a few exceptions\n\nIt's astonishingly amusing for you to attempt to call other countries racist or colonialists and then come up with this shit. Since it's not visually evident to you specifically that these players have native ancestry (because they \"look Spanish\" lmao), they must all obviously be pure blooded Europeans, never mind the fact that Argentina's Spanish, Creole, Black, Italian and mestizo populations have been intermixing for hundreds of years. Yeah, not racist at all, mate. \n\n&gt;Argentina is a former colony ruled by its former colonial ruling class\n\nDo you have a single fact to back that up üï∂Ô∏è? I'm serious, I want you to provide evidence that the Argentine government and ruling class is descended and/or the same social group as Spanish viceroys and traders.\n\n&gt;independent but not decolonised\n\nLmao you also never went to school. Decolonised is a term used for colonies, not for colonial empires, you twat.\n\nArgentina sent their black people to wars with the pure goal of whitening the country, which really would worked tho, no?\n\nnot comparable to what French did in Algeria and tons of other nations.. Europeans acting as if they are the angels of the world, lmaaaoooo...\n\nThats actually fucked\n\nRussia is doing this today with various ethnic minorities.\n\nDoesn‚Äôt surprise me at all tbh\n\nAnd unbased, the formerly enslaved people had little to stand on so a big majority joined the armed forces of the country that liberated them, they were in the first line like everyone will tell you but also there they were militias and mestizos without lands. Still they weren't eradicated in those wars but were absorbed into the country and it's people (10k african descendants in buenos aires a few years before 500k European migrants came to the city)\n\nIt wasn't about skin colour, even if now people want to make it about it\n\n&gt;Argentina sent their black people to wars\n\nYes, many of our first-confederate and later federal provincial governments did that for some of the wars of independence and later in the War of the Triple Alliance. It's a disgrace and an indelible stain on our country's history, which is unfortunately not taught in schools as much as it should be...\n\n&gt;with the pure goal of whitening the country\n\nThis, however, is bullshit. There is absolutely zero proof that an ethnic cleansing was deliberately carried out, or that whitening of the country was a widespread motivation for the disproportionate deployment of black troops. The truth is that black Argentines were mostly slaves (before 1854) or descendants of slaves (who were born free from 1813 onwards) who were forced by rich families to take their sons' places in the war effort. \n\n&gt;which really would worked tho, no?\n\nFunny thing is, it didn't. There is a reduced black population in Argentina, but there is a substantial amount of black descendance in the current Argentinian gene pool, which didn't develop a collective identity because of intermixing with native, European and mestizo population, the early abolition of the slave trade and yes, granted, the marginalisation of their cultural expressions in media.\n\nAnd the price for whataboutism goes to: ^\n\nI said Enzo is an idiot and the FFF is right to sue. I also admitted that there is rampant racism in Argentina, so it's not really whataboutism, is it. I am not claiming Argentina is not racist, I just find it funny that a Frenchman calls Argentina a racist country as if France's hands weren't covered in much worse, much more recent bloodstains.\n\nadmitting a fault doesn't really make you immune from whataboutism,\n\n\"yes we are racist today but did you know that French have a history of even worse racism?\" - how does this sound to you, be honest\n\nEnough with this \"history of racism\" and pretending like European racism is something of the past. We're criticizing the present. Neocolonialism from France in Africa is a very real thing, so is European imperialism, anti-immigration and racial bigotry. And it's perfectly possible for a reasonable person to both criticize racism in Argentina and in Europe happening today. \n\nThe other user is not engaging in whataboutism. You however are deflecting legitimately criticism by misconstruing current issues as something of the past. Do you seriously not realize that the rhetoric of the song is exactly the anti-immigration rhetoric of the far-right National Front in France that keeps getting more votes every election? That is happening RIGHT NOW.\n\nStill whatabouttism\n\nNot really if I openly admit the racism in my country and make no apologies for it though.\n\nTotal whataboutism. And you have to search old story for it, ridiculous whataboutism. Your national team is racist, and stupid enough to show it to the world. Period.\n\nIt is whataboutism. A does X and you brought up well what about B, didn‚Äôt B do X too? They are both wrong, regardless but it takes attention away from the Argentina incident.\n\n&gt;it takes attention away from the Argentina incident\n\nThe reason I'm not engaging in whataboutism is that I'm not trying to draw attention from the fact that my country has a problem with racism. I admitted it and I want it to be clear that it is a major issue, with no excuse or justification. It's not my fault you have a short attention span and/or poor reading comprehension.\n\nHowever, what I was arguing was an entirely different matter, which is that Frenchmen are not qualified to call Argentina a racist country without a serious introspection beforehand.\n\n\n&gt;A does X and you brought up well what about B, didn‚Äôt B do X too?\n\nThat was not my argument. My argument was more along the lines of: \"Yes, A did X and it's disgraceful and reprehensible for A to do so. That said, it's ridiculous for you specifically to feel entitled to point fingers as if B doesn't also engage in X, to a much worse extent\".\n\nIt‚Äôs honestly impressive how you keep doubling down on this lol you can argue about it all you want, at the end of the day it is whataboutism. \n\nIt‚Äôs rich that you call out reading comprehension and then use my A vs B example and spell it out the same way even if you think it‚Äôs not because you added words in. It‚Äôs still ‚ÄúA did X but what about B also doing X?‚Äù Not that I expect you to comprehend any of that. \n\nAnda palla bobo.\n\n&gt;at the end of the day it is whataboutism. \n\nBecause you say so? Don't make me laugh. \n\n&gt;spell it out the same way\n\nThe fact that you think I spelled it the same way is why you either need reading comprehension or have a crayon stuck up your skull. The part I never included in my argument was the \"but what about\" bit. Specifically to make it clear that my repudiation of OP was a separate argument from Argentina's racism issue, which I acknowledge and deplore. But if you really don't get that after me spelling it out like that, then you really are a lost cause. \n\n&gt;Anda palla bobo.\n\nEven in this you want to be like us, and desperately fail. Alas, poor you.\n\nPrincipal of a Clown School right here ^\n\nArgentine was and is a refugee place for nazis.\n\nI'm gonna copypaste what I said in another thread because I run out of words if I have to reformulate this whenever some historical illiterate pops up with what he thinks is an easy potshot against an Argentine. \n\n&gt;Argentine was and is a refugee place for nazis.\n\nMoreso in the case of the US and Brazil, among several other countries. As a matter of fact, the US had an official state-sponsored relocation program for Nazi scientists and military leaders. The former helped them develop their war and space exploration industry. And the latter were used as poster boys for the \"Clean Wehrmacht\" myth, and the rearming of West Germany, while they were allowed to form SS apologist and Nazi nostalgic organisations on US soil. \n\nListen, I agree that Enzo's chants were horrendous, amd the FFF is right to sue, but stay on topic and don't embarrass yourself. Argentina harboured many Nazis, but so did most of America, and we never did so officially Plus, we also harboured the people who assassinated them afterwards. Look up Pavelic.\n\nAmong others Adolf Eichmann and Joseph Mengele, the man who experimented on babies, found a safe and warm refugee in Argentine, funded and supported by then president Per√≥n and the Argentine government.\n\n&gt;Among others Adolf Eichmann and Joseph Mengele, the man who experimented on babies, found a safe and warm refugee in Argentine\n\nI know that. Guess where Mengele also found refuge. That's right, in Brazil, where he died at his beach home. \n\n&gt;funded and supported by then president Per√≥n\n\nYes, this is true. I never denied that a dark blot in Argentine history is the leniency with which Per√≥n, a filo-fascist himself, allowed Nazi refugees to establish themselves here. What I am saying, however, is that Argentina's Nazi harbouring past is no darker than most Latin American countries, where several populist leaders also encouraged and welcomed Nazis. And it's certainly a much lighter past than the US's when it comes to reallocating and funding Nazis.\n\nAdolf Eichmann wasn‚Äôt sent to Israel he had to be brought in by Mossads agent. Argentina had zero cooperation as late as in the 70‚Äôs\n\nI never denied that. Your point?\n\nOh look, another European bringing up the Nazis, their own European creation. Like we're going to get lectured by someone whose country was neutral to the Nazis in the middle of WWII. Your country literally has organized neo Nazi groups like the Nordic Resistance Movement today and you have the gall to say Argentina is a refugee for Nazis. European self-righteousness can be a hell of a drug\n\nPretty fair response. I‚Äôm English and that would apply to us as well\n\nWe are not, you stupid fuck.\n\nWhat has France got to do with winning Copa America? Argentina players are daft. Don‚Äôt they know their geography? They should be singing about Columbia bc that‚Äôs the team they played against. Morons.\n\nProbably Stockholm syndrome\n\nCan Argentina players do anything but ‚Äúracist and discriminatory‚Äù remarks?\n\nWin trophies?\n\nLeast deserved WC win, though.\n\nThis is just silly lol.\n\nItaly 2006.\n\nAnd yesh sure, a team with 2 losses in 4 years is just getting handouts üôÑ imagine being so salty.\n\nI‚Äôm agree with the punishment, but as a black Argentinian guy ( native Indian color ) living in Europe and traveling around. I can guarantee 100% that there are more racism here ( not in all countries of course ) than in Argentina. It‚Äôs easy to say ‚Äúthat it‚Äôs racist ‚Äù without see your own racism against Indians, Africans and also Latin people.\n\nReal actual systemic racism is almost a non issue in Argentina, unfortunately this ignorant and stupid chant is making it seem like in the country of Argentina suddenly everyone is a racist.\n\nMind you a country with a lot of darker skinned people even within the Team itself as there is native blood running through many not just European.\n\nThe Chant is Wrong 100%, no Excuse and Enzo should be disciplined for it.\n\n But man there is Alot of projecting going on with this and its just a low blow and jab to generalize a Whole nation because of a few drunk idiots on a bus, also so many of the comments trying to minimize the win and the team itself nothing to even do with the chant itself. \n\nReal rational /s\n\nI hate generalizing, and I think saying an entire nation is racist because of a single case is stupid, but how can you reasonably say that this is a single isolated case when argentinian players and fans have been infamous for their racism and violence for decades? When every other libertadores match, argentinians will be racist towards opposing crowds? When a lot of the posts on r/fulbo and other argentine subs are people saying racist things or downplaying racism (including this Enzo case)?\n\n\nAgain, I dont think all argentinians are racist but this is not a single isolated case thats being blown out of proportion, but a pattern that can be seen for decades.\n\nI know that it's difficult to understand to outsiders that argentinians knows that in football terms all songs doesn't have a real mean. And is because we don't have real racism here. That's why songs agains another countries ( where the racism really exists ) should be ban from our culture, but inside between teams it's pretty normal and will be\n\nBefore i Answer i want to Clarify again that i think The Chant is Wrong and am NOT trying to defend it, so please Consider that with what i will say, im simply trying to put some perspective and context.\n\nTo put it i simply, It looks and sounds way worse than it is. Let me explain, While it is completely wrong and unacceptable. These chants and banter in Argentine culture are really only that, once the game and celebrations are over and all of that it sorta of just goes away? \n\nArgentina does not really have this recurring hateful violent racism like you see in more developed countries, like This chant wont extend to getting people lynched, hurt, killed, etc. Look up most hate Crimes by country you will not find Argentina in the Top ten probably even 20. Ironically you will find USA on top, France, Germany, Spain etc. Real systemic and generational Racism exists there not in Argentina. At last not at that high Level.\n\nThe people online that are defending the chant are For one Not necessarily Argentinian, probably some online edge lords trying to make this worse. and For those that Are actually Argentinian They see it as mindless banter and dont understand the reason why its seen as a bad thing, Mainly because they have been trolling and bantering like this for decades. Its Pure Ignorance from some Argentineans that cannot comprehend why in 2024 talking about ones nation of birth can be taken offensively, how would they when they are limited to having Race Issues within their own nation. Again i am not defending them and i need to stress that because on the comments lately this whole thing is either black or white with no gray area it seems.  \n\n\nRacist and hateful chants dont just come from Argentina but also from other Countries when they play each other like in Libertadores, Argentina has been subjected to timeless Violence and slurs from Brazilians for being Argentinians as well, Its Wrong for sure, but you cannot single out Just Argentina where for decades its been back and forth. this is just ONE example of many.\n\nLook its ALL Wrong, not defending any type of Xenophobic words or chant from anyone. All i want to clarify because of some of the comments i have been reading is that so many are turning all of Argentines into racists and i find that offensive and ignorant in itself. \n\nThe Chant is wrong, the players are dumb and ignorant for doing so and i hope they get disciplined for it. It would be a good lesson to everyone once and for all.\n\nIt's not about individuals but about world class players engaged in campaign for the FIFA against racism and discrimination of any kind, it's about players that are models for million of kids around the world.\n\n[removed]\n\nThey're all born, raised, educated, trained in France. According to your logic no player on the Argentina team is Argentine\n\nRacism aside their point doesn‚Äôt even make sense. Singing about French players‚Äô parents coming from other countries when the majority of Argentina‚Äôs team is of European descent.¬†\n\nWhat percent of their roster is actually of native ethnicity? Messi certainly isn‚Äôt and Enzo himself seems at least mostly European and is named after an Italian.\n\nRacists were never known to be particularly self aware.\n\nWhat percent of Argentina is of 'native' ethnicity? less than 3%. Not a big surprise there aren't soccer players among them.\n\nYou‚Äôre reading too much into this. They picked few words that rhyme, not that much thought went into it\n\nJesus Christ, this is the equivalent of singing a rap song with the N word in it. \n\nThe outrage is ridiculous.\n\nSerious question: the article states a legal complaint, where would that be filed? Unless I‚Äôm mistaken in how I‚Äôm reading the article, do they intend to take them to court or just FIFA?\n\nA long time ago there was a lot of commotion in south america because an Argentinean new outlet was covering a tragedy and the title was: \"2 people and 1 Bolivian dead\". I wish I was kidding but they played it, you can look it up. Most are incredibly racist, even toward their own mapuche people (who a lot of them are part of).\n\nNo, We are not incredibly racists, that slang was Indeed a Dark joke that ended on tv and was looked down by the whole country, to the point that Cr√≥nica TV (the channel) stopped being a prestigious and well-known channel, no one takes it seriously anymore.\n\nWith that being said, ofc the chants Are racists and should be punished.\n\nI always knew Argentinians were racists, I worked in a place where I‚Äôd see thousands a day and out of all the races/nations they were the worst attitude wise but didn‚Äôt make sense to me at the time.\n\nHey guys where should we file a complaint for the Rwandan genocide? Europe is so hypocryte. You literally slaughtered civilizations, traded slaves and built your wealth upon the Blood of innocent people and get offended when an ex colony mocks a country for not using players identified with their nation. History repeats itself. You destroyed a continent and now abuse your position of power to use the players of your former colonies.\n\nFIFA should clamp down HARD on him if they are serious about no to any type of racism\n\nI think the chant was funny and not terribly harmful. It is true that most of France's team is not ethnically French. I don't think it's racist to point that out. However, pretty much none of Argentina's team is ethnically Latin either. So definitely hypocritical. But I don't think it's terribly racist. The chant didn't say anything BAD about africans. It just said that France's team is african. Which is mostly true.\n\nWhat's so racist about the chant? He's implying France squad are full of hired guns. You can only fault Enzo's ignorance about immigration policies and the bad rep of Argentine players and spectators over the years. He may or may not be racist but this chant is not.\n\nIf there's one thing about Argentinian sports, is that it's full of racist and discriminatory remarks\n\n[deleted]\n\nIf City can literally get away with genocide then I‚Äôm pretty sure Argentina won‚Äôt lose their world cup because of a chant.\n\nWhich city?\n\nOh please\n\nSo strip spain, France, Germany as well?\n\nNeed to go back in time 80 years to justify your actual recent behavior? When is the last time Thomas M√ºller sang the wrong verse of our Anthem? Right, it was never. Go FYS, and greetings from Germany.\n\nI can go back 10~, when the Germany players chanted how we gauchos walked and acted like monkeys. I wouldn't be calling anyone else racist with so much on your own back...\n\nWho cares what they sang honestly\n\nLmao\n\n[removed]\n\nBut there are very few african players playing for France. \n\nMost of the black players on the french team are french.\n\nRacism is deeply rooted into Argentinian culture. For them, colored people belong to trees.\n\nSource: my country is extremely racist so i see it everywhere else\n\nSource: I made it up.\n\nRevoke their international accomplishments and ban Argentina for playing any tournament (WC and Copa) for the next 10 years. There is no room for racists in this world and there needs to be sat and example.\n\nThey'll never do that, they love Messi too much.\n\nLmao\n\n[removed]\n\nTo be honest they need to suspoend Argentina for a tournament like worldcup or south americe cup .\n\nAfter worldcup it was the same those players do not know how to behave in a normal way so its time they learn the hard way .\n\nBut they need Messi to play in 2026.\n\nI was watching the final and i am afraid to say it here but after they changed Messi they played better lol .\n\nNo surprises that Argentina are racists and terrible winners. We learned that after FIFA arranged the World Cup win for them. Most disgusting team I've ever seen.\n\npenaldo fan still trying to cope after almost 2 years, lmaaaooo.. increase your copium, it must be hard to be a fan of a loser, loll...\n\nNot a fan of Ronaldo, but thanks... That rapist is a terrible role model for children around the world.\n\n???\n\nArgentinian players are the worst..that much was obvious after their win against the Netherlands and the fact that their star player is a convicted criminal, opposite Robin Hood who has stolen millions of Euro's that would have been used to help the sick, children and other people on need of care by the state\n\nSick children are amazing.

What bullshit. Netherlands fouled like crazy, their players were caught harassing our pen takers, they talked just as much shit. The only difference is your trash bias\n\nFair take, lost all respect for Messi after commiting tax fraud. Add to that the attempt to recoup lost wages during covid via Ceferin/Uefa money. was the nail in the coffin for me. Greedy bastard is set for 200 lives, but loves when the defrauded ‚Äûplebs‚Äú applaud him. The way they played that game against ned, I‚Äôd probably would have pulled a Zidane and get sent off the face of the planet if I stood on that pitch. I wouldn‚Äôt been able to contain my temper. For my father Netherlands we‚Äôre the arch nemesis in football. To me it‚Äôs ARG. From Germany ‚úåÔ∏è\n\nYeah and also after the game when he started mocking the Dutch staff was infuriating as well.
