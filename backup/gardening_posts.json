One pack of lettuce (25 cents) sowed a 6 ft round patch of beautiful, delicious leaf lettuce. One pack of peas (33 cents) has given me at least 2 gallons of peas. \n\nThere are a few down sides. First their quantities don‚Äôt seem to be super consistent. One pack you‚Äôll get 50 pea seeds, the next you‚Äôll get 12. But feeling around to make sure the pack is full will fix that. \n\nNext the seed packet info is next to useless. It‚Äôs just extremely general information. It has me sowing peppers and brassicas at the same time in 9b. Yeah‚Ä¶that ain‚Äôt happening. But again‚Ä¶simple fix. Just do a bit of research. \n\nLast is, they don‚Äôt have a super large variety. Just standard, mostly hybrid or long time favorite heirlooms. But if you‚Äôre spending a quarter for your basic lettuce you don‚Äôt feel so bad spending $6 for a pack of fancy tomatoes online. \n\nAs I was checking out, the clerk lady gave me the ol hand cupped over the mouth and said ‚Äúat the end of the year they mark ‚Äòem all down to 1 cent / pack‚Äù.

    "body": "There have recently been several posts about bugs in this subreddit about ‚Äúwhat is this bug and how do I get rid of it.‚Äù I totally get the instinct to remove bugs. But it‚Äôs worth remembering that we‚Äôre all part of a bigger ecosystem, and every creature, even the ones that seem pesky, plays a vital role.\n\nCaterpillars, for example, are essential in food chains. They‚Äôre herbivores, which puts them near the base of the trophic levels‚Äîjust above the plants they eat. Predators like birds depend on them for survival. A single nest of chickadees, for example, needs 6,000 to 9,000 caterpillars to raise their young to maturity. That‚Äôs a mind-blowing number, right?\n\nWithout bugs like caterpillars, we lose pollinators, decomposers, and critical food sources for birds and other wildlife. And that all trickles back to us‚Äîless pollination = fewer fruits and veggies, disrupted soil = weaker crops, and so on.\n\nIf a bug isn‚Äôt invading your home or harming anything, the best thing to do is let it be. If you‚Äôre like me, you garden because you love nature. Living in balance with nature means not disrupting those who aren‚Äôt harming us. So please consider throwing away your pesticides and next time you spot a caterpillar munching away on a tree, leave it alone.",

I‚Äôm looking into community gardens now and a few other suggestions that you guys made, and I‚Äôm so grateful for the advice.\n\nThis can be removed if it‚Äôs not the right place to post, I just need a little vent. \n\nWe have lived in the same apartment for over three and a half years now, and each summer I‚Äôve received nothing but compliments on how lovely my patio looks. Every single one of the apartment ladies, my neighbors, the maintenance guys, almost every time I am outside someone compliments it and says ‚ÄúI wish I could grow plants like you do!‚Äù It‚Äôs very heartwarming and I‚Äôve even given away a few propagates to my neighbors and at least two of the apartment employees.\n\nNow the property manager says her regional manager thinks my patio is cluttered with too many pots and she agrees. We got a note on the door that says I have to remove the plants within 24 hours or pay a $150 fine. Mind you, I do have a lot of plants, but I meticulously place them all to be as visually appealing as possible. I‚Äôm studying botany and microbiology in college and these plants are very important to my studies. There are no plants in the walkway. I have shelving against the wall of the apartment and the other big plants are up against the railing rather than on top, out of sight, and I have moved them very little since we moved in a few years ago. The lease says I‚Äôm allowed to have potted plants, but at the managers discretion, so there‚Äôs really not much I can do. I moved everyone inside and my kitchen looks like a botanical garden.\n\nI already received too much devastating news this month and my plants are one of the few things that bring me any joy anymore. Maybe I‚Äôm just too sensitive, but it really upset me when she said my patio is a cluttered mess and threatened a fine. I have OCD and was raised by military people- I KNOW what neat and tidy looks like. \n\nIt is what it is I guess. Sorry for the long rant, my world is crumbling around me and this was the small straw that is threatening to break my back. ü•π",

I have broken branches and plants with stems broken right down the base and of course lavender that is squished down the middle. Each plant cost me about $12, not to mention the zinnia/cosmo/shasta daisy seedlings in between, so it‚Äôs not nothing. \n\nI‚Äôm still giving the kid the benefit of the doubt and let his parent know what happened, that I was the second time and if they could please remind him to not ride there in case it was intentional. They did not take it well‚Ä¶\n\nNot sure what to do, I‚Äôm tempted to take it all out and replace with ground cover, but I‚Äôm thinking that‚Äôs my sadness talking. \n\nUpdate:\nI did end up filing a police report, but didn‚Äôt press charges. I would prefer to protect our peace and just end this here instead of continuing something that would bring more drama and my husband is in agreement, but now we have some recourse if it happens again or escalates. I also saved our video evidence so it doesn‚Äôt get deleted. \n\nI will leave the plants there to see if they recover, though I feel lavender will have a tough time bouncing back from being smashed down the middle and may not recover to a pleasant mounded shape. If I remove them, I‚Äôm considering bougainvillea since it does well here and the ones I have in my backyard are mean and tough as hell as well as adding boulders. \nMany swears are sweared when I prune them. \nI‚Äôm not sure how to keep it as ground cover or prune it in a cottage garden style.\n\nI appreciate y‚Äôall for understanding my garden woes üòÇ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\n",
