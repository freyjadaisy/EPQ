    "all_comment_text": "Slowly recall all your mind\n\nDecadence isn't easy, IS IT\n\nSong is free nitro boost!\n\nI could plow through the oncoming Rhinos when this song‘s playing\n\nPretty sure it doesnt play during cop chases\n\nTrue, it's been too long. Time to dust off my copy and jump in again!\n\nThe chase song is one of my favorites and it has a racing version too! Name is The Mann\n\nIn game it's not even 1 song! its actually dynamically mixed out of a sample library, with clips selected depending on where on the map you are, how fast you are going, and whether the cops are actively chasing, you lose line of sight, or you're getting busted.\n\n\nGo play it or look at a video of a chase, notice how the music changes depending on what's happening in the chase. More games should do dynamically mixed soundtracks.\n\n\nThe radio callouts are dynamic too, once you get familiar with the made up 10-Codes in the game you can use the radio to know what the cops are going to do next so you can stay ahead of them.\n\nWhy your soul’s gone cold\n\nAnd all hope has run dry\n\nDead inside, Never enough to forget that you're one of the lonelyyyyy\n\nSlowly recall all your miiiiiinnnnddd\n\nDUHDUNDUH dun DUH dun DUH dunnnn\n\nDUHDUNDUH dun DUH dun DUH dunnnn\n\n[removed]\n\nThis post came at right time. Need this nostalgia drug right now\n\nYou build tolerance to it. You need newstagia.\n\n[I'll just leave this here.](https://youtu.be/te8keFz5ZdI?si=pAKDydX03TWugfx7) Help that Nostalgia even more.\n\nMan, me and my younger brother were huge disturbed fans, when we got this game, it was the only song we had playing. We no longer talk, but this made me miss him.\n\n[deleted]\n\nClick. Pow. Nien. Thou\n\nThat and do ya thang are the best I still listen to them daily\n\nWhen soul gone cold, and the hope has run dry\n\nI SAW YOU LOOK AWAY\n\nBmw just made a one of one of [the cover car for this game](https://www.bmw-m.com/en/topics/magazine-article-pool/bmw-m3-gtr-need-for-speed-most-wanted.html) thats in bmw world.\n\nThat... wasn't how i imagined the inside looked.\n\nEdit: I meant that when I played the game all that time ago, and it never showed the interior of the car you're driving, I imagined a normal car interior. \n\nI was, like, 7 or 8 years old, watching my older brother play. And I've never seen the inside of a racecar before. Apologies if I wasn't clear.\n\nI mean it's a racecar, what did you expect?\n\nI just imagined a normal car interior. Two bucket seats in front and a bench in the back.\n\nUnderstand that I was young when I played MW.\n\nBMW was supposed to make 10 road going versions to make it legal to race\n\nBut the rules changed before they could so they killed that program and stuck the 3 they finished in their museums\n\nSee [this](https://www.bmw-m.com/en/topics/magazine-article-pool/bmw-m3-gtr-strassenversion.html) to see how the street-legal version looked inside.\n\nUnderstandable. I was young too but my family has a motorsport background and I grew up being at racetracks nearly every weekend.\n\nI remember how disappointed I was when I (as a non car guy at the time) first saw an actual race car irl. Just bare metal with shitty foam everywhere, long ass shifter like a fucking bus from the 90s, just looking like absolute ass with no thought of aesthetics. Then I realized these dudes don't give a fuck they just wanna go fast\n\nWasn't it a street race car? A lot of those guys don't even have a roll cage\n\nThe car it's based on (what you see in the pic) was built for American Le Mans Series\n\nThe BMW in the game is a recreation of a full on race car. So this is actually the most accurate representation of the car, because it IS the car.\n\n[removed]\n\nYeah, this comment confused me too, because it's not like you can't see the inside in the model. Guess you can't if you're playing it on a console on a 480i CRT though.\n\nI got goosebumps while reading it lol\n\nYeah thought so that it's BMW world, that car wasn't there mid year, so it's pretty new then, i should go there tomorrow and look for myself then.\n\nEdit: I was there and i tried to take the same photo but i couldn't be arsed to squat down to get the same angle. Still, it's really cool to see.\n\nHoly shit it’s beautiful\n\nBetween this and Razor being in the newest Unbound update, I'm officially on the copium hype train that a 20 year anniversary remaster, remake, or sequel is coming in 2025\n\nI was at the car and someone said that the actor for Razor will be there in person in about 3 hours. I also saw they put the car in an Update for Unbound so probably they also got the actor for it and all this is a big promotion event.\n\nOh god I'm a JDM guy myself but I have a soft spot for BMWs and I would die to have one of these.\n\nGod fuckin damn I loved that game\n\nThe last really good NFS game. The series peaked with Underground 1, Underground 2, and Most Wanted.\n\nMan, I *loved* NFS:Underground 1. Also one of the very few games that made me literally threw my controller because of the randomly spawning traffic killing your whole run. \n\nI think I might ~~set sail to the high seas and~~ try to re-experience that again this weekend lol\n\nRandomly??\nI swear that some of it was on purpose.\n\nThere was this one race where there were like 7 laps or so where you start in the sewer. It felt like an etenrity to finish the race and fucking all the time when I was first in the last lap, a random car would appear almost impossible to avoid.\n\nAlso the AI suddenly driving faster than they should be able to go.\n\nYeah, the AI slingshotting past you is called rubber banding. It’s what lazy developers do to make it ‘more difficult’\n\nI swear NFSMW coded traffic to appear where you would drive on circuit races.  First lap it would collect data and on the subsequent laps it would place cars that overlapped with where you drove in the first lap.\n\nI also remember playing hot pursuit a lot\n\nThe Hot Pursuit remake in like 2011ish was the last time I remember having fun with it. Drifting a One-77 around a teardrop with Lupe Fiasco playing is a core memory for me in college.\n\nI loved NFS Porsche before that\n\nThat whole era of NFS is absolutely iconic (Hot Pursuit, High Stakes, Porsche Unleashed) but I think Porsche Unleashed was underrated because it was unusually mature. Great driving feeling for a game of that era though.\n\nBuy every Porsche 550 that hit the market.\n\ni also really like pro street, but i agree that most wanted was the all time peak\n\nI loved Carbon and hated Pro Street\n\nIt was a very much different genre of racing game. It had the right idea, but sloppy execution with delayed handling. I did have fun with the game tho, even finished it twice.\n\nProStreet was made by a small studio with very little budget. It is incredible for what it is. Im currently replaying it again with a few mods to fix the handling and improved graphics\n\nCarbon was my favorite nfs. The drifting in that game shoooooowweeeeee.\n\nCan't forget carbon\n\nI assure you that I can.\n\nCarbon has some cool elements, but is overall worse than the 3 games that came before IMO, mainly due to them moving even further away from the physics model of U2. U2 was the peak for car physics, and MW the peak for gameplay, and not a single arcade racer since has captured the atmospheric magic those 2 games managed.\n\nI think burnout paradise was pretty fun\n\nGet this traitorous dog a plank.\nHe be on the wrong ship.\n\nLoved carbon, especially the music and drifting but it was a definite drop in quality compared to the previous 3 games.\n\nCarbon is underrated imo. I didn't like the looks of MW and played Carbon way more.\n\nI played them all extensively, but for me Carbon was my favourite.\n\nThe canyon drifting events in the supped up Viper were crazy! Would get your adrenaline and frustration going. But I still prefer MW, the gameplay made a massive jump with that game.\n\nNFS Heat was a really solid entry and Unbound is getting regular updates unlike the previous two.\n\nThe original Hot Pursuit for PC is still my favorite to this day.\n\nI’ve always been partial to Hot Pursuit 2\n\nYou mean Love. It’s still available and even a copy that makes it HD. Played it like 3 months ago. Still so much fun.\n\nPoint me to it because I've looked for years and can only find the 2012 Most Wanted.  Every time I visit retro game stores it's the same story, all 2012 no 2005.\n\nthe seven seas, matey. the game's been abandonware for years because of expired licenses\n\nor just use eBay\n\nIt's abandonware now. Dont know if direct links are allowed but Google the term and it will lead you to a site where it's been archived and you can download it for free.\n\nyeah there's a reason why can't find NFSMost Wanted 2005. because it was that good...\n\nthe internet archive has a clean copy of the Black Edition, and the game keys/patch files that allow the game to be run without a disc are usually a google away, hope this helps!\nEdit: a phrase\n\nR'amen\n\nI wonder, what's with NFSMW being brought up a lot lately. Like several reddit posts and new YT videos about it\n\nIt's twenty years old. Nostalgia recycles stuff back up around then.\n\nI’ve got it sitting on the shelf and I probably haven’t played it since 2005, I think I’m going to play it again. I\n\nEscaping the cops on the highest wanted level was nuts back then.\n\nI AM ROCKK!!!\n\nthere ain't no breaking me\n\nI AM ROCK\n\nDid anyone 100% that game when one were a kid?\n\nYes, and no nfs game since has scratched this itch.\n\nYup, it had the best cars, map and customization.\n\nNot too sure about that. It feels like a downgrade in customisation after underground 2. Just the aesthetics maybe helped a lot\n\nYeah, there were definitely less customization options in MW. Aesthetics, music, the cops and their sheer numbers, and the Pursuitbreakers are what make this game, imo. They really nailed the cinematic movie car chase scene feeling.\n\nThe little cinematics before the race against a boss were hard as fuck. \n\nEvery single boss car was a beauty\n\nHeat was pretty good, even if its weird that a 240Z can be faster than a F40\n\nTbh MW was basically the same too. I like it tho, i love making my golf into a supercar.\n\nI love heat but playing at 30 fps on the PS5 is not really doing great for it :(\n\nEvery oldschool NFS fan owes it to themselves to give Heat a shot, it's not at the same level, but it's the closest they've gotten since and is a damn fun game.\n\nShame what they did with Unbound right after, I had hope.\n\nUnbound was to cringey for me, bought it in a steam sale but refunded it. Heat was ok\n\nI was on the QA team for this game and we had to 100% for Microsoft and Sony. Took many shifts to complete,\n\n\"Took many ***shifts*** to complete\" - nice one ;)\n\nI was adult, but yes.\n\nAlso an adult, and yes.  Think I've played at least some of every NFS since the original, which I was a kid for I suppose, heh.\n\nNfsu2 was the one i 100%d\n\nNfs games are easy to complete no?\n\nCampaign? Yes, pretty easy.\n\n100% challenges? I remember some being quite hard, some others being luck-based.\n\nLoved the pursuit ones with the garbage truck \n\nI spent countless hours playing the challenge that starts near the donut shop by the baseball stadium because it was a convenient way to start a pursuit and immediately get onto the ring highway.\n\nOr sometimes I'd head for the little roundabout and just drive in circles and it'd confuse the hell out of the cops.\n\nMan, it's probably been like 10-15 years since I last played MW05... I might have to install it again and start a new 100% playthrough.\n\nThis game is the reason why I am in the car scene now!\n\nGod damn you have a sweet ride man\n\nSame and NFSU2\n\nI still play this...\n\n'Classics' that was last week in my mind\n\nI have thought about that BMW every single day since 2005\n\nMy sadness when I thought it would be a popular mod car that one could easily get into. This car has an absurdly low production number. I think 7 were made ever\n\nJust engine swap a normal e46\n\nThat’ll be about 50000$.\n\nNaaah, an old e39 with the 3.5-4.0 V8 goes for like 5k€ and double that for a new ecu and wiring etc. miscellanous stuff. Installing the whole thing yourself in one winter and swapping over the stuff you  need is free. A shit condition e46 is like 3k€.  Its gonna be 15-20k project but hey some people put that much into a civic.\n\nAnd those 7 were the street legal version, the MW Hero car was based on the track version. (Though you can use the street version in the game too it’s not as cool)\n\nThey’ve made a remake for this game, and a remake of that remake already :(\n\nI still have my original disk. Checked that it worked over the thanksgiving break.\n\nI designed that livery for the game :)\n\nProve it! (respectfully)\n\nGabriel Frizzera, now apart of What If games, based in Vancouver, [the about us page seems to add up.](https://www.whatifgames.net/people)\n\nIf they posted any in work photos, that would be sick.\n\nYeah that’s me. I was at EA from 2003-2009. Worked on Underground 1&amp;2, Most Wanted, Carbon and Pro Street.\n\nDid you do the liveries for ProStreet as well? Those are some of my favourite cars in any racing game ever\n\nMost of them, yeah (I think was most of the livery department at the time :). I have a soft spot for Pro Street, I got to do a bunch of cool graphics for the circuits as well.\n\nThat's so so cool. ProStreet had such an awesome aesthetic and I still go back and play it today. [I even made a few iRacing liveries using the ProStreet game files. ](https://www.tradingpaints.com/profile/401049/Aidan-M). Also, I just went and wishlisted Kinshft, it looks super cool!\n\nThis needs more upvotes. \n\nBro is the whole reason that BMW is so iconic!\n\nWell not the sole reason :) but thanks for the compliment.\n\nHonestly it could be. As a kid like 13 years ago I wasn't into cars at all and would only see passing glances at the game's cover and recognize it as NFS Most Wanted. Not because I knew it was a BMW or any particular detail of the body, but because of the iconic livery. As an adult I'm more into cars and now I'm a lot more interested in the rest of it (Looks like a JDM-style BMW and that makes me very excited) but I definitely only recognized the car because as a kid the livery was burned into my memory.\n\nIf you made me guess before right now if someone asked me what car was on the cover of NSFMW I would have no idea and just guess some popular jdm car from early 2000s\n\nI was responsible for livery design in the NFS series since Underground, and it fell on my hands to design the hero car livery for NFSMW, as well as all the boss cars (and Cross’ cop car, which is still one of my favourites).\n\nThat’s so damn cool. All of the boss car designs from most wanted 05 are iconic.  What are you up to now?\n\nAfter EA, I worked at Kabam for about 10 years, where I was creative + art director for Marvel Contest of Champions (kind of a dream job for me where I got to concept, redesign and even create original characters for Marvel). Then I left to start my own indie studio, What If? Games. Not so great timing as the game industry went to shit… it’s been an uphill battle, but we’re having a lot of fun regardless. Our first game is called KINSHFT and we just launched a Steam page if you want to check out, wishlist etc : https://store.steampowered.com/app/3370960\n\nLooks awesome, thanks for sharing\n\nOh my god. You are the goat. Thank you for that.\n\nHow does it feel to have that livery be so beloved?\n\nHonestly it just hit me recently... Been seeing more people pop online with nostalgia about that design, never thought it was so beloved.\n\nIn any racing game with a custom livery editor and a Bmw (or bmw adjacent/knockoff/off-license whatever), I've seen it be recreated. It's a cultural cornerstone in racing games.\n\nCool, it’s always awesome to see your work appreciated. I remember staying late that night painstakingly moving pixels around to make the design flow perfectly with the BMW’s shapes.\n\n[deleted]\n\nif so, then ur a fking legend bro! hahahahaha :D\n\nMan. You created a trully iconic and recognisable livery! Thank you :)\n\nThank you for liking it :)\n\nFor that specific car?\n\nFor the hero car, the BMW on the cover\n\nWow.  were there a few different ones that could’ve been used and yours won the vote?\n\nDon’t think so, no. I believe this one was pretty much the only design, and the one that stuck.\n\nFucking legend\n\nYou're a legend.\n\nNo fucking way!!! Absolute legend. I’ve always wondered who designed the livery. You are the reason why I love BMWs. They should be paying you royalties\n\nYou made a Masterpiece.\n\nBelieve me, it still resonates with both the NFS fanbase and car enjoyers to this day\n\nRespect\n\nPlayed this game on repeat in my dorm in the military, got into car culture, ended up with a magazine cover show car. Most importantly I ended up with friends from that scene that I still hang out with nearly 20 years later.\n\nWild how the little things you do can impact so many people for such a long time.\n\nYou are a complete legend, amazing!\n\nThe best design. I have a few questions:\n\n1. Underground has a [vinyl](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/nfs/images/3/38/NFSUG1_Vinyls_Side_Stripe_15.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20231015192043&amp;path-prefix=en) that, perhaps, was made by you. Is it the one you used as a foundation for Hero's M3 GTR?\n2. Did you also make the one for Carbon? M3 GTR, I mean. I'm asking because this game introduced vector vinyls to the series, and they can be extracted. Hex color codes are 17306A (fill) and FFFFFF (outline). It does seem different from MW. Both are definitely darker than the one in the picture. Do you happen to have some files or values lying around that could help? I want to know the exact colors used.\n3. Did you also design Darius' Audi Le Mans quattro for Carbon?\n\nWow that’s a really cool picture!\n\nThe best NFS.\n\nUnderground?\n\nClose. Most Wanted 2005. UG1, U2 led to MW. Tbh. I only say MW because you could nominate only one as best. In fact UG, MW and Carbon are like peak NFS, a peak to which or closer to it, NFS only reached few times afterwards. With Run and Rivals.\n\nThis game man this game\n\n*hits the supports of a giant donut sign*\n*cops buried in donut wreckage*\n\nClick (click) pow (pow) knocked (knocked) out (out)\n\nI thought it was click, pow, nine, thou\n\nIt is. \nThe song is called nine thou.\n\nI know, i have it on my playlist for driving\n\nHeck. Yeah.\n\n\" Styles of Beyond - Nine Thou \" plays in head.\n\nThis is the way\n\nSome people wait decades for moment like that. Thank you for all of them.\n\nThat was the best Need for Speed game. The police chase were so much fun\n\nLegendary\n\nHad this game on the GameCube. Wow this game was amazing! The cars, music, cop chases. Ah, so good!\n\nWould have been a better composition if it was a blue box not x box green\n\nThis is why PC has the best box. No colors over the box art, just an iconic grey and \"PC\".\n\nThat game was the best\n\nThat is bad ass\n\nThis photo deserves some reward from bmw\n\nYou don't know how much I still want to do this. Like first time I played and that car showed up I was like \"yeah, that's the one I want\"\n\nBack in my day,  games had awesome soundtracks.\n\nHardest.\n\nIncredible picture. Loved that game so much. \n\nI played NFS underground 1, 2, Most Wanted, and Carbon. I'd say NFS:U 1 and Most Wanted were the best.\n\nGod I miss those days, where I'd get together with 5\\~10 friends to have a LAN party and play games like this together. Such good times.\n\nDo LAN parties even still happen? I don't think so, honestly. Everything just happens over the internet now.\n\nWhen I bought the PS4, I went to check immediately what new NFS were there. And none of them could be couch coop. So disappointing.\n\nWish they made most wanted backwards compatible\n\nI'm more of a nfs underground 2 guy because I've always loved the nissan 350z, but most wanted is for sure my 2nd place, it was really good, in fact I dare say that those 2 games were the absolute peak of this franchise.\n\nAlways triggers that song in my head seeing this\n\nI loved the shit out of NFS:UG and UG2 but holy moly did I play the ever living fuck out of Most Wanted. It has been so many years I don't remember why anymore, but I remember having two copies of it. It's possible I lost the first one or something like that, maybe it's because one of my consoles broke? Regardless, it's like the only game I ever bought more than once for whatever reason and I beat it / played it so much. Even as an adult I uhhhh... sailed the seven seas to relive some nostalgia. Great game, love NFS.\n\nM3 GTR, they made 10 of these right? where the hell even is this one?\n\nOK I will admit this is tuff\n\nNFS: Most Wanted (2005) needs a rerelease, along with the Underground games and Carbon.\n\nNot a remake, just an Enhanced Edition to get them a touch more stable on modern OS and a few fixes.\n\nI am rock\n\nI think you mean NOStalgia\n\nI remember when I had this game I had a 2 and a half hour pursuit.\n\nFucking damn I loved that game.\n\nwow this is so cool!!\n\nfascinating how there's a nostalgia thread about NFS:MW about every 2 seconds but no one plays the games (new nfs) anymore? Or even racing games (not sims) anymore?\n\nReminder: This game outsold the ENTIRE HALO FRANCHISE. Not even Halo 3, a game that had Fortnite levels of hype back in the day, sold more copies than this masterpiece. \n\nYet they delisted the game so you can't buy it anymore digitally, the physical copies are overpriced, and there's absolutely ZERO chance for a remake or remaster that isn't horrible since modern need for speed Devs can't actually code proper handling models. \n\nBut this is indeed one of the best pictures I've ever seen. I think it speaks volumes of how impactful the game is when there's multiple people who are willing to spend thousands on kitting out an old BMW M3 to look like a car on the cover.\n\nThe reflection is just too clean "

    "all_comment_text": "GTA 3, Vice City, San Andreas, and 4 all came out within the span of 8 years\n\nYou know what's crazy? It's been more time between GTA Vice City's release and now, then between it's release and the year it's set in (1986)!\n\nThe really weird thing is making an 80's nostalgia GTA not even 20 years after the 80s ended. If they did it today the equivalent would be a GTA set in 2008...\n\nAnd we still have a gta set in 2008 granted it was released in 2008\n\nAnd its pretty damn modern and playable till this date. It truly was a huge leap from San Andreas in certain departments.\n\nEngine and physics wise for sure. But I definitely think San Andreas was such a massive leap over Vice City and 3. It really pushed every boundary that was capable on that generation's hardware and its engine.\n\nIt still somehow maintains more than 10 thousand players on unofficial servers on SAMP (quite a big following in poorer countries where most people don’t have money for high end computers)\n\nIt took me a while to find an original pc version to set that up with. Found it at Hastings sometime right before IV came out.\n\nI had forgotten GTA IV was that far back.  GTAs III, VC, SA and IV were all released within the span of the Bush administration.  The US will have had at least 4 more presidents by the time time GTA VI is released.\n\nIV was so good. I actually never finished V though - the storylines just didn’t hook me as much.\n\nIt's definitely worth finishing, I think the single player is a bit underappreciated these days because people lump it in with GTA:O.\n\nI feel like V's story has the least amount of bite out of any of the other GTAs. It's not terrible but for some reason I couldn't finish it and I tried twice\n\nBeen in love with GTA since III too\n\nWe’re just getting old friend.\n\nThat 70’s Show parodied the early 70’s in the late 90’s and were now much further from the 90s than the 70’s was at its time of release.\n\nHey!\nIt ended at NYE 1980\n\nDon’t be mean \n\nHow many years did it run, again?\n\nIt went for a while, I think from 1998 to 2006 or something.\n\nThings also changed  much more culturally between decades tho. It's seems like we just get fancier versions of 2010 now...\n\nI'm kind of convinced that because there's no catchy way to say the 00's or 10's that those decades basically don't exist culturally like the 50s/60s/70s/80s/90s...\n\nI have also had this thought. That's why everything blends together after 2000.\n\nCatchiness aside, you used to be able to tell what decade a photograph was taken in and even early or late in the decade *very* easily in split seconds. If you gave someone 3 pics from the last 20 years and told them to date them. It'd be pretty difficult unless there were very specific tells. \n\nWhat does 2008 look like compared to 2014? 2014 to today? Now do 1991 to 1999. 1970 to 1977. It's infinitely easier if there isn't like, I dunno, razr phones or Mumford and son's posters up. If immediate tells aren't there, it's damn near impossible, lol\n\n00s era early digital cameras are pretty recognizable.\n\nIn the 00’s to 10’s the resolution made huge leaps as screens also became better.\n\nIn the 10’s to now you still see improvement in the sensor and the lenses. The color dynamics are way better and there is a better and bigger focus.\n\nPlus digital enhancements the phone does for you.\n\nThe fact that my phone takes better pictures than the medium quality digital camera I had in 2004 says enough.\n\n2000's photos (early digital cameras) have a very distinct look. I'd feel very confident in pointing them out.\n\nGTA: San Andreas was released in 2004 and set in the year 1992 which is a 12 year difference. \n\nGTA V was released 11 years ago.\n\nokay this one hurt\n\nTo be fair the 2000s does feel pretty nostalgic too...\n\nIt’s crazy how the 19xx’s had such definable decades. Vice City was amazing because of the setting, 08 just wouldn’t hit the same. What is going on?\n\nAccess to the same old videos is actually kinda disrupting how nostalgia works.  Let alone our relationship with the entire concept of \"history\" ...\n\nI was thinking about that the other day. It’s so insane.\n\nI'd like to unsubscribe from crazy facts\n\nThen consider this one a bonus:\n\nThe average air conditioning unit contains more radioactive material than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima.\n\nNot true. Not even REMOTELY true... ... \\*cries\\*\n\nBro..\n\nA perfect opportunity to again point out that the playstation 2 had 3 GTAs and GTA 5 has had 3 playstations.\n\nYeah, but when you have the money printer that is Grand Theft Auto Online why would you bother with anything else? /s sorta\n\nI think that's absolutely a huge part of it but GTA has always tried to push the boundaries, top down, large maps, larger maps, first person, character transitions etc etc I think part of it is waiting for the tech to do what they want. I hope. I have never played GTA online but damn sure I'll buy the next one\n\nIf the map leaks of GTA 6 are correct, it's going to be a huge map.\n\n1 state please\n\nAlso the hype is insane so they have to deliver.\n\nNo, with GTAV, it really was literally just about the money.\n\n3, VC and SA came out in 4 years.\n\nA lot more crazy said this way.\n\nWhile I was in high school, 3 GTA's came out. I'm 35 now and I was in college when GTAV came out.\n\nWe were so spoiled back then. Video games were coming out left and right and they were **all** bangers.\n\nFuck man I’m getting old\n\n[removed]\n\nSame here, I remember back in 2012 when there were fake GTAV videos emerging on YT. I was a teenager back then, now a full time adult.\n\nHalf time adult here, and I remember those as well. I picked it up for my 360 and fell in love with the game but the fps and motion blur made me a bit sick, so I couldn’t really enjoy it until it was on PC\n\nWhat’s a “half time adult” 😂\n\nHis upper half is a grown man and his lower half is little baby legs\n\nWade Wilson?\n\nJust straight shirt cocking it\n\nLike a Winnie the Pooh party up in here\n\nI'm coming baby legs! I'm... regular legs.\n\nBut is he a police detective with a partner with regular legs?\n\nHe is a police detective in a wheelchair. We call him “Wheelz”\n\nIs that the guy who is friends with Roy Rogers McFreely?\n\nhttps://youtu.be/-o0Qp5J_Oo8?si=ov9UfEodmuhcVwHN\n\nHe briefly turns into an adult during the break at basketball games.\n\nI'm not sure. I am only an adult hobbyist.\n\nLmao\n\nStudent and/or paying rent to their parents. Some, but not all, of the responsibilities of a full adult\n\nI see now. Thanks\n\nI bought the first one (the bird's eye view one on PC) from a Best Buy in the 90s.  I was a teenager.  Fast forward to picking up GTAV last year when my son bought himself a Series X.  Wow.\n\nAdult when need be, I remember my nephew playing one of the first ones, he had to show me the energy up with the prostitute, good times\n\nDamn..  I can't even believe this shit.  They went from a gta every couple years to 11 years?  They really hit this cash cow and just said \"welp!  That's it, then!\"...\n\nBlows my mind this game was on 360.  I got my 360 when I was like 15, almost 20 years ago.\n\nChild in adults body here. I still play GTA 3 from  2001.\n\nHe did but hates to be remembered as Trevor.\n\nI follow his Instagram page. \n\nHe’s a little….unhinged to say the least.\n\nHe's just still in character in case they need him for GTA6. Such impressive commitment to method acting.\n\nI think he's actually a real life asshole and it was just easy for him to tap into. Because every role is him acting like Trevor and every non-acting appearance I've ever seen... is him acting like Trevor. \n\nI get the same vibe from Bill Mosely (Otis Firefly) as well.\n\nThat could just be typecasting. He got his break for being that character, so that could be what casting agents are expecting.\n\nBill just plays Otis incredibly well, and Otis is a pricks prick. \n\nHe's a pretty gregarious \"good, how are you!\" type in interviews so I doubt he's an asshole.\n\n&gt; I follow his Instagram page.\n\nI will not be looking that up again thank you very much.\n\nIt’s just him being eccentric… It’s not that weird. \n\nI expected to see some fucked up shit. I want my time back.\n\nHe went from GG Allin to AA Gill\n\nIs that why he played litterally Trevor in The Walking Dead?\n\nAnd Better Call Saul.\n\nAnd Pike from Snowpiercer! &gt;!The character having so much potential for such really good arc from murder hobo to chaotic good guy with huge PTSD problem, but noo instead they just killing him off in lame duel ugh was such an opportunity to go from \"old snowpiercer rules\" to \"new life\" but now Ruth is alone and it's sad and they deserved to be together! T-T!&lt;\n\nOh that's awesome! I love that fucking show, that character, and Trevor from GTA V\n\nHis opening scene in GTA V where he's banging Johnny's girl and recognizes Michael's Mobspeak is the best\n\nThank you, I was wondering why he looks familiar.\n\nFun fact. He originally auditioned to be Negan. He obviously didn’t get it, but the casting team liked him so much they created an entirely new character for him on the show. \n\nActors do hate when they're always thought of for only one role. It's probably worse than not being recognized for any big role, because then they get typecast. That's why Lance Reddick took the role he did in the John Wick movies. He wanted to escape the typecasting.\n\nHe's always going g to be the creepy locksmith from 1 episode of Broad City to me.\n\nI remember staying up all night to play online then the shit literally loaded all fkn night 😂\n\n[deleted]\n\nDiablo 3 was pretty bad.\n\nPTSD from the screen just showing a sultan in a parking lot for hours\n\nI love how we all knew it would be a shitshow and we all tried anyways.\n\nomg yes, the load times were a pain. I don't think I got online the first night they opened it up.\n\nmy shorts is literally filled with edits of him acting menacingly on stage during comicons (?) with transitioning to trevor from game\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd I flipping love it watching the same shorts over and over again lol\n\nAll i read is \"my shorts is literally filled\"\n\nI still reckon Steve Ogg is the acted character and he just is Trevor irl\n\nOgg came into my work for lunch pretty much every day for a month or so whilst he was filming that Boiling Point, was constantly chatting with or observing us as to get ideas for the role as he was playing a chef in the show. Really sound guy, proper talkative and boisterous individual. \n\n  He pretty much is Trevor, but replace the fits of rage with that Jack Sparrow-esque goofy quirkiness.\n\nSo this character? \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCxgUPFVFkA\n\nShout out to Amyl and the Sniffers they fucking rock.\n\n\"In its own fucked up way.....it's perfect.\n\nGod damn beautiful even.\"\n\nI remember the early days of online, like the few months after release. No flying vehicles with missiles, no one had enough money to buy planes because none of the businesses existed yet. Running Rooftop Rumble on repeat because it was quick and paid $21k.  On Xbox 360 no less.\n\nUntil the hackers come in to the lobby and drop you 300mil with no way to spend it. Obviously Rockstar fixed that and left you with 400k which is nothing now\n\nHaven't logged in for years, but I definitely remember somebody no clipping straight to me, warping in some big blown up vehicle to trap me in, then dumping money on me like I was a stripper. Shit was wild back in those days.\n\nI had EXACTLY the same experience. \nHonestly, I attribute that to a large reason I was never able to get into the online. \n\nI got all excited and brought all the cars and the biggest penthouse and just felt hollow… \n:(\n\nThat happened to me but it was never corrected. I lived large for a bit and I got bored.\n\nWhen online came out, which was about a month after the gane had come out, my friends and I would spend hours just trying to invade the army base, steal a jet without getting blown up and then mess with everyone in the public lobby. Good times.\n\nBeing able to buy the hangar there and have permanent clearance, is one of my favorite things in online.\n\nlol I've been playing online for 7 years and I still haven't bought a P996 because I can just steal it from the military base, when I get asked why I haven't bought one I just say I'm waiting for it to go on sale 😆\n\nI miss the old days of online too. I was there from the start. It was so much fun, now I wouldn’t go on there to save my life. Nothing but cheaters and griefers. Can’t go five seconds without some dickhead on an Oppressor blowing you up.\n\nFlying cars/motorbikes as well just kinda ruined it feels like a big mess.\n\nThere’s actually things called “peaceful” lobbies now for each platform. You have to follow a set of rules to be accepted laid out in Discord, but once you are in, its great. You can pop into the Discord and ask for help selling, and everyone is willing to help if you help back. There’s community events and car shows. \n\nIf anyone blows up your stuff, they have to take a video and explain how it was an accident, or they get banned.\n\nSomeone hacked millions of in game currency into my account on PS3 in 2013. \n\nI remember staying up all night grinding that and violent Duct and Covet just to buy and Enity and a Adder \n\nIt’s also been 11 years since Steven Ogg was happy to be trevor.\n\nIt’s weird because I was always familiar with the poor history Rockstar and their voice actors for GTA protagonists have had, and after GTA V released all 3 voice actors seemed so into their roles and genuinely enjoyed being the stars of such a big project, I honestly thought Steven Ogg was the most enthusiastic of the three after the game launched, so it’s really strange to me to see the decline in his attitude towards being associated with the role.\n\nI think his issue is that he is *only* recognized for his role of Trevor and wants to be known for other things. He's a great actor, he was great in Better Call Saul, West World, even Walking Dead.\n\nWhich I understand. And I also understand wanting to be acknowledged as an actual person rather than just the fictional character he portrayed. I don’t really hold those things against him. The thing is that in those other roles (I’m assuming for WestWorld, I haven’t seen it before) he has only played minor characters (he had a very small role in Better Call Saul and while he had a bigger role in the Walking Dead I’m not sure that his character was really ever a major or leading one). The significance of his roles in those shows aren’t nearly as culturally impactful as his role as Trevor. So while yeah he has done a lot more to be recognized for other roles, it’s easy to understand why he’d be primarily recognized for what I and I’m sure many other people would argue to be his most recognized role.\n\nIt's not the recognition, it's having a horde of mouth breathers wanting to have you yell Trevor's lines on command like a trained monkey.\n\nScooooooter brothers\n\nFor the uninitiated, that line in 5 is a reference to this 4 video https://youtu.be/GxKj_CmtHRI?si=CtOadRLghAs4iVMN\n\nTrevor would have handled this differently.\n\nThis is it, right here. I've seen those clips and it's honestly disturbing. Crowds with phones pointed his way as one weird mouth breather basically wants to be degraded by Trevor, in public, like some weird fetish.\n\n\"Hey! Heeeeyyy! I'm Rick James, *bitch*.\"\n\nWell put. \n\nI've seen some of his Instagrams where he likes to hike and muse on things and he seems a rather deeper fellow than ppl expect, sometimes talking poetry and books he's read, or great films that inspired him.\n\nBut then when he walks down the street it it ONLY \"Trevor Trevor Trevor can you quote Trevor can you cuss like Trevor ahahahah!!!\" \n\nI think he has a right to be pissed when he's reduced to a quote monkey. I wouldn't be surprised if some of the fans didn't even bother to call him Steven Ogg and called him Trevor instead.\n\nGuys like Ogg either go the path of rainn Wilson or rob Schneider.  They either age into the realization that they were one of the lucky few that even *get* such an iconic role, or they just spend their time bitter about not getting even more.\n\nI'm so glad Rainn seems to have come around about all the Dwight stuff. He was clearly resentful for a while and it was a bit of a bummer, but he seems to be leaning into it now.\n\nEh I saw one of the recentish interviews and it seemed more like he’s just pretending to be okay with it.\n\nWhich is which? Idk anything about Rob Schneider, but I could definitely sense some subtle resentment from Rainn Wilson in one of his interviews.\n\nHe's a talented actor with some good credits, but Trevor is his best performance.\nThat doesn't mean you can't build an audience outside of that.\nTo link up the Better Call Saul connection, Michael Mando who plays Nacho used to be most widely known for portraying Vaas in Far Cry 3 back in 2012.\nNow he's acknowledged as a ridiculously talented live action actor.\n\nNACHO ES VAAS?!\n\nCould you seriously not tell? Lmao\n\nAnd Snowpiercer, he played Pike really well I thought.\n\nHonestly though, he hasn't really done much else. In your first example I think he's in one episode and has a very minor part. I haven't seen the Walking Dead but I looked it up, 21 episodes, and that looks like his biggest role across all platforms outside of GTA5. A bunch of short films and some stuff that looks like it was straight to VHS-level.\n\nCompare that with voicing the most memorable protagonist in one of the top selling video games of all time. No shit everyone is going to remember him for that. It would be like Michael Jordan complaining that one remembers him for his days playing baseball.\n\nProbably feels he got type casted. Happens a lot\n\n&gt; In your first example I think he's in one episode and has a very minor part.\n\nYeah, he was onscreen for maybe like 5 minutes? And to be honest, the character he played seemed to be border line Trevor to begin with.\n\nHe was great in The Walking Dead though. It was definitely a different type of character than Trevor, and he got some pretty meaty stuff for a \"side\" character. It was definitely more than a one note role.\n\nHe does actually appear in another scene in season 5 when Saul and Kim are investigating Kevin Acker\n\nWell if he is the lead in something big maybe he will be recognized for that. But if he is just going to be a side supporting character, then he will continue to be known for his main and only lead role.\n\nHe should be happy to have his moment of fame at all. I've seen him in a bunch of things, but he's basically a C-list actor who made his big break because of GTA V. Even in his bigger roles he's usually a background character. I think Walking Dead is really the only one where he played a major long-term character.\n\nA lot of actors have this issue. They want to be recognized for other roles. Personally I think they should be thankful they get recognized at all. I'm not a successful actor though so what do I know.\n\nHe's said he only turned on it when annoying fans started to hound him. No fun having people demand you scream at them and being upset when you don't dance on command. It's no different than Rain Wilson being annoyed when people yell HEY DWIGHT HOWS THE FARM at him\n\nIt probably doesn't help that years later anytime he auditions for an acting role. It's only ever for a goon or a maniacal bad guy. He genuinely seems to want to branch out and play other kinds of characters but that's hard when he's constantly being viewed as Trevor\n\nYeah, it really sucks when actors end up getting type cast.\n\nHe was fine playing that role on The Walking Dead, but yeah he seems pretty tired of it.\n\nOnly played GTAV for the first time recently and loved Trevor so much that I have tried to watch as much Steven Ogg in other things as possible. It made me a bit sad how much he wound up disliking being known for this character even though it opens up avenues for us to WANT to see him in other things…\n\nI’m hoping that Walton Goggins as the Ghoul in Fallout will sate my skinny psychotic white guy with wild hair character needs for now. I just hope he doesn’t also get disheartened immediately!\n\nMore like 7 years as he happily went to cons for a while\n\nYou guys think we’ll get a 12th before GTA6?\n\nProbably, here's hoping we don't get to 13 though\n\nConsole? maybe... Pc.........\n\nYeah, its gonna probably be six months to a year before PC gets it unfortunately. Rockstar loves to do that shit, ever since GTA3.\n\n3, Vice City, 4, and 5 were all around 6-8 months delay, and all of them seem to be fall release for console, spring release for PC.\n\nGTA 1 was on PC first, and GTA2 were on both at the same time.\n\nAlmost certainly\n\nIt'll be close, it's suppose to release in a year, but there is chatter of a delay to 2026, so IDK\n\nRemember when we got 3 amazing GTA's on the same console\n\nNow we have 3 amazing consoles for one GTA!\n\nTook me way too long to realize you're talking about III, Vice City, and San Andreas. Which all came out within a 3 year span, which is absolutely wild.\n\nThen it only took them 4 years to come out with IV, and another 5 years for GTA V.\n\nReally puts it into perspective of how much they've milked GTA Online.\n\nIt's insane that 3 and SA were the same console\n\nYou couldn't even move the camera in 3\n\nI mean, 3 was the first 3D GTA in general, they were all top down 2d before that. Had to start somewhere.\n\n[deleted]\n\nI just finished RDR2 and it dawned on me how much insane work must go into making a game of that caliber.\n\n[deleted]\n\nI wish GTA online never became a thing. We would probably be getting GTA 7 on the way by now, and already had another spin off like Vice City was at the time. \n\nI still cant get over how once the story was done that there was nothing left to do in the game itself. Like no side missions or building up your side business or whatever. All I could do was go to the airport and steal a plane\n\nTbh that's like every single GTA game.\n\nThat’s half the fun of GTA for me, driving around like an idiot, starting police chases, going on rampages. \n\nSame.  Killing civilians for no reason other than they were in my line of sight and it feels good to be a lunatic sometimes.\n\nThat’s all of the fun in GTA games for me lol, but I’m not a big GTA fan either.\n\nThere was some notable side missions.\n\nhttps://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Strangers_and_Freaks This is most of them, plus there were the random people that would show up on your radar asking help, and a few different businesses you could buy and do missions for, some races, and pilot school. The Lester assassination missions are optional side quests, and they are the only thing that can get you actually rich in that game.\n\nSome of it wasn't very interesting, but there was some decent content there.\n\nI appreciate GTA:O for what it is. It's a phenomenal online gamespace but the controls for GTA have and continue to be a dumpster fire. \n\nRockstar is finally starting to learn how to make Online fun. Their last few additions to online are all pretty enjoyable as long as you're just in a private lobby with your friends.\n\nHowever they're in the doghouse with me right now for how they've completely abandoned the online PC version to hackers. \n\nI'll be curious to see if they step up and actually come up with a secure system for PC for the next iteration of Online but I'm sure as shit not going to be trying it at launch unless they've got their shit together.\n\nThat’s a lot of Shark Cards\n\nI worked at Gamestop when this came out and I remember thinking how the Shark Cards would never sell. :'(\n\nDamn, I'm 30 now\n\nHey, it's the guy from the Amyl and the Sniffers music video! https://youtu.be/jCxgUPFVFkA?si=8T0tWd2xKJTi_j0l\n\nI miss when gta games would get made. Good times.\n\nGTA online is a cesspit.\n\nBest character in the game! Fuckin' Legend!\n\nAnd now he's a dick because he gets mad that people only recognize him for playing Trevor... the role that made him famous in the first place.\n\nit's not even that. a lot of people know him as Simon on The Walking Dead because he was even more compelling than Negan. He gets mad period when people reference Trevor. He always insults or belittles the role as \"just a cartoon\". Yet, it's the thing that made him famous and has gotten him every role he's played since. It's made more money than everything he's been in combined. It literally changed his life, yet he's being such a dick about it that he still doesn't understand that Video Games are a legitimate medium for artistic expression. Hell, this guy doesn't even think much about \"cartoons\" just he uses \"cartoons\" as an insult when talking about video games.\n\nI guess he also doesn't have any respect for books or paintings either. just recordings of things that are \"real\". It's super annoying. You have all these fans that love and appreciate your craft and you get angry at them because they don't know you did some obscure space movie where you flew into the sun or something...come on...\n\nThe guys who played Michael and Franklin and other characters are all very much into it. Steven Ogg doesn't haven't be into it, but the least he could do is not get pissy about people loving his work in GTA. Trevor was literally the favorite of any GTA protag, maybe only second to Tommy, maybe. But the more people learn about his attitude, the more they dislike Trevor. It's really unfortunate how disrespectful he is of the medium/craft as a whole.\n\nProbably got paid shit for it and has since not received  any backend compensation for the literal billions it has raked in.\n\nLooking it up he was paid \\~$55k for roughly a year a recording. Which is standard for voice acting.\n\nThat being said though it's got to sting a bit knowing the game made 8.6 billion since release.\n\nNo royalties at all?\n\n[deleted]\n\nAm I crazy, or did they not also use his likeness?\n\nYes, he did full facial mocap, I believe as well.\n\nwhich is madness, especially for main characters. Should have negotiated for 0.1% of main-game sales revenue\n\n&gt;Should have negotiated for 0.1% of main-game sales revenue\n\nSounds like a quick way to negotiate yourself out of a job.\n\nRockstar: We'll pay you 80k.\n\nYou: how about we make it a cool 8 million?\n\nYea cause there isn't a long list of other actors who would have toom the 54 grand life ain't that easy\n\nFranklin's VA came back for Online updates. I always thought it was odd they never did it for the other guys. Maybe they asked for too much of a raise given the game's popularity.\n\nPeople need to stop badmouthing him like this.\n\nHe doesn't get mad, he has said it's cool that people recognize him from that role.\n\nIt's just not what he prefers to get recognized for compared to other things he's done which is fair enough, he's not a gamer.\n\nRicky Gervais was similarly unenthused about being in GTA IV and he mostly did it because his agent pointed out to him that it was a big deal.\n\nRicky Gervais is well known for many things other than GTA IV. That's not exactly a good comparison.\n\nFor real. I doubt it cracks the top ten of things he's remembered for.\n\nI've seen too many videos of him wasting somebodies paid video by using it to complain about Trevor being a cartoon to have any respect left for him as a fan.\n\nYou make it seem like he got paid off the success of GTA5 and not some set amount that was agreed to before the game released. Maybe he’s a bit miffed at how much it made the company and how shitty his deal was in comparison? This doesn’t excuse his behavior but just an idea. GTA 5 is the most profitable piece of media ever created and he voiced 1/3 of that game. I bet they paid him literal peanuts compared to its success. Hell we just found out they offered an entire band like $25k to split the rights to a song. Can’t imagine they pay their voice actors much.\n\n&gt;. It's made more money than everything he's been in combined.\n\nWould love to see your numbers. Where are you getting them from? Because the voice actor who played Niko Bellic received fuck all in future sales, etc.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/zeMuJbn_OhA\n\nI was hoping it would be the last Anniversary before 5 releases\n\nWe had 3 GTAs released back on the PS2. Now, we have one GTA that’s just been rereleased over the span of three generations of consoles.\n\nI know somebody that worked with him on The Walking Dead. They said he was a really cool dude.\n\nscooter buddy!\n\nSteven Ogg just wants to be remembered for his acting. He lowkey regrets playing Trevor because that’s all anyone knows him for now, even while he was on TWD.\nJust goes to show how great his performance was in GTA5. I hope he realizes the fandom loves him.\n\nWhat’s worse? \n\nGoing back to 2013 and telling yourself you’ll be waiting probably 12+ years for GTA6.\n\nOr going back to 2011 and telling yourself you’ll be waiting 15+ years for elder scrolls 6?\n\nHaha, the actor who played Negan's henchman?\n\n Steven ogg absolutely hates it when people call him Trevor\n\n[removed]\n\nI still vividly remember going into high school the day it came out and the entire male portion of my grade could be divided into two groups, those who were ready to play GTAV the second they got out of school and those not at school because they stayed home to play GTAV. \n\n  \nWe even had one kid go to the hospital because he played the game so long he got dehydrated."

    "all_comment_text": "Holy shit, they un-released a game\n\nReleasen't\n\nDeleased\n\nI didn’t know that this was a game until it *was* no longer\n\nWow, that's nuclear level bad. I've seen games get shut down like a year after launch, but hardly a couple weeks? That's gotta be a new record, even that literal scam game The Day Before had its servers up for a month at least (though to be fair it sold more too).\n\nI did NOT think the day before could be topped but here we are.\n\n$200m and 8 years down the drain. Insane.\n\nWhat’s insane to me is that people keep enabling organizations to treat $200m like pocket change. When that amount of money has been spent developing something like a video game, failure of this magnitude should justify a leadership clean out with criminal liability for mishandling of funds.\n\nLMAO. Those C Suite execs will just get fired and given million dollar severance packages.\n\nThey won’t even get fired. They’ll just be asked to leave and then wipe their tears with $100 bills while they drive home in their Lamborghinis.\n\nThe “good execs” see this type of thing coming and leave before the crash and burn so it becomes someone else’s fault and they keep their own track record clean.\n\nAhhh the ol’ ripping a silent fart just as you exit the crowded elevator.\n\nYou mean they’ll cut a department and continue working there.\n\nThe Culling 2 was a similarly fast shutdown.\n\nOh, sore spot. I bought the Xbox version, really enjoyed it for a while, and then went to play other games. After a while, I went back to play it, and it wanted me to pay per match.. I don't think I've ever been more put off by a game or company.\n\nThe Culling is such a sore spot for me because I actively watched the developers tear apart that game from the beginning. They had such terrible attitudes of never reverting bad changes so they kept adding even worse changes until it drove away their entire core player base.\n\nThat was faster than expected.\n\nIt had 29 active players today.\n\nHoly crap. At that point you might as well name them in the article. \"Sales have ceased, and Steve and Karl you can get a refund  too.\"\n\nThey should be added to the credits.\n\nYeah, but who's gonna see them?\n\nThey can read it to each other like a bedtime story.\n\nThe thing is, the devs themselves were among the player count, so that was probably them.\n\nTo be fair if Sony didn't already have the devs working on ways to potentially convert the game to F2P and \"save\" it, playing the game themselves was probably doing more for the game than anything else they could have been doing at work.\n\nLike at what point do you just kick your feet up and enjoy what little time you have to attempt to enjoy the product you likely spent years working on. They know it's fucked and it's going to get shut down. No point working on future content that will never see the light of day.\n\nWhat about Ricky?\n\nRicky can get a refund after he cleans his room. \n\nRicky is not even allowed to smoke and swear while playing this game so why would he bother?!\n\nit's not rocket appliance\n\nWeird innit?\n\nThere were these game developers right? Got given $200million to make a game. Everythin's normal, everyone's happy. But when they got around to releasing it 8 years later, they realised it was a pile of shite. Nobody was playin' it. So Sony said \"we've gotta work out what went wrong here.\" Went knockin' on the door of these developers, right. Turns out... little monkey fellas with keyboards.\n\nRight, you're talking shit again. Play a record. We're never doing this again.\n\nRicky needs to stop leeching off Steve and Karl and buy his own copy next time.\n\nThats so bad it's actually impressive\n\nI kinda wanna meet those 29 people.\n\nProbably all YouTubers or Twitch streamers making videos about how few players there are. And Gordon. His parents got it for him. Poor guy.\n\nMakes sense, only parents that would name a kid Gordon would do such a thing.\n\nFor real, just hearing that name Stings.\n\n29 in 5v5 game is less than active 20 players.\n\nIts can be maximus 0-2   matches now.\n\nWhen there's only 29 players, the odds of you being the best player in the game go wayyyy up.\n\nTop 30 in the world BABY!!!\n\nSimultaneously, so do the chances of you being the worst player.\n\nAgreed, but I usually already have that in every other game I play. At least with Concord I have a shot at the top.\n\nThat’s five people sitting around trying to find a match? Or is it 5v5\n\nIt's 5v5 so basically 2 games worth of people and the other 9 people have to wait a match length to potentially join in.\n\nThat’s crazy\n\nWaiting for a match is one thing, but waiting for a match because a brand new game doesn’t have enough people to fill three lobbies insane\n\nI know. It's the biggest flop of all time by the looks of it. Honestly we're seeing gaming history in the making lol. Every other game that fails now is going to be *\"Well, at least it wasn't as bad as Concord\"*\n\nLmao it's actually crazy because these numbers are like, really difficult to break. Didn't Gollum do better numbers???\n\nNot only that, Sony was so sure about Concord that they bought the studio!\n\n11 days\n\nIt lasted 11 days\n\nA salad lasts longer\n\nA British Prime Minister lasts longer.\n\nLettuce remember this game fondly.\n\nAnd now lettuce spray.\n\n1.1 Scaramucci\n\nits 1.0  A Scaramucci is 11 days.  [https://joshklemons.com/how-many-scaramuccis/](https://joshklemons.com/how-many-scaramuccis/)\n\nI was just coming to ask how many Scaramuccis that was. Thank you.\n\nCould this be the fastest implosion of a game?\n\nI've never seen a title with this amount of money behind it get sunk this fast. I would love for AAA live service games tanking like this to become a trend.\n\nSomething similar happened to CA’s game Hyenas. Everyone in every beta gave it a bad review. All their other games had people angry as they were raising prices of the DLCs to pay for it.\n\nThey put 100M into Hyena’s (probably a lot more tbh).\n\nA month before it was to launch they just cancelled it. They were getting sub 10k views on YouTube and realized they would lose more launching it than just killing it.\n\nI feel like Sony kinda tried to cancel Concord too, but they had already spent a bunch on CG shorts and the like, not to mention the episode on the video game jamboree TV show coming up in a few months, so they might as well put those out and see where it goes. But all the other kind of marketing, the sponsored streams of the betas, the ads and all the other stuff that they hadn't paid for yet, that seemed very absent before launch.\n\nThis makes Suicide Squad look much better. For a cluster fuck that it is, Suicide Squad is still at least online after six months.\n\nWonder how many half assed live service game project heads just shit themselves.\n\nNot enough.\n\n8 years for what... like 12 days? WOW! Wildest crash and burn ever.\n\nYeah, that's crazy. I'd be utterly broken if I were a part of the dev team.\n\nThey probably knew it was going to crash and burn the moment they saw the monetisation system. A shame truly. Thankfully they got paid, but that's a lot of time that you can't show proudly.\n\nThat's brutal. That's 8 years of your life working for absolutely nothing.\n\n\nEdit: Yes, you get paid, but putting in time/effort into something pointless probably is not good for your mental health.\n\nI wouldn’t say *nothing* – hopefully they at least learned valuable, transferable skills they can use on their next project.\n\nExactly that's almost every job ever.  Do some specific tasks for a company, and a few years later you go somewhere else and everything you did for the past few years doesn't matter at all except for whatever skills and connections you developed along the way.\n\nFor portfolio based jobs though it sucks to pour 8 years into a project and not have it succeed to show off in a resume.\n\nHopefully this discourages Sony from making more live service games.\n\nI never seen something like this. Everyone will be refunded:\n\n[https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/03/an-important-update-on-concord/](https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/03/an-important-update-on-concord/)\n\nEdit: No longer available for purchase\n\nThe good thing is it wont cost them a lot to refund everyone.\n\nstraight up, that may be reason for them to refund like this to begin with.\n\nNo point risking getting sued when the costs to refund are less than the costs of the legal team.\n\nCrazy to think it's probably cheaper to refund the game than keep the servers online. \n\nLegendary flop.\n\nIf sales figures are true they didn't even make 1m from this 200m game....\n\n200m to develop, 1m to de-velop\n\nI didn't know that it existed until people were talking about it having 250 players total.\n\nJust heard about it from this post lmao.\n\nOnly other thing that comes to mind is The Day Before, which resulted in Valve refunding everybody who had purchased the game due to it being a total scam\n\nEpic Games did this for their MOBA Paragon.  Even after it was out for multiple years.\n\nI really enjoyed Paragon and was pretty sad to see that refund come through tbh\n\nFor some of my friends, it was a few grand.  They would've preferred the game to still be around though, as would I.  Check out Predecessor if you haven't.\n\nI think they ended up releasing the game's assets for free on their marketplace, or something like that. There were a variety of Paragon competitors around for a while.\n\nYeah, they are all mostly dead besides Predecessor. It’s the closest to what Paragon was (monolith, not super OG legacy).\n\nPredecessor is now officially supported by Epic Games - they are the continuation of Paragon. Super happy to see the game return, it was a blast back in the day and still is now! Game feels great again and the community is definitely returning.\n\nAlso Paragon by Epic Games, they refunded everyone and released the assets for free when Fortnite BR started to take off. Shame really, Paragon was amazing, but since the assets were given out at least we've still got a solid remake\n\nPredecessor is a great game not gona lie.\n\nAll 10 people will be refunded lol\n\nTotal sales is around 25k. So that’s like total of $1~1.5M in revenue refunded. Not a big deal considering they spent what $200M making it?\n\nEdit: Estimate of total cost ranges from $50-200M.\n\nI wonder how many of those sales are from people buying it just to see how bad it really was.\n\nThat's good. Imagine the fallout if they hadn't. Lol \n\nReminds me of when stadia shuttered. Everyone refunded all they spent towards it. There's hope in the gaming community sometimes 😂\n\nI wonder how retailers like Amazon, GameStop, and Best Buy do refunds if you bought a physical copies? Don't they have a strict \"if it's open, you can only exchange for a new copy\" rule?\n\nThe refund would come from Sony. They will pay for any copies sold that were returned to game stop and stock would be returned in this case as the game is unplayable without live service.\n\nThis might be the biggest gaming failure of all time.\n\nI've had people tell me Suicide Squad and Skull &amp; Bones, but at least those games managed to crack a couple thousand people on Steam. The Concord mess is absolutely insane.\n\nThree of these all during such a short timespan too.\n\nYou would think this would be where the AAA game company bubble burst too, but probably not. These execs will still chase trends like crazy.\n\nExcuse me, only 2 of those were AAA.\n\nS&amp;Bs was AAAA.\n\nfuck, you got me.\n\nThe execs need to be what bursts. Sony should absolutely fire whoever went after and promoted this game.\n\nThe lack of awareness suggests replacing the entire culture is necessary, the public knew and predicted this would fail.\n\nThe entire culture is the requirement to not only make money, but to make increasingly more money with every product. I don't know that it can be replaced. There's just not enough time in the world or enough gamers to sustain numerous MMOs and GaaS when they're all designed to be time and money suckers. Whereas successful single player games make money, they just don't make nearly as much money as the titans like Fortnite or Genshin or whatever. That's not acceptable to these businesspeople. You also see this shit with other digital \"products\" like social media and streaming, they're always trying to monetize every aspect of the experience and try to squeeze out more profit with every year.\n\nAnd theres nothing to say against the Fortnites and the Genshins. But the reality is, there cant be a thousand of them. Back in the days everyone wanted to make a world of warcraft clone because with the subscriptions it was a money printer - and still is i think. But if you settled with one game, you dont wanna check out another, and another, and another...\n\nYahtzee Croshaw said it best in one of his reviews (I forgot which game): You can't demand 100% of a player's time and money twice\n\n\"if you settled with one game...\" \n\nHard truths that so many developers (and more importantly, the EXECS) need to understand. I'm already in on Overwatch. I don't really have space for another game to learn the quirks, get a handle on the style of play, sort through the characters and learn their movesets... \n\nI recognize that OW isn't what it used to be, but I'm already there. It has a strong playerbase and takes me no time at all to jump in, blow off some steam, and call it for the night. Sure there's a ton of other games that are similar and F2P, but so what?\n\nI think the train had already left the station on all these games before the GaaS bubble burst, development takes years. \n\nYeah I'm pretty sure Concord is hundreds of millions down the drain. The game itself is probably around 100-150, + marketing + they have an episode coming out on a show. By the time the episode airs, the game won't even be playable.\n\nWhat show?\n\nSecret Level on Amazon Prime\n\nWell the name's certainly accurate now.\n\nIt’s got to be, especially even the conversation around it is just dead. Nobody seems mad like Cyberpunk 2077 or no man’s sky on launch, it’s just this massive “meh”.\n\nNobody had expectations for this game that's why. Cyberpunk was being created by a company that made one of the greatest RPGs of all time so there was hype behind their new game so the anger was real when it released so poorly. Concord was announced and like you said, it was just meh.\n\nI know all the devs got paid for their years of work.\n\nBut taking the best years of your life only to have it be thrown into a garbage can a month later must be a personal blow.\n\nThis will be in the history books my god\n\nNEVER let them forget\n\nPretty sure this is gaming history right here.\n\nEdit: My research has shown me sofar, no game with this kind of budget and backing has flopped this bad making this the worst flop in gaming history. If someone knows something I don't please let me know! I will edit again if I find out this conclusion is incorrect!\n\nI don't think any AAA game out there has failed this badly before lol\n\nLol I just edited my comment cause I've been looking into it today. And sofar that's correct! No game with this kind of budget and reputable pulisher backing has flopped this hard ever in the history of gaming.\n\nIn times like this I always wonder... There has to be one dude out there where this was totally his game. He's playing for 11 days and then SON OF A BITCH\n\nAt least they get to permanently lock in the status for number 1 ranked Concord player.\n\nit's probably that 1 person in the world who got the platinum\n\nThere was a guy who posted last week about being genuinely proud to be top 100 in the games rankings \n\n[I'm in the top 100 of all players in a multiplayer game for the first time in my life](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1f3r946/im_in_the_top_100_of_all_players_in_a_multiplayer/)\n\nDude could be the worst in the world and still a top 100 player at the same time.\n\nI was top 3 in asteroids at my local arcade as a kid once. Turns out they reset it daily and i was there early in the day lol.\n\nWhen the trailer that came out that got this game ridiculed first dropped, I said the seven players who bought this game could enjoy it for six months to a year.\n\nI didn't expect to eat crow because it shut down after a few weeks.\n\nnot even 2 weeks, this released 12 days ago\n\nI mean technically it closes in 3 days \n\n[deleted]\n\nThey'd probably get more writing this off as a loss than trying to spin this PR disaster in an attempt to get some of that F2P money. They'd hemorrhage even more money with additional marketing and server costs just to keep this game on life support.\n\nYeah, i'm sure their suits did the math to figure it's not even worth the maintenance cost, which shows just how big of a failure this was to them.\n\nParadoxically, you were only wrong because you were more right than you expected\n\nSomeone, somewhere must have sat through countless meetings begging Sony to listen to them. There’s no way no one tried to prevent this massive loss of money. \nMy only conclusion was the game was too far along &amp; too much money had been put into it before anyone at Sony realised how big a flop this would be. \nWe could all see it a mile off.\n\n[deleted]\n\nMILD SHOCK\n\nSony funded 10 such titles. This is, despite the historical proportions, just 1 failure. There are still 9 more in production, and if any one of them hits the billion dollars mark, Sony not only lost nothing but will learn nothing from the mistakes made here.\n\n\nThis all started almost a decade ago, and it's only now appearing on the new releases. So the other games in this desk will start advertising shortly.\n\nRumour is half the live service games they were working on have already been canned around the same time Jim Ryan stepped down and The Last of Us: Factions got cancelled. I believe they only have the ones they've advertised already still in the works, like Bungie's Marathon reboot.\n\nAnd that Marathon reboot is going to crash and burn if the rest of Bungie's recent business and development practices are to go by.\n\n[deleted]\n\nI'd pay money to sit through some of these meetings at that company about this.\n\nCan somebody give me an OutOfTheLoop explanation as to what happened with this game? From cradle to grave? Because I don't think I've ever heard of it outside Reddit these last few days/weeks.\n\nLong story short, Sony released a 5v5 hero shooter game that costs $40 and that no one really wanted since there’s a lot of other games doing the same thing for free like overwatch 2. Being close to a decade late to the party, and costing so much for a generic shooter game it made crumbs in profit compared to how much time and money they spent which is presumably 8 years and an estimated $50-100 million dollars. Sony realized that the game is dead and probably decided to cut their losses.\n\nThat's not enough of an explanation. That explains it being an underwhelming underselling game. Like skull and bones. \n\nIt does not explain the *catastrophic* failure and complete abandoning of the project after only a *few days*, even going so far as to refund it? \n\nWhat on earth happened here? How could it possibly have gone *this badly*\n\nHonestly, that part is surprising everybody, but what is clear is that absolutely no audience ever showed up for the game. \n\nWhen it was first announced, people were let down that it was a multiplayer hero shooter and not a story based game. When people looked at the character designs, absolutely nobody thought they were interesting, and most people had much worse things to say about them. When they announced that there would be weekly new story cutscenes coming out all the time, nobody cared because no one interested in story cutscenes would want a multiplayer only game with ugly character designs. When they then announced that it cost $40, anyone left who was remotely curious about the game was then priced out, and had no reason to try it out over any other game that’s free or already putchased.\n\nLegit some of the ugliest character designs ever made. Color theory gets memed on, but Concord is a prime example on why its so important. The person who thought it was a good idea to combine a sickly green armor palette with neon blue lipstick was out of their mind.\n\nAnother thing, Sony bought the studio, which is only 6 years old, last year for an undisclosed sum.  It was previous owned and funded by ProbablyMonsters.  I think people are completely overestimating the cost of the game, some up to 250 million, which is dumb.  My guess is 50 million.\n\nHelldivers 2 was $100 million as was Baldurs Gate 3. I find it likely that $50-$100 million is accurate for the 8 years and similar sized studios.\n\nEdit: nvm, $100mil is probably on the low end. Their dev team was bigger than HD2 and Baldurs Gate 3 for the same time period.\n\nEven Gollum received more love\n\nGOLLUM SWEEP\n\n[deleted]\n\nThey’ll probably bring it back as a free to play game, right?\n\nI would be shocked if they didn't. Even with extremely low player counts, it's still a functional game, and a F2P relaunch lets them make some updates (cash shop and maybe some character redesigns) and potentially recap some of the investment. Also lets them pick a window without the competition from Deadlock and Marvel Rivals, which certainly didn't help.\n\nThey said they're \"going to explore other options to bring it to more people\" so I think you're on the money.\n\ntake it away for six months, Shake up the character design, change name, drop it as a new F2P game. 100% logical.\n\nThey kind of have to try to recoup the investment, but they're going to need to do more to make the game in any way compelling.\n\nIf they make it free to play and fix the awful character design it will be a reasonable entry to the genre. It will never be a mega-hit like that but it will at least be a cheap patch for them, rather than spending millions more and risking a second disaster.\n\nThis is not a Gollum situation. The game is fundamentally functional\n\nBased off the article it seems like they are possibly going to revamp concord and do a rerelease in the future.\n\nIt’s not a terrible game. The gameplay is pretty solid albeit slow. The issue is it offers nothing different than other hero shooters, and the heroes themselves are woefully uninteresting.\n\nThe reveal trailer actually seemed pretty cool and I thought we would be getting a single player story-driven game. Overwatch 2 failed on the campaign promise; I think it would be in Firewalks best interest to explore that avenue along with revamping the multiplayer.\n\nIf they’re competent enough, I could totally see this game becoming more popular with a re-release\n\n[deleted]\n\nIt's kind of tragic in a way because the reality is that by the play with purely cosmetic microtransactions is way better for consumers than free to play with gacha mechanics and a bunch of other garbage that you need to jump through for content, game developers are going to learn the opposite lesson from the situation. They're going to decide that it's always better to just go f2p, when the actual issue with this game is entirely that it was 40 bucks for something with anemic content and lackluster gameplay. If it was actually a good game it would have sold. \n\nThey'll probably rework it as f2p and it'll likely be a ps+ game sometime between Dec-Feb IMO.\n\nBy the wording they used, it does seem like they aren’t totally scrapping it. So this seems like a good guess.    \n\nWith that show secret level coming out early December and having an episode about the game, that might be a good time to release it.     \n\nI’ve heard about the game a few times, but I honestly didn’t know it was even out yet and now it’s shutting down lol.\n\nOh this will make for a nice yt documentary\n\nThere are more comments on this post than there were ever players of Concord on Steam\n\nYour comment has more karma than Concorde had players over the weekend\n\nI bet Babylon’s Fall is feeling pretty good about itself right now.\n\nLink to official blog post: https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/03/an-important-update-on-concord/\n\nUsing the title \"an important update on concord\" seems like both an understatement, and an overstatement at the same time.\n\nr/concordgame reacted by locking all coments and locking new posts behind mods' approval\n\nThe sub has more users than game has players 💀\n\nThe mods are having a hissy fit. They were dreaming of being mods of a big subreddit. Instead they're still just nothing.\n\nPoor mods, they lost their chance to spend all day working with no payment other than a fake sense of power.\n\nWell, that episode in the Amazon series is gonna feel really awkward lmao\n\nThis has to be the fastest server shutdown I've ever seen for a live service game. Goes to show how much of a failure the game was, damn. \n\nI hope that the people who worked on this thrash fire can get new jobs soon (we know how this will go...).\n\nAnd Sony to get fucked.\n\nHonestly I don't know what they're going to do with the Amazon show, they might just not air the episode.\n\n\nOh the devs are 100% going to struggle. A lot of people are blaming them.\n\nWhat series?\n\nAmazon is doing a series called Secret Levels, which is an anthology series with each episode being based on a different video game. You got Mega Man, Sifu, God of War... and Concord.\n\nNo fucking way, are they doing a Concord episode? Man that is so damn funny.\n\nSony have absolutely thrown the kitchen sink at this game because they seemed convinced that it was going to spawn a gigantic multimedia franchise. They just forgot to make a game that people actually wanted to play as part of that.\n\nFor how experienced Sony is in the games business, I still can’t believe they thought this game would be that big\n\nThey were so confident with this game man it's hilarious\n\n[removed]\n\nAmazon's series \"Secret Level\", where each episode is based on a game.  Yeah, Concord is seriously an episode.\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/08/21/a-list-of-every-game-featured-in-amazons-promising-secret-level-show/\n\nDamn they put concord next to all timers like DnD and unreal tournament before it even launched.\n\nWow this game may go down as the biggest failure in video game history...\n\nOr the quickest! 😆\n\nThis is why the gaming industry needs to pivot back to offline games. It’s overly Saturated with live service grinding lootbox battle pass bullshit that’s all copy and pasted.\n\nYup, I don't know what the shareholders were thinking but I'm glad this game flopped. Who's moronic idea was it to slap a $40 price tag on another generic PvP hero shooter in a market that is oversatured with games like it and a playerbase that is getting tired of them?\n\nThis game didn't crash and burn, it just fell flat. Concord appeared out of nowhere with next to no marketing, nobody played it, and it's gone. I genuinely hope this will be a warning to developers that the market is getting tired of live service games and the endless FOMO of battlepass' and overpriced skins. We want something fresh and new, not yet another live service PvP hero shooter.\n\nA game that took 8 YEARS to make failed in the matter of 15 days lmao. I've never seen a retail game go bye bye so fast in my life. \n\nWhy even make a press release lol\n\nJust DM the 4 that still play\n\nMake a Groupchat with them lmao\n\nWait what? Already?\n\nOn steam. The 24 hour peak player count right now is 110. And the all time high is 697 on launch...\n\nThis post has more concurrent viewers than this game has of players...\n\nWhy’s that poster look like a Guardians of the Galaxy game that temu makes.\n\nBecause that’s what the game is. If you didn’t see it at the time watch the pre launch “movie”, it’s not subtle.\n\nWHAT thats... something. Very quick too.\n\nHoly fuck this is incredible. In the future, when you see someone damage controlling a GaaS game, don't even bother reminding them of Anthem, Avengers, Suicide Squad, etc. Just name Concord lmao.\n\n-A new Live-Service game trailer is revealed\n\n-A bunch of people say it'll be a failure\n\n-Those people get called bad names by the devs and fans\n\n-The game release, it's a failure\n\n-Devs call people even more bad names\n\n-Devs get fired \n\n-The 10 players say the next update will save the game\n\n-Game and studio gets shutdown \n\n-The people that said it would be a success disappear, never to be seen again\n\n-Repeat\n\nThis time was faster, and they even skipped some steps.\n\nI still can’t believe they called that big lad “Starchild”.\n\nwhelp thats the way the cookie crumbles\n\nBet the executives still get their bonus check at the end of the year.\n\nThis soulless trend chasing slop deserved to fail"

That's why I manually masturbate caged animals for artificial insemination.\n\nI'm sorry you lost your dream job, but video games are a perfectly acceptable plan B.\n\nWe used to create \"Mario\" levels (this was around when Mario 3 came out). And we taped the levels together. The rule was that you had to explain how you could get through the level. We always added a lot of tanks from the Dark World levels though. I think I may still have some of them in a box in the attic haha...\n\nDid you ever try Mario Maker?\n\nSame! I thought it was a neurodivergent thing, but I see there desperation is real for a lot of us lol\n\nCan it run Doom?\n\nWe are going to get doom running on a water atom at some point mark my words\n\nI‘d be more impressed about the water atom.\n\nIt's like a water molecule, just smaller. Duh...\n\nWhat a level chemistry does to a person😭\n\nYou’re really on to something here. We could save so much Hs and 2s and Os!\n\nRemindMe! 55 years\n\nYeah okay buddy.\n\n*RemindMeNextWeek\n\nI remember some scientests managed to run doom with bacteria.\n\nYep just google it \n\"An MIT biotech researcher has been able to run the iconic computer game Doom using actual gut bacteria.\"\n\nMost extreme \"can run Doom\" things are just displays and the \"running\" part is done by something far more mundane. Doom was not friendly towards the tech of it's time - like it could not run properly on 16 bit consoles.\n\nPeople forget (or more likely never knew) that \"can it run DOOM\" started out as an extremely legitimate question.\n\nit was the original but can it run Crysis, but it turned around with tech progression in a funny way.\n\nIf you can draw it, it can run it.\n\nGonna see the Skyrim intro again...\n\n[deleted]\n\nThis had me checking half-way through whether I was falling for a shittymorph...\n\nHope things got better for you, man!\n\nit's like a crackhead trying to get a hit by snorting the carpet dust from under the table\n\n can relate\n\n[deleted]\n\n[deleted]\n\nThey gave you a game but they gave you a console a few *years* later?????? Did they ask you \"why aren't you playing the game\"?\n\nOkay, it's 1993 and the lack of the Internet made it difficult to do research.\n\nBack in those days, video gaming was not what it is today.  It was still a niche market that some people even called a fad.\n\nAlso, without the internet, you didn’t have information on anything except what you happen to see on TV.\n\nI’m being serious:  there were a lot of parents that didn’t even know you needed a system to play it.  When they found out, they probably couldn’t afford it.\n\nAw this is quite sad but sweet. I hope you got to heal your inner child as an adult by buying and playing the games you want.\n\nlol I had the opposite problem. My uncle gave me a gameboy color but I didn't have any games for it and I can't borrow any from kids I know because they're also poor af, so it ended up being sold by my dad to buy meth or something.\n\nI don’t ask this to be mean, what’s the context? Getting a game but no console? Was it like a family member who thought you had one so they only got the game or maybe a member who didn’t understand the concept of a video game and didn’t know you needed a system to play the game on? I hope you have all the consoles to play all the games nowadays\n\nGot that C-button action!\n\nScrolled WAY too far to see any mention of the C button lol\n\nThe c-button adds 15 horsepower\n\nThe desperation!\n\nYes, restricted gaming time was tough\n\nThat reminds me when I was a kid. With my brothers, we used to play a crapton of Warcraft 2 when it got released. But we couldn't get enough of it due to restricted access to games on our family computer. Since those rules only included games, we created a mixtape using Warcraft 2 soundboard and created our own IRL Warcraft scenarios. It went as far as walking from my bedroom to the fireplace holding a small plastic axe, hitting a log 50 times (we counted how many hits it took in the game for a peon to bring back wood). Good memories ❤️\n\nIts wild to see this because my son does the same thing when he's not allowed on his Switch. He'll make them out of paper, Legos, Snap Circuits,..anything! He'll design his levels and pretend to play them until he gets more time on his actual console.\n\nHow did we survive\n\nGaming at your cousins'\n\nCareful, Nintendo might sue you\n\nMight?\n\nI can do this all day, Nintendo!\n\nCame here for this. But, let me correct you. Nintendo will* sue him. \n\nThis is cool!\n\ncool! I used to sketch level designs on paper as well and took them to school. Once my teacher found them during class and ripped them apart 😢\n\nMan... fuck people like that.\n\nThis is slick!\n\nMom, I want a Gameboy.\n\nWe have Gameboy at home!\n\nI love this creativity.  What do you do for a living now?\n\nThanks! I've stuck with it. I founded a small studio with a friend to work on a game since two years now.\n\nLet us all know when we can wishlist your game.\n\nAre you a game Dev now or an artist of some kind(even if not for work?) because this is pretty awesome! :)\n\nThanks! Yes, a friend and I have been working full-time on a game for two years now :)\n\nAwesome! I wish that was me. My \"best friend\" since I was 5 and I have always coded games and been artistic but any time I ask him if he wants to make a game together he always says \"No I want to make my own game\" and then proceeds to not work on any game.\n\nI hope Nintendos president Shuntaro Furukawa will personally deliver your seize and desist letter\n\n*cease\n\nI refuse to accept this information\n\nPaco Gutierrez, age 9, always wanted a Nintendo console. However, due to being extremely poor living in Venezuela, it was just a distant dream. Using his creativity and with the help from his uncle, he made a cardboard Super Mario game, posted it on YouTube and the video went viral. Thanks to the video, Nintendo’s CEO Doug Bowser personally traveled to Venezuela, to give Paco a Cease and Desist order and sue his family for 200 million dollars.\n\nDoug Bowser: \"A Nintendo Console does not cost much. If your parents did not want you to get sued, they should have gotten you a Nintendo Console.\"\n\nCame looking for exactly this ... was not disappointed.\n\nNintendo 's lawyer will like to have a word with you./s\n\nI once drew the entire SMB 1-1 with every hidden something\n\nYou were really a talented kid OP. Can I ask you what do you do for a living now ?\n\nThank you! I still make games and have been doing it for a living since two years now. I hope our current game succeeds, so I'm able to continue for another one.\n\nThat's really cool to hear! I'm in my late 30s and just now getting into game development after years of tinkering here and there in Game Maker and such. I've finally landed in Godot and I'm about 6 months into tutorials/making clones of classic games for practice. I hope to be releasing something of my own one day!\n\nMan I did this too!  \nThough I build a GBA that had pinball controls on the side and the pinball board was pluggable like a cardridge. It was functional :D\n\nEDIT: and it looks like its the same red cardboard!\n\nahh.. ur parents didn’t get you a game boy as well\n\nI did the exact same thing as a kid! Amazing!\n\ncareful nintendo ninjas didn't sleep\n\nnintendo located already your adress and sends its lawyers\n\nDamn, you added a C button? Gonna put Nintendo to shame at this rate with such advanced technology\n\nDoes it have a port of Skyrim?\n\nPeak gaming. You can’t change my mind.\n\nYou were a level designer as a kid. Nice!\n\nAdd a potato, and run doom on it.\n\nGod I love this, reminds me of the shit I used to draw and make when I was younger. You could be making so many levels and have so much fun!\n\nI had an old glasses case which I filled with different drawings about imaginary websites that I drew for real brands and companies. When I opened the case it was almost like a Nokia Communicator with web access. This was somewhere around end of the 90's.\n\nWould be super fun to find those somewhere again.\n\nreally cool I used to make shit like this all the time\n\nA Gameboy Advanced SP. (kinda)\n\n\n\nGod, I haven't seen one for a long time.\nSo much Pokemon Emerald on the go.\n\n\nGood memories.\n\nSave it for new generations' museum\n\nOMG I DID THE SAME THING 😂I wanted it so so bad.\n\nGiven that you did this on graph paper and kept to 'tiles' - it would actually be quite trivial to turn your hand-drawn artwork into an actual game.\n\nSend in the nintendo lawyers\n\nYes, I too was poor\n\nMeanwhile Nintendo lawyers looking at this sub to sue people\n\nGet ready for a lawsuit from Nintendo\n\nI assume Nintendo sued you and garnished you're allowance till you were 18?\n\nIf I had gold, I'd gave it to you but I don't. So have this instead\n\n⠀         ⣤⣶⣶⡶⠦⠴⠶⠶⠶⠶⡶⠶⠦⠶⠶⠶⠶⠶⠶⠶⣄⠀⠀⠀⠀  \n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣿⣀⣀⣀⣀⠀⢀⣤⠄⠀⠀⣶⢤⣄⠀⠀⠀⣤⣤⣄⣿⠀⠀⠀⠀  \n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡷⠋⠁⠀⠀⠀⠙⠢⠙⠻⣿⡿⠿⠿⠫⠋⠀⠀⠀⠀  \n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⣤⠞⠉⠀⠀⠀⠀⣴⣶⣄⠀⠀⠀⢀⣕⠦⣀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀  \n⠀⠀⠀⢀⣤⠾⠋⠁⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⣼⣿⠟⢿⣆⠀⢠⡟⠉⠉⠊⠳⢤⣀⠀⠀⠀  \n⠀⣠⡾⠛⠁⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⣀⣾⣿⠃⠀⡀⠹⣧⣘⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠉⠳⢤⡀  \n⠀⣿⡀⠀⠀⢠⣶⣶⣿⣿⣿⣿⡿⠁⠀⣼⠃⠀⢹⣿⣿⣿⣶⣶⣤⠀⠀⠀⢰⣷  \n⠀⢿⣇⠀⠀⠈⠻⡟⠛⠋⠉⠉⠀⠀⡼⠃⠀⢠⣿⠋⠉⠉⠛⠛⠋⠀⢀⢀⣿⡏  \n⠀⠘⣿⡄⠀⠀⠀⠈⠢⡀⠀⠀⠀⡼⠁⠀⢠⣿⠇⠀⠀⡀⠀⠀⠀⠀⡜⣼⡿⠀  \n⠀⠀⢻⣷⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢸⡄⠀⢰⠃⠀⠀⣾⡟⠀⠀⠸⡇⠀⠀⠀⢰⢧⣿⠃⠀  \n⠀⠀⠘⣿⣇⠀⠀⠀⠀⣿⠇⠀⠇⠀⠀⣼⠟⠀⠀⠀⠀⣇⠀⠀⢀⡟⣾⡟⠀⠀  \n⠀⠀⠀⢹⣿⡄⠀⠀⠀⣿⠀⣀⣠⠴⠚⠛⠶⣤⣀⠀⠀⢻⠀⢀⡾⣹⣿⠃⠀⠀  \n⠀⠀⠀⠀⢿⣷⠀⠀⠀⠙⠊⠁⠀⢠⡆⠀⠀⠀⠉⠛⠓⠋⠀⠸⢣⣿⠏⠀⠀⠀  \n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠘⣿⣷⣦⣤⣤⣄⣀⣀⣿⣤⣤⣤⣤⣤⣄⣀⣀⣀⣀⣾⡟⠀⠀⠀⠀  \n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢹⣿⣿⣿⣻⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠁⠀⠀⠀⠀\n\nCool shit men !\n\nI used to do this too!! The memories….\n\nadorable, i want to hug it\n\nOp was just a kid, but he already understood that two face buttons weren't enough to work with\n\nNice!! I’m glad I’m not the only one. I made the PET from  Megaman and the cards. Good times\n\nMake sure you remove the battery if you’re going to store it for a long time\n\nThat's so creative!\n\nI did this as well but not with side scroller levels/games.\n\nBut in my case, every time you switched a game cartridge you got a new screen on your \"display\".\n\nI Also made a cellphone similar to your game boy with an extendable drinking straw as antenna.\n\nCease and desist incoming\n\nNintendo Lawyer: You shouldn't have posted that.\n\nso cute!\n\nA C button instead of Start and Select? Sorry, man, this is a bootleg.\n\nHoly FUCK you were bored!\n\n#i love it\n\nI love this so much. Super creative and reminds me of the doodles I'd make as a kid.\n\nI did this as well, lol. When I was a kid I really wanted a game boy but we couldn't afford one, so I made one out of paper. It didn't have side-scrolling, my levels were usually all on a single screen, and I could pull the screens out and slot them in like cartridges.\n\nI also went bonkers with making games for it. I had platformers, but I also made some games in the sierra adventure type, more combat focused platformers, and a bunch of totally experimental games that my kid mind thought of.\n\nAt first all of my games were in black and white, but then Game Boy Color released IRL and I was like OHH SHIT I COULD COLOR THEM TOO! And I made a new version of the paper gameboy and started making colored game cartridges.\n\nI would try to share it with kids at school and let them play my games but they didn't get it, lol. It took a lot of imagination to play through a level.\n\nSo, now you're an engineer?\n\nI'm gonna use this as an example of paper prototyping for my CS class :) Looks awesome\n\nAmazing, I love it\n\nWatch out Nintendo may sue you!\n\nLook out Nintendo might sue\n\n\"No - We have GameBoy at home!\"\n\nI used graph paper to design SimCity cities while I was camping in the wilderness with my grandparents.\n\nsick! amazing that you had so much creativity lol\n\nTell me you grew up poor, without telling me..\nMy mom used to make me sandwiches with margarine and sugar.\n\nThis is so creative!\n\nHonestly really well done.\n\ngame boy in the hood\n\nI hope your parents bought you a Gameboy after seeing that.\n\nThat's so creative. Ohhh to be to be a kid again :-(\n\nI miss having that childlike imagination\n\nReminds me of the P-P-P-PowerBook!\n\nI literally used to do this. This looks better then the ones that I made. Thanks for the nostalgia trip!!\n\nQuick! Hide that post! We don't want you to be sued by Nintendo\n\nWow this is so cool! I wonder what major you ended up going into. An art related field?\n\nIf you're even vaguely interested in coding you should try and create an actual game with those levels. There are some great tutorials on YouTube for platform games with Unity etc. Then in the end credits put those photos in there.\n\nBoredom is the birth of creativity\n\nhah i did the same thing but playing the game kinda sucked, also the devs could've pushed new content a bit quicker\n\nYooo! We riding on the nostalgia train now. Me n my friend made such stuff in 4th n 5th grade for like 20 cents for the console and 5 or something for the games. Aah good shit fr🥹. We'd have a party at the school canteen every few days when we did that(yeh cuz u can't take that kinda money home dawg. We felt like millionaires)\n\nI did the same thing when I was little but it was a DS! I’d cut out screenshots from Game Informer or print them from the internet to put inside the cardboard system and imagine the gameplay.\n\nMy daughter makes stuff like this all the time. She's done a smart phone and laptop so far and made all the different \"scenes\" for the screen just as you did!\n\nGame Boy Advance SP (Super Paper)\n\nBro had a limited edition Gameboy with not just A and B buttons but the rare C button too. Wow\n\nNintendo will find you and sue you.\n\n“What is this feeling I’m feeling right now? It’s like I’m sad, for another person? Is that a thing? AM I GOING CRAZY?!”\n\nDude that looks incredible, it looks like even at such an age, you wanted to make video Games, love it!\n\n***Nintendo would like to know your location***\n\nI used to create a cardboard laptop to pretend I was \"working\"! Next minute my real laptop is glued to me lol!\n\nI did that but I made a macbook\n\nYesterday my daughter made me a tamagotchi out of cardboard and made a couple different pets too.\n\nyou better keep that! i wish i kept mine...\n\nThis is hella cute.\n\nNintendo about to send this man a legal letter for illegal reproduction of games\n\nNintendo is gonna put you in a blender for that\n\nGood luck dealing with the latest Nintendo litigation\n\nThis is a really cute project! I took me a second to notice you pull the level across the screen to keep playing! That’s so creative I love it!"

    "all_comment_text": "Isn’t this the guy that added micro-transactions to vehicles? Can we start the boycott now?\n\nI forgot he did that. And his fucking Cybertruck is more dangerous to the occupant than the outside.\n\nThat's a very unfair statement.  It's so dangerous to the outside that some insurance companies won't insure it due to how much damage it can create for other cars in even very minor accidents.\n\nAs someone who drives a Mazda 3 daily, the Cybertruck fucking terrifies me. I’m pretty sure I would just instantly die if one crashed into me.\n\nI have a small hatchback and this guy a couple houses down drives his cybertruck like he’s in a fucking car chase. Which is really fun at night because he has the all blacked out version and him tearing around the neighborhood is just blinding lights suddenly appearing around a sharp turn\n\nOh no I tripped and my sack of nails fell all over the road 😔\n\nMy caltrop collection!\n\n\n...Oh no!\n\nNah, if it hits something hard like a brick wall or another cybertruck it will turn the occupants into a fine red paste.\n\nAll that energy that goes into crushing the crumple zone of a safe car. Yeah, that goes into your soft gooey organs in a cybertruck.\n\nHow did this get NHTSA approval?\n\nI heard a quote relating to the wing mirrors.\n\n\"We tried to use cameras in the place of wing mirros, but we couldn't get the NRSS rules changed for that.\"\n\nI think that explains it.\n\nIf his games are anything like the cyber truck it'll need about 10 patches to be functional after launch.\n\n\nI can only imagine the wild things he d promise in game as well pre launch\n\nThose are not micro.\n\nMy mom says they're a perfectly normal size\n\nPress X doubt.\n\nHe's gonna make the very first XXX game...oh wait...\n\nTracy Jordan did it first!\n\nHe was truly a wise man. Lived every week like it was shark week\n\nWith Vin Diesel?\n\nThankfully Xenoblade Chronicles X is taken\n\nPress &lt;jumping_elon.jpg&gt; to doubt.\n\nPress Twitter to doubt (I refuse to call it X)\n\nI haven't updated the app so it's still called twitter for me. Even the splash screen is still of that blue bird\n\ncrowd uppity scale literate party numerous afterthought reply heavy dime\n\nI don't get it either. He acts like he is a man of the people, but he is the richest man on the planet. It's weird.\n\nHe's trying to copy Trump's \"man of the people\" bullshit.\n\nexcept he actually IS rich...\n\nThat's the scary part.  He's half way competent when his ego gets out of the way.\n\nCalling him Half way competent is generous\n\nHe's a competent marketer but that's about it. And I'm not even sure why his brand of marketing works but it seems to\n\n&gt; I'm not even sure why his brand of marketing works\n\nIts simple\n\n&gt; \"Wow. Rich guy gets to be an asshole to people I hate. I will support him so when I am a rich guy I can be an asshole too!\"\n\nThis is **exactly** the thinking for most of the plebs who choose to support him and Trump.\n\nTemporarily embarrased millionaires who think the ladder will not be pulled up before they get there.\n\nYeah, I find it kinda hard to believe the american anti-billionaire sentiment when lots of them start sucking billionaires off when they have similar political opinions.\n\nThey aren’t anti billionaire. At least not the conservatives. They are pro billionaire and anti-whoever is against them regardless of wealth\n\nYou can tell that by their actions, but the rhetoric will always be against big companies, although curiously the targets will always be jewish and/or liberal\n\nThat's it. They don't actually give a fuck about large companies, they just say the word large companies as code for \"businesses who explicitly cater to the kinds of  Americans i hate instead of me and the Americans i like\". They try to pass it off as a criticism exchanging quality for representation or some general anti-corproate sentiment. Underneath it's just racism/anti-progressive/homophobic panic - they will explicitly find ways to excuse companies they believe are politically aligned with them.\n\nIts not hard to understand. Reddit used to love Elon and thought he was \"one of the good ones\" until he showed his ass.\n\nThe question here is how long it will take them to understand that they've been played.\n\nTbf before he crashed out he was kind of a steve jobs/bill gates type tech guy that social media nerds usually like, but nowadays he opted to just move completely away from that to become a politics influencer or whatever. Kind of changed his target audience in a way.\n\nHe was always a douchbag but when he got rid off his PR team holding him back talking shit, it became clear to see\n\nI think if we're being fair he did objectively change at some point. The ego was always there, in fact I remember people regularly joking that he was Lex Luthor in waiting. \n\nBut he did used to have some progressive ideals. His stated vision for Tesla was bring back American car manufacturing while reducing climate impact of vehicles. In a way it's the pragmatic progressive ideal, because it's always been odd to me that the oil barrons weren't getting out in front of green energy just in case it took off. He did do that. In fact, Tesla is maybe *the* shining star of the Green New Deal concept. Government propped it up until it was sustainable on its own. And then he completely turned on it. He was also supportive of gay rights and open to trans at one time.\n\nNot sure if it was the submarine thing or if he was always just pandering and the wind changed and took him with it, but he felt \"demonized\" by the left in part because there are liberal purity tests. Maybe the grift just became too alluring. But he 100% changed from scientifically sound utopian ideals to all day alt right grift.\n\nThey aren't against oppression so long as it targets people they don't like.\n\nHe is the richest man on the planet because a shit ton of people keep believing all of the bullshit he says. *So why stop there ?*\n\nHe also got most of his money because he won government contracts. Elon is the real welfare queen.\n\nHe certainly fits the stereotype they invented.\n\n1. African-American ✔️\n2. Tons of Children with multiple parents ✔️\n3. Doesn't do any work. ✔️\n4. Collects government check ✔️\n\nIt's the classic formula for success: rich parents and government welfare.\n\nBecause he doesn't want to be eaten when shit hits the fan\n\nI’ll make sure to eat Elon Musk first.\n\n[removed]\n\nThink of all the pretty colors he will burn!\n\nCan I at least inhale the smoke?\n\nI'm going to say yes, the smoke is probably less toxic than direct consumption.\n\nHe grew up with a silver spoon in his mouth but tries to effectively make out that he is a fully self-made man. He claims he is a \"free-speech absolutist\" and yet blatantly tries to clamp down on coverage that is critical of him.\n\nHe is a man who suddenly switched from being negative on Trump to being extremely positive, and nets a government position which could allow him the ability to reduce pesky regulations affecting his businesses.\n\nHe pretends to be a man of the people so he can get a cult following whom he can make use of in different ways. \n\nIt's not weird; it's just manipulation.\n\nBecause if he acted like the parasitic, sociopathic, trust fund kid he is, he wouldn't be able to assuage his highschool trauma by convincing himself he's the popular kid.\n\nIt’s like having the world’s biggest tryhard sitting in your lobby, only you cant mute them because they are in every channel.\n\nborn into one pf the richer families of south africa, raised in mansions and never wanting for anything.\nuntil he one day, with daddies money ofc, buys into enough successful companies to call himself a self-made man.\ntruly an rags to rich story.\n\nIt's just a shame he couldn't buy a better personality. Dude's the shittiest version of a nerdy rich kid.\n\nJust yesterday some guest on FOX (or maybe it was FOX Business), in response to a remark that Trump and Musk have their detractors, trotted out the old chestnut that people are just jealous because they are \"self-made men\" that through their wit and acumen raised themselves from nothing (or at least humble middle class roots) to becoming the most wealthy and powerful men in the world.\n\nI just have to wonder if these people are really that ignorant as to the origins of these men or otherwise, what they get out of lying through their teeth with this false narrative.\n\nWhat's weird is how many idiots fall for it\n\nWell not the richest man on the planet but the richest man who has to disclose his income . There are many people in the middle east who are probably worth trillions, but they dont need to disclose their income\n\nEdit: this includes net worth including stocks\n\nPutin is said to have personal wealth into the trillions, thanks to kickbacks from oligarchs and other shady deals. In terms of controllable wealth, he certainly has that much.\n\nI mean .. look how many people voted for Trump because they think the democrats are too elitist\n\nThey just keep targeting dumb people and they fall for it hook, line and sinker.\n\nIt's because they've successfully managed to convert the political meaning of 'elites' over the years. They used to call them ivory tower elites because it was supposed to mean really rich people. 'You can't trust them, they're too out of touch to understand the real world!'\n\nBut over time (really since Nixon) they started using it to mean highly educated people from liberal states. The sort of people who are experts in various fields. e.g. the people who kept telling them that their various ideas were stupid or would speak out about how things like mass deregulation would actually hurt average families etc. \n\nSo they turned it into straight anti-intellectualism, 'you can't trust them, they think they're so smart with all their degrees, they don't know how the real world works!!' \n\nWhich has the desired effect of allowing super rich people to somehow slip out of the classification of 'elites' while being Scrooge McDuck level wealthy, while a climate scientist in California trying to warn people about global warming is the enemy of the people.\n\nMaybe I'm brainwashed, but isn't Tesla notorious for having the same unrealistic deadline and work hours that the mainstream video games industry mostly does? This should go over well\n\nJoe Rogan have like 10 times the viewers that news TV does, but he's apparently not mainstream media\n\nFox News is the most watched “news channel” in America, but they aren’t mainstream media. \n\nSinclair owns hundreds of local news stations across the country, but it’s not mainstream media. \n\nIt’s almost like they are lying to us and manipulating stupid people to vote against their own interest. \n\nI’m so sick and tired of right wing politics regressing my country into Idiocracy. \n\nAmerica has so much potential. So much fucking wasted potential.\n\nManufacturing consent.\n\nRight-wingers are compulsive liars.\n\nThere is a generational schism between the broadcast and internet culture. Idk why not many talk about it. It's noticable in many different layers of society.\n\nThat schism does not make him any less mainstream.\n\nHe is doing the \"How do you do, fellow kids\" meme in real life and a whole bunch of people are just eating it up.\n\nSame reason Fox News complains about mainstream media despite being the most watched network.\n\nthe same reason he pretends he's not part of the \"elite\" despite being the richest man in the world and having his own agency in the Trump admnistration\n\nBecause his followers belive what he says even when its obviously a lie\n\nBecause there seems to be a weird fanbase around him that believes the stupid crap he feeds them.\n\nUsually they're the same people who think Russia is 'liberating' Ukraine from Nazis.\n\nLike when fox news complains about \"the mainstream media\" as though they are not the very definition of that.\n\n[deleted]\n\nThat douch is the absolute worst! Hank sr. And Waylon would be turning in their graves if they knew what country has turned into\n\nRIP Kris Kristofferson, a real one\n\nI'm pissed pissedofferson.\n\nThat one hurt. Alot of history with that guy.\n\n&gt;what country has turned into\n\nThere's good modern country being made. It's just not being made by Jason Aldean. You may have to look harder and sift through more shit to find it, but there *is* good country music still being created. \n\nLike all music, the enshittification of the most advertised stuff doesn't preclude good stuff from getting made, though it makes it harder to find.\n\nThat’s a good point! I’m sure if you look deep enough there’s still some good stuff being made. I heard some good stuff from  a guy named sturgill simpson and was quite impressed\n\nSturgill, Charley Crockett, Ian Munswick, Zach Bryan, Kasey Musgraves, Miranda Lambert . . . Etc. Some are new, some have been around a while but are still making and releasing new music . . . And these are who I would still consider \"country\" and not necessarily \"folk\" or alternative, though Crockett is probably more of an \"outlaw\" or something other than \"mainstream Nashville pop country.\"\n\n[deleted]\n\nTyler Childers\n\nMetal as a genre is in a similar state. Like country, more people than ever are making it, which means they're more garbage you have to sort through before you find anything original or technically talented. It's there you just have to work for it.\n\nPeople complaining about \"the elites\" and then voting for the party of the elites run by literal unelected billionaires.\n\nPeople are sick of career politicians, so they vote for the business guy who is not a career politician... turns the country into an oligarchy...\n\nSick of career politicians so they vote for the guy who pays off the career politicians galaxy brain move\n\nIt's not about reality for those people, it's about optics.\n\nIt doesn't matter what Trump does behind the scenes, all that matters is what he does publicly. And you'll notice that those pay-offs happen behind closed doors while publicly he goes on &amp; on about how career politicians have ruined the country by allowing libs to have too much freedom and how a vote for him is going to restore America to the golden years of the post-WWII economic boom (even if that's not possible because our economy was only so strong because Europe was rebuilding from 2 massive wars &amp; had to pay the US for the supplies, thus artificially inflating the US's economy independent of anything American workers were actually doing).\n\nConservatives have increasingly managed to link the “elites” with academics, NGOs and liberal do-gooders.\n\nAnd multimillionaires - as long as you don't recognize any particular level of education -as being close to the people - no matter how obviously they rip people off.\n\nPerhaps it's made easier by the fact that nobody can really imagine how rich Musk is, how he lives, etc... While most people probably know some academic snob who thinks he's better now that he's gone to university. But it is extremely dangerous and super-frustrating that everyone who still has influence - without being directly linked to the financial elite - is increasingly being successfully declared the enemy.\n\nPeople are complaining about the elites, after propaganda spread by the elites have convinced them the elites aren't the elites and to vote for the elites run by a elitist elite.\n\nI always found MAGA portraying themselves as the underdogs as very perplexing.\n\n\"Mainstream media is owned by the libs and they're unfair to Trump!\"\n\n1. Fox News has been the top cable news station for a long time and continues to be; and it has always been anti-liberal. They also talk about Trump as if he's god himself.\n2. CNN has been moving further and further conservative to the point they were partaking in the act of sane-washing Trump in the lead up to the 2024 election.\n3. Patrick Soon-Shiong (owner of the LA Times) and Jeff Bezos (owner of the Washington Times) stopped their editorial staff from endorsing Kamala Harris under the disguise of just not endorsing either candidate. They really wanted to endorse Trump, but that would probably cause an even bigger uproar among their staff.\n4. Twitter, one of the largest social networks in the entire world, was bought out by a petulant man-child who has turned it into an absolute circus of far right hatred.\n5. Joe Rogan, who is basically the mainstream media at this point, interviewed both Trump and Vance and gave Trump a glowing endorsement afterwards. - EDIT: FOR ANY FUTURE REPLIES - I KNOW HARRIS WAS INVITED ON HIS SHOW. THIS WAS JUST TO POINT OUT HOW THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA TREATS TRUMP NICELY EVEN THOUGH HE AND HIS BASE CLAIM OTHERWISE. THE ONLY TIME I EVEN MENTIONED KAMALA HARRIS BEING TREATED UNFAIRLY WAS FOX NEWS BEING ANTI-LIBERAL.\n\nRemind me again how Trump was a victim of the mainstream media? Because it seems to me like the mainstream media treated him quite nicely.\n\n[deleted]\n\nAll of these media outlets and talking heads backed by either the same couple billionaires or literally money laundered from Russia:\n\n* The Daily Wire\n\n* Prager U\n\n* Ben Shapiro\n\n* Dennis Prager\n\n* Jordan Peterson\n\n* Tim Pool\n\n* Candace Owens\n\n* Benny Johnson\n\n* Michael Knowles\n\n* Dave Rubin\n\n* Matt Walsh\n\n* \"How Do You Do, Fellow Streamers,\" Brett Cooper\n\nAnd that's... just from my memory, off the top of my head.\n\nAnd that's just, like, the Wilks brothers and Tenet Media (Oh! Lauren Chen, duh... add her to the pile)... that doesn't account for *all* the others just oversaturating every available space with bullshit.\n\nIt's also a staple of evangelical Christianity. They love to act like it's 10AD and they're hiding from Roman persecution despite basically the religion with the most power in world affairs.\n\nThey know keeping their flock panicked and controlled is the only means for survival at this point. \n\n[deleted]\n\nPretty simple, they lie and it works. They dominated this election as a result.\n\nIt was funny hearing him and them complain about how unfair the MSM treated him, which I only heard through the MSM and their willingness to give him endless free publicity. \n\n\\&gt;I always found MAGA portraying themselves as the underdogs as very perplexing.\n\nIt has nothing to do with them being actual underdogs of course, it´s just an act to get poor and uneducated people to identify with and vote for them.\n\n[deleted]\n\nMy husband subscribed to the NYT and even THEY do this.\n\nBiden would get one word wrong in a speech and they’d make it front page news for a week. Trump would spend 40 minutes dancing to Ave Maria during an event and they barely mention it.\n\nThe sanewashing they did for him was bizarre.\n\nPersecution complex is a helluva drug. It works on the uneducated easily.\n\nThey know their base is stupid enough to believe it anyway.\n\nthey know their voters/cultists. Reality doesnt matter. Regardless, I hope this venture loses him as much money as twitter.\n\n“We are the #1 new network, America’s most trusted… and also somehow not mainstream”\n\nThey'll bitch about \"the mainstream media doesn't show this\" then cut to their outro saying they're Americas most watched network. And those idiots fall for it\n\nAnother day, another Elon quote about \"cost cutting\" in something he knows absolutely zero about.\n\nMan famous for forcing employees to work endlessly until they burnout enters industry famous for forcing employees to work endlessly until they burnout.\n\n\nI bet his solution is to force employees to work even *more* endlessly until they burnout.\n\nI suspect he's going to want to turn over a lot of things to AI not realizing the glaring issues with that\n\nHe'll make a game that is 95% built by AI, then be surprised when other companies sue him\n\nBro is in the business of making badly made electric cars and hoping something sticks. He definitely will adopt AI fully without care for the consequences.\n\nnah, he's gonna go big into AI.\nAi made games are the future, don't you know?\n\nI wish the official Reddit app would let me block keywords. I’m so tired of seeing posts about Elon.\n\nSame, my first instinct was to downvote the post cuz I just do not care. \"Elon Musk Says\" should not be a headline\n\nPreach. It's sorely needed.\n\nI miss apollo. It was so much better.\n\nHey, you can shut right up! Just have to take a look at the $39,900 cybertruck that was discussed in 2019. Only a cost\nCutting genius could deliver the cybertruck for that value!\n\n\n/s\n\nThe man has a storied past of being behind schedule, way over promised price and way below promised features. Yet here we are.\n\nFull self driving next year.  We super duper double-dog promise this time.\n\nCan this guy just fuckin go to mars already. I’m so sick of reading about his bullshit drug fueled ideas on how to make the world worse for everyone but him.\n\nI'd rather see him burn billions on making video games than withering nations with his dumbass egomaniac ideas on how government and business should work to benefit him.\n\n\nBut he'll manage to be terrible with both somehow.\n\nI agree, but I just know he’s going to come after Steam at some point which sucks.\n\nGood thing Steam is privately owned. \n\nHe and others in the incoming administration keep going on about changing regulation and using the justice department for their own ends. If he wants to fuck with Steam he’ll just change the laws, throttle their internet, give their competitors contracts or passes. He could make unreasonable requests about data hosting or punish them for hosting NSFW games under ‘protecting the children’, the possibilities are endless. My only hope is that he and Trump have a falling out before he gets his hands on the levers or that he’s too incompetent to use the levers.\n\nThere are other countries (a lot of other countries) that would offer everything to have steam move their hq in them.\n\nCanada comes to mind. I bet Gaben would be fine with a nice Vancouver Office. Or sweden, they already have some good game companys.\n\nSteam Montreal would be peak as hell\n\nIf he can't buy it, he'll disparage it and make his minions all run to his new \"totally not a steam ripoff\" client.\n\n\nAt least GoG built something useful lol\n\nIf his cult wants to leave steam that's good, might get some sensible reviews.\n\nThat's perfectly fine. Steam's been comfortable whoever comes and goes. It's not a business model that Elon would understand nor replicate. Hell, he would make Epic, EA, and Microsoft look good by comparison.\n\nHe might just buy Ubisoft and fuck it up beyond recognition like what he did with Twitter.\n\nUbisoft can’t get much worse to be fair.\n\nWe said the same about twitter\n\nThe guy that owns like 4 giant corporations is going to beat the giant corporations\n\n# [...] using AI.\n\nHIGH RED FLAG\n\n&gt;*Elon Musk says*\n\nIt's not like you really need to add any more red flags whenever a sentence start with that\n\nCan't wait to not buy any of his games\n\nHe will then sue you :P\n\nHe’s gonna U2 you! You’ll wake up and have all of them downloaded.\n\nNot buying his games is against free speech!\n\n[deleted]\n\n\"Chess has a tiny number of degrees of freedom compared to reality,\" he wrote. \"Only 64 squares, no fog of war, no tech tree, no terrain differences, same starting pieces &amp; positions every time and you can't invent new pieces during the game.\"\n\nAbsolute fuck-knuckle\n\nThere technically is a tech tree if you get your pawn across the board free queen\n\nAnd very rarely, free knight.\n\nso you're saying he's making chess 2\n\n\"U-um, we a-are hard at wor-work, putting the first-first d-demo out for C-Cyberchess-\"\n\nWhat the title fails to mention is that it's going to be an AI game studio. So he's not going to make games at all just AI generated bullshit.\n\nWhy do I have a feeling his idea of “great” is “weird about women and says slurs”\n\n[deleted]\n\nBoth sides have merit! /s\n\n“Experience the thrill of WW2 1939-43”.\n\n&gt; [Wait, I am shooting at Nazis? That's not how I remember it.](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=QlNshju1fY0) \n\n\n\\- C. Montgomery Burns\n\nbecause that is what it is going to be. Realistically he is going to use the same 'appeal' as the bad steam shovelware 'anime girl with giant boobs' garbage except instead of having the production value of 2 dudes who made it in a weekend it is going to be a AAA game with all the nuance of 4chan and the racism of... 4chan\n\nHey, Katawa Shoujo is a surprisingly deep and thoughtful game about seducing disabled girls.\n\nMusks’ studio will be lucky if it generates anything as good.\n\nActually, Katawa Shoujo was the first VN I played and I have very fond memories of it. After I had my crying session and finished all the routes I wanted to donate to the team that made it and found out that it was actually 4chan.\n\nI was very conflicted.\n\nthe developer known as 4chan..............\n\n4chan’s Nazis used to be ironic, and has never been a monolith.\n\nRememer that all those dystopian sci fi games were soulless mega-corps influence politics and exploit their workers? This time, they are the good guys, actually! Play as the fearless CEO and fight hordes of unionized employees!\n\nAh yes, the ultimate grifter. Im sure somehow he will have his new company funded with taxpayer $$\n\nMusk's modus operandi is to find something that is about to do very well and looking for an investor, then buy that up and install himself as a figurehead. Then he makes some awful decisions, forcing the company to get rid of him - either entirely or just practically out of the way. After that he is associated with the company and their brands and he can ride the coat tails of their success.\n\nIf the company succeeds, Musk's fans say it's because of him. If they fail, they say it's because they didn't listen to him.\n\nSee Muskrat's previous [x.com](http://x.com) for examples.\n\nThis is what happened with Paypal too, isn't it?\n\nWe’re going to protect you all from evil corporations by creating a bigger, better corporation that will make all other corporations irrelevant. We will be the ONLY corporation and you will like it. \n\n“And you promise to not be evil right?”\n\nYour distaste for corporate has been noted in our corporate logbooks. Remember, compliance is not optional.\n\nHe's seen what Chris Roberts' done with Star Citizen and is probably fuming he didn't come up with it first.\n\nIs he gonna od on ketamine soon? \n\n🤞\n\nThis guy is such a douche.\n\nTo think some idiots really assumed this grifter was the \"real Tony Stark\", lol what a joke, the US is the laughingstock of the planet\n\nHe’s Lex Goofer\n\nSaw a post where some guy said Tony stark was based off Elon 😭😭😭😭 making me claw my eyes out\n\nTo be frank, if he just shut up when his popularity was at an all time high and played his cards right every time he went to interviews or something. He'd be way more powerful and influential, we're lucky he's an idiot who let his narcissism and ego ruin his image.\n\n[deleted]\n\nThe living proof the government gives handouts to African-Americans!\n\nImagine starting a studio to make games great again by becoming the very thing you're critiquing\n\nIt really baffles me the attention people give this lunatic. \nStreamers talking about him, saying is now some kind of D4 god, and I’m here thinking: this is the worst case of middle life crisis I’ve ever seen.\n\nMan, i hate this timeline\n\n Blame Marty McFly. He just *had* to have that bloody Sports Almanac.\n\nDon't get it twisted, this isn't about games it's about indoctrination.\n\nImagine being the richest man in the world &amp; spending most of your time searching your own name on Twitter/X to have arguments with people.\n\nGod I hope he goes through with this.  When the games inevitably end up panned by critics and ridiculed by the gaming community it's going to shatter his fragile ego into even more little pieces.\n\nThe day this guy kicks the bucket and we never have to hear about him again is a day that I am longing for.\n\nYeah after the Twitter fuck up this isn’t really a threat, more just promising reality television, and proving the whole “rich = smart” myth wrong yet again\n\nI can't wait to mock those games when I pass them in the discount bin.\n\nI bet he's the kind of guy to get pissed off about Hephaestus being in a wheelchair in Hades II, and thinks he would do better.\n\nSo, a game studio called X, with it's first title called X, where you play a character called X and the jump button makes you do an awkward jumping jack motion.\n\nThis guy went from being a respectable dude that wanted to do things differently to one of the worst grifters of all time.\n\nAnything he is associated with, I want nothing to do with.\n\nWasn't this dickhead supposed to go to Mars? Fuck off already\n\nRemember a few years ago when we big tech was the devil and now this big tech guy is just sticking his dick in literally fucking everything and no one is blinking an eye\n\nAh yes, last time the richest man in the world tried that, it went soooo well (new world...)\n\nMore like make games shit again\n\n\"Make games great again\" as if games currently aren't great. Sure, you can point to some AAA games that are pretty dog water at times, but you can point to hundreds of great games that have come out this year or are currently being developed (be it EA or even just Kickstarter right now). The funny part is, being a big corporation owner, he'll probably make a game filled with microtransactions, always online and bad game mechanics that no one likes.\n\nHe is going to 100% copy another popular game and challenge them to sue him for it. It is what he does.\n\nElon musk is like if the dumbest person in the world got fairy god parents and just made dumb decisions.\n\n Now, where have I heard an egotistical maniac say “make _something_ great again” and in doing so make it 100x worse?\n\nTell me more about rich people telling that big companies are bad.\n\nHe's after all forms of media to control propaganda.  Dangerous idiot with too much money\n\nHe is going to create yet another company with a very creative name like \"doge style studio\" and sell water guns with the brand logo on it for 100x the price to sucker. Then never develop a single video game.\n\nCan we stop putting this clown in the news? He's a fucking out of touch billionaire dumbass.\n\nCan we please start referring to him as \"South African oligarch Elon Musk\"?\n\nMicrocosm of his whole problem. He isn't mad that big companies own gaming studios, he's mad that his doesn't.\n\nIf he really wanted to fix the problem he invented for himself, he would create a financing board that would find and take applications from independent developers to fund gaming projects, perhaps leveraging Twitters user base to allow public votes on game pitches or trailers. \n\nUsing AI to make games is actually anti the point he thinks he's making. Rather than empowering creatives that don't have a platform he would rather have his AI behind the wheel deciding what content goes into games unilaterally.\n\nIt's similar to how he thinks he's destroying the lame stream media, but he's actually just a different rich asshole putting his thumb on the scale and controlling thought. Some free speech absolutist."

I love you.\n\n&gt; thick ass-controller\n\nFor once, [xkcd #37](https://xkcd.com/37/) doesn't work\n\nIt does though. \"Thick-ass controller\" &gt; \"thick ass-controller\". A controller that is thick-ass vs a controller for ass that is thick (or a controller used by the ass).\n\nThey're talking about how that almost always creates two different items. In the example there's a sweet-ass car, or a cool car, and a sweet ass-car, which would be a cool ass-themed car.\n\nHere a thick-ass controller would be a very girthy controller, while a thick ass-controller would be a thick ass-themed controller, which are one in the same for this post.\n\nThe OG Xbox controller was ridiculously thick. I'm glad this exists lol\n\nDUUUUUUUUKE\n\nI'm pretty sure every single person has at least once tried to put that logo in cause you think it's a button lol\n\nToday we’ve replaced Gabe’s controller with a Kodiak Grizzly Bear.  Let’s see if he notices.\n\nI'm only surprised that the first one I've seen isn't an anime girl\n\nWith pink joysticks.\n\nHopefully just the joysticks. I get the impression a number of Gamers out there would have trouble finding a pink button.\n\nUs elders remember the OG Xbox controllers.\n\nThe Duke is an awesome controller. The button placement was perfect for fighting games.\n\nNot to mention it's a guy's ass and not a chick. Breaking glass ceilings over here.\n\nAs a woman I finally have a reason to get an ass related object\n\nr/dontputyourdickinthat\n\nDo you think the backside is... squishy?\n\nIf it's hard plastic it'll only be half as bulky as an original Xbox controller\n\nFucking love “The Duke” lol, there was actually an official re-release a few years back with bumper buttons added and an OLED screen added under the XBOX logo that played the original boot animation, if it was wireless I’d use it more.\n\nIt’s a fun novelty but there are way better options\n\nI bought an original XBox a while back for the nostalgia and it came with a \"Duke\"\n\n\nI was surprised to find it quite comfortable, contrary to my memory. Then I realized that my memories of that controller came from a time when I had much, much smaller hands, haha.\n\nXbox made the mistake of designing their original controller for adult hands when everyone was already trained to use kid sized controllers.\n\nthey knew they were creating lifelong loyal customers\n\nIt's funny how becoming an adult has completely flipped my view on Xbox v PlayStation controllers. I used to love PlayStation controllers, but now they're a bit awkward. Xbox controllers are fantastic for me, though. \n\nHaving big hands can be annoying. Computer mice, for example, I always have to pay extra for a massive mouse that doesn't feel awkward.\n\nDon't own an Xbox anymore but I also loved the duke and would buy one of these lol. Ima go look it up ty for letting me know it exists haha\n\nAs someone with big hands, I loved Duke.\n\nSame. Favorite controller ever, no question\n\nThere's dozens of us!\n\nBut honestly, yeah -- modern controllers are a matter of how cramped you can make your fingers. I loved the OG Xbox controller, it was perfectly sized. I still love my portables (DSi, etc), but honestly all controllers are cramped compared to the freedom that was The Duke. Wish there was a modern revision.\n\nI don’t think my hands were anything to write home about when I was a kid but it *still* was a comfortable controller. Even if it’s bigger than your grip, it’s more comfortable to overextend your fingers and grip than it is to “claw” your fingers inwards to match a smaller controller. I have issues slipping on PS4 controllers because that thing just wants to flip and tilt in weird ways under my big hand grip.\n\nIt's a huge reason The Claw grip became popular. It may be ridiculous, but it definitely influenced gaming\n\nI'm one of those weird people with huge ham hands that the Duke seemed to be perfect for.  There was definitely room for improvement on it, but it was a really good controller if your hands fit it.\n\nNot OLED cause that would cause horrific burn in (sitting on one logo 90% of the time) but it’s easily my favorite controller for casual games, so comfortable. But if I’m playing something serious I have to use a controller with better bumpers (I’m sorry Duke don’t hate me)\n\nThe Duke was the best and I’ve always said a company should make Duke-sized controllers for the segment of the market that would be all for it. Don’t know why we don’t have different-sized controllers anyways, considering the variety of hand sizes in gaming.\n\nHyperkin still sells them apparently, I just looked and the are on Amazon\n\n[deleted]\n\nI want a middle paddle to come out when I squeeze the cheeks hard enough.\n\nit becomes an N64 controller\n\nWhere do you put the batteries?\n\nIt’s probably going to be hard plastic for manufacturing and longevity of the product. A soft back would be like someone buy those anime mouse pads.\n\nRelevant Penny Arcade comic:\n\nhttps://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2002/03/25/ursine-adventures\n\nI always loved this one: [https://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2001/11/28/the-rest-of-the-story](https://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2001/11/28/the-rest-of-the-story)\n\nMy friend and I noticed ten years later that they were sitting on the Xbox itself.\n\nMy God that makes me feel old. My friend sent me that because he loved to make fun of my Xbox and wanted a ps2\n\nUsername most certainly checks out\n\nWould be cool if there was a haptic feedback and functionality pressing down on the cheeks\n\nSeptic feedback\n\nIt better be otherwise what's the point\n\nGonna be some weird porn on Twitter of people's fursonas hotdogging their controller as it vibrates.\n\nOh my ..  why\n\n\nWell, I cherish what innocence is still left in me.\n\nif the one they make isn't plushy, i bet there will be some third party that will make a mod for it with adjustable firmness.\n\nI wouldn't hold out hope for 3rd party accessories on a limited edition controller.\n\nif that butt don't go squish squish, someone will make that booty go squishy squish\n\nMaybe if they can find a way to make it fit all controllers.  The butt cover that comes with it probably just removes and leaves the same open battery compartment as all others.  So any controller could adopt a soft butt variant.\n\nPlease say it is lol\n\n i hope so\n\nNo bulge on the front? 😔\n\nThat is the wolverine one\n\nHis looks more like an N64 controller\n\nbecause of the 3 claws right?\n\nRIGHT?\n\nHe has a seventh claw that he doesn't show anyone\n\nAdamantium covered bone-r\n\nThe *real* man of steel\n\nThat's Colossus ;)\n\n_So long gay Bowser!_\n\nAnd you won’t need a banana for scale\n\nThere's already joysticks to play with\n\nI feel like that's kinda the joke others aren't getting isn't it? That you have basically his hips in your hand and so the front of the controller would be...\n\nA boil and a micropenis with Peyronie's?\n\nYou’ll get one in the front once you grip the back of that controller.\n\nMust be lady deadpool\n\nI'll believe it when I squeeze it.\n\nImagine changing the batteries 😂\n\nI hope the controller comes with battery safe lube. \n\nWould silicone based lube be conductive? 🤔\n\nNo, silicone grease and lubricant are not conductive, they’re very good electric insulators.\n\nThe butteries if you will.\n\nPrise the cheeks apart, slip the old ones out &amp; the new ones in... controller gives a little moan to confirm correct seating 😂\n\nHonestly that'd be the most Deadpool feature ever\n\nController starts vibrating when you insert the batteries.\n\nThe batteries it comes with are shit.\n\nSo jealous of that joke.\n\nIt's a one-off sweepstakes prize\n\n[deleted]\n\nI was ready to go buy one \nGot fucking cockteased by a Deadpool controller\n\nThis is Microsoft's Xbox division we're talking about here. It's run by six monkeys in a factory randomly pulling levers, most of which are just labeled \"GamePass\".\n\nNow be fair. Someone had to put in real work making the levers that say GamePass on them before they got laid off.\n\nTrue, those 6 month temps worked very hard to make it.\n\nAdd it to the list of “Sony’s only winning right now because Microsoft’s won the ‘Slamming Your Own Dick with a Car Door” prize X number of years in a row.”\n\nThere was some tweet that summed it up once, to the tune of \"Sony is run by people who might drown if it rains, but they still manage to dominate because Xbox are the ten year champions of slamming their own dick in the car door.\"\n\nlol. Seriously though. I love my ps5 and my library. Been playing on their platform since the og PS1. \n\nBut man I wish Xbox would get their crap together and release some good content. Their current gen offerings make Sonys look possibly prolific. And that’s before looking at the dud that was Redfall or the meh Starfield. \n\nCmon Microsoft. Don’t screw up fable on me.\n\nMicrosoft has by far the worst advertising company out there. Things that should have done amazing but msft advertising division was so bad they failed \n\n-\twindows phone\n-\tzune\n-\tsurface pro\n-\tXbox one \n\nThose 3 alone should have been insane hits but they stumbled on the delivery killing the product.\n\nHonestly, Microsoft has the Fuck You money to capture any market they want, and make people like it, but they seem to be run by 3 monkeys sharing a single braincell.\n\nHoly shit this was funnier than I expected\n\nWhat expectations did you have for that comment?\n\nI’ll be honest I go in with low expectations for most everything\n\nIt was the best of times, it was the blurst of times.\n\n&gt;most of which are just labeled \"GamePass\"  \n  \nEven then they still can't make a functional PC app.\n\nI would honestly buy this in a **heartbeat.**\n\nMy one S controller needs to be replaced, and yeah I could wait for the replacement with haptics that was leaked, but I love Deadpool.\n\nI hardly even use my Series X but I'd have bought it for the novelty. Lightly use it for some pc games or something.\n\nYeah, xbox controllers on PC work wonders. Like, plugnplay, most games recognize them immediately too. \n\nI wish it was as easy with PS ones, I like the built in sound, a fun little gimmick.\n\nSteam recognizes all controllers pretty much. It recognizes my Rumble Pad 2 that's more than 15 years old and has no X-input. Only downside compared to newer controllers (like Xbox) is that there is no analog trigger.\n\nThe value vs cost is hugely different in the Microsoft vs Sony arena as far as what you get goes.\n\nAt $200 the PS Pro is a scam. Though you get 4 additional buttons, 2 of those are primarily for quick profile switching and aren't in an ideal spot for most use cases anyways. Also the battery life is horrrrrrrrrrrrrible. My God.\n\nOn the flipside, I ordered one of those Design Labs Elite 2 controllers, and again, cost is ridiculous yes, but it doesn't have the problems the PS Pro controller does.\n\nI'm not even a xbox guy, but i would buy one for pc games, or to literally just to  have\n\nMe too. I Don't own anything xbox related but I'm down with this kind of novelty items that burn holes in my wallet\n\nThe Xbox controllers work AMAZING on PC.\n\nhmm I wonder if Microsoft works with Windows or something\n\nYou'd think so, but you're always one Windows update away from 'no'.\n\nThey are literally design for PC now. They are called Xbox controllers for Windows and come with the USB dongle\n\nI just bought a Xbox controller with a 9 ft USB-C cable but what is the dongle I'm hearing about. I sometimes plug my computer into my TV so I wanted to go fully wireless and my old controller doesn't have Bluetooth. The problem I'm maybe going to have in the future is that I don't believe my Mic will work over USB with the controller. I'm getting audio to the headset but the voice memos and testing on discord isn't coming back with anything. I was hearing about a dongle vet worked for the older Xbox controllers to have them work on PC, is that what you're referring to? \n\nAnd yes on the back of the box for the controller It is branded for Microsoft as well\n\nWould have gotten a purchase out of me and I don’t buy shit like this normally.\n\nI don't even own an Xbox but I would buy the shit out of this.\n\nI want those furry Sonic controllers\n\nBut producing them also costs a lot, and this is probably the result of limited time marketing money for the film.\n\n\nSweepstakes will net them a lot of money, too.\n\nI haven't owned an XBox since the 360. I don't see any reason to even buy another one. This controller though? I'd buy in a heartbeat\n\nYou stopped me from waking up my sick wife.\n\n\nI don't get companies. We don't even have an Xbox and I would buy this.\n\nInb4 whoever wins auctions it on ebay in the future.\n\nMy exact thought. This controller is definitely going to be a valuable collector’s item\n\nMy day is ruined. \n\nProbably because this controller plays like ass.\n\nYeah it’s a neat collectors item but actually playing on this thing would be a nightmare.\n\nAnd if it's one thing gamers, comic fans, and Marvel fans hate it's collectibles.\n\nidgaf, I'd buy one for the collection and one to use. and I don't even own an xbox.\n\n…or maybe you’re just a bum.\n\nHonestly this thing is a low-run one-off from the factory, it'll probably have issues that the mass market versions don't.\n\nNah man. That's the template that 100 different companies will use to make 1000 3rd party controllers.\n\nWhat the crap I came here to immediately buy one.\n\nConsidering Microsoft now owns Activision, this would be an excellent time to renew the Deadpool license in order to relist the game.\n\nYou must be new. Xbox doesn’t really do “games,” they just make a thousand different controllers\n\nThat’s a bit disingenuous. They have no problem buying gaming studios then closing said studios after one poor launch, or even one wildly successful launch.\n\n*cries in hi fi rush*\n\nJust finished it this morning.\n\nOne of the most fun experiences I have ever went through. The gameplay just felt right. At first I was struggling with hitting those notes, but then everything clicked when I realized I was focusing too hard. Just listen to the music and play the tunes on those attacks, parries, and dodges.\n\nDamn that game is fun.\n\nI gotta shove batteries up Deadpool’s ass every time to change them omg\n\nI never thought I'd describe an XBox controller as phat, but here we are.\n\n[deleted]\n\nMaybe she’s born with it, maybe it’s *the duke*\n\n[deleted]\n\nIt better be squishy\n\nDamn, between the ass and controller vibration, the player is in for a good time\n\nIt’s just a prize, not available for purchase. And you have to do twitter bullshit for it. So… nah.\n\nNow imagine how much money they would make if they made a Nier Automata 2B ass controller\n\nMy main question is: how will you access the battery cover for the AA batteries\n\nYou spread the cheeks\n\nLick to open\n\nA battery is placed in each cheek. You stick a finger in the back access port and dig around until you find them to pull them out. Then you have to apply the battery grease to ensure new batteries don't tear anything when you push them back in.\n\nCharge it with a usb-c cable between the cheeks\n\nMagic mouse style\n\nIt looks like the butt is the battery cover. It probably will come with a normal one ass well.\n\nEven though I’m a PlayStation girlie I kind of want at least the controllers\n\nOk, I kinda need it and I don't even have an Xbox. \n\nIt's Bluetooth and Xbox makes the most ergonomic controllers. \n\nPlus the thought of me having my hands on Ryan Reynolds ass the entire time I wipe a town clean of zombies is kinda appealing.\n\nSadly it's a one-off contest prize\n\nDamnit.\n\nThat controller is NOT ergonomic\n\nI use an xbox controller with my PC, even wanted to get a BT-enabled motherboard, just bought a cheap BT dongle for now. Bonus points for working with sound too.\n\nIt looks like an ass cosplays as daredevil.\n\nThese are going to sell like hot cakes.\n\nNay!\n\nLike hot buns.\n\nShame its not selling\n\nSpecial contests only\n\nIf it's a contest I bet it'll be just US, Canada, and maybe the UK.\n\nSigh... the rest of the world doesn't exist, I guess.\n\nIt is available to participate in countries with Xbox support.\n\nit's not America's Ass, but it will do\n\nstupid ps5 never gets cool butt controllers\n\nThere should be a wolverine version with a yellow bulge on the front.\n\nIf you made it an anime girl's butt or boobs, you would sell to thousands.\n\nJustGamerThings\n\nFor science reasons of course.\n\nI assume its just a joke and they aren't actually making it right? How the hell would you hold that?\n\n2 fingers in the hole\n\nFinger....\n\nBut whole.\n\nDog.\n\nThe butt part looks removable.\n\nPretty sure they are only making one for the sweepstakes same with a series X deadpool console but that doesn't look too good just looks like a wrap.\n\nLooks like a silicone sleeve, based on how indented all the buttons are.\n\nIs it scratch and sniff\n\nAll I can see is Patrick Star\n\nAss controller before GTA VI\n\nImagine the backlash if this was a female character instead.\n\n[deleted]\n\nGood thing he's a Male character.\n\nGrab those hard man cheeks like you mean it, baby!\n\nThis reminds me that while Christmas shopping at Marshall’s last year they had a bunch of gaming character statues that were designed to hold your controllers, like they were standing with their arms forward to hold the controller for you. The Deadpool one was the only one that was different, he was bent over sticking his butt out and holding his arms behind him to hold the controller.\n\nDeadpool rocks.\n\nSomeone… is going to fuck that controller\n\nNever thought I'd see the day were I'd have to give a controller back shots.\n\nThey could put a chonky ass battery in there and gave 900hrs of gameplay per charge.\n\nMan I really gotta start being responsible and stop wasting my money on frivolous things that I don’t really need.\n\n…After I buy this.\n\n[deleted]"

    "all_comment_text": "Wow they actually backtracked. I'm impressed\n\nAlthough are they gonna relist the game worldwide?\n\nThat, annoyingly, is unclear. AFAIK, all we know right now is that PSN will no longer be required. I'm HOPING they relist the game worldwide, but I wouldn't hold my breath when it comes to Sony\n\nEdit: spelling\n\nWas Sony the one who delisted the game, or was is Steam? If it was the latter, then I suspect they'll relist it.\n\nI assumed it was Steam because they were sick of processing all the refunds due to the valid \"PSN not available in my country\" reason.\n\nthey didnt refund me even though i mentioned this reason yesterday, just said i played over 2 hours\n\nI've read here that you have to write twice on the same issue, because the first response is an auto generated one, but when you answer that, you get an actual tech support person to handle your case.\n\n&gt;you get an actual tech support person to handle your case.\n\nWho eats the tech support cost?\n\nValve, from all the billions of dollars they roll in from every summer sale.\n\nAnd the interest from my wallet for over ten years\n\nand revenue from cs2 case opening and steam market tax revenue\n\nValve. They pay their employees and that's just the cost of doing business. I work at a grocery store so that would be like asking who eats the cost when I get my paycheck. The company does. They decided my work is worth money so they're willing to \"eat the cost\" that it takes to pay me.\n\nValve is one of the most lucrative companies for its headcount *in the world*, they can afford the tech support cost.\n\nValve prob pays the tech support, but id assume they are charging sony for all the refunds\n\nThe only reason sony is removing req imo is the $40m bill thats about to hit them, i doubt they really care about the users\n\n[deleted]\n\nWell it's Steam's tech support, so there's no way Sony could have been involved\n\nThis makes me giggle. The thought of Sony having customer support, I mean. Has anyone ever spoken to Sony customer support? Last time I did I was essentially told to fuck off after they double charged my card for a digital purchase. EA has a well earned reputation for sucking total ass, but even they made a modest effort at staffing some level of support. Sony just says give me your money now fuck off.\n\nI’ve heard it’s an automated no with the first attempt because of time played. If you were to try again, apparently some people have had some luck. \n\nThey also take into account how many refunds your account has had overall and probably the time frame between refunds. So, if you’ve refunded a lot of games or something recently it’s less likely you’ll receive another refund.\n\nI had 70+ hours in the game and live in a country that allows PSN, but still got my refund. I have only refunded like 3 games in the past 15 years though, so maybe they did indeed take that into account.\n\nI got a quick response, very happy with how they dealt with it.\n\nIt was likely Steam.\n\nIronically Sony did something sort of similar to CD Projekt Red with Cyberpunk. It released on consoles and even without all the bugs (which there were many) it was so clearly not meant to run on last gen hardware. \n\nPeople in droves went to CD Projekt Red for a refund and the short of it is CD Projekt Red told them to request a refund through PSN.\n\nSony was like aight we'll deal with the refund mess you're throwing at us but they also straight up stopped selling the game on the Playstation Store.\n\nIt was probably steam but don't quote me on it. Because refunds were involved, they probably didn't want to continue selling a game that wasn't playable in a couple of days. \n\n\nExpect a second announcement to clarify that further.\n\nTruth is no one knows because there hasn't been an official response stating who delisted it.\n\nI mean, it's a start. So they just might, even if it takes time.\n\n\nAnd if they don't, well, we made the noise and they listened, so why not just repeat that for this issue too?\n\nMan I still miss the days when games were 512 kilobytes of Mask Rom in a plastic square where bugs and typos where forever and nothing of that drm cross account tomfoolery was possible. You could buy, lend, rent. That thing was forever.\n\n\nFuck that noise man\n\nDon’t forget to schedule your colonoscopy, old man.\n\n[removed]\n\nAs an almost 40yo man, you deserve an upvote.\n\nYou.  Off my lawn.  Now.\n\nWouldn't be surprised if it was something Steam pre-emptively did on their own behalf, in order to avoid even more potential refunds. I'd assume it'll be reverted sooner than later.\n\nNot refunds, but avoiding a legal kerfuffle.\n\nIf I had to guess it's all the refunds that did it\n\nCould have been as little as Steam letting on that they’d refund the game.  \n\n Sony might have been gambling on it being too late, and calculated the hit they’d take with the idea refunds wouldn’t be issued. But then Steam offered refunds. A lot of the community were slowly rumbling towards a class action, too - because too many made a point about Helldivers 2 being sold on regions that can’t access a PSN account, and a lot more noted their little terms &amp; FAQ stealth edit that they’d hoped nobody would know about. \n\nSony might have simply thought “shit, they’re onto us, and they have the smoking gun..” because Sony would have gotten destroyed if this was taken to court. They sold access to a game, then denied that access, in 177 legal jurisdictions. They. Were. Fuuuuuuuuuuuuucked. \n\nI honestly wouldn't be surprised if the EU also made rumblings about wading into this situation. Without looking, I'm sure that all EU countries are in the PSN, but the precedent of \"You buy this product, then we add in a requirement that makes you invalid to use it, suck a dick.\" is one they seem like they'd be quite keen to put the smack-down on even if it's not EU citizens getting harmed by it.\n\n[removed]\n\nThe EU voting bloc has been flexing it's economic power for the past few years and I am absolutely here for it.\n\nForcing Apple to ditch lightning chargers and move to USB-C was just the beginning of what they're able to accomplish.\n\nAs a former North American Applecare rep, I get wood every time I see the EU turn to Apple and go \"Uh...no, bitch?\"\n\nApe, together, strong.\n\nAhh, if so then yeah, that's pretty much guaranteed to bring down the EU Banhammer.\n\nYeah Latvia, estonia and lithuania\n\nThe blowback from this was historic and for inarguably their most successful PS/Steam game. \n\nLove to see this.\n\nNothing unites helldivers more than a common foe that won't accept freedom.\n\nWe will show them our peaceful ways by force!\n\nI'm willing to bet the Forbes article was a big push. When your decision goes beyond the intended audience, things get serious.\n\nI mean, \"Sony is taking a stupid decision that is single-handedly ruining an unintended successful live service game\" is not exactly a headline that puts Sony in a good light for investors...\n\nAh Sony\n\nThey somehow snatched defeat from the Jaws of Victory\n\nand then the monster from said jaw got so fucking angry it just refused to eat anything anymore\n\nI cannot actually believe they didn't make this situation worse. It's actually miraculous\n\nIt definitely did get worse before it got bad. They did a lot of stupid things in the past couple of days. \n\n\nIf I were an executive at Sony I'd slam the brakes on this bitch faster than you could brew a cup of liber-tea. They took way too long in internet time.\n\nThat's just corpos though. Middle managers all the way down.\n\nThey backtrack all the time after doing something stupid and paying for it. \n\nWhen the original Walkman came out they only played Son's propiratory cassettes.  People bought it, realized it couldn't play normal cassettes and returned it. They backtracked real quick and came out with another model that played normal cassettes. \n\nThey've done this numerous times since. \n\nRemember those mini-CDs around 2004, they lost a billion dollars company wide on that. I had gone to Sony Online after Westwood Studios started laying off people. I got in as a Star Wars Galaxies CSR and was trying to get onto the EverQuest II design team. They couldn't hire me because of that freeze and I wound up getting a design job somewhere else.\n\nWestwood Studios? Did you work on the Command and Conquer games? They were my whole childhood haha.\n\nsame here. pretty sure i still got the original CDs for the first 4 games lying around somewhere\n\nYeah you're going to have to source that claim on the Walkman, the original was based on the TCM-100B Pressman that used Phillips Compact Cassettes. Sony engineers removed the recording function, and added stereo playback, as it was originally a mono device.\n\nSo they lost on mini-CDs, but they won on DVDs and Blu-ray. It's a strategy that has won for them in the long run.\n\n&gt;When the original Walkman came out they only played Son's propiratory cassettes. \n\nCurious.  Do you have a reference for this?\n\nHoly shit the review divers won the war\n\nThe refunders won the war\n\nThis. The fact Steam waived the 2hr play limit for refunds probably sent the shitters up Sony.\n\ngod i love it when steam enables people who otherwise may be screwed to throw a molotov on a corporation's money pile.\n\nI mean sure steam did it but it was most likely someone in their legal departement telling them it was either that or get unwillingly sucked into this debacle when someone inevitably comes knocking with those pesky ´consumer protection laws´\n\nIt’s definitely this. Sony made the mistake of publicly stating their plan to deny access of a service to those who paid for that service in 177 legal jurisdictions.\n\nIf Steam doesn’t offer the refunds, technically they’re the ones actually running the scam for Sony. They’re the merchants selling a game that you cannot legally access even after purchase. They’d be just as fucked legally.\n\nSo? They allow refunds. One way or another they’ll get the money back from Sony - but even if they don’t, it’s cheaper than ending up part of that legal shitstorm. \n\nI figure they're not too worried because they can take all the money from Ghosts of Tsushima's PC launch.\n\nOne way or another Valve will get their money back from Sony.\n\nHilariously, after this blew up, the Ghosts of Tsushima devs made a point to say that the single player mode would NOT need a PSN account/linkage, so clearly someone on the Ghosts of Tsushima side wanted to avoid being caught in the crossfire, heh.\n\nIts more like some countries consumer laws that did it. Steam just trying to avoid two things \n\n1) Their store front coming to the notice of regulators world wide\n\n2) Absolutely huge fines from jurisdictions like the EU.\n\n[deleted]\n\nI'd argue what won it was Valve allowing that many refunds.  A lot of that money likely was already planned on being spent and Sony now is looking at a nasty chunk of their profits having gone down the shitter and a massive damage to their already damaged PR image.\n\nThis hurt them more than any competitor could have.  The community may never recover from that.  They were on the edge of having an effective golden goose for their development studios and they might have killed it for a few eggs.\n\nThe war isn’t over. This is what companies and governments do. They push these crazy things and people freak out but also get a bit used to the idea. The next time they suggest this they understand what the feedback and response will be so they can get out in front of it. Also the outcry is subdued because people don’t have the energy to fight the same fight and non users get tired of hearing about it. And/or they build it into helldivers 3 and drop support for 2. This is more of an indication of what’s to come than what’s in the past. At least it delays it a bit. \n\nRequiring external accounts for steam games (especially online games) is nothing new and frankly people would not care at all if it was required from the start. It's the change in policy after release that rightfully pissed people off\n\nWhile this may be true, I'd wager almost none of them change their scores back. Which may or may not be warranted.\n\nEdit: based on replies to my post, seems about 70/30 in favor of people changing their reviews back. Not bad, perhaps it should be left as a reminder to Sony.\n\nI changed mine the second I heard the news\n\nCompanies should be punished for bad decisions and \"rewarded\", or really just equalized in this case, for good ones. I hope most people recognize how big a deal it is this worked, but also recognize that some tiny amount of good will should go to Sony for changing tact.\n\nI wouldn't keep shitting on them after this reversal, as that might make them wonder if it was worth reversing at all.\n\nObligatory fuck Sony and MS, and all these companies trying to squeeze blood from a stone.\n\nYou can say fuck Sony in the review and still recommend helldivers 2.\n\nThis thinking is abusive in nature, you reward when they do the right thing, and scold when they do the wrong thing.  If you scold while they do the good thing then they don’t see that it’s good and just say “fine fuck you I’ll do what I want regardless of what you think since your just going to treat me like shit either way”.  Keep this advice in mind if you ever become a parent\n\nIts not rewarding, its rescinding punishment for a rescinded action.\n\nYes, and that’s a healthy thing to do for corrected behavior\n\nI think they should change their reviews back. Review bombing and refunding is the stick. Seeing the reviews go back up and hopefully sales increase is the carrot. \n\nGive Sony, and any other companies watching, a reason to listen. Otherwise if things are still in the can they’ll be less likely to change their mind later since the damage is already done.\n\nI kind of think that the devs not requiring PSN at launch was the right move. They amassed a large userbase that had the power to make Sony back off when they eventually made PSN a requirement.\n\nIt WAS required at launch. It destroyed Sony’s servers from everyone rushing to make a PSN account. It was day 2 they added the skip button.\n\nSaw this in war thunder. Make unpopular decision and if the playerbase retaliates they will go back. Hitting them in the pocket and review bombing is effective.\n\nI think the refund divers had more impact.\n\nThis was too much backlash even for Sony. Not just money wise, this was destroying all good will the game generated over these past months. For once, they had a live service game people were itching to play, that they enjoyed and had minimal controversy about it.\n\n\nSony has been chasing the golden goose of live service games for years, that's why they bought Bungie who had a successful game in Destiny 2.\n\n\nThe endless refunds, bad reviews, bad press and endless criticism, was too much even for them to bury their head in the sand. Helldivers 2 is what Sony chased for years and they were going to destroy it out of sturbbonness unless they folded.\n\n\nA much better time to reverse this was about 3 days ago though.\n\n1 day to digest the bad news.\n\n1 day hoping it'll die down.\n\n1 day discussing what to do.\n\nToday finally taking action.\n\nYes basically. I think that 3 day time frame is totally reasonable. You realistically cant expect such a gargantuan size company to make a snap quick decision its just not how things are done. \n\n(Also weirdly I think the 3 day time frame is better for the community too. If they did it right away, I think people still would’ve been angry and focusing on the bad taste left in their mouths. Now, people are happy that the “hard fought battle has been won”….  when people get what they want too quickly it’s often felt unsatisfying and I think the three day timeframe was just right for people be excited and *happy* about the result\n\nad hoc simplistic shelter caption toy sip direction tan point roof\n\nEspecially a holiday weekend in Japan.\n\nI mean they announced it for a reason (bad news doesn't get better with time)... but they chose to time it right before their holiday, another unforced error imo\n\nIt’s probably just 1 day to dicusss internally and decided to call Sony.  1 day trying to squish in a meeting with the higher up to call this. \n1 day where the meeting happened.  \n\nWhich is still surprisingly fast for a massive corporation like Sony.\n\nLiterally weekend\n\n[deleted]\n\nMost likely scenario is that the decision required a meeting, and while bungling one or two people to show up on the weekend is doable, getting everyone involved is almost certainly not.\n\nProbably not that simple, could've needed a whole team to make the change, and that's unrealistic for a weekend.\n\nIt's fucking Sony. They do stupid shit all the time. They fall upwards.\n\nI still remember when they *literally* shipped rootkits and spyware on their music CDs as an utterly twisted form of DRM.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_BMG_copy_protection_rootkit_scandal\n\n[removed]\n\nIt takes time to turn a ship around as big as Sony is.\n\nDefinitely true. Shit like this takes multiple meetings and approval from probably csuite. I'm kinda shocked it happened as fast as it did. \n\nGiven it's the weekend, gotta give kudos for it getting boxed off at 6am UTC\n\nOr one giant meeting and several email exchanges... But yes, it is quite impressive they made it happen so fast.\n\n[removed]\n\nThis reminds me of when Ferrari weren't all that happy about some rule changes in Formula 1 in the late 80's, and their solution was to build a fully-compliant Indycar then use it to force the FIA to make a choice between backtracking, or having Ferrari leave the sport (and all the negative press it'd get with the \"Scuderia Ferrari to leave Formula 1\" headlines). This would basically be like if Barcelona were to have legitimate reason for threatening LaLiga with leaving to go play the Catalan league instead.\n\n\nBasically what the playerbase did, Sony having their golden goose in Helldivers 2 then fucking it all up would be as disastrous to Sony as Ferrari bailing on F1 would've been to them.\n\nFerrari always gets their way in F1. thats why its called F1, Ferrari First.\n\nI love democracy.\n\nAnd they hate chargebacks\n\nSony isn't used to a platform where refunds exists\n\nWhich is why people would issue chargebacks instead, which would make Sony look terrible to creditors.\n\nWould you like to guess what happens to PlayStation accounts that have a single charge back in them? There are plenty of easy to find stories of people losing their entire library, account, and saves because Sony deleted their account.\n\nWhich is why Steam is the best store front, with the Steam Deck making it even better\n\nyet another reason the PSN account linking would be just awful\n\nSo more like they hate capitalism in the form of negative returns.\n\nWhaaaat, are you saying people only like corporate capitalism when it works out for them?? \n\nThat can't be right because everybody *loves* corporate subsidies and bailouts, that's a fact\n\nThat's not true. I actually hate free money. Whenever people give me money, I say \"Dangit, I hate this\".\n\nyes palpatine you sure do\n\nI love the Republic\n\nNow if everyone could do this with all goods across the board, and stop consuming so much for a while, the companies would stop price gouging us and blaming \"inflation\".\n\nMoney talks. Take it away and these major corporations would change their tone.\n\nEdit: Man, y'all are some hard headed folks. There have been a lot of \"wELL wE cAnT jUsT NoT eAT!!\" comments and I'm not saying that. I mean stop buying doritos and big macs. If everyone banded together and stopped buying doritos and other non-necessities, they wouldn't be $6 a bag anymore. They'd correct. A meal at mcdonalds wouldn't be $14 anymore, it would go back to $6. But I realized through this thought experiement that it will never happen and the companies know this. So if we as a society can't come together and vote with our wallets, then stop complaining about the price of things.\n\nYou aren't wrong, but this isn't a \"money talks\" situation like you think.  Steam reviews went down to 13% and the game still had over 100k players playing concurrently today like any other day.  Most people still went on with playing the game as normal while leaving a bad review.\n\nYeah but those reviews could affect future sales\n\nDon't forget that many customers are now resistant, hesitant or on the fence to buy any new game published under Sony on PC.\n\nGamers have very short attention spans. This will have a minimal effect on any future Sony sales imo.\n\nThis kind of stuff builds up over time. Reputational damage is generally long-running, rarely catastrophic. It's a limiting move. It makes the future harder to plan for, more uncertain. It's bad for business but not immediately. \n\nPut another way, many people will now ask \"Is Sony going to screw me over?\" before buying. Many of them will say \"Eh, might as well play.\" And you can say that it doesn't affect the bottom line. But they'll have that thought. Would they, before all this? What if they take a conscious risk, and it happens again? That's how you lose a customer. So yes, no bottom line impact this year. But make no mistake - they're on thinner ice than they were yesterday. That little moment of hesitation can be very destructive.\n\nThis happens in all media too, some good example recent examples are the MCU and Star Wars.\n\nFor Star Wars 7,8, and 9, the sales steadily declined. They still made a profit, but the whole idea of a star wars franchise bombed when Solo did not make a profit, so it affects the peripheral movies too.\n\nTake the MCU too. They had such good will from Endgame that basically the next 6 years of mid movies still turned a profit. However, Disney losing money on The Marvels finally showed them that reputation does matter, and they're slowing the releases down.\n\n&gt; they're slowing the releases down.\n\nHow about making the releases good? Go back to the original plan of having the plot-relevant Scarlet Witch become the ultimate hero, rather than having Feminist-in-a-Cape fly in and unfuck the whole situation with... GIRL POWER!\n\nI assume someone at Sony had to finally run the numbers at how many players they would lose by doing the PSN linking. It had to be a huge loss in revenue, otherwise they probably wouldn’t have done it.\n\n\nI fucking hate corporations.\n\nIf anyone thinks they didn't run the numbers or consult legal/marketing experts, they are kidding themselves. All would have been overwhelming \"this is terrible for brand and revenue across the entire product line\". If it hadn't been, there absolutely wouldn't be an embarrassing backflip at all (I originally wrote 'backflop' which also seems appropriate somehow).\n\n[deleted]\n\nCan't unshoot yourself in the foot, you can only try to heal.\n\nThe scar will remain though\n\nhopefully as a reminder.\n\nAnybody wanna take bets on if they learned anything from this?\n\nThe lesson will be to always push for PSN sign in from the very beginning of every future game is my guess.\n\nSelling the game outside the PSN was probably the biggest reason for the walk back on this. They opened themselves up to legal jeopardy doing that.\n\nI honestly wouldn't have been nearly as *mad* if they didn't do that.\n\nAnnoyed and irritated, absolutely, but let's be real, making a PSN account isn't *difficult* unless you live in one of the places where you need ID to verify your age, which is its own level of bullshit.\n\nBut selling the game in places you know were going to be unavailable to play it down the line and pulling the rug out from under them is absolutely beyond the pale.\n\nThey learned that they need to do it at launch, and can’t do it retroactively\n\nThey crossed the line too noticeably. You gotta inch your way past it until it's too late for the consumer to notice. They know how far not to cross, but they'll definitely push the envelope in the future.\n\nyeah, they will probably wait a bit longer, but they will do something similar later this year, I think, just not as blatant. gotta capitalize on the first couple of waves of new users before too many people drop off for other multi-player games this year.\n\nThat if they had launched the game like that there wouldn't have been any issues\n\nYeah they learned people can’t read and they’ll just make it mandatory from launch\n\nWhether you thought this was ridiculous or not the lesson learned here is that users have way more power than they think and if they were just willing to use it they could get companies to change their tune on a lot of awful shit.\n\nPC gaming in general is pretty good at this. They resisted paid exclusives (GFWL, EGS) and paid online (also GFWL). Console people should be taking notes instead of bashing them for not immediately bowing to the whims of every company.\n\nI also think a non-negligible part of it is Arrowhead as well. They do share some measure of blame for the situation, but it’s also clear that they turned the community’s response into a weapon against Sony in their behind the scenes talks — one that worked. \n\nWe still have to see about the follow through, but this is obviously very promising.\n\nHopefully Arrowhead make another game and can successfully self publish.\n\nI think this is a result of Sony waiting too long to try and force the account on people. I think enough \"new\" hype had faded that people were not in a state of FOMO and instead were upset, but perfectly willing to abandon the game if it required a sony account. Had it been required from the start, or if it had been say a week 2 kinda thing, the blow back woulda been much less. That is probably the takeaway they got from this also.\n\nThat's the annoying thing about being part of the gaming community is just seeing so many people being like \"meh, what can you do?\" And accepting predatory shit in gaming.\n\nAh, the American political system. Oh this is a gaming subreddit?\n\nCanada's system too!\n\nIts like they forgot how players raised a shitstorm so big over Battlefront 2's paid lootboxes that it ended up getting the attention of traditional news media, politicians and lawmakers and probably also Disney who forced EA to remove the paid option\n\nNot to mention even going as far as attacking the people protesting and calling them whiners and babies.\n\nThe amount of “I’m embarrassed to be a gamer” posts I see on this topic, as though gamers as consumers don’t have a right to voice their annoyance at literally anything, is what was truly embarrassing.\n\nThis decision literally proves that people’s push back was justified.\n\nNot only accepting it, but actively arguing for it.\n\nPlaystation quite literally picked the wrong playerbase to fuck with lmfao\n\nHelldivers is literally about throwing bodies at a problem until it's solved, and by god are they good at doing that\n\nLike when WotC thought that they could screw with legalize a fanbase that reads long legalize and argues about it for fun.\n\nWe pushed automatons out of existence. We killed 2 billion bugs in 12 hours. This community was trained, for the last 3 months, to go all-in on any problem we face.\n\nThe main difference is that PC is fundamentally an open platform. If someone does something you don't like, you can tell them to kick rocks and go somewhere else. Hardware, storefront, games, even the operating system, you never have just one option and you don't burn your hardware, friends, and your entire library by switching.\n\nConsoles, once you buy into one, they have you over a barrel because it's a closed platform. Sure, you can still make a stink, but it's gonna hurt a lot more. PC gamers were able to resist GFWL because they could just play the decades of games that already existed with free online multiplayer.\n\n&gt;users have way more power than they think \n\nAnyone who thinks users don't have *all* the power when it comes to the *video games* industry is deluded. This isn't the food industry or a utilities monopoly, nobody HAS to play a game. \n\nThe issue is that despite that fact that many people are desperate to play and  companies can get away with almost anything. \n\nAt last, this time, they didn't.\n\nGFWL, what does that stand for?\n\nGame For Windows Live.  It was Microsoft's attempt at making PC gamers pay monthly to play games online like Xbox and PlayStation do.  It crashed and burned and deserved every bit of hate it got.\n\ngames for windows live\n\nIt was one of many failed attempts by microsoft to make windows more like XBOX.\n\nIt failed hard, and unfortunately some games are still tied to GFWL and are a nightmare to get working.\n\nExactly. \n\nA lot of people on the r/playstation sub were scoffing and making fun of the situation but this is what happens when you’re not beholden to one company. Not only did PC players get what they wanted but now it sets a precedent. Steam users just made Sony walk back on their policy, meanwhile PlayStation users struggle to get refunds for something they accidentally purchased/downloaded. Sony needs PC players more than PC players need Sony.\n\nSony fucked up by not rolling this out properly.\n\nAll they had to do is make it optional and add a cosmetic or whatever as a reward for linking accounts.\n\nNo one would have given 2 shits about it.\n\nWow, fans actually won\n\nDon’t try and pull this bullshit off again. But let’s be honest, they probably will\n\nMore likely PSN account linking will be back with some changes (not listed country as “Others”?) rather than removing it completely.\n\nJust like how EA and Ubisoft removed Origins and Uplay and replaced them with EA app and Ubisoft Connect lol\n\nOh Sony will 100% make a PC launcher and/or store, the question never was if but when\n\nGhost of Tsushima will come with trophy overlay, so it’s just a matter of when…\n\n[deleted]\n\nIt's adorable you think they won't do it again\n\nAnother victory for the right side of history.\n\nDemocracy preserved ✅\n\nTu-tu-tu-tuu-tu-du\n\nWait. Does this means companies will actually listen to us if we're loud enough?\n\nGamers, we ride at dawn.\n\nThis should serve as a rallying cry to all consumers of anything \n\nThey will listen to money.\n\nThey did the right thing. That’s a win.\n\nI will take back the shit I said about review bombees. Holy shit it worked. Good job I’m proud to say I am wrong and have my foot in my mouth.\n\nIt wasnt just review bomb, a sizable fraction were trying to refund.\n\nAt least you're brave enough to admit you were wrong, and that takes maturity. Many Sony simps are still pissing and moaning over this.\n\nI hate to even put myself with the Sony simps at all but I really didn’t think they would go back on their decisions and then they pulled back by a mile. I will happily admit I was wrong\n\nIt wasnt just a review bombing, it was an orbital dislike. 200.000+  negative reviews in two days. Who would have thought that a community specificly trained to work together and fight for freedom would work together and fight for freedom lol.\n\n“Orbital Dislike” is now a gold star addition to my personal vocabulary now, thank you so very much\n\n\"We’re still learning what is best for PC players\"\n\nBruh\n\nOutstanding Patriotism\n\n⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\n\n\"You have restored our way of life.\"\n\nSo good old fashioned boycotts and negative reviews do work. It was an incredibly stupid move by Sony to even attempt this.\n\nIt wasn't boycotts or negative reviews. It was refunds.\n\nSometimes you've got to nuke it from orbit.\n\n  \nJust to be sure\n\nThe helldiver players dived sony to hell with their negative reviews. 2\n\nPress 'B' to salute \n\nNah, mine's a hug. Come here buddy!\n\nbullying corporations work\n\nWould love to know what the uninstallation stats were this past week.\n\nSony will only delay the PSN account requirement until people forgot about this. They never give up.\n\n#REMEMBER TO SET YOUR REVIEWS BACK TO POSITIVE, HELLDIVERS!\n\n**For Liberty, Justice and Managed Democracy! For Super Earth!**\n\nI was curious if reviews could easily be flipped back and forth or whether they enforce some sort of restriction or cooldown.\n\nYou can edit the text of your review freely. However if you change from positive to negative (or vice versa), you lose all \"updoots\" on the review.\n\nImagine we did this effort. But in real democracy facing the governments in our respective countries. Anything is possible. You just need to be pissed off enough.\n\nThey learned their lesson; they won't launch any more games until the PSN integration is ready.\n\nr/PS5 is gonna be pissed\n\nReading it now, some comments are calling PC gamers crybabies some agrees to the decisions and what the playerbase was fighting for. Who wouldnt be upset if 90% of the world cant play it.\n\nIt's an absolute cesspool over there. Like yes, please don't bully the billion dollar company they're my friend. Completely delusional.\n\nCan’t say I expected that.\n\nits fucked up that we are impressed by a company actually just listening for once. insane timeline.\n\nObligatory fuck every bootlicker who said negative reviews/refunds didn’t matter and actively tried to put their fellow man down for daring to demand to be treated better and failing to stick up for their foreign brothers and sisters."

    "all_comment_text": "Back in my day the zombies were nazi's!\n\nAre they not anymore?\n\nNope, they've been generic undead for a while now\n\nSince BO2, right? Most maps there had American civilian zombies.\n\nEdit: Now that I think about it, a lot of BO1 maps didn't have Nazi zombies either.\n\n? There were giant swastika banners all over the place in the first map\n\nThat was BO1 Kino first black ops 2 zombie map was transit\n\nWow I took a minute to remember what \"BO1\" meant. Used to play non-stop back in the day.\n\nBecause back then we didn't call it BO1 we called it BLOPs.\n\nI miss this acronym. Blops 1 &amp; 2 were so much fun\n\nJust \"black ops\" for me\n\nI remember gaming 24/7 back then. I got to level 80 on Kino, I thought that was the sickest achievement ever!\n\nNever once heard it called BLOPS though lol everyone just called it Black Ops\n\nIt's funny because your comment is surrounded by people calling it blops\n\nYeah, but I think Kino was the only map in BO1 that actually took place in Germany, not counting the WAW remasters.\n\npeople played maps besides kino?\n\nThe expansion packs were pretty sick in my opinion. Their zombie maps were the only reasons I ever bought their DLC’s\n\nAscension was peak\n\nYeah ascension and moon were pretty good. So was Five actually. I didn't like shangrila or the movie set one they were fine but kinda weird \n\nKino is probably my favorite map but it definitely isn't the only one worth playing \n\nAlso who can forget the classic dead ops arcade!\n\nMost of them were great actually. Kino was just the peak, if you don't count the WaW maps ofcourse\n\nYeah I mean it makes sense with the story given it was a Nazi scientist that created the virus, the plot is so goddamn convoluted now idk.\n\nWw2 had nazis but that's it\n\nI could nerd out and tell about all the different kinds of zombies in each game and map, but i dont think anyones waiting for that here haha\n\nI remember watching a documentary explaining all of the lore behind Zombies on YouTube lmao it is a pretty deep dive, I’m surprised that the story gets so deep\n\nDamn. What a shame\n\nIm pretty sure the zombies were nazis on 2 of the maps in Cold War, devs were just too pussy to add the swastika. I think the story for the 3rd map is that you're trying to stop the villain from establishing the 4th reich by summoning a zombified nazi army from hell.\n\nBut they have some unsavory political beliefs! \n\nThe natzis are alive now, sadly\n\nThere were also Imperial Japanese zombies.\n\nShi No Numa was my favorite map even after Der Riese came out 😭\n\nI loved Der Riese, but the jug bug pissed me off. \n\nI probably favored Verruckt over Shi myself though tbh.\n\n\"Cough cough\" Zombie Army 4:Dead War \"cough\"\n\nSince the comments are full of some miss conceptions here is a list of every nazi's zombie map (in black ops games):\nWaW: all except shi no numa\nBo1:kino der toten and moon\nBo2: none \nBo3: Der einsedrache \nCw: maybe some of the Die Machine zombies and the final boss in Mauer der toten\n\nIn the first map of Cold War they were nazis, in Vanguard too\n\nDon't want to alienate the literal nazi gamergaters that play COD now do we?\n\nThat was mostly because world at war lol but they couldn't keep the ww2 motif forever especially because most newer maps weren't in any ww2 settings\n\nNazi is?\n\nBlackops 6 \n\nFall\n\nPerfect timing \n\nThanks for the blast from the past\n\nFull circle. 🙏🏻\n\nThank you, we all need a blast from the past sometimes!\n\nHow is BlOps6? I'm debating signing up for gamepass for a month to try it out.\n\nI’ve only played the zombies so far, but I’ve been really enjoying it! If you liked Cold War zombies then you’ll most likely enjoy blops 6.\n\nCampaign is good, Zombies is good (I wish there was a classic board up windows map). Multiplayer is alright, I think the maps blow.\n\nIt says a lot that even with some of the worst maps I've ever played in a FPS (fuck you Babylon), the MP is still pretty damn fun.\n\nZombies is definitely the highlight of the game so far, though. And with a third Zombies map sometime before the end of the year, we're eating good.\n\ndam how opinions differ. babylon is my favorite.\n\nIt's the best CoD in years\n\nPersonally I've not enjoyed any of them post Black Ops 4 in 2018 and Cold War in 2021, but 6 has been fantastic so far. There's a ton of unlocks and the campaign is actually pretty beefy.\n\nI don't play zombies, so I don't have an opinion on that, but even the two modes I do play have made it well worth it.\n\n&gt; It's the best CoD in years\n\nPeople say this every single COD that comes out and it's literally never true. \n\nBlack Ops3 in terms of actual gameplay and netcode and audio was a WORLD better than Cold War, BO4, ModernWarfare remake 1 2 and 3, oh and WW2. \n\nSo color me skeptical as fuck that it's the best cod in years when people say it's the best cod in years for the past 6+ COD releases.\n\nEDIT: You're illiterate if you think my comment is saying BO3 is the best COD ever.\n\nRe-read the comment. Point out where I said BO3 was the best cod ever.\n\nExactly.\n\nI didnt.\n\nNow shut the fuck up.\n\n“The best COD in years” and “worse than CODs from before 2020” aren’t conflicting. BO3 is approaching a decade old\n\nThank you . Literally every goddamn time I fall for it too .Probably something to do with sunk cost fallacy why people say that .\n\nI'm confused. If you think blops3 was the last best cod. Then that statement is true... What are you trying to say?\n\nI haven't liked one since mw 2019 and I like this one (and before that bo3)\n\nMP good?\n\nI loved Cold War and enjoyed (though less so) new MW2.  Sounds like I might be due for my every-few-years new COD buy\n\nits been a while since i played COD MP. (last one i played was Ghost)..... i quite enjoy it. sure i'm getting my ass handed to me by all these sliding movements and stuff. but there are games where i do good and i have fun. My only complaint is the maps. It feels like every room is a swiss cheese. 6 entrances. like whats the point of going indoor if there is so many entry points.\n\nThe **250gb+** download really made up my mind. I just want to play zombies.  \nEdit: on console\n\nIf you’re on pc you can customize the download to not include warzone. That’s like 100 GB on its own\n\nIt's 70 gigs for me wtf are you talking about\n\nthe game itself is only around 70 or 80 gb. you have to deselect warzone and the mw games in the download screen.\n\nAhh gotcha, maybe I’ll download then!\n\nJust blop6 MP and zombies is literally a 37gb download on PC\n\nRemember playing Black ops. It was four of us. I don't remember which Black ops or what level it was. I just gotten the raygun and then I got swarmed by zombies shortly after, cuz you know your friends like to separate. I remember crawling and I don't know where I was see my friend dive pretty far away. He dove off a ledge and a few seconds later I was revived apparently he had the ballistic knives that had the revive if you shoot your friend with a knife, it revives them. shot at me and it hit me and I was like holy s*** everyone else saw it we all freaked out. It was great times. Then we died the next level. Great costume! Thanks for reminding me of the great gaming memories.\n\nI loved PAPing the ballistic knife and acting as field medic.\n\nBlack Ops 1 ballistic knife was sooo much fun to use\n\nThe wager matches that had Sticks &amp; Stones, One in the Chamber, Gun Game. I miss it\n\nBallistic knife was from Black Ops 1\n\nNice!!! I love how they made great characters for the original Zombie maps, such as Dempsey, Nikolai, Takeo and Dr.Richtofen, but something about the original map and 4 unknown soldiers always had me so captivated!!! Suppose it was the mystery.\n\nProbably cause its the nationalism and \"hardcore\" division of that time for those characters.\n\nRussia, Japan, Germany, and America.\n\n4 countries against one another, whether in goals or achievements.\n\nYet...  \nUnited against a common enemy: zombies, dark science, and the unknown magic.\n\nNacht also didn't have the characters making quips every 10 seconds, which makes it feel more serious.\n\nI do like the quips though.\n\nFavorite COD Zombies era.\n\nstart flopping and kicking and you can be Raygun!\n\n[https://c.tenor.com/87sb17XQmWsAAAAd/tenor.gif](https://c.tenor.com/87sb17XQmWsAAAAd/tenor.gif)\n\nI have not seen enough of this costume around yet\n\nDo the Kangaroo!\n\nOr illegally sell arms to Iran, ignore the AIDS epidemic, then introduce crack to the inner cities!\n\nThat's Ronald Raygun\n\nme after being two tapped by a crawler\n\nImagine if loot dropped when they bled out\n\nIt does now. Picked up dudes ray gun when he died\n\nWild. Teenage me would have never revived my teammate then tho. I think it was a good mechanic haha\n\nShould also do a packa punched raygun\n\nThis is perfectly executed!\n\nAwesome. Too bad it reminds of all the leaves I need to RAKE!!\n\nDon't rake them. Mow them. They make good fertilizer and your lawn will thank you in the spring.\n\nNot mow, mulch. :)\n\nFallen leaves are an essential part of the eco system, why rake?\n\nThe perks are a great touch!\n\nThis is so good hahaha\n\nRead in south park Mickey mouse voice\n\nI can't hear \"raygun\" Without busting a move.\n\nAnd if I don't, perhaps I can help save breakdancing for the Olympics\n\nand magically a syringe full of morphine can make a man with 6 bullet wounds able to walk again\n\nI can still hear Richtoffen in my head.\n\n\"Ze shotgun is ZO MUCH FUUUN!\"\n\nJust a quick question I’ve been thinking after seeing ur costume.\n\nDo anyone know what is used when your reviving someone back in WW1?\n\nThe game shows a morphine syrette\n\nIf I've learned one thing, you're never getting revived. \nPressing F to pay respect.\n\nQuick, name of the game and level of where you had the highest NON-GLITCH or cheat round of Zombies:\n\n69 (I know, not a meme, noice) Kino Der Toten (the theater) classic Black Ops. \n\nGame took over 6 hours straight, and the last several rounds and loops were so bad that we had 3 downs each time, the last survivor had to get enough kills to be able to buy another gun or the ammo off the wall, pack a punch it in order to actually kill things, and then keep refilling ammo for it til they had enough to buy another gun. The only reason the game ended, was our host had a lost connection, and it literally didn't save to 3 of our systems. I think I was the only one that got the death screen since I was already dead and it let it save to my records.\n\nSo much time lost, but so many good, fun memories with friends. Once anyone got over round 40 in the classic maps, each round usually took 20 min just to clear... insanity. The last hour was the worst, so much stress for little reward.\n\nDoesn't revive you, takes your ray gun...\n\nToo soon to say raygun mate\n\nNo, you don't, Australia has\n\nMaybe if you had the waffle\n\nMy vodka mine!!!\n\nI mean this with the upmost sincerity: this is the best Halloween costume I’ve ever seen and ever will see. Thank you\n\nThe memories of ditching school to go play zombie mode with my friends... thank you for the reminiscence\n\nI like the Bottle caps…. I mean medals\n\nNice touch with the Perk Bottle Cap Medals. Very nice.\n\n\"I'll come back for you in a second! I need to grab some Juggernog quick!\"\n\nI loved old cod\n\nHit the box, get the ray gun. Run to grab juggernaut, go down right next to the vending machine\n\nholy shit bro that's amazing!!\n\nYou look like Soldier from Team Fortress 2 holding a Dr. Grordbort’s laser gun.\n\nThis is the best Halloween costume I've seen. Just knock on their doors and fall out over the porch. Scoot your way toward them lol\n\nLmao good shit\n\nMan needs a small cart of some kind so he can rotate in that physically impossible way about his hips the way they do in the games lmao\n\nYou look like Rowan from Viva la Dirt League. Great costume.\n\nPhenomenal, factual and nostalgic\n\nThat’s fucking fantastic!\n\nWorks every time\n\nDamn that’s good\n\nTank must be jealous of his shin armour\n\nthis shit is so peak 🙏\n\ngood on ya 👍\n\nYou better Pack a punch your gun as soon as possible. Your friends wont be able to revive you on the later rounds when the zombies are tougher.\n\nshould make one of those stick grenades from cod world at war to throw on your hip and further emphasize the zombies nostalgia. \n\nseeing your ww2-esque clothes has me immediately flashing back to memories of when i was in middle school playing nacht der untoten with some buddies, congratulations and i hope you win all of the costume contests! \n\ni just noticed you have a “revive” symbol ontop as well, such a good touch dude seriously.\n\nnice\n\nNeeds more kangaroo hops\n\ndoes anyone still play this? I loved capture the flag\n\n“pls bro I have ray gun” hahaha you killed it\n\nTIL there is a weapon named after a dancer\n\nYou're wearing the same outfit Raygun wore at the olympics as well\n\nRaygun? You breakdancing?\n\nThis is too fucking epic!! Fuck yeah!\n\nmy buddy always made me use thundergun cuz for gods sake id be perma down  \nbut he didnt know the rocket launcher tech hehe\n\nThis is a sick fucking costume dude holy shit\n\nThe raygun sucks in high rounds.\n\nAnd it still break dancers better than her\n\nHoly shit this is legendary, WaW was my favourite Call of Duty hahaha. Thank you! Looks amazing\n\nThe hip hop dancer?\n\nHOLD E HOLD E oh wait wrong game!\n\nI need some help over here\n\nI really want a remake/remaster of this game. Online was awesome, the og zombies with simple hordes were so fun, and the campaign was legit as fuck\n\nI played those games but don't remember anyone with a ray gun\n\nJokes on you.\n\nI'm cosplaying as a Griefer!\n\nIs there something going on with his legs or is it just me\n\n[Raygun](https://tenor.com/kLyHFAUqQsm.gif)\n\nYou've got one of these?\n\nWorld at war was epic\n\nRaygun was a beast of a weapon. I've not played CoD in years. I used to love Zombie mode.\n\nREVIVE ME BRO\n\nHolding □\n\nMan I miss the old zombies so much\n\nThe memories this brought back!! Omg this is so good !!\n\nYou look like Pablo Schreiber here\n\nBest costume ever\n\nso fking well made\n\nIt's not the true Raygun unless you do the kangaroo hop\n\nI killed 50 nazis hank.\n\nAdrien Brody?\n\nFor some reason I expected you to be holding the Australian breaker.\n\nYour facial expression is spot on.\n\nWhy is it so realistic?\n\nThe ray gun is the reason your down. Stop shooting your feet 😂\n\nit's over\n\nLol🤣🤣\n\nBrother, you have quick revive!\n\nThe perk cola bottle caps as medals is a nice touch\n\nInsane execution. Good job man. Make us boys proud!\n\nmicahel have a raygun dont revive him\n\nYeah you've got the ray gun.... That's why your down\n\nI thought you were Rowan from Viva La Dirt League\n\nThis is absolutely wonderful lol. NGL I was that guy a fair few times but was funnier when I was the one reviving those guys\n\nMiss the BO2 zombie days\n\nThis is such a good costume and idea! My best gaming friend from overseas and I would play BO2 zombies constantly back in the day. We haven’t spoke for a few years but I sent him this picture and we reconnected because of it so thank you and good job!\n\n😂😂\n\nThis reminds me Wolfenstein beach map so much!\n\"Help, medic !\"\n\ndon't know why but reminds me COD 1 and 2.. I'm not crying :(\n\n\\*doesn’t revive\\*\n\nAverage ww3 soldier will look like this\n\nI don't know how many people noticed the revive button above his head\n\ngoated\n\nIs it just me or is new zombies not as good?"

Yeah, pick him up with ya wheels!\n\n\"Because I'm wild, yeah!\"\n\nDon't let your dreams be dreams.\n\n\\*whistles the dank engine tune*\n\n\"Stop the wagon!\"\n\nLike, fucking how?\n\n\"I said stop the damn wagon!\" *shakes fist at the sky wagon*\n\nI.  Am.  WAGONBORN!\n\n\nFUS-ROH-DAHHHHHHHHH (he screams after taking a 600mph wagon to the face.)\n\nHey you... you're finally awake.\n\n*Skyrim intro wagon is also travelling at 500mph*\n\nAnd it still takes two months to go up the Throat of the World.\n\nNah, they end up in Starfield at unity traveling that fast\n\nDrovakiin\n\nThis is the best response imaginable...  I am now crying bit, manly dwagon tears.\n\nAll you had to do was stop the damn wagon CJ!\n\nYa. CJ. WHAT KINDA COWBOYS let a dwagon just get away. The sorry kind I tell ya.\n\nThis part got me a full on belly laugh. Fucking Santa Claus zooming across the sky.\n\nChristmas is coming early this year?\n\nand sometimes twice a year\n\n-james bond\n\nYou gotta upgrade your revolver to a Stinger Missile.\n\n[removed]\n\nJOJO\n\nRDR Speedwagon - Time for Me to Fly\n\nYou can’t stop Santa.  \n\n“I WOULD IF I COULD BUT I CAN’T!”\n\nGotta go fast\n\n*Dies to one of those wagons*\n\nYou're too slow. Wanna try again?\n\nThey’ve gone plaid!\n\nwhere's Sonic when you need him?!\n\nLoved how someone was crossing a road and just vanished. \n\nTo shreds, nothing left. Not even dust.\n\nThey got A-Trained.\n\nWas about to comment, have to somehow also mod the wagons to make A-train's speed sound. That would be perfection to me.\n\nhit with Balefire\n\nTo shreds you say?\n\nAnd his wife?\n\nTo shreds, you say?\n\nReminds me of GTA Carmageddon mod\n\nYouTuber/Twitch streamer Tom Walker is currently playing through the whole story with this mod on and it’s hilarious\n\nThe best comment I saw on one of his uploads was “It’s the same joke over and over, and it’s always hilarious”\n\nThat's the first thing I thought. Tom needs to do a playthrough in RD2 with super speed horses\n\nIs that that same guy that did \"all NPCs are always drunk even in cutscenes\"?\n\nNo, that was Blurbs, who is the OP of this post\n\nOh. Awkward\n\nThere was also I believe GTA 4 where they modded the game to have negative friction. It was pretty funny.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/ifTIuA8Dq58\n\nWTF, I thought Saints Row was the only series with the \"Insurance Fraud\" side mission!\n\nOh lord my belly hurts what have you done! I always love this type of stuff, I'm wiping tears from laughter!\n\n[deleted]\n\nThis is amazing!! I love Doug Doug's chaotic streams and the random gta5 accelerator mod always cracked me up. Binge time!\n\nI came here looking for this LOL.\n\nI never get tired of this video LOL\n\nI remember hurting myself the first time I watched it and he shoved the large guy and he just started floating like he's in space.\n\nOk what the hell does \"negative friction\" even mean?  Is it just, like, the value the game uses to know how fast to slow your car when you let off the gas or whatever?  Meaning that cars instead speed up when the gas isn't pressed?  Wild.\n\nIts part of the physics engine in general I believe. Take for example you flip your car. Normally the game would calculate the friction of the top of your car and the road and cause that car to slow down. When you invert friction, now when your car rubs against the road it speeds up. Say you bump something and it moves slightly. Normally it will slow down because of friction, but with negative friction if you bump something slightly it will just keep accelerating as long as it is touching something that has a friction value. It causes a whole bunch of wacky things from what I recall.\n\nTo add to this, keep in mind that this is in the game engine, which is not real life.\n\nFor example, the tires on a car use friction to push you forward, but in a game engine, unless it's a simulator, friction probably isn't in the calculation of a vehicle's propulsion anywhere. Same with feet. So you basically have most friction working fine, because it's not friction — it's been abstracted away — and friction is only reversed anywhere someone actually decided to directly calculate it.\n\nTom Walker has a GTA 4 series where the cars are all going supersonic, it kills me every time he uploads a new video, but also it's kind of fascinating to see him figure out how to beat the missions under these circumstances https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65s6_9-Gh30\n\nHollywood Rollovers combined with Insane Traffic is a fuck ton of fun\n\nMy friend modded a GTA game to give golf carts super speed and be as durable as a tank. That was a lot of fun!\n\n\"Stop the wagon\" they said hopelessly as even the wagons driver was helpless to stop the super sonic stagecoach.\n\nhorror movie is right, imagine getting in your car to get out of there and zooming off\n\nHigh speed alligators would make me reinstall immediately\n\nOh man I'd just stand on a roof watching people get gobbled in the swamp\n\n“Gobbled in the swamp” sounds R-Rated.\n\nI mean I imagine it would be both with how it sounds and how it would look if a torpedo croc took you down like a scaled missile. They aren't kind to the things they chomp on.\n\nThis mod is what The Happening could have been. Should have been.\n\nOr make the wolves into the spiders from Satisfactory.\n\nThat's so hilarious lmao\n\nHow much horsepower per horse have you added?\n\nYes.\n\nAll of them\n\nCarmageddon has returned.\n\nKinda like that GTA4 mod that would make all cars have negative values for their tires adherance, giving pretty much the same result.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifTIuA8Dq58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifTIuA8Dq58)\n\n[There will be consequences!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSt1ptsOjL0)\n\nI did this mod to my game, it was hilarious.\n\nPlease tell me I can find a 10 minute youtube video compilation of this, I love random shit like this\n\nSure is!\n\nPlease share thy sacred knowledge so I can feast upon the treasure\n\nSearch op name in YouTube\n\nSource for the lazy: [https://youtu.be/14H_QpiPt8I](https://youtu.be/14H_QpiPt8I)\n\nHow did I not think of that, thank you!\n\nThis is what \"The happening\" movie should have been.\n\nALL YOU HAD TO DO WAS *stop the damn wagon* CJ!!!\n\nSomeone tell Tom Walker\n\nGlad I wasn't the only one lol\n\nI don't know what's worse: Being combo-juggled by half the vehicles of Liberty City, or being sniped by air-to-surface wagons.\n\nBut I know Tom would probably want to find out.\n\nIf he does this next I'm absolutely turning in.\n\nWins the internet for today.\n\nThis cured my Lumbago.\n\nErm sir you just won the internet, take my gold kind stranger.\n\nIf only I by chance had le Reddit Gold to give you, my kind sir. *tips fedora respectfully*\n\nWe're gonna have to go right to ludicrous speed!\n\nThey've gone plaid!\n\nThis is the kind of shit that converted me to PC gaming\n\nMade in Heaven?\n\n“STOP THE WAGON! I SAID STOP THE DAMN WAGON”😂\n\nLike bro so you see that shit flying around like a dragon how the fuck am I supposed to stop that\n\nPost this in /r/theregulationpod\n\nI was hunting for a reference to Regulation Podcast. Their GTA IV video is absolute gold.\n\nLaughed so hard, that I couldn't breathe.\n\nPaging Tom Walker....\n\nHaha (not real)\n\nIf you love this kind of thing go checkout a dude on YouTube called *tom walker* playing gta 4 with cars at 999% speed 😂😂😂\n\nSome absolutely excellently timed snipes from those cars, from angles previously thought impossible.\n\nThe best are when he's cartwheeling into orbit, still being hit by cars like they're homing missiles.\n\nFor those wondering, yes there's a full length video. I won't link it myself as to not anger the mods but it's not hard to find!\n\n[deleted]\n\nRootin' Tootin' Wagon Scootin'\n\nAverage day walking next to US roads\n\nWhen crossing streets in RDR2 is about to be a AAA version of Frogger\n\nThe kamikaze carriage is very funny\n\nSTOP THE WAGON!!!\n\nAll you had to do is follow the damn horse CJ!\n\n*Run Shadowfax. Show us the meaning of ha...aaaaaaahhhhh!!!!*\n\nMost mods I think ruin the original game, but some.....some do the other thing\n\nReminds me of editing vice city on my og xbox\n\nUnexpected Blurbs sighting. Will be observing your channel for the video 👀\n\nAlready live!\n\nGonna need sound to this. This is hillarious\n\nThere's a full video 👍\n\nAh, good old GTAIV carmageddon vibes\n\nThis is fuckin hilarious 😂😂\n\nCall Me Kevin just found his next video subject\n\nI needed to see this so much today. I’m crying I’m laughing so hard and how absurd this is. 😂\n\nModded RDR2 gave us the best youtube video I still have ever seen\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aj2Pt5vWT8\n\nI really needed this laugh! 🤣🤣🤣\n\nIf horror why I can't stop laughing?\n\n\"World's changin Dutch\"\n\nOMG 😂\n\nHorror game? Looks more like a comedy to me.\n\nDmn!\n\nThat is hilarios! I want to see more 🤣\nMake a Youtube Video pls\n\nMy key takeaway here is to stay off the fucking roads lol.\n\nYo! I love your content. I found you through your Text to Skyrim content, but I’ve been enjoying the hell out of your other content too.\n\n\"Made in heaven\"\n\nI Said, Stop The Dam Wagon\n\n*Stop the wagon!*\n\n*I said stop the damn wagon!* they said calmly.\n\nRed dead roadkill\n\nThis makes a good advocacy for speed control in urban areas ahah\n\nNew fear level unlocked\n\nYou really make me want to play this game now.  Also thank you for reminding me why I am a PC gamer\n\nThat's hilarious 😂\n\n“If ya ain’t fast, yer last”\n\nSend this to DougDoug immediately\n\ntom walker should play this\n\n“Stop the wagon!” And it’s just flying around his head like a bird! 🤣\n\nSomeone call Tom Walker. he's superstitious over cars already, I think we can get him afraid of horses too.\n\nShow us you riding it!\n\nwhere can we download your mod?\n\n“Stop the wagon!” \n\nI’m trying damnit.\n\nhow’s it work with deadeye?\n\nAnd I thought Tom Walker's gta4 run with no friction vehicles was funny as shit\n\nIs there an escort mission? This would be hilarious if you lost the mission for not keeping up but at the same time it arrived before you failed\n\nHey blurbs, nice to see you manage to do content past sot\n\nFinally some good news today.\n\nI can't stop laughing.\n\nWhy no sound?\n\nSonic the horse\n\n\"Stop the damn wagon! I said, stop the damn wagon!\"\n\nThis is like that GTA 4 mod\n\nReal horse power\n\nQuite possibly the dumbest thing I've seen.\n\nMore please!\n\nThat is fucking hilarious 😅\n\nI want this mod 💀\n\nYou magnificient bastard. This is the best thing I've seen all week.\n\n🎵Gotta go fast🎵 \n\n🎵Gotta go fast🎵 \n\n🎵Gotta go faster faster faster faster faster🎵\n\nLove the stuff you do, hate that this was created to highlight how creative your streams are and is only popping off after voting closed.\n\nTruly wish there was an entire section of twitch that exclusively had people actually playing games and experimenting with what they can do in the space as opposed to 739 react streamers"

    "all_comment_text": "Eternal Sonata hit me with that \"This ending is over 45 minutes long\" immediately after finishing the final boss.\n\nThat ending was wild. What a weird game. I loved it.\n\nWasn't they the game where you were Chopin in the middle of a fever dream?\n\nYes.\n\nThe only game that has successfully pulled off the \"it's all a dream\" plot.\n\nFF10?\n\nBloodborne was like 99% a dream or something\n\nYou're thinking of Bloodborne PC\n\n😭\n\n\"So here's an animated children's book about shapes and colors.\"  \n\"Wait, I thought... This is the ending...? There must be some mistake. *I* was playing a JRPG about Frederic Chopin...\"  \n\"...And you still are!\"\n\nI remember reaching the final dungeon of Eternal Sonata, and figured the game must be almost over.\n\nTurns out there was still at least 4 hours left of dungeon-crawling, minibosses, cutscenes, and multiple big boss battles to go. Ended up staying up well past midnight to finish it.\n\nHoly shit.. ive never met anyone else who has played that game. This comment is the closest I've come to knowing someone else who played it.\n\nAhh, another Eternal Sonata player? There are dozens of us! Dozens!\n\nI still have my Eternal Sonata XBOX 360 faceplate preorder bonus somewhere.\n\nLoved Eternal Sonata it is what made me love listening to Frederic Chopin's music.\n\nWhy haven't they re-released the game for the 3 of us!\n\nGod damn! Lol\n\nIirc the ending scene to MGS4 was like an hour and a half? Whole ass movie 🍿\n\n“This will take a while, make sure you are prepared”\n\n*proceeds to max level, get the highest upgraded gear possible, and get the maximum amount of support items*\n\n“Are you sure you want to continue, this will take a while”\n\n*proceeds to onesidedly destroy the final boss in 2 minutes*\n\nThat's more or less what I did because Like a Dragon Gaiden isn't exactly hard even if you aren't used to Yakuza games, but the warning was appreciated.\n\nIve only beaten a few Yakuza games, but those final missions always drag on to be 5 times longer than I think they'd be.\n\nA friend of mine and myself warn each other when we’re playing games with long cutscenes by saying they’re “Persona long” or “Yakuza long” \n\nThe cutscenes and the dialogue sometimes just never stops coming, which is fine if you have a heads up about it, but man when I’ve gotta make sure to nudge the controller so the screen doesn’t dim or the computer goes to sleep during a cutscene, it’s too damn long.\n\nWhat about \"MGS4 between acts\" long?\n\nMGS4 is the high standard for cutscene length. The ending after the last bit of actual gameplay is like an hour and a half long lol.\n\nThe original Xenosaga used to be my go-to example as the big offender of this. \n\nThen MSG4 came out lol.\n\nFuck I literally made almost this exact comment above. Xeno 1 was amazing though.\n\nhaha I did but I forgot MGS4 was even WORSE?! How can that even be. I must have skipped them at some point but I remember watching revolver ocelot hang out for 90 minutes or so\n\nSame for load times, watching Old Snake smoke a cig for 15 minutes while the PS3 uninstalled the previous chapter to install the next one. And I'm sure that process being built into the code is why they never ported it.\n\nI think they eventually gave you an option to preinstall all the chapters at once and it took like 25-30 minutes.\n\nI was trying to quit smoking last time I played it and that install screen made it *rough*.\n\n*an hour and a half??*\n\nCutscene? Mf THATS A MOVIE.\n\nThere are 7.5 hours of cutscenes in the game. MGS4 is multiple movies.\n\nDidn't mgs4 have a save point in one of the cutscenes because it was too long?\n\nAt least one, but I’m pretty sure there was more.\n\nXenosaga sure did.\n\nIt didn't really help.\n\nA dozen save points would have been better. Like chapter markers or something.\n\nSame for Yakuza. If you skip one cutcene you understand shit\n\nSwear if you skipped all the cutscenes you could beat the game In under 2 hours\n\nI literally fell asleep watching some cutscenes in MGS4 while playing late.\n\nMy sister and I took turns with the PS2 in the day, and I remember figuring I could knock MGS3 out with a solid push and the last 20 minutes of my round.\n\nI kicked off the last boss easy enough, sure enough.\n\nShe finally comes down and I just fucking GESTICULATE at Revolver Ocelot going \"I BEAT THE GAME AND THEY'RE *STILL TALKING*\"\n\nFucking love that game\n\nLmfao, that is a great visual, thanks for sharing.\n\nMakes me think of Metal Gear Solid 2, the game with scenes between the penultimate and final fights totalling in at about (iirc) 45 minutes.\n\nI remember the night I finished Metal Gear Solid 4, way back when it came out, I figured I could just play 10-15 minutes before bed. And then it turns out it was a 70 minute long cutscene.\n\nI had no idea what I was getting into. lol.\n\nNot just the length of them but how often they throw it at you as you try to complete a mission. 10 minute cutscene ends, 10 minute hallway battle, 5 minute cutscene, 10 minute battle against that rooms boss, cutscene of you kicking him through a door, 5 minute battle with the next room, then you reach another 5 minute cutscene, etc etc. These missions can go on for 30+ minutes with no save points. When you commit, you gotta commit. \n\n\nPlaying on platform with quick resume or quick suspend like Xbox or Steam Deck is nice, but I play Yakuza games on PC because these games are demanding and the newer made games look way better when maxed.\n\nI travel for work A LOT so I play on my steam deck.\n\nI’ve played Persona 5 royal and three yakuza games on many 3+ hour flights. For every one (I don’t learn) I took a gamble on cutscenes towards the end of the flight and am silently praying they’ll end as the landing gear extends so it doesn’t get fucked up with suspend.\n\n&gt; Not just the length of them but how often they throw it at you as you try to complete a mission.\n\nI might be remembering this wrong, but this was how I felt playing MGS4. \"Another cutscene? Ffs, I wanna do something!\"\n\n“Now that this 20 minute mission is over now I can kick back with my bucket of popcorn and watch a 3 hour long movie with zero intermissions”\n\nYou are definitely NOT misremembering. MGS4 has one cutscene that goes on for 71 minutes straight. Holds the world record still for it, I believe. The game in total has something like 8 hours worth of cutscenes. Insanity\n\nI remember back in the day when Metal Gear Solid 3 came out, I took my PS2 and the newly bought game - still in shrink wrap - to a friend's house. We wanted to check it out, play an hour, and then we had plans somewhere else, I don't remember. We weren't prepared for the intro with all the cutscenes and everything to be a solid 45 minutes. By the time we were handed the controls we were like \"okay, it's not worth playing anymore now\" and we feared the might be the next 30 minute cutscene right around the corner, so we stopped right there.\n\nAmazing game though.\n\nand then just when you think everything is finally wrapping up, a side character you thought was dead walks through the door and shoots your most sympathetic new companion through the heart. they smirk and reveal a whole second layer to the conspiracy, surprise it's gonna be another hour, and yes, you WILL be glowing and shirtless by the time we're done. I love Yakuza games so much.\n\nThe Yakuza games in general aren’t terribly difficult, but man, the Coliseum boss fights in Gaiden absolutely whooped my ass. I just went ahead and finished the game and never came back to them.\n\nFucking JUSTICE. I had to switch to the Chicken Man for his smg to kill the motherfucker.\n\nSome of them are tough for sure so I get it, even if I did beat them all.\n\nEvery Yakuza game warns you like this but it's especially funny in Gaiden because the whole ending sequence is like an hour long.\n\nIn some games (five) it's a genuine fraction of the runtime.\n\nI'm ready I have, 99 minor health potions, 99, health potions, 99 major health potions and 38 ultimate potions.... saved all for when the game gets difficult.\n\nEnd of game fight, uses 1 potion, didn't even need to.\n\n&gt; End of game fight, uses 1 potion, didn't even need to.\n\nStory of my life playing most RPGs\n\n\"oh yeah I forgot I have a ton of full heals/elixirs/etc., guess I'll use one to heal up my one character that lost a little health\"\n\nAlways hoarding for a rainy day and then end up never using any consumables lol\n\nYup the whole \"the game will get hard in a minute\" syndrome. Also, it's irritating, games shouldn't be standardised but those 2-3 games where potions are super limited have ruined us for every other game where they aren't.\n\nCan't remember the title atm, but I played a game that limited potion uses per fight.  You always started the fight full potions (say, 3) and you would use them because you couldn't hoard them.  It was a far superior potion implementation imo; you were still rewarded for not using them because you didn't lose the time/turn/whatever to do it, but if you needed them they were always there, no regrets.\n\nElden Ring is similar with the flask system that refills whenever you rest at a site of grace.  You can upgrade the number/strength of the flasks though and there are still other normal consumables for things.\n\n55 BURGERS 55 FRIES 55 TACOS 55 PIES 55 COKES 100 TATER TOTS 100 PIZZAS 100 TENDERS 100 MEATBALLS 100 COFFEES 55 WINGS 55 SHAKES 55 PANCAKES 55 PASTAS 55 PEPPERS AND 155 TATERS\n\nif you’re doing it any other way, you’re doing it wrong. lol bruh i have 100/100 refreshments of the sea king. come at me. \n\nalso pocket circuit is life.\n\n&gt; 100 refreshments of the sea king.\n\n#NANI?!\n\nmy bad! nourishment of the sea king!\n\n\"Uh, I found all 900 pinecones\"\n\n“….. I got all 900 pinecones…”\n\nThat was me at the end of Watch Dogs 2.\n\nSame, and with Watch Dogs: Legion lol. The second I could freely explore, I did literally everything except the main storyline. Then I played through the story mostly just over it at that point and wanting to be done\n\nI really wish Death Stranding did this before playing the entire LOTR trilogy at the end\n\nLengthy endings that go on for far longer than you thought possible is kojima's only ending across all his works.\n\nLove that crazy man\n\nUsed to be a running joke between my roommate and I in college. \n\nMGS4 had hilariously long cutscenes and the ending was basically a mini movie.  Loved every second though.\n\n&gt;  the ending was basically a mini movie.\n\nThe final cutscene is 71 minutes long - insane.\n\nwtf lol y’all were *not* exaggerating\n\nIt's an epilogue for the entire Metal Gear saga.\n\nIt legit felt appropriate and satisfying.\n\nThis is honestly either overselling it or underselling it. The ending of MGS4 is so insane that it makes the rest of the equally insane game almost instantly feel nostalgic. It wraps up plot threads no one needed wrapped up, it has a wedding no one asked for, if you count the short gameplay segment that comes before it has one of the dumbest twists of all time featuring a joke character that got elevated to main billing, Raiden's character is proverbially murdered, and Snake rides off with Otacon into the sunset like it's the finale of House. Just when you thought the midgame plot twist was possibly the dumbest thing you've ever seen the game just spends an hour straight dropping the ball in the funniest ways possible. \n\nIt was the only way Metal Gear could end. It was fantastic.\n\nYeah. As a fan of the series... yeah. If you want an actual good story, play MGS3. If you want a philosophical text, play MGS2. If you want weird goofy shit mixed with epic moments filled with characters that walk the line between stupid and awesome... play the whole series lol\n\nYeah, streamers were getting auto banned from Twitch when it came out because Twitch's algorithm thought they were showing a movie.\n\nYea theres seven hours of cutscenes in the entire thing\n\nHoly shit I need to get back in it again.. stopped at the time mules started using trucks.\n\nwhat the fuck lmao\n\nThe entire game just counting cutscenes alone is 7 hours long.\n\n  \nThat is *just* the cutscenes played one after the other, not including gameplay.\n\nI swear MGS4 was just a playable movie, but god damn it was fun.\n\nEven MGS1 started with you coming up in the docking port and music and literal credits rolling over the screen. I played that demo 999999 times hahaha\n\nMGS4 is the best movie I ever played\n\nThere are two full playthroughs of MGS4 on youtube, one is 14~ hours titled (full playthrough gameplay included) the other is 9 hours and is titled (cutscenes only)\n\nLol, there is like a full 1:15 minute movie at the end of that game.\n\n...and then the anxiety of 'will pressing the pause button actually pause the cutscene or will it skip the whole thing?'. Thankfully, a lot of games these days make you have to hold a button to skip, but I am still weary about this one.\n\nall games should have media player controls for cutscenes as an accessibility requirement\n\ni want to be able to rewind the cutscene!\n\nand the cutscene should have that Amazon Prime XRay shit where it tells you who is who in a scene in case you forget\n\nman cutscenes have really not evolved as much as they should have\n\nMeanwhile, No More Heroes 3 you can't pause (or skip?) the cutscenes at all! So I just uninstalled it as it was on game pass\n\nPlaying Ghost Of Tsushima on PC now and these  unskippable cutscenes are sapping my will to continue.\n\n\"There's no way you're taking Kairi's heart!\"\n\nAnd that they dont put you AFTER the cutscene if you die…\n\nMy buddy made dinner during one of the cutscenes of MGS4.\n\nI don't feel like checking to see if it's still the case, but at one point, MGS4 had the record for longest cutscene in a video game. \n\nI still remember the night I finished it. It was probably almost 2am, I had to work early, but I thought I was close to the end so I kept playing. Didn’t go to bed til about 5am that night.\n\nThat happened to me but with Snake Eater. That shit wouldn't end\n\nThis is about how it went with me. MGS4 is probably the last game I went absolutely feral over by getting it at midnight launch and beating it in around 24 hours (not including the several hours it took to install the game).\n\nSo by the time I was able to actually play, and begin my countdown until completion, was around 2-3am I think. I then went non-stop until about 2-3 am the next morning and that just barely got me to the ending after the final boss fight. So I still had all the cutscenes to follow.\n\nI think I got like an hour, MAYBE hour and a half, sleep until I had to get up and go to work. I really do miss the perseverance I had in my early 20s. There's absolutely no way I could do that today. Beat a game in 24 hours MAYBE, but certainly not proceed to take an hour power nap and immediately be at work.\n\nI'd have thought it was one of the xenosaga games. I'm pretty sure one has a 90+ minute cutscene somewhere.\n\nNow this is a playable movie. That intro to the first game was so boring but then it finally kicks in. And then you watch hour long episodes between 20 minutes of gameplay\n\n[deleted]\n\nThe opening cutscene of MGS3 is 23 minutes long lol\n\nThey gave you a warning already. It's when they put \"A game by Hideo Kojima\" on the box art.  \n  \nDeath Stranding absolutely rules, ending and all\n\nI fucking loved the ending so much. I really dig how they managed let the story go full circle. Really can’t wait for the sequel.\n\nThe end-game cutscene with Cliff in the hospital might take the cake for my favorite video game cutscene of all time.\n\nThe Die Hardman scene at the end? God, Tommie Earl Jenkins was acting his heart out for that one.\n\nOof yeah that one too, fucking Oscar-worthy\n\nWhen the game told to me travel all the way to the start I was like wtf but then realizing how far I came and how I don't actually have to walk it made it feel very rewarding\n\nWhat do you expect from a same dude who created MGS4 which holds World's Longest Cutscene in Video Game for 71 FUCKING minutes\n\nThe LOTR analogy works because in both cases you *think* you have hit the end, but of course not you still have half an hour to go, at least.\n\noh my god. i had blocked that out of my memory... i had to pee. and im like im sure its almost over...\n\nbeing able to pause a cut scene should be standard\n\nYou could pause the cutscenes in death stranding\n\nBut if you hadn't tried till then, I probably wouldn't risk trying it then either\n\nAh man, lucky me for getting to the \"last level\" after waking up really early like 4am for no reason on my day off, cuts to credits rolling at almost noon lol\n\npeople buy a kojima game and expect anything else, i say its on them\n\nWhen the ending cutscene in Death Stranding was starting to get long, I decided I was hungry, so I cranked the volume up and went in the kitchen and planned a dinner, then I cooked it, then I ate it. Then I came back to the TV and continued to watch the cutscene still playing... God damn.\n\nAnd then they explain stuff they already explained to you about 10 or 15 hours earlier in the game. As much as I enjoyed death Stranding and was hyped for it, the ending really wasn't great. Could have cut out 2 hours at least.\n\n\"Several cutscenes will play in sequence…\"\n\n\"It is recommended you set aside sufficient time to view these scenes in their entirety\"\n\n\"Make sure your mom ain't gonna beat your ass for not helping with the groceries\"\n\n[How to tell when shit is about to go down.](https://preview.redd.it/xg86q4o6gowc1.png?auto=webp&amp;s=7f30a52260dfbed5c6d87877dbf0a9279940a0c0)\n\nthis literally just gave me shivers because i remember this feeling exactly.  damn i cant wait for dawntrail.\n\nLove that FFXIV does this.  I think this was post-SB MSQ?  I enjoyed it more than SB itself.\n\nFirst time it happens is sitting down with the Sultana at the end of A Realm Reborn's quests in the leadup to Heavensward.\n\nI was not prepared. Watch like 45 minutes of cutscenes then take two steps and trigger another 20-30 minutes of cutscenes. It was never as bad after that one, but that warning gave me PTSD each time I saw it after.\n\nThat part was hype though, after an incredibly by-the-numbers by FF standards story in ARR, it suddenly starts getting progressively more apeshit until by the end everything is just  kinda fucked.\n\nI was fully on board with the length the whole time lol\n\nAs long as they hit me every so often with [MEANWHILE, IN THE IMPERIAL CAPITAL...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJNR00QQKWs) I'll sit through anything.\n\nBy the Twelve, I'm gonna miss those specific cut-ins. I fully expect Ishikawa and team to wrench our hearts like playdoh in Dawntrail and for Soken and team to smack us with banger tracks, but there's something iconic about \"AND HERE'S WHAT THESE BASTARDS ARE UP TO\" moments and them being actual evil bastards.\n\nThat textbox is my favorite character in the game.\n\nFFXIV Players: 'Oh boy, here I go taking emotional damage again!'\n\nWith a fight randomly in the middle.\n\nWhenever I see that line, I feel fear and trauma\n\n[Endwalker in a nutshell](https://i.redd.it/iykvwyciht481.png)\n\nFirst time I got hit with that I had a moment.\n\nIt's nice when a game _cares_ about not wasting player time. \"Hey, this is gonna be a bit, please make sure you've got the time.\"\n\nSo only 1 cutscene will play?..\n\nno, you get half an hour minimum with the Yakuza series\n\nRGG games have gotten better and better about letting you know when you're really in for it.\n\nCuz the older yakuza games were stupid easy if you had a bunch a health items since you could pause the game and spam the items in battle, now since they’re turn based it’s a little harder but you can still grind and get op gear/weapons early on and fuck everyone up til you hit a boss. I only lost a single battle in Like a Dragon 8 and it was a boss fight at the very end of the game\n\nLAD 7 had two bosses that absolutely bitchslapped me, requiring some leveling.\n\nWithout spoilers, it’s the two fights with characters from previous games, lol.\n\nOnly the fight against the two guys walled me. Grinded too hard and almost steamrolled everything else lmao. The difficulty spike in that fight is insane.\n\nYeah fighting S and M was when i spent like 15 hours over leveling in order to match them. After than I steamrolled the game lol\n\nTBF, you were essentially fightinh Living Legends at that point. The difficulty spike was more than justified IMO. Heck, that moment captured that feeling of fighting mythical figures even better than some of the best fantasy games I've played. Works both ways too:\n\n1. If you're a fan of the series, those two deserved nothing less.\n2. If LAD7 was your first Yakuza game, well now you're caught up. Those two are some of the most badass mofos in that setting and you got to experience it. No long prelude or exposition needed. They'll push your shit in and ask no questions later.\n\nYeah but the older ones also forced you to go find a payphone to even save, so despite the combat being easy the pain in the ass factor could be high, so more warnings like this would have been nice in the older entries.\n\nThe difficulty spike in the last couple of boss fights was pretty jarring. A one shot that makes you restart the fight that takes 20+ minutes is not fun lol\n\ni found yakuza 0 incredibly easy, even on hard, so i never once bought any health items. unfortunately that bit me in the ass when i did the final fight, because that was actually hard. by the time i made it to the last boss i was completely out of healing. i actually had to load an old save so i could go buy healing items and then i redid the entire thing.\n\nand your journey has begun!\n\ni'm up to 5 now lol.\n\nFFXIV is pretty good about this, letting you know the next cutscenes is loooong\n\nExactly what I thought of haha. The end of each expansion is like an hour long movie it's great.\n\nBy \"long\" it really means looooooooooooooooooooooooong. Even the bread and butter duty/dungeon that takes around 30 minutes has half of it filled with unskippable cutscene.\n\nWhat game is this?\n\nLooks to be Like a Dragon Gaiden. Great series!\n\nEnding absolutely ruined me.\n\nI've showed that cutscene to 4 different friends who have no interest in playing the series and all 4 of them cried, and I cried every single time I showed it to people.\n\nYeah. I was anticipating a different ending altogether, a happy one, not a tiger drop to the feels.\n\nThe hardest I've ever cried to a piece of media\n\nit is! and it is!\n\nI am once again asking this goddamn subreddit to make a rule stipulating the game name in the post’s title.\n\nIt used to be a rule, but they probably just gave up trying to enforce it\n\nTerrible when people don't mention what game is it. I complained to mods about it, but they absolutely refuse to enforce a rule that name of the game be mentioned in the post.\n\nIt fucking sucks. It's like they want the attention of people asking them about the game.\n\nYou can right click &gt; *Search Image with Google* in Chrome. It will help you 99% of times.\n\nIf in Firefox, right click image &gt; Copy Image. Open Google Image Search and \"Control V\"\n\nMy first thought was \"too bad this post doesn't respect my time.\"\n\nYoud have thought the OP going on about respect would actually name the game they are posting. Right?\n\nYea, it's 2024 and idiots still not putting the game in the title.\n\n[deleted]\n\nI know FF14 does this as well, warning you about a long series of cut scenes and or dialogues.\n\n&gt; Upon proceeding, several cutscenes will play in sequence.  \n&gt; It is recommended that you set aside sufficient time to view these scenes in their entirety.\n\nYou know things are about to get serious whenever you get this warning.\n\nAh yes, \"multiple cutscenes will play in sequence.\"  A notice to strike terror into the heart of any FFXIV player, and of any other game's player who is faced with a similar warning.\n\nThat reminds me of Warframe **NEW WAR** questline kinda did this thing too, I was like \"Pfff ... How long can it be\" and oh boy I was wrong ....\n\nI love it when games tell you how close you are to the endgame.\n\nSpider-Man Remastered and Miles Morales tell you to upgrade your equipment and perks (and save your game) before you start the last chapter.\n\nIs this (Lost) Judgment, Gaiden or Infinite Wealth? r/yakuzagames\n\nGaiden. Or otherwise known as Like A Dragon: The Man Who Made You Cry Your Fucking Eyes Out.\n\nso is it like a dragon gaiden or yakuza like a dragon?\n\nLike a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name.\n\nAfter Yakuza 6 the series rebranded the subsequent games to “Like a Dragon,” which matched what the games were called in Japan.\n\n“Gaiden” means “side story/tale,” which implies an offshoot.\n\nWe generally call it Gaiden for short, the story is a bridge between Yakuza 6 and Like a Dragon (Yakuza 7 in all but name) and smaller in scope than the other massive games. Kind of like Spider-man: Miles Morales. It *mostly* doesn’t directly continue the main story, but fills in critical gaps that explain what the former protagonist has been up to. \n\nI hope that clears up the admittedly confusing naming conventions.\n\nit's Gaiden\n\nPsychonauts is king here. It gives a \"Warning: Point of No Return\" text box, stating...well, that it's a point of no return, and that proceeding will make it impossible to return to a major area of the game. It tells them to stock up on items from the store before it closes, and to deal with any unfinished business before moving on--very appreciated, as there's a game-long scavenger hunt that the player's likely to be about to finish.\n\nWhat makes it king, though, is that it does something unique to the era: It autosaves. Specifically, it *duplicates* your save--right before the Point of No Return. So, if you ignore the warning, play on, save, and realize you've martyred yourself with your own hubris, you *do* have the option to go back. I mean, unless you specifically also deleted the dupe save, in which case fool me once, fool me twice, fool me chicken soup with rice.\n\nI just adore redundancies and failsafes in PNR states in games. Polar opposite of opening a chest once in life in FFXII and it invisibly removing the coolest weapon because I don't know.\n\nMe ignoring that warning in Like a Dragon\n\nTwo hours later… still going!\n\nYakuza LaD's ending is so good, holy shit\n\nI finally beat Portal 1 last night, did it all in one sitting. I told my girlfriend about 20 minutes into the last level \"I'm almost done, this puzzle is just a little bit harder.\"\n\nNot realizing the last level is like half the game.\n\nportal is god tier gaming.\n\nFFXIV had these and they were not a fucking joke. Sometimes you were settling in for a short film.\n\nGames that just jump you into the endgame without warning or a clear save beforehand is more frustrating than boss fights that you're supposed to lose and they don't tell you.\n\nWhat games this?\n\nYakuza series. Game specifically is Like a Dragon: The Man Who Erased His Name. if it looks at all interesting, keep an eye out for a Yakuza Zero sale. the start of an amazing journey.\n\nZero is usually cheap even not on sale... well worth it for the amount of content you get.\n\nFor me, any game that gives a \"this is the point of no return so finish up anything else before proceeding\" message is simply operating at a higher level as it respects the  player and the want to finish up the game the way the player wants to.\n\nHow I wish the first warning was on Legend of Zelda Tears of the Kingdom.\n\nThe moment you go down the depth to find Ganondorf, you ain’t gonna come back!\n\nThats my one like when it comes to endgame RGG games\n\n  \nThe game downrights tell you that this is the final showdown of the game, so get cozy, start to grind XP and money to stack up to the final boss, finish all of the substories that you left pending, and there no point of return unless you have a old save\n\n  \nMany other games usually just tell you that beyond this misison onwards there will be nothing else to do besides doing the final mission\n\nIs square enix the first to put these kind of direct warnings in games? Several say things like \"Once you continue you can't return, please finish any outstanding quests\", but FF14 is the first that I'd seen literally say \"Several cutscenes will play in sequence. Please set aside sufficient time to watch them in their entirety\".\n\nThe best part is sometimes \"suffcient time\" is like 15 mins other times its a fucking hour+\n\nYou just never know... lol\n\nJudgment literally tells you to go sleep and eat first\n\nIt's a cool thing for all Yakuza/LAD games because their finales can last from 2 ~ 5 hours.\n\nAkame be like - JORYU!!!!\n\n\"Several cutscenes will play in sequence....\"\n\n*Final Fantasy XIV* does the same thing. \"If you proceed, multiple cutscenes will play out one after the other. Please make sure you have time and snacks set aside to fully enjoy these cutscenes.\", or something like that.\n\n[deleted]\n\nPS1 RPGs would do the opposite of this to push you to the cutscenes as long as possible and then throw a curveball in combat to kill you and make you rewatch the cutscenes as many times as possible\n\nI get the intention but boy does that kill immersion for me. Besides I don't play unless I've got time to burn.\n\nAnd then there's Metal Gear Solid with hour and a half cutscenes\n\nThis is something I've only seen Japanese games do. Some titles might vaguely hint at a point if no return or something but shit like FF14 will explicitly state \"Hey dude you're about to watch an hour of cutscenes, go take a piss or log out if you don't have the time.\"\n\nHonestly i’m actually kind of the other way around - i don’t like it when a game tells me I’m about to begin the final chapter, it feels so spoilery.\n\nI’d rather just have a game be setup where there’s convenient checkpoints or savepoints all throughout so i don’t even need to be bothered with setting aside a long enough gaming session.\n\n\"Be advised. You have work at 9am. Your team lead will most likely forget his half of the presentation, so you probably need to be at work by 8:30.\n\nAlso, Timmy has practice at 3:00, should be done by 5:00 the latest. Don't forget to pick him up from school.\n\nIt's Whopper Wednesday, so we're having Burger King for dinner. I hope that's OK. \n\n\nThis is the last chance to purchase items. Do you wish to proceed?\"\n\nI played numerous online games, specifically free-to-play games like Genshin Impact, before switching to offline games.\n\nFor some reason, I find offline games more respectful of my time than online games.\n\n&gt;For some reason, I find offline games more respectful of my time than online games.\n\nTruly a mystery for the ages.\n\naren't online games specifically made to drain your time and/or money?"

Thank you.\n\nThey tried to change weapons :(\n\nlol\n\nThanks man, I bursted out laughing and I am in a meeting\n\nWaiting for GTA6\n\nProbably each other\n\nI hope so finding love through gta would be the best thing to happen from that dog shit gsme\n\nMet the love of my life playing GTA RP servers, 3 years strong so far. Good things can come out of those hellhole servers\n\nThat’s awesome! My wife and I would run around in the smaller ps3 servers when it first launched back in college. It’s not why we ended up together - but it didn’t hurt.\n\nDifference is RP servers are tame and controlled (unless non whitelisted), the official vanilla gta servers public sessions are just pure chaos and unfun.\n\nDon't know why you're getting downvoted. I played vanilla GTAO for years on the Xbox and 9 times out of 10 there was at least 2 fights going on and 1 of them always involved a jet bike or something. \n\nThen my first online session on pc was madness\n Dudes spawning in money for other people. People still trying to kill each other. Had a hacker turn into a monkey and then a stripper dance all over my characters face. Pure fucking chaos\n\nAhh, this is cute. You guys are couple goals. I wish you the best of luck, and it's nice to know something good can come from those crazy nasty servers\n\nOh come on, that one mission was pretty good.\n\n...until they ruined it\n\nSorry I should have clarified I meant the gta online aspect the story is great\n\nThe story is great, until the end. The end is just a big fat \"that's it???\"\n\nTo be honest, GTA's always kinda just... End. Great stories and acting and all that, but the endings almost always leave you with this weird hollow feeling where you just stare at the screen and say: \"huh, well that's it I guess 🤷\" but yeah GTA 5 is probably the worst example of that.\n\nWhich is weird since the 3D trilogy had kinda epic final missions (III, Vice City, San Andreas) that were pretty crazy levels in themselves.\n\nI agree. The concepts for the final missions are usually great, but still somehow the games just end on a weird note. Even GTA 5. You get revenge on all of the bad guys you've encountered through the story. Awesome! \n\nBut why doesn't it feel like a satisfying ending though!? 😫\n\nYeah, but the weird part is that there's a heist near the end that felt like a climax to me. It's long, complicated and it feels like a \"one last job\". They could have tied that heist and the ending together for nice big payoff. Instead there's a gap and the ending feels like a whimper.\n\nSheesh, the opinions of this game sure have changed over the years.\n\nHappy cake day!\n\nThey’re set to get married on the GTA 6 release date. They’re also prepared to have multiple back up plans in case it gets pushed back a time or 10.\n\nand how much of this did you make tf up?\n\nSomewhere between all of it and every last fucking bit of it.\n\n🤣 I honestly don't know if they're question was genuine, but this answer seems suitable if it was a genuine question.\n\nNot much of it. Unfortunately a lot of game releases get pushed back.\n\nThe day before actually. Having the ceremony on the day would prevent them from playing it, that's planned for their honeymoon.\n\nAfter their beautiful reunion they spent two happy years together as friends killing prostitutes and running airplanes into unsuspecting bikers.\n\nSource: me.\n\nOh they fuckin\n\n100%\n\nJudging by the looks on their faces they might have been at it already lol\n\n&gt; \"Believe it or not, straight to jail.\"\n\n[They actually have a video of that too.](https://youtu.be/iJiQsEZXz_8?t=38)\n\nmoments after the photo they got sideswiped by a 13 year old driving a mustang who got it sideways going around that corner. 13 year old was quoted after \"i fucker your fat momma bitch!\"\n\n25 to life.\n\nInternet can be a cool place.\n\nMy partner was playing COD way back in day, and was chatting with these random two kids (brothers) his age in the lobby. They were talking about plans and stuff. Partner mentioned his high school orientation the next day. They had theirs too the next day. They were going to generic catholic school name. Turned out to be the same school. \n\nOne of them was just at my house on Sunday after camping with my partner. The others becoming a dad in the winter and having a shotgun wedding.\n\nHa, I love this thread! Met a friend 15 years ago in a COD lobby. He’s been my husband’s best friend ever since. He helped my husband land his dream job, as the two of them play video games for a living.\n\nAw this is so sweet. I met my best friend 10 years ago, my gang found him in DayZ tied him up and forced him to participate in a boxing match for his life against other bambies. He was the winner. The rest is history 🥲\n\nI’m 42, been with the same woman for 22 years, we’re getting married in less than 3 weeks. \n\nFlying out to Miami for a cruise for my bachelor party. There will be 2 friends from gaming on the cruise and a third hanging out in Miami for the night, he’s one of my oldest “online friends”. We’ve hung out before. I met him on IRC over 25 years ago. \n\nAt my wedding there will be an additional 4 couples flying in with whom I talk to every day on discord. I just went to one of their weddings last year. I’ve met them all IRL a few times now. These are all some of my best friends. I’ve known them all for years and years. Can’t imagine life with out them. Crazy to think I wouldn’t have any of them without the internet.\n\nI was very active in starcraft online back in the day and had a few users I played with pretty consistently. One of them mentioned the city they lived, which was the specific ~25,000 person town I lived in.  Being a tween girl, I was trained to never ever admit my location, so I stayed quiet. But I was very active in the community later in life and always wondered if I ran into him lol.\n\nI miss some of my Internet buddies. 10ish years ago I played Minecraft with some cool dudes. We made vids together and played games all day. It was a time when I had very little friends and especially friends that played games. I'm sure they all turned out to be great people but one day we just all never hopped on Skype and we never used steam back.\n\nOk, I gotta ask; what's a shotgun wedding? \n\nThe two pictures in my head are either everyone brings a shotgun and shoots a salute or the groom found his wive with the shotgun principle (asking random women until one says yes).\n\nOh my god I feel old. Someone hasn’t heard of a shotgun wedding? Wild times.\n\nIt basically just a very rushed marriage and commonly used to describe a quick wedding after finding out the bride is pregnant (typically not planned).\n\nI guess it's more a language barrier or cultural thing. Anyways, thanks for the explanation.\n\nThe idiom derives from the notion of the father of the bride using a shotgun to convince the groom to make his daughter an \"honest woman\" and marry her\n\nMy brother actually met his current girlfriend on a GTA 5 RP server. They dated long distance for a couple of years before she moved all the way from the north east to down south, now they have an apartment together.\n\nAlways thought that was super cool and I've always been really happy for him, glad to see its not as uncommon as one would think.\n\nMy last ex ended up moving from Ontario Canada to Florida and marrying a guy that we played fucking call of duty with.\n\nWhen they added the battle royale mode called blackout that eventually became warzone, we were doing shitty, and I was like hey this is some cool new shit, you might actually like this. We can play it together. And I bought a second copy and put it on her computer. And we played it a ton. This dude joined one day. \n\nAnd then that happened.\n\nI shit you not. \n\nFuck my life lol.\n\nBest wingman ever\n\nBut fr im sorry that happened\n\nFound my GF of 3 years on 4chan's /soc/ board....\n\nJoke in my friend group is I cucked the entire soc board because I took the only sane woman.\n\nI met one of my gfs on /b/ back in the mid 2000s.  \n\nYou can imagine how that played out.\n\nOh it definitely is as uncommon as one would think. This is just such a massive website that things start to seem more common than they are. Especially considering this picture is 9 years old. Still awesome though.\n\nRedM and FiveM are much smaller worlds than regular GTAO and RDO and these situations are not that uncommon there. I play on a large RedM server and there are plenty of relationships that start as RP and move into the real world. There’s also a very shady side where people use RP to find someone to cheat on their partner/spouse emotionally and/or physically. Unfortunately there is A LOT of mental illness in these communities.\n\nI preferred the rp servers on gta san andreas. No mics = less creepy. Plus back in that day the rp servers didn’t attract literally everyone. (We’re talking +/- 2012-13) got myself thousands of hours in those.\n\nMany people meet their partners through hobbies, makes sense that it'd happen through gaming as well. I've seen many stories of \"oh I met my wife playing WoW\" or some other game.\n\nI met my boyfriend in FFXIV :D LDR for a year, living together for over 3. In our free company/guild we also had a couple who met in WoW. 2 more couples formed in our guild, but broke up.\n\nMet my wife playing EverQuest Online Adventures for the ps2. Been together 20+ years now. Gamer love been a thing for a loooong time. Grats to you and yours.\n\nI met my wife playing pacman on a cocktail machine in my pediatric dentists waiting room. And by met my wife I mean met my love of games.\n\nAnd by playing, I mean not playing, and just thinking I was playing, but it was just the auto demo.\n\nWait till you learn about twitchTV.\n\nCongratz to you too! :D Gamer love stories have been one of my favorite things to see/read about for ages!\n\nJust married my husband (!!!! :D) after meeting on FFXIV about 6 years ago. Moved countries to be with him :)\n\nYes, I moved too! Best decision I've ever made! And congratulations!!! :D\n\nTo be fair, I think Final Dating Simulator Drama Fantasy XIV could be an outlier.\n\nLol my mom was in an elite WoW guild where the leaders were married, after meeting on WoW, and they got a divorce and it completely tore the guild apart in the most dramatic way.\n\nI also met my girlfriend in FFXIV! We did LDR and I moved to be with her!\n\nMy parents met on a text-based MMO in the mid nineties.\n\noh, wow, Arik and Maria had kids?!\n\nMet my wife in WoW. Have been together since Burning Crusade, even have kids together too.\n\nWhen I played WoW I knew many couples that had met each other in the game. Not me though...\n\nI saw a bunch of people get married too! A giant migration of nerds finding love\n\nAbout a third of my raid guild married each other.\n\nonline communities are an extremely common place for relationships to start lol, i'd bet most long distance ones start through that these days and those ain't uncommon in the slightest.\n\nMy best friend and I played Little Big Planet as kids and met a boy from the US. We were good online friends for years. And then during Covid she moved there and now they have a baby!\n\nOne of my best friends has had a GF for over 2 years without telling anyone and me and my wife got super happy when we asked him if he was looking for someone special and he told us he already had someone. We are from Sweden and she is from Panama. They met in a Nintendo Switch game called Overcooking. They meet up in different countries 4 times a year when they take vacation at the same time, super cute! Since he works in IT i think he will move to Panama soon enough since he can work remote and if he does I will miss him so much, but I am so happy for him regardless..\n\nA guy I worked with for a while, met his wife/mother of his child on League of Legends. He moved to Vegas from Sacramento, then after a year there, they moved to my town, into their own home (her mother lives here). Pretty cool story. Love can be found anywhere.\n\nI know someone who met their spouse on Farmville. They were friends of friends and one of them was going on vacation and needed someone to take care of their Farmville stuff while they were away and sent a message out that was forwarded to a few times. They eventually met irl and she moved to England and now is a citizen there. Even her grown son from a previous marriage basically went to high school and university in England.\n\nI met my best friend through a webcomic but with the distance and my disabilities I don't know if I'll ever get to meet him in person...\n\n9 years worth of reposts for this image.\n\nIt’s still shocking to me that a female character in GTA actually turned out to be a real female in real life.\n\nPlot twist: he was actually the blond girl in game\n\nAlot of the women who do have female characters probably don't play publically or are very quiet or play with friends.\n\nIts just a universal thing with women and gaming. Theres still alot of nasty shit being said and done to them just because they so happen to be women. Its gotten better over the decade though.\n\nBecause now you get to see the women become like 2009 Modern Warfare 2 lobbies in shit like Apex or Valorant :P\n\nYeah like, I bet a big reason why they became friends was because he just acted normal and treated her like anyone else. That's all it takes. It's a low bar that many gamers consistently fail to reach.\n\nWhen I was big into Killing Floor I always made sure there wasn't an ounce of info on my steam profile that could ID me as a woman. Was just not worth the shit. A male friend of mine openly accused me of 'exaggerating' and I made him watch me play a round of CSGO deathmatch with mic on - and it took minutes before someone responded to me using voice chat in the exact same way as the rest of the team for someone to follow me around asking me my bra size.\n\nYep. This right here. I played ESO and WoW hardcore back in the day. I started solo playing and hiding in plain sight because there were too many mental midgets who acted like they have never seen or talked to a girl before.\n\nNo lie, playing GTA online as my major introduction to online multi-player gaming put me off of it for an extra several years. \n\nI had such an intensely bad experience with creeps. I had more than one guy start following my avatar around even though I wasn't using a mic because they \"suspected I might be a real girl\". \n\nIt wasn't until 2020's Phasmophobia trend that I gave online voice games a chance again.\n\nYeah there are games out there that suck for women because of how many creeps there are or assholes.\n\nSo far games like Deep Rock, Warframe, MWO (kinda) and some others have some pretty decent communities and Devs who WILL ban players who act unsavory.\n\nAnd I say MWO because its mostly middle aged men and some older women. The issue is that its **Middle aged men** so some could be unsavory. Or drunk.\n\nAnd then Warframe is still mostly nice. You get a bit more assholes now a days but Digital Extremes takes no shit from unsavory players.\n\nThis is especially true in GTA online, the games community is one of the dumbest I’ve seen. Even beyond all the hatred it’s a lot of people being fed that YouTube clickbait and expecting the game to just be full of cars and planes and nothing else.\n\nProps to you for the username btw lol\n\nYep I’m a girl that plays in solo lobbies only after too many bad experiences! Thankfully Rockstar has added lots of excellent solo content recently.\n\nI play with a female character, but don't use open chat, I just chat with the friends I'm playing with as things get weird when you talk in game. \n\nAs soon as they hear a female voice, you either get dudes camping to kill you, stalking you around the game, harassing you, or refusing to do heists or activities with you because they assume you can't play.\n\nTry FiveM\n\nYeah, there is no way in hell am I’m letting anyone in a game know I’m a real woman but I am!\n\nWait, you saying 2015 was 9 years ago...!? Damn. I feel like I'm missing a 4 year Covid chunk of my time line...\n\nThere was a post yesterday on r/WoW of a dude saying he felt nostalgic for the Legion expansion bc he was a kid in those days. That expansion was released in 2015.. \n\nNice way to make us all feel old\n\nI wonder if that is what it feels like when you spend several years in prison.\n\n[deleted]\n\n*They've been in witness protection, they still are.*\n\nWitness protection for what? No one was convicted of anything! /s\n\nThat made me rethink my life! 👀\n\nAwwwww this is super wholesome\n\nNeat when this type of thing happens and it all goes well.\n\nMy friend and I met through GTA online as well! Back in… 2013. We STILL haven’t met in person but there was a point when we were talking on the phone and/or gaming every night for ages. \n\nI’m hoping to finally do it next year since I bought an Rv and am gonna be living in it but we’ll see\n\nNow i wanna know stories when it goes very not well\n\nIs that Santa Monica pier?\n\nYeah. It's eerie how similar the GTA recreation is. \n\nI was just there the other day and the building across the street is my garage in GTAOnline lol\n\nOne of my buddies was in California a year or so ago and he sent a pic of a weird intersection and joked about how he always wrecks in GTA at that spot. \n\nI know the spot is near Franklin’s aunts house\n\nThere's a lot of iconic LA scenery I only recognize because of its recreation in Los Santos. As I watch movies that take place in LA, I only recognize the city because of the foundation GTA established.\n\nI wonder if GTA has altered the property values of some random real life locations lol\n\npretty sure Santa Monica's value is not dependent on being featured in a videogame lmao\n\nIt's where a lot of LA area jobs are. It's one of the few places where public schools are good. The air is clean and not too hot in the summer. It used to be low crime (until the bums multiplied exponentially the last few years). It's very walkable -- there's a reason Whitey Bulger picked SM as the place to live when he was on the run -- and you can get everywhere in the city on a bike. It has like four whole foods and three Trader Joe's.\n\nWalking by bums by the promenade and that grass area by the overlook has been a staple for at least 20 years.\n\nyes\n\nevery time I see those colorful houses off the PCH in Santa Monica (aka the Oppenheimer and Barbie houses), I just think of Dr Friedlander. that shithead psychologist lives next to them\n\nNo it's Del Perro\n\nW gaming moment\n\nLet me guess: the first picture is from real life\n\nThe second is unreal engine 5.\n\nHe lucked out, coulda been another dude that looks just like him but white.\n\nIt’s funny, to me, their avatars are both skinnier.  Mine would be too, just funny\n\nCan you even play a fat avatar in GTAO?\n\nI dont think so, no. Pretty sure everybody has the same body shape and you can only customize the face.\n\n[deleted]\n\nYea, the GTA avatars looks like they’d share some in game needle together\n\n[deleted]\n\nI once met a girl on GTA V and she sent me pictures of her butthole. It was awesome.\n\nGTA. The gateway drug to butt hole pics\n\nSo bummed that Santa Monica pier isn't more interactive. Doesn't even have the carousel or arcade\n\nA real life Ready Player One!\n\nDouble catfish. Those are rare.\n\nNot GTA but I was playing another extremely niche game (Dark Age of Camelot), me and this bloke had been grouping together for years, knew of each other through various circle.\n\n\nAnyways, we were on vent one morning (showing my age) and I heard a crash outside on the road, so did this bloke. Started describing and it was the same crash we had both heard, to cut a long story short, we lived on opposite sides of the road to each other, had no idea either of us existed or even mentioning where either of us were from, he was the elder brother of someone I went to school with. We ended up playing games for a few years before real life on my end ended up me tailing off, no idea where he is at these days. \n\n\nFunny old world. \n\nPretty cool though\n\nYou can make an avatar of anything you want. Anything you want to be you can be it in this game. \n\n- Makes self\n\nCute but lost opportunity to dress like their characters. 7/10\n\nI mean it’s kinda close\n\nI dress my character like such a hoe, and I don’t have the body for it irl\n\nAt least they Both were fatter in real life\n\nGot a little aspirational with the character creator\n\nGTA doesn't allow for fat characters unless you use a pre-made PED model.\n\nSource: I play GTA RP and am upset I can't make a full on self insert.\n\nLoved my first playthru of saints row 3 cuz you can just be fat fuck on a rampage. Everything I've ever wanted.\n\nMutual Catfishing\n\nCuter in real life.\n\nEdit: More cute and more handsome, I believe that's the better English way to say it, lol\n\n[deleted]\n\nIRL camera adds a few pounds\n\nNOW KITH\n\nLove this, kinda wholesome esp considering we are talking about GTA here 😂\n\nand if i tried it all I'd get is one less kidney\n\nThats actually kinda cute\n\nAlmost a decade ago, but that's dope. So wholesome.\n\nI’m sorry, I don’t believe this, nobody becomes friends in GTAO, they just fly around on jet motorcycles blowing each other with homing missles.\n\n[Everyone likes that]\n\nA sad note, Take Two and Rockstar sued them for copyright and IP infringement a week later.\n\nGaming brought a few friends to me, though i never did meet em in person. Sabre, you were a firefighter from Buffalo, NY. My HS friends from WV played Siege with you back in 2016, if you’re reading this I hope you’re doing well!\n\nAlso, Taco! You were a 12 year old prodigy that became our college crews 5th man for Siege, I hope school is going well and you’ve mellowed out a bit (we were all just as rambunctious at your age, don’t worry)\n\nI hope they never become criminals.. they had enough practice together.\n\nI've played GTA SA/ V tour guide when gamer family or friends visit me in LA.\n\nThat's pretty great. I got to meet one of my gaming buddies when I studied abroad, it was kind of surreal.\n\nThis totally rules.\n\nI have seen a couple couples that met from FiveM(modded GTA Servers for Roleplay) that wound up getting married IRL\n\nGotta thank Rockstar for bringing people together.\n\nits cool their avatars are kinda like them\n\nI mean, one was sorta close in appearance?\n\nYo... Is that dude Grove street?\n\nGreat story. Reminds me of Ready Player One.\n\nShut up. I love this so fucking much.\n\nThis is so awesome!!\n\nSeriously!!!\n\nwhat da hellll\n\nGod damn, that game is OLD\n\nRobbed a liquor store and he pimped her\n\nthis is like 9 years ago right? wonder how these two are doing in life nowadays...\n\nGreat\n\nI met my best friend of 12+ years while roleplaying within the Mass Effect Universe and we’re playing still.\nAlso met my boyfriend through RP on MMORPGs :)\n\nA guy I used to work with met a girl on a GTA V custom server. They're engaged and have a child!\n\nWholesome\n\nI bet this has been posted 2015 times\n\nThis is beautiful. Also anyone want to take over a server this weekend?\n\nWait! That online avatar of a woman was actually a woman? What are the odds?\n\nThis is actually pretty cool lol\n\nThey both catfished each other\n\nThis made my day\n\nSo cute!\n\nit's funny how they're both skinny in the game but not irl lol\n\nI don’t think you can change weight in gta online.\n\nNot that funny considering GTAO doesn't even let you make a fat character.\n\nLove that they're both the same amount of overweight in real life relative to their in-game characters."

It has only now occurred to me, 13 years later. That it actually makes sense I had to craft hundreds of daggers to be able to have the skill to make the better stuff.\n\nForged in Fire really gave me great prospective.\n\nI've actually watched a lot of blacksmithing stuff. Like many gamers Man at Arms on YouTube from a few years ago was a great introduction. Then I watched a bunch of Forged in Fire, then one of the dues from the show (Asian dude, forget his name) watched a bunch of his YouTube stuff, Ilya from Man at Arms a bunch of his own stuff too, Alec Steele from here in the UK, a bunch of non talking stuff including the dude with the fancy teas whose channel I can no longer find.\n\nAnd though all of that, even though I have seen what goes into it and have an admiration for the craft, though all of that never did it occur to me how much sense Skyrims blacksmithing skill made\n\n[removed]\n\nI wish... Most is self taught or through work\n\nAt 5-6lbs and top-heavy, is it actually maneuverable, or does it swing like a crowbar?\n\n[One does not come to Skyrim for reasonable weapons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcsLd3dVNz8)\n\nSomehow knew it was Skallagrim before I clicked the link lol\n\nMy thoughts exactly.\n\nThat really depends on the person trying to swing it!\n\nThis is fookin sick dude.\n\nMad props.\n\nSeriously, this axe is sexy as hell and looks badass. \n\nLike it would cut you for staring at it for too long.\n\nWell done\n\nCurrently I only made one. But I made a ton of other Elder Scrolls arms and armor. But I am getting some traction now and want to build a steel mace and a daedric bow\n\nDaedric bow would be awesome. Always been my favorite.\n\nOG player detected, this hasn't worked for years\n\nI mean, it would wouldn’t it? There’s just more efficient ways. \n\nThe diminishing returns are so intense that the amount of daggers needed is vastly beyond what's worth your time. You *could*, yeah, if you're really dedicated to it.\n\nAre there better ways?\n\nYeah building more complex stuff is worth more and building simpler stuff is worth less. I don't know what the most efficient meta game choice is but the intention is for you to be crafting the most difficult pieces you currently understand and then selling them. I'd imagine dwarven stuff is probably in the sweet spot cause it's advanced enough to be valuable for the whole game but simple enough to be accessible by most players with any crafting intention\n\nYeah, jewelry like gold rings, once you get to 30, dwarven bows, and 70 you can improve the dwarven bows with an additional ingot on the grindstone. Since you get dwarven metal for free from the ruins it is very cost effective and very plentiful. Can buy a bunch of leather needed for so many bows \n\nPlus you can get you follower to pick up tons of dwarven metal super early on.\n\nThere is a shit ton of dwarven \"ore\" as well, but I think the update made it work according to value, making jewelry the best way to level up. There is also the transmute spell which turns iron and silver into gold.\n\nTransmute and jewelry is my go to for leveling blacksmithing.\n\nDiamond necklaces. One flawless diamond, one gold ingot. Bethesda will allow item duplication now, so you can duplicate all the items you need. Duplicate out about 300 flawless diamonds, and 300 gold ingots. Make 300 gold diamond necklaces, (That will max out your smithing.) Then you go enchant those 300 necklaces with fortify health and fortify healing rate and that *should* max out enchanting. Then you need to find some other enchantments, you need muffle and if you don't get it early you don't get it, so make sure you scoop that up when you see it. Then you need fortify Alchemy. You need a falmer helmet, an unenchanted circlet, an unenchanted ring, an unenchanted necklace, and unenchanted bracers. Head, head, neck, arm, hand. At 100% enchanting, those should each be +25 to Alchemy. Then you gotta go get some alchemy ingredients. You need Abacean Longfin, and Cirodillic Spadetail for a fortify restoration potion. You'll want to duplicate out a hundred or so of those. You also want blue butterfly wings and snowberries for a fortify enchanting potion. Duplicate out a hundred or so of those. \n\nMake a fortify restoration potion wearing all that fortify alchemy gear you just made. Drink the potion. Without closing the menu, go to the gear you are wearing, take it off and put it back on. Make another fortify restoration potion. Keep doing this until each piece is around +1000 to alchemy. Don't overdue it. Once your alchemy gear is supercharged, make a dozen or so fortify enchanting potions. You're gonna use these specifically to enchant another ring or necklace or something with fortify Alchemy. Now you don't have to take all that time to supercharge your alchemy gear, you have the one ring to rule them all to make any supercharged potion you want. \n\nNow go make a hundred or so more fortify enchanting potions. \n\nGo get all the supplies to make whatever armor you like. It genuinely doesn't matter. This will work with regular clothes. You're gonna enchant a necklace (using supercharged fortify enchanting potions) to fortify health and magic. You're gonna forify some boots with fortify stamina and carry weight. Armor you're gonna fortify with smithing and whatever else. A ring gets fortify alchemy and fortify one handed and two handed. A hat or circlet or helmet gets fortify archery and waterbreathing. \n\nYou now have godmode enabled. Nothing can hurt you and you can make a bow that will literally oneshot Alduin. You can sell a single poition to max out speech, and once you do you can select perks to sell anything to any merchant. By now you should be pretty high level, so make sure your weapons can do appropriate damage. \n\nThe conjured bow is faster than any other bow, and is affected by your fortify alchemy helmet. You can use a grinding wheel to make a shitty iron dagger that can one shot anything. \n\nThis is a totally fair and balanced game.\n\nMan if only Aldiun was difficult in any capacity to warrant any step of that process but he's not so just kill him with whatever stuff you loot in the final dungeon even if you aren't spec'd into it\n\nTransmute spell and gold rings works way better\n\nSkyrim's version of ebony weapons was so elegant...\n\nIt always kind of annoyed me that Daedric/Dragon stuff was better, IMO the Ebony gear looked the best and should have been the highest tier\n\nin terms of armor, it's pretty easy to hit the armor cap. if you're able to craft your own ebony armor, you should be able to improve it so you're at the cap either way.\n\nTIL that there's an armor cap.\n\nIt's very poorly explained since the game only gives you an \"armour rating\" number which goes up even after you've hit the cap. I've no idea why the base UI for Skyrim was so poorly designed\n\nProbably because bethesda has never designed a good UI lmao\n\nI really like the base Morrowind and Oblivion UIs. Not perfect but they gave you a lot more information about what was going on, showed your active buffs and debuffs and the duration of them, had nice icons for each spell type, etc. And then in Skyrim they threw it all away\n\n&gt; I've no idea why the base UI for Skyrim was so poorly designed\n\nOh, that's an easy one: it was simplified for consoles\n\n*looks at my swod and board heavy armor orc*...*looks at comment*. Well shit. what is it?\n\nthe armor cap is around 600 I think\n\n567\n\nSteel and Ebony sets were the best in Skyrim, the Oblivion ones I'd say probably Glass. It's strange, but unique and very striking, and stylish.\n\nI liked the Ebony in Oblivion too, but it’s a very different vibe from Skyrim.\n\nI liked the Nordic stuff as well, not sure which part of the game's life that came out in.\n\nThose came with the Dragonborn DLC\n\nYeah, but teenage me would have killed for some morrowind daedric weapons though. My favorite was the daedric wakazashi \"shield\" mod with a daedric katana as my primary.\n\nAre they supposed to be actual ebony (a type of wood) or obsidian (a type of glass) or just some black metal?\n\nIn the world of TES they are generally considered the strongest metal mortal beings can use as weapons.\n\n[removed]\n\nYeah, I think a crossguard would have helped the design greatly. Or going the oblivion route. Those were beautiful\n\nNICE brother!\n\nthank you detailing the material. \"Is it made of ebony wood\" was my first question lol.\n\n  \nI imagine it was done over the course of a couple of months whenever you had spare time, but how long would you say you spent actually working on this?\n\n&gt; \"Is it made of ebony wood\n\nEbony \"ore\", of course.  Whatever that is.\n\nI feel like it's one of these ways the game world deviates from ours - apparently it's close to obsidian, but it's not glass or wood. It's *glass-like*, but it's still ore: [https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Raw\\_Ebony](https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Raw_Ebony) and looks like it could be magical in by itself.\n\nLore wise it's the petrified blood of Lorkhan iirc\n\nThats pretty fuckin metal\n\nYea iirc his heart was ripped out when he was killed at the ~~White Gold Tower~~ Edit: Admantium Tower and skewered on an arrow shot across the world to Red Mountain. It bled on the way there and continued to bleed there so ebony deposits are scattered where the blood flowed.\n\n&gt; White Gold Tower \n\nAdamantine Tower in High Rock, actually. The tower, of course, being Akatosh's spaceship and not a structure.\n\nThe blood of a god, obviously\n\nI'd like to answer my door with that axe in hand and a hearty \"NEVER SHOULD HAVE COME HERE\". Very nicely done OP!\n\n\"I SMELL WEAKNESS\" would be pretty terrifying to hear if you walked into the wrong house.  This axe is an awesome piece\n\nI have a neighbor I would love to greet that way. And thank you \\^\\^\n\nYou are most welcome friend.\n\nAwesome stuff, never played Skyrim but I recommend you put this in the black smithing Reddit’s cause it’s beautiful.\n\nMaybe. I am still a beginner weapon maker, so there is still a lot of stuff to learn before I present it to the matter experts XD\n\nAll the more reason to then, no? If they see something you could do better that we can't then its an opportunity to learn a bit\n\nWell good on you regardless my dude!\n\nMust've used a lot of copies of Skyrim\n\nFortunately we all have extra from the numerous times we've bought it.\n\nYou need that for those who come to steal your sweet roll\n\nExactly right. And by sweetroll I mean my wife. And my arsenal. And my sweetrolls\n\nThat's quite the fancy graphics mod you have there! Almost thought the stump was real :D\n\nYeah, a new 8k texture mod ;-)\n\n​It's strange that so many immediately defaulted to asking for commissions.\n\nEnjoying the post of this 10/10 steel ingot marvel, is plentiful\n\nStrange? Seems pretty normal to me. OP made a beautiful product that people want.\n\nYeah, for sure, I'm I wish i could buy one of thoes and I doubt I'm alone\n\nI mean, I get it. I am only a beginner blacksmith and I am still not confident enough in my skill to make stuff for other people. My wcs is if people try to do stuff with my weapons and break them, or themselves. Blades if not heat treated properly (a thing I still suck at) can shatter and seriously injure you\n\nHow did you get started? Was this done working with someone else? It seems like a skill that is hard to self-start, but jeez the outcomes are really nice. Being able to craft a blade like this is a lifelong dream for me.\n\nIs there risk from the sharp pommel?  It seems like you are putting your hands in danger if they were to slip while you were swinging.  Or if the butt of the axe managed to hit into you during a careless downswing.  Am I imagining those dangers or do you feel like you have to be extra careful when you handle it?\n\nYeah, but I took the design and went 1:1 with it. And it is a nice optical touch since it fits the lines very well. I didn´t hurt myself on it yet, but I only finished it on sunday XD\n\nEven though it is fictional, the axe is designed for combat, where your hands and legs would be protected by armour or in other ways. \nI wouldn’t use it to chop wood IRL.\n\n...but to answer the question, yes. The \"war-iest\" war hatchets specifically do not have the sharpened Strike Pommel^(tm), despite it's superior ending-rightly capability.\n\nI would imagine that a blunted pommel would usually be better. Like, if your sharp edge isn't working, then they probably have some sort of armor, and a blunt weapon would be better than nothing. And if you need an accurate sharp weapon, it's not it's that tough to carry a dagger.\n\nExactly. I just stuck it in there to take the picture and kill some pumpkins\n\nHow did you get the steel to look this black? Did you literally just paint it or is there some sort of thing to make it look black? Steel alloy?\n\nI used three different approaches. First forge blackening with wax and oil, but that was too spotty. Then Gun blue, but that turned out too brownish. And than a protective laquer I usually use for the inside of armor pieces. Rather durable. And the other two approaches make it so you don´t see scratches and stuff as easily\n\nLook up gun blueing.\n\nLooks great 👍\n\nHonest question - are you planning to mount it in the house for decoration? A costume for Halloween? LARP? Cutting down the brush in the front of the house? Selling it?\n\nIt looks terrific(!), just curious what the life of that axe would be like.\n\nIt is for my growing elder scrolls arms and armor collection. We are cosplayers and want to do some booths with exhibitions with them. It will be used as prop for photoshoots and such\n\n1” plate steel and a grinder?  My question is about the scrollwork.  Is it paint, or did you score through the black enamel?  \nSome nice welds, too.\n\nBasically yeah. I set on two 1cm c45 (1045) steel plates for the edge and the spike so they can be hardened. Middle is mild steel as is the rest of the axe.\nThe axe is first forge blackened but that was spotty so I used gunblue and an automotive laquer to give it the color. And I used a dremel to put in the engravings\n\nEbony and Glass were always my jam. Not because they were the best but because they just looked so cool.\n\nFor me ebony and the carved nordic stuff. One day I will make the nordic sword\n\nLooking hot!!!😊\n\nWow that is absolutely beautiful. Amazing job!\n\nThis set was always way cooler than the dragon bone stuff.\n\n[removed]\n\nHighest praise for a cosplayer and propmaker\n\nNice beard\n\nBUT IS IT REAL EBONY?\n\nI wish. But since ebony only bonds with gold as an alloy, it would be waaaay to expensive\n\nThis looks like talent. :)\n\nThat looks like lots of grinding.\n\nThat looks really cool. Just don't try to vendor it, they're underpaying massively.\n\nAs someone who watches shows like Forged in Fire, a video of you making this would be incredibly interesting.\n\n[deleted]\n\nHope you maxed out on blacksmithing potions before crafting this. Truly a piece of art!\n\nImpressive 🪓\n\nLove the lines, great work\n\nHow practical is this asa. Wood chopping axe\n\nNot very. It'll probably get the job done but there's a reason felling axes and splitting axes have the shapes that they have instead of battleaxe shapes.\n\nte quedo una joya perfecta y hermosa\n\nSweeeeetttt I want one\n\nnice, what are the stats! \n\nmajestic\n\nFuck yeah you did! That looks awesome!\n\nThat's it's, take your upvote and go.... \n\nPreferably to make something else, because that is fucking incredible\n\nLet me guess, that spike at the handle is an absolute hazard to the user?\n\nAbsolutely love it!\n\nLeanwolf better shaped weapon mod installed?\n\nPlease make the Ebony Warrior next.\n\nI'll take two please\n\nLooks great.\n\nThe pointy blade at the handle's end seems like a potential hazard to the wielder.\n\nI am far from being an expert at these things, but having something pointy towards the torso of the user seems like a bad idea.\n\nWow that’s is gorgeous, how’s the balance?\n\nOh my god. My favorite axe of all time, games, movies or TV. Holy moly that's beautiful.\n\nBad fucking ass. Whip on that paralysis enchant and she’s set.\n\nIs the hilt super sharp? Looks a bit gnarly to chop wood with.  Nice work.\n\nBest I can do you is 200 Septims\n\nThat is really cool. It looks identical. Nice work!\n\nI came\n\nWell, now you can officially change your name to Eorland, and call your smithy the Skyforge.\n\nWhy is my mouth salivating?\n\nAnd you're using it to split wood??\n\nBlood of Lorkhan!\n\nDid he write Black Speech in elvish but reversed IN CURSIVE\n\ndudes will see this and say 'Hell Yea'\n\nThis is seriously beautiful.\n\nReal nice mate!! \n\nBtw, anyone knows when the next game after Skyrim is coming and what it’s name gonna be?\n\nlooks like a halligan tool\n\nSerious question : how does one start learning to forge?\nI'd like to but there's not a single blacksmith in my area\n\nYoutube is a great source to get started. Black bear forge does a ton of easy to follow videos. Tools can be a bit trícky, but you can start with a bigger sledge hammer as an anvil and a firepit as a forge. And always wear a respirator. If you have questions, you can always dm me and I will answer to the best of my knowledge\n\nOh awesome\n\nBadass\n\nF-yeah! awesome!\n\nOh, so it's not actually made of ebony. How disappointing.\n\nu/TheRaimundCosplay Good sir, I realize you said you don't do commissions currently, and I don't even own a wood burning stove, but I seriously feel an extremely strong urge to own one of these, and chop wood with it. You could make some money with this, no doubt about it.  \n  \nI do have a large outdoor firepit, and I'm thinking that I probably need to acquire one of these, and make bonfires a regular community event at my house.\n\n  \nIf there is no option to buy this, do you care to share/show how it was made?\n\nLooks good, good job.\n\nCool\n\nI dont lumberjack but this makes me want to\n\nThat's freaking awesome\n\nNicee\n\nBro, that is top tier work. How long did yhou spend on the engraving?\n\nThe ebony axe was my favorite weapon in the game.  I don’t care if it does less damage than the dadric or dragon weapons.  I can still boost its damage from legendary smithing and enchanting.\n\nHow's she cutting?\n\nlooks like that could be used for an awesome Sun Dial\n\nVery impressive!\n\nHow long did it take?\n\nNice\n\nI don't know jack about Skyrim, but that's some nice work.\n\nWay too sik\n\nholy shit that is fucking sick\n\nKinda looks like the [Crowbaxe](https://youtu.be/1RWo2eI5K-8?si=bCJt-40PaNePsRT_)\n\nAwesome work, this is dope AF.\n\ncan you teach me how (or better yet direct me to resources on how to figure out how to get into this hobby myself)\n\nThe engravings are beautiful. Well done\n\nLooks nice! You must have eaten a bunch of Cyrodilic spadetails before you made it.\n\nthats sick lol\n\nbadass!\n\nHow did you get the color? That is awesome \n\nI WANT ... MOAR!\n\nI'm re-playing God of War at the moment and my axe looks just like that, but colourful. I'd love to see what OP could make of the GoW weapons and armour.\n\nBeautiful\n\nFuck I’m so sad you don’t do commissions, that looks sick and I don’t have an axe yet\n\nEpic!\n\nThat's awesome\n\nlooks great\n\n[removed]\n\nIs it truly functional though?\n\nNgl for a second I thought it was Kratos axe 😭 good job tho\n\nLooks amazing\n\nI really want to buy that shit\n\nHoly shit that’s so SICK. I would pay for this shit 100%!\n\nThe ebony weapons are my favorite! \nThis is awesome\n\nholy shit that's amazing.   awesome work\n\nThat’s so sick\n\nLiterally killer design\n\nThats awesome.\n\nHow sturdy/functional would you say it is?\n\nNow make the glass 🤣 \n\nNice work though\n\n“It’s made out of steel and weighs between 5 and 6 lbs. \nI believe it’s made with ebony ingots and weighs 17 lbs, dumbass.\n\nI would like an arrow plz.\n\nNice work\n\nOut of curiosity, How much would the Battle Axe version weigh roughly?\n\nKind of fun to know how much the equivalent might weigh IRL.\n\nY’know, a lot of the weapons in Skyrim look unusable, but this one actually looks like it could be someone’s favorite, in game and irl. It’s got a stabby point, a chop point and a pierce point. Don’t forget the small dagger point at the handle. That dagger point is short and faces away so it doesn’t get in the way of swinging. A dagger point like that can prove vital for clenching and binding with opponents. And engravings… give no tactical advantage whatsoever. But a normal person would love engravings none the less. That was some fancy forging. Pretty good.\n\nNot only is it a beautiful axe, you also crafted it a bit more proportionally reasonable than Skyrim has it. Very well done Raimund.\n\nOMG!! It’s so cool when stuff like this are done so realistically. Author, your skill is just incredible! ✨\n\nIncredible work, I can't imagine the cosplayer or larper who wouldn't jump at the chance to hold it.\n\nCrafting and crafting\n\nMaybe not a commission, but if you ever start making videos about making these things... this is the content I'd binge. Makes me want to go back to binge Man at Arms. Keep up the good work regardless of what you do. And if you do make videos, post them so I can find you\n\nI love to see weapons of imaginative worlds emerge in reality. Great job!"

    "all_comment_text": "I thought those lit up map spots actually represented players online, but seeing a lit up map and only 156 online I guess not\n\nThere is some that actually do that, and the worst one was halo 3, fully lit at release and after, now server are shut down, the map is completely dark, and it’s depressing :(\n\nIt has been one of my favourite and maybe my best era of video games, halo 3, cod4, cod waw, bf3, black ops 1, mw2, halo reach, and mw3, full friend list were playing, the hype for those game were lasting for so long, everyone was just insane on them, I miss it so much 😭\n\n[removed]\n\nI fucking miss all night 4 player split screen sessions\n\nGoldeneye started it all. I remember kicking my older brother and his two friend’s ass. \n\nThey got so pissed they all decided to team up on me, I was still slaughtering them. \n\nThen the resorted to physically beating me while I slaughtered them. I was unstoppable. But then again playing against the world is a lot harder than your brother and his friends. \n\nCore gaming memory…one of the bastards was even cheating and using odd job.\n\nEvery Halloween we would have a super smash bros tournament and bet our candy, I won everyone's candy every year.\n\nThis was the game cube super smash and I'd just juggle everyone around the map with foxes upkicks, I was untouchable\n\nI'm thirty now and got the new one for switch.......i suck\n\nI know that feeling….you’re getting slow old man…(looks in mirror)\n\nI was so damn good in NHL94 man, literally unbeatable in Saskatoon lol. \n\nI convinced my son to let me plug in the Sega again and he kicked my ass 11-0. \"Who is Wendel Clark, he's pretty good!\"\n\nYou're not getting slow, you're just not using that skill often enough.\n\nI'm approaching 30 and just today in Tekken 8 I broke a throw on reaction. I think the window is 20 frames so 0,3 seconds reaction window to press the correct button.\n\nYa'll can't play fighting games because you're getting old, ya'll can't play fighting games because you're untrained.\n\nFew years ago I chaparoned a group of students who went to a fun zone. It had some arcade games. My ex, their teacher, told one of the kids I used to play in arcades. \n\nSo kid comes up and asks if I want to play. I ask what game? He says street fighter 2. I give the kid a hard look and asked if he ever played? He says he played on his dads genesis and was really good. \n\nI told him I would play, but I would not spend more than 50 cents. First round he could choose my character. He has me play Zangief. I play defense solely for 2 rounds. Both time outs in his favor. \n\nSecond round I take Guile. I play defense for 1.5 rounds and make it look good. Half way through second round I ask if he is warmed up? \n\nHe asks 'What?' \n\nI destroy him. Next round perfect. I tell him I will keep playing until he beats me or he runs through all remaining characters. \n\nPerfect. Perfect. Perfect. Perfect. He did get a few cheap shots with Ryus fireball and Blancas electric, but this poor kid was dismantled. \n\nWhen done he just looks at me. \n\"Congratulations. You just got taken to school on a field trip.\"\n\nI went and sat down for 20 mins, then came back with a role of quarters and proceeded to give him an honest lesson on blocking. Same as an older kid did for me in an arcade years before. It was really fun because he was so driven to learn.  I was teaching him psychology. I pointed out when he was losing his cool. How to use blocking to make an opponent lose his cool, wedge an opening. Use blocking to watch an opponents stick work. \n\nI thought it was good fun. Then when I sat down my ex told me that he was the kid who had serious ADHD and couldn't focus well. She said she had never seen him more engaged and focused. \n\nIt was a really special moment. I got to teach a kid the grace and benefit in losing. When he graduated he came up to me and told me he spent a lot of time on his dads Genesis remembering what I told him. He even proudly stated \"My dad can't beat me anymore!\"\n\nIt's still a really good memory.\n\nI said this before on another another post where people in their 30s and beyond were getting all depressed how it's all downhill now; I'm currently in my prime after playing video games my entire life and I'm 34 this year.\n\nI can go back to any game I've ever played and with a little warm up, be better than I was then. It's exactly as you said, people just lose their edge in *any* skill they don't use, could be languages, a sport or video games - maybe just a specific genre even.\n\nWhat if I told you that Melee for GameCube happens to still have a thriving competitive community separate from the new releases? I play that exact game (and fox) almost daily lol.\n\nThe new ones are just not as good. That’s why we play melee.\n\nI got into a fistfight with a kid because he was mad I was dunking on him in OG super smash with donkey Kong and he was pissed about it.\n\nI miss donkey Kong lol just pick people up and run off the edge with em\n\n&gt;They got so pissed they all decided to team up on me\n\nThis happened to me and my older brothers with a wrestling game, I think it was smackdown vs raw. I would do one finishing move on one of them, leaving his character writhing on the ground, then sprint to the other and do the same to him. So many good memories of pwning noobs\n\nI loved playing Goldeneye in the dorms. I laid waste to so many people I would come around a room and ask to play and no one would let me anymore. \n\nMy favorite thing to say during games would be \"It's Klobering time!\" Good times\n\nI remember figuring out screen peeking. Then the first time playing someone else good at screen peeking and both of us were running around looking at the floor, so stupid and funny at the time.\n\nYo I tried to play coop with one of my nephews on a 2 player split screen and he goes \"no one does that anymore\"\n\nThe loss of local multiplayer seems like such a detriment for kids. Boredom and technological limitations forced us to hang out so so much and I'm so grateful for it.\n\nThe lack of split screen on systems is so fucking annoying.  Like my PC has a bazillion times the processing power of older consoles, but there are only a handful of current games I can play with two people using controllers?  \n\nThe fuck is this shit.  Gaming used to be so much more social.  I played 'it takes two' with my spouse and we loved it, it was fun to get to share my hobby with her.  She had fun and asked me to find more games like it... except... there just aren't?  Like what the fuck? Why not.  \n\nStudios instead of chasing the next stupid live action bullshit, how about just focus on fundamentals like make games that are fun when played with you friends, in the same fucking room.\n\nAre you me. I did the same with it takes two and I'm yet to find something similar for the two of us\n\nAhh yes, the days of getting my ass 3 shot by everyone with a pistol on Halo because all my friends played console and I was the only PC gamer.\n\nI was one of 3 in my friend group who weren't allowed to use the pistol. If we did the others at our Xbox would unplug our controllers 😂\n\nThe worst part of golden ages is you don't know how good you had it until after it's gone.\n\nAndy is that you\n\nRit-Dit-Dit-Di-Do\n\nI think about this way too much, and my conclusion is that we are just humans and its how our brains evolved to survive, often anxious and busy, to survive dangers and provide, leading to it being difficult to feel content in general without mindfulness.\n\nAgreed, it was the golden age.\n\n$5 DLC packs with 10 new maps. Campaign and achievement based earnable skins/weapons. Yeah... Absolutely the Golden Era of multiplayer gaming.\n\nAt least those prices are reasonable for the content compared to today.\n\nPlus i had less financial things to worry about at that time. So it wasnt a big deal then for many people - it was revolutionary. Games could continue to get extra content on them on consoles. Now its expected.\n\nI would still say its the golden age. Have yet to have a multiplayer experience as compelling as Halo 3 and Modern Warfare 2.\n\nI don't think the person you replied to was being sarcastic. Sincerely, $5 for plenty of content on the understanding the developers are working hard and deserve paid?\n\nDone.\n\nFortnites shop alone makes me detest anyone who defends the games business practices.\n\nThank you for pointing that out. It's a little hard to tell because that \"yeah...\" could be \"yeah, *sure* it was\" or a sincere \"yeah, it was...\".\n\nYou mean you don't like paying $30 for two gun camos and rectangular image to put next to your name when you kill someone?\n\nIf you play Asian fps games then it's $30 for a 2 week rental of that camo and rectangle box then they expire and you have to buy them again. The camo will make your gun deal more damage though.\n\nGolden Eye you say?\n\nI was lucky enough to have been to a few 16 player Halo 2 LAN Parties back in the day. It was an awesome experience.\n\n[deleted]\n\nDo you remember 1 vs 100 on Xbox live? Shit was dope af. Taken away way too quick. I think it was released around the times the avatar characters were \n\nomg yes, I remember getting my mum to help me with some of the questions on it.\n\nIt was awesome! I actually won once. Felt like a Queen for days after.\n\nLiterally, I skipped so much school to play halo 3 with my friends. Some of my best memories.\n\nAlso don't skip school kids.\n\nBefore the dark times. Before the shareholders demanded line go up.\n\nShareholders have always been demanding that the line go up, the difference is that now middle managers don't care enough to do things that are both good and that makes the line go up; and then the upper management and execs aren't present at the company often enough to notice.\n\nI'm old and cranky. For me the golden age of multiplayer had already passed by the time this list was current. I've never enjoyed any multiplayer shooters as much as I did Quake and Unreal. Time will forget me.\n\nLowgrav Instagib CTF will forever live on in our hearts.\n\nWe telefragged so they could rocket jump. \n\nWe all had our era and damn was it the best of times. \n\nSo many hours spent with my two best friends, play Quake 2 against the Eraser Bot, on my 3 computers with Voodoo cards in them, at a time when having _one_ computer was still not the norm. \n\nI had a huge skin pack, so I setup the bots to be Homer Simpson, Waldo (as in Where's Waldo?) and some other super hero skin. Homer was set at the highest, cheating-ist level, Waldo a little down from that, and the super hero another step down from Waldo. I knew all the map names, not just Q2DM1-8, but all the game level maps, and I'd move us to a good map at the end of every map.\n\nI Miss all the shit talking, it was so goofy.  Multiplayer games now might as well be against bots most of the time with how limited voice chat/text chat usually is.\n\nThe golden age of being a kid and not having to work or have any real responsibilities.\n\nThough it does seem like sony/xbox/nintendo have all done their best to kill it since by making it paid.\n\nI meam tbf, kids and teens still have the full party of friends talking shit thing going on. We're just all older and it's more rare people stick with it. The people I game with now are between like 17 and 55, and it's still shooters and shit playing until like 4am on the weekends it's just now everyone is pretty understanding when you say it's an early night tonight bc you work later.\n\nHalo 3, even around 3 years after launch, had more players by far than Halo 4 months after release, which struggled to hit 30k many days peak players. I still played Halo 3, even in 2016ish too.\n\nWe played Halo 3 on LAN at my high school, no clue who installed it on all the computer lab computers but it was great lol. Literally my only real LAN experience with gaming but man ping was no thing.\n\nMust've been Halo:CE. Halo 3 wasn't on PC until the release of MCC.\n\nEither Halo CE or Halo 2 Vista. People ported the halo3 maps to both games so maybe it was a mod?\n\nIt really was the golden age of online gaming\n\nPre-lootcrate/live service games. Simpler times.\n\nTo me, the biggest canary in the coal mine moment was when every new multiplayer online game had complete control of the servers.\n\nIt blows my mind that the era of Half life 1 and half life 2 and all of their mods etc. etc. and all of the public servers are basically a thing of the past.\n\n[deleted]\n\nThere was a Penny-Arcade from literally like 10-15 years ago where Tycho was talking about something like they will take our servers from our cold dead hands.\n\nI can't find it, but people were calling him alarmest at the time.\n\nI remember this one!\n\nI started googling for it, and I started \"Penny-Arcade about servers\" and the auto-complete was \"and cold dead hands.\" Score!\n\nExcept...none of the results contained those words at all. Google is such complete trash.\n\nYeah. I did the exact same thing.\n\nLive service was around just not as prevalent as they are now. MMO's were charging monthy subs back in the 90's i'm pretty sure.\n\nMMOs are kind of a different thing, but they had their own bubble and giant list of failures. I'm very surprised that the industry doesn't see the similarities between the MMO rush of the early 2000s, and the current GAAS rush.  It's almost as if most of the suits in management don't know the industry they are in. They both are failures for the same reason. People only has so much time to invest into a game.\n\nHalo 3 was my jam. Never got a 50, but I was a Brigadier General with a shit ton of XP. Nothing compares to that online community.\n\nGot to a 49 and then won 5 straight.... never got that close to 50 again.\n\nMW3 and BO2 are the last really memorable ones for me, aside from the others you listed.\n\nYess , halo! . Came with a theme tune that will never let you forget too . \n\nI think in a few more years hearing that out of the blue might actually make me cry\n\nI was more of a Halo Reach, MW2, MW3, Blops1-2, Bf3-4 and I remember seeing friends on all the games even years afterwards due to how good they were. Now you just don’t see people playing a cod from a few years ago anymore.\n\nJust FYI, Battlefield games still have a solid online presence. I still play BF1 frequently. There's always full lobbies.\n\nSame brother, I’m 29. The *PEAK* of gaming for me was COD 4, MW2, the first black ops, WaW…then there was halo 2/halo 3…\n\nUsed to be able to sink hours into those games and have so much fun. Now I can’t play for more than an hour without getting bored. Feelsbadman\n\nThe toxicity of those lobbies really toughened you up and prepared you for the future lol. I hear chirping in lobbies now and it’s like, is that the best you got? I was born in the salt, every generation of my family has been insulted, every facet of my being made fun of, it’s not new and the fact that you make me laugh instead of rage must piss you off to no extent.\n\nGlory days. That's when I was in college and my roommates and I played halo 3 or modern warfare ALL THE TIME.\n\nHalo 3 and cod 4 raised me\n\nI miss the one dot in the middle of Africa\n\nAt one point it actually did but I think at some point it broke for the older CODs that had it\n\nI know for a fact that Black Ops 1 on the PS3 has a bugged player count. I played it during lockdown and it said that there were over 1 million players online. Meanwhile I could barely fill up a single lobby😂\n\nthey changed all of those when they added the games to game pass so they actually show the real count, but any of the old dead cods just had made up player counts before that\n\nI was always skeptical with the old Call of Duty lobby maps, as there ALWAYS seemed to be one player online, living on an island several hundred miles off the east coast of Madagascar.\n\nThe Maldives is several hundred miles east of Madagascar and has a population of like 1.5 million people.\n\nI used to be that guy. Playing on my Xbox 360 from Réunion Island with 300ms ping lol. COD was really good at compensating lag. Same for Halo.\n\nI remember this! As a kid I remember imagining some guy on a freighter ship laying in his bunk playing COD\n\nThat was me, sorry\n\nI play BO2 a few nights a week at least, there's always about a hundred players in team deathmatch at night. The matches are usually fun save for the occasional wallhacker.\n\nIf you want to have a nostalgia ride, feel free to drop in and kick my ass. You'll recognize me by the abysmal k/d.\n\nCrackdown 2 has one that does this\n\nOh man, Crackdown and Crackdown 2 were so much fun in coop. Honestly, if they made a remaster of them both and put it on PC I’d happily buy it\n\nYeah, but like I said once in r/Crackdown Microsoft would never spend the money to remaster either game just to put them on PC and I honestly doubt that after the flop that was crackdown 3 they will ever consider a 4th game anytime soon\n\nYup, after the horrible mess they made of 3, Crackdown is probably just dead now.\n\nSome games switch from a real map to a static one as the player base dwindles.\n\nI always thought the same as well, because I remember laughing one time looking at the globe seeing just one dot in antartica and that made me laugh for some reason thinking just one dude out there playing.\n\nWatching Halo 3's lights go totally dark was harrowing\n\nThat was the end of an era, nothing quite hits like Halo 3 nostalgia.\n\nIt was Halo 2 for me.  No gaming experience will ever top the amount of fun I had playing that game online.\n\nHalo 2 modded lobbies will be the pinnacle of online gaming for me\n\nSpending time perfecting the super-bounces with my buddies will always be a fond memory\n\nRemember the first time you landed the triple bounce on headlong?\n\nOh god… I haven’t thought about that in a decade. That map consumed so many hours of my childhood, even just offline empty at first because parents couldn’t afford Xbox Live… just exploring the map and looking at every detail and trying to find different bounce spots once I found out about super bounces… \n\nGood times 🥲\n\nBreaking out of the map with the banshee, using a buddy to sword lunge to get into the craziest spots is another very fond memory I have of that map.\n\nI believe just once my buddy and I got to the highest building doing the sword cancel jump stuff.\n\nThe custom game lobbies built on trust to play the game correctly, the modded jump lobbies, modded warthog races; all before forge was even a thing. man I just had such a strong hit of nostalgia.\n\nOh man, the modded lobbies were so fun to stumble into. Just shooting warthogs out of rocket launchers, or when people made race tracks up in the sky for warthog racing. \n\nAnd then learning every super bounce on every map on YouTube, CoD sniping montages, Machinima CoD commentary…. Fuck I miss those days\n\nHalo 2 and playing vanilla wow during my junior and senior years at high school left some lasting memories.\n\nThis so much. It was right before online matchmaking became fully mainstream so youd have Halo matches with your friends in someone's basement then online matches when you get home. \n\nMy one buddy was always so good when we all played together. Many years later he finally admitted he was screen looking.\n\nBack when games were simple, just a boy and his battle rifle. Maybe I’m just old now but god damn shooters became such bloated pieces of trash, haven’t touched one since BF1.\n\nUnreal Tournament 2004, my god that game was incredible. Instagib shock rifle on face3 / face classic. Or even with regular settings, getting the sniper rifle and going up the tower - HEADSHOT!\n\nGrifball!\n\nThe second weekend after launch was insane. Remember seeing over a million online playing multiplayer.\n\nHalo 3 broke like 1,200,000 on launch day on 360 alone. It was wild.\n\nHalo 3 launched in 2007 and it was only available on Xbox 360.  It wasnt on another platform until 2013, and that was just another xbox generation.   It didnt get a pc port until 2020.\n\n*sad \"Never Forget\" cues....*\n\nThere are plenty of games that bring a flood of nostalgia back to me, but none quite like Halo, and a lot of that has to do with the _music_. Marty and co COOKED so hard, even before halo 3, but halo 3 in particular\n\n[deleted]\n\nThat was my first thought, looks like Black Ops didn’t do the real time IP lights like Halo did\n\nhttps://youtu.be/kx89YG487SU?si=9lydOblrv5vvx1nX\n\n:(\n\nYou will only find players in tdm. When there are no hackers in the lobby its still pretty fun.\n\n[deleted]\n\nhow does one obtain plutonium?\n\nNuclear reactors usually have some lying around\n\nI do like your comment, but I want to be amusing and pedantic and say that nuclear reactors, in fact, do *not* have Plutonium available either in use or elsewhere. They exclusively use low-enrichment Uranium.\n\nLibyans\n\nGoogle cod plutonium and click the first link. Hope you can manage.\n\nMW3 (2011) is mostly infection or TDM nowadays.\n\n“I wish there was a way to know you’re in “the good old days”, before you’ve actually left them.” - Andy Bernard 😔\n\nI think there is. If anyone gets the excited sentiment \"I can't wait to see what amazing things the future will have after this!\" You'd know it's really all going to be down hill.\n\nI just remind myself that I’m already in the good old days. Right now. These are the days I’m gonna look back on and wish I still had. So I need to get the fuck up and start doing something. Enjoy it while you’ve got it. Your good old days could end abruptly tomorrow in a car accident where you die, and then you’ll be left longing for the good old days that you think you never had because you didn’t get the fuck up and MAKE THEM.\n\nBeautifully said man. I’ve come to this realization really recently too and it’s been a properly eye opening experience. You really begin to appreciate the time you’re in more and reminding yourself that you’ll look back at the time you’re currently in, and miss it.\n\neven if you knew, what would that change? if anything it’ll take you out of the moment. just enjoy yourself and be happy it happened.\n\nI like how that was kind of a silly line in a comedy show, but has ended up resonating with so many people.\n\n\"Things are only going to get worse from here\" wouldn't make the moment any better.\n\n[deleted]\n\nNot really, Ghosts had this display. Don’t remember if any later installments had it but I know for sure Ghosts had it.\n\nIt was Little Big Planet that hit me the hardest. I remember playing it when it first released and the top levels always contained thousands of players each! I tried playing a few years back and it was a ghost town.\n\nI made so many friends on that game, and sadly none of them play video games anymore.\n\nHuge memories playing that I can fully relate, that was such a socially chill game\n\nwith a killer soundtrack.\n\nStill my favourite game too. Dont understand why Sony dont give us a new one for PS5\n\nEspecially when sack boy is still one of their mascots. Hell didn't they release a Little Big Planet side game for ps5?\n\nYep. Sackboy: A Big Adventure. It's actually a really cool game, and the music and gameplay brought back memories and literally made me cry tears of joy. It scratched the LBP itch that I had for a while.\n\nI mean to be fair even if the servers are gone there’s still private ones like Beacon which granted aren’t gonna ever be as popular as the original but for what it’s worth there’s like 10 people minimum (at night usually) sometimes 150 maximum online (from what I remember a couple of months ago they passed 10k players, which is impressive when the only way you can play is a hacked ps3, hacked vita or rpcs3) which I mean for what it’s worth is pretty good especially since most of them would let you dive in meaning plenty of people to play with.\n\nI think the community may be smaller than it was but it’s still alive and (pun intended) tight knit which I really like. Contests, dive ins, unique levels etc still happen a lot\n\niirc the level selection is a fraction of what it once was though. the outlast series is one that comes to mind. the hide and seek games are another. the survival soldier series was another these were all lbp2 games.\n\nEvery level has been archived\n\nBrother you don’t even know. They pulled the plug on the halo 2 server far too early back in the day.\n\nSome of us remained online even after the plug was pulled for as long as we could. Our story used to be told, but it has mostly been lost to time. Still one of my best gaming moments to be part of that.\n\nWere you a part of the [final 14?](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/4cugjk/the_noble_14_the_last_people_to_play_halo_2/#lightbox)\n\nNo sir, I only made it a couple of days before a power outage. There were still dozens of us when I lost connection.\n\nlol. I remember hearing when the last match crashed.\n\nBrings me back to the countless hours of forge maps with my friends on Halo 3. Nothing quite like it.\n\nFor me it was the pit in ODST :)\n\nOh man I remember playing baseball with the rocket launcher and the hammer\n\nLol, we have a group of around 20 players that still play a clone of a game that was released in 1997.  Long live the early online multiplayer games!!!!\n\nSubspace/Continuum?\n\nStill plenty of people playing Quake Live, last I checked\n\nI miss being able to hop on for a match at any time. Of all games where that affects things heavily, I think I miss Infantry Online the most.\n\nSo many modes, roles, and options. All full and active at any time of day. RIP.\n\nReminds me of the slow death that Phantasy Star Universe went through across PC and the 360. Every month a \"Universe\" would lose a full star, and then the empty stars would start disappearing. In its 7th and final year for the PC, only 1 universe had more than 2 empty stars and 1 full star.\n\ncapture the flag???? what do you mean????\n\nit was all about One In The Chamber. now THAT was a fire game mode 🔥\n\nIdk man, Black Ops 1 Capture the Flag was so good. It didn't show you where the flag holder was at, so often someone would take the flag and hide, so the game would go on for ages.\n\nStill more online than Concord\n\nWent on CoD World at War last night- 193 online, 21! in match making. It feels like a different world seeing those numbers in the 100k range\n\nI tried to log in a few times the past days but it says there is a problem with the servers 🥲\n\nWhy on earth hasn’t Microsoft added all the older cods to gamepass yet, it would do wonders for the player count.\n\nBecause older CoD games compete with their modern releases. You cannot ask as much for an old game, so you have to sell it cheaper. People play that game more instead, less people by the new game.\n\nI don’t think activision have picked up on the have to sell it cheaper part yet.\n\nEdit Microsoft own acitvision now??? Damn I’m out of the loop.\n\nI think Microsoft is ramping up on the benefits of owning Activision now\n\nBut also, I bet Activision would push back on having their games on Game Pass cuz they'd lose out on sales\n\nThey're certainly ramping up something, such as their layoff numbers 😂 /s\n\nBlack Ops?\n\nBlack Ops 2\n\nDidn't 1 also have something similar? Was it more blue/white and not yellow?\n\nOf course we didn't prepare you for this growing up. None of _us_ experienced it growing up because online video games at this scale didn't exist.\n\nBo2 was the best COD\n\nUnreal Tournament 1999:\n\nYounger kids today would not be prepared for these old-school lobbies.\n\nEdit: To be clear- I'm not roasting the younger generation. For those that haven't been around, CoD lobbies were brutal.\n\nAbsolutely every one in the lobby had a mic and you would be immediately roasted for next to no reason. It could be your gamertag or the sound of your voice, which is nothing new...\n\nBut, the thing about it was that sometimes the toxicity was pretty clever or downright fucked up that you wouldnt believe. Not the average shit talking today that sounds like \"You're trash, *racial slur*, Git Gud\" and so on.\n\nI sure do miss squeakers yelling racial slurs and mom jokes.\n\nJust play Rainbow Six Siege now\n\nThere wasn’t a single lobby on mw2 that wasn’t “toxic”, idk why, I played cod4, waw, mw2, mw3 and bo1, and only mw2 was the most virulent one hahaha\n\nMW2 was notably the moment gaming became ultra mainstream imo. Playing games at school in my experience went from nerd behavior to jock hobby—as long as it was Madden and MW2.\n\nCoD4 and Halo 3 were pretty universal at my school\n\nI'll never forget hearing one of the most popular dudes in the school talking about OBLIVION with some football players once.\n\nDid we play the same games? I don't think I've been in a CoD lobby that wasn't toxic, regardless of subtitle. \n\nI dropped the series around BO2 and came back for the 2019 MW, still just as racist and toxic as it ever was. And that's coming from a hardcore MOBA player!\n\nBack in 99 and 2000 online computer gaming wasn't terribly toxic. There was some toxicity for sure but out of 60 players in a lobby for Delta Force it would be 1 or 2 people. Unless you went to the Novalogic pub lobbies, it was a lot more there because nobody was enforcing server rules.\n\nI remember playing online servers for FPS games from about 2002-2007 and slowly toxic things creeped in so slow I only really noticed it near the end, I remember when it was seen as a bad thing to do to kill a AFK player in a FPS and games even had a icon that indicated a player was AFK,  then suddenly the icon made someone an easy target with people standing in front of you then shooting you and then mocking you.\n\nI saw it as when online gaming became more mainstream and affordable it went from enthusiasts to younger players, I remember playing a console CoD about 6 years ago and having to switch off chat as all I could hear was kids laughing and making lame insults.\n\nAnd even the toxicity was engaging and inclusive. \n\n# *FUCK! THATS A 50 DKP MINUS! WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT SHIT?!*\n\nIf it makes you feel any better I still hear gay slurs, racial slurs and sexist slurs in a lot of games.\n\nBro these kids are just as nasty as we used to be, you just avoid them now because you ain’t them\n\nI was telling some college age guys about some of the fucked up shit I heard on Xbox live in 2010 and they didn’t believe me.\n\nAll the gen z made 9/11 memes I saw yesterday clearly disproves this idea.\n\nr/lewronggeneration\n\nits all deathmatch now\n\nI literally hear this picture\n\nHow I miss black ops 2\n\nConcord would kill for those numbers\n\nConcord *was* killed for those numbers\n\nPain\n\nI can't believe my parents never prepared me for smaller online Call of Duty lobbies 😭\n\nThe march of time comes for us all eventually.\n\nDamn... I was just talking about cod WaW days. Miss my clan. We'd dominate CTF and had plenty of sleepless nights!\n\n[deleted]\n\nLaughs in Quake 3 Arena... RA3, Threewave..\n\nHalo :(\n\nMake cod bo2 alive again\n\nI would love a remake of black ops 2\n\ni wish i could go back to 2008 / early 2010 with my current self for a few hours a week to play online gaming...  \nHalo 3 multi and infection forge, Cod 4, World at war, gears of war 2. my god the memories of it all.......\n\nCTF was and is the best mode, if done right and is balanced. Unreal Tournament was so much fun playing this game mode.\n\nMe watching the final grand tour episode ;-;"

    "all_comment_text": "For a mobile game, 12 i years is a lot.\n\n[removed]\n\nI haven't thought about that game in 6 years until it randomly popped into my head earlier today and i considered downloading again.\n\nWhelp. Nevermind.\n\nSame. I even checked out the subreddit a few weeks ago and reminisced about all the old events and posts.\n\nI remember that snake day event. So many people played it and there was a buddy system with excel sheets and I remember leaving messages for people with my decorations. Good times.\n\nI wonder how much money it made\n\nEdit: how the fuck is this my highest voted comment?\n\nEnough that I stopped playing after 6 months because it was a wait or pay game.\n\nback in the day it really wasn’t too bad, i completed it up to the available content at the time without spending a penny\n\nI also played when it came out over a few months. I remember unlocking most of it and turned it off and never on again haha.\n\nI remember getting to the point where I unlocked the corn and it said something like \"It's corn! Wait 90 days to harvest, just like the real thing!\" I laughed, and uninstalled right away.\n\nI remember the corn thing too but instead calculated that I had 90 days until I left for a vacation so used it as a countdown. That was 2013.\n\n\"Oh its my vacation! time to harvest my corn.\"\n\nYeah that was the classic “leap of faith” most F2P games take.\n\nThe first few chapters let you fly through content without difficulty and then they drop a massive timesink or obstacle to overcome.\n\nSome are masters at making you want to stick around (Hoyoverse games) but many fail.\n\nGenshin failed to get me after a few months but star rail is just too damn fun and the story is a lot more interesting to me.\n\nI had a hacked version on Android that gave me infinite premium currency.  So I also never spent a penny\n\nI did the same on iOS with early jailbreaks. Thanks Cydia! :)\n\nthis was the only reason i jailbroke my iphone 5c. after that it opened a pandora’s box for other games to get free stuff in!\n\nR/freedonuts\n\nr/freedonuts is the reason I joined Reddit.\n\nThe game was extremely moddable, at least on Android. With the right APK installed, you could get unlimited everything along with some exclusive items made by modders. The crazy thing is, it was like that for years and I don't remember EA doing anything about it. Oh, you have 2485472710 donuts on your account? Understandable, have a great day.\n\nThey explicitly name-dropped Reddit in the game with a joke about getting free donuts. Been a while so I forgot exactly what the line was.\n\nInternet off, date and time, skip 2 days, reap rewards. Those were the times man.\n\nI remember I installed a hacked APK and ran it from an emulator on my PC because I was so tired of waiting for stuff haha. It did mean that I completed the game in 2 days tho. I basically just played it like SimCity haha.\n\nIt was, but was also a very easy game to play with hacks or similar options. To this date, the only game I’ve ever ‘cheated’ in any way to get a ton of extra items, since the benefits of premium items were really exponential and i found the game a lot more fun with them (compared to others where it just gets boring).\n\nObviously goes without saying that I’d only ever consider cheating in a game that wasn’t competitive because I’m not an asshole.\n\nCompetitive mobile games are like money burning contests\n\nI'm more curious how much money someone is going to have just shut down. \n\nLike is there someone who has sunk $100,000 into this game and everything just gets turned off and its gone?\n\nYeah pretty much. It happens with gacha games pretty regularly.\n\nThere was a guy who spent his family’s savings, something close to that amount, while racking up $800 per month just on ff brave exvius. They were in debt for thousands. The wife found out when their credit cards were vastly overdrawn and couldn’t pay for groceries.\n\nHe eventually had to go to gamblers anonymous.\n\nThat whale tale from FFBE was a roller coaster, like casually dropping 1k on a banner while at a sea park with his family because the itch and he couldn’t pull the pixels he wanted\n\nI have a friend who started a gacha game on facebook, I heard that there were a few folks who spent 50K+ on lootboxes looking for a sepcific thing and never got it (Support always reached out at that point and said there was a bug and gave it to them....) \n\nThey did that a few times a year\n\nGacha games seriously need to be better regulated. Loot boxes too. I say this as someone currently playing 3 gachas. They’re so fucking predatory.\n\nThey made at least a thousand off me. I was obsessed with it for a period.\n\nA thousand!? Jesus Christ!\n\nI don't think my lifetime app purchases have hit four digits and I started back when you needed an $80 app for GPS navigation on an iPhone.\n\nI haven't even spent $1,000 on DLC in my lifetime\n\nI started when you manically mashed \"end call\" button if you accidentally tapped internet and I haven't spent over $20 on apps.\n\nYeah, the only other super old mobile game that's still going I can think of is Clash of clans.\n\nMy singing monsters is still receiving new content pretty regularly. This month is its 12th anniversary and it shows no signs of slowing down\n\nSummoners War still bringing in millions each month, currently having its 10yr anv event\n\nCandy Crush\n\nSimCity BuildIt\n\nDokkan battle almost there\n\nJust fell to my knees in Walmart\n\nJust saw a dude fall to his knees in Walmart\n\nI just saw a dude fall to his knees out back behind the Walmart.\n\nIt's true, I was the knees.\n\nIt’s true, I was the Walmart.\n\nYou guys have a walmart?\n\nJust watched a dude watching another dude fall to his knees in Walmart\n\nWher were u when simpsons was kill\n\nno\n\nI was eating dorito wen phon ring\nsimpson ded\nNo\n\n*Who needs the Tapped Out game*\n\n\n*I dooooo*\n\nJust fell to my knees in Kwik-E-Mart\n\nOdd way to crop the \"hand\" in the sky.\n\nThat’s no hand baby….\n\nIt looks like a giant...\n\nDick! Dick, take a look out the starboard. \n\nDick: oh my god, it looks like a huge…\n\n... Pecker! Wait... That's not a woodpecker it looks like someone's...\n\nPRIVATES!

What have you got there?  \n\nDon’t know sir, it’s shaped like an oversized ...\n\n… Johnson!\n\nI think it's Nelson, just waiting for the laugh\n\nr/theyknew\n\nUsername checks out\n\nJust noticed the crop as well lol. They have this as their Facebook profile picture.\n\nNo one tell them\n\nThey know\n\nThey know\n\nBountiful PENIS?\n\nI remember my parents had a nasty divorce and one of the few ways I could contact my dad was going to his springfield and reading messages he arranged with bushes lol. Donuts for all 🍩🍻\n\nreminds me when my parents got a divorce, i couldn’t contact my dad so he bought an xbox and pretended to me my 12 year old friend, whenever my mom would walk into the room i’d be like “yeah man school was horrible today i agree” stuff like that.\n\n[deleted]\n\nMeanwhile my dad bought me an NES for my 6th birthday.  But what he didn't tell me was that he secretly played it for weeks before giving it to me so he could beat me at Super Mario Bros.\n\nThat is rough when you are a dad.  I started playing the card game Sushi Go against my daughter.   First time, I took it easy.   Second time it started to get close.   Third time I legit started trying hard.  I think around the fifth or sixth game I got legit beat by my 10 year old and I was playing her as hard as I could.  I kind of expected that I would just keep steamrolling her all weekend when I brought the game out.\n\nAt the same time it's gotta feel so amazing that your child is clever enough to do that.  Those kinda things are when you know maybe you got some of it right, haha.\n\nMust be mom's genes.\n\nLmaooo I can so imagine myself being the dad who uses my kid's gifts in the weeks leading up to the occasion and never saying a word 💀\n\n\"Wow dad, swinging this bat feels like I'm holding nothing at all!\"\n\n\"I know right that shit is cra-...I mean, I can only imagine kiddo!\"\n\nThese days as a parent you have to fire up the game to download all the patches so your kiddos get that same “fresh out of the box” experience\n\nThere's usually fights on the Nintendo Switch sub on if parents should be doing that.\n\nPersonally, I think parents should pre-open stuff like that for the reasons you mentioned.  There's also the aspect of making sure everything in the box works and setting up accounts/parental controls.\n\nThinking on it, the box itself doesn't really matter.  It doesn't have to look brand new.\n\nTrue dad move.\n\nNah that’s hilarious 😂\n\nDunno if you need to hear this or not, but man, fuck your other parent for cutting off your dad like that.\n\nI was upset at her for a long time because of it, but learning the details of the divorce later on made me forgive her and somewhat resent my dad.\n\nPeople can be a good parent and a horrible spouse. People are complex like that.\n\nThey don't have to love each other.  They just need to love and support you.\n\nLol with no context, just “fuck that person”. What if there was domestic abuse? What if they had abused a child? \n\nReddit takes are wild.\n\n“I don’t know if you need to hear this but fuck your mom” lmao\n\nFuck man. This is literally me right now. She cuts off contact so I go into Minecraft and Roblox to make shit for him to see.\n\nHope it gets better soon. I know that’s rough\n\nThank you man. I’m happy you and your father got though that mess\n\nMay I ask how your relationship is now? Me and my son game avidly. Worried about something like this in the future with mom.\n\nFor some context her family has heavy influence and does not like me.  They have money.  She has completely cut me off.  Often, she will find out what games we play together and have my account banned or blocked.  I haven't seen him physically in almost two years (he's 11) now.  I don't have much help financially. I have been saving for a lawyer because that is my only option at this point.\n\nSorry to hear that man, stay strong!\n\nHang in there, brother. Dad hug.\n\nIf you're a minor, which I'm guessing you are based on your comment, you may want to look into whether there's any near by organizations that gives legal help to minors. Where I live, albeit mostly only in exceptional cases, the courts will let minors be a party (i.e: let them be involved) in parenting cases, and there's a society here that gives free legal counsel to minors for that purpose.\n\nYour laws and resources may be very different, but a good parenting arrangement is a right of the child where I am, and our courts will let children sometimes voice their wants to ensure their rights are being protected.\n\nTry searching \"Legal Counsel for Youth Washington\" (or whatever state, province, country, you are in. Or \"Child and Youth Legal Center \\[State\\]\". If you find something, it likely won't hurt to give them a call to see if they can help.\n\nI'm sorry this is happening to you. It's awful when a parent alienates kids from the other parent.\n\nI can see how you thought I was the child in this situation.  I am the father, I'm in my late 30's.  It has been hard even talking about this so I may come off differently.\n\nAhh my bad; I just took the context incorrectly. Nothing you said was wrong.   \n  \nStill the same sentiment - it's horrible for a child when they're taken away from a loving parent; makes the separation all the more difficult when an important adult is just cut out. And obviously as the father, it's just as bad.\n\nNot nearly as potent as the resource for minors, but there's dad groups out there that provide support for what you are going through. Might help finding some like-minded fathers who are going through, or have gone through, similar experiences, even if it is just to vent.\n\nYou can write notes in empty books. I used to do that to my husband. Just a random chest in the middle of his build with a book that says love you!\n\nYour ex is an animal.\n\nThat’s… uh… are you doing okay?\n\nThat was 12 years ago, I’m 23 now and me and my dad play online games (and talk) regularly. All good lol\n\nthe Good ending\n\nI’m glad to hear it :)\n\nI'm glad you are doing well, because your comment broke my heart.\n\nThat's so shitty for you and your father.  As a divorce and child custody lawyer, you have my sympathy.\n\nYeah man, seriously- unless it's a case of abuse demanding your child cut off contact with the other parent during a divorce is the shittiest of behaviors.\n\nHurting your child to hurt your soon to be ex.\n\n[deleted]\n\nHoly shit, my dad's been playing this daily for as long as I can remember. This is gonna be brutal.\n\nIf you don't mind, could you give us an update after the news is broken to him? I'm curious to how a long-term user would react\n\nCheck out r/tappedout , we’re all devastated\n\ndamn i just found out about this game and this sub and i'm devasted too\n\n\"Ahhhhhhh!! 😪\" I remember him checking in daily to farm money, and his town was massive and included enough donut generation to never need to buy them. Rip\n\nAs someone who played for six years, stopped, and then picked it up again during the pandemic and has been a semi-daily player? It sucks. I feel lost, I’m not sure what to do with all the time this will unlock.\n\nMaybe I’ll build a sailing vessel, arr.\n\nMy dad has been playing since launch, the first thing he said was it was the worst news he received since he learned princess Diana died.\n\nWell, I’ve been playing this daily for 7 years and I’ll tell you that it sucks. \n\nI never paid money, but I enjoyed progressing, reading the story and leveling things up. \n\nThe unlimited characters were cool, and I had fun messing around with the world. \n\nThis one will hurt a lot and I’ll miss the game a great deal.\n\nDamnit my corn was just about to grow.\n\nI hate it when I hit corn instead of moonshine\n\nI always grew corn. A long time without having to worry about and when it did grow, big paycheck\n\nThat's the thing about this game. While it was a big payout for the long term, you got more in the long run if you kept up short term harvests. Because that kept you constantly coming back to the game and maintaining engagement.\n\nI was really into the game for a while and my town was looking pretty nice. But the constant need to keep coming back day after day, and the constant temptation to spend real money became too much. So while I sometimes miss the game, I don't miss the daily grind.\n\nPaul Newman’s gonna have my legs broke!\n\n[removed]\n\n[removed]\n\n[removed]\n\n[removed]\n\n[removed]\n\nPlayed this obsessively when it came out.bouht a boatload of doughnuts got my town just like I wanted and stopped because it became impossible to get everything free to play .was a great little time sink rip my dear Springfield \n\nThe tipping point for me came from amassing an obscene amount of wailing walls during a halloween event. It was obviously a glitch. 250 bucks for a wall that gave 2.25% XP bonus. I have no idea how many I bought, I just know it filled half my map, and very quickly I was able to level up so many times that I had all the donuts I could ever possibly spend. THATS when it became a bore. I realized by getting every item, not really earning them etc, I had taken kind of the fun and value away from the items I earned grinding the game. \n\nIt really was a fantastic little mobile game. My wife yelled at me about it constantly.\n\nIt's interesting seeing what, if any parts of mobile games hold up if you take away the microtransaction element.\n\nJust last week I jailbroke a first gen iPad my wife's father gave us that had been sitting in a drawer for years because it can no longer connect to the App store.\n\nI decided to install all the old delisted mobile games from that era (the last update the first gen iPad got was iOS 5.1.1), mostly games that you can no longer play except on that old hardware.\n\nAnd one of the games I got was Tiny Death Star. Never actually played it back then, but I remember hearing about it being taken down rather abruptly.\n\nThe game is alright. It's clearly designed to syphon money from the player, but because I literally can't spend money on it anymore because the servers have long since been taken down I only have the free to play experience. You have to settle into the idle game mindset of only playing it for a minute or 2 and then leaving it for a few hours.\n\nThe other games I've added are a combination of other free to play/$0.99 games (Angry Birds, Cut The Rope, Fruit Ninja, Plants Vs. Zombies) and a few that were made by actual gaming companies like EA, etc. before they realized mobile customers simply will not buy games (it's free to play or nothing).\n\nSo stuff like the exclusive Dead Space game, and exclusive Mirror's Edge game, and even a Mass Effect one. All 3 of them are more or less complete games with very little focus on microtransactions.\n\nIt was an interesting era where they were still figuring things out, before the psychological manipulation of free to play stuff had been perfectly honed.\n\nSpeaking of filling your map, during the 2013 Whacking Day event you could get snake eggs for whacking a snake, and then you could leave them in your friends towns if you wanted. I was a member of an online forum where 30-40 of us played, and if you needed some eggs you could request and people would log in and give them to you.\n\nI asked for some, logged off and promptly forgot about the game for about 24 hours. I came back and discovered that the forum had decided to prank me, and EVERY SINGLE UNOCCUPIED SQUARE of my Springfield was covered in eggs, except for one spot where they'd written \"HI MORDRED\" in negative space. You couldn't do anything on the land while they were there so I had to open every single one and then whack the snakes that sometimes came out. Took about two hours to do because the game lagged so bad having that many objects on screen and my HTC ONE couldn't handle it.\n\nWas absolutely hilarious.\n\nI remember having a blast during the Stonecutters event. That was a legit good time, even if you didn’t spend any real money.\n\nLoved this game. Before Donuts became necessary to progress things, then I gave it up. Loved all the little bits of fan service strewn throughout.\n\nI remember I found r/freedonuts and someone logged into my account and gave me like 50k in donuts  I lived like a king\n\nI played for a few months then also found that sub. Quit soon after as I got bored with it. Did similar pattern with that Family Guy game that was out around the the same time period. Haven't played any phone games since then.\n\nI played until I was dumb a nuked my town cause I wanted to redesign then was like why did I do this. So I stopped, I play a bunch of different phone games though usually for a month or so then find something else\n\nYeah I haven't played since Donuts were deemed necessary to get through the game.\n\nBy now it's actually easy to obtain donuts through daily challenges etc. If you play it regularly you can easily buy those 200 donut houses with not too much grind\n\nWould be crazy if it got a steam port with offline mode I would honestly pay for it\n\nVery unlikely to happen. It's a licenced game where the publisher doesn  't own the intellectual property so an official offline version is unlikely.\n\nThere might be pirate hacked versions ( in fact there definitely is) but it won't go up on steam.\n\nEA has had blanket rights to Simpsons in games for ages and ages, and there's no news about them losing the rights wholesale to someone else, so it's more possible than you'd think.\n\nGranted, Tapped Out is the only thing they've done with it since roughly when the movie came out, but... this seems like a \"player count's dwindling and there's almost nothing new to add\" shutdown, not a \"oh god oh fuck we're losing the rights\" one.\n\nMy mom has been playing this game ever since it came out and she was so sad to learn this I can't believe it myself. she absolutely loved this game and she played it every day. she literally had everything and was leveled up as high as you could go. she told me that the game would never end unless of the series was ending\n\nI think she even talked to developers a couple times and I think the developers said that it would never end unless the Simpsons ended, I'm not sure if that's going to be true but if it is she probably would be devastating to her as she loves The Simpsons too, though she does like the older ones more than the newer ones\n\nI have vivid memories of having this game on my iPod touch when I was in elementary school and being woken up to a loud “D’OH!” it used as a notification sound that would scare the shit out of me at least once a week.\n\nSame, I was once in class and a loud D'OH came out of my pocket interrupting the whole class. I was so embarrassed lol.\n\nMy dad used to yell at me for not turning notifications off.\n\n\nEither homer saying \"better them than me\" or the gross \"space mutant\" noise were particularly memorable\n\nMy brother and I both had the game and had to triple check that our phones were on silent when we went to a funeral. There was a very real fear of suddenly hearing \"Better them than me!\".\n\nI learned how to glitch the game for unlimited donuts probably 10 years ago from a YT video.. I felt like a god, must be how whales feel all of the time.\n\nI missed the last Stonecutter reward by less than an hour and never went back, can't believe that was 12 years ago\n\nr/mildlypenis\n\n/r/wildlypenis\n\nBro why is there a giant dong in the sky?\n\nNed Flanders is skydiving.\n\nFeels like he’s wearing nothin’ at all, nothin’ at all,  \n\n**NOTHIN’ AT ALL**\n\nStupid sexy Flanders!\n\nWell, I'm not going to unsee that\n\nColonel, you’d better take a look at this radar.\n\nUghhhh I was just thinking about getting into this game!\n\nI literally just re-downloaded it last night ! Lmao\n\nYou caused this 🤣\n\nI re-downloaded this game about 6 months ago after not having touched it for...jesus, the better part of a decade. \n\nThey never deleted my springfield. haha\n\nI got back into it mid August, now I'm level 23 with all my work being for nothing 🥲\n\nI remember playing this in college a decade ago, good times until I got sick of the waiting.\n\nThe upside is this means there's a chance of a brand new real deal Simpsons game being made.\n\n16 years since the last real game came out for the movie.\n\nThe chances of Hit and Run 2 are rising up from 0.\n\nThe chance of a Simpsons world in KH2 still near 0.\n\nThe only mobile game I’ve ever spent real $$$ on.\n\nNow remake hit and run. \n\n That's sad news! I'll miss it.\n\nSame. Been playing for a long time. Was just a good time waster for work. Setting jobs up for 4 hours knowing I have 4 hours left.\n\nIsn't this the game that that one South Park episode about Freemium games was making fun of? I know they used T&amp;P as stand ins, but it was pretty obviously Simpsons:Tapped Out, right?\n\nThe game makes fun of itself in its own opening scene.\n\nYeah this was definitely the game they were referring to. \n\n\nWhile it wasn't the only game that got popular using this format it was by large the most popular and long lasting. \n\nOh damn I completely forgot about this game but now I am remembering how excited I’d get for seasonal updates (Halloween, Christmas) to deck out Springfield with decorations followed by the absolute dread of having to clean it up all after the season ended lol\n\nI've been playing this daily for the better part of 2024. Absolutely heartbroken\n\nI’ve been playing it daily since it came out.\n\nI played it in 2012 but fell off after a few months. I picked it back up in 2023 and have been playing daily for a year and a half. A rare game where there are zero ads and paying money helps but absolutely isn't necessary.\n\nWhat’s with the huge cock’n’balls in the sky?\n\n[deleted]\n\nOne of my favorite mobile Games😭😭 I've never maxed It but i restarted at least 20 times for how much i loved that game\n\n[deleted]\n\nHopefully they get away from this microtransaction-driven game style, and get back to making REAL Simpsons games again.\n\nI would love another open-world Simpsons game like Hit and Run.\n\nMake it very interactive, with lots of episode-style quests.  Maybe throw in some quests that relive classic episodes of the show.  \n\nAs an open world game, you could mix several kinds of gameplay styles.  You could do a racing mode.  I think it would be a lot of fun to have a Sprinfield-wide Battle Royale (PUBG style), where you can pick any Simpsons character from a huge list.\n\nThis sucks. This is like the only mobile game I play\n\nAw man, I just got back into this game a few months ago\n\nI played this for years, there was a glitch/exploit that got your player max level with blood vans, I did that got a ton of donuts played for a few more months and then gave it up, but I enjoyed it for a good 2-3 years.\n\nRemember: if you need an internet connection to run the game, you will probably lose everything in it eventually.\n\nI learned this lesson with Marvel Heroes 2016."

It's a great movie even if you didn't watch it as a kid and have nostalgia goggles.\n\nMy towns local theatre screened it during the summer for their annual summer classics movies and seeing it in a sold out theatre for my first time seeing it was awesome. People were hollering the whole movie and gave a standing ovation at the end.\n\nHe killed my father.\n\nPrepare to die.\n\nBut what is your name\n\nINIGO MONTOYA BITCH!!!\n\nINCONCEIVABLE!\n\nYou keep using this word, I don't think you know what it means\n\nHave you any idea how little that narrows it down?\n\nAnybody want a peanut?\n\nstop rhyming! I mean it!\n\nOrange one, please.\n\nAs you wish.\n\n“Do you always begin conversations like this?”\n\nIt is only my father was slaughtered by a six-fingered man.\n\nStop saying that!\n\nSomeone was looking for you.\n\n*BONK*\n\nThank you for saying this. I was staring at the image and had no clue. Once again the Princess Bride saved me from embarrassment.\n\nNever go up without the Princess Bride when embaresment is on the line!\n\nTruly you have a dizzying intellect!\n\nWait till I get going!\n\n\nWhere was I?\n\nAustralia\n\nIts its conceivable!!!\n\nDammit ! Ruined . \n\nIts inconceivable!!!  \nShit i couldnt save it\n\nHaha, this guy had no clue! What an embarrassment lol XD\n\nI think cod has left many sons and daughters fatherless….\n\nSix fingers for Black Ops 6. Maybe an allusion to the Left 4 Dead hand (but probably just AI generation).\n\nThis confuses the Germans\n\nHö? Why?  \nI am German and was not confused. Do you mean the word \"allusion\"? This also exists in the German language. I had to think for a moment about what that was again, but the word wasn't new to me.\n\nGermany had different box art because of censorship\n\nYes, but the depiction of the hand with four fingers remained the same. It was just toned down a little in public stores. On Steam, however, the \"cover\" is the (as far as I know) normal representation of the hand:\n\n[https://ibb.co/vD1NBkQ](https://ibb.co/vD1NBkQ)\n\nSo germans understands the allusion nevertheless.\n\nA German explaining why someone else's joke is factually incorrect is somehow more funny than any other nationality doing the same.\n\nI'm pleased to have made you happy.\n\nDanke\n\nI am pleased to have heard your joke and even more pleased to have understood it. \nAlso, I was on time to work today. \nDidn’t speak to anyone.\n\nits his german given right\n\ndisagreeable vanish punch jellyfish plant head ancient observation squeal different\n\nMost german response ever XD\n\nNo doubt if they read this they'll be \"that's our out, we're saved\" it was just an homage guys!!!\n\nEdit: fixed a typo\n\nThat said, it could easily be the case too.\n\nA coincidence or intentional, people won't believe it though with how AI makes mistakes.\n\nI honestly thought that it was his finger skin falling down from the pinkie, and not that he had 6 fingers. But yeah, it seems like AI\n\nNo, I am pretty sure you are right - the pinky without the skin is darker, red-ish and you can see some \"strands\" holding the skin there.\n\n[deleted]\n\nCOD player here. It's AI generated. Not only have activison been subliminally using AI for art in BO6 for making calling cards, emblems, and promotional art (none of which steam's ToS have called them out for being unannounced btw), but BO6 also just replaced multiple in-game voice actors because they didn't agree to let AI be trained by their voices for future use, one of these voice actresses having been with the company for 15 years (about since WaW), and she's been there since the start of COD's zombies mode (which this \"art\" is from). A lot of fans are upset. \n\nTLDR: Activison yet again showing people they don't deserve support because they don't respect their fans, or even their own employees who actually MAKE these games.\n\nLOL no.\n\nIn the full image he has two thumbs on his other hand and the gift wrap just morphs in to nothing.\n\nIt's shit AI.\n\nAh yes, AI generated loading screens lol\n\nFor $9.99, I'll photoshop that 6th finger out.\n\nFor the first three months. Then only $14.99 per month thereafter.\n\nThat’s only half the price of 1 skin, you’re selling yourself short\n\nIt's not AI generated though.\n\n\nIt's the skin falling of the fifth finger to make a 6th for Black Ops 6.\n\n\nJust think for a second.\n\nFound the guy in charge of Reddit’s brain cell for today\n\nBe nice if the hand was in focus to emphasise that more.\n\nPlus the weird choice to have the face in focus, the hand out of focus and the blood in front of the hand in focus again.\n\nAh yes a throwback to my favorite gaming series, Left 6 Dead.\n\nThey could have put more focus on the hand so it's not so blurry and difficult to distinguish\n\nI think you're giving them a little too much credit. This is Activision/Blizzard we're talking about. It's most likely AI generated.\n\nOrrrr it's because it's Black Ops 6?\n\n3000+ devs using ai to gen loading screens with 6 fingers. Where is the QC lol\n\nQA is the bottom most tier of game devs and are the first to get fired when anything remotely inconvenient happens. \n\nThis is the kind of shit that happens when companies don't care about QA\n\nImagine selling as many copies of call of duty and they can’t even pay $500 to an artist to paint a loading screen\n\nYou don't become filthy rich by having a conscience.\n\nThis feels like a quote that 100% describes our current timeline.\n\nIf by current timeline you mean \"throughout all of witnessed and observed history including the times in which it was not described that way, because the only histories that survive their respective centuries are ones approved by the usurping power structure that comes after\", then yes.\n\nOk but that doesn’t fit on a shirt well.\n\nIt'd wrap around the back and under the arms.  \n\nMaybe we could get AI to solve it!  \n\nWait...\n\nPlease google Rockefeller and J.P. Morgan. They’re the ones who set the tone.\n\nAlthough it also could have been Mansa Musa…\n\nUHC CEO entered the ch…. Nvm\n\nWhat do you mean, that's clearly him dressed as Santa in the top image.\n\n[removed]\n\nI can't even play Warzone currently because I configured a loadout that breaks the game or something. I just get a never ending looping loading or update screen that never progresses.\n\nI honestly don't even give a shit at this point. They keep making the experience of playing the game worse and worse.\n\n500 more dollars for them if they let people cry about it and buy their game anyways.\n\n\nMoney is the only thing they understand and consumers are too fucking stupid to use their power to actually change the things they dont like.\n\nYour average cod player doesn't give a shit about that\n\n[deleted]\n\nBuddy of mine worked for Ubisoft and it was a similar thing. A lot of bugs that he found were on a \"do not fix/don't care\" list.\n\nThe only exception to this was when he was working on a Nintendo game (Mario+Rabbids), then everything was on the table and needed fixing before it shipped. Say what you will about Nintendo but their games fucking work day 1\n\nIt’s not a stretch to imagine Nintendo keeping Ubisoft on a tight leash with those games, but seeing it spelled out so obviously is honestly hilarious.\n\nThat game is up there on my internal list of games I wish we had a full making of documentary a’la PsychOdyssey for.\n\nI had never heard of PsychOdyssey and I fucking love Psychonauts. Just gave me a must watch!.\n\nIt’s one of my favorite documentaries period, by far the best video game related one out there.\n\nI’ve watched it twice, once alone, and once with my wife.  And I…. Still haven’t finished Psychonauts 2.  😅. I plan on it soon though, as soon as the urge to watch the documentary hits again.\n\nAlso Mario + Rabbids was fucking legit.\n\nOne of the biggest positive surprises I think I ever had in gaming. I admittedly had rather low expectations, but I was blown away!\n\nSame. My gf at the time wanted to get me a cheap game for valentines day and asked the dude at gamestop for a rec. Thanks random gs employee!\n\nHell yeah it was\n\nUnless its pokemon\n\nI blame that on Nintendo having to share the IP for Pokémon with other companies, whereas they have full control over things like Mario.\n\nYup, they've taken that approach for decades. The Nintendo seal of quality was instrumental in the video gaming industry *in general* surviving past the 80's.\n\nContrary to popular belief, it did not mean \"good game\"\n\nIt meant \"*Playable* game\".\n\nI’ve marked many bugs as “do not fix.”\n\nSometimes there will be small, ankle high rocks with collision disabled. Yes, grenades can freely pass through them but so can the player. I’d prefer that brief moment that breaks immersion than a camera that’s bobbing each time a player goes over gravel. \n\nAt the end of development there are X number of bugs, Y number of devs, and Z number of days left. The goal is to get X as low as possible, so low priority bugs get closed and the team can focus on more important stuff.\n\nNot saying it’s a great system, but it’s the nature of the beast in a production setting. Tell your friend the “do not fix” resolutions weren’t personal.\n\nHey I was there back in 99-01! The basement playing everquest on after the shift was over!\n\nI used to work QA for EA and we would always get trash talked by the devs. We would call out big bugs and they would get shipped lol. There was one QA guy that got fired cause he made a video as soon as the game was launched high lighting all the shipped bugs lol\n\nI am in QA management and I can say, slowly, we are changing the attitude. My team is highly skilled and can get whatever the Devs want. Unfortunately some of the old guard still like to trash us for finding how broken their code is.\n\nIsn’t…. That the job? You are supposed to work co-op with the devs to make the best product possible. I wish I had someone qualified to triple check my work sometimes. \n\nLink to the vid?\n\nI worked at Activision during MW2 and the bug base had like 60k will not fix bugs in it, many of which ended up being well known exploits lol.\n\nI worked at Novalogic when we released F-22 Lightning II and we shipped it with 450 bugs on the “A” list (gotta meet that ship date for the publisher!). It was so buggy that all tech support (hi! 🙋‍♀️) could do was take down people’s information to send them a whole new updated CD when we patched it. It was 1996ish, and most people only had slow modems, so telling them to download a gigantic patch just wasn’t really an option (especially in the era of long-distance calling).\n\nThen I got a job at Interplay doing online community stuff, and we shipped Descent to Undermountain — and all we could do was apologize, seriously. Kobolds floating in mid-air, fucked up physics all over… it was just so buggy and unplayable. 🤦‍♀️ We got well-deserved thrashings from the can’t-playerbase. \n\nI will say in the defense of some devs and QA teams that sometimes, you just don’t know how something’s going to go after launch. Despite the best efforts of very talented and diligent people, stuff just behaves differently in the wild. Sometimes they get forced to ship because they’re contractually bound to a milestone and delivery schedule and people’s livelihoods are on the line if it doesn’t get out the door. I saw it go all sorts of ways and no doubt it still does — but it seems even worse.\n\nThat sounds about right. Assuming you’re talking about 2022, I remember losing my mind at a single truck window on Santa Seña that simply could not shatter or be shot through. Came back to the game months later and it was still there, every other car window on the map could be broken with no issues.\n\nI’m no game dev, but I took a few classes in HS, and in every engine I ever worked with that was literally a toggle that could be selected after clicking on the object. I think I genuinely could have fixed that one for them if they’d let me RDP in for 2 minutes lol.\n\nOh this was during the original 360 release. We also tested one of the transformer games which was really fun but one character was super unbalanced and they wouldn’t fix it until we did a multiplayer test with the devs and all picked that character and just steamrolled them the entire play test lmao. That’s one of my favorite memories from that place. Working 12 hour days 7 days a week wasn’t fun but the people were cool. Outside the producers of course. \n\nThat’s hilarious haha. Glad you gleaned something from the experience.\n\n&gt;I worked at Activision during MW2 and the bug base had like 60k will not fix bugs in it,\n\nMakes sense. If i remember right when Infinity ward and Microsoft had their little tantrums with one another, you guys couldn't get shit done at all. \n\nRemember someone saying they had a lot of bugfixes ready to push onto client, but you never could actually do anything because Activision/Microsoft wouldn't allow you guys to push updates.\n\nI work on a team of Dev‘s as a project manager. I was just talking to one of the lead dev managers who is extremely talented coder and we were joking and laughing about how even the very biggest companies just trust one individual to do something and no one checks it. That’s why there’s so much crap and bugs out there.\n\nYou'll be glad to know this isn't the case in a lot of engineering industries.\n\nI work in QA (not video games) and it's like that everywhere it feels.\n\nWhy bother with checking for quality when the executives need a Christmas bonus? \n\nUh I work as a QA engineer and definitely not the case at any of the companies I've worked for. Guess I've been lucky.\n\nPeople need to stop buying games that use ai to cut corners or the quality is going to continue to get worse and worse\n\nIt's not going to happen with franchises like CoD. It's too big to fail on a purely ideological stance.\n\n\nIt's a franchise full of virtue signaling  that *still* attracts the conservative crowd *and* panders to it. It's a wide audience mammoth\n\nI used to work QA for Namco Bandai 15 years ago. Terrible job and glad I was laid off, because it led to my eventual career job.\n\nused to work QA, can confirm, first to get the hatchet when cuts are to come.\n\nthen they'll ask why people are complaining about why their games are so shit and buggy, proceed to fire a bunch of their workforce due to lack of sales, then with the money they're \"saving\" they'll give it to the execs.\n\nfuck corporations.\n\nLaid off QA here, you're 110% correct\n\nWhen things go well, they also get fired.\n\n&gt; This is the kind of shit that happens when ~~companies~~ consumers don't care about QA\n\nFTFY since this game made over $1bn in sales in the first 10 days and is the most successful game in the franchise's history\n\nIt's black ops 6. 6 fingers. It makes sense.\n\nThat's what I thought too\n\nLeft 6 Dead\n\nLeft 6 Dead Furious\n\nDON'T FAST\n\nOPEN FURIOUS 6\n\naw fuck me I just made the whole connection\n\nThis is so hilarious 😭😭\n\nDrake getting cooked everywhere hahaha\n\nnah bro there's 6 fingers cuz it's black ops 6 😇\n\nTaking the Left for Dead art meme a little far in the wrong direction.\n\nit’s been re-budgeted to fit in some exec’s pocket\n\nSir, zombie santa has one too many fingers.\n\nIt's a zombie, we'll call it a mutation. How's that $12 candy rainbow unicorn weapon wrap coming along?\n\n12? Surely you must mean 25 (and you can only buy in game currency equivalents in 20 dollar increments)\n\nDeny, delay, disfigure\n\n… Denise\n\nQC has been swamped, working overtime with the skins design department.\n\nQC is also Ai.\n\nInteresting. I thought it was because their employees all have 6 fingers so they can better steal customer money, I mean give awesome products, with.\n\nQC has been replaced by AI, obviously\n\nAI looks at AI generated content:\n\n\"I see nothing wrong with this!\"\n\nThat's one way for it to ensure job security.\n\nLook at it closer, the \"sixth finger\" is just skin falling off the 5th finger.\n\n\n\n\nEdit: some people are saying it's a curb in the background which I can't really see, it's too different of a color.\n\nI don't think so, the curb would be parallel to the buildings in the background and therefore would be converging, but eyeballing it looks like they won't converge.\n\nThe curb also wouldn't be blurry. Biggest tell is where it converges with the hand, you can see it is front of the red fabric that is on the backside of the arm.\n\nThis could have been removed with photoshop in 10 seconds\n\nThey'd have to pay someone to do that.\n\nNot if they use AI!\n\nThe ironic thing is that all the competent AI art people on the websites for that..... use photoshop to fix their images. The AI is just the first step in the process.\n\nAnd the last step for quick fixes like this. Select the area and use generative fill to remove. Literally a 30s fix.\n\nIronically, no. They can use photoshop AI.\n\nSomeone still needs to select the finger they want removed.\n\nThey could use the same person who created the prompt!\n\nWho is \"they\"? Someone that needs to be paid.\n\nThe same person they paid to type the prompt?\n\nWhy would they need to? It's clearly not AI. The 5th finger is the pinkie bones. The 6th finger is the pinkie's skin.\n\nIf you cut the left most finger and a little bit of the palm it would look ok, if it wasn't used full screen and only something like a calling card they would've gotten away with it but they can't give the least amount of a fuck.\n\nShit!... You might be onto something...\n\npossessive cause cheerful market political sand pathetic attempt consider violet\n\nGuys, its not fair to gang up on this indie dev for choosing to pay artist way less and having to go with A.I. art in order for their boardmembers to meet their $$$ quota.\n\nPoor indie dev Treyarch and their tiny start-up publisher Activision.\n\n\nIt's not easy to get started in this industry. I wish them good luck!\n\nAre we sure it’s not an intentional reference to this being the sixth game\n\nedit: please stop spamming my inbox, I don’t care either way if it’s AI, I was just posing the question \n\nYeah because if you look at the full picture (this is cropped a bit) in the bottom right the ribbons on the presents melt with the wrapping paper and the ribbons aren’t even ribbons. They’re just kinda wavy blob mesh of colors trying to make a ribbon.\n\nto me it doesn’t even look like the “ribbons” are in the middle of the present, how are they supposed to be tied???? such a shame this small dev studio cannot afford greater graphic designers 😔\n\n&gt;graphic designers\n\n\nI'm being nitpicky, but GD's wouldn't create these images, artists would.\n\nalso very obvious is the boxes in the background in front of the wooden \"wall\", the posts are all different lengths and wonky angles.  and the boxes are ..struggling to be boxes\n\nCan you share the full picture?\n\nIt is now..\n\nThat’s a hot take but it’s probably just poor quality control\n\nIf it was like the cover of the game itself then yea sure but just for a loading screen, seems like an oversight\n\n[deleted]\n\nThe hand isn't even in focus lol people are so desperate to excuse shitty companies.\n\nThis isn’t the only AI thing in the game. There’s another one with 7 fingers. I don’t think it’s a reference.\n\n\nEdit: after looking at the image more, that hanging bit *could* be the skin of the pinky if the pinky is in the process of de-gloving. \n\nCould go either way, B.\n\nIt's clearly just an Obake!\n\n(Phasmophobia joke)\n\ncOuLd bE a miMiC\n\n[removed]\n\nIt looks like the finger is de-gloving more than 6 finger AI BS\n\nNow that you mention it that looks exactly what it could be like, I wish it was less blurry though to know.\n\nIf you open it on Xbox on my giant ass tv it’s clear as day that they are both the pinky finger, one’s bone and one’s skin.\n\nAh, yet another case of someone ranting “AI will never match the skill of a human” just for the example to turn out to be a human’s doing.\n\nEven if that is the case, it still remains that the hat is hexagonal for some reason, the eyes have different textures, and the bows on the presents look like MC Escher drawings, all signs of AI being used.\n\nYeah, that's very likely the case, just unfortunately framed.\n\n[deleted]\n\nIsnt that just the ledge to whatever is behind him\n\nI think the 6th finger is actually just the dangling skin / decay from the 5th finger bone. The pinky finger is clearly a different colour than the other 4 indicating bone?\n\nI believe you are right. I wasn't able to find any other indication of AI, with the exception of maybe the eyes\n\nEdit: After a closer, it does have some AI aspects\n\n[deleted]\n\nIt's definitely an AI image. Look at how the white fur and the hand meld together. Look at how wonky the pillars on the balcony are. Are we inside or outside? The \"wall\" (?) looks like indoor wood panelling but the ground looks like snow-on-rock. The square things in the middle are ambiguous - rocks or boxes...? His belt also melts towards the left side. The present wapping makes no sense either.\n\nThe whole face also just screams AI gen even if there aren't any specific flaws.\n\n[deleted]\n\nThey did and it is, the full image has more discrepancies and telltale signs of ai than this cropped version.\n\nPlease stop giving these fuckers money.\n\nI think that's the curb line.\n\ndoesn’t surprise me\n\n[Not AI](https://x.com/ShaneStern/status/1865270356732514751)\n\nQuote if you can't view twitter:\n\n&gt; This art was done by a friend of mine, the incredibly talented Wil Wells. The 6th finger is intentional, but not really a 6th digit. It’s the skin falling off the bone of the pinky, but left to look like a 6th digit as this is the 6th installment of the game. None of this was created with ai.\n\nOf course, it's coming from random twitter guy, but the Wil Wells name checks out\n\nI have 6 fingers and didnt use ai\n\nyou were created in a lab by AI. Sorry you found out this way\n\nStanford?\n\nI have got 10 fingers!\n\nYou can see 4 fingers below the 4 that are raised. This is just the skin falling off the hand. It looks like 6 fingers because only the “extra” pinky is making a clear silhouette.\n\nSo far we have two leading options, \"it's just the curb\" and \"it's just the skin coming off the finger\". So, which one is it?\n\nPeople are saying it's ai which is probably is knowing how easy and cheap it is for companies to do so but after looking at it more thoroughly it just looks like skin peeling off the finger\n\nIt's literally a curb not a finger"

    "all_comment_text": "For context, there was an achievement for doing this in Nier with a similar reaction\n\nAnd for additional clarification/humor value, the achievement is for doing it *ten times*.\n\nIt's literally called \"What are you doing?\"\n\nAside from nier and this game, what other games do this? I'd be too embarrassed and I don't want to get that achievement\n\nI believe Lolipop Chainsaw did it too, I think it was named something along the lines of “It was an accident, I swear!” For looking up the protagonist’s skirt for long enough for it to not be on accident.\n\nAs I recall it's fairly early in the game because it's teaching you camera controls and you have to look up to see something which will inevitably also lead to the \"accident\".\n\nAnd if you didn't get it then, you'd get it when trying to check the top of the stairs for ambushes.\n\nI just ended up getting it during combat. That one knee-slide move is pretty good at decapitating multiple zombies at once if you've already used it to cut off their legs, so I got a slow-mo upskirt and the trophy came up.\n\nI got it randomly during a fight against zombie mobs.\n\nJulie has this awesome chainsaw attack (square + square + x iirc) that just plows through enemies on masse. She does a flip while doing it (looking like a human beyblade) and I guess that's were I got it.\n\nIt's in some top 10 most embarassing achievments or top 10 achievments that are difficult to explain, lol\n\nDo you often find yourself have to explain achievements?\n\n\"I'll take you for this Big Data Analysis post, but first Mister Kailo, can you explain how exactly you got that achievement in your steam profile ?\"\n\nNo, as no one else checks to see my achievments 😅\n\nBut this is a funny one, so I wanted to chime in.\n\nLollipop Chainsaw will forever be engraved in my mind as Jessica Nigiri getting told to change her costume at Pax East because her cosplay was too lewd.\n\nTara Strong is always hilarious\n\nIn Lollipop Chainsaw Juliet pulls her skirt down and covers her butt with her hands if you to this. You also get an achievement, but unlike Nier you only need to do it once to get the achievement so for most people it happens by accident.\n\nYeah bro a total accident\n\nits pretty easy to get the nier automata one accidentally over the course of a playthrough, because you play as her. in nier replicant, though, looking up kaines skirt will make her kick you (much like the video), and if you keep doing it she will literally kill you. you basically have to be doing it intentionally, too, because you dont play as her\n\nThere's \"I did it for the trophy\" from Yakuza 0, which requires you to watch a softcore pr0n tape featuring an irl JAV star (one of many side activities the game has)\n\nAfter it finishes playing, your character sighs while the camera focuses on a box of tissues\n\nYakuza never misses\n\nit's reddit. you can say porn\n\nBut what about the children!\n\nNobody ever says porno anymore. We should bring back porno.\n\nPorn\n\nWhy you looking at prawns in Yakuza?\n\nIn *High on Life*, there's a boss battle where the boss hands you an achievement for \"spending ten hours inside the alien strip club\" and tells you something along the lines of \"explain *that* one to your friends!\"\n\nThat’s actually awesome. \n\nThere’s no achievement for it, but Shadow of the Colossus has a young woman laying on an altar for most of the game. Many players are annoyed when they try to get a closer look at her face and find that the altar is considered a solid object, so the camera will never pass over it and give them a good look. The reason that happens is because the director didn’t want players looking up her dress while she’s comatose/dead.\n\n\"many players\" 🤨\n\n🤔 Yeah this guy is suspicious. Let's get him!\n\n[deleted]\n\n&gt;!&gt;I'm so fucked up.!&lt;\n\nI believe Ashley scolds you if you do it to her in Resident Evil 4.\n\nNormally this only happens if you look up while she's climbing a ladder but it can also happen if Leon gets knocked to the floor by an enemy near her\n\nIn the original game, if you got decapitated by certain enemies and your head rolled under her skirt, she would call you a pervert.\n\nI had Ashley yell at me like that on the Switch version a couple of years ago, from suplexing an enemy when she was standing behind me. I was pretty impressed that the detection is that consistent.\n\nThere are a lot of these types of interactions spread throughout the Metal Gear Solid series.\n\nThe metal gear solid games do it minus achievements\n\nThere’s also an achievement for &gt;!playing as 9s in his shorts post self-destruct for an hour!&lt; called &gt;!”Not that I mind…!&lt;\n\nIt was embarassing to explain the situation to my GF. That I had to do it 10 times and then proceeds to go to 6 and unlock it.\n\nhmmm... i didn't really remember that...\n\nI think a lot of Japanese games that have characters wearing skirts do something like this. I know RE4 does.\n\nThere was an achievement for letting 9S going around in his underwear too 😆 (barely a crumb of manservice. Still better than nothing, but Wish he were shirltess after the self-destruction. But at least we have shirtless Eve in automata XD)\n\nDoesn’t death stranding have something like this? Where if you look at the dudes crotch long enough he snaps? Or was that a fan thing?\n\nLollipop Chainsaw had an achievement for it too. Juliet would cover herself if you tried. Solid 7/10 game for playing for an evening.\n\nMy girlfriend at the time got the achievement without knowing it existed because she kept trying to sneak a peek. She was genuinely shocked laughing when the game called her out for it.\n\nOkay, I've just read it as \"similar erection\"...\n\nPretty sure this just makes it better for a lot of people\n\nOn an unrelated note, is there a DLC that makes her step on the camera?\n\nEdit: I'm so happy this is now forever ~~one of~~ my most upvoted comments.\n\nEven better, there will be mods!\n\nMods going to make the camera the playable camera and Eve the camera.\n\nmods going to make her blush and strike a pose\n\nMods going to make her hold hands with a superior.\n\nThere's a mod where she sits on the camera.\n\nThere's also pornhub.\n\nNot in Texas. 😢\n\n“Freedom”\n\nThat's disgusting! Got a link so I make sure to never go there?\n\nLink\n\nMight I recommend the Valkyrie fights in the newer God of War games.\n\n\"It adds 4 seconds, but the time for her to take the boot off is worth it\"\n\nTarantino secretly funding as many modders to give him his feets.\n\n&gt; Tarantino \n\n&gt; secretly \n\n:thinking:\n\nOr slowly swallowing the camera, while it keeps recording.\n\nIt appears you typed “step”, instead of “sit”.\n\nPerfect for the recap coming soon\n\nWhy step when you can sit on the camera, right?\n\n&gt; is there a DLC that makes her step on the camera?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\nYeah camera-step is actually in the same patch notes as the 'green fart cloud' huffing fix and the breast physics rework.\n\nIt was in Nier Automata too. 2B does something similar if you try\n\nShe kinda just waves the camera away and turns to ruin the angle. I've actually seen it confuse new players several times, because the camera angle *really* wants you to look up her skirt, so you'll just be minding your own business trying to look at something far away and then she starts moving on her own and you're just like \"wtf was that\"  lol\n\nIt's Kainé in Nier Replicant who kicks the camera. She also will just trigger a game over by killing the player/camera if you persist.\n\nGame over, man! Game over!\n\nYeah if I have one real issue with the design of Nier it's the way that the camera seems aggressively focused on looking up 2B's skirt rather than properly framing the action. Higher angle as the default position would have been a godsend instead of having to fight with it constantly.\n\n\"I like pretty girls\"\n\n- Yoko Taro\n\nHe personally requested numerous times for fans to send him giant Zip(bombs) containing all the online Pornography that was created of 2b's butt. \n\nhe knows his community. my crazy Japanese (good) coomer\n\nYes but he can like pretty girls from a high angle too so I can see what I'm fighting dammit!\n\nHe could, yes.\n\nBut he put a lot of polygons into that butt so I think he knows what he likes.\n\nHow else are you supposed to get the upskirt achievement? /s\n\nI was the confused new player. Had no clue there was even an achievement for looking up her skirt ten times until it popped up for me. Reading the details of what prompted it had me baffled since I hadn't tried to do so *once*, nevermind ten whole time. The game definitely wants you to.\n\nThen there’s me who will intentionally move the camera while 2B is climbing ladders NOT to be looking up her skirt. Androids in video games deserve respect too!\n\nI just blow her skirt up and play with her ass out\n\nman of culture\n\n2Beefed mode\n\nSo brave\n\nAnd it was in the original Nier as well if you try to look up Kaine's skirt\n\nDo it enough times, she kills you lol\n\nLmao Kainé goes fucking hard man.\n\nmakes me want to reinstall the game to try\n\n[deleted]\n\nThose gamers.... Don't exist, friend. I've never played those games but I... I do know that character\n\nZelda's dress in SSBM.\n\n[removed]\n\nVagina dentata maybe?\n\nPillow Pants?\n\nLister Fiend is going to make an appearance too.\n\nOh you know it 😍\n\nlol, 2B did the same thing in *Nier Automata*\n\n2B shoos you away with her hand, and turns around. Eve is a tad bit more aggressive with that kick. XD\n\nYeah it's between 2b in automata and Kaine in nier.\n\nKaine 100%\n\nPacking a surprise in there.\n\nWith an attitude like hers, she better be packing\n\nDoesn't 2B hit you if you KEEP doing it?\n\nyes, the shoo-away was the first animation, try upskirting again few times then it's a kick.\n\nAre you sure? There's an achievement for doing it 10 times, and I did it 10 times all in a row, and she never did it to me.\n\nTurns out it's Kaine that kicks you\n\nI think if you do it too much to Kaine she'll just kill you. Probably in the first Nier.\n\n&gt;and I did it 10 times all in a row\n\nfor the achievement right?\n\nThis is more like Kaine.\n\n2B: I do not care what your original game rules are, you're not doing this :D\n\nKaine in og nier will straight fucking kill you if you keep doing it\n\nno . 2b was kind and just brush you away . this is kaine level angy xD\n\nKaine: what is this weak ass shit\n\nNah man, she kills you for it lmao\n\nShe kills you for it *eventually*.  It takes over a half dozen tries before she finally decides that enough is enough.\n\nObligatory swearing from Kainé as well. XD\n\n\"I only did it for the trophy, I swear!\"\n\n\"What trophy?\"\n\n\"... ... come on, ding. Fucking ding. FUCKING DIIIIIIIIING!\"\n\nIt dinged 10 times ago!\n\nsame in Death Stranding if you keep staring at Norman Reedus crotch he will punch the camera\n\nNah, it's Kaine doing the kick and kill thing.\n\nSam does something similar in Death Stranding, he'll first flip the bird, and then end up punching you if you keep staring at his junk in the safe houses.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auWHGkZHX-U\n\nThere's a great one in Discworld (couldn't find a clip).  \nIf you repeatedly click on Rincewind's crotch he will steal the cursor for a while, and you get some funny VO lines on the warning clicks before that :P\n\nKaine in Nier Replicant too.\n\n2B dodges away from the camera. You're thinking of Kainé in Replicant.\n\nthe developers already saw this coming..\n\nDamn, now that's how you put a reference in your game.\n\nSam in Death Stranding covers his crotch the first 2 times and then punches the camera the third time you zoom in on his crotch in the waiting rooms.\n\nQuiet from MGS V bends over and shakes her ass in your face if you stare at her tits with binoculars while waiting to deploy\n\nKojima lmao\n\n\"when you know why she's basically naked you'll feel bad\" sure bud\n\nThe amount of famous bodyscanned actors this man must have\n\nPraise kojima san\n\nA man of culture.\n\nSpecifically that’s when you have a high relationship value with her, if memory serves\n\nSince by that point she’s crushing pretty hard on the Boss and obviously wants to show interest if he’s staring\n\nThe waiting rooms? Do you mean his own private room with the bed and shower etc?\n\nAnd give them a much better peek when the camera potentially wouldn't have allowed otherwise.\n\nSam from Death Stranding had something similar when he flips you off if you look at his crotch 😆\n\nHe eventually punches you if you keep trying to look\n\nLollypop Chainsaw... maybe the remake, has a whole achievement called \"I Swear! I did it by mistake.\" for looking up her skirt.\n\nThe original had it too…\n\n…So I’m told.\n\nI never played the original but I picked up the remake because an ex of mine thought it was campy fun. It is the most joyless slog of a game I have played in a while. I was an so glad steam let's you return games within a certain time frame.\n\nKojima has done stuff like that generations ago. In MGS1  Meryl will make various comments if you stare at her in first person view and slap you if you do it for too long.\n\nIt was an entire plot point in 3 that EVA kept trying to seduce Snake and he was hilariously oblivious to it.\n\nSnake lives only for the mission, not the booty. Unless the booty is the mission...\n\nNo one ever gives me booty missions...\n\ncall of booty\n\nThere was that achievement in one of the MGS games for staring at a pinup poster in first person mode and calling Otacon called “Snake Beater” lol\n\niirc, she would start blushing if you stared at her face\n\nLove the humor in that game\n\nDo it 10 times in Nier Replicant and Kaine kills you. You even get an achievement.\n\nActual canon ending.\n\nmfers are PARCHED\n\nNot me pausing chicks doing high kicks in fighting games as a 12yo in 1998\n\nDifferent times, my friend. There was no high speed internet with instant access to smut 24/7. You had to dial up and then watch an image slowly load down a page and that was it. That’s your wank image. No surfing around.\n\n\\*cries in german\\*\n\nliving with my mom in rural parts of germany I had luck when we finally moved somewhere slightly less rural and the connection went from non existent to 48kB/s. Spent every other weekend with my dad in the city who had a 50mb/s connection.  until I moved out I mostly pirated SNES games for my PSP. any larger Update on any game would lock me out for a few days. playing CoD with my clan? nope, Update is gonna take a few more nights, unless a weekend at my dad's place luckily aligned with the update, then it was a few minutes of loading and lets a go. Shit is still crazy here. barely fibre outside of larger cities, the farther you go from a city the worse the lines get. And don't get me started on cell phone signal strength. If I wanted to check for new SMS I had to get to a specific point  in the garden depending on what time it was. My first gf almost broke up with me because she couldn't believe 99% of the property is without service most of the day and I didn't want to wander the garden for hours on end for a text convo.\n\nBruh we can take it all the way back to the BBS days, when that shit was in ASCII art. \n\nYes, at some point I jerked off to letters and symbols. Goddamn parched wasn't even the word for the 90s kids.\n\nI'm just going to pretend I'm young and hip and kewl and have no idea what a BBS is....\n\nAnd the let-down when the image was mid. Gotta load up 10 while looking at thumbnails and hope one pays off.\n\nWas watching an image load one time on AOL…\n\nGirls face, cool. She’s topless, nice. No underwear, very cool. Oh god… she’s defecating in someone’s mouth.\n\nMai shiranui had the most ridiculous boob bounce and swing physics in her animations for SNK fighting games. Not to mention them being barely 3 pixels away from spilling out of her clothes at all times. \n\nThey still make nier and stellar blade look prude by comparison tbh.\n\nDead or Alive Beach Volleyball lol\n\nBro are you me with Soul Calibur 2?\n\nLol for real. I've never even thought to do something like this and there's kats out here finding Easter eggs bc they're living on Arrakis levels of bootylessness\n\n“Arrakis levels of bootlylessness” LMAO\n\nThe bonks must flow.\n\nAnyone signaling this hard has almost certainly done it.\n\nYou aren't fooling anyone.\n\nBy \"signalling this hard\" you mean... saying they haven't done it? Or the \"making fun of people who do\" part.\n\nof course, have you seen the alternative 2B from rainbow six?\n\n2 balls?\n\nIts just a funny situation all around.\n\nStellar Blade. Without all the thirst traps is actually a spectacular game. I held off buying it forever because I thought it was just another TnA game that was going to be nothing but all the effort going into visually stunning questionable positioning of the female lead. Which dont get me wrong it is there. But at the cost of story, writing, mechanics, and the world at large. Dont get me wrong I like tits as much as the next dude. But my limited gaming time is for fun on games. Not softcore porn with terrible gameplay loops.\n\nBut the actual game and combat and exploration is actually really damn good. The thing is though the fan service is so over the top it really isnt the players fault at this point. I mean you literally cannot play the game in a way that doesnt end up with eaves entirely outlined pussy in your face. Or a needless boob jiggle. When you get an ambush kill from behind she does this back kick flip that gives you the full spread eagle view. So yeah they are parched. But the game is a dehumidifier in a salt mine in the winter and the only thing to eat is overly salted and dry pretzels.\n\nMan. I’ve played nikke for a while so stellar blade was always interesting, especially just knowing there was going to be a collab in the future. But I wasn’t buying a ps5 to play it and that removed a lot of interest. But I’m pretty sure it’s going to come out on pc at some point now and reading your review, I’m gonna have to play it lol\n\nI think there was an achievement when you did this in Nier automata, nice ref\n\nThere's also an achievement for playing an hour without pants as 9S\n\nYeah. You basically play as 9S, self-destruct and go around for an hour. Tbh, I wish he were shirltess after the self-destruction at least 😆\n\nLol, I got that one without knowing there was an achievement for it.\n\nMad lad\n\nThere also was one in Lollipop Chainsaw, pretty sure it was even called something like \"I did it for the trophy I swear\".\n\nHeh, in the original Deus Ex I was walking around and (of course) went into the women's room. A woman was in there and said she was going to report me and stormed out. I went to my boss to get the mission. After the mission debrief he tacked on \"Oh, and JC, stay out of the women's room.\" The first and maybe only time I ever felt like a game busted me.\n\nWhat a developer who's in touch with their audience actually looks like\n\nShift Up is the gift that keeps on giving.\n\n[deleted]\n\nWhat if you're into women beating you up\n\nThat's actually hilarious. That's the same reaction Kainé has when you do this in Replicant.\n\nThe fact that the developers knew people would do that and added a animation for It is actually pretty funny\n\nWhen is this game launching on pc??\n\nnext year\n\n🤞\n\nI have never seen footage of this game that arent creeping on the protagonist lmao.\n\nThis is the 2nd version of this animation I've seen being shown (different setting) in the last 5 mins. Y'all are too horny.\n\nIts stellar blade. Its a good game dont get me wrong. But half the appeal is seeing a post human 12/10 looking chick in skimpy clothing. Its going to pull a certain group of players.\n\nIt's November\n\nI find the evolution of anti-upskirt animations amusing.\n\nWe've gone from Juliet simply pulling her skirt down, to 2B actively moving away, to Eve just fucking *punting the camera.*\n\nKaine KILLED you in Nier Replicant after kicking it the first times. This is probably just a reference to that. Guessing you can't get killed, though.\n\nEastern developers are so goated\n\nHats off to shift up honestly. I'm very happy they added some of these secret animations from  Nier, including the self destruct outfit.\n\n\\*Having character wear transparent skinsuit giving you a perfect view of her private parts\\*\n\n\\*Still going for upskirts with other outfits....\n\nI mean, what new were you expecting to see there? Eve getting a new vagina?\n\nTaking lessons from Kainé, I see.\n\nAloy gives you a weird look and steps back just out of reach if you try to touch her in the VR game Call of The Mountain.\n\n\"Oh you pervert\" Ashley Graham OG Resident Evil 4\n\nWas it the same with Nier game too? I remember sawing a short for this on youtube\n\nPretty sure 2b does the something similar in Nier?\n\nI came here expecting to be trolled.\n\nBro I love that 😂😂 so many games would’ve made me laugh if they had this ahahhaha"

It’s etched into my brain.\n\nIt also had a mission where you defend pusan against a North Korean invasion\n\n\nHoly fuck that game slapped.\n\nI still have mine!\n\nWe use to rent it for the Sega Mega Drive from a small video shop, was always a fun blast! Same for Toejam &amp; Earl, we rented those games so many times\n\nNot sure if you're aware but there's a \"new\" tj&amp;e game that released in 2019 that is basically just more of the first game. It's very nostalgic and a good time\n\n[ToeJam &amp; Earl Back in the Groove](https://store.steampowered.com/app/516110/ToeJam__Earl_Back_in_the_Groove/)\n\nHO LEE SHIT, THAT'S AWESOME!\n\nTy kind sir.  No idea this existed\n\nDesert Strike was the bomb!! If you had a controller with a rapid fire feature and used it on the nose cannon you were an actual god!! 30mm go brrrrr\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n^^\"Over ^^here!\"\n\nOMFG THATS THE NAME! I was watching this clip like...wait a minute this looks oddly familiar and giving me butterflies. I remember getting so frustrated at that game. Man, what a fucking memory this opened up. I needed that.\n\nI feel sometimes like I was the only person that ever played Urban Strike.\n\nIt was the best. Honestly the Whole series was great fun to play.\n\nBy far the best in the series\n\nMaann nuclear strike on my ps1 memories are flooding back. Id buy this in a heartbeat on my xbox.\n\nThat game was awesome. Full motion video cut scenes lol\n\nMan got eaten by a tiger in that shit\n\nJungle Strike from that crispy blue blockbuster cartridge case struck harder than any of the other strikes. Good times.\n\nTHAT'S HOW IT WAS CALLED !\n\nI've been having flashbacks of this game and not remembering its name !\n\nD-desert strike, my love, is this you...?\n\nWas this the one where you can drop down a ladder to rescue POWs?\n\nYes bro. 👊🏻\n\nomg I haven't thought about this game in *decades*...I feel like a core memory was just unblocked somewhere deep in my brain.\n\nI had the same, some memories came out of the abyss, will totally buy this game.\n\nOmg bro. Im here for it. I'm here with my people.\n\nI use to love flying off while they were still climbing the ladder, made it feel like an action movie!\n\nDesert, nuclear and soviet strike.\n\nThe sound effect from reloading rockets is etched into my brain\n\nYes, and the best pilot is in a downed plane top left of the second map\n\nIt's been 84 years ...\n\nThis looks like Desert Strike's kid who's all grown up, has a wife, steady career, and a beautiful house just aching for a hellfire missile.\n\nBro I fucking LOVED Desert Strike!!  Holy shit I haven't thought about that game in so long.  Ugh it hit at just this perfect time, I remember thinking \"Video games have never felt this good to play before, I can't believe this is real\".  Which is kind of adorable.  I need to find u/cfinger 's game and play it!!\n\nhahah that perfectly sums up how games felt as a kid! I would get so stoked even on the publisher logo screen as the game started up (like wow this game actually works!)\n\nThere was a time that when I saw the EA logo/Yellow tab on cartridges I would be pretty sure the game was of high quality, guess which game started the trend of me checking for that?\n\nDesert fucking strike\n\nRARE in the 90s gave me that feeling. Donkey Kong Country 2 is a classic example of high quality for its time.\n\n[deleted]\n\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/1710820/Cleared_Hot/\n\nThere's the steam page. It's wishlist-able!\n\nAnd to add to the nostalgia, the publisher is MicroProse!\n\no m f g. \n\nBRO THEY EVEN HAVE THE SAME LOGO FROM 30 YEARS AGO.\n\nMicroprose has some awesome games right now, and a lot are doing a great job of bringing back the memories from years ago.\n\nMe too, but probably farther back than your childhood. My first thought was that it reminded me of Choplifter.\n\nI played the hell out of Choplifter on Apple II.  I still play the SMS version from time to time.\n\nFun fact, Desert Strike was inspired by Choplifter 😄\n\nChoplifter the GOAT\n\nI loved playing Choplifter on Commodore as a kid, even though I was terrible at it. That game was hard.\n\nCHOPLIFTER! thank you, couldn't quite remember the name. There was another one where you're a plane dive bombing carriers and boats. Similar era, side scroller. I bet you know it too. But, CHOPLIFTER was great. Picking up the people, trying to get them back... Good times.\n\nThat was my thought too! Choplifter but top down\n\nOh holy shit Choplifter was fantastic! We’re so old…\n\nNo, this is how you imagined that game from your childhood looking.\n\n\nTaking those old concepts and giving them modern interfaces and mechanics and doing it RIGHT will give us some absolutely addictive games.\n\nDesert Strike, gotta stay over the water for that sweet fuel savings! Watch out or R2D2 will blow your shit up! Omg you killed the hostages!\n\nI can tell you must have been a fan of the Stike series (Desert strike and such). :D\n\nHow could you tell? :D\n\nI think a lot of us millenials as well as xennials played those games, the helicopter attacking is one thing but when I saw the helicopter picking up civilians from the ground it was pretty clear where your inspiration came from. What's insane to me is that you got Microprose on board, I haven't heard of that company for decades.\n\nHell yeah i'm glad the rope parts stood out. That was the literally the first thing I programmed into the game, before shooting even. Core memory :D\n\nPut this game on the Switch, I need to buy it.\n\nI'd buy it if it was on Switch it would be perfect for it.\n\nI will definitely be shoveling money your way when you're ready.\n\nLast time I saw your post I mentioned the bloody annoying situation where you need some supplies, you find them with the map, then accidentally destroy the goods because you used 1 extra bullets. This forces the player to be more careful which in turn burns more resources. Will this be an annoyance in your game?\n\nThanks,\nA Strike Series Fan\n\nRight now our ammo pickups are invulnerable :) I'm also pretty sure we won't have fuel as a requirement- i always hated getting farther into a mission and losing because of fuel. \n\nBut I hope to retain the difficulty of the Strike series :D\n\nFantastic on the ammo!\n\nCould fuel still be a thing with a \"consumption rate modifier\"?\n\nSomething where you choose the rate of consumption. From no consumption to double consumption?\n\nWelp, you just manifested a resurgence of some 30 year-old trauma I had forgotten about.\n\nHahaha,\n\nIf you want to relive the pain and have Steam. Look for RetroArch. It's an emulator.\n\nWe Xennials are gonna be all over your game, for sure. I still have my original copy of Desert Strike, in 3 1/2 diskettes.\n\nWill it be PC only? I'd love to play it on PS5\n\nThey came back in 2020 or 2021, and have been developing a few and publishing a bunch of great looking games.\n\n[deleted]\n\nI've just last week seen Microprose on another game that I'm interested in 🤔\n\n[List of Microprose Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_MicroProse_games)\n\nSeems like they're becoming more active again since 2021, I absolutely didn't have them on my screen anymore but I also admit I don't follow new game releases as much as I used to.\n\nThey have published all my favorite games for the past few years. Really good publisher.\n\nShoutout to you dude because the moment I started the trailer, I immediately thought \"why tf hasn't this happened sooner?!\" \n\nDefinitely getting a sale out of me.\n\nIt's awesome. Just the clip, it clearly captures the personality of \"Desert Strike: Return to the Gulf\" on Sega. I'll buy it when it's available. Congrats dude.\n\nOh my gosh WHAT IS THIS!\n\nDesert/Jungle strike on sega were my JAM growing up, what systems? PC only or are you going for console or mobile?\n\nNuclear Strike was the one I grew up with, played it on ps1\n\nNuclear strike is one of my favorite games ever, absolutely needs a remake\n\n&gt; absolutely needs a remake\n\ntbf this post seems about almost exactly that, so you're in luck.\n\nUnless you're looking for modern graphics. I know Ace Combat is about planes, but Ace Combat 7 is a ton of fun. I cant think of any modern helicopter games off the top of my head, but I'm sure someone else can.\n\nMy first was jungle strike. God damn good memories\n\nMine was desert strike, on the Amiga. Good times, and I will very likely pick this up lol.\n\nDesert Strike II : Return to the Gulf.\n\nOne of the best games I played on my Amiga. It taught me some of my first english, and the mixed mission-based gameplay was so ahead of it’s time. I remember it so clearly here 30 years later.\n\nGotta support this dev.\n\nSoviet strike is the first one I played on ps1 and the first game i've tried to use a game shark just to see what things I can do with it...\n\nHell yeah this is so cool!\n\nOh man Desert Strike was quite an experience.\n\nWaited ~~years~~ decades for something like Nuclear Strike!\n\nMe too :D\n\nAlso kind of reminds me of Return Fire on 3DO\n\n3DO??!? RICH KID SPOTTED!  Can I borrow $50? I'm totally good for it. :p\n\n[deleted]\n\nNUCLEAR STRIKE HOLY SHIT MEMORY UNLOCKED\n\nThank you r/gaming! I posted here with a prototype 3 years ago, and that got the attention of the Microprose CEO, who reached out to me on twitter/X. We stayed in touch and then [you guys blew up our new trailer](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1dabzqo/i_got_tired_of_waiting_for_a_desert_strike_remake/) and that got it moving forward.\n\nThis is so crazy to me because I played Microprose games growing up. My mom bought me Falcon 4.0 when I was 11 or 12 and I read that if you learned the game you could fly a real F-16. That was so motivating to a kid who normally can't access \"the real world\" yet. To see the Microprose logo on my own game feels a bit unreal.\n\nBut yeah seriously, thank you. \n\noh and Steam Link if you'd like to wishlist the game: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/1710820/Cleared\\_Hot/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1710820/Cleared_Hot/)\n\nMemories of those Microprose flight sim manuals being an inch thick, with dogfighting instructions inside too.\n\nYEP. I read that falcon 4.0 manual and loved every minute of it\n\nI still have my boxed F19 Stealth fighter!\n\nI have my Red Storm Rising manual from the 80s still, heavily annotated of course\n\nStill have mine, and I don't plan to ever throw it away\n\nI still have mine around here somewhere!\n\nThere's a mod team doing amazing work with the Falcon 4.0 engine at the moment: https://www.falcon-bms.com/\n\nA lot of my friends love falcon bms\n\nMicroprose is still around?!?!\n\nWell...  *back* around... in a different (but similar) form?  [Their history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroProse#History) is quite the ride.\n\ni still remember what an immelmann turn is\n\nPlease tell me this will be Steam Deck verified. I'd love to sit on the couch and get some old school Strike gaming in.\n\nCongratulations by the way. What a cool story and it's awesome when things like this happen. What a small world we live in.\n\nIt will be! Love playing it on my deck. \n\nand thanks. yeah it is kinda crazy. i tried to make games when i was young and it was impossibly hard. so cool to get another shot at it\n\nOh shit so that means I can play it on my Linux machine? You might have just made another sale\n\nI had an f-14 microprose sim and a thrustmaster joystick. I was Top Gun incarnate. Miss it so much!\n\nYour game looks awesome, can’t wait to play it!\n\nAny plans to release it on other platforms? Mobile? Playstation?\n\nThe plan is Steam first and hope to do consoles after. But the console request comments help- I will be mentioning these to Microprose ;)\n\nI would love this on my Switch.\n\nHoly shit yes!\n\nThis kind of game is perfect for portable. I can't see that well and avoid playing things like Monster Hunter and \"complicated looking\" games in portable mode. This looks like it would work great, though.\n\nSteam deck all the way. Publisher already plays it on his deck\n\nPS5 PLEASE!!\n\nI told someone on twitter to tell their local Sony executive and he tagged their CEO 🤣\n\nXbox please\n\nXBOX PLEASE!!\n\nAye microprose, I wanna buy this on BOTH OF MY CONSOLES!!!\n\nThis would be soooo good on mobile! I'm still buying it on steam though. \n\nMan, I grew up with Microprose games too. It's such an accomplishment for you to be in such excellent company, and it speaks greatly of your game.\n\n# XBOX\n\nWishlisted!\n\nAdd localisations files please in future)\n\nWill do! Which language were you looking for? Just to help understand. I translated the Steam page to a few languages but need to add more.\n\nRussian. Ukranian too (both sides no burning)\n\nWill do, actually have those in progress right now!\n\nPlease for the love of all that is holy, make sure it works on the Steam Deck. This is like my dream game for the Steam deck.\n\nIt already works on the Deck! But yeah it's definitely a target platform for us, so you can rest easy.\n\nWait, Microprose is still a thing?\n\nYes! I have been following them for a while and they are really into these kind of classic action games, Carrier Command 2 is fantastic and is also published by them\n\nUgh, me and my friend wanted to like that game. Tried Vr and not but it just feels so damn clunky\n\nThey are back in a big way and about to drop one of my most anticipated games in so long next month.\n\n[Sea Power](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1286220/Sea_Power__Naval_Combat_in_the_Missile_Age/)\n\n\"Remember Microprose?  They're back, in pog form!\"\n\nYes, but its a brand that's been bought and sold a few times.  Though it looks like the current owner is at least aware of the legacy of the brand as mostly military/tactical based games and doing right by the name by still making games under it that fit with it.\n\nI just like the fact that Microprose is an INDEPENDENT publisher again.  It was independent from 1982-1993 when Spectrum/Holobyte bought them out, and it's been passed around ever since. I don't know why I care, other than the fact it seems more legit that it's an actual company rather than a brand name for a parent company.\n\nThe name resurfaced about 4 years ago, taking most of their old library to steam. Since then they have published a fair few new games. And some of their upcoming titles actually look good too\n\nI ain't gon' lie, seeing that Microprose logo getting lifted up again be **hittin**\n\n:D we spent a lot of time getting that scene to look good, so thank you\n\nMan, I haven't thought about Microprose since I last played the OG XCOM games. I got really excited when I saw their logo!\n\nI've had this on my Steam wishlist for years. I can't wait!\n\nThanks so much!\n\nJust curious, but what does it mean to have a publisher for a game?\n\nI thought Steam essentially filled that role.\n\nThey say this in another post:\n\n&gt;Because they are publishing the game! They are funding the rest of development and providing support with marketing, PR, some art and dev, etc.\n\nThis is correct- they basically help you make the game these days.\n\nBro, I spent so much time as a kid playing Desert Strike. I loved that game so much. I never owned Jungle and Urban Strike, but played the hell outta them when my parents rented them for me. I'm in.\n\nRight? Once I saw I could rescue people in Desert Strike I was hooked. It was also the first kind of \"open world\" game from back then.\n\nI distinctly remember the sound the crane made on my Amiga 500. I loved Desert Strike. Can not wait for your game.\n\nHahah yeah. And the low fuel warning. Thank you!\n\nHonest question. Why not just self publish it?\n\nIt's a good question. I was funding the game from savings and that gets scary as the team grows. \n\nLonger answer, the game is doing well enough that I think it needed a bigger team and marketing budget than I could provide on my own. Microprose just fits everything so well that it feels like a 1+1 = 3 situation\n\n[deleted]\n\n:D I'll stick to vector math\n\nWishlisting cos this reminds me of the Army Men: Air Attack series from my childhood!\n\nThis is what I thought of as well.\n\nYES holy shit I was thinking it reminded me of an Army Men game I played as a kid but couldn't remember the name. I will never forget the way the announcer used to say Hooligans name.\n\nBrings back memories. I think Air Attack 2 was the first video game I've ever played.\n\nI spent HOURS replaying that trail level in air attack 2! \n\n\"Real combat, plastic men.\"\n\nMan thats awesome, 4 years of grinding finally paying off. Respect for not giving up\n\nThanks. It has taken a lot more work than I expected, but it has been a fun ride\n\nEveryone is mentioning different games; I'm very much reminded of the helicopter in Return Fire (:\n\nYeah Return Fire is a gem\n\nEnough of a gem for you to also remake? Please? \n\nI would name my first born after OP if this happened...\n\nAgree this made me immediately think of return fire death matches between me and my cousin.\n\nOne of the best multi-player experiences ever IMO. I remember there being a map with two bridges connecting two islands and my brother and I would lace them with mines and just go full meat grinder. \n\nNow I just want to play Return Fire. Wonder if it stands up?\n\nTiger Heli\n\nha!  was seeing all the Choplifter comments trying to remember the name of this one.  \n\nAfter just watching some NES footage, I'm amazed it held my attention for so many sessions.\n\nReminds me of Choplifter. I'm very old.\n\nYou have no idea how happy I am that this was the first comment I saw.  It’s exactly what I popped in to say.\n\nOMG I’m old enough to have played- and totally forgotten that I’ve played choplifter.\n\nMY MAN.\n\nChoplifter was the best.\n\nDESERT STRIKE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nDevelopers: \"no one wants any more strike games, they're not mainstream enough\"\n\n\nGaming Community: \"we really do want them, though\"\n\n\nDevelopers: \"No. You don't\"\n\n\nu/cfinger : \"fuck it, I'll do it myself\"\n\n\nEta: will this come to Switch at all? This would be great for a portable device. I don't own a Deck ha.\n\nThis is an accurate history of events. \n\nI am hoping to come to consoles but can't promise anything yet. (nintendo make a switch 2 soon plz plz)\n\nDesert Strike\n\nJungle Strike\n\nUrban Strike\n\nKudos for you choosing to *Strike* out into the *Desert* of isometric helicopter games.\n\ncan you write our next press release :D\n\nOh wow, I wishlisted this game a year or so ago and just recently removed it thinking it was an abandoned project, really happy to have seen this news!\n\nWelcome back! :D We're working hard on it, you can also check out our devlogs on Steam, we post about once a month or so\n\nThis looks really cool, kinda reminds me of an old MS-DOS game called Seek and Destroy.\n\nReminds me of Raid on Bungling Bay.\n\nOh thank goodness I'm not the only person who remembered this game. I felt so old.\n\nYeah Baby!! gogogoogogo\n\nBy Nostalgia, do you mean like Nuclear Strike?\n\nYes :) Desert Strike was the first one for me, but loved all of them\n\nchoplifter is that you....\n\nCongratulations OP! I remember a post recently where you shared this and we got all nostalgic about the “Strike” games! Woo hoo!\n\nReminds me of Swiv 3d. Had that on an old computer and loved it. \n\nAny idea on price and release date?\n\nStoked to see this project making it this far.  I played so many MicroProse games growing up, I legitimately yelled out \"WHAT!??\" in my office here when their logo came up.\n\nAnd Im a huge fan of the Strike series.  I logged a stupid amount of hours in Jungle Strike on the Genesis as a kid.  I have such a soft spot of isometric games because of it. \n\nCongrats man! Happy for you and excited to get to play!\n\nhahah that's awesome. i know, that logo is attached to some core childhood memories\n\nThis reminds me of Desert Strike! I use to play the heck out of this on Sega Genesis and Sega Nomad!!!!\n\nWaiting on steam (shut up and take my money)\n\nRoger that. [https://store.steampowered.com/app/1710820/Cleared\\_Hot/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1710820/Cleared_Hot/)\n\nIs it deck compatible?\n\nIt will be.... by god it will be!\n\nWaiting for this. Will it be Steam Deck friendly?\n\nThis game reminds me a lot about Chopper Attack on Nintendo 64. Aah, memories.\n\nWill definitely check out Cleared Hot!\n\nThis is just a promotion right like all these posts? Why would you not just self publish? What do they offer you STEAM doesnt?\n\nAlso pretty sure the picture on the steam page is AI generated :/\n\nThis reminds me of Return Fire from back in the 90s. Looks awesome! 😁\n\nPerfect game for the Steam Deck! I love the Strike series.\n\nOMG this is awesome. Besides the Strike games it's giving MechWarrior 2."

Are they for real? They have to announce D4 after that, right?” And then it just ended.\n\nThe poor people who actually paid a ton of money to experience that live in person…\n\nThey were even saying months before \"be excited for Diablo!\" \n\nThen I think they realized a few days beforehand and started saying not to get too hyped up because everyone was clearly expecting Diablo 4.\n\nImagine how little self-awareness you need to have for something like that.\n\nThat's what happens when bean counters run gaming companies. \n\nThey looked at the gaming market and saw how much mobile gaming was worth and thought \"I have the brilliantest idea for the next Diablo game!\".\n\n[deleted]\n\nThey could have done that... But then I would have never bought Diablo 4.\n\nYou shouldn't've anyway\n\nThe internet was saying that based on leaks and rumors. Blizzard ended up releasing a statement trying to stem the rumors but I cant recall if they explicitly said no d4 but I cant recall\n\nBlizzard did release something (or one of their people in interview said something) that basically said there was no D4 but not everyone saw it before the presentation, and those who did basically just shifted over to \"This'll be an announcement for the D3 expansion with the druid!\"\n\nI know people that have refused to even play older Diablo games anymore, the insult cut *that* deep.\n\nI would kind of like D2 remastered, but I just don't want to give Blizzard any money ever again so here we are.\n\nCheck project diablo 2.\n\nThere's a Grim Dawn Diablo mod that's pretty good.\n\nAnd then, to rub salt in the wounds, we got D4.\n\n'do you guys not have credit cards for cosmetics?'\n\nWhats wrong with d4? I just got it\n\nIt's a shitty MMO-lite that says it's an ARPG (debatable).  It seems fairly obvious a significant portion of the team never played an ARPG in their life, and probably came from the WoW team and got like a 3 hour presentation on what an ARPG is (which they presumably fell asleep like 20 minutes into).  Forget what the industry is doing at large, they failed to have features even the immediate predecessor game in their own series, D3, had, and instead had a bunch of pseudo-MMO features like an open shared world with random other plays (no opt out), set world map (no procedural generation), public quests, world bosses, rep grinds, mounts, and the upcoming expansion is literally adding fucking raids (they don't call them raids, but it is group-based content you literally are not allowed to do solo).  \n\nSome people will tell you the game has \"improved\" over the last couple patches.  What this means is that they kind of half-added some ideas from their own predecessor game, D3, and another indie ARPG, Last Epoch, recently.  For people who are deadset on liking D4 due to sunk cost fallacy and/or a core part of their identity being a \"Diablo fan\", maybe this helped, but to me and many others it's clear it's just a substandard ARPG that's still trying way too hard to be an MMO.\n\nive been enjoying it. i tried last epoch and poe and didnt like either of those as much as diablo 4\n\nI appreciated D4 for telling a cool fun story while my character progressed in a very linear fashion so it was tough but doable and sometimes you just gotta cheese an enemy by hiding behind a pillar.\n\nI solo’d the final boss and only died once maybe twice I can’t remember. \n\nI didn’t spend all this time theory crafting and I didn’t run it back with another character. But for the price it was a fun little experience. \n\nI played the shit out of Path Of Exile and burnt myself out. But also they’ve evolved that game so much from Beta I don’t even know if I could play it.\n\nI don't think it was a fair price, personally. They charged 70$ for what amounted to a single player/co-op RPG with shallow customization for many. Couple that with a with a dreadful end game loop, some devastating bugs at launch (half of my druid's unique drops were for the wrong class for a month), some bonkers anti-QoL decisions (WHY CAN'T WE SAVE PARAGON PRESETS?!), and aggressive/annoying monetization, and you wind up with a game that felt insulting given Blizzard's track record with the IP.\n\nWhat's worse, is their scheme for expansions costing *even more money*. As if microtransactions and a 70 dollar box cost weren't enough, they're asking for another 40 on top of that for the newest stuff.\n\nNo, D4 is certainly not worth it when compared to games like Path of Exile or Last Epoch.\n\nIt would have been an all time epic troll to go through all that, and then at the end of the conference go \"Oh yeah, Diablo 4 comes out in February.\"\n\nThen immediately walk off stage.\n\nAnd it made blizzard more than half a billion dollars. Their only mistake was announcing it in blizzcon, but the predatory microtransations mobile game was very much what their play base “wanted”.\n\nAren't most DI players in China? So they should announce it there. /half s\n\n[Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diablo_Immortal)\n\n&gt;\"50% of players have never played a Diablo game before\"\n\nOh yeah, loyal Diablo fans. /s\n\n&gt;\"the vast majority of players aren't spending money\"\n\nYeah because we're aiming for whales.\n\nBlizzard died long before that debacle.  The day they sold to Activision was the day that company died.  Everything created after that had been nothing but corporate cash grabs.  They lost their passion.\n\nDude, I remember when there were people who were happy that Activision would \"save\" Blizzard from Vivendi, because Activision knows gamers and Vivendi was just some media company!\n\nYeah, that didn't work out\n\nWarcraft III was their last great game for me.\n\nThey poured their souls into early WoW, which is why it altered the gaming landscape more than any game in history.  That was the turning point where gamers started to be cool and mainstream.\n\nWow South Park episode\n\nPeak cross over, nothing will ever compare\n\nI still have my WoW friends and family alpha test CD. A buddy was one of their 3D art people.\n\nI may be one of the few who missed having multiple campaigns that spanned many missions: WC3 made me interested in the lore and the related characters.\n\nSC2 and a lot of modern games simply go by too fast to have meaningful encounters and story development.\n\nAnd in more recent news, \"84% of D4 players are choosing to play solo, so we decided to add raiding content to change that.\"\n\nThat shit making them millions and fools are still playing\n\nand yet th3 game was. very popular on phones they had whales paying big bucks plus the computer version as well\n\nIt was the first Blizzcon my partner and I skipped watching, because with all the horrible things starting to come out about Blizzard we just couldn't anymore.  Despite both being long time Blizzard fans.\n\nI cannot imagine what it would have been like if I'd paid for the streaming ticket, much less actually flown out there and spent a few grand on a trip to hear about Diablo Immortal.  Like okay.  You want to cash in on the mobile market.  Start it off with a tiny little teaser for Diablo IV (not that it turned out to be great anyway) and then \"and in the meantime, we're putting out a Diablo game for mobile to tide you over!\"\n\nBut no.  They got weirdly confrontational with the audience.\n\nThe fact that the game has high ratings on my app store was the final nail in the coffin for me concerning whether player review ratings are in any way legit.  Lot of excellent games have like 3.1 stars, meanwhile Diablo Immortal was at like 4.7 last time I looked.\n\nHearing how sad and pathetic drop rates are unless you're a whale was mind blowing.  Like the Dungeon Keeper mobile remake levels of insane greed.\n\nMeanwhile Diablo Immortal is currently the most profitable Diablo installment\n\nDid you talk to anyone cosplaying as D3 characters about it?\n\nI mean live as in livestream.  \nI wouldn't spend my money on some corpo show.\n\nWait this isn't a joke? \n\n🤦🏼‍♂️\n\nDo you guys not have 100 grand to max out your stats?\n\nYeah I’m not kidding it actually takes that much and when someone did spend all that the game refused to give him any more pvp matches because of how absurd of a power gap it made compared to everyone else\n\nA lawyer needs to take a look at the terms and conditions that person agreed to. Cause otherwise the lawsuit is coming.\n\nThat was 2 years ago and they quickly got him back into matches\n\nmy wife and i were there. and everyone wasn't in shock, just a feeling of \"hurry up and get past this fluff to OUR stuff\". \n\nmultiple people around us were starting to console themselves, \"you know how blizzard is, they save the best for last, it's coming up\".\n\nbut it never came.\n\nafter it ended, people looked around at eachother looking for answers, but we had none. the smoking area, normally fairly full, developed a half an hour queue. every former smoker had caved. begging for cigarettes from anyone they could.\n\nthe blizzcon smoking area was a funeral, people began calling it \"the day deckard died\".\n\nThe ridiculous thing is that Diablo: Immortal would have been more well received if they had god damn announced Diablo 4 first.\n\nEven if it was just a short CGI cinematic of just the logo with a  \"And we're proud to announce ... Diablo 4 is in the works!!! I know some of you may be disappointed, but we don't have anything to show you yet. It still needs more time, however! I do have something to tide fans over until we're ready\" message and *THEN* announce Immortal.\n\nImmortal would not have been demonized as much as it was.\n\n&gt;\"the day deckard died\"\n\nstay a while and listen :(\n\nCan I ask the context for this? I'm a bit out of the loop.\n\nBlizzcon 2018 they announced Diablo Immortal as a mobile game for iPhone and Android, and during the q&amp;a session someone asked if it will be available on PC. Blizzard representatives said \"no\" which caused the fans to get upset and the crowd started boo'ing them. Flustered, one of the representatives lashed out and said \"dO yOu GuYs NoT hAvE pHoNeS?\" showing how our of touch Blizzard was/is and it quickly became a meme\n\nhttps://youtu.be/73yT9UXJLT0?t=10s\n\nIs this an out of season April Fools Joke?\n\nHow f'ing sad is it that this was a better plot twist than any of blizzard's writers could write?\n\nThey almost did what Bethesda did when they announced Elder Scrolls Blades and showed a trailer for Elder Scrolls  VI. Even though they barely started developing it. But, last minute they decided against it, even though D4 was well on development by then, which was publiclying known due to job postings. That would have assuaged the fans.\n\nFun fact: Riot mocked this when they announced mobile TFT. Players asked for a mobile version for years and in the announcement they said somethin like\n\n'We realized you guys actually DO have phones'\n\nBro as a Diablo fan that was so brutal. It wasn't just that it was supposed to be just for phones (which that changed anyways) but it was a shitty fucking mobile game 😰\n\nI went to youtube just know to see that presentation again. Guess what ad played...\n\nHalf life 3 MOBILE  \nThat would radicalize me xD\n\n[removed]\n\nImagine having a gaming platform service that's worth $10 billion dollars. \n\nAnd then deciding you need *more* money through microtransactions and not releasing the game everyone has been asking for, for decades now.\n\nDon’t you have phones?\n\nTBH if there was ever a group I'd believe could make a mobile exclusive and have it turn out really good, it'd be valve. Their whole thing is trying new things.\n\nThey are awesome indeed, their take on VR was stunning, but mobile is very....restrictive!? Its like \"paint me a picture\" but you only give them water and sand :p\n\nThe weapons sold as gatcha\n\nat least 100x pull for Crossbow MK. II, which costs $70 in total.\n\n70 bucks for 100 pulls ain't too bad (sadly)\n\nCrossbow MK. 2 is only an Epic item though, the X Crossbow is a legendary item that takes an average of 300 pulls to obtain\n\nAh true true\n\nSorry is this real life human $70 for a in game weapon?\n\nI have no idea but I know some games do that. Spend so many dollars in pulls and hope you get the weapon/character early\n\nPulls as in like a slot machine? People bitch when new games are $70 and others are saying $70 to play a slot machine isn’t bad?? That’s fucking nuts\n\nThe people that says $70 for a game is bad and the people who spent twice that amount each month on Genshin Impact are usually different types of people\n\nIt's called gatcha, which is like a Japanese version of those toy dispensers that you'd put a quarter in and get a little ball with a toy inside. The full name is gachapon or something.\n \nThink loot crates, but instead of cosmetics you're getting different characters and weapons which are usually orders of magnatude more powerful than the stuff you gain in the normal course of gameplay.\n \nIt is very common for 100 \"loot crates\" to cost $70-80 us and 100 of those is often the average number needed to get 1 character or weapon of the best quality.\n \nYou do get some amount of free \"crates\" in these games and some are more abusive than others. genshin impact is one that is relatively generous and if you do a lot of research ahead of time (something no new player is going to know) it's possible to do very well in it without spending money, but the amount of knowledge you need and strategy around using your free \"crates\" to actually do that is impossible for the inexperienced person and so you're heavily incentivized to spend something.\n \nThe worst offenders will have people spending hundreds or thousands a month to \"keep up\" as power creep from new characters makes older characters completely pointless.\n\nDon't say it's gatcha, use the proper Valve name: Weapon Case.\n\nWe call ‘em “crates” round here, pardner\n\nHalf Life Alyx 2\n\nValve counting to 3 at this point might actually be a more celebrated event than HL3.\n\nTo be fair, Alyx was a brilliant game and I would not mind getting more of the same.\n\nMy running theory is Alyx will be the protagonist of all HL VR games going forward with Gordon being the protagonist of HL3 and any future traditional FPS titles.\n\nMy man here talking about *multiple* future HL games! Can I borrow your optimism?\n\nI think it's likely over the next 1 to 10 thousand years\n\nI want a very deep huff from that copium you are breathing.\n\n[deleted]\n\n[Well... I mean... you're not wrong.](https://hlyotd.com/)\n\nThe cliffhanger ending convinced me that there would be more but here we are.\n\nDeadlock 2 before half life 3\n\nHalf Life: Kleiner\n\nyes   if we get hl 3  that opens the gates for all the other games to get a 3  :D\n\nMonkey paw wish.\n\nmom can i have 60 dollars for the new bikini gordon skin pls mommy 🥺\n\nGet a job. You’re 35!\n\nSigh, back to rule 34 I go…\n\nI see it's that time of the decade again.\n\nI was going to ask if people are seriously still waiting on this game…?\n\nI'm still waiting on the last book of [this trilogy.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Books_of_the_Art)\n\n🤡\n\nI'm still waiting for the third book of Stephen King and the late Peter Straub's Talisman trilogy.\n\nHalf Life: Alyx does everything short out outright confirming that Half Life 3 is coming. \n\n\n&gt;!You literally spend the last few seconds of the game playing as Gordon right after the events of HL2: Episode 2 and then you're handed a crowbar.!&lt; There's no room for interpretation there, that was Valve saying that they are in fact planning to continue the Half Life story.\n\nIt's more fun to joke about. It's been years since someone put the script for 3 out their so the cliff hanger isn't as much of an annoyance now.\n\nIt's not a script, just an idea that would have been heavily modified if the game was actually made. Not to mention the ending of Alyx completely overwrote it. \n\nAlso epistle 3 SUCKS.\n\nIt breaks with the character of basically every important character, it answers nothing, and it leaves it all on some stupid time loop ending.\n\nA nihilistic time loop ending, too.\n\nFrankly I think downer endings usually suck, but it extra sucks for something like Half-Life, which is basically ‘indomitable human spirit the game’.\n\nBrother people are still holding negative 4-5-6-7 figure bags for gme and amc.\n\nYou're spot on, [the joke was made 9 years ago](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISlRVaQuaYY)\n\nTeam Fortress 3.\n\n\"Drops club in angry crowd and walks away...\"\n\nOrange Box 2\n\nWas something announced? Sorry I'm out of the loop\n\nspoilers for half life alyx &gt;!alyx has an end credits scene that's right after the events of episode 2, where you play as Gordon Freeman and Eli hands you a crowbar which heavily insinuates half life 3 is coming or at the very least another half life game!&lt;\n\nAlso there have been a few recent leaks suggesting a half life game has been in the works for the last 5 years or so\n\nThere was a leak, look at Gaben Follower on yt.\n\nBut no name was actually mentioned, just \"hlx\" witch is belive to be the next hl game\n\nOnly if Gabe knew how to count to 3\n\nHonestly if I had to pick, I think I’d rather have portal 3\n\nAt this point I will take anything that contains \"3\" from Valve.\n\nOrange Box: Rerelease, 3 pack\n\nArtifact 3\n\nSo the number after two and before four\n\n[Gaben counts to three](https://youtu.be/tT3v5dd0SFU?si=wzhLT8m8Zn4vhXuL)\n\n[removed]\n\nHalf Life 3 x Fortnite\n\nOuya exclusive.\n\nCurious question; do people still think HL3 will ever release? Cause Valve clearly ain't ever gonna release a game with 3 in the title\n\nYes, I'm sure my grand children will buy this game for their kids.\n\nGaben explained that they'll only make it when they believe they can make it properly innovative once again. \n\n\nAlyx was certainly innovative and a great use of vr tech, but it remains too much of a niche. Soooo... something else?\n\nThere's nothing they can do with a PC FPS anymore, so the only way they can be properly innovative is in the VR space. Which either means another niche title again, or they wait until VR gaming is close to taking off, then pop Half Life 3, and that could be the catalyst that does it.\n\nI'd rather be dead\n\nAnd I'm still here waiting for Half Life 2 episode 3 😭\n\nJust make it a live service looter shooter. That would be even worse.\n\nYou guys do not have VR Headsets? Oh wait, that did happen.\n\nHalf Life Alyx was legit good ass game though\n\nProbably the only game I've seen besides Boneworks to really push the capabilities of VR actually. I can't decide which I like more. That game was like a giant tech demo and I loved every second of it.\n\nI would not be mad if Half Life 3 was VR only.\n\nno one is saying it wasn't great. I really enjoyed watching a play through.\n\n  \nBut just imagine how much i would have enjoyed actually playing it...\n\nToo bad I get sick wearing VR headsets. I'll never know how good a good VR game is.\n\nFuck whoever downvoted this. I mean, out of all the other comments in this thread, why would someone get pissed at this particular one? Sorry if this gives you an annoying reddit notification, I just had to say that.\n\nIt's too bad that for many of us, VR is just impractical and/or unaffordable.\n\n[deleted]\n\nHL3 not being a VR game is the saddest thing ever for sure. I'll just wait for the inevitable VR mod, but obviously that won't use the medium to its actual potential.\n\nThis is why half-life: alyx was named alyx.\n\nIt would just be World War 2, Episode 1\n\nWhat kind of sick fucking bastard even thinks of this?\n\n[deleted]\n\nYeah, Dota Underlords was quite fun on mobile.\n\nDon’t you guys have phones?\n\nNot quite, it needs a battle royale, battle pass, premium battle pass, and supply drops\n\nSteam Deck exclusive 😈\n\n\"only for apple arcade\"\n\nBasically how Blizzard died the moment they announced Diablo Immortal.\n\n“Do you guys not have phones?”\n\nAw shit. Here we go again.\n\nThe announcement of Diablo Immortal should have been the downfall of Activision (blizzard no longer exists). But we still believed Diablo 4 would be good. Last time.\n\n\"Do you guys not have phones?\"\n\nI think it'll be fine. \n\nThere's literally nothing they could do that would make 3 worth the hype and fuss now and with the original writer gone and the way writers are today I have 0 faith in the story even being a tiny bit good anymore. It's best to just let it be a dead franchise.\n\nWe got Alyx as a spin off and that was fun, time to let it rest in peace.\n\n[deleted]\n\nCounter argument: Fallout 3.\n\nI've seen game devs successfully resurrect dormant franchises before with new teams and different writers.\n\n/r/gaming thinking Half Life is a major IP still\n\nMake sure release in germany\n\nIf the first two panels were real, it feels more likely the 3rd panel would be the two people looking at the announcement on their phones or projected to a TV, rather than on a desktop with a keyboard and mouse.\n\nIt's shame that people completely forgot why exactly HL gained popularity (and why HL2 was heavily criticized by fans) and just monkeying around about it branding...\n\n[Do you guys not have phones?](https://youtu.be/ly10r6m_-n8?si=KBAZncy2fWxlo6cN)\n\n*Half-Life Run*\n\nThis is how I felt when Half-Life Alyx was announced ONLY for VR headsets.\n\nI’ve been waiting so long that even if they did release HL3 I probably wouldn’t want to get my hopes up it was true. I probably wouldn’t even believe it if I was sat playing the game.\n\nPlease be just a joke"

There had been a recent wave of gorgeous fashion models found naked and unconscious at laundromats all over town. Unfortunately, I was assigned to a missing persons case over in Silent Hill. I was across town doing my laundry when I got the call.\"\n\nA problem at the apartment building? What is it?\n\nIt's a large tower that sublets rooms to tenants, but that's not important right now.\n\nBless you for setting up the joke\n\nYou know, standard apartment building stuff.\n\nWe need you to bring a 6 pack of soda so we can knock the key stuck in the garbage shoot down to the bottom which will be one of 5 different keys necessary to open a small container which contains a single strand of hair which we need to use to fish a grandfather clock minute hand out of a drain.\n\nYou know, standard apartment building stuff.\n\n&gt;garbage shoot\n\nr/boneappletea\n\nNow let's say that a girl named Alessa was tortured by the town's cult in order for them to be able to birth their \"god\".\n\n\"a girl named Alessa was tortured by the town's cult in order for them to be able to birth their god.\"\n\nThey say I'm taking a chance going to Silent hill, but you take a chance getting up every morning crossing the street, or sticking your face in a fan\n\nBut why male models?\n\nYes. Well, when I see 5 weirdos dressed in togas stabbing a guy in the middle of the park in full view of 100 people, I shoot the bastards. That's my policy.\n\nI promise you; whatever scum did this, not one man on this force will rest one minute until he’s behind bars. Now, let’s grab a bite to eat.\n\nThat was a Shakespeare-In-The-Park production of \"Julius Caesar\", you moron! You killed 5 actors! Good ones.\n\nI love the “Good ones!” Like maybe it was okay if they were bad\n\n100%, so many layers to the humor.\n\nthat was real peak cinema. nothing ever topped those 3 movies . \n\nhey wait that's enrico pallazzo. PURE GENIUS\n\nNow lookup the 6 episodes of Police Squad that lead to the movie.\n\nare you kidding me ? i am 47. those were the movie i had been watching when they released it. even moscov one\n\nThey're so damn good\n\nA Naked Gun reference? How old are you? How old am I? Please don't answer, I'm gonna take a nap.\n\nI too was an adventure once....\n\nTruth hurts. Maybe not as much as jumping on a bicycle with the seat missing, but it hurts.\n\nNothing to see here.  Please disperse!\n\nNo lie i hear the theme song playing\n\nThanks for not lying.\n\nHe deserved to end up in Silent Hill for that alone.\n\nThat's how you know he's a piece of shit\n\nSilent Hill was right to choose him.\n\nJust fucking staring at us right from the start\n\nThat hair would slick back real nice\n\nPEOPLE CAN CHANGE! I USED TO BE A PIECE OF SHIT!\n\n*He can’t keep getting away with it.*\n\nWhat, is some passive aggressive fog monster gonna leave a note on his windshield? You’re good James\n\nThat's why he get got by the fog curse obviously.\n\nHe was distracted by Mary starting to rot a bit and attract flies in the backseat. \n\nAt least he left the door open, it’ll make things less awful for Laura/Maria.\n\nNot like there's a great deal of traffic to be competing for parking spaces right now.  \n  \n  As the age old adage says: *\"If a car parks like a jackass, but there is no one around to see it, why you crying?\"*\n\nDoes it really matter in an area devoid of humans?\n\nBut he exactly occupies his spot, no? Not a single inch out of his box\n\n[deleted]\n\nThis guy parks\n\nThey meant James himself, he is parked right in the slot. The car is whatever.\n\nYeah,\n\nBut if you park next to him, your car will get dinged.\n\nWhich makes it not want for you to park there,\n\nSo, while he isn't taking up two spots, he is making it impossible for the spot next to him to park safely\n\nWhy is there always somebody defending people parking like an asshole\n\nBecause they want to justify their own shitty parking\n\nDon't forget that on original PS2 the game was played in 640x480. Without any anti-aliasing. And not even at 25fps\n\n[deleted]\n\nYeah for me it was a 17\" CRT tv in the bedroom at the time, fond memories.\n\nI've used reshade on a few 2d games to simulate the CRT effect and while it's not perfect the look and feel is just that much different. It's hard to explain if you haven't sat in front of a CRT before, because it blurs the pixels enough that the picture has a much softer feel and isn't quite so pixel perfect.\n\nI would say it is night and day seing old game on crt tv and lcd monitor. First time i got lcd monitor and downloaded few old sega games i could not believe how bad they looked i thought those games were broken or something. Than turned same game on crt and it was flawless.\n\nYeah, older games, especially from the 8-bit era, genuinely look far worse on modern screens than they did back then and it's not just rose-tinted spectacles, CRT really did give them a different feel. Some C64 and Amiga graphics looked absolutely amazing and I am sure part of it was the way the CRT \"blended\" the colours together. It was analogue anti-aliasing :D\n\n\n&gt;I am sure part of it was the way the CRT \"blended\" the colours together.\n\nIt absolutely was, and the artists took this into account when designing graphics.  This is why pixel art can look stellar on a 30 year old SNES title going through CRT, but on a flat screen it's nothing but a pixelated mess. \n\nThere was a lot of thought put into maximizing the CRT's output.\n\nYeah I remember when I got a PSX when I was like 13 or 14 plugged it into a flat screen and was like wtf ?\n\nIt's natural anti aliasing.\n\nOne of the problems I find with large screens these days is that pixel art games are too large. So the part of your brain that makes those blocks blend together so well (just like your CRT) can't anymore.\n\nThat and there's a few differences in how color and motion are represented on CRT. They definitely combine for a different experience and one a lot of us find to be nostalgic.\n\nPlayed the original Silent Hill 1 on a Zenith CRT that had the volume buttons pressed into the TV so my brother and I had to stick pencils in the button holes to adjust it.\n\nOne of my fondest memories is my brother and I first getting the game, turning off all the lights in the house, and sitting in the bedroom floor playing it. I was probably 8-9 years old.\n\nThe ghost babies freaked us the fuck out.\n\nBet you it looked worse on the flat screens of the time anyway\n\nCRTs basically have built in AA and LCDs of the time sucked balls so yeah\n\n[deleted]\n\nLCDs were ass in terms of response times for decades. When they started becoming mainstream in the mid 2000s they were just a smeary mess even if you got the fastest TN on the market. A lot of people dealt with their 900lb CRTs because the experience was just so much better for everything.\n\nAnd TN had awful contrast, the blacl level was grey.\n\nAnd they look good to this day.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI remember one of the early LCDs, probably from a small brand. Man, it looks AWFUL. Made Age if Empties II look like an oil painting in n3Ed of restoration.\n\nAge if Empties II?\n\nSounds like an interesting bootleg.\n\nyou can tell if someone is a melee player by the number of CRTs they own\n\nOr by how close to the server they have moved to.\n\nThose early TFTs were rough.\n\nI had a flatscreen crt tv with a vga hook-up for my dreamcast and it was so next level for the time.\n\nI really wish we can get a more modern equivalent or successor to CRT's because LCD's and looking at these older games on the LCD's really don't give the charm and magic that these games appeared with. It's so inconvenient having to move CRT's around. &gt;\\_&lt;\n\nSH2 on PS2, from what I remember, runs at a non-standard resolution, something like 520x440, and it would be interlaced not progressive scan.\n\nFor those unaware, interlaced means every other horizontal line on the screen was rendered in a single frame, and then the next frame would render the second set of alternating lines. So effectively, the game was actually rendering at something more like 520x220 natively.\n\n[deleted]\n\nProbably made it even more terrifying.\n\n*static*\n\noh fuck\n\nit had the original anti-aliasing: CRT\n\nOddly enough I feel like whatever fps games were on CRTs look smoother than 60 fps games on regular flatscreens. \n\nI know there’s a scientific reason for this but yeah lol\n\nPixel response time. (Monitor specs usually lie about this number, much like audio amps)\n\nIt looks better at its original resolution with a crt or crt filter than it does played at a higher resolution.\n\nEntrance is on wrong wall of bathroom in remake, literally unplayable\n\nThey removed the bin infront of the car!\n\nBut they added more parking!\n\nsmh at all these car centric developments /s\n\nPro car propaganda needs to end.\n\nR/fuckcars\n\n/r/dragonsfuckingcars\n\nr/carsfuckingdragons\n\n[deleted]\n\nTrans trees, woke propaganda\n\nThis is meant for players to spend more time on this game trying to find a bin, hence spending more money.  or some other conspiracy theory.\n\n[deleted]\n\nLiterally playable?\n\n[deleted]\n\nthere's a trashcan by the bathroom, which also makes more sense.\n\nThe town design in the original is... weird. Like the fast food drive through that leads to nowhere.\n\nI get that they cleaned things up, and its not a big deal at all, but some of the non-sequitur-ness of the level design had some charm to it.\n\nThey fixed the location of the hydrant too. It shouldn’t be butted up against a telephone pole.\n\nWhen I saw stuff like this in video games as a kid, I just always chalked it up to developers not being real architects or whatever, like video games being close enough to reality, doesn't need to be perfect. Also I noticed this a lot in specific games from japanese developers.\n\nLike Raccoon City in RE, it's supposed to be an American city, but everything about it always seemed off. Streets were narrow, rooms had weird configurations, even down to what kind of furniture and its placement in a room just felt odd, and I figured, it's just that way because it's a game.\n\nUntil I went to Japan. Then I realized all these games that were from Japanese developers making games set in America, all they did was just create Japanese places with an American skin... Lol.\n\nMaybe this uncanny effect helps create an uneasy atmosphere in horror games like Silent Hill, where you are in some small American town, but you know that no small American town looks anything like what you are seeing. Or maybe it does look like one but all the details are slightly different.\n\nReddit is a crappy platform and being frankly, which big social network isn't? You should be spending time with your friends and family and delete this thing, I'm finally doing it myself\n\nThe curve is rounded instead of square **IMMERSION RUINED TIME TO EDIT WIKIPEDIA AND MAKE THE SCORES 0/10**\n\nI had my doubts that bloober had the chops to pull it off, despite some technical yips and stutters they proved me wrong\n\nCurrently 10hrs in and yep, game is superb, but the infamous unreal engine 5 technical issues are ever present.\n\nThe stuttering prevents me from playing. I am about 2 hours in and I've already seen enough. Not continuing my playthrough until it’s fixed.\n\nWhat platform are you on? On PS5 performance mode I've just had the occasional small frame drop, it's mostly been pretty smooth\n\nSame\n\nThey’re likely talking about PC. IIRC it’s a pretty stuttery mess.\n\nEdit; I’m glad some of you haven’t had issues. That’s the beauty of PC gaming! There’s lots of variables.\n\nIt's to be expected, consoles are very easy to optimize for because of hardware uniformity, PCs are not, and they have deadlines that they have to meet so they usually just get it running on PC with the expectation that they'll optimize it in the future.\n\nOh 100%. There’s far more variables on a PC, I was just saying that they’re likely on PC.\n\nNot only that, but it originally wasn't planned to release on PC. Bloober had to convince Konami to let them release it on both PC and PS5. This likely put a major delay into PC optimization\n\n[deleted]\n\nTraversal stutter happens when the loading and decompression of data for the area you are traversing happens at too high a load per frame which causes a brief stutter. It is a more difficult problem to solve than it sounds and the Unreal Engine has always struggled with it to some degree.\n\nPS5 has dedicated decompression chips designed to decompress their proprietary file formats instead of having decompression done on the cpu. These dedicated chips are very good at their job and don't strain the cpu while doing so. \n\nThe benefits of a single hardwarw config and that config only being used for games means the hardware can be designed to run games much more efficiently than a PC ever could. The PS5 being a 200 watt machine whose equivilant gpu would need that much or more on pc is a good example. They can also specifically control how to treat data and such in the hardware in a way that is best for games rather than needing to be a modular jack of all trades for general pc use\n\nHow does it look in performance mode? I believe I read the lighting effects take a real hit in that mode.\n\nI've been brute forcing my way through and will do a more hawk-eyed play through once it's patched.\n\nBadly optimized games aren't the fault of UE5 per se (well not solely ... ) \n\ni'm making a game in UE5 myself (well it doesnt really show though [[1](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1538030/Steinstern/)]). But it runs buttery smooth with hundreds of FPS (but without Nanite or Lumen)\n\nBut for game companies it's more lucrative to focus on visual fidelity and catch some (many?) player's eyes and ignore expensive optimization as much as possible.\n\nMy target at one point was to hit 60 fps easily on a Steam Deck, but not photorealism.\n\nThere have been many flops this year and last year of games not performing well on PC with that engine.\n\nSo either the developers are being rushed to not consider optimization or the engine itself was released way too early\n\nI think it's a bit of both and then some. UE5 had a marketing campaign that basically made it sound like it's almost going to \"optimize\" or \"make\" games for you.\n\nNanite and Lumen are the best examples, because they're taking a lot of work off your shoulders in regards to terrain modeling and lighting respectively - the issue is that they're very costly in terms of performance. Most devs seem to simply use upscaling to go around this, despite the fact that they're forcing it on even *at 1080p*, which is a ridiculous thing to even think about.\n\nBasically the engine is \"fine\", as in you have a lot of tools and they're pretty awesome. But they're not magic like Epic wanted us to believe, there's still a *ton* of work you have to put in, otherwise your game *will* run like ass. Look at Remnant 2 - it's not a bad looking game by any means, but it's definitely no AAA, even in comparison to the previous generation of consoles, yet it forces upscaling even at 1080p to run \"properly\".\n\nMost comical studio name takes on intense psychological horror game. \n\nThe only games of theirs I've played were Observer and later Blair Witch. After seeing the improvement between those two I didn't really get the doubters.\n\nI am stunned Bloober Team pulled this off honestly, I fully expected this to flop from the minute it was announced. Glad I was wrong though.\n\nThis is a great example of two things\n\nFirst. How well they did with the graphics of the remake. \n\nBut also secondly. Just how effective those old PS2 graphics are at creating an unsettling grimy atmosphere.\nIt’s like using an old grainy vhs filter in a horror movie\n\nIt’s something the new one can’t quite replicate. By cleaning up the graphics, it loses a tiny bit of creepiness \n\nSomeone posted down below that there’s a 90s graphics filter setting in the remake.\n\nThat I did not know. \n\nI might have to take a look at how effective it is\n\nIt just looks like it just washes it out by the image demo. Haven’t used it personally.\n\nI've switched between having it on and off, and the filter is surprisingly good. It takes away the clean look of the game and makes it have an effect that you aren't in a real place. I wouldn't go so far as saying it makes it scary, or even unsettling, but it gives the impression that you aren't in a real place.\n\nI'm probably explaining it poorly since I got off work lol, but yoh should definitely look into it more.\n\n[removed]\n\nPS2/XBOX-era graphics will always have a place in my heart. They were a big enough jump in realism vs PSX-era to significantly increase immersion, but still (un)detailed enough that your imagination has to fill in a lot, and I think older fantasy and horror games benefit from that.\n\nThe lack of shaders probably help too. There are way too many things being processed over the image these days.\n\nThey also had a sheen/grit to the models and textures that I don't really see nowadays.\n\nThere's a wave new of horror games released with that aesthetic. That graphic style encapsulate a period of time that certainly could be considered the golden of 3D graphics. Just like how hand drawn animation can be down right beutiful and 2D graphics still have a certain charm to them.\n\nYeah, I mean no disrespect to the remake which clearly looks very nice and objectively \"better\", but in some ways I actually prefer the original. It had a stylised, dreamlike (or nightmarelike) quality which is in some ways diminished by the more realistic style. \n\nIt's like the difference between comic art and live action films. The fact that the live action film looks more realistic doesn't necessarily mean it looks *better* than the original comic artwork.\n\nThe remake is atmospheric in its own way, but I will admit that it no longer looks like what you see in a dream, which is part of what makes Silent Hill 2 so cool.\n\nFor me the biggest difference is that it doesn't feel like someone's watching you. With the original (which I never beat) the camera angle gave off the impression that you're always being watched. For me it added to the experience.\n\nWith that said, being an over the shoulder game, they did an amazing job bringing this game to the modern day and making it scary even if it's less-dreamlike.\n\nI disagree. This screenshot doesnt do the rest of the game justice. It is a slightly different feel of creepiness but the game is horrifying. The lighting, sound design, and environmental detail are incredible. Idk how they did it but the fog in the town feels *alive* and everything about the Otherworld is superb\n\n&gt;  By cleaning up the graphics, it loses a tiny bit of creepiness \n\nhuh\n\ni thought it was just me\n\nI’ve been enjoying playing the remake with the 90s graphics filter enabled, it really helps it feel closer to the original.\n\nThe original definitely had a look. Unsettling.\n\nI'm playing the original right now and the atmosphere is so nice for fall. \n\nThe remake looks great. But from this pic alone, it looks like a normal gloomy, rainy day with a nice view. It is  beautiful realism and polished. And because it is also quite dark, you don't see enough to really feel the creep factor.\n\n\nThe original comes across more creepy because it is \"unrefined\" and isn't perfected realism and beauty.\n\n\nThe view is obscured, the trees are few and a bit weirdly shaped. There is no sky, just a fog. The asphalt/pavement looks so rough and worn down that it gives you the feeling the place is abandoned and/or not maintained. The clearly  dirty building with a pitch dark doorway.\n\n\nBut I also think one pic can't tell much. The remake will probably be plenty creepy, just in a more beautiful way.\n\nFrom this vantage point it looks beautiful but rainy but as you go down towards the town the fog starts getting thicker and the nostalgia kicks in. They did a great job with the fog. I was playing last night with all the lights off and was in a store and I could see the first vomit monster guys just wandering in and out of the fog on the streets, unaware of my presence and it was creepy as hell knowing I had to go back out in it\n\nShouting out Silent Hill 2 Enhanced Edition on PC\n\nWhich IMO is better than emulated version.\n\nhttps://enhanced.townofsilenthill.com/SH2/\n\nTechnically better yes but it loses the charm of the PS2 version's grain and \"grit\" I feel given the baseline graphics are still similar (squared circles etc).\n\nI thought it was a pretty good preservation, remastering, with all the film grain grit and what not.\n\nCan you show me an example of what you mean?\n\nEverything is too bright and clean\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/j43vKbE.jpeg\n\nAnd the flashlight is turned into a freaking floodlight\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/xjDkD1g.jpeg\n\nSilent Hill shouldn't be sharper, brighter, and cleaner. That defeats the whole point. If you're going to play the original then do it in all of its dark, grungy glory, or play the remake in its high fidelity immersion. The Enhanced Edition sits in this weird middle-ground.\n\nSame thing for the Horizon Zero Dawn remaster.\n\n[The remaster looks worse for the same reasons.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFzO5JbQO6c)\n\nThe remaster is brighter to the point of too bright, has more saturated colors, and \"pretty'd\" everyone up so they look like they have plastic surgery and too much makeup.\n\nThe original has a nice rustic appearance. The new one looks like amateur modders added in too many filters and shaders with cranked up settings.\n\nThe atmosphere in the Remake looks amazing I honestly thought it couldn't capture that eerie, dark, foggy, creepy vibe of the old titles but they nailed it.\n\nImo they didn't capture it, but not from any fault of their own, I don't think it's possible with modern graphics and sound design.\n\nI was trying to put my finger on it the other day while playing, because while it's certainly scary, it's much less dreadful and oppressive, and I think it comes down to a few things:\n\n1. Dialogue feels more natural and there's more of it, removing part of that eerie, dreamy feeling that these people are wrong somehow\n2. There are more details in the environment, which means things look more like they should\n3. There's more to explore, so you don't feel like you're being guided to a conclusion as much as you do in the original. It's less like the city is leading James down this path, and more like you have free reign of the city and are kinda finding your way on your own.\n4. There's more ambient noises. In the original, you don't really hear things like wind chimes, there's no wind, there's hardly any sounds aside from the sounds James makes and the sounds the monsters make. The town itself feels wrong, it feels dead, like it's not just that it's been abandoned. It's completely dead.\n\nI don't think any of this could really be done differently. Modern design philosophy and better technology kind of make all of this not an option, besides the last thing. But ultimately it adds up to a scarier but less creepy, less unsettling, less dream-like setting.\n\nThe original feels almost like a dream. Every room you go in feels like it has a specific purpose in James's journey, you almost never go anywhere that doesn't. And the people you meet never say a whole lot, it feels like everyone is just out of it, and barely any part of who they were is left inside them. They're just shells of who they used to be.\n\nIn the remake, everyone feels like an actual person and the city loses that dreamy feeling because it still feels like a place people can live in, rather than some fucked up fake version of a real city conjured up by the spiritual energy around silent hill. There are way more places to explore that don't really affect anything or serve a purpose in James's journey, which isn't a problem. Nothing I'm saying is a problem with the game, it's just a different experience.\n\nI just finished the game today (I bought Early Access. I know, I'm terrible), and I strongly disagree with your point about the dialogue. So much so that it kind of amazes me that you feel the way you do about it. \n\n  \nIt took me about half the game to realize that the dialogue was intentionally written the way it is. Before that, I thought it was just very, very badly written. Why? Because absolutely nothing feels natural at all. Nobody talks like a real human being (with a few notable exceptions that make sense) would, and nobody acts like a real human being would in this situation. The dialogue is phenomenal in the remake and it's entirely because it feels so wrong. I am honestly very confused by how you think it feels natural, because to me it's the exact opposite. \n\n  \nI also disagree about the game not feeling like it's guiding you along. again, about halfway through the game I sent my brother a text saying more or less that I found it silly how the main character just follows these random clues that both come out of nowhere and don't actually seem like they align with his goal of finding his wife. Things like \"I found a note on the floor saying to go to this place, I guess I'll just assume it's for me and go to the place!\". Until it kind of clicked with me that the town was guiding him along, I actually thought it was absurd how often James ended up heading in the right direction in spite of the fact that he had absolutely no logical path forward. I think this game does an amazing job of making the player feel like they're being steered along. There's practically no logic in where James heads next. He just follows the directions he's given even when they seem entirely unrelated (like finding notes that have nothing to do with him, which happens very often). \n\n  \nI know opinions are like buttholes and all that, but I find it kind of funny that the complaints you have are the things that I thought were done exceptionally well. I almost have the exact opposite opinion of yours when it comes to the dialogue and the locations, and I thought the dreamy feeling of the world was absolutely spot on. ESPECIALLY the characters. To me, reading your complaints, I feel like the game did all of these things. Not just well, but exceedingly well. \n\n  \nI do agree with you about the sound though. I thought it would have been a bit better if there was less ambient noise. It wasn't super noticeable for me in the town itself, where ambient noise is somewhat expected, but it was very noticeable in the interior locations. Sometimes you'd hear noises from monsters and just immediately recognize that that isn't the sound the enemies in the game make, so it's just background noise. Knowing that every sound is a creature that is just out there somewhere is much creepier. \n\n  \nI played the original several times over my life, but it's been a while since my last playthrough. To me, the remake is better than the original (even in capturing the things that you feel like the game didn't capture), barring nostalgia.\n\nWhy does everybody seem so on edge about this remake?\n\nBecause the original is widely considered the best horror game ever, so people assumed a remake could never live up to the original and said so before the game came out.\n\nUnfortunately there is a well documented flaw in humans that once they say something, they have an extraordinarily difficult time saying, \"Turns out I was wrong.\"\n\nNever have an early opinion about anything. You'll be locked in forever the second you open your mouth.\n\nFor me it was the fact that Bloober teams previous outings have been mediocre at best and a dreadful technical experience at worst and handing them the keys to a silent hill game seemed like a bad choice right out the gate.\n\nTurns out I was wrong.\n\nBloober's previous games are a mixed bag and none of them are masterpieces, but they've always completely nailed the atmosphere of whatever they're going for.\n\nSilent Hill's entire thing is atmosphere, so there was always some hope.\n\nsome people had concerns about how Bloober would handle the combat for the remake (since most of their previous games didn't have any combat) and it turned out alright. though I think these people forget that OG Silent Hill 2's combat was not that good lol\n\nIt mostly stems from the original's lack of availability. You have to pirate it or pay 200 dollars for a PS2 copy. There was a remaster for 360/PS3, but it is considered one of the worst video game remasters of all time.\n\nTo release a remake while holding the original hostage feels like erasure of the original.\n\nThis is what pisses me the fuck off. It totally undermines games as an artform to give Konami money when they let their back catalogue rot as abandonware. \n\nIt's like selling posters of the Sistine Chapel while the real thing is left to crumble.\n\nI feel the same way. Silent Hill 2 was such an important accomplishment for the medium, and it deserves basic respect. Right now there is a soulless corporation keeping it captive while capitalizing on its fame. It's morally bankrupt, and I refuse to pay them money to enable them to do it.\n\nSlight spoilers for the first 20 minutes\n\n----------------------\n\n\nI thought my game was bugged out when I got to the construction tunnel expecting the radio and lying figure there.  I hit my x button and james just stood there unable to move for a moment.\n\nIt took me a while to realize, after i apprehensively made my way into the town that this was more of a \"hey you were expecting something here but now it's not\"\n\nmakes me think of \"there was a hole here, it's gone now\"\n\nI did the same lol, having just re-played the PS2 version days beforehand (via emulation this time round) and wondered wtf the radio isn't there and tried to go back and stuff looking for it.\n\nLooks great, can't wait to play it in a couple years when it's not 94 fucking dollars.\n\nTHIS. I went to check it out on Steam... no god damn thank you.\n\nI can't tell them apart until digital foundry tells me what to be upset about.\n\nI swear this is what I read when mass criticism happens. It isn't a single opinion, but a mental copy paste.\n\nCan’t wait for “real OGs” making 2 hours essays full of “But in the original…“\n\nBoth games are gorgeous, just in different ways\n\nAnd that's hard to achieve. Kudos to them.\n\nI love both of them\n\nI read somewhere that \"Most people that played silent hill 2 did it through a 2 hour video essay\" and I fully believe it's true lol\n\nThe original silent hill 2 had around a million total sales\n\nAnd yet it's apparently everyone's favorite horror game of all time.\n\nSure there are some emulated, but most peeps were just told to like it and said \"ok\".\n\nHappily proven wrong. Was a hater in the beginning. Bloober team? more like Noober team, their games aren't that great. The medium could have been cool if it wasn't a technical nightmare.  Glad to be wrong.\n\nI hope with the success of the remake it leads to remakes of 1 and 3. SH1 is such a masterpiece.\n\nI’m praying for a SH3 remake!\n\nGoddamn that looks insane\n\nIs this game worth the full price? Serious asking for those who played. Never played the original but have seen playthroughs. Still debating on wether I should get it\n\nYeah, it's brilliant.\n\nHoly shit. Gaming has made so much progress.\n\nThe art direction in the remake is both unbelievably beautiful and unnerving at the same time.\n\nEven with all the upgrades, nothing improves James’ parking skills.\n\nCurrently playing the ps2 version.\n\nRemake looks way darker\n\nA torch is definitely needed, thankfully silent hill affords one with unlimited battery!\n\nI'm playing Alien Isolation for the first time right now, and boy that flashlight dies pretty fast without many battery pickups around.\n\nThat station is in dire need of a shipment with resources. Everything is scarce but your fear.\n\nSemi-realistic global illumination. The original had no lighting system of any kind let alone one approximating indirect light and occlusion.\n\nsomething about the graininess in the first one that just holds up.\n\nThe wind and fog in the remake is unmatched as good as the original is.  Holy shit this game looks incredible. The sound design is insane. WIND CHIMES IN A VIDEO GAME? Each of James' individual breaths can be heard and it's super, super creepy\n\nNgl that remake shot looks fantastic\n\nThis takes me back. This is the only silent hill that I beat. It was rough.\n\nI haven't played Silent Hill 2 before, but watched playthroughs. Is the remake worth it for someone who hasn't played it before? I've played the RE2 - RE4 remakes. Where does it fall among those in terms of old/but new stuff?\n\nPeople keep bagging on remakes but as long as it’s not a glorified port and is a proper REMAKE; I think they’re brilliant for the most part.\n\nWow the original is a vibe despite it being limited by it's tech. Artstyle cleared back then."

    "all_comment_text": "To be fair, there is no understating how much of a big cultural influence Dragon Quest has had in Japan, as well as Akira Toriyama's art. It's like telling writers to not be influenced by Shakespeare.\n\nMore even than that, though it is true: how many of these are just influenced by real life creatures and/or Asian mythology?\n\nI mean that's why the suit is about a patent and not any character designs.\n\nagree. A lot of these designs seem inspired by real animals and mythological creatures. The patent focus makes sense if the designs are really about unique features\n\n2 of the images shown here are literally just bats...\n\nBats, rats, crabs, bugs, and other animals extremely common in our collective experience as humans. \n\nAnd the purple farting smog monsters native to almost every continent. \n\nI didn’t realize people from New Jersey had spread so far.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/t85oKZx.jpeg\n\nit is actually native to all continents.\n\nBecause it is based on cold virus lol.\n\nEven dragons. Every culture on earth has a dragon myth of some kind or another.\n\nYeah, half these designs are just mythological creatures and the other half are just animals.\n\n\nLike OH NO!  THEY BOTH HAVE A CRAB!\n\nAbsolutely Cancerous designs!\n\nNot just any crab, a giant enemy crab from Japanese history at that.\n\nYeah, basically every one of these examples is just a variant of a real-life animal or a dragon, as if Dragon Quest invented bats and birds. The ones that aren't real animals aren't even particularly close: how is a Magmalice/Lavabasher, the clump of magma that rising out of the ground to form a separate head and fist, the same as Geodude, a hovering rock head with arms? Just because they're rock-related? Dragon Quest's great sabercat (under the 9 in the image) is compared to Growlithe, they're both minor variations on real animals but not even the same animal, a sabercat is based on a saber-toothed tiger and Growlithe is a fire breathing puppy. A gastank (purple gas monster to the left of the sabercat) is compared to a Koffing but their only similarity is that they emit gas, Koffing is a floating expressive head and a gastank is like an obese man with a huge belly and stubby legs.\n\nDragon Quest was definitely influential on all JRPGs but this image is silly. If you're going to accuse the gen 1 Pokemon of copying something it'd be real-life animals and the laziest examples like Seel, Beedrill, Pidgey, Ratatat, Ekans and Krabby being basically just real animals outright.\n\n&gt; Beedrill\n\n&gt; just real animal outright\n\nI sure fucking hope not\n\nA better analogy for modern western media is Tolkien\n\nTerry Pratchett on Tolkien\n\n&gt; J.R.R. Tolkien has become a sort of mountain, appearing in all subsequent fantasy in the way that Mt. Fuji appears so often in Japanese prints. Sometimes it’s big and up close. Sometimes it’s a shape on the horizon. Sometimes it’s not there at all, which means that the artist either has made a deliberate decision against the mountain, which is interesting in itself, or is in fact standing on Mt. Fuji\n\nThis. Having monsters similar to dragon quest is like writing a book about elves, those are the standard tropes now.\n\nok picture this - ridiculously good looking orcs, and hideously ugly elves\n\nThat's still Tolkien-esque, just with a twist.\n\nI mean that pretty much just tolkien anyway since the elves and orcs are originally the same species.\n\nAlso don’t forget Frieza’s 3rd form.  Even the best have influences\n\nIt's a patent lawsuit. Nobody knows about what specifically. But it's not about copying monsters. \n\n\nI'm just guessing here, but maybe catching pals with pokeballs wasn't that good of an idea. \n\nDetails are still iffy, but it seems there are two main mechanics contested by these patents: aiming and throwing a capture object in third person, and specific prompts related to a character switching into a mount/ride (I'm still trying to confirm the second, since it covers way more than just Palworld).\n\nIf this is the case then it's 100% patent trolling.\n\nThen no need to believe it until we see it. Palworld devs will gladly tell us immediately. They don't have more Infos themselves yet so no need to make our own ragebait. \n\nYou can call it “trolling” in a general sense if you think it’s frivolous, but “patent trolling” has a very specific meaning (buying up cheap patents that you have no intention of using in your own products and instead will just be used to sue and harass other people) that doesnt apply here\n\nsoftware patents should not exist.\n\nBetter call your congressperson's office TODAY then.\n\nhttps://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/09/software-and-genetic-patents-are-up-for-debate-again-in-congress/\n\nI love patents, but some (most?) of the software patents that have been granted are absurd. Videogames are especially bad.\n\nIt's one thing if you have a process or algorithm that took meaningful investment &amp; innovation... It's another thing when you have an idea like: \n\nlets put a minigame during loading screens.\n\nLike the software patent of putting an item in a shopping basket on a website.\n\nLike when they patented the Nemesis system so that no one else could create a game that had a system like that.\n\nAbsolutely blows my mind that they were able to gain a patent for that. It was an unoriginal idea yet, adding a little polish to the system, they somehow were able to make it so nobody else could use it. \n\nThe patent likely wouldn’t even hold up if somebody challenged it, but it just isn’t worth allocating a development budget to a lawsuit like that.\n\nI can assure you there is a reason Warner had to re-apply for the patent multiple times. It is so vague that it won't hold up because it protects against \"changing the game after it is running\" like, they patented procedural Generation? Really? And code is considered a math equation. (There are finite ways to solve a problem that is reasonable and fast) so they can't be patented. Basically don't use their variable names or their exact structure (I mean practically an asset flip) and you will be fine\n\nI feel like patterns in the game system are treated very differently from other markets. I've heard about non-game companies having their patents denied or revoked because of how absolutely vague and already available the patent was but game companies don't seem to be held the same standards. It's not just with patents though it's everything.\n\nThey sued for patent not for copyright\n\nEdit: Guys... I am not defending Nintendo, just trying to get the facts straight so people don't go around misrepresenting what this is about...\n\nBold of you to assume this sub knows the difference. Anytime legal matters come up, comments here make me wanna slam my head against a keyboard.\n\nEdit for people moaning in my mailbox:\n\nTo clarify, I wasn't saying I'm frustrated at people not knowing the difference between copyright and patents. No one can know everything. I was venting at people who don't know the difference AND THEN proceed to furiously debate how likely Nintendo is to win in their lawsuit, or how Nintendo shouldn't have the patent to begin with (without even knowing what Patent is being enforced). That is what's making me want to slam my face against a keyboard.\n\nAnyway, Copyright is for literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works. Nintendo are not alleging that any of this was stolen.\n\nPatents are for inventions, processes, or scientific creations. We don't know the specific invention(s) Nintendo is suing over because this information hasn't yet been published. All the articles and comments are just guessing. They have **thousands** of patents in their portfolio. \n\nAlso, Nintendo has not \"patented throwing a pokeball\". The scope of legal protection in a granted patent is defined by the claims section, not the patent description, figures, or title.  It will be much more specific and nuanced than that. Patents need to have a technical effect. Plus software patents are banned in most jurisdictions. Please stop saying Nintendo is trying to enforce a monopoly on throwing pokeballs!\n\nI’ve seen comments say “but there was a cgi trailer  YEARS ago! Bit suss Nintendo is only now doing a patent lawsuit!!” People have no idea what things are haha\n\ni know exactly why. they used balls/spheres to catch monsters while every not yet sued monster catcher uses cards/discs\n\nMonster Rancher\n\nRanch me up, brotendo\n\ni meant something like TemTem casue that IS a \"pokemon clone\" and yet was released on switch\n\nBird up\n\nLooks to specifically be an Arceus Legends related catching system. Not just any catching with a ball. The first pokemon games came out in 1996; if they did have a patent on that it's long since expired.\n\npeople in all the gaming subs have brainrot\n\nIt's a Reddit-wide problem. Any time literally anything gets posted here, everyone suddenly turns into an expert in that topic. It's not just gaming subs, it's the average Redditor's inability just fucking not know about things sometimes. The system where we vote on not only the content that gets posted here, but the comments as well, incentivizes people to have an opinion on literally everything they see, even if they have even less than average knowledge on a given topic (which is fine, there's nothing wrong with that sometimes).\n\nAnd as long as it is worded convincingly it doesn’t matter in the least if it is complete fucking nonsense. If you’re actually well versed in any subject you will see the most baselessly incorrect shit upvoted to the tops of comment chains all the time because someone responded early with an authoritative sounding completely wrong contribution.\n\nAnd it's fucking *impossible* to debate it, because if the early opinion is confident, and *any dissent at all*, regardless of how factual or informed is, will be downvoted to the double digits. And people are less likely at all to vote on super highly or lowly voted comments at all after a certain point, so these well-informed comments just stay at that level, to be regurgitated by the 99% of laymen who \"became experts\" on the subject simply by reading that incorrect statement. \n\nIf given all the world's knowledge, people would be **morbidly fucking shocked** at how many bad/incorrect takes are at the top of subs like /r/bestof, or how many correct, informative takes are buried and seemingly not even indexed in google searches.\n\nsocial experiments showed many years before how humans are. If 5 people select the wrong choice the 6th will follow if he/she does not agree\n\nLiterally every single movie that doesn't turn profit is *mOnEy LaUnDeRiNg* according to this website.\n\nCovid happened. They tried to learn over zoom. \n\nReminds me of when the whole GameStop thing happened and people were literally saying shit like \"Reddit just took down the stock market\" as if that was anything close to what actually happened.\n\nIt helps if you remember that most of the people on here are probably teenagers\n\nYou still have a keyboard? Mine is already stuck on my forehead\n\nDo we know the exact patent(s)? I'd assume it's the \"capture sphere\" that they're going after. That's the only thing I could see them even remotely having a chance to win.\n\nThey didn’t list them and there’s multiple patents they’re saying were infringed.\n\nWatch the patent have nothing to do with Pokémon, biggest twist in gaming history. They go into discovery and they have a whole bunch of document about like aiming mechanics in Metroid prime.\n\nThat would be hilarious.\n\n\nI'll bet the truth is it's something extremely boring. Like exact statistical mechanics of something.\n\nIf they’re actually going after Palworld, this long after release, it leads me to believe they found something that was *actually* stolen. And usually in these kinds of scenarios it’s exactly that boring. My guess is they stole an algorithm of some kind and Nintendo is now able to prove the math works the same way. Just my guess.\n\nThat's my guess, they have very likely been pouring over pal world with a fine toothed comb looking for anything then could sure over. Hence it taking them so long.\n\nWhat a boring job that would be tbh\n\nBoring sure, but given it's in the legal department it's probably got a very generous salary\n\nSomeone in another thread was saying that a patented loot pickup mechanic in arceus legends might be a contender\n\nWhat is the loot pickup mechanic in Arceus?\n\nIn their statement, Nintendo says the suit is being filed “together with The Pokémon Company,” so as funny as that’d be, it’s definitely Pokémon-related\n\n&gt; Watch the patent have nothing to do with Pokémon\n\nThe lawsuit was filed in conjunction with The Pokemon Company, so I would be *really* surprised if it had nothing to do with Pokemon\n\nNintendo claims a *lot* of patents on things in Japan. Fast travel, summoning a mount, summoning something to fight for you, etc.\n\n&gt; Fast travel, summoning a mount,\n\nWait, then how are 99% of modern RPGs allowed?\n\nThose patents are valid only in Japan, not in most other countries.   \nGoing after a western company for patents that don't exist in western countries is doomed to fail.   \n\nAlso, the legal process would be lengthy and expensive, so they only bother when it's really egregious, which Palworld is (from their point of view).   \n\nIf Pocketpair wasn't a Japanese company, they would have a lot more trouble suing them.   \nPerhaps a non-Japanese company would be prevented from selling their product in Japan, but wouldn't be affected otherwise?  \nIt's a gray area and there are no practical examples of that happening, as far as I know.\n\nGood question.\n\nAll Japanese video game companies claim tons of patents. This goes back to the beginning of arcade gaming in Japan, where video game companies had to fight patent trolls from outside the industry, by patenting all kinds of mechanics (including basics like title screens and high scores), but not actually enforcing them.\n\nPatent lawsuits are rare in the video game industry and everyone is jumping the gun to say this is definitely frivolous without actually knowing any of the details. But the last time Nintendo sued another company for patent infringement it was the other company that was trying to enforce a patent for a basic mobile control scheme before Nintendo's lawsuit stopped them.\n\nIt wasnt a capture sphere, it was specifically the 3rd person over the shoulder view overworld capturing mechanic that they’ve used in legends arceus and scarlet/violet\n\nThrowing an object from a 3rd person over the shoulder cam, it's honestly going to be a tough sell for them.\n\nNot if they've gotta sell the idea it was stolen to an 80 year old\n\nYeah alot of nonsensical lawsuits were won on the past because the judge had no idea about the subject matter and the lawyers had an easy time to convince them of their nonsense\n\nBro is describing you watching someone throw something\n\nNot in Nintendo biased Japanese courts\n\nI didnt say it made much sense, i was just trying to clarify\n\nThat is probably one thing, but how are you sure it is that, they haven’t said anything specific.\n\nPatents are worse though. Patents are vague concepts with less oversight which don't even require usage of the patent \n\nLike WB not using the nemesis system in a game since shadow of war lol.\n\nExactly. The concept of a random NPC enemy becoming a recurring antagonist is such a cool concept, yet they never bothered to use it again. \n\nIf you can't profit of an idea, make sure nobody else can as well.\n\nIngenious innovation from our capitalist system.\n\nOne of my biggest peeves with the industry. As if those games would exist without Assassins Creed and the Arkham Games before it. I know that WB published Arkham, too, but the point remains that Shadow of Mordor was a game that stood on the shoulders of games and mechanics that had come before.\n\n[removed]\n\nHas Nintendo ever sued another original game for patent infringement?\n\nThey sued Shironeko Project over touch movement back in 2018.\n\nApparently it wasn't just a \"simple\" patent infringement, I read a little about it and it doesn't seem like it's the same thing.\n\nPatents are the opposite of vague, and patent attorneys go through great lengths to ensure that they are not vague. A vague patent is an invalid patent (See 35 U.S.C. 112(b))\n\nEven if that wasn’t the case, OP won’t put a “Palworld vs Pokémon” picture up like this one. \n\nWhy? Palworld designs look a lot more similar to Pokemon. Some are almost 1-for-1 rips lmao.\n\nThese aren't that similar, anyways. As if Dragon Quest owned dragons, bats or ghosts and didn't take all of these from folklore.\n\nThat is worse as the patent system is broken\n\n[removed]\n\nWhat are Japan's patent laws like?  \n  \nbecause all this is in a Japanese court\n\nAh so they're patent trolls.  This helps Nintendo's image.\n\nAside from that, the \"copying\" is kind of a stretch. Many of those don't even look similar at all besides that both are \"crabs\" \"Birds\" or \"Dragons\"\n\nAnd the common smog monster\n\n\"Palworld \"infringes multiple patent rights\", [Nintendo and The Pokémon Company said in statements posted on their websites, external](https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/en/2024/240919.html).\n\nPocketpair said in [**its response to the lawsuit**, external](https://www.pocketpair.jp/news/news16) on Thursday it would begin taking action on and investigating The Pokémon Company's claims.\n\nBut it added that it was \"unaware\" of the specific patents that it had been accused of infringing.\n\n\"We have not been notified of such details,\" it said.\"\n\n\\[[Source: BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c89lx7xdwd5o)\\]\n\nI'd be interested in knowing the speciifc patents are in question.\n\nHaving a look at TPC's patents, I believe the most likely ones are:\n\n\"In a first mode, an aiming direction in a virtual space is determined based on a second operation input, and a player character is caused to launch, in the aiming direction, an item that affects a field character disposed on a field in the virtual space, based on a third operation input. In a second mode, the aiming direction is determined, based on the second operation input, and the player character is caused to launch, in the aiming direction, a fighting character that fights, based on the third operation input.\"\n\nand\n\n\"In an example of a game program, a ground boarding target object or an air boarding target object is selected by a selection operation, and a player character is caused to board the selected boarding target object. If the player character aboard the air boarding target object moves toward the ground, the player character is automatically changed to the state where the player character is aboard the ground boarding target object, and brought into the state where the player character can move on the ground.\"\n\n[\\[Source\\]](https://patents.justia.com/assignee/the-pokemon-company)\n\nEssentially the 3D capture/Fighting mechanic and the switching between Aerial and Ground mounts. If I'm correct in which patents I think are the subject of the lawsuit, they seem to have been filed after Palworld was released, but I'm unsure of how the system works from a retroactive perspective. \n\nAlso, not a Lawyer, just access to google and too much time on my hands.\n\nInteresting, the air/ground mounts thing is something Final Fantasy 14 has been doing for years, switching between a flying or running state based on your proximity to the ground.\n\nIirc, FF4 had an air ship that could do something like that.\n\nI have a ps1 game from 1998 that does that\n\nI believe it's more likely to be the first, given Palworld mounts don't transition from air to ground but keep the same mount and, in most cases, just have the air mount hover as a \"ground\" mode. The player does not automatically change to be riding a separate ground mount upon contact with the ground as detailed in the patent.\n\nYeah, I don't think it's that one either. Palworld basically mimics how Ark flying mounts work and Nintendo hasn't sued Ark, which has been around longer and probably made more money.\n\nSo why don't pokemon file a lawsuit for ark? They have cryopods like pokeballs and mounts that can both fly and run. This sounds stupid\n\nIf I had to hazard a guess, I'd say it's something to do with Palword being consistently referred to as \"Pokemon with Guns\", and Nintendo don't like that. But thats just a guess\n\nyeah I hope they lose the lawsut on basis that they didnt defend against the many other examples of games doing the same. All these patents are stupid because they are stuff in a simulated environment, they dont describe the exact mechanics IRL that let that simulation occur, just the results of it, which is   what should be patentable but for that copyright in code already exists\n\nThey are suing patent infringement. \n\nSo more like how the ball wobbles or the fact that you fight gym leaders.\n\n[Nintendo has filed a patent infringement suit, not a copyright suit for what the characters look like.](https://www.reuters.com/technology/nintendo-pokemon-sue-palworld-producer-patent-infringement-2024-09-19/)\n\nTIL Dragon Quest invented crabs.\n\nAnd beetles. Very rare to see those in Japanese media, you know.\n\nA vast majority of Pokémon are just animals and different interpretations of yokai and local myths.\n\nIt's a *little* different than having almost the exact same design as Cinderace, just green.\n\nI can get behind the fuck Nintendo sentiment, but come on guys.\n\nthe cinderace and luxray knockoffs just feel so shameless. Especially when the game has many other solid, original designs.\n\nOr that water snake that is literally *just* Serperior\n\n“So here’s this giant enemy crab.”\n\nI thought those came from Liverpool.\n\nDon’t forget rocks.  Can’t believe nobody thought of rocks before\n\nSo many of the monsters are from Japanese and other Asian mythologies.\n\n\"Dragon Quest sues God for copyright infringement\"\n\nActually crabs have been designed independently multiple times by different franchises. It's called convergent character design.\n\nCarcinisation - any shallow water location can, and will, involve crab enemies.\n\nNot just shallow water, spiders are effectively land crabs\n\nOutstanding\n\nAnd catapillars and things with shells\n\nAnd Chinese dragons. Turns out all my local Chinese joints are also infringing on Nintendo.\n\nI always thought it was my Ex that did that.\n\nWe can insult Nintendo as much as we want but at least let's not misinformation. Nintendo is suing Palworld not for copyright infringement but patent infringement (which is still BS btw).\n\nHow do you know it's BS?\n\nBecause they have probably patented something hugely generic like \"throw an item to capture a creature you can summon at another time\" (EDIT: This is an example I've pulled pi my ass just FYI). It's like WB patenting the Nemesis system so no other game could develop a similar system. or the Crazy Taxi devs patenting the use of an arrow over the car to tell you where to go etcetc. It's al just nonsense\n\nThe Bioware dialogue wheel is patented as well\n\nI didn’t know that and it kind of makes me sad because it’s my favorite type of dialogue choice in games. And I always wondered why other RPGs or games in general didn’t use a wheel like in mass effect or dragon age, now I know\n\nIf it makes you feel better, it was filed for 2006 so it should be expiring soon. (Patents only last 20 years)\n\nIs that why there is no nemesis system and only shadow of war games had it!? My god that is the coolest system and would be wild in so many games\n\nI always wonder if any developer has made serious inquiries into leasing it and what WB's price would be in that situation.  \n\nIf it's like 1 million, then that's not all that much in the grand scheme of the cost to make an AAA game.  If it's 100 million, then WB, to nobody's surprise, is just being a bunch of dicks.\n\nIt's probably just too much risk being beholden to a competitor for game mechanics &amp; licensing them is a terrible precedent. \n\nWorse, the threat of a lawsuit can scare people away from vaguely similar systems, so not only is something interesting dead, so are any innovations &amp; evolutions of it. \n\nWhat would have happened if a 1up/extra life was patented? Jumping on an enemies head? Double jumping? First person shooters? First person *perspective?*\n\nThank god software patents didn't exist for the first 30 years of video games or this wave of nostalgic boomer shooters would be the first Doom clones allowed.\n\nThere is no evolution in palworld, only subspecies, as in a electro pal comes with a fire variant where he will have a red color scheme instead of yellow now.\n\nIN this case, the patent is for... the mechanic of capturing monsters with balls and releasing them with balls. \n\nI like to see nintendo suing Bakugan Toys\n\nYou don't capture bakugan into balls though, they just are balls. I think the patent might be exclusive to video games\n\n[deleted]\n\nBakugan monsters are the balls tho unlike pokemon where pokemon and pokeball are different object\n\nWhatever it is, the patent is not merely about catching creatures in balls. Patents last 20 years. It can’t be anything that was in the original Pokémon games, otherwise the idea is more than 20 years old. It’s will be much more narrow and specific than that.\n\nPeople think it's to do with throwing the ball out of your character into a 3d space (the game world) and having a a character appear from the ball on throw.\n\nIts first appearance was in Arceus and was made a patent after it's release.\nProblem is that Palworld was in development before the patent was created so if they can prove that, the case will fail.\n\nAh, that’s a more reasonable speculation. Kind of amazing that that particular feature was never seen before Arceus, though.\n\nIn otherwords, no one knows if it's bullshit or not, it's all just speculation. \n\nAnd I'm not trying to defend any corporation here, but there's a lot of people forming strong opinions over a situation there isn't enough information to form an opinion over. People should just wait to see how the situation plays out.\n\nBold of you to assume they didn't already hold these views and just needed a reason to share them XD\n\nAs a DQ fan, this pic never makes any sense to me. But whatever fits your narrative, I guess.\n\nme when two artist who come from the same cultural background pull inspiration from the same myths and animals\n\n🤨😳🤯😱\n\nThe point isn't that DQ and Pokemon both have orange crabs. The point is that Palworld took Serperior, made it blue, and added Primarina's hair.\n\nSeriously though, look at Robinquill vs Decidueye. Or Lyleen vs Lilligant. Anubis vs Lucario. Like...there's a lot.\n\nVerdash vs Cinderace, Cremis and Eevee is especially blatant.\n\ni remember seeing a model comparison and they even got the small hooks of hair down to a t lol\n\nI can’t comprehend how someone would honestly look at the DQ/Pokémon example here and think it in any way compares to the blatant IP theft on display in a Pokémon/PalWorld side-by-side. It doesn’t just look vaguely similar, it looks like they literally took the models and recoloured them. The colour schemes too are virtually indistinguishable for so many pals that mere coincidence seems impossible to argue.\n\nCatching and summoning a creature to fight on your behalf seems plenty vague to skirt laws, but the art and models of many PW pals are so similar to Pokemon that it’d surprise no one if the meshes were actually identical.\n\nIt makes even less sense than that because this isn't why Nintendo are suing.\n\nAlso as a DQ fan this thing is using the the 3ds/Switch art style.  Boreal Serpeant for example.  Scroll down and click the 2019 sprite.  That's what they used here.  They used a 2019 design in the image... no bias at all in this image! Haha. \n\n\nhttps://www.woodus.com/den/resources/monster_wiki_result.php?monsternumber=1197&amp;pickedname=Boreal%20Serpent\n\nIt's because reddit doesn't understand the difference between inspiration vs copying.\n\nI saw this yesterday and as a fun exercise I hid the right side of the screen and tried to guess which Pokemon was supposed to be the ripoff. I got only like half of them right. The only ones that really look truly ripoff-ish are Geodude and Omanyte since they have the same color scheme and share all of its defining features of the DQ monsters shown. A few others are pretty arguable, but some aren't remotely comparable.\n\nIt's crazy because when this picture was first posted it was to ilustrate exactly the opposite of what OP's claiming, but Poe's Law came in swinging and here we are.\n\nThe idea of the original post (which I think was a tweet?) was that Pokemon might be inspired on Dragon Quest - or share the same inspirations with it - but gave it's own spin on the creatures design and artstyle, so much that if unreleased pokemons or Dragon Quest monsters were leaked right now 99% of gamers would be able to tell from which franchise they come from.\n\nPalworld on the other hand is not inspired by pokemon in the same way. If you grab a bunch of Pals and new gen pokemons, mix together and show to someone who has only played up to Diamond/Pearl, they have no way to tell them apart.\n\nThis image was made by a 4chan shitposter so it wasn't meant to be taken seriously. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like the rest of the internet picked that up.\n\nI swear this has been the stupidest picture in the whole Pokémon vs. Palworld story... I don't agree with Nintendo's doings, but if you can't see the difference between \"Dragon Quest vs. Pokémon\" and \"Pokémon vs. Palworld\" in terms of character design, you're simply being intellectually dishonest\n\nYeah, little bit of a difference between, \"This Pal is just 3 Pokémon stapled together,\" \"This Pal is just this Pokémon redrawn and recoloured,\" or \"This Pal is this Pokémon's face *to the pixel* on a different body,\" and \"This Pokémon and this DQ Monster are both big bats,\" or \"This Pokémon and this DQ Monster are both worms, like that isn't the least specific term in all of science.\"\n\nIf \"Platypunk = Psyduck\" to these people, I have no idea how they aren't calling Palworld a blatant case of copying. (Like, even worse than what most people said)\n\nI can't quite grasp if people genuinely don't see the artistic similarities, or if they're blatently ignoring them because Nintendo bad.\n\nI think a lot of the Palworld hyperstans were absolutely ignoring it because they liked the \"Small indie epic pwnage'd Pokemon because evil lazy gamefreak bad! Fans are revolting!\" narrative.\n\nLike jeez, I liked Palworld and am not the happiest with the state of swsh/sv, but people got really delusional about it. Palworld is fun but it's ripping off so many pokemon either directly or with only a slight degree of separation, and that is lazy and shameful. I literally saw someone try to argue that Verdash isn't a blatant Cinderace ripoff because the feet were a different size and it has neck leaves.\n\nHonestly wish the devs just made more unique designs. Even if they were shit ones ar let's they weren't a copy. But like a Loy of the ones that don't look like any pokemon are really cool, so I don't get why they had to push some of these.\n\n&gt;I literally saw someone try to argue that Verdash isn't a blatant Cinderace ripoff because the feet were a different size and it has neck leaves.\n\nOh wow, that is...blatant\n\nI don't think they're being intellectually dishonest. I think they are actually too stupid to understand the difference.\n\n\"oh yeah geodude is a ripoff of Lavaman because they're both kinda... earthy?\"\n\n\"No, slapping egyptian shit on a lucario makes it entirely different\"\n\nPalworld is fun, but there's a reason the rest of the game looks like slapped together premade UE5 assets.\n\nDon't forget \"Luxray with a slightly different tail is... uhhh... let's skip that and just say they didn't copy anything\"\n\nThey are being dishonest because those designs aren't even from 1986, they are much later versions and monsters from the series which could have actually been inspired by pokemon.\n\nintellectually dishonest posts? on reddit??? impossible!\n\nI mean imo thw difference here is that none of these look the same. They allnclearly have the same inspirations and maybe Gane Freak was indeed inspired by Dragon Quest. But none of these share outright art style elements with their parallel. The sea shell slime that supposedly inspired Omanyte doesn't have tentacles, and the type of shell is clearly different. Some of these have even less visual similarities.\n\nPalworld literally has elements of their designs that fans clocked as being almost identical, like the Primarina hair.\n\nomanyte is based on an actual extinct animal called an ammonite. they barely even changed the name\n\nKind of surprised Palworld didn't jump on the idea of 'Ammo Naught', like some giant mollusc that consumes bullets or something. I was gonna suggest Ammo Knight but apparently Splatoon already has that lol.\n\nPeople didn't mistake a DQ monster for pokemon, I wonder why....\n\nMe when I lack a functional brain\n\nOk dragon quest monster designs are actually dope\n\nIts from Toriyama sensei disposal, what you'd expect ..\n\nNintendo just publishes Pokemon games. Game Freak develops them. I understand what you're trying to say but Nintendo had nothing to do with the creation of the game or the characters\n\nSo dragon quest just copied animals then?\n\nWanna buy a shovel so we can dig up Darwin so that he may take them to court?\n\nThis sub is so goddamn stupid\n\n[deleted]\n\n*proceeds to show examples of creatures that are very stylistically unique from each other and only share generic origins based on what animal they are*\n\n70% arent even near to the same animal\n\nYeah I'm not sure what a saber toothed leopard creature has in common with a dog.   \n\nAnd oh wow, two caterpillars that look absolutely nothing alike besides being being green.\n\n[Also the two bivalves with tongues...it's based on clams and cockles using a  \"foot\" like appendage to move around](https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/z/fresh-prickly-cockles-extending-long-foot-isolated-white-background-prickly-cockles-extending-long-foot-169987803.jpg)\n\n[removed]\n\nDamn people are salty\n\nPokemon has a creature that is also based on a bat\n\n\"This copied dragon quest. They came up with the concept of bats\"\n\nPalworld uses ampharos' exact model\n\n\"They just took inspiration from pokemon and riffed on that general idea\"\n\nAkira Toriyama has been hugely influential. One of the two or three most influential artists in Japanese pop culture. So, yeah, Pokemon is going to emulate that. Because so much other art is emulating that. It's all using the same artistic shorthand and design style.\n\nBut, c'mon, *Palworld* basically painted a target on their backs. They designed a game that was basically a survival game with *Pokemon*. The monsters in *Palworld* could have looked like **anything**. They could have been like monsters of Monster Hunter or been drawn from mythology (imagine *Palworld* with griffons and sphinx). Instead they went with Pokemon ripoffs. It feels like the non-name Dollar Store knockoffs of Pokemon.\n\nHell yea i love spreading misinformation!\n\nSome of these i can sort of see, but most of these are really far fetched. Like psyduck? Sheldor? Geodude? Pidgeotwhatever? Come on it's not even close\n\nTweaked versions of animals and mythological creatures isn’t the problem here.\n\nEven though there's obvious inspiration, it's just that...inspiration. There's more than enough differences between both designs to tell a DQ monster and a Pokémon apart. There's a very huge and clear difference between inspiration and copying and pasting something. Palworld quite literally rips 3D models from the Pokémon games for their \"pals\", and very slightly changes one or two things. Oftentimes just the color or size, or mix and matching from other models. Nothing to really set themselves apart.\n\nRegardless, Pocket Pair isn't being sued for copyright, even though they very easily could and probably should since it's straight up asset theft all over Palworld. They're getting sued for the patent. Which is also something they probably should be getting sued for.\n\nI'm not one to defend the pokemon company, fuck them - they're lazy, uninspired, and their games are hot garbage lately.\n\nBut this is clearly uninformed and emotionally charged. Pokemon isn't suing palworld for designs. It's being sued for a patent violation. And honestly, some of these comparisons are trash and absolutely not knock offs. Not to mention - these are all \"basic\" level design pokemon where it's just based off of an animal.   \n  \nYou gonna tell me that the pokemon company had to copy a \"bat\" design and was only able to steal it from Dragon Quest? Give me a break. This shit just reeks of butthurt generational console wars, someone who just wants to see nintendo/pokemon burn for the sake of burning.\n\nIs there an Smt variation this?\n\nFiling patents for things in video games should be shunned. It prevents people from flexing their creative chops and innovating\n\nDragon quest first monsters came in 1992, not the original games which were rpg hero kill dragons type of game.  \nUsing monsters was mostly abandoned in 1995 in the main games as they focused on hero rpg. \n  \nThe focus on monsters only came in 1998 **after** pokemon games came out in a side game.  \nBreeding and evolving was introduced after pokemon game. In the original game in 1992 monsters were only secondary and linear upgraded as characters and got replaced by human characters as you progress, so there was no focus on them, and they were wildly different from pokemon monsters originally.  \nWhile pokemon focus on monsters fighting each other only and not people, that was copied into dragon warrior monsters game in 1998. The game was even reviewed as a pokemon copy, not the other way around.  \n  \nSo, just fyi.\n\nLets not forget this is the company that sued to remove the \"start\" and \"select\" buttons on controllers, and routinely has ROM sites taken down because they can't stand people providing the games they don't even manufacture/port anymore for free. Nintendo is and always has been a gigantic skid mark on the gaming industry\n\n1- it's a patent suit  \n2- [Palworld did use Scarlet &amp; Violet models to make Pals](https://i.imgur.com/a8ylOcS.png), which means a copyright suit would be fair too.\n\nI realise that this suit isn't about pal designs and \"Nintendo bad\" but you literally can't look at a lot of pals and not look me in the eye with a straight face and tell me they are not a copy. Some are acceptable but some are outright blatant lmao."

He is fired the first time.\"\n\nThey want an army of yes men with zero deviation, less it ruin the harmonious circle jerk.\n\nHD2 was a grand slam. but they wanted a grander slam and killed it in a spectacular dumpster fire\n\nIt’s never enough for them, never\n\nExactly. I haven’t seen a positive community response to a game like this ever before\n\nAnd I mean ever\n\nI’ve been shocked at the continuous amazing fun the community has been having and now… this\n\nLike wtf\n\nWhy does everything have to suck\n\nWhy can’t one mother fucker end up at the top and just have the integrity to not push for more\n\nWe all do the same trash at the end of the day\n\nSomeone can have a 1000 story building all to themselves with a 1 mile long space yacht filled with the things they desire most…\n\nAnd at the end of the day they sit in front a screen watching the same shit everyone else in the world does\n\nI dunno I’m drunk\n\n&gt;I haven’t seen a positive community response to a game like this ever before\n\nYep, but this is also a double edged sword as we've now seen. This very supportive community that came together over a really fun game were given another reason to come together again, albeit for a very negative reason.\n\nThe irony in this whole situation, as the HD2 subreddit has pointed out, is that the game trained the community to work together on major orders to achieve a goal. Sony essentially did the same thing IRL with their corporate greed, with the playerbase working together to voice their utter contempt of Sony's actions.\n\nAnother detail folks in this thread haven't mentioned is that the game, despite launching with the requirement of PSN linking *on paper*, has not actually required it to play until this recent announcement. The game clearly works fine without it, and even with PSN they won't offer things like cross-platform progression. Combined with Sony's history of data breaches, there is little incentive for PC users to go along with it.\n\nIt just proves beyond any reasonable doubt that gaming's biggest enemy are the executives themselves.\n\nEdit: At least now my top comment of all time isn't about idiots squeezing birds too hard.\n\nEditedit: FUCK.\n\nMBAs ruin everything in this world\n\nadd venture capital and private equity into this and it covers about 75% of America's current problems, rest is due to corporations being people legally\n\n&gt;corpos being people\n\nExcept for when they're punished for their crimes\n\nYeah. What's the old saying? \"I'll believe corporations are people when the State of Texas executes one\"? Something like that?\n\nI recall hearing about a case where a corp fucked up so badly that they were considering revoking their corporate charter which is a death sentience for a corp, but of course they didn't do that because they said it would be too much of a hardship on the employees.\n\nLet me guess. This was right before half of them were laid off and replaced by overseas workers?\n\nBold of you assume they at least elected to give more people jobs at all. \n\nProbably just funnelled the saved money into exec bonuses and stock buybacks.\n\nBuybacks used to be illegal and need to be again.\n\nMan fr, I've seldom heard MBAs actually adding value to any business. One of the most bullshit degree supported by the most bullshit people on earth.\n\nOh they add value for a couple quarters by slashing headcount and collecting stock grants, then move to the next company to slash for parts.  Unfortunately long terms sustainable profits mean nothing when you can gain short term profits and then dip before the house of cards comes falling down\n\nIs there any industry where the executives are not the biggest enemy to the consumer?\n\n&gt; Is there any industry where the executives are not the biggest enemy to the consumer?\n\n\nMost privately-held companies tend to prioritize customer focus to varying degrees. For instance, consider the advantages of using Steam. It's hard to imagine a corporate marketplace where consumers can warn each other about corporate malpractices through curators, ratings, and community discussions.\n\nHowever, if Valve were to go public and bring in a team of corporate executives, the primary objective would shift towards maximizing sales and increasing stock value. The entire layout of the marketplace would be optimized by data scientists with one goal: to make you click the \"buy\" button. The features that currently benefit consumers, such as ratings, curators, discussions, or guaranteed refunds after two hours of play, might be discarded if they were seen as obstacles to sales, displeasing the executive team. Rather than ignoring when Sony chooses not to release their latest game on Steam, the executives at Steam might instead invite Sony representatives for a round of golf to negotiate adjustments to their platform that could extract more money from consumers.\n\n\nIn the name of our lord and savior Gaben. Amen. \n\nVery fair point haha.\n\nThe Corpos were the third enemy faction all along.\n\nWake the fuck up samurai...\n\nAlways have been\n\nit’s all about money\n\nYep. And they're too dumb to realise that they would've made more money without this 10IQ chess move.\n\nIt's not about long term health.  Usually these 10iq moves extract a ton of money just for the people making the decision, then they golden parachute from the burning company and move on to their next great work.\n\nThe jack Welsh school of business, the guy ran the biggest company in the world into the ground, and is lauded for it... \n\nSome men are paid to take on the CEO position *specifically to* destroy a company. They're called \"hatchetmen\". We had to do reports on them in my business classes back in college.\n\nI haven’t gamed in years yet I’ve seen every social reaction from the game mob as they shift from new content to new content \n\nHelldivers 2 is by far the longest stream of endless positivity and fun I’ve ever seen\n\nThe only thing to derail it has been a push from Sony because they want the data from its users in order to sell to LLM’s like Reddit does \n\nSomehow Reddit has the most sought after data due to the extensive conversations the users have in comparison to any other form of social media\n\nSony and all other major companies are sharks\n\nWhen they smell blood in the water they will pile in as if they never had a meal in their life\n\nIt sucks that such a positive and enthusiastic community was turned away by an outside source\n\nNothing can be just nice anymore\n\n'Yes yes you paid already once, but what about the second pay?'\n\n'I don't think they want to pay a second time sir.'\n\n'But, sure they want to pay for dlc, skins, season pass, subscription??!!'\n\nimagine the state of gaming if executives didn't try to fuck up every single decision they make lol\n\nBut we'll all die if the numbers don't go up every single quarter!\n\nLike I'm so tired... I just wanna play video games.\n\nAll they had to do was nothing!\n\nSome PSN manager has user growth targets to hit though\n\n[deleted]\n\nFinally someone understands what it is and doesn't just go \"because marketing\" for every inconvenience. \n\nSony needs to pump up subscription engagement to look more profitable\n\nI did my MBA Dissertation on this. Not specifically this one thing, but basically the idea that metrics can be useful to check how a company is performing, but when they become incentivized targets, people begin to game the numbers and they stop truly representing what they were originally intended to.\n\nI approached it from a manufacturing stand point, but it applies to this as well.\n\nEdit: before anyone decides to link Goodharts law to me again, I'm aware it's not a new sentiment. I was attempting to adapt lean manufacturing principles (that are heavily metrics based) in *light of* Goodhart's work (as well as Frisch, Haavelmo, Muller and others).\n\nEdit 2: some of the data I referenced in the paper was based on proprietary financials for my company that I was given very narrow permission to use. If I can get it edited to remove the proprietary bits I'll put it on a Google doc and send the link out to those asking for it. It will likely be the end of June though as I'm neck deep in another project at the moment.\n\ntheir subscription model is fucking stupid as hell, paid for  PS+ for a steady 10 years but got a PC last year &amp; wont ever be paying a cent for another online sub again, the day they bring a PS+ sub to PC is the day I start pirating all their games\n\nDoing nothing is hard why Steam is undefeated \n\nEveryone else does something we will do nothing\n\n-Gabe\n\nWhen I have to review business cases for new projects at work, do nothing is always an option that we look at. I’ll bet Gabe evaluated business cases and do nothing makes them the most money since Steam is already winning.\n\nValve has kept it incredibly simple over the years while collecting that 30%. Yeah, Steam has changed since 2003 but *not that much*. My favorite thing about Steam is that it's not creating a new UI every year like some places. I swear websites like Youtube change things every few months just to fucking do it.\n\nYou mean attempt to justify c-suite salaries.\n\nIt is literally this. Since valve is privately owned they don't have to prove anything to shareholders (or anyone really)\n\nThey just have to pay their employees and maybe make a profit instead of chasing infinite growth.\n\nI wish that was most companies\n\nAlso they're not that big, they only have 360 employees and they have over 10 billion dollars in equity. We don't know exactly how much cash they have on hand, or their annual revenue or profit, since they're privately owned with GabeN owning more than 50%, but we do know that with that many employees and the amount that they make on that 30% they have to be making a killing before annual expenses, enough to pay everyone and still have a ton left over for development of new products and services\n\nI remember reading that Valve was one of the most profitable companies, per employee, compared to something like Apple which obviously pulls in much more revenue but has a multitude more staff to handle than Valve.\n\nYup it's actually kind of amazing how successful their model has been, and the lack of shareholder pressure seems to ultimately be a good thing for the company and gamers more generally. They give the best deals in the industry and still rake it in despite that. This is the sign of a well optimized business that puts its customers first, and relies on volume of sales to make the money they do. Becoming the ultimate PC gaming platform sure the hell helped with that as well, what with everyone using them as the payment processor for their microtransactions. I'm sure they love the cut they get from those kind of games\n\nI’ve also read that they have a very strong positive working environment, very flexible do what you want kind of attitude. \n\nCombine a workplace where you are under no pressure from the shareholders screaming for more and where the employees are all happy to work there and you’ll end up with a good business model.\n\n[removed]\n\nSpotify is doing this shit right now. I swear that all has gone to hell in the last year. \n\nSo much junk shoved in my face and an algorithm that plays the same three songs no matter what radio I generate. Oh you like Green Day? Here’s GD in a rock playlist,  now a pop playlist, hey GD can be kinda “folksy” so here’s some GD in your folk radio station.\n\nmemorize library pause hurry reminiscent shaggy sugar deer squash gullible\n\nLOOK! I'M DOING *SOMETHING!* I DO STUFF TOO!!\n\nAlso youtube keeps making their website less accessible. Like I need so many more clicks to get to what I want to do.\n\nAs much as I agree with this “meme statement” for fun, at the same time it drives me mad that some people still like really believe in it.\n\nSteam actually done more than any other company that runs some kind of a game store in the whole world. It might not be visible in the first glance, but amount of work they poured into not only software, but also hardware and for example SDKs for game developers is astonishing. If you are smaller developer you dont actually need to build any of network code yourself. You get cloud backups, secure login, mods workshop, community forums, release and news hub and alot more. It might seems this is not that big of a thing, but for smaller games these parts could really easily be like 30% of development time. Not to mention that if you want to have your own cloud backups for example, you have to also run whole infrastructure around it yourself.\n\nSteam does amazing job in offering whole stack for devs so they can really focus on the game itself.\n\nI'd argue that's also one of the Reason why Steam is so successfull. I'm not 100% sure about the exact wording, but didn't Gabe say in one of his interviews, that you've to offer a good service and not force people. I'd argue that's what people - both devs as well players see with steam and why it's most successfull. \n\nHaving Games at one place, achievements, trading cards, workshop and so on... all stuff people don't want to miss anymore. And i'd say the only 'other' competitors like GoG also do well because they offer a different kind of service. YOu don't like DRM - we offer you DRM Free...\n\nAnd well, i'd argue if Sony would've taken that lecture to their heart, they would've done better on helldivers. Instead of forcing people to the PSN Account-Thing where you alite 2/3 of the world, they could've just give something to encourage people to link it - ingame rewards would be one thing but also maybe some sort of features. Like as example crossprogression and whatsoever. Some PC Players also play on PS5 (guess would've linked anyway though) and might love to have progress shared.\n\nAnd also maybe reconsider the strategy on PC. I dunno how hard it actually is to pull that off, but if you go pc and steam where so many countries are available, if you really want the steamlinking (again optionally) than look for ways how also they can make one. But whatever...\n\nAnd when they decide to get up from their chairs to do something, Steam cooks pretty good stuff. Steam Deck and the new Half Life were pretty good. They are a private company and they don't have to answer to investors/shareholders and they have very steady revenue sources (like Counter Strike, a respected and lucrative brand) so there is no pressure or hurry to do anything, they can take their sweet time to do their passion projects.\n\nI just wish they would bring back Portal and Left 4 Dead, loved those franchises.\n\nThey were not cooking with that CS2 Launch though\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCrazy that that is probably their biggest L ever, which they still managed to pull back, unlike another certain studio with a Lucrative multiplayer game\n\nI think they have earned the benefit of the doubt from us costumers. Nobody today remembers it but Counter Strike GO launch and the Steam Store launch on PC were also complete disasters back in the day, everything went wrong, people HATED CS GO and didn't wanted to leave CS 1.6 and they also hated Steam quite hard (almost as much as ESG now)\n\nBut Steam came back from that pretty quickly with massive updates and manage to turn CS GO and the Steam Store into massive successes. So I gave them the benefit of the doubt with Counter Strike 2, despite the poor launch, and they did fix the game eventually. Also, the game is free, I'm not paying a penny for it which makes me more patient with it.\n\nThis big difference between hating Steam when it launched and Epic is that Steam did something never seen before and were going in blind and Epic has had twenty fucking years of improvement they could copy and know about and yet did nothing\n\nTrue. 3 years for Epic to add a freaking shopping cart to a online store was inexplicable.\n\n&gt;they also hated Steam quite hard (almost as much as ESG now)\n\nEpic Same Gore\n\nTheir biggest L ever was Artifact\n\n\"Especially not making half-life 3\"\n\n-Gabe\n\nYou don't understand.\n\nSitting on your ass and collecting money with very little effort from a surprise hit IP is *hard work*. \n\nIt's understandable they messed up.\n\nIt could have happened to the best of us.\n\ns/\n\nThat data doesn't scrape itself!\n\nAhh Sony, snatching defeat from the jaws of victory.\n\nWow I’m super out of the loop these days but they must had done a great job laying off their hands initially cause I didn’t even know it was Sony game then Sony did their thing.\n\nSony is the publisher. Arrowhead is the developer.\n\nArrowhead is doing their best to try and alleviate all the asshattery that Sony keeps doing, like find ways people can keep playing in nations that don’t have PSN. Sony keeps showing them new ways to regret using them as a publisher.\n\nIt’s pretty sad watching this dev team trying everything to help out only to watch Sony wreck any and every gesture they keep trying. With Arrowhead now telling people to keep giving their game negative reviews about the PSN requirement so they can use that in some argument with their publisher.\n\nAs for this latest move.  No telling who kicked it off, if Sony is trying to limit the argument Arrowhead is trying to make or Steam is looking to prevent massive refunds when the PSN requirement goes live.\n\nAt the end of the day, players who truly enjoyed this game and the developers who just wanted a fun game for people to play are getting royally screwed by Sony looking to dig their claws deep into this suddenly popular game. Because had this game only been half as popular as it turned out to be, likely none of this would have happened with the PSN requirement. It’s literally Sony not wanting to be left behind in how successful this game suddenly became and throwing their weight around like the massive douchebags they are.\n\nWhat's at least good about it is that the studio has managed to make it crystal clear in people's mind that it wasn't their decision, that they're not part of this an that they're 100% against it.\n\nThis should give them the leisure of staying in good terms with their playerbase and thus may allow them to have strong support should they re-brand and try to be independant when they make a new game.\n\nKinda like how Larian Studios has all the goodwill from Baldur’s Gate 3 to now separately make games without the WOTC IP they’ve gotten loyalty\n\nCompanies aren’t dumb and usually if there is a big enough outcry people will see change happen \n\nFact it’s banned in 100 countries now is insanity and that might be why they have to pivot somewhat or find a compromise\n\nIt's de listed from 170 countries on Steam right now..... Ouch\n\nThat is a lot.  Like a damn lot.  Sweet jebus.\n\nThere's only 69 countries that are allowed PSN accounts, and of those, I recall 7 require you to do it via the console itself.\n\nSome you actually can't link PSN to Steam too.\n\nEvery single place where the PSN is not available.\n\nAll can say is that this one giant pr cluster fuck.  If sony is going to stick to their guns, then they plan on riding through the fire.\n\nPC gamers had 3 months of playing this game without a psn needed and even had crossplay.  Though it was stated that it would be needed, I suspect many didn't notice when they got it, or cared.  Either way, this is ugly.\n\nWhats funny was you can disable crossplay anyway making the PSN account even less useful in a way since it was pretty clear it was optional.\n\nLarian studios had that long before BG3. They were approached by WOTC because of their work on Original Sin 2.\n\nAnd Helldivers 2 isn’t the first successful release by Arrowhead.\n\nThat Gauntlet remake is so much fun\n\nSmash hit came out of left field and they were like, great, how can I fuck this up real quick...\n\nExpectations for this game were pretty basic.  Then when Sony realized it had a hit, they ran towards the usual bullshit policies that alienate players.  Can't wait for them to try and add a gatcha system to it.\n\n&gt; Then when Sony realized it had a hit, they ran towards the usual bullshit policies that alienate players. \n\nBut... why. Sony will make less money as a result, long-term, not to mention the hit to their reputation.\n\nThis move isn't greedy, **it's stupid**.\n\nI can excuse pure intelligent greed to an extent, but pure looney tunes idiocy I cannot forgive.\n\nBecause short term profit is more important than maximum profit.\n\nSony: puts on the L-finity gauntlet \n\n“Fine, I’ll do it myself”\n\nThis is the same company that would rather make no money than a shit ton of money by releasing Bloodborne for all platforms and instead just collect dust. I’m not even surprised anymore with their logic.\n\nThey don't appear to have any logic, which is what frustrates me.\n\nI can live with greedy companies, if they're smooth and clever.\n\nSony is greedy &amp; unfathomably dumb. That combo just pisses me off.\n\nIt's a hallmark of japanese companies. They're usually extremely conservative, which means they're not going to do anything bold or even remotely out of line with the company's MO, even If it would make them millions.\n\nIt's the same for nintendo, konami and most anime studios. Porting/remaking beloved classics like old Zelda games Mario Galaxy would be insanely profitable, but it'll never happen. The entire Metal Gear franchise still isn't on steam for god knows what reason. Oh and of course anime studios are notorious for making new shows instead of continueing already popular ones. Konosuba is a massively popular anime world wide, and you know how long it tool for season 3? 7 fucking years.\n\nUnfortunately, unless I'm mistaken,\nSony owns the IP. \n\n\nWhile the DDR mechanics, the humor and writing are Arrowhead, they don't get to call the shots here. \n\n\nOnce again, big publisher showing utter asshatery. \n\n\nIf Arrowhead goes indy in the future, I will support them. \n\n[deleted]\n\nJust go to Microsoft and make the Helljumpers game they need to revive Halo's desiccated corpse.\n\nIt’s not copyright infringement, it’s ODST 2\n\nDoomjumpers. For the glory of Supreme Earth!\n\nI'm from Auenos Bieres and I say kill em all!\n\nOne of Sony's slogans is \"Play Has No Limits\", you know, unless you live one of those 100s of countries.\n\nI’m a big PlayStation fan but honestly the dinosaurs at Sony have no clue that shooting your own leg in a GAAS marathon isn’t the brightest strategy. They got one big hit service game which was literally their whole strategy for the past half a decade and now they’ll do everything in their power to kill it. All they needed to do was stay the fuck away from the goose that was laying the golden eggs but they had to conjure a PR shit storm against themselves as usual. \n\nReally disappointed in this garbage.\n\nIt's extra weird given how they recent shelled out a billion dollars to buy Bungie, specifically because they want a bigger live-service footprint. Someone at the decision making level clearly doesn't understand the market they're trying to enter\n\n&gt;It's extra weird given how they recent shelled out a billion dollars to buy Bungie,\n\nThey overpaid for a declining developer with a lot of internal problems. Then let them tell their flagship studio (ND) how to make their game. They let ND waste like 2-3? years developing a live service game just to cancel it. \n\nThey've been making a lot of bad decisions.\n\nHave a friend how was on Sound Design for ND. up top brass killing the fun out of their development of new games too. People left due to some bullshit that big brass decided should happen for the brand new IP. \n\nThat and  I didn’t have the heart to tell them the live service game they were working on should have come out in 2020 or not at all.\n\nI mean, Bungie has been fighting with their own community for almost a decade now, and is somehow still making money, so maybe they are just trying to do more of that?\n\ni went to the ps5 sub and they are defending this shit. Sure its diffrent if they  enforced rhe psn rule but not only did they not do that they sold it in natiosn where they couldnt get psm.\n\n&gt; i went to the ps5 sub and they are defending this shit.\n\nCorporate subreddits are always infested with bots.\n\nSony did a peak move for short term \"gain\", instead of letting Arrowhead literally print them money. It's so dumb, it's impressive\n\nLink your PSN and get a sweet helmet and cape or some shit! All they had to do.\n\nOh my god! It was really this simple 😂\n\nYeah, if it had been an optional rewarded integration helldivers wouldn't have a problem in the world right now which is hilarious considering how terrible their choice of action ended up being.\n\nThis whole helldivers controversy has been crazy. First steam handing out refunds despite it being over the 2 Hour mark and now Sony delisting the game all together. I thought Sony was smart(or at least pretending to be smart) when they announced more games coming out to PC day one.\n\nSony is not smart. Remember, this is the company that put Morbius in theatres *twice*. \n\nThey will fight to the death over console exclusivity. \n\nIt's the stupidest hill to die on. \n\nThis is what happens when corporations make decisions about art and creativity. Who wants to bet there'll be a wave of layoffs in the next few months?\n\nEdit: Fixed some minor grammar mistakes. Also, I just realized that Sony has been scrambling for a live service title to rival Destiny 2 for *years*. It's hilarious that, now that they finally have one, they stomp it to death out of habitual chasing of \"player engagement\" or whatever the fuck.\n\nLOLL I remember that they put morbius back in theaters cause it became a meme and it still flopped 🤣\n\nI have yet to meet anyone that actually watched it, I mean i've put it on in the background and it's so bad I have to put something else on, like rebel moon unwatchable\n\nRebel Moon may as well be the greatest movie of all time compared to Morbius.\n\nAnd rebel moon is *terrible.*\n\nMorbius is on a level of terrible that I associate with those random movies you find 30 pages down on Prime that presumably came out of a college or high school drama club.\n\nI agree, although sometimes those C level movies can be fun in a mystery science theater sort of way, especially if a little high, I think i had a mini stroke trying to watch morbius it seemed to progress in random order and things would happen with no explanation\n\nIt did make a morbillion dollars, if you look enough you'll find someone eventually\n\nroof fuel scarce society different door head domineering overconfident exultant\n\n&gt;Sony is not smart. Remember, this is the company that put Morbius in theatres *twice*\n\nTo be fair, Sony Interactive Entertainment and Sony Pictures are two different entity\n\nBut both are dumb\n\nYes, and for those keeping track, Sony is the same company that tried its damnest to keep Fortnite from becoming *cross platform* with Xbox and PC.\n\nThe same Sony that gets 30% of all sales on Fortnite on its Playstation Platforms, railed night and day against us playing with *other platforms* for the sake of some segregation for our own good BS. \n\nBaffling in hindsight considering Fortnite generates literal *billions* a year, and an easy chunk of that goes to Sony, being one of the *largest* install bases on the planet. \n\nSony literally has to just sit there and *collect* cash and they can't even do that right sometimes.\n\nThey also fought with Bungie to keep destiny 2 from being cross platform too. And fought against character transfer. \n\nBungie told them either you join or explain to PlayStation players that they can no longer play the game at all.\n\nCorporations doing corporation thing, i honestly can only feel bad for Arrowhead Studios (Helldivers 2 Devs) they poured 7 years of their lifes into this game, only to go down in flames in 2 days because of Sony\n\nIt really feels like modern Sony is allergic to winning.\n\nI think it's time to fire the upper management.\n\nUnlike Sony 20 years ago, when they distributed a rootkit with their audio CDs? Sony hardware has always been top notch, but the boneheaded management decisions...\n\nTBH they fuck up so much, I can't keep track of all of it.\n\nI can’t believe this, they’ve done it, they actually killed a GOTY in one week\n\nLess them 2 days actually\n\nI wish Overwatch community would be half as strong.\n\nIt's different here, Steam is a key part on why everything went in favor of the consumer.\n\nWe could leave negative reviews the moment the news broke. And issue refunds asap.\n\nOW players (myself included) had nothing like that with Battle.net.\n\nHonesly i've never seen anything like this on Steam, pretty crazy how an entire game can burn down with a single shitty corporate decision.\n\nThe Devs are proud for their work, the community is happy for what they got but Sony be like \"Nope we don't want it to work nicely the way it is\"\n\n\"We could be happy with the money we're making, but we could be making 1% more from data collection so let's burn it all down\"\n\nIt’s definitely not only 1% more I’d wager. Even then at the scale at which Sony operates, every additional percentage comes out to millions more so yeah for them it’s pretty worthwhile. Companies of that size literally only care about numbers. Hopefully the numbers can show that people still need to be treated as more than just consumer zombies.\n\nIt's not about 1% money, it's some guy in the higher-ups seeing a chance to show how they raised PSN sign-ups in his next powerpoint and getting a bit more of an individual pay-out.\n\nOr to show at the next shareholder meeting or quarterly results presentation.\n\nExactly, I doubt the data they might get from people connecting their PSN account is worth much at all.\n\nBased on the number of countries it's banned and how many refunds are being issued, Sony will end up losing money AND have less people to collect data on.\n\nWelcome to the corporate world. Someone from the C-suite at Sony decided that the priority was to transfer everything to PSN at all cost, so that’s what they’re doing. People with any sense left are just not high enough on the totem pole to have any influence.\n\nImagine being a Tarkov and Helldivers fan this past month lol\n\nOf course I know him, he's me.\n\nMy condolences.\n\ni saw some tarkov players say they were leaving and going to helldivers 2 right before this\n\nI feel it's more a build up that has been boiling over for a while. Ppl are tired of company's changing the agreement. Not just gaming industry but they're the most egregious. They say you'll get all dlc if you buy this, you can't play a game unless it's online, you own the license but not the game. Now it's you have to sign into PS. It kinda reminds me of battlefront 2 loot boxes.\n\nHoly shit, why inflict this kind of wound on yourself? Idiots.\n\nSony decided to put the entire clown outfit.\n\nDamn Sony is dumb\n\nalways has been\n\nYeah, if you learn about their history you will learn that Sony has been one of the most anti-innovation companies ever. Their successes in innovating happened by ambitious engineers despite corporate's effort trying to kill them, not thanks to their help, like in cases of CD and Play Station.\n\nHow to kill your darlings 101\n\nWhat the heck has happened. How can a game thats been doing so well just self destruct so quickly\n\nExecutives man. They always find a way to mess up a good thing.\n\nThey always find a way to... execute something.\n\nthey had a goose that laid golden eggs, and decided to eat the goose too.\n\n&gt; What the heck has happened.\n\nQuarterly numbers. Not even quarterly *profit*.\n\n\"Hmm. Our PSN montly users is looking mighty slim. That will look bad on the quarterly report....\n\nOh! Wait! Conveniently, we have a smash hit out of nowhere! If we force THEM to use PSN, number go up! and if number go up... Shareholders happy!\"\n\nI genuinely despise how out of touch these corporate executives are that they actually thought doing this to a beloved game was a good idea\n\nAnd it's mainly on your radar because you are probably a gamer yourself, so you understand the industry to some degree. \n\nNow imagine this but for the entirety of all companies across all sectors. \n\nThere are a bunch of human locusts making decisions based on self-serving reasons and they fuck over people's lives 24/7 because their greed paired with their ignorance knows no limits.\n\nAll they had to do is introduce PSN login, not make it mandatory but offer an enticing reward if you link to PSN and voila you will lure most of the playerbase. Boomers from Nintendo &amp; Sony board gotto go man.\n\nThis is the funniest part to me, because it's 100% true. \n\nMake an enticing cosmetic, give people the option to log in, and people absolutely will. Use the carrot, not the stick. \n\nBut that wasn't good enough for them.\n\nat first, i didn't mind that Sony had the PSN requirement, sure it was an \"inconvenient\" to associate (or create) a PSN account, but that's it.\n\nwhat i didn't know was that PSN was locked in several countries, essentially bricking the game for those.\n\n[deleted]\n\nI'm so sad for the actual Devs. They've made an amazing game, and Sony is ruining it\n\nTook them 7 years and an original IP to get this far and they only got 3 good months out of it. Man, what a waste.\n\nAnd many of them might be laid off with the excuse that the company is going through a hard time.\n\nI hope they all quit in solidarity and form a new indie studio\n\nSo what happens to all the people who bought the game on Steam where it was available, but now can't legally register for PSN? Full refunds via Steam? Potential lawsuits?\n\nThis would've 100% been planned ahead of time, part of the contracts/agreements when they signed on Sony as publisher for Helldivers 2. Were they really dumb enough to list it everywhere when they knew it couldn't run everywhere?\n\nLikely full refunds, though the onus will be on users to request those refunds themselves unless Sony tells Steam to automatically issue refunds for those regions.\n\n*Note:*\n\nYou can request refunds through Steam **for any game,** regardless of playtime. The 2 weeks/2 hours playtime requirement only applies for their automated refund system. If you fall outside those guidelines, the refund request is handled on a case-by-case basis by an actual person.\n\nETA: Sony has reversed their decision on the PSN requirement, so Steam may deny all refunds now.\n\n[deleted]\n\nSend a support ticket. Say that the changed terms/EULA make it impossible for you to play the game without violating PSN terms.\n\n[https://i.redd.it/9ukz1folufyc1.png](https://i.redd.it/9ukz1folufyc1.png)\n\nWhat a way to lose a lot of customers for future PS games\n\nThis is the key, people mocking people for taking a stand here and saying Sony doesn’t care, well they would have had an actual revenue stream from going out maybe forever and they opted for a fake PSN revenue stream (i.e. one that they would say they would have but wouldn’t) \n\nDumb.  It’s not just about this game, it was about the other games people may buy into the future and will not now.\n\nIf you're ever finding yourself unsure of what to do, remember; What would Sony do? And then you do the opposite of that.\n\nJust got my refund confirmed, fuck Sony and thank god for Steam.\n\n[deleted]\n\nAnd iirc Valve didn't lose the case (though they likely would have), they threw in the towel because the ACCC won a judgement to have Valve present their financial records as part of the trial.\n\nwow what a win for the consumer but looks like steam is complying quite well and not looking for loophole like apple tried to do with EU.\n\nIf I fucked up so badly I would be terminated on the spot. Execs who made that decision will probably get a bonus.\n\nThe end of democracy.\n\nWhere thunderous applause tho?\n\nWhat happened? I'm totally out of the loop\n\n\nedit: thx\n\nGame released without mandatory PSN account linking. After 3 months of sales, sony then said everyone now had to have a psn account linked to play, or you dont play. \n\nThe issue is that a lot of people, do not want a PSN account on a PC. In the UK, you now have to send a photo or proof of ID in order to make an account for \"purchasing\" reasons. And considering that sony has the online security of a first little pig, its easy to see why no one wants to hand over their data to them. \n\nOn top of that, PSN is not available in all countries. So this would basically be a lock out on a legally purchased game. \n\nIts basically a \"fuck you\" to gamers. Nothing new, but in this case it would seem that they fucked with the wrong crowd. Helldivers 2 players are very engaged. And it seems that even the bots and shills havent been able to hold back the wave of negative response to Kusonys actions.\n\n&gt; And considering that sony has the online security of a first little pig\n\nthat's being generous about it ahha\n\nThat phrase is going into my everyday use dictionary\n\nSony is requiring you to have a PSN account 3 months after not needing one to play HD2.\n\nLove how people commented on this situation with \"if they were actually going to make it mandatory to sign in and link PSN accounts why even sell it to countries that don't have PSN\" &amp; Sony casually delists it shortly after in said countries\n\nSame story with their PS games on PC changing words from \"account linking is optional for playing PS games on PC\" to \"sometimes mandatory\" after this whole discourse started\n\nThere goes your game of the year award Sony\n\nDemocracy no more\n\ni wonder if this will happen to all ps games on pc rn? ghost of tsushima says u need to link it to psn account too, but old spiderman games doesnt say it, but i wonder if in a month or so all ps ganes on steam will get this bs update. Ghost of tsushima prob might have outsold helldivers 2 on pc release, but i doubt that GOT will have such horrible ratings too and sell far less copy.\nThis just shows how much of a dumb fuck sony is, they could have gotten 2 hit games with crazy sells, but now both are fucked\n\nI wouldnt be surprised at all if this is their way to sneak in subscription model on their online multiplayer pc games in couple years\n\nOf course that’ll go down way worse than this but in late stage capitalism corporate greed is a force of stupidity you better not underestimate\n\nThis is such a massive fuck up.\n\nCrazy how it went from beloved to nothing over night. \n\n\nConsumers do have power,\n\n\nWith great power comes great responsibility\n\nSony accomplished what every dev/pub is desperately chasing, publishing a live service game that gets traction...and then they cut their legs off. \n\nWhoever made that decision should be terminated and blacklisted from the industry for killing the golden goose.\n\n&gt;Whoever made that decision should be terminated and blacklisted from the industry for killing the golden goose.\n\nNah they’ll just fail upward instead\n\n&gt;With great power comes great responsibility\n\nSony also recently ran that money printing machine into the ground now too, for the second time.\n\nIt's incredible how a company run by people so unbelievably stupid can still be profitable.\n\nI assume they get carried by their hardware sales. They sell a shit ton of electronics.\n\nWhile I very much disagree with Sony’s decision here…\nIt seems their choice hasn’t affected the bottom line and user engagement very much. According to steam charts there’s only been a ~8% drop in average players while I’m sure they pushed a bunch of users to their PSN platform. Overall when you look at skewed metrics this probably looks like a win to them. If people want to actually raise pitchforks they need to stop playing this game otherwise they won’t care. \n\nhttps://steamcharts.com/app/553850\n\nThe requirement to link your account has not gone through yet. As soon as it does you will notice the drop in average player base."

    "all_comment_text": "That’s unusual, normally Netflix waits for a season to end on a cliffhanger before cancelling something\n\nthe cliff hangar was wondering if they'd ever launch a game, they prob had a thing in the works\n\nF\n\nFuckin 1899\n\nI'm still so disappointed. Dark is one of the best shows I've ever seen and when I heard the creators were releasing a new show, I was HYPED. Fuck Netflix\n\nYeah :( still mad about it. Fuck Netflix.\n\nSome MBA at Netflix is making a PowerPoint presentation right now showing how they are iterating faster, they didn't even have to get a a cliffhanger before canceling! \n\n&gt;powerpoint\n\nPlease. They have an MBA. So it's called a slide deck.\n\nTrue. As you can tell, I don't have an MBA. \n\nLooking at you Mindhunter 🥲\n\nThey never released a bad game, gotta hand it to em\n\nYou miss 0 shots if you never take a shot, Brian. That’s for sure one of the strategies I’ve ever heard of.\n\n[deleted]\n\n&gt;. i always come out on top\n\nHmm tell us more...\n\n&gt;on top i mean me masturbating alone one of the following nights to porn.\n\nNo, not that much\n\nThat’s a surefire way to avoid rejection.  Even married people have to deal with rejection!\n\nMy wife doesn't let me ride my pogostick down our 55 degree driveway anymore :( rejection sucks :(\n\nIs this code for something? 🤔\n\nThe world may never know\n\n“You miss 0% of the shots if you never take ‘em.”\n- Grayne Wetsky\n\n    - Michael Scott\n\nIt's a bold strategy, Cotton. Let's see if it pans out for them.\n\nNetflix now considering just not releasing new series instead of canceling them after 1 season\n\nAnd they are probably going to increase subscription prices...\n\nThe Warner Bros pullout method\n\n“Which made Zero games”… I thought title of their game was Zero for some reason 😂\n\nThey made all the games in the much beloved Zero Franchise. Zero, Zero II, Zero Brotherhood, Zero III, Zero Vice City and the prequel Zero 0.\n\nHonestly, Zero 0 sounds like it could work as a proper game name\n\n0^2\n\nWay to spoil the sequel title!\n\n\"Hit seller and beloved game F-Zero?\"\n\n\n\"Oh, no, not that one\"\n\nDon’t forget the hidden gem Zero 3 &amp; Knucles (Featuring Dante from the Devil May Cry series of games)\n\nHeadline writing is a learned skill.\n\nCan't release a bad game if you never released a game\n\n*taps temple*\n\nThey hired one of the main producers of Overwatch, the art director behind the new God of War games, and the main writer from Bungie-era Halo. How do you fuck that up?\n\nNever underestimate the abilities of a bunch of millionaires in suits to fuck something up\n\nThey probably wouldn't greenlight any projects from the team\n\nor they wanted a battleroyale-subscription type of game for max profit\n\nThis, 1000 times, this.\n\nFucking idiot stupid rich CEO's *who don't understand video games or the people who play them* trend chasing in the most idiotic ways.\n\n\"We want you to trend chase games that came out like 8 years ago, and then when it doesn't succeed (because *that's not how people play video games,*) we are going to fire all of you to increase our shareholder value.\"\n\nnon creatives telling creatives what to do, never works. let people who make things, make the thing you hired them to make, and fuck off. if your input was valuable, you’d be making the thing yourself.\n\nMBA's also specifically hate art and artists because they don't understand it, are incapable of understanding it, and still remember that time in high school Jessica broke up with them because of their weird date rapey vibes for a dude in a band.\n\nMBA's desperately want to turn art into a treadmill. Because that's all they understand. Squeezing profit out of human misery.\n\nOddly specific but message holds true.\n\nI love oddly specific humor. =p\n\nDaniel Tosh's classic standups.\n\nOne of my friends is currently working for the business department of a state org. He does documentation on business proposals, process flows, etc.\n\nHe has multiple coworkers who are business major type people who have said, verbatim, that developers are stupid and don’t understand business requirements. Then, they have a meeting where one of the business people shows everyone else the “inspect element” tool, and people act like she’s a genius. He has done web dev before. He is a CS major. \n\nThe amount of times he comes home like “KUROI, these people are *morons*” is incredible. Of course, they’re almost all people between 40-60 who are completely full of themselves and think that 20 years working as a business consultant means they know literally everything\n\nim a graphic designer and these people are just as stupid as you say. i constantly get requested by people exactly as you describe, to make full blown commercials, along with print material and packaging design….within a few hours. these people have absolutely Zero Clue about how production works\n\nThey have zero clue how the actual world works. Business people are the literal only degrees I look down on. Getting one cause it’s easy to get a job and feed ur fam? Understandable. But most of the others? Yikes. \n\nHow do we, as a society, get it through to these corpo suits that NONE of us actually like them, their work, or their business goals? Personally fed up with fossils in suits dictating the path of neo-capitalism. It’s ridiculous. And like they said, they’re absolute morons.\n\nYea that tracks. Then they go all surprised pikachu face when their current project or initiative fails and they have to answer to shareholders. It's never their fault. Introspection kills decisiveness which is really what the C-Suite does. Cut through the BS and execute. Cept when shit goes sideways lol.\n\nYea I've knwon types like your friend. Hope he doesn't end up like a bunch of other tech suits who got the boot this year.\n\nBut you don't undestand! the project failed because the developers were idiots!\n\nNot my fault at all!\n\nTo be fair, since I've started dealing with massive multinational corporations I've learned a very important lesson... everyone is a moron, including myself.\n\nOur world is held together by scotch tape and hope.\n\nLike the Spotify ceo saying music is worthless.  Bruhhh\n\nMakes sense to me. \n\nExecs are drawn to those positions cause they’re psycho/sociopaths. Makes sense someone like that lacks the emotional ability to listen to music and have it change how you feel. \n\nMf the type to drive in silence or listening to a MAGA podcast or sumn. Deranged.\n\nI can't really say music doesn't change how I feel, but I don't listen to it recreationally. I will 100% enjoy a good opening to a show or background music for a game but outside of the context of being a part of something else I don't personally care for it. A silent car trip is something I am 100% fine with.  \n\nI'd never say it's worthless, though, cause that's a fuckin stupid opinion.\n\nI can't say all or even most MBAs are like this...but I have definitely met a disturbing number of them that live, eat, and breath _money_. It's kind of freaky trying to have a beer with them and talk about, well, anything else. Just absolutely fucking _obsessed_ with making things profitable and stocks and as you said, having _real, actual trouble_ finding value in anything cultural/artistic that doesn't immediately show value in $$$.\n\nIt's like some kind of self-brainwashing.\n\nI would definitely say 'most'. I have literally seen bright, artistically minded friends choose to go for business or finance, and morph into cold, heartless bastards. My ex-best friend even told me, quite casually, that his job was costing him his empathy, but the money was worth it. He's just one example.\n\nI'm a corporate trainer by trade.  I was once asked by a VP of Sales to put together a class for his salespeople on empathy, and be sure to \"include ways for them to fake it over the phone to increase sales figures.\"  I declined this particular fool's errand as \"unworkable and unethical,\" and the manager of training agreed with my assessment.\n\nDisturbing. But yeah, that's been my experience too. I feel dramatic saying this, but it feels like a lot of the sickness at the heart of modern American culture can be traced to that same sort of thing.\n\nI am beginning to suspect more and more that some people are measurably 'less conscious' than others. This actually gives them an advantage much of the time as they don't have to worry about pesky things like emotion, the mystery and meaning of existence, God (in any real sense, I'm talking about true divinity that exists outside of human-invented religon-- not Christian Nationalism or Islamic Fundamentalism, etc) people they screw over, the environment, etc etc. They just want a fuckin' huge watch and a Mercedes (which they won't properly appreciate, they just want it for the image). \n\nI'm just saying *some people* seem this way, I'd call it functional psychopathy.\n\nYeah, the last 8 years or so have convinced me there's a lot more functioning sociopaths in this country (US) than I ever would've suspected.\n\nIt's not just self-brainwashing.\n\nThe schools do the brainwashing because they are also brainwashed.\n\nIt's a cycle of brainwashing.\n\nReally it comes down to this: You cannot quantify creativity with numbers and metrics. It's down to personal taste, which terrifies MBA types. They make all of their decisions based on data.\n\nI worked in creative advertising as a writer, and creative there can be really beneficial to a brand in terms of recognition and establishing a mental footprint, but if the short-term conversions aren't there, the suits dump all their money into \"click here\" performance campaigns.\n\n&gt; They make all of their decisions based on data.\n\nIf you think about it for literally a minute, you realize that means *they have to trend chase.*\n\nBecause there is no data on a new idea.\n\nAnd now they’re dumping billions, as well as a significant chunk of the planet’s resources, on a technical system to make unoriginal things at a global, automated scale.\n\nGod is there a more useless job that contributes less to society than a MBA suit. Talentless, soulless parasites.\n\nThey have a useful function and we do need them. The problem is that they are wildly overvalued and given too much power and decision making ability. We need the things they do, but in most cases they should not be in charge. Look at what they did to Boeing, people are dying because the engineers and technicians aren't in charge.\n\nI think as a society we need to experiment with more flat business structures with more internal democracy. Like employee owned businesses and the like.\n\nBecause I don't think we need MBAs as much as people believe.\n\nTechnicians will never be in charge of anything, unless they get an education and move up in their careers. It’s an entry level position.\n\nEngineers in charge of an entire company can be a mixed bag. Half the engineers I went to school with couldn’t hold a conversation with their own mother, nevermind run a business. That’s okay, it’s why there’s positions like CTO and VP/Director of Technology for these types.\n\nYou generally want someone with both the business acumen and technical knowledge to run a company. The problem is that these types are few and far between who both understand the engineering and business implications of major decisions related to their products.\n\nAs an MBA with an engineering undergrad, it’s simply hard to find a good CEO because most are lacking one of the two areas of expertise needed to control costs and boost profitability without needlessly sacrificing quality or safety.\n\nLots of MBA's do it the right way: get a real bachelors, go out and succeed in their field, find themselves in a place where they want to learn how to scale their business smartly and go back for their MBA.  The key phrase is \"go back\".  People who roll straight from business degree bachelor to MBA with zero real world experience in between are idiots, the whole lot of them.\n\nI think if you do something else first, but *then* get your MBA I think that can be good. MBA just gives you the skills to administer a business, but one of the *key* skills in running a business is understanding the business itself.\n\nMBA was always supposed to be a supplemental degree. That's why it's a graduate degree, not an undergraduate degree. Basically, take your area of expertise, and learn how to leverage it into a successful business. The idea that a bunch of communications majors or whatever get MBAs and then go on to run businesses that aren't selling... Whatever a communications major would sell... That's the real joke.\n\nThat’s not really strictly true.  Star citizen is what you get when you give creatives infinite free rein to do whatever they want with their creativity with whatever budget they want.  Designing a successful game requires both creatives and business people working together.\n\nStar Citizen is a freak of crowd funding nature.\n\nWhile I agree with your final statement, with the caveat that business people do the business stuff and creative people do the creative stuff, but too often, that is not what is happening.\n\nI don't think the Star Citizen boondoggle teaches that lesson.\n\nNah, creatives need management. Star Citizen is an extreme example but it is still an example. Chris Roberts has done a stellar job all these years demonstrating what happens when you give a creative unlimited budget and no deadline. \n\nIf you don't have management to remind creatives they won't be able to afford food unless they deliver what's asked for in the time frame required, you will get no product.\n\nYou are correct, and here's God of War creative director Cory Barlog explaining exactly what you mean: https://youtu.be/e4XRmMkQcuQ?si=DF56I8MxccCJBCgC&amp;t=152\n\n\"Lack of budget, or time constraints, make you make a decision that you wouldn't normally make, but it's for the better.\"\n\n&gt;If you don't have **management** to remind creatives they won't be able to afford food unless they deliver what's asked for in the time frame required, you will get no **product**.\n\nBingo. And that's why you have _product management_ teams. This isn't a business + creatives problem, it's a business -&gt; product management -&gt; creatives problem.\n\nI'd argue star citizens business team seems to be doing alright. It's their product management that's failing.\n\nAgreed. Free reign to creatives results in either someone finally slapping down a dead end date and release what you have- Starfield  \nor  \nNever ending scope creep - Star Citizen\n\nEh, creatives given carte blanch and no oversight just leads to a different kind of disaster.  There needs to be a balance.\n\n&gt;CEO's who don't understand video games or the people who play them trend chasing in the most idiotic ways.\n\nThis. I had extremely low expectations for Netflix trying to get into gaming, and was shocked when they turned up in my game dev job searches a few years ago.\n\nI totally expected them to make some really disgusting monetization and lock it behind a Netflix sub and have barely any care for the design of the game itself....\n\nGuess they've exceeded my expectations by doing nothing.\n\n[deleted]\n\nThere is good senior leadership, you see it at the studios that aren't dumpster fires. Nintendo is the obvious one but I hear good things about some others.\n\nWorse, they can't grasp that the trend now is unlikely to be the trend years later when the title releases.  \n\nYea, it was very hot there for a while, with tons of profit. Many games greenlit then are coming out now, to a less than 'meh' response.\n\nYesterday was the first time ever that I noticed Netflix's idle screen was showing me video games. It was two mobile games, one of which was the GTA San Andreas remake shitshow. So, that's what I suppose they had in mind.\n\nI don't understand how they think this is a good angle. YouTube is doing something similar.\n\nIf I open Netflix or YouTube, I'm looking to *watch* something, not play something. This is just adding obstacles to the content I want by having giant rows of recommended games. If I wanted games, I'd open Steam, my Switch, or Google Play.\n\nBut maybe as a gamer, I'm just not the target audience for their games.\n\nYup! You bring together talented developers who create iconic characters, stories, narratives, and worlds, and force them to make a live service online multiplayer game instead. Fucking idiots\n\n\"Give me the next fortnite or go away\" probably\n\nThey made a couple of great Alpha versions of games, which got great reactions from those who saw the Alpha versions and then they canceled the project. Standard Netflix procedure.\n\nThis is probably it. They probably wanted a shitty live service cash cow and none of the ideas presented had enough mass appeal so they didn't wanna invest more into it. The best games now come from Indie studios because of this B.S.\n\nThey canceled them as soon as they wrote it up.\n\n\"We hired Ridley Scott, James Cameron and Werner Herzog to make a film adaptation of *Dark Souls* in the style of Uwe Boll with a Michael Bay aesthetic. They all went mad and resigned.\"\n\nMan imagine what a grandiose shitshow it would be if these 3 directors were actually working together on a movie. All 3 have strong characters and opinions and don't seem to be afraid of conflict, the documentary about such a collaboration would win all the awards there are to win.\n\nsomeone gonna hire them to make it but only to make the documentary with no intent of the actual movie ever being made\n\nSometimes too many ace devs can fuck it up too.\n\nA successful games project needs creative minds, managers who can merge those ideas into a cohesive whole, and leaders who can keep people focused on eventually releasing the game.  If any one of those groups gets too strong things start going downhill.\n\nThe whole Wildstar saga falls great into this... All the videos about that game from [Timothy Cain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMY5LUNdS-8&amp;list=PLI8W_yHW-3DVnpO8cXsblh4lTFEepW5fJ&amp;index=1) are worth a watch.\n\nStill sad about the demise of that game. It was really incredible, but bad performance and a not great UI really did not help people get into it. And before someone comes about the raid thing, the whole raid access thing was way overblown, the reality was that most people could not bother to do dungeons correctly and were mad they could not get into raids lol, they would have been absolutely destroyed, since the raid was much harder than any dungeon! It did create a toxic atmosphere like M+ in WoW today does though.\n\nGreat summary. Few understand this.\n\nThis is any creative project, really.\n\nI think games just have it worse because the timelines are longer and the skills are more specialized.  So your feedback loop is longer and your creatives are less likely to be able to describe what they want in technical terms,  making iteration way slower.\n\nMight I introduce you to, “Kingdoms of Amalur”?\n\nMy beloved\n\nAin't that the truth. I love when people say governments are inefficient/waste money then this stuff happens and it's like, the private sector is much worse.\n\nWhether private or state-run, you'll get about as much corruption and waste as the system allows.  With healthy democracies, voting provides a measure of accountability, and with small businesses, the market does that.  Once voting, whether via wallet or ballot, stops constraining bad behaviour, you've got a real problem.\n\nAnd still get paid their 6-7 figure salaries, and keep their positions\n\nI'm willing to bet they didn't fuck it up, but it was most likely a decision from netflix board to get out of AAA gaming, and double down on their casual/mobile games instead.\n\nAAA games are expensive, and they take a long time to show a return which is never a guarantee.  \n  \nIf the team gets to keep the IP and find another publisher then we'll know for sure it had 0 to do with the game, and 100% to do with a \"business\" decision.\n\nAlso a brand new studio is going to have all the additional startup costs on top of the usual AAA expenditures. So you gotta bring in a brand new team of people, establish what your first big project will be, and then start building that project from the ground up with no previous assets to use.  Any change in scope or ideas will have a larger effect on dev time also\n\nbeing part of Netflix means you do have some infrastructure to start with though\n\nYeah AAA is a bad economic choice and has been for almost a decade. \n\nMTX and games that exploit it have been keeping AAA afloat and even those are infested with MTX but coupled with Covid hurting development schedules AAA games just aren’t good returns on investment. They’re not consistent performers. It’s worse than movie studios right now. \n\nLikely the shift away from zero-interest.\n\nThis is the type of project you can fund for years when cash is essentially free. With higher interest rates, pressure is coming to be more effective with the cash you have.\n\nAAA games have been bleeding money the last few years, it’s a terrible industry to try to get into , even established companies are shitting the bed left and right.\n\nGame development is much more disparate than other enterprises. This means that development teams function best when it’s tight, has a clear vision, and a creative culture that works across many levels. You can’t just assemble an Ocean’s Eleven-type team of hyper-specialists and expect each unit to function as a proper team. \n\nNetflix, being a TV and Movie company, probably looked at it like a straight line: pre-production to production to post-production to release. Game development is like completely different where the ideation of pre-production and the polishing of post-production never end, and the iteration of gameplay loops, story beats, and user experience means you have to have a very strong vision and an even stronger leadership structure to keep everything firing. If the first time these project managers and the game director are working together is on Monday, you’re in trouble. This is why gaming has a fairly strong “hire from within” culture for upper/project management—you want guys and girls who understand the company, the culture, and the process more than anything else.\n\nIt’s Netflix, they specialize in fucking up stuff that previously was great.\n\n\"It's getting good? Well too bad, I already told you to put it away.\" - Some genius boss at Netflix\n\nEvery good original series ever =(\n\nI'm still bitter over Marco Polo being Canceled.\n\nNetflix has canceled so many good shows, but insist on keeping The Witcher on life support for god knows what reason...\n\nUsually they get 1 or 2 seasons out that are spectacular just to kick you in the dick (Mind Hunter, Marco Polo)\n\nOne of them suffered from gigantism after becoming hooked on nerve tonic. Another one got dismissed for not shaving off their sideburns. One of them fell into a bottomless pit.\n\nThe official explanation was that he “choked on vomit.”\n\nYes, but not his vomit.\n\nWe’re not quite sure whose vomit it was. You can’t dust for vomit prints.\n\nScotland Yard said it was best left unsolved.\n\nThe studio has only existed for 2 years. It would be my guess the netflix Execs are used to making movies that take less then a year from giving it the greenlight to having it out. They see a AAA game 2 years into production not being close to a viable project and being told it will be another 1-2 years and they pull the plug.\n\nDid they hire any actual developers though?\n\nThey were about to start their third season of production. So of course Netflix pulled the plug.\n\n&gt;How do you fuck that up?\n\n\nSoftware development is hard.\n\n\nSource: currently shitting and wondering how I'm going to solve a bug.\n\nit's also not a linear production like make a movie or TV show might be.\n\nfor most netflix original content its Idea-&gt;pre-production-&gt; production-&gt;post-production-&gt;release\n\ngames are more iterative and cycle back and forth more often\n\nI work on something super linear and somewhat well defined and it's still fucking hard. Lol.\n\nin software its often more difficult when you try to enforce linearity\n\nYou can especially see this in older PS1 era games, where last minute additions could become defining characteristics of the franchise.\n\nI mean good movies can also take iterations with dedicated directors.\n\nEventhough I like a lot of the netflix productions they are clearly just products of content mills and I dont think with that philosophy they can produce games. Maybe some slop mobile games\n\nWhat's your bug? We can rubber duck.\n\nI have a sub bug. I'm stubbing an API response using wiremock (standalone application config) and it's returning a different value. Gotta figure out why before I can use that value for the real bug. \n\n\nIt's wrong by specific fields and I don't see any methods that map it to a different model/entity.\n\nPut three visionaries in a room, and you get (at least) three different visions.\n\nNetflix execs probably demanded that they both make an instantly profitable game and one that is producable within a single financial year. \n\nThis is the same company that routinely cancels popular shows before they get a 2nd season because the numbers werent immediately record breaking. Expecting them to understand that games are complex and take 5+ years of development time is far beyond them.\n\nThey couldn’t figure out how to make a likeable game that could be monetized to oblivion.\n\nI heard it was because they wanted to stream it, but didn’t want the limitations of it. Not a good thing to be constrained too.\n\nThat makes a lot of sense. I think the games they’ve released on the platform were to test the waters and reaction was probably underwhelming. “Oh cool, Netflix has San Andreas” was undercut pretty hard when it was, “you can play San Andreas on your phone for free with a Netflix subscription”.\n\nThey probably lost faith in the project. They paid buckets of money to get all those mobile games on their platform. When they saw the attach rate to those games was absolutely abysmal, an exec with half a brain realized the whole venture was doomed.\n\nPeople who actually want to play those games, have a phone or a console or a PC to play those games, they aren't going to Netflix to play games. Customers who have Netflix to watch entertainment, have no interest in playing games on Netflix. So I ask, who is it for?\n\nMillionaires don't understand how Venn diagrams work.\n\nThey do.\n\nBut, here's the kicker that relative few pick up on: \n\n- They get paid nothing if they don't start the project.\n- They still get paid more millions when the project is run, even if it is a failure (and they knew it would be from the beginning).\n\nThey key is to spin it as not being their fault. Blame the consumers for not wanting the product...but *never* blame the product or its production.\n\nWhat about interactive stories, did they have no luck with that? Or are hero games the same thing?\n\nBlack mirror bendersnatch was  great interactive content that critics and fans both liked, but they never expanded on it or even brought it up again.\n\nDid they though? I dont usually check rotten tomatoes but its 54%. Not sure if thats supposed to be good or not. I played it on release with flatmates and it was alright but i dont remember it making too much noise. Im gonna assume it was liked by a small amount of people who actually finished it, but it never reached a bigger audience and was not considered a success by netflix. My guess is that the usual non gamer netflix crowd just wanted a show they could watch instead of being forced to play so they didnt bother finishing it.\n\nA card game like Hearthstone or a autobattler like Mechabellum would have done great for that.\n\nYeah but for the talent they had, you know they didn’t want too.\n\nHow does a corporate risk-manager-economist-whatever in suit not think of Stadia, when presented with an idea of streaming games like movies?\n\nBecause they've literally never heard of it. These are business dorks, they've only heard of Fortnite and Minecraft. Then they just ask if it's possible to stream games and the answer is \"yes, but...\" but all they hear is the yes and then we end up here.\n\nTo be fair here the streaming part was not what was bad about stadia\n\nOpposite problem most likely. \n\nNetflix is doing the subscription w\\\\ no microtransaction thing.\n\nSpending $100m on a AAA game that Netflix subscribers get for free, has no microtransactions, and doesn't appeal to the majority of Netflix's demographic is going to need to attract an absurd amount of new customers.\n\nThe games had so many A's that they couldn't be perceived in our three-dimensional universe\n\nEven a A^n field would have been unable to contain all the A's\n\nThe real Aeon Flux\n\nAlmost as many as A's as Skull and Bones\n\nThese big media companies that jump into video games thinking it will be easy to replicate the massive successes like Minecraft, Call of Duty, Fortnite,  ect not realizing how long, expensive and difficult it is to make great games only to bail at first signs of trouble, hopefully the dev's land on their feet.\n\nAlso quite a few of these mega hits sprang from the minds of small time passionate hobby devs or modders. Minecraft is self explanatory, and fortnite, while being made by a big company, was only succesfull after it copy pasted the battle royal mode that was initially popularized in Arma Mods (and eventuelly PUPG). You cant really \"mandate\" megahits like these in a corpo environment. You can maybe manage them and monetize them to the ground (CoD), but first you need that creative spark.\n\nThe corpos are a lot like those excitable pyro guys that just want to make the bonfire bigger and bigger, but they don't know how to start the fire, or how to make sure it simply stays lit for as long as possible.\n\nWhat if we burned plastic to keep the fire going?\n\nI remember being asked by an executive if we had any ideas for how to \"go viral\" while working at a precision agriculture software company\n\nThat's easy, record everything that the software manages and post any video when things go wrong/break. Best chance for things to go viral.\n\nChance of the vids being evidence of some sort of health and safety violation? What's that mean? Send it!\n\nIt was far more boring than you are imagining. We basically made a web portal for farmers to use their soil sample reports and let them view their field with the data as a heatmap instead of a spreadsheet \n\nThe most exciting thing that happened while I was there was when I crashed the login server by pasting the entirety of Mary Shelly's Frankenstein into the username and password field and pressed enter\n\nTerraria is one of the most universally beloved and highest selling videogames of all time, and its dev team can be counted on one hand (two hands if you include the people that worked on susequent updates)\n\nUndertale was a game that sold incredibly well and was so culturally impactful to the gaming scene that its premise became a cliche. It was also given to the Pope. Its primary development team consisted of just two people: Toby Fox and Temmie Chang\n\nStardew Valley is another good example I think. Basically made by one person.\n\nThe Touhou games are in a similar vein, literally all of them were made by one single workaholic that did everything from the art to the music to the coding.\n\nYea I remember buying minecraft for $5 when it was in alpha. Game was barebones and rough but you could tell the creativity and passion put into the game by one bloke. Minecraft has now become a goliath, these companies want to throw money at something and hope they can capture the same feeling. It's not going to happen.\n\nThis. Netflix is not noted for patience and the lead time on a AAA project is well past their attention span.\n\nYep the studio has only been around for 2 years most games have been taking 4 years. Lots of executives will see something costing them money for 2 years with out a finished product and freak out.\n\nNetflix isn't known to be patient. They don't give series chances to gain or regain an audience, get better, etc. Second there's a dip, they kill it (with a handful of exceptions).\n\n\nWouldn't surprise me if they were actually working on something, hit a snag or the projected timeline was longer than they expected (but probably still normal) and just killed it then and there. \n\n\nThese people don't know games, they just know the crappy Netflix streaming formula. Can't imagine it's transferable.\n\n[deleted]\n\nThey canceled Inside Job because they released season 1 into two parts and never advertised the second part so not a lot of people ended up knowing about it. They greenlit a season 2 only to cancel the show. AND it ended on a cliffhanger to top it all off. Netflix sucks\n\nWait Inside Job is cancelled?  \nFuck...  \n\nIt was like the perfect answer to \"Rick and Morty\" with a girl. Godamnit Netflix ...\n\nWe are so lucky bojack horseman got to 6 seasons\n\nNetflix is cancelling whole studios before they produce anything, now? A new record!\n\nNetflix has a game studio?\n\nThey have a couple. This isn't the only one. I applied to work for this one. Guess I know one of the reasons I wasn't hired haha.\n\nI was talking with my Fiance about that last night and had a hunch the recent positions they had up were Phantom roles, just to make it seem like the lights were still on. Some of the devs were making moves like 2 months back and left the project. The news is just coming out now.\n\nHad similar in the past. Was bummed I didn’t get the job… two months later, huge shitstorm and company buyout etc. \n\nMatrix bullet dodge irl.\n\nHad* it's past tense now.\n\nin my head i pictured a bunch of fresh “devs” all staring at each waiting for the senor ppl to show up but there was none.\n\nNetflix shut them down after learning they can't make a hero shooter with Ryan Reynolds and The Rock\n\n[deleted]\n\nMan, at least they scrapped it ahead of time. Could you imagine a major corporation dumping hundreds of millions of dollars into an OW clone and just completely missing the mark?\n\nMan, what a scary idea, I hope it never happens.\n\nI concord\n\nLmao. If burning money was a skill, Netflix would be at the top of that field.\n\n1. Open game studio  \n2. Close game studio  \n...  \n3. ...profit?\n\nAwww, I loved the Zero games… :’(\n\nI was waiting for Zero Two to come out\n\nNow I understand why my recent job application to said studio went nowhere. Too bad, sounds like it would have been money for nothing and the flix for free...\n\nHey, don't be so negative! Maybe you just weren't good enough either way!\n\nThank God, I can only imagine how badly these games would have been monetized.\n\nI expected them to be tied to a Netflix subscription tbh\n\nI hate the modern game industry.\n\nYou said it. The thing's become infested with capitalism and disappointment.\n\nThere are so many great indy/smaller studio games though.\n\nNetflix is sitting on goldmine IPs to makes games out of, most notably Stranger Things, and they aren't making smart decisions to get them made. If YOU can't make it, allow someone else to. \n\n\nOriginally we were going to get a Stranger Things TellTale Game, which unfortunately didn't see the light of day because they went under before it could finish development. Now besides the VR game, (and some mobile games) we've seen next to nothing. \n\n\nVR Game was good, now please get more made. Hoping on November 6th, Stranger Things Day, we'll hear of some video game projects in the works, like we did with the announcement of the VR game.\n\nThe thing about Netflix is they are mostly a streaming platform first and producers second. They seek out original content but aren't creating it fully in house. Stranger Things was created by the Duffer brothers and sold to Netflix but the IP is theirs and not Netflix unless there is something in the contract that gives IP rights to future derivative work to Netflix.\n\n  \nEDIT in\n\nI just looked it up Netflix does own the [game](https://strangerthings.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Video_games) rights to Stranger Things seems they did license/develop a couple of games which I never played.\n\nNetflix bought the ingredients to make a high budget video game, got nervous and then threw the ingredients in the bin.\n\nLike bro at least cook something.\n\nNetflix honestly feels like a money laundering operation. I know people who've worked there on huge teams for years, millions spent on research, prep work, trips, etc. all for the project to just get cancelled on a whim and never see the light of day. And that's just one project!\n\nthat's just regular productions though??? lots of movies and even tv shows will have people spend time doing a whole bunch of crap and then have it cancelled lmao\n\nI don't think Netflix understood they can't translate their \"throw shit at a wall until something sticks\" approach for their original shows to game development. AAA game development is much higher sunk cost industry where you *have* to focus and deliver on whatever game you choose to develop.\n\nBy that logic, I’M a AAA gaming studio.\n\nStudio never made a bad game ever, went out undefeated\n\nWhat a W. They closed before sinking 300mil into a hero shooter.\n\nBuying a studio just to cancel it is the most netflix thing to do"

Jesus! The tickets please guy is cut! He... he... he's... he's got those things. W-What do you call them. Uhm, cum gutters.\n\nSo this game *is* true to the source material. Great, thanks for confirming!\n\nOne of my favorite Indiana Jones scene is when he punches the Nazi general and throws him off the blimp after requesting his ticket. Then he points and says \"No ticket!\"\n\nThe early Jones movies are just so damn great, even Temple of Doom has some good moments and that's the worst one of the original trilogy.\n\nNot to mention the best part, all the airship passengers scrambling to produce their tickets!\n\nAnd not a single one gave a shit that he said it with a perfect American accent in Nazi Germany😂\n\nI mean, you want to be the next one thrown out of the airship? He could be speaking Wingdings, I’m still not saying anything\n\nSpeaking Wingdings 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣\n\nGet a load of this absolute ♌︎♋︎⬧︎⧫︎♋︎❒︎♎︎\n\nThis is why we need more airships.\n\nWell, what's scarier? A German Nazi in Germany, or an American one?\n\nThe answer is the American one, because you know they wanted to be there.\n\nReminds me of that scene in band of brothers where they're making fun of the German POWs and asking them where they're from and one guy answers in perfect American English that he's from the Midwest or somewhere like that. One american starts chatting witj him, his parents were German immigrants to America and they came home to Germany when called \"by the fatherland\" so he got dragged along as a teenager and then conscripted at 18. Depressing shit since most of the stories in that show are based on true events. \nThe american gives the guy a smoke and walks off. Spoiler alert, 2 mins later we hear gunshots as all the POWs are executed 😟\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if it's true, because this still happens in places that have conscription. They do it in South Korea, a person can be born in Korea, grow up overseas and spend their entire life in another country, then visit Korea at 30 years old and they will be conscripted.\n\nthe scene in band of brothers is mostly true, the writers had to make it so that the german soldier grew up in a nearby town rather than a few miles in the same town like it really happened, they felt the true story was so wild audiences wouldnt believe it\n\nThere's a similar thing slightly later with the Assault on Brecourt Manor.\n\nIn the series, Buck throws a grenade, and it hits a German in the back as it explodes.\n\nIn the book, Buck throws a grenade, and it hits a German in the *head* as it explodes.\n\nIt's even crazier in reality. Buck was a pitcher for the UCLA baseball team before the war, and he mentioned that when he threw the grenade, it flew in a straight arc. The guy literally pitched a grenade like it was a fastball when he killed that German soldier.\n\nThe German in question was from Eugene, Oregon. I know because it was when he was talking to Malarkey about how they were both from there and apperantly my father grew up with Malarkey's grand kid. Not so fun fact the Nazi party claimed they needed all german expats to come back to the father land far before the war started and a lot of ethnic germans were still in the mind set that they were German at heart so they answered, these soldiers were often sent to the far areas of the war to hold locations that they knew would be a meat grinder such as the pacific wall and the following defenses.\n\nThey were there. A whole bunch of German Americans moved back, to answer the call of the fatherland. So it actually wasn't all that surprising for Nazis to have an American accent.\n\nKeep in mind it's set before ww2 actually started and before the nazis truly unleashed their evil side. Things were tense at the time but people were still allowed to travel relatively freely in Europe.\n\nThe fun thing in the game is that he actually throws out one liners when you shove people from ledges etc.\n\nAny examples?\n\nI pushed a guard off a bridge and Indy said \"look out below\" then snickered. \n\nthere's a bunch of very Indy-esque one liners and jokes. honestly it's a great game. The story could **easily** be a feature film.\n\nIndy is a stone cold killer Jesus\n\n[removed]\n\nIndy approves this message.\n\nevery time Voss gets punched in the face, knee'd in the balls, or headbutted, I chuckle.\n\nDude's a great villain, you love to see him hurt\n\nhe really is a good villian. I think it's that extra level of sociopathic manipulation he does on even his own subordinates.\n\n„Nazis… I hate these guys!”\n\nIt’s nazis. We all get a pass racking up a body count when it comes to nazis.\n\nMurdering nazis makes you a hero (same for evil CEOs)\n\nDo i get double points if they're a nazi ceo?\n\nTriple points imo\n\nindy was kind of a bad person in raiders of the lost ark tbh.  more of an anti-villain than an anti-hero (he gets better at the end).  you just don't notice because he's up against the wehrmacht lol\n\nDo you mean Temple of Doom? That one is set first, and if I remember correctly (its been a while since I've seen the trilogy), he's more villainous in that one than in Raiders.\n\nEdit: nevermind, just realized you said the Wehrmacht. Funny, I don't remember him being that bad in Raiders, guess I'll have to rewatch them 😅\n\nWhat's funny is that you basically do stealth assassinations and can whack someone in the face with a sledge hammer or pick axe, but his quips imply that he just beat them up.\n\nAnd then there's a stealth component similar to MGS where you can just stack up bodies and if you manage to hide they just stop looking for you and go back to their business while corpses are at their feet. It's actually way more enjoyable that way.\n\nYou also get those funny moments where you're sneaking with your companion and they're just casually walking right in front of enemies but don't trigger their aggro lol\n\nHe maneuvered a dude into getting blended by airplane propellers. He really didn’t care about death lol\n\nI was actually kinda shocked by the stealth takedowns. In the films he gives them more of a bonk on the head and knocks them out, we assume they're just unconscious. In the game Indy is full on smashing their skulls in with a sledgehammer or pushing them off 40ft high platforms to their death. I think Indy's got a higher kill count than with B.J. Blazkowicz by now 🤣\n\nWhen I pushed a guard off a building he said ‘Try to land on something soft!’, when you steal money he’ll say stuff like ‘Fascists shouldn’t be trusted with money’ - it’s a cool contextual voice system\n\nAlso you'll notice he never responded back with Heil H. and I liked that.\n\nI haven't heard one from doing that yet, but it is true that Indy will say all kinds of context sensitive one-liners. When I first stole some money, Indy said something like \"I should take this, you can't trust fascists with money\"\n\nSimilarly, \"It's never wrong to steal from a fascist.\"\n\n\"Can't trust fascista with money\"\n\nThat's another good one lol, I wonder how many Troy recorded. 20 hours into the game and now I'm just gonna wander around trying to get the voicelines to trigger.\n\nI had one yesterday where I knocked a guy out from behind with one punch, and indy said “real scrappy fella huh”\n\nPeople always forget that the beginning of ToD is some classic peak Indiana Jones.\n\nWhat is that?\n\nThe antidote.\n\nThe antidote to what?\n\nThe antidote to the poison you just drank!\n\nIt gets bogged down in the titular temple though.\n\nThe first 15 minutes is perfection in Temple of Doom without question.\n\nI find ToD is like a series of epic and iconic scenes ham fistedly strung together, rather than an all out epic film like Last Crusade and Raiders.\n\n Still great though.\n\nIt's funny really, because while it's probably the weakest overall film, it's also the one that actually contains the most of the stereotypical 'Indiana Jones' tropes. All the things that made people compare Indy and Lara Croft happen in the opening sequence of Raiders and the whole of ToD. It's a bit like how all the Bond stereotypes come from the Moore and the later Brosnan films, yet those are often also the least well-regarded.\n\nIf you were a kid when that movie released, it is the BEST entry in the series, if you take away the screaming.\n\nSame, Temple of Doom was the first one I saw, and as a kid, it was glorious, and still is. I don't get the hate for it at all. The original trilogy is fantastic, full stop.\n\nI loved it, as a kid, but holy shit was it fucked up. Watching a cult leader pull the hearts out of former child slaves that he originally kidnapped and enslaved for years. Then, while their heart was out of their chest and they were still alive and screaming, they were lowered into lava to be dissolved.\n\nFirst time I saw that movie I was pretty young. My dad used to always let me watch stuff a couple years early. The bug scene always stuck with me too because it was real bugs. That's the problem with the ants in the fourth movie. You can see they have a pattern to their movement and aren't moving correctly because they are too fast. You don't have the visceral reaction to it because you can tell it's not real.\n\nWatched all 3 this week. still incredibly fun movies.  Last Crusade was my favorite\n\nHoly fuck. That woman was so brutal. Indyyyyyyyyyyyyy\n\nTemple of doom is a great movie. Especially by today's standards.\n\nEspecially for a prequel.\n\nNo time for love, Doctor Jones!\n\nNot a super high bar but still an acceptable statement and opinion\n\nCompared to the newest Indiana Jones movie it's the best movie ever made\n\nTemple the worst?\n\nNice try Lao Che.\n\nRecently watched temple of doom again. Spent a while thinking Shortround wasn't that stereotypical, definitely not the *most* culturally sensitive writing but at least ok.\n\nThen we got to the scene with all the bugs and he says the floor is crunchy like fortune cookie. \n\nAll that to say, I also genuinely enjoy temple of doom, not sure why people hate it so much.\n\nClearly you’re confusing Indiana jones for Silent Bob in the cinematic masterpiece “Dogma”. It was a train though, not a blimp. People also tend to do this with the Clerks classic line “no time for love, Dr Jones”. It’s an understandable mistake!\n\nI once had the bar laughing at me during the finale of bar trivia when I buzzed in and said \"I'd fuck me\" was from Clerks 2.  I thought they were being esoteric.\n\nHonestly this game fucking NAILED Indy. Both the feel of the gameplay and the character of Indy himself, with the voice acting and mannerisms. \n\nBut one great example is that I've put like 10 hours into the game now, and have still yet to use a gun once. I've had a gun the whole time, and there's been plenty of situations where I could've used a gun, and that would've been perfectly fine, but Indy doesn't actually use guns very often. It's usually just punching guys, or sneaking up behind them and hitting them with something. And so that's all I've been doing, and its been fucking great \n\nPlus, they made the punch sound effects so satisfying, that that's all I ever wanna do.\n\nThey also put the player into the mindset of Indy, espscially when things go wrong and you're just doing things on the fly. When I get into trouble, or get caught stealing like in the OP pic, I'm looking for things around me to help me out, throwing shovels to stun guys, cracking the whip to get them to drop weapons, anything *except* pulling out a gun and going Rambo.\n\nI had one time where I chucked a bottle to stun a captain so he wouldn't blow the whistle alerting everyone, picked up a broom to beat down another fascist, and then proceeded to fistfight the captain and then drag both their bodies into a room to hide them. All in a blind panic.\n\nDude, they can catch shit, too. Threw a bottle, bad guy caught it.  I was standing there like I dropped my spaghetti.\n\nI had a funny moment where there was a bad guy up on a scaffolding and he and I just kept throwing the same club back and forth at each other for like five minutes before I finally got fed up and blasted him with my revolver.\n\nBro really became a Zelda boss\n\nHarder for them to catch a whole ass guitar haha\n\nYou get chase sequences emerging too. Do something stupid and get caught with like a dozen thugs around you? Uh oh, I'm outta here, and then you're running through the backstreets throwing stuff behind you looking for a place to hide.\n\nI agree that the way they implemented the revolver is great. Especially because I *have* used it, and for the most Indy thing possible - shooting a big bruiser bastard because I didn't want to deal with him in hand-to-hand!\n\n[Indiana Jones Direct Murders](https://youtu.be/YiDDBjnY6cI)\n\nIt feels bang on, yeah.  \nI was hopeful, but I'm actually really enjoying it, even more than I'd hoped.  \n\nFeels a little Thief-y, a little Hit Man-y, and absolutely gets Indy spot on.\n\nMess with the Jones, you get the bones.\n\nScrew with the Ford, prepare to get floored\n\nMess with Harrison, and it'll get hairy, son.\n\nMess with indy, it's gonna get windy! 🍑💨\n\nMess with Hank, get spanked \n\nScrew with the Junior, and he’ll end your tenure.\n\nMess with the Henry, you'll get a bent knee\n\nMess with Indiana and everyone looks like they slipped on a banana.\n\nMess with the Professor and get the aggressor\n\nMess with this dude, you get treated rude.\n\nMess with the guy named after the dog, you’ll get what happens when lightning strikes a frog *Halle Berry nods*\n\nSponsored by Jones Jones and Jones\n\nYou call him Dr. Jones, Doll.\n\n[removed]\n\nI am addicted to punching Nazis\n\nYou picked up the medicine vial on the table inside that tent, didn't you?\n\nYeah, I had a similar experience.\n\nI did that a few times trying to be sneaky. Then I went and threw a bottle behind the guard booth to get that guy out of the way and THAT time someone came from the other direction and I just said \"ok, fine\" and ended with a similar result as OP.\n\nYou can grab it and then flee to the far end of the courtyard, whip-climb up onto the scaffolding and hide there. Worked for me at least.\n\nIt's what I did, I only had to kill one soldier at the top of the scaffolding.\n\nThat's such a noob trap. I waited until everyone left the tent but there's actually one more sneaky mf peeking out from the booth across the road staring directly at me.\n\nI got the vial without him being an issue, but the 2 stacks of cash did me in.\n\nYep the two cash stacks also did me in. I even tried standing on the table behind the curtain but that didn't work like it would in Skyrim lmao.\n\nRite of passage\n\nGame should be called \"Indiana Jones: What Am I Going To Hit a Fascist With Next\".\n\nWe finally have a Nazi punching simulator and it’s glorious\n\nMakes sense since the previous games this studio made were the Wolfenstein series. They fucking rule\n\nWolfenstein New Order was a truly cathartic experience. Same with New Colossus. Such excellent games.\n\nWhen the second game quickly escalated to a nazi space base in like 20 seconds is so great and crazy. And that's not even the craziest thing in that level, what follows like 2 minutes later is one of the nuttiest things I've ever seen in game. It's so great.\n\n\"*I'm from Arizona*\"\n\nThis is how I feel about my first time playing through the first Blood Dragon. It got more and more absurd until the last mission is riding a trex with laser beams\n\nIf you read the description for the mini gun in that game, it says the manufacturer kept improving it by upping it's fire rate, until it was p much firing an unbroken laser of metal from the gun to the target, and they had to start looking into other ways of improving it, like power and accuracy lol\n\nAnd you sold me on the game. Those games are so fucking good.\n\nBJ and Indy would have so much fun slaughtering Nazis together\n\nSpecially after Indy sees what they’ve done with the ancient Jewish tech\n\nIT BELONGS IN A MUSEUM!\n\nThe most based game dev\n\nNot just the Nazis, you get to punch Mussolini's Blackshirts too. These fists don't discriminate what kind of fascist is on the receiving end\n\nI’m pretty sure you also get to fight the Imperial Japanese, so Indy’s just taking on the whole Axis Powers at this point lol\n\nThis wasn’t on my radar, but now it’s on my wishlist.\n\nKilled a Nazi with a toilet scrubber because I thought it'd be funny. It was, until I realized there was a toilet plunger around the corner and was bummed because that would've been even funnier.\n\nI am so glad I am not the only one who goes into a room carrying a led pipe only to come out carrying a guitar and giggling to myself. This game would be impossible if more realistic as the fascists would hear me sneaking up on them due to all the snickering and me trying to hold in my laughter, as I'm about to ring some guys bell with a literal bell.\n\nI love there's an achievement for taking out a Nazi with a guitar.\n\nAnd one for taking one out with a fly swatter.\n\nHahahah I feel this so hard. Two Nazis lined up on a ledge and I ran up to push them both off with absolutely no stealth and giggling in real life. lol. Killing a Nazi in the most goofy way possible brings me pleasure. They don't deserve an honorable death. \n\nI missed the opportunity to get someone with a violin and I was so sad. 😆\n\n[removed]\n\nI like beating them with a violin or a lute. Raiders of the honkytonk man\n\nYou do get an achievement for bashing a fascist with a guitar after all.\n\nis it called \"El Kabong\" by any chance?\n\nIt's probably a reference to this \n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists\n\nEvery single musical instrument I find I pick up and find someone to smack in the head with.\n\nFlyswatter!\n\nGot an achievement with that!\n\nAbsolutely whanging some cunt in the head with a shovel does not get old.\n\nPunching Simulator: Indiana Jones Edition ^(Now on GamePass)\n\nI wasn't interested in the game until this comment\n\n[Nobody will notice, if there's nobody to notice](https://i.redd.it/xxwbec5nc41y.png)\n\nI attempted a \"no witnesses because everyone's dead\" run on so many Hitman: Blood Money levels. Actually, I was always going for \"no witnesses and no bodies\" because that's a possibility on some levels. \n\nBut every time, I'd reach the point where almost everyone was dead (the civilian AI was actually pretty good at having a last man standing hiding from me), and dragging all the bodies to places where I could make them fully disappear made me ask myself, \"this is deranged, why am I doing this?\"\n\nI remember I once tried to liberate every single base and town in Just Cause 3 without ever being seen by the red guys.   \n  \n1.) it's difficult to tell because doing anything against the rule will automatically warn you of being wanted even if there's nobody actually around (and so the wanted immediately ends when the warning is done). Like, I climb into an empty enemy vehicle, and immediately gain a star and panic for a moment before realising the nearest enemy squad is halfway across the province.  \n2.) NPCs reacting to violent actions is based on your distance from them, not the thing they're supposedly reacting to. Punch somebody and every civilian nearby scatters, snipe someone on the street from a mountain and the person standing next to them doesn't care because Rico (PC) is too far away for the second person to detect him.\n\nGoes without saying, but I quit short pretty early on because it's basically impossible to never get noticed without abusing that detection range tactic. It's essentially just the regular game but you're camping on a hillside or helicopter with a LR-scope gun for every single raid.\n\n&gt; \"this is deranged, why am I doing this?\"\n\nIt's just a question of if it's fun or not. To me, it sound tedious, but I also found it really fun doing a pacifist run of _Deux Ex: Human Revolultion_ where I also rescued Malik. I found replaying that scene over and over sort like trying to solve a puzzle.\n\nA super advanced stealth technique.\n\nUnless I am wrong I'm pretty sure those weren't nazis but Italian fascists under Mussolini (aka Blackshirts)... not that there is much difference\n\nItalian fascists are just nazis with more colorful hand gestures.\n\nEdit: Yes, I know Italian fascists aren't just nazis with more colorful hands gestures, and that Italian fascism predated the German nazis.  That, and Italians have pizza.\n\nTechnically, Italian fascism predates the Nazis\n\nSo Nazis are really German *fascisti* who keep their hands weirdly still\n\nMarried a New York Italian. Can confirm, they do things with their hands.\n\nUnzips fly…..tell me more.\n\n🤌🤌\n\nHow dare you say that to me 🤌🤌\n\nYou talking to me? 🤌🏻🤌🏻\n\nFascists are fascists. They all deserve the same fate.\n\n\"Fuck it, it's time to go LOUD.\"\n\n\n-Indiana Jones, portrayed by myself.\n\nAs someone who consistently fails at Stealthing, I can agree.\n\nHaha I had the same thing happen in that spot, I took something from inside that tent and it was the first time for me seeing that you can steal. I got swarmed and dealt with it. \n\nI expected the whole place to remain hostile and was pretty gutted but nope. Everything was back to normal, it’s just a few bodies on the ground that’s all. 😅\n\nI've noticed that as long as it doesn't say steal, you can take it. If it says steal, you're likely in someone's line of sight and if you wait, the steal option will go away and you can just take it.\n\nThere's white lines around the prompt to take the money/medicine when you're in the clear, and red when you're not.\n\nSame for me.  I wouldn't be surprised if it was an intentional placement in the first big area to communicate this mechanic.\n\nI did the same - couldn't see that fascist hiding across the way in the booth. I just reloaded the prior checkpoint rather than playing Punch Out with them...\n\nDon't fuck with Father Gallagher.\n\n\"I love America! Do confession for me.\"\n\nBoy did that guy ever screw up lol\n\nAs that guy was confessing I immediately wanted to punch him in the face through the screen. I was so happy when Indy did exactly that.\n\nThose are technically Fascists. That said, these fists are rated “E”\n\nRated \"E\" for *extremely violent*\n\nAnd as afar as they know some random ass Irish priest from Boston did it lol\n\nIt's Father Gallagher, doll.\n\nThe confession scene lmao\n\nJesus Christ!\n\nHe kind of deserved it.\n\n\"Jesus christ, what did you do?\"\n\n\"You're not a priest!!\"\n\nPUNCH\n\nThe writers fucking nailed Indiana Jones.\n\n*\"Father\"* Gallagher.\n\nNot to be *that* guy, but those are Italian fascists, not Nazis. \n\nSame but different, I guess.\n\nBut have you found the Jaw bone of an ass in the Vatican yet? The beating it throws is absolutely BIBLICAL!\n\nIt's always bash a Nazi day\n\nAnd boy are my arms tired\n\nThe great circle is the number of survivors you left behind.\n\nI thought it was italians in that game?\n\n&gt;!nazis show up at the end of the Vatican City chapter!&lt;\n\n*they* belong in a museum.\n\nG.I. Robot would be proud.\n\nThey deserved it, TBH.\n\nEspecially the one solider with his wife and mother in law iykyk\n\n[deleted]\n\nThis part of the game is in The Vatican. They are Italian fascists, not Nazis. The Nazis come later.\n\n[deleted]\n\nAgreed\n\nIs this game any good? Seen a lot of promotions recently seemed pretty hyped\n\nThis would be my GOTY if Tekken 8 didn't release this year.\n\nYeah trying to properly do the stealth stuff because you can't be bothered to have to knock out another 20 guys\n\nthe women and children too?\n\nIf only /s\n\nI know exactly what you were trying to steal and where, lmao\n\nI bet next time, they will pretend to Nazi a thing\n\nNazis, nazi zombies, all of it feels great to decimate in any game\n\nLooks like fists really are mightier than the whip this time!\n\nThose aren’t Nazis chief.

There is literally no way to take it “stealthily” and apparently a man in a Blackshirt uniform in a Blackshirt tent taking a medicine bottle from Blackshirt inventory is grounds for the entire fucking plaza to try to beat you to death.

Is this real life?\n\n\"Instead, you will have to launch it...THRICE!!!\"\n\nLaunching Civ 7 from Steam will launch the Epic launcher which will launch Uplay which will launch the EA app which will launch battlenet which will launch Steam again which will launch the Rockstar launcher which will launch the Xbox app which will launch the Paradox launcher which will launch the Riot launcher which will launch the Playstation launcher which will launch the Bethesda net launcher which will finally launch the game.

I got a bunch of those controllers free, so not only did Google refund the couple of games I'd bought, they also gave me full refunds for every controller I had \"bought\", even though they had been sending them out for nothing.\n\nI just recently picked up a few of them since they are cheap and decent controllers for whatever I might need.\n\nI just assumed they'd been bricked by Google, didn't even think to check if they still worked! I'll need to dig a few out!\n\nThey have a firmware update to turn it into a Bluetooth controller. It's a decent controller if you can get one cheap.\n\nI bought 2 of the last of the Steam Controllers ever for 5 bucks a piece when they were on close out.\n\nGlad I did. They are unique ass controllers.\n\nI love my steam controller, but it has seen better days. Left bumper haptics are broken (still activates the button, just doesn't 'click') and the left analog stick has lost half its coating and the bottom left corner of the stick 'border' is broken so it falls into that spot if it move it to the bottom left.  It's still amazing and I love the customizations and the full-pull trigger buttons.  Hell, I used it to play Elite Dangerous without any other input devices for hundreds of hours.  It had a lot of button combinations ('chords' as steam calls them) but it worked incredibly well and the track pads came in handy.\n\n[deleted]\n\nSure am.\n\nHoly hell!\n\nYou can't.

And the people did feast upon the lambs, and sloths, and carp, and anchovies, and orangutans, and breakfast cereals, and fruit bats, and large-chulapas...\n\nAnd then add an option that says \"I did want to launch the game but the time I had to play has run out now\".\n\n\"And so did my patience, now I need to relax even more.\"\n\nBuy on Steam, it opens an EA Launcher, clicking that opens UPlay, clicking there opens whatever the fuck a 2K launcher is, open Civ opens the game, screen fades in, you are riding in a horse drawn cart.....\n\n\"Hey you!

EA for example fuck them.\n\nMan fucking dragon age: inquisition is the worst. You launch through steam which launches the stupid EA launcher, but if you want to mod it you need another launcher which launches the game through steam which launches the EA launcher which *maybe* launches the game if it's feeling generous. If you want to mod you're better off pirating the game honestly\n\nI'm not big into sports games but recently my mates have been playing some and want me to join. The problem is, I haven't played an EA game in so long that the account I had was tied to an email address that I don't have, no longer have access to because it doesn't exist. It won't let me create a new one. So in summary, I had the same gamertag but a different email tied to it then I registered an EA account with and the last time I needed to log into an EA account was over 10 years ago.\n\nEA is learning too-- the next Dragon Age will be Steam native, no client needed.\n\nI straight up won't play Ubisoft games because of this. Even the offline games require an account.\n\nEA next please. I'd like to play mass effect again.\n\nEA? Good luck. You're talking about a back to back winner of the worst company in America award. Think about that for a second, all of the scumbag companies in America and EA somehow managed to go back to back. A lot of companies do some pretty horrible shit but EA is so scummy in their video game practices that people overlooked all of the other companies shit 2 years in a row.\n\nHonestly they should have been broken up years ago. They control way too much of the market, especially sports games.\n\n&gt; You're talking about a back to back winner of the worst company in America award.\n\nYes, when you ask a bunch of gamers to answer that question, they're going to pick a game company.  Meanwhile, trains derailing, airplanes suffering major malfunctions, astronauts stranded in space, toxic waste getting dumped, workers pissing in bottles...  but, EA released another shitty game this year, so they're obviously the worsssst.\n\nDragon age the veil guard won’t require EA app. So there’s a plus. \n\nBut I doubt EA will go back and retroactively disconnect their older games from the service.\n\nDead Space Remake also doesn't have it, i think Immortals of Aveum is Steam Native too but i can't confirm.\n\nAs for your last comment on EA retroactively patching out their launcher it's not impossible, they just did it with It Takes Two, here's hoping they will also do it on Jedi Survivor on it's upcoming patch\n\nEA App sucks ass, worst part is your game license is tied to your EA Account not Steam which makes it incompatible with Steam Family Sharing (everyone in your household has to pay their own copy to play a singleplayer game yay DRM!)\n\nEven EA App itself knows it's bad, it literally uninstalls itself in the background everytime it auto updates, already happened to me 3 times, didn't even bother to reinstall it the last time it did that.\n\nI've stopped buying games with launchers, but now they're even being added in years later. I can't escape them\n\nIt is very common these days. They need to get every KB of your data to maximize profit.\n\nI was pretty pissed when gog suddenly and without warning did that. The whole goddamned point of gog is to download old games and not have to have an internet connection to play them.\n\nthey probably realized they dont need a launcher because they can just put ads in the game.\n\n\"you move your scout one tile into the fog. youre settlers following one tile behind. anxiously you move the scouts one more tile, up the hill, hoping no barbarians are nearby so you can found a new city on the optimal tile.\"\n\n\"You've discovered Egypt!\"\n\n\"Hello, I am Cleopatra. Its a pleasure to meet you. Lets discuss a trade. I will give you Ivory if you pReOrDeR gRaNd ThEfT aUtO 6!\"\n\nI was expecting the fog to disappear and reveal an ad but this one was good.\n\nWelp, never should had it to begin with.\n\n&gt; instead of making it more tedious and packed with ads\n\nFor Civ6 they moved the ads right into the main menu. a nice big box near the middle of the menu screen.\n\nAren’t those just ads about dlc though? That doesn’t feel all that invasive. Ads about other games or completely separate accessories is where it starts to irk me.\n\nYou’ll still have to make an account with them\n\nYou're telling me they actually did something that makes sense?\n\n\nNah, no way. I suspect shenanigans.\n\nCause it’s ineffective. No one looks at those ads for more than a couple of seconds. \n\nNow they will be effective. You’ll have constant ads thru out the game on a banner across the bottom of the screen. Like those news scrolling by.\n\nAlexander the Great discovers Nike \n\n+2 gold \n\n*Save 15% on shoes at this link*\n\n*If you build a factory on a different continent and the overall state of scientific development of that continent is lower than on Nike's continent, the factory upkeep is -4 gold.*\n\n**Can we try to get other companies to do this?** Please.\n \n***Pretty please***!??  \n \nIt would make gaming so much more enjoyable instead of launching a game twice.\n\ncan they do this for XCOM2 and all older games as well?   Their launcher has been a plague for so long.\n\nYou can disable the launcher in steam with a small addition to the file path or soemthing.  Google has the answer, my friends walked me through it.  We had to disable the launcher to get multiplayer to work after one of the big patches\n\nYeah, I've done that, I just want them to formally remove it.  the \"every company has its own launcher\" stuff is incredibly irritating. :)\n\nThis is the reason I mainly buy anything from GOG anymore, that way I don't have to deal with all the unnecessary stuff.\n\nThe \"you can easily bypass this that didn't even need to be an issue in the first place\" is also annoying.\n\nI forgot how to do that, but I did it in the past because the launcher was bugged and wasn't letting me launch the game. I remember you could do something similar to launch Crysis and skip the origin launcher too.\n\nGet the alternative launcher for xcom 2. It's faster and way better for manging mods. I got so tired of their tedious launcher trying to find the conflict and it helped immensely\n\n[removed]\n\nprobably to add something even more pointless\n\nYa, apparently it's a 2k account lmao. Goodbye playing civ online lol\n\nIs a 2K account really a deal breaker? Seems silly.\n\nGod discord has melted people's brains.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAn account is a no go. It's why I am stuck here, because you do not need an account to access Reddit.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBelieve or not, Quora would be as famous as Yahoo answer if not for their account requirements.\n\nQuora would absolutely have been so much more popular if that requirement didn’t exist. It’s so tedious to make an account for things that aren’t necessary.\n\ni feel Quora is more famous than yahoo answer\n\nI think that was the joke\n\nBut… You have a Reddit account… You need a Reddit account to comment.\n\nGenuinely asking: What's discord got to do with anything you mentioned?\n\nJust for multiplayer. Who the hell plays turn-based 4X games against other people anyway?\n\nPlaying civ 6 with a group of friends is actually fucking hilarious and the best way to play. Especially with the ability to do custom religions.\n\nI mean... I don't but it's not that different from people playing chess or board games together, online or offline. \n\n\nIt's funny because I watched a YouTube of an online Civ 6 streamer playing against offline Civ 6 streamers and the meta is so different that he stomped all over them.\n\n&gt; It's funny because I watched a YouTube of an online Civ 6 streamer playing against offline Civ 6 streamers and the meta is so different that he stomped all over them.\n\nIf you got a link to that I'd like to watch it, thanks!\n\nhttps://youtu.be/ELxisCLDQAc \n\n\nThis took way too long to find but I hope you enjoy!\n\nthe Civ 6 AI is just bad at the game.\n\nBut the game doesn't even do what you click; like when moving a unit it shows a path the unit will allegedly take in the current turn; but often the unit just goes a different longer way, or moves next to an enemy unit for no reason.\n\nWell in Civ 5 the game would stop the unit and make you re-move them. In Civ 6 they repath for you no matter how illogical.\n\nI played for months on a dedicated Civ 6 online multiplayer discord; The connection issues where terrible, but going against real people is trilling!\n\nMy friends and I play games like Civ and Stellaris together all the time\n\nOh it wasn't pointless. It collected your data\n\nExcept, this time you will need 2k account\n\nFor multiplayer. You can play without one if you're only interested in single player.\n\nWait, is this for real? Where have you read this?\n\n[Confirmed](https://forums.civfanatics.com/threads/civ-vii-requires-3rd-party-account-2k-account.691270/post-16649186) by the community manager. The steam page also says that.\n\nThat's a relief.  I thought they were going to pull a SimCity on us.\n\n\"Simcity is meant to be played online, and if you can't get a good connection you won't have a good time.\" Quote paraphrased from memory. For a game that 99% of the player base plays solo.\n\nMore like \"game is made with connection to our servers in mind. It's impossible to separate\" they say a month before separating it from the servers.\n\nDidn't some modders already get it working offline by the time of that comment.\n\nThat should have awoken people to PR lies, but it didn't. It has only gotten worse since.\n\nGood, I was pretty angry at that bullshit, so this is great news. Thanks!!\n\nthe community manage as early as 3 days before Arena breakouts launch lied about the game not having certain monetization streams. Game launched with those exact revenue streams they said they wouldn't have. So lie until the early launch window then shoehorn in some P2W. They know what they're doing these days. They've seen how effective a straight lie can be. The whole world has.\n\nIs this on just PC or console as well? Because console lets you use your PSN/Xbox Live account for online multiplayer in 6\n\nIt's for crossplay. PC can play with consoles with a 2K account.\n\nAw, shit. Pack it in. Let's try again next announcement\n\nHow it works I wonder, do you login ingame?\n\nOnly for multiplayer which is no different than civ 6. If you didn't log in you can't agree to the terms and conditions for multiplayer play. If you don't joining a multiplayer game just fails without a helpful error.\n\nIs that what that’s for? I’ve never logged in, and when that pops up I always hit disagree to all. It’s never stopped me from playing multiplayer though.\n\nPeople who played the first few wow games had to type their password manually multiple times a day and lived with it\n\nYou'd think we would have advanced a bit in 20 years tho\n\nFinal fantasy XIV still makes you do that to this day.\n\nUnless you use an unofficial third party launcher to do it, that is.\n\nHaving an account that you create on their website and just log on for multiplayer isn't the end of the world.\n\nI don’t want a launcher, I wanna be able to click on the.exe and play the game\n\nI mean... you can...\n\nYep, this is how I play Stellaris. Runs 100x faster\n\nYou mean launch faster or in game performance is actually better?\n\nIn game performance. (At least in Steam). Especially late game. Also loads much faster. Ymmv though, it just seems the launcher/steam overlay bog it down quite a bit.\n\nTypically shortcuts created from Steam run the game via Steam, the same as if launched from the Steam app; and the game's exe also runs Steam in the background before the game (since the game is linked to Steam's dlls for DRM and other Steam functions like the overlay). So it's odd if anything really differs, though I guess in theory some games might skip launching Steam themselves.\n\nThe more straightforward way to fiddle with performance would be to disable the overlay in Steam's settings for the game.\n\nP.S. [Another commenter has said](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1eul176/2k_removes_its_pointless_launcher_from/linryly/) that games can opt in or out of integration with Steam, and many just run the bare game through the executable. However, I don't see how the DRM would function that way, and I don't think it's optional on Steam.\n\nReally? The game actually runs faster? How do you set this up?\n\n[deleted]\n\nTurn on single click launch and double your productivity!\n\nYou can set these games up so that the Steam shortcut directly calls the exe file. I can't remember the last time I saw a Larian or 2k or paradox launcher.\n\nI think that those days are gone.\n\nIsn't that basically how GOG works?\n\nYes. That's the whole idea about DRM-free. Although in some cases you'll still need something to play multiplayer (like GOG Galaxy for example).\n\nLike 99% of steam games dont require the launcher, steam just launches the exe for you but you cna easily go into file explorer and do it yourself.\n\nAnd a lot of the games that start with a launcher (say, Hitman or Arkham games) you can by pass it by configuring steam to either tell the launcher to just skip itself, or by setting the executable to the thing the launcher would launch anyway.\n\nMost games don't have a launcher\n\nSteam is a launcher.\n\nDo you guys not have them shortcut things that run each game? No need to open Steam, though it has to run in the background.\n\nNow do xcom 2\n\nI would pay money to have it removed. Its such ass and makes modding more complicated for no reason\n\nYou should get the Alternative Mod Launcher (AML). It makes modding 100% easier\n\nDon't give them ideas. People already pay to play YouTube videos in the background.\n\nGood, launchers shouldn't be allowed on steam at all.\n\nDepends if it is a legacy game or Medieval II for example. It run mods better with the launcher.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe issue is that these aren't game launchers anymore, they are company launchers that want access to you since they can't get you to use their stores.\n\nI can't get into civ 6 for some reason.  Civ 5 was so fun and addicting and simpler.\n\nDistricts are really engaging if you're in the mood to plan and min-max heavily, but off-putting if you just want to chill and play.\n\nIt just feels like Civ V is intuitive. Vox Populi mod isn't, but makes the game smart and lets you roleplay and enjoy yourself with rivals that feel real and trying to get you. It's a great game.\n\nI have over 1k hours in IV,V and VI. I love them all for different reasons. \n\nYep same here. IV is still the GOAT. But VI grew on me over years of playing. Its different but fun in its own unique way\n\nI hated the artwork in 6 compared to 5.\n\nCheck out the Environment Skin: Sid Meyer’s Civilization V on Steam. I prefer the gameplay of 6 but the graphics are not my favorite, this fixes that issue!\n\nI looked like fucking Clash Royale, I felt done dirty by it. I refused to play over 100 hours purely because of that.\n\nI think the problem is that Civ 6 has less warfare and less sudden exciting discoveries. \n\nCiv 5 for example, an ancient ruins might give you the first damned religion on the map or put you in the lead for rushing Great Library. Civ 6? Technically a lot of the same, but they scaled down how large the rewards are with only minor chances of getting something comparable to 5.\n\nOr just the policies in general. Certain policies were big in Civ 5 for resolving problems, but the policies in Civ 6 feel comparably really forgettable. Same with religious tenants and ideologies. The Civ 6 counterparts always just felt like \"number go up more\" and somehow didn't have the same charm for me. \n\nAny time I've tried getting into Civ 6, I just feel like I'm doing nothing but managing my cities in a way that isn't even blatantly clear if I'm doing it significantly better than my competition is. In Civ 5, you'll know if you're behind because fucking Shaka Zulu is knocking on your door; they'll leave you behind if you're ahead.\n\n**EDIT:** To expand on this I bit, I think what Civ 5 got right is that a lot of the unlocks were like \"hey, you like focusing markets and economic buildings, but hate how you're not finding time to build happiness? Well this unlock makes it so those exact buildings provide happiness too!\" By contrast, Civ 6 feels like very specific setups in order to make \"number go up\" more, and it feels comparatively rare that a policy, tenant or ideology changes ***how*** the numbers are earned. Civ 5 feels like you focus on ***how*** to make number go up, whereas Civ 6 feels like you only focus on making number go up more and more. The strategy feels more apparent and less situational in 5.\n\nfertility rites goes brrrrr\n\nA lot of holdouts don't care for the district system.\n\nThe three things that made me drop 6 and go back to 4 and 5 were districts, expendable workers, and inability to build roads the way I want to.\n\nEvery time I tried to give 6 a chance, I would get the urge to play a better 4X instead.\n\nI love 4 and 5, but I strongly disagree with them being better 4X. They're great at making you feel like you're exploring and building a civilization and the game feels kinda centered around the player which is a great solo experience. 6 is however, and in my opinion, far better at being a multiplayer game. I've always tried playing civ with friends and only really had fun playing 6. At its best it really feels like a board game.\n\nIt was the same thing for me. Loved Civ 5 so picked up 6 on sale but just didn’t enjoy it the same\n\nOh and btw, you’ll also need a 2K account now!\n\nFor multiplayer only.\n\nWell, 3600 hours in and never played multiplayer so I’m good lol, I’m an introvert with gaming lol\n\nAs a software developer you have to do something like this to support every place its bought from... Instead of integrating with each seperate platform you bought it from you have one centralize account for tracking your progress.. People complaining about this are actually stupid and don't know anything about software problems.\n\nXCom 2 and Midnight Suns just gonna sit with the shit launcher forever then 2K?\n\nThank fuck there's a loophole with Steam.\n\nDo they still have that questionable ToS for Civ 6 where they collect all your data or did they get rid of that too?\n\nI've been replaying the Bioshock trilogy and it's such a pointless bs app.\n\nThey also just dropped the ads in the Civ V launcher.  Which hadn't changed in years.\n\nThats cool can they do this with all of their games\n\nI hope this extends to Xcom 2 too. You can bypass with a shortcut but I can’t count the amount of times I’ve tried to boot it through steam.\n\nGood - now go the fuck back and repeat the process for Bioshock.\n\nCIV III is still king\n\nGood, now remove it from XCOM Chimera Squad.\n\nAround a year ago I started using the executable directly to avoid the launcher, but some upgrade reverted things to \"normal\".\n\nCan someone explain it to me like I'm 5 exactly what's so terrible about this launcher or launchers in general and why it being removed is a good thing? I'm genuinely confused\n\nMost of the time when launchers exist for a game, they only serve the purpose of advertising the newest game by the company, a dlc, or to get you to sign up for their launcher so they can try and pull and ubiConnect or origin down the line. \n\nIts not usually a big hindrance, but its still a time waster and extra source of bugs, which is what irks most people. \n\nThe only good launcher i can think of is the paradox launcher. I know some of the playerbase dislikes it, but it serves an actual purpose in helping me sort through my mods easily and is usually bug free. CD projek red's on the other hand is completely useless. I made an account to play CB77 initially and never used it again, and last i checked it just advertises the phantom liberty dlc\n\nThey offer zero benefits to the user and add friction to starting a game. I'm not gonna return a game for having a launcher, but I am gonna be annoyed. \n\nI'll often hit play on Steam and then go grab a drink while the game launches, but if there's a launcher I forgot about, I come back to the launcher instead of a ready-to-play game. Is it a big deal? No. Is it better to not have one? Yes.\n\nHaving less companies collecting your data waiting to inevitably be hacked is better. Also they are pointless resource hogs, especially on low end machines.\n\nNow they have to remove the 2k launcher from the bioshock games\n\nDid they also remove it from Bioshock? I don't want to resort to piracy for the games I own.\n\nI'm going to buy this game just because they did this. I feel so heard.\n\nIt's incredible how much difference it made for load time.\n\nOh no! But the 2K launcher adds so much value to the experience!\n\nDid 2K remove the annoying as hell launchers from the Mafia games as well, especially number 2 and 3 who retrospectively were added the annoying launcher?\n\nNice gesture leading up to the big Civ 7 reveal on Monday.  I'm so excited to find out how i'm going to be spending thousands of hours of my life over the next few years."

This would make a cool poster.\n\nYou sell prints?\n\nYou always do an awesome job on these!\n\nUpvoted this, because I was about to comment “No, you didn’t.” \n\nGlad it’s not a repost. \n\n@OP : nice work.\n\nlol funny enough that's exactly what I said out loud.\n\nI assumed this was a reposting shill too lol. Cheers OP!\n\nthanks! for some reason though there's a bunch of repost bots in here copying responses from the SNES\n\nThis had been around long enough that somebody would *definitely* try to pass it off as their own thing. So glad to see op is legit!\n\nI have your N64 and PlayStation work hanging on my wall in my office. I work in the gaming industry and your work received several compliments during the WFH days of the pandemic since they were the backdrop of my webcam view.  \n\nBig fan!\n\nFirst place my mind went too.\n\nI have the PS1 &amp; PS2 prints on my wall :)\n\nUsed to have the gamecube one as my phone wallpaper for awhile\n\nOMG same. I was entirely ready to go off in the comments!\n\nSometimes I forget Zelda and Metroid are from the same generation as Duck Hunt. Beautiful!\n\nso many franchises started on this thing that are still going strong, been really fun to see them evolve\n\nI see the TMNT underwater level and get PTSD.\n\nBattletoads hoverbike level \n\nLove the inclusion of Snake, Rattle and Roll. Under rated deep cut right there.\n\nthat's one of my favorites!\n\nIt had great sound design.\n\nOnly one I couldn't figure out, don't think I ever played that one.\n\nIt's a fun game. A lot of people don't like it because they don't like isometric controls, but if you play it with a decent quality d-pad, it's a lot of fun.\n\nAh thank you! I was trying to remember the name of that one. Super fun game.\n\nThat game was so friggin' difficult! I did end up beating it a few times (s*nakes in space!*), but it made Battletoads feel easy by comparison.\n\n[removed]\n\n[removed]\n\nTop to bottom:\nExcitebike\nTetris\nCastlevania \nMetroid\nSnake Rattle n’ Roll\nKirby’s Adventure\nMario 3\nNinja Gaiden\nDuck Hunt\nMetal Gear\nMario 2\nBattletoads\nMike Tyson’s Punch-out\nMega Man 3\nThe Legend of Zelda\nFinal Fantasy\nContra\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\nTecmo Bowl\nGhost N’ Goblins\n\nDon't forget Marble Madness!\n\nThat was such an amazing game, but tough as nails.\n\nThanks for that, one of my all time faves\n\nTop to bottom:  \nExcitebike  \nTetris  \nCastlevania  \nMetroid  \nSnake Rattle n’ Roll  \nKirby’s Adventure  \nMario 3  \nNinja Gaiden  \nDuck Hunt  \nMetal Gear  \nMario 2  \nBattletoads  \nMike Tyson’s Punch-out  \nMega Man 3  \nThe Legend of Zelda  \nFinal Fantasy  \nContra  \nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles  \nTecmo Bowl  \nGhost N’ Goblins  \n\n\nFixed.  You need to type two spaces after a line to add a line break.  You can put a blank line between two lines for a paragraph break.  Another thing is if you put `- ` (dash space) before each line it'll make a bullet point list.\n\nMarble madness behind ghost n goblins\n\nI love how many of us saw this and were prepared to go to war with OP if it wasn't their art. Internet artists need more folks looking out for them.\n\nyall the real MVPs\n\nYea I did it\n\nThat’s pretty cool\n\nThat's awesome. And you've already done a whole series of these images? Very cool.\n\nthanks!\n\nThe ninja turtle was a nice hit of nostalgia. Also fuck that level\n\nAgreed. Hardest part of the entire game.\n\nI've never gotten past that level. It haunts me still!\n\nPlease let us know if you sell those prints. That is absolutely incredible.🤩😮‍💨🔥\n\nYes I would absolutely put this on my wall\n\nI too would buy. This is amazing work.\n\nTMNT part is ptsd inducing\n\nLove that you included Marble Madness!\n\nThe Excitebike kicked me right in the nostalgia.  :)\n\nSnake rattl n roll. Love it. \n\nI saw your PlayStation ones a while back. I absolutely love your work. Pure talent and creativity!\n\nthanks!\n\nA nice mix of happy childhood memories and trauma like the underwater TMNT level and getting laughed at by the Duck Hunt dog.\n\nNew Phone Wallpaper\n\nthis is incredible\n\nI popped for Snake Rattle n Roll and Marble Madness\n\nThis is the single most nostalgic piece of video game art I’ve ever seen. Idk what but it’s makin’ me feel things 🥺\n\nIncredible.  Making the TMNT water level just a small window at the bottom is so perfect, it simulates the same sense of claustrophobia. 10/10 for trauma.\n\nMater blaster and Bionic Commando are missing but you got definitely most of the heavy nostalgia points for me. Ooh… and where’s Rygar? Love the work!\n\nWelp, just bought one of every console.  Well done.\n\nHow come you stopped posting your stuff on r/WimmelBilder??\n\nLove your work! Was checking your prints and noticed a console missing.. Sega Genesis.  Is that one possibly in the pipeline?\n\ndefinitely planning for genesis in the future yeah\n\nReminds me of Richard Parry's photography https://www.richardparrydesign.com/\n\nThat dirt biker will never walk again\n\nHoly moly! Snake, Rattle n Roll and Marble Madness.  I was convinced that I was the only chump who played these games\n\nI'm a little older and this one has actually made me feel some feels. A large part of my happiest memories exist in this image and the things that were happening at the time. Thank you for this\n\nThat is pretty cool\n\nOMG that’s AMAZING\n\nThis is so good! Thank you so much for sharing.\n\nHey! I’ve seen your Gamecube one too! Brilliant work!\n\nThat's so fucking awesome!\n\n# now you're playing with power\n\nOh god the TMNT swimming levels\n\nYou even got Snake Rattle N Roll in there! Absolutely amazing 🙌\n\nDude, fuck that dam level from TMNT. \n\nAmazing\n\nAmazing! This does something for me. \n\nThis is incredible - absolutely fantastic work\n\nThis is amazing!\n\nI absolutely love this. I wish I had more than one up vote to give.\n\nThats awesome\n\nReally really cool !\n\nFantastic!!!\n\nThat's mega kool\n\nThis is so awesome.\n\nAll your art with the exploded view consoles have been amazing!\n\nthanks!\n\nDang Snake Rattle &amp; Roll getting a shoutout with some real legends in there.\n\nDo you sell prints? I’d absolutely love to have the exploded consoles around my room!\n\nWow, nice one mate! This is honestly perfect :) Have you made one with other consoles/PC and such?\n\nMega man looks like a real man now with that goatee lol\n\nAwesome!\n\nI love your work reminds of the toys from the 90s, the ball that has a half clear dome and you could look into a small world.\n\nTruly amazing,keep up the work\n\nI have your exploded Xbox 360 in my living room. Your works are incredible, keep it up!\n\nMom's gonna be pissed if you don't put that back together\n\nThis is absolutely fantastic!! As someone born in the 80s I can appreciate everything about this.\n\nNailed it.\n\nWow, this is looking so good! Looks like something you would have found in club nintendo magazine back in the 90s. I feel so nostalgic looking at your picture.\n\nHahahaha I love these kinds of pictures, I have one on my wall of the gameboy pocket and it has the original 151 Pokemon hanging out.\n\nOh wow I’m so glad I came across this, your type of art is my fav. Can’t wait to see your PS5 view :3\n\nBeautiful work, great job!\n\nThat's awesome.\n\nMan, I miss the days when you would find the odd ‘exploded view’ in the old Popular Science magazines. Sometimes it would be a foldout, it was like Playboy for adolescent nerds.\n\nHoly shit I feel like I haven't seen your art in years, amazing as always!!\n\nThat Looks rly cool!!\n\nseeing these old nintendo games takes me back to a great memory.  one of THE best feelings in the world was getting your hands on the sears christmas catalog and circling all the toys and video games you're about to ask santa for.\n\nThis is awesome, great job!!\n\nThis is really cool. Q-Bert would be a nice added touch to this.\n\nThis is fucking sick!\n\nYou must be the same guy who did the SNES and the N64?\n\nThis is some proper dark magic to get all the fundamental NES games in one take. Thank you for actually having Mike and not Mr. Dream.\n\nHehe the one improvement I could see is incorporating Tecmo Bowl's [Bo Jackson as part of the football portion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X-MODwmZGQ).\n\nBut love everything about this, especially Luigi's old outfit.\n\nNice one! 👍\n\nWell now I know why whacking the side of the thing made it function.  Got all those lazy buggers inside back to work.\n\nSick!\n\nChildhood memories. But Battletoads I only played on SNES. It was a torture\n\nThat's lovely, I'm stealing this.\n\nSnake, Rattle, and Roll mentioned 🐍🐍 🐍\n\nThis is just fantastic.\n\nThis is really cool! Good job\n\nFollowing 🤙🏻 so dope\n\nAmazing work my friend.Thank you!\n\nWow! Beautiful \n\nnumerous sheet thumb society kiss alive weather frighten like juggle\n\nI remember your PS4 version of this, it was awesome! Just like this one!\n\nHad no idea there were tiny guys in my NES! Great art :)\n\nlove your art and have download some\n\nNo wonder I always had to blow of the cartridge.... look at the dust the Excitebike guys are kicking up.\n\nnow where's waldo?\n\nSimon on the stairs?\n\nTMNT in the water?\n\nBattletoads on the scooters?\n\nYou're a cruel man\n\nThis is awesome\n\nAhh man i really miss this days…\n\nSo cool. Well done\n\nThis is so great.  Honestly.  So great.\n\nI like how you improved on the concept of the parts by adding the scenes! Very creative!\n\nI love this for about a million reasons.\n\nIs this true isometric or does it have a slight perspective? I know isometric can sometimes look “wrong” when it gets tall like this. Looks great.\n\nthis is so fire\n\nDid you also draw a ps 2 exploded poster? If so that is what I had on my wall.\n\nI could see this being in a magazine advertising for the NES\n\nNailed it! This is exactly what is ina console\n\nThis is literally the coolest thing I've ever seen\n\nwhoa this is awesome\n\nI just want to say that I am ***so*** happy to see you're back to making these! Even if it's only temporary and you take an extended break again, I wanted to say how much I appreciate your work. I absolutely love your art style and the work/detail you put into these. You're such a talented artist!\n\n I own printed versions of all your other console exploded views and I'll definitely be buying this one as well!\n\nVery cool\n\nThat's basically my whole early-teenhood encapsulated in one drawing, right there.\n\nDang!\n\nThat damn electrified seaweed or whatever it was in tmnt water levels...frustrating memories unlocked.\n\nLove it!\n\nThat’s how my child brain used to be like before I got all sad and stuff.\n\nInstant anxiety seeing the underwater level in TMNT haha (RIP poor turtles, that level was rough). Awesome work!\n\nDo you have a full res version anywhere? I would love this as a poster\n\nSo that's what's going on in there\n\nthis really hits all the high points. the marble madness inclusion is clutch.\n\nYou did good OP.\n\nI'm biased, but your exploded view on Dreamcast is my favorite. Is there any chance you'd consider doing exploded views for console controllers? Would love to buy posters of these pairings\n\nThat's about what I thought was going on inside.\n\nIt’s beautiful\n\nLies. I've seen the inside, it's all gerbils.\n\nThese are so amazing I bought 3 (PS1, Dreamcast and Super Nintendo) all hanging in my game room.\n\nOP LOVE this so glad you’re getting the credit you deserve from fans of this artwork for years! And gotta say, love inclusion of TMNT dam AND Battletoads chasm level, the two hardest levels on that console in my opinion but so much fun when you get good at them! Such cool art, thanks again for making it! \n\nThat some intricate details in there cool.\n\nSo much nostalgia in one picture. I have to admit that my memory of playing NES feels more like this than actually playing it. Nintendo Hard is a real thing. It's like the games want to take my quarters when I already own it.\n\nYou drew this!?! That's fucking rad!!! I'd love a copy of this hanging in my office!\n\nBro how are you so good I suck😭\n\nThis is amazing! I love it.\n\nSuper creative. I saved it so I can zoom in and look at all the details later when I get the chance. Awesome work!\n\nFollowed on Insta, genuinely delightful work. The PS1 and SNES are my happy place\n\nThis is maybe the coolest thing I've seen\n\nI love this , and it’s so spot on. These are all the characters of my childhood.\n\nI haven’t thought about marble madness in a while! this is so cool\n\nDude! Snake, Rattle and Roll!\n\nDUUUUUUUDE, I am FUCKING DEAD.\n\nIm sure the ninja turtles are underneath haha right?\n\nRight????\n\nOh good.\n\nNostalgia is never the wrong formula. Put NES sprites in a bag of dog shit, I'll be happy.\n\nImpressive\n\nRip blue excitebike guy\n\nDUDE THIS IS AMAZING YES I’M SHOUTING BECAUSE IT IS THAT GOOD!\n\nMy stem class room has like five of these\n\nThis is the coolest thing I have ever seen.\n\nThis is really nice. You did an excellent job!\n\nWait, I have your SNES one on my wall! Great work 🔥🔥\n\nI need a remastered Excitebike\n\n*Edit - just saw the laughing dog and some long suppressed PTSD was triggered\n\nSnake Rattle n Roll! Rare shout out to a killer nes game\n\nThe fucking turtles dam swimming level\n\nThe music and the BZZZT live rent free in my nightmares\n\nThis is so cool!"

Maybe some D&amp;D and MtG tables thrown in for good measure 🧙‍♂️\n\nBro if im not slinging some cedh at the old folks home it's bc I'm already dead\n\nHallo, I edited some of my comment history to prevent scraping. Yes I know reddit gets regularly cached, it's something you sign in when you type on a forum, it's still better than nothing and will make digging through these a lot less convenient! All platforms die yadda yadda.\n\nGood luck if you have an account here and you're reading this.\n\nI don't have 30k laying around to start a vintage deck\n\nI’m sorry, I’m confused. What exactly did you think your retirement savings account was for?! Orthopedic slippers and applesauce?!\n\nI'm gonna need a LOT of pain pills when I'm 70, also I'm betting most of my 401k will get converted to bottlcaps at some point anyway\n\nUnderrated comment. See you in the wasteland!\n\nKeep that big iron on you brotha\n\nIf you have a printer, you have a kitchen table vintage deck\n\nUpvote for the turn of phrase but bro don't you think you might turn to some more casual formats by then\n\nThis sounds so fun I wanna retire right now. Just put me in with the old gamers and let's do lan parties and board games all day long.\n\nYep! I can already see the complaints when the rec room PCs need hardware upgrades to play new games. \"We need to get the new NVIDIA  89000 Super Ti 2TB to play MSFS 2062!\"\n\nWhen youre paying the assisted living facilities 7k a month you better be getting top of the line gaming CPUs\n\nThat would be the budget low price retirement home however for that price\n\nThere's a lot of us gamers in the mid 40's already. I got 20 years til retirement. I can't fucken wait, although I will probably be at home with the wife.\n\nI'd rather be at the 4080 retirement home.\n\n2040s more like. I'll stop gaming when they pull my keyboard from my cold dead hands\n\nIm gaming in the after life cuhh\n\nLike any of us will be able to afford a retirement home let alone able to retire.\n\n2060???  Fuck that I'm already 40.  How about 2045\n\nWe'll all the dead soon.\n\nI hope so. Age of empires madness here I come. Hope arthritis treatments improve drastically in the upcoming years.\n\nIts gonna be a great time for retirement. Just massive lan parties. Our wives can hang out with one another\n\nRevenge for all those mall trips spent checking your phone 1000 times\n\nDude using the soundstage the mandalorian was filmed on as a monitor.\n\nI have an ultrawide and I have no clue how this dude is sitting so goddamn close to it\n\nYou ever play games with someone who never seems to notice anything on the mini map? This picture explains a lot.\n\nWho needs a mini map when you can see the entire map in landscape!\n\nThis guy can see the maps of games he isn't even playing.\n\nCan confirm. My buddy used a 50 inch TV sitting \\*maybe\\* two feet away from him to play a League of Legends support for 2 years. Didn't know what a mini map was until I convinced him to get a proper monitor.\n\n&gt;Didn't know what a mini map was \n\nOn a screen that size you just call it a map\n\n\"Why your minimap half the screen? It's not mini anymore. It's just 'map'.\"\n\nI need an update on enemy positions.\n\n*Rolls chair to far section of desk*\n\nThey are ganking bottom.\n\n*Rolls back to keyboard*\n\nHonestly with a monitor like that its no longer mini, its just \"map\".\n\nHe's leaned in too lmao\n\nWe're old 🤓\n\nThis image displays why 1000R should be required on all 32:9 screen. It’s simply unusable without reasonable width compression. He has to turn his head 90 degrees, both ways, to see end to end.\n\n...Or turns the mouse. I doubt he ever looks left or right. Probably just enjoys the experience of periphery vision to feel more engaged.\n\nUnless he wants to look at the mini map that’s an entire time zone away.\n\nHuds can usually be customized tho\n\n80% of the UI is on the edge of the screen my dude.\n\npaltry rhythm mighty close cooperative run ad hoc oatmeal fine numerous\n\nSuper UW will inevitably require a bit more user envolvment. Some games do offer UI settings, others require a config edit, others require a community mod. Luckily there’s enough dedicated folks to assist.\n\nHowever, none of this has to do with my statement on panel curve.\n\n\"No, Dave, you can't bring your dual monitor setup, we don't have much space so everyone is limited to one monitor.\"\n\n\"Got it.\"\n\nThe Volume.\n\nAnd the guy on the other end playing on top of a filing cabinet and sitting on a chair thrown out of a dentists office in 1997.\n\nHilarious comment, if you are curious though it’s called samsung odyssey neo9\n\nGot one myself. Love it. Can't get that close and can give me motion sickness if I play FOS games..\n\npretty certain that is not a Samsung g9 neo, doesn't look curved enough\n\nI'm appalled that no one is duct taped to one of those beams\n\n[Yeah, it's LAN Party 101!](https://i0.wp.com/ducttapedgamer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/ThereItIs-1-717x1024.jpg?ssl=1)\n\nAll I can think of is how will he pee\n\nJust help a bro out\n\n...and open your mouth!\n\nlemonade, sweet sweet lemonade\n\n[give it a lick!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UqAB--LIGM)\n\nMMMmm It tastes just like raisins\n\nLook at my horse, my horse is amazing!\n\nNot his problem. Let it tinkle, tinkle\n\nWouldn't his arms get tired very quick from hanging down like that?\n\nNerd strength\n\nImagine how tired his fucking neck would be pretty much instantly.\n\nHis parents took tummy time incredibly serious when he was an infant in preparation\n\nA teenager hopped up on Surge, adrenaline, and maybe a bit of weed? He'll be good for a few hours.\n\n&gt; Surge\n\nThere's a name I haven't heard in a while.\n\nThese guys have more disposable income now and hence the mansion.\n\nThat means more money for duct tape\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/m5t6YmA.png](https://i.imgur.com/m5t6YmA.png) for the uninformed\n\nYou can smell that picture, lol.\n\nThank you for posting the picture without the Tumblr text.\n\nHe even has these beautiful beams and everything! But in this economy no one can afford to waste duct tape anymore\n\nYou are right, I will now downvote this because it is missing such a key ingredient\n\nThat's some late teens/early 20s BS. Can't do that at 40\n\nthat s a serious fckn monitor geezus\n\nOh my god I was so busy trying to see what game they were playing I didn’t even realize that bitch is huge\n\nMeanwhile third guy got the poverty setup lol\n\nYou can tell who owns the house and who he values more as a friend\n\nJohn, you get the L table and concierge lumbar support chair.\n\nTodd, you get the filing cabinet and the chair left over from the wedding seating.\n\nFair, can my PC at least log into Windows?\n\nWe'll see...\n\nI love that you also realized he was on the lockscreen lol. 😆\n\nThere's also a long cable or extension cord in mid air in front of 2 doors leading to Todd's computer.\n\nPictures truly paint 1,000 words. It's priceless.\n\nBe honest the little too blurry for me to see but kind of looks like he's on Windows 7\n\nWell maybe if Todd had brought the beer to the last BBQ *like he was supposed to* he would get Windows 10.\n\nBro is going to be playing Doom by himself until he's asked to leave. *Because everyone is tired of course*\n\nMaby the $20 on the beer would have been worth it....\n\n&gt;Fair, can my PC at least log into Windows?\n\nWindows XP\n\nThis is what happens when you forget to bring the beer to the BBQ lke you *said you would!* Todd.\n\nThe known moocher will always get the shaft.\n\nHe's probably happy for a night away from home. The giant monitors arent the best gaming tools. Having to move your head, as dumb as it sounds, gets old real quick.\n\nIt's like the little brother controller with stick drift and a sticky B button\n\nBased on the left-to-right progression I'm assuming there's a fourth guy off-screen to the right pinched off in the corner with a $500 Dell notebook rocking Intel Graphics balanced on his knees.\n\nI was going to say — you can practically draw the lines of economic divide just by looking at the chairs alone lol\n\nA real hierarchy of equipment there.\n\nSo, what game are they playing?\n\nWarzone\n\nI’m not sure. But whatever it they are locked IN\n\nIdk but I'm pretty sure the guy by the door is just updating windows.\n\nGot blue screened\n\nLooks like Warzone to me\n\nImagine how immersive it is during driving games when you have to turn your whole fucking head to see beside you lol.\n\nPretty sure thats the \"married with 2-3 kids\" set up.\n\nThen there's the guy with the old 23” LCD in the back lol. Seems a bit lopsided\n\nAnd he’s sitting on like a dining room table chair while the other guys have crazy robot chairs\n\nThe adult version of getting the mad catz controller\n\nHe's the guy with a wife and two kids, lol\n\nCould be a preference. I have bigger screens but actually enjoy more on my 24\" monitor. I don't need to move my neck and not much eye movement to see the minimap.\n\nHe is the best player, they just handicapped him when they play together.\n\nI mean, if you're a 40 year old PC gamer, you probably have disposable income. Might as well get an awesome monitor.\n\nAwesome until you need to check the minimap...\n\nIf they're playing CoD, there is a setting to move the HUD inward if you're playing on an ultrawide so you don't have to turn your head to look at the minimap and shit.\n\nSource: I have that same monitor and play a shit ton of CoD lol\n\nSeriously, support for these things is all over the place. Most games have cheat protected fov so you're not even allowed to set it to something appropriate for the width. You end up just stretching the 75-90fov across 3x the distance.\n\n*If* you can set your fov to something sensible in the 120-140 range, *and* hud elements respect a safe zone similar to where it would be on a standard monitor, then I'm sure it's awesome. For all 12 games that support it. \n\nWith the right kind of game, though, VR is just better and cheaper.\n\nWar thunder and Armored Core 6 are the only 2 I noticed work right out of the box like that. It's really disappointing. At least give us the old overscan method. Those usually only applied to the HUD iirc\n\n\nEdit: found another one. Tiny combat area lets you choose where your HUD is, based on a screen ratio selection.\n\nThat shit's too big for how close he's sitting.\n\nThere's a specific spot you're supposed to sit for curved monitors to work properly because the curve is intended to take advantage of your peripheral vision.\n\nSomeone’s gonna sneak up to his side like Batman does to the thugs in the Arkham games, and he’s going to be just as oblivious\n\nI am a 40yo PC gamer and do not have disposable income. kids and a wife use up a lot of $$ (and theres nothing wrong with that).\n\nBUT apparently according to the picture in this post, what I need is rich gamer friends who live close by.\n\n&gt;I mean, if you're a 40 year old PC gamer, you probably have disposable income\n\n[insert meme of puppet looking at camera then looking away]\n\nIt's a mixed blessing. I've got a similar monitor.\n\nSome games support super-ultrawides very well; either UI elements are kept near the center of the screen, or there's an option to do that.\n\nSome games give you the bare minimum of support. It technically works, and is totally playable, but critical UI elements like minimaps, healthbars, and ammo counters are pushed out to the corners where you can't see them without turning your head.\n\nAlternatively, some games will let you play in 16:9 or 21:9 letter-boxed, which works very well but is a bit disappointing.\n\nAnd then some games just shit the bed entirely. There are few games that are literally unplayable, but it's not 0. A lot of games will stretch things to the full width of the monitor, pushing artwork and critical UI elements below your monitor where there not visible nor can they be interacted with.\n\nIt takes a lot of work to get the most out of a monitor like this. Borderless Gaming helps with some of the worst offenders. Also, DisplayFusion is a must for managing all that screen real estate when you're not gaming.\n\nYou can also use the free Microsoft PowerToys that includes FancyZones that doesn't divide your big screen into multiple monitors, but instead lets you snap windows into specific zones you define. \n\nDisplayFusion sounds like another great solution, but I haven't tried it, so I can't really advise one solution over the other.\n\nAt that age either bigger screen or new glasses. But no one turns down a bigger screen\n\nWell.. no. I think my comfort zone is a curved 32\" at 16:9, anything bigger or wider is a no from me as I'm actually having a harder time instantly seeing critical parts of the image and have to move my head around too much. For movies and TV shows, I have a projector.\n\nthe 49\" 32:9 is a beast. I used one from 2020 - early 2024 and it was a rough experience overall. Very few games are compatible with it, it really pushes game engines to the limits\n\nThe best way to use that monitor outside of 32:9 applications is to use the PBP mode to split the monitor into two - 21:9 + 11:9\n\nI bought one back in 2020, had all the issues you mentioned and I ended up replacing it with a 48” LG CX. However, I finally discovered the perfect use for it a couple months ago. I started running a D&amp;D game for some friends using Foundry VTT. Holy crap, 32:9 is PERFECT for this use case 😁\n\nDude in the back has to put his rig on top of a plastic shelving unit because fucking Steve just *had* to bring his ultra wide.\n\nI bet it's a 49in ultra curve! I got the odyssey g9 49 just like that about a year ago. Best purchase I've done!\n\nY'all are talking about the computers and the monitors and I'm just looking at the size of the room and going holy fuck my apartment would fit in there.\n\npeople don't usually post pics of their living space on reddit, unless they're absolutely loaded. Or those are the ones that get the most attention and upvotes\n\nI noticed that\n\nBunch of nerds. Why wasn’t I invited?!? 😂\n\nYou are not 40 years old i guess\n\nJust turned 50. Guess I gotta find the older crowd. Lol\n\nYeah why are you trying to hang out with a bunch of 40 year olds ya creep?\n\nI’m part Jack Nicholson and part Leonardo DiCaprio. Gotta groom them young! 😎\n\n*Points to the Atari 2600 corner*\n\n😜\n\nI'm 40, I want in\n\nFeel bad for the guy who got the 15” monitor, the ikea Alex cabinet desk and a spare chair from the patio dining set. Just don’t invite home next time if he doesn’t take the hint!\n\nnah that's peak gaming right there. No fancy nonsense, just the game.\n\nYeah I bet his ass is carrying the others every damn time.\n\nHigher FPS, better IRL FOV\n\nGaming like it's 2008. I used to play HoN on a wooden deck chair, with the wooden armrest as my mouse pad, and my laptop on the other left side. It was some of the best gaming times of my life.\n\nLike 2008? It's more like peak 90's LAN party here.\n\nThat's only because the guy on the step-stool and the wobbly folding card table is out of the frame on the far right.\n\nCan only see him if you're using the big monitor.\n\nThat's the non gamer friend that's using loaned gear.\n\nHe got the equivalent of the Mad Catz controller setup.\n\nLooks like he's trying to log in to win XP\n\nActually its probably like 21\"... I think the other monitors are just comically huge\n\nHe's the little brother that got the unplugged controller as a kid.\n\nHe has the best back, so he gets the worst setup lol\n\nI bet he’s hilarious though\n\nDude isn't even in-game. He's on HDD while his friends are on SSD. Poor guy.\n\nHow did they get inside your house?\n\nYou guys lock your doors?\n\nIf you’ve played games as a kid, teen, young adult, adult then you too will probably still be playing as you get older. It’s just a fun hobby and these guys are probably having a great time lol. To them it’s not just gaming because they managed to get away from the kids (if they have them) and wife (if married). It’s a fuckin dream vacation 😂.\n\nwhat i dont play anymore is sports games, driving and FPS which used to be what i liked (early versions of those....i'm old).   really anything multiplayer anymore\n\n\nSingle player RPGs,  strategy type games, stuff i can do at my own pace.\n\nWeirdly for me, as I got older and my brain thinks he's more clever, I have a hard time getting into single player games.  I can just picture the writers and the tropes.  They're all tropey, SLOW, and combat is completely boring.  The only exception for me is RDR2.  And Elden Ring (far more combat focused).\n\nI find myself actually playing competitive games today - rofl.  Overwatch 2, Street Fighter 6, etc., nothing gets a good rush vs an intelligent team / opponent in an equal setting.\n\nI think it gradually started with the Bioshock sequel.  Too many narration and TLOU was basically a visual novel... ugh.\n\nI do stay away from twitchy FPS such as Call of Duty or whatever.  CS2 is still fun, but it's stale after 2 decades.\n\nYeah, to me if I only have an hour or so, I'd rather get in a few competitive matches. I feel like to enjoy an RPG I need a few hours to enjoy being immersed.\n\nYeah, I am 48 and I grew up with video games. People my age are probably the first full generation of gamers, who have gone from Atari to Nintendo to Playstation, PC and beyond.\n\nI'd rather do this than sit and watch TV like my parents and grandparents did, at least my brain is active.\n\nIt is just what we do, and it is part of people's lives now, not just a  nerd hobby.\n\nMy wife is preggo and she gets really tired so she sleeps earlier than me now. We have a bunny who is nocturnal so she asks me to stay up with him so he doesnt get bored. I just play videogames till 12-1pm and the bunny chills with me while my wife gets her rest. Thats all i got time for gaming these days\n\nYo, I am in my 40's!! Can I cruise by and hang out too?\n\nSame!\n\nWhat games?\n\nCod warzone, can see the contract on the left below the minimap\n\nActually, two of them are gaming and the third one is waiting for the stupid windows update that interrupted his session (that's my head canon on this).\n\nLAN party rules state that someone has to reinstall Windows, so I'm guessing he just got it up and running and now he can start redownloading everything\n\n[deleted]\n\n40's or 50's?\n\nSome rough looking 40 year olds\n\nAlcohol and gaming lol\n\nThat monitor is way too fucking big 😂\n\nWhat if dude on left didn't live there? Lmfao he brought that bitch to the session just to show broke boy on the other end he ain't shit hahaha! 🤣\n\nI miss lan party’s.\n\nSave your eyes my dude\n\nHands down, the one on the right is the OG!\n\nThere's just one thing missing - Tums, for the inevitable upset stomach\n\nIs it sorted from most money to least money? Have fun guys!\n\nI wonder how hot the room is with all the machines?\n\nJust had an adult lan party with 6 PCs in a 15x15 room with a window ac unit. It never got hot\n\nDudes have high mileage on em. Look like pushing into 60s.\n\nThat suuuper ultrawide monitor looks fun! What's the brand and resolution of that beast?\n\nI've never actually seen one in person and wonder how comfortable it would be to play on (for the neck). But it does look impressive!\n\nSounds like you had a great time!\n\nSuper Ultrawide is the right term. They have a 32:9 aspect ratio and are 49+ inches, with either dual ~~2K~~ 1440p (5120x1440) or dual ~~4K~~ 2160p (7680x2160) resolution.  \nSetting the display at the right height and distance from your eyes makes it a breeze to glance at the sides without moving your head. \nThe person in the photo set theirs up too close to their seat, I can't imagine their neck will appreciate it in the morning.\n\n[deleted]\n\nI think maybe the monitor isn't quite as wide as it seems in this shot. If you look at the two doors on the right, one is much wider than the other, and the desktop next to the ultrawide looks horizontally stretched to me, too.\n\nWhats that chair the guy on the far left is using?\n\nHinomi H1 Pro from the look of it\n\nThat's called winning at life : I see grown men doing something they like whatever people think, and it's awesome\n\n[deleted]\n\n&gt; Senior centers are going to look like lan centers in the future.\n\nI think ya'll are drastically over-estimating how well we treat our senior citizens in places like that lol...\n\n2 guys playing games and the poor sysadmin working in Vmware\n\n40 year olds:  We Started LAN parties back in the 90s, and we are gonna Keep doing them.\n\nThese are my people...\n\nsomeone photoshop The lan guy from the rafters\n\nStill doing this with my 40 year old friends to this day. lol. Good times\n\nOh no, you don't have motion blur on do you?\n\nMy head, eyes, and neck would not feel good after having to constantly be looking to both side of the screen on that wide ass monitor.\n\nEspecially in a fast pace game or FPS shooter like Call of Duty. Certain type of games it would be fine I guess.\n\n“All boys want is one thing”\nLiterally video games\n\nI just hope I have something that gets me as excited as them at 40!\n\nDoes anyone really need a screen that wide?\n\nWe have them at work (I'm a CAD programmer) and they're awesome for that. Basically two 27\" next to each other without a border in the middle. Also great for office work and things like ERP systems where you have lots of windows open. Don't like it for gaming apart from things like sim racing.\n\nWe have the Samsung Odyssey OLED G9, delivery guy was not happy having to carry 8 of them haha.\n\nSim racing gang just entered the chat. Yes we need it! :-)"

    "all_comment_text": "A toss up between this and Kingdom Come: Deliverance, which, if you put it on the highest difficulty, will kill you at the loading screen because infant mortality was high during that time.\n\nThere’s actually only a 90% chance of it killing you at the start, which normally is high enough until I told my friend there’s a surprise for him when he starts Hardcore and it didn’t happen.\n\nWas that actually the infant mortality rate though? 90% seems REAL high.\n\nHigh enough that children didn’t get names until they survived infancy\n\nAlso kids used to get their dead siblings names and identity. My grandpa didn't want to waste a day time off his farm to go the city to register my uncle so he let him have the identity of his older brother who died as baby. It wasn't until my uncle got an army summon letter when he was just 15 that he had to rectify it.\n\nSo did Vincent van gogh and it fucked with him regularly visiting the grave of Vincent van gogh with his family.\n\nWell shit that’ll stump people at trivia\n\n\nWho was Vincent Van Gogh named after?: Vincent Van Gogh\n\nInfant van Gogh\n\nInfant Van Gone\n\nYou are now worthy of the name of this family and shall forever be known as a Choksondik. please carry this name well, young Lotta. \n\nIt’s pronounced Cooksoondeek.\n\nSee this comment right here. This is why I wake up and go on Reddit\n\nMy wife is Korean and even her mother doesn’t know her real birthday because they had a system where they would register your survival or something after some time and then you had a birthday. It’s pretty gnarly\n\n&gt;My wife is Korean and even her mother doesn’t know her real birthday because they had a system where they would register your survival or something after some time and then you had a birthday. It’s pretty gnarly\n\nMy fiancée is half Korean, and I believe you're talking about the 100-day celebration Baegil, as in 100 days after the actual day of birth.\n\nI think that’s similar. There’s a celebration, but official like the official government registration. Like her mom has two birthdays. One actual and one reported. Granted this was shortly after the war so maybe that’s why\n\nIf i recall correctly, everyone in Korea born during the same year turns one years old, according to the government, on the same day regardless of actual birthdate. You have your individual birthday as well, but officially you are already one year old by the new year.\n\nThat’s true as well, but this was more actual birth day vs reported to be alive day\n\nIt depends on where you lived and whether or not you were in the ruling class of the time, but from what I've read, infant mortality was about 50% prior to the 19th century.\n\nThis is also why modern medicine has made the Earth's population absolutely explode. Better infant mortality rates + much higher life expectancy = giant population booms. What's interesting is that, a couple generations removed from the advent of modern medicine, population isn't rising nearly as high.\n\nYeah it tends to self-correct. People used to beat the reaper through attrition, but once bearing 8 kids meant having to *raise* 8 kids to adulthood people realized that sucked and decided to bear fewer of them. Especially with raising children getting more expensive, not being able to employ them as a labor/income source for the family, etc.\n\n&gt; once bearing 8 kids meant having to raise 8 kids to adulthood people realized that sucked and decided to bear fewer of them  \n  \nCunk on Earth tier explanation\n\n“Population in some countries start to decline after the release of the Belgian techno anthem Pump Up the Jam by Technotronic.”\n\nIts a pattern that has been seen in every industrialized society since Britain in the 1850s, It happens in 4 distinct stages-\n\nStage 1) Pre-Industrial- High Birth Rate, High Childhood Mortality Rate- During this time a society has a population that is stable if not very, very slightly growing. Many children die in childhood so the actual number of adults that make it to the age to have their own children hinders population growth.\n\nStage 2) Early Industrialization- Advancements in technology mean children don't die as frequently, however people still have kids at similar rates to before since more hands means more farmers/more factory workers. Population _Skyrockets_ at an exponential rate. Equatorial Guinea is arguably here basically right now.  \n\nStage 3) Late Industrialization- Kids are expensive. As the benefit of more children diminishes and costs rise (instead of farming they're going to college, negating the benefit of more children) the birth rate drops towards the now lower childhood mortality rate, although the population is still growing significantly (but much slower than stage 2)\n\nStage 4) Post Industrialization- Growth rate stabilizes at a comparable rate to Stage 1, except with far less childhood mortality and far fewer children born. Children born in these societies will generally go through decades of schooling and training before entering the workforce as an adult.  \n\nStage 5? A proposed stage to represent the modern era- One part that isn't explained by the above stages are the population decreases seen in Europe and Japan/SK/China. It's speculated that the costs of childbearing are so high in addition to other societal factors that population actually decreases, putting a larger and larger burden on the young adults which likely suppresses the growth rate even further. Since most social safety nets are based on a growing population (or at least a stable one) this is extremely concerning for govt budgets/programs where this is occurring\n\nThe USA is in Stage 5 as well, we've just been able to offset the demographics problems by admitting new citizens from Stage 2-3 countries.\n\nAnd China's a weird case because some *questionable* policy decisions cratered population growth around the start of Stage 3 for about 35 years.\n\nYou forgot stage 6: profit\n\nInfanticide has also been a pretty standard way of family planning for a lot of human history.\n\nNot necessarily, and for two reasons. \n\n1: you don’t always die as an infant, there’s a dozen or so causes of death that pop up. What matters is you die before the point where the game begins, whether that be as an infant child or teen\n\n2: it’s only 90% the first time you start a hardcore game. After that it drops to something like 30 or 40.\n\nNo. Not at all but 30-50% which already was brutal as f***… Bach had 7 kids, 4 survived. Edward the 3rd had 5 sons of whom 3 survived and then of course some people had no kids because they were barren…\n\nSome modern scholars somehow brought up the idea though that people didn’t care about their children… that is clearly wrong though. We have plenty of examples of grieving parents over infant deaths.\n\nWait, that's actually random?\n\nI thought it just played two back to back death messages for the goof.\n\nOkay I just checked [the wiki on it](https://kingdom-come-deliverance.fandom.com/wiki/Hardcore). First try is 90% chance of failure, second is 60%, after that it’s permanently 20%.\n\nI once had it a second time and thought it was a bug\n\nI’ve always been indifferent to trying this game - until now.\n\nPerfect time to play it with a sequel going to be released later this year\n\nAre you trying to tell me that Henry's coming to see us?\n\nJesus Christ be praised!\n\nIm on my third playthrough right now, definitely should try it atleast for the first 3-5 hours to get the feel of the game mechanic or combat and the world as a whole.\n\n\nthe side quest(not the repeatable one) are entirely unique similar to witcher 3, where you find the quest itself is more memorable than the quest reward.\n\nThis was a game that I went into with no expectations, and have never been more immersed in my life.  The story, the cities, and the buildings all really existed, and [much of it still does](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u9khmaIa6M).  You can go into google streetview and see buildings from the game still standing.  It's mind blowing.  Give it a shot, you won't regret it.\n\nKingdom come is such a underrated gem\n\nThat’s fucking hilarious.\n\nI've played kingdom come, but I never noticed this! It's just an excuse for another play through!\n\nI just started hardcore mode in KCD and didn't managed to get this. I must've been the lucky one in the middle ages.\n\n\"Don't worry this doesn't affect combat. Just every other aspect of your life\"\n\nWhat funny is too 100% the game you have to play as black characters on mastermind difficulty. The achievement is called... the token experience🤣\n\nTolkien you racist/s.\n\n\"No, no, no, no, no. I distinctly remember Cartman wearing a t-shirt that spelled it T-O-K-E-N\"\n\n\"Yeah dude because Cartman's a fucking moron\"\n\nThe subtitles on older episodes were changed from Token to Tolkein on the south park official site\n\nThe fucking dedication\n\nYeah but if you go back to stick of truth, he spells his name \"Token\" in his facebook profile lol\n\nWhat about \"Token Black Productions\" in the Honey Boo Boo episode ;)\n\nWe know but that's the joke. You don't need to find actual proof because that's not the joke.\n\nWait, his name was retconed?\n\nYeah, just for a joke lol\n\nYes, in one of the best episodes in recent years. Highly recommend watching it.\n\ni watched it just yesterday and its amazing how hilarious this episode it. its everything you expect from south park\n\nFor every character but Stan who still has Token, that's sheer dedication to the bit\n\nNot just that, but Stan and Randy's dialogue subtitles still say Token before they found out.\n\nactually one of the funniest retcons in history, just flat out perfect\n\nMy lord that episode was fucking hilarious. \"Of course thats his name what'd you think it was?\"\n\nWhat's even better was the day that episode was released, every single instance of Tolkein's name in every single previous episode was fixed in the subtitles.\n\nI wish they'd have patched the games too\n\nEven better was them gaslighting everyone by going back and retroactively changing his name everywhere.\n\nYea they changed most of the subtitles from past episode to tolkien but not all of them.\n\nWhat’s even funnier, in those older episodes if stan says his name, it’s still token\n\nI know they updated the name on every YouTube video and the wikis. Did they update the games too?\n\nTolkien!! You are the problem./s\n\nHes not wrong.... Enemies are just as difficult to fight no matter what, BUT EVERYTHING ELSE IS AFFECTED, You get less money less drops ETC\n\nI loved playing as my character which was a black American Transgender atheist.\n\nI love the part when you are in heaven, talking to Jesus, telling him you are an atheist.\n\nWe don't take kindly to black American transgender atheists round here!\n\nNow skeeter, he ain't hurtin nobody.\n\n“Well, if it isn’t a cis boy. We don’t take kindly to your kind round here” made me die laughing.\n\n\"Well, I don't take kindleh to you sayin you don't take kindleh to my kind round here!\"\n\nOh man, me too. No matter what you choose during that conversation they’re out to get you. I still laugh about it randomly just thinking “It’s a cisgendered boy! Get ‘im!”\n\nWe need to burn a lower case t so they understand they're in \"trouble\" if they stay here\n\nI thought the lower case t was for *time to leave* and it's only lit at night so people can see it better.\n\n\"Why are you stuttering like that?\"\n\n\"Dialogue tree\"\n\nNow hop [into Mr. slave](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5M7w_npBpA)'s asshole!\n\nPff that's easy mode. Now try playing as a black American Transgender atheist **vegan**.\n\nThat's just not true. You read one line in a polygon article and didn't read the next that said the developer confirmed it did nothing.\n\nBut the second layer to the joke is that nothing else is affected at all, there is literally no difference \n\nI just went through this.  Wanted to make a Drow character, melee, was creating character, white hair, outfit etc. and couldn't find skin color.  When I reached that screen, I laughed and said 'oh no' at the same time.    \n  \nThey made me laugh before I really started the game, so that's a good start!\n\nHave fun! I loved both RPGs a lot. They’re so much better than they had any right to be.\n\nI haven't played FBH, but the stick of truth underpants gnome boss flight will forever live rent free in my head.\n\nA QTE to dodge your dad's balls is peak gaming\n\nI remember having to watch it on YouTube after because we got a censored version in Australia, the way they censored it was hilarious in its own right though \n\nThat and the Bat in the... errr... Mr. Slave level\n\nYea they kinda lacked in terms of complexity (which I think the base system especially in the second one could have pulled of really well) but they are perfect for their runtime.\n\nThe combat in FBH was actually more complex than I expected it to be. Which I never got tired of, but I know some people found it tedious after a while.\n\nI think people mostly find it tedious because theres obvious \"best\" things you can do and you can't really optimize for more interesting builds. The DLC DNA things bring a lot more felxibility into it but even then you quickly find optimal things you wanna do and rarely switch around. \n\nI mean again, for it's runtime this works really well but there's this \"this could have actually been a really really good complex rpg\" feeling I get when playing this game. The framework was there but I also respect the decision to create a really interesting system but keeping the game fresh and brief.\n\nWell &gt;!you can't fight Morgan Freeman if you pick the \"hardest difficulty\" here!!&lt;\n\nif you go to 'very difficult' you can automatically play bass\n\nthese are the rules lol\n\nYou've just got to look for it in the basement.\n\nYou can be as pissed as you want, just give me a goddamn bass line!\n\n...god damnit\n\nI love that scene\n\n*What, I don't play bass*\n\n*/tries bass guitar*\n\n*God dammit*\n\nHow many times do we have to go over this, you can play bass.\n\nAlso you can't fight the secret boss...he just gives you his reward!\n\nDo you also get a bonus +1 to your faith stat?\n\n🎶 I want to get down on my knees and start pleasing Jesus. I wanna feel his salvation all over my face. 🎶\n\nMan it sounds like you really love Jesus\n\n\"Well, what are you saying, that *you* don't really love Christ?!\"\n\nIf I'm lying, may the Lord strike me down right now\n\n🎶Whenever I see Jesus up on that cross\n\n\nI can't help but think that he looks kinda hot🎶\n\nAnd in *Stick of Truth* there’s a Jew job class among normal DnD classes like Mage and Fighter. You have an attack that literally circumcises your enemies causing them to Bleed and Grossed Out 😂\n\nAnd if you find Jesus as a Jew class, you will get an achievement for it\n\nAlso if you hover over the jew class option, it says something like: “a jew huh? I guess we will never really be friends”\n\nAnd you have a move called Jew Jitsu lol\n\nOmg my character was white and I picked Thief and Cartman goes, \"A white thief huh? Never heard of one of those\"\n\nOh god I was a black Jew! Didnt Cartman had a unique line for those?\n\nSomeone watching RTGame's playthrough? lmao\n\nTo add insult to injury, the circumcision is performed with a potato peeler\n\nI can't remember if it's this one or the first one, but when I had to pick my race, I chose Latino because that's what I am, and Mr. Mackey said something about that not being a real race, so I picked Hispanic, and he said the same thing. I was so confused and thought it was just the game fucking with me. I then Googled it and went down a rabbit hole and a bunch of YouTube videos proving that he was right. I learned a couple of things, and I was even more confused. I don't even know what I am anymore, and I hate that South Park made me aware of it and think of it every time someone asked what my race is. Lol\n\nThat actually sort of explains why “white” usually has options for Latin/hispanic or not. Also why lots seem to changing to having Caucasian as an option, with some form of Latin/hispanic as a different choice. I always wondered about it.\n\n[deleted]\n\nIt's immensely stupid, ethnicity is what matters, culture.\n\nDoing it by physical attributes is like grouping people by hair color.\n\nIts why its always funny when people (like me) whistfully dream of a reality where humans had tails or ears or any number of other defining features and yet it would lead to far harsher xenophobia than just casual racism. We cant even handle having slightly different *skin colors*\n\nThere is a Rick and Morty episode where an alien race who got freed from a hivemind that enslaved them proceeded to murder one another because of the shape of their nipples.\n\n(The hivemind's core then berated the protagonists like \"see the shit they do on their own will? That's why I enslaved them!\")\n\nOr the episode with the snake planet, and Rick makes fun of the snakes because they have classism that’s based on the differences in color.\n\n&gt;or ears\n\nYou guys don't got ears?\n\nIt wasn’t randomly decided. Part of the enlightenment involved rediscovering old Greek and Roman texts (they weren’t actually lost, just held onto by the church). Some of these texts, such as Plato, gave rise to the idea that some people were meant to be slaves. That, coupled with some good old pseudoscience, led to the racial theory we know and love today\n\nYeah, in latin america we are all so mixed that we don’t do census for race, usually just (nationality), depending on the country afro-descendants, and native tribes. Saying Latino is a race would be wrong because a Mexican, a Peruvian, and an Argentinian don’t look anything a like but all share in some degree european, native, and african genes. \n\nIt’s weird how in the US there’s a divide of your ethnicity even though they are all American. Like I’ve had friends who’s parents were spaniards, another one who’s parents were arab, and another who’s parents were asian, but they all identify themselves as Mexicans cuz they were born in Mexico\n\nThe good news is that no race is “real”; it’s a social construct.\n\nchunky distinct cows deer worm afterthought unwritten jar sloppy wrench\n\nIt was nothing but a product of your diseased mind. Why would a car ever drive in a circle? Where are they coming from, and where are they going? You've entered a state of delusion and never stopped to ask if any of it makes sense.\n\ncobweb cake stupendous forgetful homeless longing oil impossible numerous political\n\nThere is an \"They have playd us for absolute fools\" post that will do numbers in racing subs here for someone willing to make it.\n\nThe definition of \"race\" changed with the times and it was never a biological or even cientific thing, mostly just to justify racism\n\nLmfao\n\nCurious what you concluded. There’s def a difference (medical outcomes wise) between people of Spanish colonial descent and aboriginal populations. But still less genetically diverse than any two given people in different regions of Africa.\n\nIt only gets better the more you play. Those games crack me up 😂\n\nI love how in the first one they ask you your name like any other game only for them to call you Douchebag the entire time\n\nMy first \"oh boy this is gonna be fun\" in stick of truth was cartmans reaction if u chose the \"jew\" class.... \"Oh so we can never be friends, huh?\"\n\n# MICROAGGRESSION! Hit em\n\njew might actually be the best class though EXCLUSIVELY BECAUSE of the circumcision ability\n\nI lost it when I got grounded and I was like we're super heroes butters. We can just jump out the window. Then you just fall and die 😆 🤣 \n\nWho goes for the Tolkien Black experience\n\nEdit. Fixed his last name that I couldn’t remember.\n\nIt actually was \"Token\" for a while until his dad revealed it as Tolkien.\n\n&gt; for a while\n\nFor like 20 years you mean\n\nI never got the joke, can somebody explain it l?\n\nThere's a black character on South Park whose name was always \"Token,\" as in \"the token black character,\" but the writers intentionally never referenced that and never showed the spelling. Then when they found an opportunity to subvert expectations further, they recently revealed his name is \"Tolkien\" from Lord of the Rings and comically implied we're all racist for assuming he was the token black character.\n\nEven funnier is they’re gaslighting us by changing all the subtitles to match Tolkien\n\nthey did show the spelling.\n\nIIRC they only showed it in subtitles, and they retroactively changed the subtitles to say Tolkien for everyone except Stan.\n\nWow that is some dedication to the joke.\n\nYou see \"Token\" in the episode \"Raising the Bar\", the film Kyle and Token make is made by \"Token Black Productions\".\n\ncartman had a \"token's life matters\" shirt\n\n&gt;There's a black character on South Park whose name was always \"Token,\" as in \"the token black character,\" but the writers intentionally never referenced that and never showed the spelling\n\nIsn't his full name Token Black? Lol\n\nCartman wore a shirt that said \"Tokens Life Matters\", Think there is a few other places too like the lists for penis size and attractiveness.\n\n&gt; and never showed the spelling\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1d1mdp696vh81.jpg?width=1000&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3d7026fbfd1047e7496a42948ca65b7373a90a7f\n\nHe signed a contract with Super Awesome Talent Agency (S9E3) with his name.\n\nNo it’s always been Tolkien\n\nJust like Leopold “Butters” Stotch\n\nYou mean Victor?\n\nYou mean Mantequilla?\n\nCanonically yeah, but before the reveal the name was just \"token\"\n\nNo, it was Token until they retconned it as Tolkien.\n\nBesides all the other evidence, do you not even remember Cartman wearing the 'Token's Life Matters' shirt?\n\nThey actually explain this in the same episode when Stan said this, and they answered with: \"Do you actually take Cartman words for the truth ? Yes, he wrote Token on his shirt because... Well... Cartman is a racist bigot.\"\n\nYeah, but there was also the thing in Raising the Bar where the production company was named \"Token Black Productions\" https://youtu.be/9z24VB5Leik\n\nInb4 the \"*Tolkien\" comment\n\nBeat him by 18 minutes\n\nI did on my second playthrough for the trophy. lol\n\nThey do have a sense of humor\n\nThe game is named 'The Fractured Butthole' after all\n\nBruh how did I not realise this until I read your comment…\n\nIt's also in the game. You fracture your butthole at one point.\n\nWell, guess I know why \"show don't tell\" is dead, cause we're not smart enough for it.\n\nGood friend recently bought me the South Park pack on Xbox.  Haven't started Fractured, was told to play Stick first.\n\nyes\n\nBoth are great.\n\nThe first 2 South Park games are funny as hell.\n\nFirst two? I thought there were only two?\n\n[The first South Park game was for the N64.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-exRgI9M2ZY)  That shows you how old we all are.  It was pretty amusing.\n\nThat’s not what the commenter was talking about though. There was a third game in the stick of truth run that came out recently and was critically panned across the board, called snow day.\n\nThere's a third one called Snow Day! from THQ\n\nAt least we have the first two.\n\nCan't lie. I love South Park games and Phone Destroyer has some fucking great moments. I love how at the end they tally up how much money you spent (I spent none) and then talk shit about it.\n\nThe DLC is worth paying for. Whole game is so much fun and I just didn’t want it to end.\n\nThe highest difficult bar you out of the secret boss anyways\n\nI still remember black youtubers reacting to it and laughing their asses off. Such an amazing idea, true to South Park\n\nunironically one of the best games of all time\n\nI’ve only played Stick of Truth but it’s a genuinely decent game with solid mechanics and a great sense of fun. A much better game than I ever would’ve expected.\n\nYou’d like this one then, really recommend it if your a South Park fan. This and the stick of truth are unironically great games lol.\n\nMaybe could've used a little more depth but yeah it's so fucking good.\n\nWe need a third South park rpg.\n\nimagine the conflict of an obsessive hardcore gamer, who is also extremely racist. they feel compelled to 100% a game on the hardest difficulty, but can't get over playing as a black character. this is the most challenging game there is for them.\n\nEveryone saying it makes the game actually harder: ‘\nWe reached out to the game’s publisher, Ubisoft, who had no official statement but confirmed that it’s just a joke,” GamesRadar reported. “It doesn’t affect combat difficulty or any other aspect of gameplay difficulty. The slider changes skin tone, but it’s purely cosmetic.” ‘\n\nSource: https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/340450/does-your-characters-skin-color-actually-affect-the-difficulty/340458#340458\n\nI don't get it\n\nThe darker the skin colour your character has, the harder the game gets.                                                                                   \nIt doesn't really change the difficulty, it was more a joke/statement.\n\nIt does change the difficulty, just not the fights. Less drops, less money.\n\nEDIT: Turns out that's a lie as proven by people with better memory than mine. So it seems that all it does are minor changes, like dialogues. But there's still a separate thing to change the difficulty of the enemies.\n\n\"Ubisoft San Francisco told Eurogamer that it does affect the amount of money you’ll receive and how other characters will interact with you. Then, bizarrely, Ubisoft took it back, telling Gamesradar that this was all just a joke.\" \n\nYeah that's a myth it seems\n\nThis was also true for The Stick of Truth.\n\n“Don’t worry this doesn’t affect the game just every other aspect of your life”\n\nEventually Cartman says \"this doesn't impact combat just any other aspect of the game/your life\" (not sure wich one)\n\nIt took me way too long to realize the name of this game was a butt joke\n\nAm I the only one not getting it? Could someone explain?\n\nSkin color.\n\nI gotta play this game again.  My favourite is the level where you need to escape being caught by pedophile priests in a church lol\n\nCant forget climbing into a gay mans ass to perform an abortion on a snuke\n\nNothing to do with the difficulty but the 1st game \"South Park - Stick of Truth\" has the most fucking crazy god damn scenes you have to play ever in the freaking history of video games.\n\nRotate your damn phone. You're taking a picture of a horizontal screen, for fuck's sake.\n\nA lot of people intentionally only take vertical photos these days because they work better on insta/snap. \n\nI didn't know this until recently when I went on a vacation trip and people kept chastising me for taking photos of them (for them) in landscape mode."

    "all_comment_text": "full quote:\n\n&gt;Regarding the Lawsuit\n\n&gt;Yesterday, a lawsuit was filed against our company for patent infringement.\n\n&gt;We have received notice of this lawsuit and will begin the appropriate legal proceedings and investigations into the claims of patent infringement.\n\n&gt;**At this moment, we are unaware of the specific patents we are accused of infringing upon, and we have not been notified of such details.**\n\n&gt;Pocketpair is a small indie game company based in Tokyo. Our goal as a company has always been to create fun games. We will continue to pursue this goal because we know that our games bring joy to millions of gamers around the world. Palworld was a surprise success this year, both for gamers and for us. We were blown away by the amazing response to the game and have been working hard to make it even better for our fans. We will continue improving Palworld and strive to create a game that our fans can be proud of.\n\n&gt;It is truly unfortunate that we will be forced to allocate significant time to matters unrelated to game development due to this lawsuit. However, we will do our utmost for our fans, and to ensure that indie game developers are not hindered or discouraged from pursuing their creative ideas.\n\n&gt;We apologize to our fans and supporters for any worry or discomfort that this news has caused.\n\n&gt;As always, thank you for your continued support of Palworld and Pocketpair.\n\nhow can nintendo file a lawsuit and not tell the other party what its about? how is this legal?\n\nRemember people, it’s in Japan. Majority of people don’t know how Japanese law works.\n\nI'm a redditor though, I know how everything works\n\nPocket Pair should hire Redditors, Nintendo stands no chance.\n\nDelete Facebook, hit the gym, lawyer... us?\n\nDon't forget to leave your partner Because they been, are, and will cheat on you\n\nDIVORCE. HIM. NOW. \n\n🤦‍♀️ Girl what are you even doing?!\n\n“In summing up it’s the constitution, it’s Mabo, it’s justice, it’s law, it’s the Vibe and, no that’s it, it’s the vibe. I rest my case.”\n\nYou got to be Australian to fully get this joke. Lol\n\nWhy did my dad leave ?\n\nHe tried to raise his kids to play games better than Destiny and left as a failure\n\nFuck. Thanks for the closure\n\nMost people don't know American law either. But people generally assume the law is/should be fair and then question when it isn't.\n\nLet's be real with ourselves, most western governments laws are so complex that most people have no idea how it actually works. We pretend to throw around legal terms like it means anything, but it doesn't.\n\nAs a lawyer - I'd caution you to maybe not believe initial non-legal press statements from only one side and taking it at face value, or judging what the actual law is based on those.\n\nThe problem often extends not just to people assuming that the law is “fair,” but also that it’s fair according to their extremely cursory understanding of the factors that might be in play. I’m not going to claim that law is always fair in either its form or its application, but it’s usually a lot closer to it than Redditors think it is.\n\nThat's why we're asking.\n\n&gt; how can nintendo file a lawsuit and not tell the other party what its about? how is this legal?\n\nNo idea what the civil procedure is like in Japan but it could be they were served with a notice of action, i.e. here's a notice that we plan to sue you, the lawsuit will follow once it has been filed\n\nLawsuit is filed with the courts and defendant is notified of the suit. The actual details will be communicated later once it has been processed and time will be given for them to mount a defense and respond.\n\nGoing to order Palworld to support this developer, fuck any company doing this type of shit.\n\nPatenting gameplay ideas is such a slippery slope.  If Nintendo has it their way, then it'll be the end of a lot of games, not just Palworld.\n\nSick of Nintendo doing things to 'protect their IP' but not doing anything good with their IP(like the way they hammered down on emulator sites, despite their emulated games being impossible/unaffordable in the 3rd hand market)\n\nImagine if early game devs had patented health/mana potions kek or crafting systems.\n\nimagine if ID had patented first person shooters\n\nCapcom tried to patent the entire fighting game genre back in the 1990s.\n\nThey might as well patent competitive 2d fighting game with HP bars at this point.\n\nBushido blade has no problem with that\n\nDamn you to hell and back. Now I goYt to buy Bushido blade 2 and do another play through.\n\nSquare should make a fighting game collection with BB, Ehrgeiz and Tobal.\n\nID is such a treasure in how they support the spirit of gaming, from popularizing legitimately groundbreaking algorithms like Fast Inverse Square Root to releasing the source code to their games and engines they understand that making money and supporting others aren't mutually exclusive.\n\nThe good old magic number of 0x5F3759DF.\n\nFast Inverse Square Root is still the closest thing to sorcery I've seen in real life.\n\nCould you explain the magic for someone absolutely horrid at math? (Vulnerably, I need to use a calculator for anything but the simplest things because I just can't, I've tried. Just pointing out the level of dumb math or over explanation I'll need if you'd be kind) If not that's perfectly fine too, just curious.\n\nThis. They know what people want through the fact that games like Palworld exist and are as popular as they are but instead of acting on it they just sue them and continue to pump out dogshit.\n\nHeck, I'm a diehard Pokemon fan. But i struggle with new releases finding much addiction to them. And online play isnt fun. It's never fun. And Nintendo servers since the D/P/Pl days are stilllll dogshit. Instead I've been alternating playthroughs of Emerald and Platinum on cartridge or emulating fan games like Radical Red.\n\nPokemon Infinite Fusion is hands down the best pokemon game ive ever played by *miles* and its a fan game. \n\nIf nintendo and the Pokemon Company spent a quarter of the effort properly using their IPs rather than being litigious, maybe they wouldnt have so many things to sue over in the first place. \n\nCan you imagine how much it would make them? Because apparently they cant.\n\nEdit: they didnt sue it because its free to get and fairly quiet on the world stage - i think they might have trouble proving damages in court.\n\nPirating Nintendo games is a civic duty\n\nLove it when humanity develops a collective \"fuck you\". We should do it more often.\n\nLove Mario.\nHate Nintendo.\n\nAnd keep doing it till they learn. We're here for the IP, not the corporate bullshit.\n\n[deleted]\n\nThey’ve sold pirated versions of their own games because even they can’t maintain their old stuff. They found it online and sold it.\n\nideas are already patented. There is a reason why shadow of war's 'nemesis system' doesn't exist elsewhere. It doesn't help that the patent office basically has no idea what they are doing with video games. The patent is so broad that virtually any 'level up' system for a boss falls under the patent to the point if an enemy keeps count of the times it has killed the player and does 1 'bonus' damage per player loss it actually falls under the nemesis patent\n\nWarframe has a nemesis a system like that, they level up if the player dies to them. I wonder why there hasn't been a fight there.\n\nBecause just them leveling up when you die to them isn't  the full Nemesis System\n\nThe Nemesis System was deep and fleshed out. Fuck WB for patenting that and the not even using it in other games.\n\n&gt; The Nemesis System was deep and fleshed out. Fuck WB for patenting that and the not even using it in other games.\n\nThe patent should be expiring in 2034 so just need to hold on one more decade to see it popping up in more games.\n\nBecause WB knows it's a bs patent and won't win in court. They did that so that if any game gets big enough then they can weigh their options. But ultimately, it's a scare tactic to discourage competition, they'd never win since their patent is egregiously broad.  I could see them going to court and tying a developer up in litigation though.\n\nHey WB, you’re having money troubles, we get that. Can you at least license Nemesis at $1/game sold? Because we’d really appreciate it. Thanks.\n\nThis has already been a thing for decades.  Good example is the nemesis system from the new LOTR games\n\nWould have loved to experience that system in a game I'm interested in.\n\nThe system is interesting, but also pretty simple.\n\n“Oh remember that guy you killed a few hours ago when you pushed him off a cliff? He somehow survived, got stronger, looks a bit different, and is now stalking you.”\n\nFun, but also simple. Definitely had a nemesis or two where it was “WTF how would you survive that” at times.\n\nBut can you imagine how it could have evolved if other creators were allowed to use the idea and modify it? It came out 10 years ago. If others were able to implement it in their own way it may not be just a simple design anymore.\n\nRight? I think it would’ve been a great addition to the more recent assassin creed games with the bounty hunters that track you. Most of them are randomly generated but it would’ve been awesome if they developed stories against you after the initial encounter.\n\nI heard a fun idea of useing it in a batman game.\n\nAs certain minions who start growing into powerful luietents that start gaining themes to their design based on the villian they work for.\n\nSome can be resilient to giving up info unless you use a fear of theirs. Like hanging them off a building side, or electricity as you scare them with a taser gadget\n Etc.\n\nThe year is 2055. Nintendo has patented all gameplay mechanics. You can only buy games from nintendo. Once there was an indie developer trying to start a game for free for everyone. Nintendo shot their family and their dog. Then sued them bc bleeding mechanics are owned by Nintendo. There is no salvation.\n\nImagine a game studio claiming that they invented, for example, something as basic in terms of concept as an open world game design with XP-progressing checklist-type quests. And then claiming some sort of blatant copyright on such a basic idea that its originality doesn't warrant any copyright claim.\n\n...or even worse, claiming that they invented let's say the live service game type, and expecting every other studio to pay a licensing fee for that.\n\nIt makes no sense, or too much sense. Monster capture is already an entire genre and Palworld is not the only game to use “Pokémon mechanics”.\n\nA successful takedown of Palworld and milking of Pocketpair’s IP will result in precedent worthy of suing Temtem, Nexomon, Coromon, Pocket Mortys, Card Monsters, Ooblets, Monster Crown, and I could go on…\n\nAbsolutely. Very good point imo. That's exactly what I am mostly concerned about. That there will be a precedent and that it will open up the appetite of other big companies moving in like vultures for copyright claims on every basic videogaming concept you can think of. (I am exaggerating but to a certain extent, I can see that happening)\n\nYeah, I don’t want to be stuck with Madden games because EA decides to patent basic football actions in video games. I don’t want to be stuck with Call of Duty because they patent specific usage of guns. I don’t want to be stuck with League of Legends because they patent specific aspects of MOBAs. And what if PUBG patented battle royale when they had the chance? Toxic &amp; anti-competitive.\n\nIt's uncommon but it's not a new practice, WB put a patent on the nemesis system and have never used it since\n\nYeah idk, if it was about copying designs i could somewhat see it. But its not about that, so Nintendo is just being scummy again as usual. \n\nTheres no place in this industry for “patenting” mechanics or systems. Thats how you hold advancements and innovation back, especially considering how ass theyre handling the Pokemon IP. \n\nTheyre just as bad as WB patenting the nemesis system\n\nNintendo: \"Stop infringing on out patents!\"\n\nPocketpair: \"What patent?\"\n\nNintendo: *shrug*\n\nIn fairness, Nintendo is not *supposed* to reveal what specific patents until the actual case. They aren't just throwing out anything and seeing what would stick, they are just holding their evidence until ~~trial~~ they are required to release it, which is not common but not unheard of in cases like these.\n\nEdited for clarity.\n\nHow are you supposed to prepare a defense if you don't know what you're being accused of?\n\nThat's the point, Japanese laws are that draconian.\n\nI feel like someone could make a game about that.\n\nObjection! If someone were to make a game about that, that would clearly fall under patent infringement!\n\n\"Red Plus Sign Redemption: Attack of the Pants Storage Compartment Monsters\"\n\nPhoenix Wright definitely had his work cut out for him.\n\nThe ace attorney series is based on the Japanese legal system being an incredibly unfair situation for the defense\n\nIt’s just Nintendo’s patent lawsuits tend to be so hilariously transparent about just being a cudgel to smaller entities they get laughed out of court anyways\n\nidk about using ace attorney as an example, 99% of the cases there are murder\n\nBusiness takeover? Murder. Finding your lost father? Murder. Having a whimsical day at the aquarium? Believe it or not, murder.\n\nAnd all of them somehow end up connected to Maya Fey\n\nNintendo is def one case of a Patent Troll..\n\nBut yes JP legal system is a legit circus show...\n\nGot any circus-ey examples? I'm genuinely curious\n\nWell their famous 90% conviction rate or however higher it was is just bull if you deep dive into reading about it. Their police is just crap, its a great country to visit as a tourist but you will be SoL if you become victim of a crime 9/10 times they dont give a fuck.\nDefamation law over there dont care about facts only feelings if you will, meaning if you do something bad/illegal and i go around and tell everyone you did that you can sue me and win cus even tho what i said is real it dont matter cus i defamed you(corps and politicians fave law over there).\nFor more info just look it up im sure you can find a whole lot of stuff, but these 2 things are like one of the more well known.\n\n&gt; Nintendo is def one case of a Patent Troll..\n\n[ThomasGameDocs recently did a video](https://youtu.be/cbH9-lzx4LY?si=sru5zV92Uxgp4UjQ) on how Nintendo's lawsuits have been at times more to \"maintain the status quo\", so I definitely see the similarities between this case and previous ones.\n\nThey will be told prior to trial. Just not yet.\n\n&gt;In fairness, Nintendo is not supposed to reveal what specific patents until the actual case. They aren't just throwing out anything and seeing what would stick, they are just holding their evidence until trial, which is not common but not unheard of in cases like these.\n\nI'm not going to pretend to know specifics of Japanese legal system in and out, but what you've described is highly uncommon worldwide for any sort of lawsuit in a free country.\n\nThe whole media trope of \"surprise\" witnesses and evidence doesn't fly in free countries.\n\nThey will give the actual reasons in discovery of course- I meant announcing it *right now* is not required.\n\nBrother you aren’t allowed to disclose the patent until the case begins. They just sent a lawsuit. In Japan that can take weeks before they get it patents they infringed on. It is up the pocket pair to either let this go to court or settle instead\n\nHow can you settle a case before you know what it's about? That's just pure extortion\n\nSerious answer: this is an incredibly common legal tactic for patent disputes everywhere in the world.\n\n\nPatent law has two stages and the defendent is not required to be fully informed for Stage 1.\n\n\n* Stage 1: Nintendo versus Japan patent office (Palworld invited to watch.)\n\n\n* Stage 2: Japan patent office versus Palworld (paid for and argued by Nintendo.)\n\n\nJapan follows international patent law standards such as WIPO, WTO and even the Paris Convention from 1890-something (thanks Victor Hugo.) Unlike most criminal or civil trials, patent disputes are very fast and almost mathematical in action.\n\n\n\nFirst step is accuser + judge determining if the case has merit. The judge compares the offending product against the patent as written. The defendent observes. Judge decides if case is dismissed or proceeds. This happens so quickly the parties usually don't have time to sit down.\n\n\nNow is where settlement is most likely to happen. The first step doesn't cost much money or time, giant legal fees have not happened, discovery hasn't happened, finances have not been probed.\n\n\nSecond stage. Both sides present evidence. The accused cannot argue ignorance. Japan is a first-to-file system, meaning trade secrets, \"development\" work, \"industry knowledge\" don't work as defenders. Damages are almost always worked out by predetermined formulas. The best the accused can argue is the patent cannot be enforced against them specifically, but they cannot attack the patent. Result is they violated the patent but without penalty.\n\n\nThe basics is the patent exists. If the accuser can demonstrate the patent is violated, the defendent has nothing to argue. \n\n\nThe subtlety is the defendent can file a second separate lawsuit against the Japanese patent office to cancel the patent or invalidate some of the claims. This takes a long time and/or it's expensive.\n\nThat's a lot of business lawsuits in a nutshell. Scare them into settling due to the cost of going to court.\n\nWell yes, that's the fucking idea\n\nI am suing you for patent infringement\n\nCopyright infringement is one thing, but claiming patent infringement (and the existence of game design patents) is almost always predatory in game development.\n\nOr any software dev tbh. You can't patent vague concepts. You have to detail it. But somehow that's allowed in software.\n\nThe people approving these patents clearly know very little about games and thus have absolutely no idea how novel any of these ideas are (or aren't).\n\nAll tech patents are like this because the patent office is not equipped to deal with them.  They gave out a patent to LSI for a [doubly linked lists](https://patents.google.com/patent/US7028023B2/en) in 2002.  That data structure had existed for nearly 50 years (mid 1950s) when the patent was issued.\n\nIt also appears this [particular patent ratfucker](https://patents.google.com/?inventor=Ming-Jen+Wang) filed quite a few patents for technology and processes that already exist.\n\nThis may be why such a small number of patents are actually enforceable.\n\nHonestly, at this point, the patent office seems like a scam organisation. It accepts money for a service it is incapable of effectively rendering.\n\nI worked there for a year back in the early 2010s.\n\nThe backlog was YEARS long. The structure for junior examiners was to pump out as many case counts as you could to keep ahead of your work flow, often times without being able to fully research the existing art. Once you had a year or two of this flow, your older cases getting closed out or abandoned after their time expired would help tremendously in getting you your case counts for the week. But before you started to get those flowing in steadily, you were expected to be able to digest the claims in a new parent, research the existing art, and draft a refusal (because at least in my unit, everything got a denial at first) all in one day, and some of these applications had hundreds of pages of technical writing to support them that you could use to cite as prior existing art.\n\nIt didn't help that during my time there, in a training class of 20 some people, I was the ONLY one with actual work experience at the time, everyone else was a new grad. It's hard to know what is common use or what would be an obvious improvement in a field you've never worked in before.\n\nSounds like something poorly managed and, as I said, not fit for purpose. I genuinely feel for the people working there. They're just there to pay their bills, doing their best to get the job done under an impossible workload. \n\nConsidering that people are probably already using AI to help them draft patent applications, it makes sense for AI to be used (as a tool, not a replacement) to keep up with the flow and at least reject the most blatantly fraudulent applications.\n\n[deleted]\n\nNot being brought up to speed for current tech *is* being poorly managed, btw. \n\nPossibly not through much fault of their own, as so many regulatory agencies are funded at like 1970s levels, or actually below after being gutted over the years.\n\ni worked there for a year from 2023-2024 and came to the same conclusion\n\nAgreed.  Game play and tech patents outside of _maybe_ hardware should never have been a thing.  \n\nEven with hardware patents, if you go look at that guy's patents you'll see one in 2011 for \"SAS controller with persistent port configuration\" as if that's something that should ever be patentable.  SAS controllers already having existed for about 8 years at that point... I'm pretty sure there were controllers that already implemented that methodology.\n\nIt'd be like you, in 2024, patenting \"cooking a hot dog on a grill with high heat and metal tongs\".\n\nI’m on the side that they are needed, but are taken advantage of people who could just file for anything. Like most things in life, not everything is a default “good” or “bad” situation, it’s just how it gets treated. I’m probably guessing that there are some cases where this is justified, and not “Big Corp bullying the underdogs.”\n\nThey're needed but the last time I checked only 14% of patents were successfully defended in court.\n\nI put no value in a body whose decisions are overturned 86% of the time they're placed under the slightest bit of legal scrutiny.\n\nYup, one of my college professors for CS legal stuff was a patent lawyer and tried encouraging anyone to go down that route cause there were few subject experts leading to these absurd patents.\n\nAs it goes for many similar lawsuits. It’s like when the music copyright infringement shit goes to court; a judge who has never played an instrument or written a song will deem someone owns a rhythmic feel or chord progression.\n\nI would like to point out that there’s way more to it than just the plaintiff’s lawyers playing a clip of the two songs and going “See, your honor? They do sound alike, they’re clearly stealing our music!”. There’s a number of tests that the plaintiff’s attorneys must pass when presenting their case to a judge in order to have any hope of winning the case. \n\nThe best example I can give you is the whole debacle between Aquilah and Carl Benjamin, the latter used clips made by the former and would dissect and criticize her beliefs and viewpoints. Aquilah got pissed off and sued Benjamin, they went to court for “copyright infringement” and she lost spectacularly (to nobody’s surprise). \n\nDuring the trial they had to go through each and every video that Benjamin did about Aquilah (3 or 4 videos IIRC) and break them down to see if they passed certain tests in order to determine if Fair Use applies or not. I would imagine it’d be pretty similar for anyone attempting to argue that they own a chord progression or rhythm in court.\n\nI know how fair use cases work. There is more to it than that, but that doesn’t mean it works like it should. \n\nWith those music cases they usually break everything down on a theoretical level, but in a “miss the Forrest for the trees” kind of way.\n\nThey hyper analyze the similarities while ignoring that those similarities are very basic musical building blocks of entire genres and ignoring the greater context of how music works as a whole. \n\nJust take blues for example. The entire genre is built off about two chord progressions. Most songs have those same progressions, and that’s what makes it blues.\n\nSomeone might go and say, “hey, that guy’s blues song has the same progression and a similar melody as mine.” So they sue, explain how the chords are the same, and show how the melodies are only a couple notes and a slight rhythmic change away. And due to how the law’s written, they might actually win. \n\nBut that’s completely ignorant to how music works. Again, blues is built around those two progressions. There are only so many available good melodies within that harmonic framework, and similarities like that are inevitable. \n\nIt’s ultimately lawyers arguing with lawyers to a judge, most likely none of whom really know much about music, its history, or how it’s made. \n\nAdam Neely has a few videos on YouTube explaining the issue of these suits and music as IP in general on his channel. Just search Adam Neely copyright if you’re interested.\n\nI don't know why you're getting downvoted, this is literally true. A particularly egregious example is the Katy Perry Dark Horse lawsuit where a single vaguely similar synth ostinato was deemed similar enough to the song Joyful Noise to classify it as the same piece of music, despite containing entirely different melodies, chord progressions and arrangement. Not to mention, the synth itself and the actual notes *were* different. Adam Neely has a really good breakdown of this specific legal case.\n\nThe most ridiculous part, is that there is a finite combination of chord progressions that exist. Current laws ignore this. If we were to agree with the laws, we would be agreeing that very little new music was able to be created, eventually running out of all combinations(rhythm and melody). Then no new music could be created lol.\n\nIt's absolutely stupid.\n\nAt least all future melodies are sorted. Someone made them all.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1ZpVEn29Po\n\nFuck Carl.\n\nPatent examiners don't need to know anything about the stuff they review.\n\nI work in a niche agricultural industry where we regularly patent new strains to prevent our commercial competitors from stealing our R&amp;D. I've worked with an examiners office for over a decade now, and it's wild. These guys have a middle school understanding of biology, and we're trying to explain gene inheritance and probability to them.\n\nAt least in the US they pretend to understand. In the EU, it's even worse. Their attitude is that it isn't their job to understand anything. It's your job to write your patent in a way that it ticks every box on their generic and arbitrary checklist, and if that's impossible because the checklist was written before your technology was even invented, well that's tuff titties.\n\n\\*cough\\* Middle-Earth: Shadow of War/Mordor Nemesis system \\*cough\\*\n\nFuck you Warner Bros. One of the great new gaming systems and they fucking patented it.\n\n[deleted]\n\nThe developer is working on a Wonder Woman game that's supposed to use it but that was announced 3 years ago.\n\nBecause *that's* what everyone is dying for. An open world Wonder Woman game.\n\nLook, you don't go to WB for *good* ideas. You go to WB because they're holding many of your favorite IP hostage.\n\nHonestly, it's something new instead of a remake or something, so yeah I'm kinda dying for that. So long as it's good and they learned their lessons about microtransactions from shadow of war's launch (which they backtracked on completely) I'll be a happy man.\n\nAs long as they don't get Gal Gadot to voice her. Her naration in Justice League is still terrible.\n\nLike how Namco patented loading screen games during the PS1 era and then barely used it.\n\nAnd now we have SSDs with loading quick enough for most games to not matter\n\nWhich is a true shame. They don't even use it in their own games. Gotham Knights would have been the perfect opportunity to bring it back. Having actual villains using the Nemesis system would have been amazing.\n\nThis always makes me irrationally angry; I loved that system and it kept me playing through the game despite other things about it.\n\nJust a plain massive waste of an awesome system.\n\nI'm taking a \"wait and see\" approach. I may be way off base but I can't think of the last time Nintendo filed a lawsuit for patent infringement. They can certainly be litigious over their IP copyrights but I'm not sure I've ever heard of them going after another developer because of a patent before.\n\nThey went after a game company called colopl a few years ago for the joystick control using touchscreen patent\n\nTo be fair tho they went after them after colopl went after other companies that was infringing upon their patents\n\nThat's sort of my point...Nintendo rarely pushes patent lawsuits unless it's a sort of fair play situation. Iirc it's some sort of Japanese code of honor thing.\n\nOh yeah same as me with the wait and see approach, I might be going against the general circlejerk here but nintendo doesn't just throw frivolous suits especially within Japan where you need a strong case before it even reaches the court\n\nI wish we could see Nemesis System outside of Shadow of War...\n\nWarframe has done it. It’s allowed so long as you build your system from the ground up.\n\nWarframe version is very simplified, it doesn't have the relations or connections between Nemesis targets which is mostly what made the SoW/M version fun.\n\nIt's more of a reference than a copy\n\nSister of parvos and Kuva Lich?\n\nNot only are they predatory, but they are also bs.\nLike Nintendo owns patents on \n- throwing a ball to summon an ally\n- calling on allies to help fight or to interact with the environment \n\nLike that means that any games that have teammates (ai or player) are in violation of the patent. Its like trying to enforce a patent on the dodge mechanic.\n\naccording to [this video by Thomas Game Docs](https://youtu.be/cbH9-lzx4LY?si=aH3metatgACU_FzU) japanese game companies have regularly been patenting the absolute *crap* out of every single new game mechanic they can think of. \n\nHowever, in order to prevent game design from becoming a minefield of infringement that stifles creativity, they operated on an honor system - so long as you don't sue us for infringing on your patented game mechanic, we won't sue you for infringing on ours. That way everyone can build on each others' work. \n\nIt's like a patent cold war. Everybody makes as many patents as they can to protect themselves and if anybody breaks the code of honor and tries to enforce their patents, then they are hit with an entire patent library's worth of counter-lawsuits that Nintendo and Co. have been building since the 80s, like what happened to Colopl.\n\nSo with all that in mind...I wonder why Nintendo themselves have decided to seemingly break the code of honor, assuming Pocketpair haven't themselves tried to enforce patents on other companies? I guess they take special exception when it comes to Pokémon?\n\nknowing this you have to wonder if Nintendo even did the right thing in the long run, by changing this cold war in to a possible hot one.\n\nif nintendo wins others may see this as a good opportunity to also use their patent to make a quick buck, and nintendo themself could be the target for many of them\n\nI take it because Pocketpair had no patents I imagine, and Palworld has proven popular, Nintendo thought they could curb stomp Pocket and get away with it because they have nobody and nothing besides themselves.\n\ntfw they have nukes and you don't\n\nFromSoft could claim patent on so much stuff other souls like copy, but they don't so other games manage to improve those concepts and they feed back into FS games in the end (I am sure ER took some other SL games improvements)\n\nIt upsets me so much, game Mechanics, gameplay cna't be copyrighted, but patents in games work? It contradicts itself...\n\nPatents in software have always been extremely controversial. \n\nThr analogue from reality is you can only patent *an implemented process*. So you need to show the guts of the machine how it works. \n\nNot just the inputs/outputs. Your specific implementation of a machine gets a patent. You have to show every gear and switch. \n\nNot in software!\n\nYou just say “a system for playing games during a loading screen”. No code, no algorithms, nothing. \n\nIt’s completely nonsensical. \n\nIf you were forced to include source code…source code is already covered under copyright. \n\nTo add to this, lots of stuff in software is just applied math or physics. I've heard of some patent trolls doing the equivalent of patenting the Pythagorean Theorem or the formula to calculate the area of a circle.\n\nIt says a lot that Nintendo waited till Palworld cooled off in both sales and hype. It makes for an easier target.\n\nParents on game mechanics is lame as shit. Monolith patenting their Nemesis system was just selfish imo. We could have a bunch of games trying to incorporate persistent enemies but instead the idea is trapped in 2 old games. It's not doing anything but freezing the evolution of gaming just so they have the option of using it down the track. Lame if you ask me. Hope Palworld devs get the win. Nintendo doesn't need a win here.\n\nThe biggest issue with patents right now is how long they last. The current laws were made when innovation and technology progressed much more slowly.\n\n\nNow, though, things come and go very quickly. It makes no sense to be able to protect a game mechanic for 20+ years.\n\n\n2 years? Sure. I'd buy that.\n\nI'd be fine with the full term provided you use the patent.\n\n\nYou have 2 years to put that mechanic into the next game. Otherwise, it's public domain.\n\nI’d say if we go that route they’ll just release some stupid cheap phone game with the mechanic and keep it if they truly wanted to\n\nThis is how we got the Resident Evil movies\n\nAnd they would still have the option to implement the nemesis system down the road without the patent, it just potentially wouldn't be as interesting as what could've been made in the meantime. It's *patently* anti-competitive and it stifles creativity.\n\nMonolith is an interesting case because of their ownership by WBros, which probably explains some of their strategy with IP, but also seems like they seemed to have pivoted to building tools and engines anyways. So it would seem they would want to license out their IP anyways.\n\nVanguard patented a way for their customers to save money on taxes. No joke. Was shocked it was ever approved. IMO should never have been approved: [https://www.investopedia.com/how-vanguard-patented-a-system-to-avoid-taxes-in-mutual-funds-4686985](https://www.investopedia.com/how-vanguard-patented-a-system-to-avoid-taxes-in-mutual-funds-4686985)\n\nFor someone who doesn't play these types of games. What would a persistent enemy be? How does that work in a way that wouldn't be like every other enemy?\n\nI really hate how patent and copyright law forces companies to be extremely litigious and aggressive with these lawsuits. You have a company sitting on an IP and letting it rot, and then making sure that no one else can make good games either. I really hope Nintendo loses this because it's patently ridiculous. I don't get why this game is a nono but something like Dragon Quest Monsters is somehow fine either.\n\nPatents and copyrights don’t really serve their intended purpose anymore; it used to be about rewarding innovative individuals for coming up with new ideas. Now it’s just used by corporations as a cock-blocking tactic to create mini-monopolies legally, and the actual individuals who came up with these ideas receive absolutely nothing.\n\nIt’s a really scummy system.\n\nCopyright is simply too long. Patents for software need to be more rigorous. \n\nPatents and copyrights DO protect smaller entities but the processes around them need to change. \n\nBlowing up IP law means indies would never even be able to exist. \n\nThat's generally incorrect, you don't lose copyrights or patents just because you don't defend them. You might be thinking of trademarks, which can be lost if you don't prevent its use by others.\n\nThat said, this is in Japan so that's not necessarily the case, but a bit of Googling suggested that part is the same.\n\nIt doesn't actually require it though. That's an idea pushed pretty much solely by Nintendo's lawyers. Look at Sonic: hundreds of fan games that Sega knows about, sometimes even endorses, and then they hire some of the creators. They're at zero risk of losing the Sonic IP. \n\nOn brand for Nintendo. They once tried to prove that video games DO promote violence IRL because all of Nintendo competition were making lots of money selling those types of video games.\n\nAh yes\n\n\"Donkey kong will remain a lovable ape, Link will never lose hope, and, of course, Mario will never start shooting hookers\"\n\nNintendo, e3 2003\n\nOne of those is not like the other\n\nWhat the fuck, [that's an actual quote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emK1fd4tbOQ).\n\nSo that's why Robot Chicken made that Grand Theft Auto Mario/Luigi skit.\n\nWhere can i read about this?\n\nThe US Senate Hearing on Violence in Video Games in the mid 90s; the thing that forced the creation of the ESRB. Nintendo \\*violently\\* threw SEGA under the bus by mentioning that they kept blood in the Genesis version of Mortal Kombat.\n\n&gt; patently ridiculous.\n\nha\n\nSomeone correct me if im wrong, but when Palworld was first coming out and everyone was saying \"nintendo is going to sue them\", did Nintendo not come out and say they had reviewed the game already and found nothing, or did that only pertain to copyright stuff?\n\nEdit - So it was the Pokémon company that made a statment. When Palworld dropped they made a statement saying they were looking into palworld already, investigating any infringement of intellectual property rights related to Pokémon. This is most likely unrelated to the current lawsuit issued by Nintendo.\n\nAll the coverage I saw was a super vague response \"like we will defend our IP etc etc and are aware of the IP but we won't take action at this time\".. https://www.gamesradar.com/the-pokemon-company-appears-to-break-silence-over-palworld-we-intend-to-investigate-and-take-appropriate-measures-to-address-any-acts-that-infringe-on-intellectual-property-rights/\n\nNintendo didn’t say anything at all. They were busy reviewing with counsel whether they had a case. \n\nTurns out they do.\n\n&gt; Turns out they **think they** do.\n\nFTFY. Until it's before a judge and moves forward, it's not a sure done deal.\n\nSony announcing a joint venture to expand Palworld IP definitely has nothing to do with it. Sony having their own Pokémon is not at all a problem for Nintendon't\n\nWasn't there a thing that Sony wouldn't actually be involved with the game side of things? I remember it turned out the deal was with Sony Music or something, not Playstation.\n\nCompanies say one thing and do something completely opposite for profits all the time. I bet Nintendo knows that\n\nNot just Sony, Microsoft too I believe. And I see both those companies being interested in defending their investments. So Sony and Microsoft their legal teams will likely get involved. That makes it a lot harder for Nintendo to just bully Palworld out of existence. Mostly because either one of those companies is already a lot bigger than Nintendo.\n\nIf true then only winners in that case are the lawyers, losers being us consumers, alternative however is pocketpair and gamers being losers\n\nMicrosoft already has its own Pokemon adjacent IP and they won't do a damn thing with it.\n\nViva Pinata deserves to come back.\n\nHey listen buddy, I got good memories of Viva Pinata too, but to say it's an adjacent IP to fucking Pokemon is a pretty big swing.\n\nA new Viva Piñata would be real cool right now.\n\nThis sub in a Palworld thread: Fuck Nintendo!\nThis sub in a thread about the new Switch: Hook it into my veins!\n\nI love Nintendo's products. I don't love them as a company.\n\nI mean, Nintendo makes great games. They just don't make good Pokemon games because they get $$$ no matter what from Pokefans\n\nDefinitely on the side of Palworld on the whole patenting game mechanics thing. It's however hard to side completely with them when they so blatantly ripped off the designs of their monsters.\n\nImagine if dark souls just fucked every other game that came out like there’s, there’s literally a genera of games called “souls like” because of how much the just copy the core mechanics of the parent companies game and imo dark souls doesn’t give a shit I’m sure the love seeing how people take there game and ideas and create something new out of them, for a huge company like this to just start suing cuz of similar game mechanics is just flat out bullying\n\nWell if the idea was an original but it’s not.\n\nLet's be real, even if Nintendo is justified in doing this 99.9% of people will take the side of whoever goes against Nintendo by default lmao\n\nEven if Nintendo has patents for this, they'll never actually be justified. Patents for game design concepts should simply never be granted. Nintendo is the villain here regardless of legalities.\n\nYeah if Nintendo sets precedent here, they hurt the entire industry. It'd be sad for the ones who helped build it to be the one to start kicking it down.\n\nThey aren't the ones setting the precedent, Monolith and WB have set a precedent that yes, you can patent unique game systems. \n\nIf Pocketpair somehow wins this they will be overturning existing precedent in the games industry, which would be a good thing, but makes this a more uphill battle.\n\nI’m really confused at how someone could look at just the monsters on the cover of palworld and mot realize how blatantly they disregarded the copyright and stole from pokemon. The lawsuit itself is about patents likely because its the most effective way their lawyers found to shut down a game obviously stealing from them.\n\nNAL and related question:\n\n\nIs proof of harm required in a Software development patent suit?\n\n\nI could see where certain inventions developed intentionally vague/broad would have some overlap (pokeballs, for example), but my thought is the crime is victimless to me as a layperson given the markets have very little overlap with Pokemon only available on proprietary hardware, while Palworld is exclusively on discrete hardware.\n\n\nWould the case/monetary sentencing be made that Palworld hurt hardware sales, or just unit sales of the franchise? If neither, what would guide judgement regarding a guilty verdict's fine/award?\n\n[deleted]\n\nIs this the international standard? I know this case is being heard under the Japanese legal system.\n\nNintendo isn't stupid. If they waited this long to take them to court, when very early on they acknowledged Palworld's existence, they probably have a really tight case. It could be something minor to us fans, but it makes a difference behind the scenes. Nintendo knows how to protect their IPs. I think this won't be pretty.\n\nThe game may be fun. But its not exactly creatively unique. Its basically Ark. Its just another open world survival with animal taming mechanics.\n\nPeople want to deny it, but it got popular off the back of people memeing it about being Pokemon with guns. If that never happened, much less people would have played it, even if it is a good game.\n\nI am really curious what is actually the patent their are suing them for, because as you and others say, Palworld is much much more similar to ARK than to Pokémon.\n\nThe only thing that comes to mind are the Pal Spheres. And if they are going to argue that \"throwing round objects at fictional animals to capture them\" is a patentable kontext then it's going to be hilarious lawsuit.\n\n&gt; And if they are going to argue that \"throwing round objects at fictional animals to capture them\" is a patentable kontext then it's going to be hilarious lawsuit.\n\nYou'd be surprised what CAN be Patented. Just as another example, Sega literally has a Patent on Corkscrew-Loops in Sonic Games.\n\nAs well as that big arrow in the top center of your screen in racing games telling you where to head, such as in Crazy Taxi, IIRC.\n\nOh yes, we should really not discourage this indie developer from pursuing their ideas. Like the idea of copying the artstyle and/or gameplay from other successful indie developers ([Hollow Knight,](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2395770/Never_Grave_The_Witch_and_The_Curse/?curator_clanid=41648656) [JackBox](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2154230/AI_Art_Impostor/?curator_clanid=41648656)).\n\nI think the discourse around this is absolutely fucking stupid.\n\nPalworld comes out - \"I bet Nintendo is going to sue them\"\n\nNintendo sues them - \"What I am so shocked Nintendo is awful!\"\n\nIf you THOUGHT NINTENDO WAS GOING TO SUE THEM, then you saw a similarity. If almost everyone who looked at Palworld thought Nintendo was going to sue them over it, maybe Nintendo isn't the problem here.\n\n[deleted]\n\nNot that I want Nintendo to win but I don't understand why these devs couldn't at least think of a concept different than the pokeball, on top of the similarities of the creature designs.\n\nI think this is an interesting lawsuit. On one hand, Pocket Pair is correct that a large company can't just sue and walk over small developers because of a similar idea or expanding on an idea in a different way.\n\nOn the other hand, imo this company is shitty. They steal ideas from other games and make their own games that are extremely similar as a cash grab. Look up their other games and see a large variety of art styles emulating other games, as well as mechanics. \n\nThis company has been in the sights of a lawsuit for the past 5 years.\n\nPocketPair are definitely ones to talk about \"indies pursuing ideas\" because it seems pretty clear all their ideas are someone else's\n\nSee they started by [ripping off Clash Royale](https://store.steampowered.com/app/919370/Overdungeon/?curator_clanid=41648656), then they went and [ripped off Breath of the Wild](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1307550/Craftopia/?curator_clanid=41648656), then they went for [ripping off Jackbox Drawful](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2154230/AI_Art_Impostor/?curator_clanid=41648656) (bonus points for being based on AI image generation by the way. love the inclusion of the ripoff software), then they wrapped around to ripping off Pokemon. *Oh no wait, sorry, it's actually ripping off ARK. That's better because shut up.* And in case you thought they were done, [they're currently in the process of ripping off Hollow Knight.](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2395770/Never_Grave_The_Witch_and_The_Curse/?curator_clanid=41648656)\n\nI'll give you credit for pursuing ideas when you... uh... actually have one.\n\nI knew of craftopia but jesus fucking christ the hollow knight one is so fucking similair yet they still have the balls to act like innocent smol indie company\n\nRelease a DLC with some useless rewards inside and label it as Lawsuit Donation. I bet that it will print a lot of money 😏\n\nIll get crucified for not going \"duur Nintendo bad\" but ya'll are way to eager to ride PocketPairs wang. Its CEO is absolutely a weirdo. He literally believes \"theres no such thing as originality\" and thinks you should be able to just take other peoples ideas and designs freely. \n\nHe's the Japanese game-dev equivalent of those \"Libertarian Americans\" who think the world should work on \"survival of the fittest\" rules and not pay taxes or obey the law. \n\n\"Don't care small indie vs billionaire company\" and yet PocketPair goes and rips off Hollow Knight with \"Never Grave\". Ya know a game from a small (smaller than PocketPair) studio that just happened to be a smash hit. \n\nHe's got the artistic and creative integrity of a wet paper bag, who had his company just copy whatever was trending, or mash together two trending games, and threw it at the wall until one stuck. \n\nBut again no one here gives a fk that PocketPair isn't some innocent little indie who genuinely cares about the industry. No no cause they're opposing evil ole Nintendo they're the ones in the right. \n\nI don't believe game companies should be able to patent mechanics like say Nemesis system is, but I don't think people should support a company whose modus operandi is creative bankruptcy\n\nI can get behind that .\n\nI'm not 100% happy about the concept of patenting gameplay mechanics (although I'm not as dead against it as a lot of people seem to be - it's not that simple) but I also have a hard time with the developers of Palword, of all games, positioning themselves as defenders of invention in game development.\n\n\nPalword is a pretty transparent attempt at a Pokémon clone and the things that it does add are concepts lifted from other existing games.\n\n\nPalword is as cynically commercial and uncreative an endeavour as you are likely to get and I'm honestly not particularly keen to come to their defence on this one. The only ideas in Palword are \"what if we combined these multiple profitable concepts together and made our own profits\"."

In RDR1 it was even easier, just run up the pot and go all in and everyone folds. In RDR2 just slowly run up the pot and go all in with a good hand, or fold if you don’t get good hands immediately. \n\nDominos seemed more luck based, blackjack was almost pure luck. Even having a blackjack chart open on a second monitor which is supposed to give you the best strategy depending on your hand and dealers face card was a crapshoot.\n\nI miss being able to hide a card up my sleeve like in RDR1\n\nsame i don't know how that's not a thing in the second one.\n\nThey seem to have significantly toned down gambling from RDR1 to RDR2. I heard it’s because they don’t want people gambling and then ending up broke and then the whole story they worked toward making money only to have the end game ruined because they’re out of cash. But in RDR2 you can make so much money and even buying all the outfits and guns and max ammo you have so much left over you have nothing to spend it on.\n\nIt’s a recurring Rockstar Games issue. The game ends and there’s nothing to spend the money on.\n\n&gt; The game ends and there’s nothing to spend the money on.\n\nThere's a lesson in there, I think. Even if it was unintentional.\n\n[deleted]\n\nI just personally adjust how I approach it, like I act as though all that cash is really only available once that final mission is done.\n\nExcept GTA V. I didn't do the Lester missions in some round about way so I can't afford to purchase most of the available properties after \"The Big Score\".\n\nMaybe someone can mod that in but only have the option available if below a certain honor or the like.\n\nShark cards (gold in RD2), can't be letting people have fun, especially if there's a chance shark card sales my be affected \n\nTbf even playing mathematically perfect blackjack (short of counting cards) you should still expect to be at a disadvantage compared to the house. Playing optimally just reduces their advantage against you.\n\nThe best blackjack players at casinos are thought to be playing with a 51% chance to win on the house in terms of quantity of wins vs losses (not value loss). But they also know when to bet large and when to bet small, so when they win they earn a lot more than the average person as well.\n\nIf you play blackjack perfectly, then the house edge for traditional games is 0.5%\n\nThe only way to gain an actual advantage against the house in blackjack is by card counting\n\n&gt;The only way to gain an actual advantage against the house in blackjack is by card counting\n\nAnd to be clear, you're still going to lose more often than you win overall. However, by better larger when the deck is hot, you can win more money than you lose.\n\nYour gambling strategy alone gives you away though. Casinos can review the video and count the cards just like you would, see that you vary your bets at the right time, and you're easily caught.\n\nI still don't understand why counting cards is wrong, it's literally just being good at the game.\n\nIt’s not illegal or wrong just casinos hate losing money so they don’t like advantage players\n\nIt's not 'wrong.' Counting cards isn't a crime anywhere, casinos just remove card counters because they cause the house to lose money on average, which obviously is not good for a casino.\n\nThere are some states where it's illegal to kick people out for card counting, but if you're suspected of it in those states they'll just freeze you out in another way (like by suddenly placing a very low max bet limit on your table specifically to throttle how much you can make)\n\nHence why card counters typically don't go solo (like the MIT team that inspired the movie '21'). They have a couple of team mates who'll card count and keep playing until the deck is stacked. \n\nThen they'll signal one of their friends to show up - who'll come in with the big bets.\n\nMakes sense, black jack is pure luck if you're playing basic strategy. Whole thing just makes you think it's skill based.\n\nI mean, that’s generally the strat in actual poker too lol.\n\n...\n\nI fold\n\nThat’s how I feel about The Witcher 3 and Gwent. I’m such a sucker for any kind of card game within a game lol\n\nGod I love pazaak\n\nPazaak is not for everyone – it requires both nerve and skill. Perhaps you should practice before risking your credits against such a skilled player as myself. Heh heh heh. Unless you like losing?\n\nI like gambling in games where I can load a game directly before I lost if I lose.\n\nI like games like red dead where when i lose i can blast all those cheating bastards with a shotgun.\n\nI once went all in with an *obscenely* good hand.  The AI busts out the same hand, but king high to my queen.\n\n...A **lot** of people died that day.\n\nHaha yea that would have sent me on a spree too. \nWhat makes it better is the shit talking the npcs do too lol. But I swear blackjack is far worse then poker. Im surprised they can find new dealers when the last 100 have died on the job.\n\nI always thought pazaak didn’t have any real strategy or rules until I got old enough to understand blackjack. Now it’s a guilty pleasure of mine when I boot these up.\n\nI was really bummed that SWTOR never got playable Pazaak.\n\nI would still be playing SWTOR if it did\n\nSame... seems like such a huge missed opportunity they could have charged for card packs and such instead of just more vanity items which dont interest me but i would throw money at pazaak card packs all day long..\n\nI’ve always heard that MMOs need to be careful with adding gambling adjacent mini games. I think they just stay from the topic entirely just in case.\n\nAh thats a good point there are probably international laws they have to consider.\n\nThey had planned to, but shied away for as likely a reason.  The one artifact that hints at it is the gambling table at the beginning of the Esseles mission.  It looks like it should be interactable, but does nothing.\n\nI was just about to redownload SWTOR last week after years away. I convinced myself that I shouldn't dive down that rabbit hole again.\n\nIt was so fun and I miss it. But I know I'll just subscribe for a few months and then leave for a few more years.\n\nI'd love a 2024 SWTOR... le sigh. Still not getting my Star Wars kicks from anywhere.\n\nYah just the slot machines.\n\nStar Wars Galaxies had some other casino games but the stakes were pretty low IIRC.\n\nGod I miss SWG so much, I only played a little but I watched my dad go the whole 9 yards\n\nSWG Infinity, go ahead and play, I do.\n\nPure Pazaak!\n\nThere used to be an application for windows that was just the pazaak part of the game.\n\nstill a thing https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9nblggh4nfz8?hl=en-US&amp;gl=US\n\ndang i think i have to load up my game and play some now\n\nOh my God. I played so much pazaak it was ridiculous.\n\nTriple Triad fans unite!\n\nOne of my favorite things about FF14 is playing Triple Triad and collecting the cards.\n\nUntil\n\nPlus\n\nPlus\n\nPlus\n\nCombo\n\nYeah that's the worst! And so many NPCs have illegal decks, it's frustrating.\n\nBut they aren't great at adapting, so you just have to build your deck around what their deck is.\n\nForget that, if I can't use my scion beat down deck, what's even the point?\n\nI was the same way with FF8. I spent way too much time converting monsters into cards and cards into resources, lol.\n\nIt was an actually legitimately neat card game with regional rules which added some weird and interesting modifiers and you could even make different regions adopt or drop different rules. And like you said bonus resources.\n\nAccidentally spreading the random draw rule around was save-wipe worthy.\n\nHonestly, yeah. Lmfao\n\nOh, most definitely. I also had fun tracking down the players who owned rare cards that you could only get from beating them. The whole concept of an ante system was a blast. Granted I did tend to save scum if I lost, ha ha.\n\nThis exactly! Kind of makes you overpowerd and makes the game too easy though.\n\nExceot the rare cards, held onto those like they were gold, even if they sucked.\n\nIt was my favorite part of FF8 (least being the draw system) and I enjoyed it even more in FF9.\n\nThe Draw system seemed really cool at first but, in practice, only made magic useful as a stat-booster and not as an actual method of attack.  If I used Firaga a bunch of times in a fight I would then have to go find more to reboost whatever stat it was linked to.\n\nThat's why you have items you can refine.\n\nThe only reason I played FF8 as a kid, challenge everyone to TT and get all the cards. I barely remember the story, just triple triad\n\nSomething about they went to an academy to play Triple Triad against other academies. Occasionally they fought monsters for course credits.\n\nI love the card game in FF7R2\n\nPersonally prefer Tetra Master myself.\n\nThe true endgame of FF14! No seriously if you want get all the cards you have to pretty much do everything in the game. And I wanted to do it just because Triple Triad itself is so much fun.\n\nNeed triple triad in GTA vi. Scouring the huge map looking under every nook and cranny for cards would be a collectable search I would 100%\n\nEven Caravan?\n\n*Especially* Caravan.\n\n[deleted]\n\nI was so proud of myself when I beat Johnson Nash. I knew I'd fucked up challenging him when he calmly said \"If you think you got it in ya.\"\n\nInsanity\n\nThe longest save I had on that game was from me just looking for cards to tweak my caravan deck.\n\n\"Has anyone seen my adoptive daughter?  Yay tall, ash grey hair, scar on her eye?  Probably the most powerful being in existence?  No.  Okay.  Who wants to play gwent?\n\nOther than Final Fantasy 9's card game.\n\nI *still* don't understand how to play it...\n\nbut Triple Triad is the GOAT.\n\nI spend so much time in 14 collecting cards and playing Triple Triad.\n\n&gt;Other than Final Fantasy 9's card game.\n\nTetra master was just a different beast, when I figured out combos I was killing it\n\n[Should tried the Poker Night games when they were still around](https://youtu.be/SemZVn57naw?si=0NO1I7oCslGKWKNY)\n\nPirating the files online is the only way to play the game but it's very easy to do so with some common sense and Google fu\n\nI have them on Steam.  They are fun but the dialogue starts to loop after a very short time and the AI is a bit dumb.  If you play conservatively every other player but one will bust out within 10 minutes so you end up stuck with the one good player that has their AI flipping through optimal strategies and repeating the same few anecdotes over and over.\n\nMy man, you need some Balatro and Slay the Spire in your life.\n\nKingdom come and the dice game!\n\nI was pretty alright at that game, and then I found out about the [loaded dice](https://kingdom-come-deliverance.fandom.com/wiki/Dice) you can find.  Holy hell, did I ever cheat a lot of people.\n\nYeahhhh Farkle is my jam, had to buy a set irl it was so good\n\nShame that the official Gwent game sucks that much.\n\nThe problem is the Witcher 3 Gwent is not balanced for PvP. It's too simple and designed for the player to be able to run away with games in a way that's not fun in multiplayer.\n\nRight. So give me that single player standalone so I can have fun on my own.\n\nThronemaker is a singleplayer gwent game if I remember correctly.\n\nIt's very very very different from what W3s Gwent is. Doesnt scratch the same itches so to speak.\n\nNever understood why digital card games seem to be completely allergic to singleplayer modes.\n\nBecause the content can be consumed very quickly and is hard to design. PvP gives people a reason to keep replaying the same content over and over and let’s designers focus on balance instead of encounters\n\nthere's balatro.\n\nAnd I love it for that.\n\nLegends of Runeterra has a single player campaign.\n\nThey made two single player Gwent games I believe.\n\nThronebreaker is great, 20 hours rpg game\n\nYeah, and they could even build a whole story around it set in the Witcher universe. Maybe they could call it, \"Thronebreaker,\" or something. \n\nI was so pumped to jump back into Gwent after finishing the Witcher 3 only to realize they somehow made it unfun.\n\nIt used to be really good in beta but they ruined it\n\nit's not pvp, and very much catered towards the narrative, but thronebreaker was a lot of fun\n\nFallout NV caravan &lt;3\n\nExcept for Caravan in Fallout New Vegas. I still have no idea how to play that damn game.\n\nBy Witcher 3 do you mean Gwent Simulator?\n\nI’m a sucker for sports games within shooters. Put a ton of hours into grifball in halo and Lucio ball in overwatch\n\nThis is why I can barely get through any RPG now but I already have over 100 hours in Balatro.\n\nLike 50% of my playtime was poker and domino.\nRest was just hunting, fishing and admiring the views. Story mission was about 5% or so.\n\n[deleted]\n\nWhen I lost I just gambled more lol.\nI must win eventually, no?\n\nWell you know what they always say, most gamblers quit right before they hit it big!\n\nWhenever I lost, I just shot the other players. Needless to say, my Arthur was a sore loser lol.\n\ndoubling up after each loss is called a 'martingale' strategy and no it is a bad idea, after a few losses you are betting hundreds/thousands just to break even.\n\nTechnically you're guaranteed to gain money, provided you can bet an arbitrarily large amount.\n\n\"Double down double down\" - the old Chinese guy next to me playing blackjack who went from losing $300 a round to $600 a round\n\nSo you should triple up instead? \n\nAfter a certain point the debt is really more of their problem anyway.\n\n&gt;then just went to the valentine bar to brawl it out\n\nAfter I beat up the \"raccoon hat guy\" in Valentine, I stole his hat, hog-tied him, put him on my horse, and then rode him up to the to top of Mt. Shann.  Cut him loose and then I took off.  I didn't see him again for a long time.\n\nThen when I did see him again in Valentine, I'd put on his raccoon hat, after which he immediately became angry and would attack me.\n\nRDR2 is such an amazing game with the freedom of things you can do.\n\nOne of the few still lesser known lore elements of RDR2 is that Jon the Trapper is a practical doppelganger for the in-universe character Josiah Blackwater (founder of... you can guess). They have led almost the same life and have exactly the same personality (sources: Valentine tent movie on Josiah Blackwater, Jon the Trapper's drunken tirades about himself).\n\nJosiah had a pet opposum that he loved more than anything in the world, that he skinned and turned into a hat after it died, so he could keep his buddy with him forever.\n\nThis implies Jon has an identical relationship with the raccoon hat. And Jon's hat is the only 'stealable' hat in the game which remains missing from the NPC after being taken by Arthur/Marston.\n\ni.e. **You're taunting Jon with the corpse and face of his beloved pet every time he sees you wearing it.** 🙂\n\nI’m redownloading this game right now because of this statement\n\nThis. NPC's remembering shit you do to them and calling you out on it later. Amazing and hilarious.\n\nSame, about 80% hunting, 10% poker, 5% getting dripped out, 5% main story.\n\nI am always way too focused on steamrolling storylines in games… I need to go back and play RDR2 again but really just embrace the role playing as a cowboy gameplay because I feel like I missed so much.\n\nI recently did. Beat the campaign in like 50 hours after rushing through it. Reinstalled a few months ago and have put 100 hours in and I'm still in act 2 exploring and hunting and completing challenges\n\nAs it should be!\n\nIm in epilogue 2, with 250hrs in... Still got several things to do. \n\nWill not attempt the Gambler Challenges, unless to do for fun here and there\n\nI would seriously start the game excited to unfold a certain story and realize I'd just spent 3 hours playing poker and needed to go to bed without advancing any story at all 😅\n\nThis was me LAST NIGHT. I’m such a story person I love following a story in game. \n\n3 hours of poker and hunting later I’ve done nothing for the story. 😂\n\nFishing and hunting for the money to kickstart your gambling career.\n\nI hope there is gambling gta 6 story mode the fact casino was exclusive to online is a crime\n\nThere was no fun way to earn or spend money in single player after a while. I hope they will change that in VI.\n\nUnless they change the economy of the singleplayer mode so that you‘re forced to buy shark cards i doubt that will happen. \n\nThey want you to continue to spend money so funneling people into online after they finished the story is the most realistic outcome nowadays.\n\n&gt; Unless they change the economy of the singleplayer mode so that you‘re forced to buy shark cards i doubt that will happen. \n\nChrist, don't give them ideas.\n\nLol I'm already prepared for it to be an MMO-lite that will need to be always online and have the economy tied into the online. Any progress you make in SP will probably be slow and they'll justify your character being broke as part of the story or something.\n\nMaybe I'm wrong, but Shark cards were a huge surprise for them with how profitable they were, so odds are they designed the entire in game economy around something like that. I really doubt it'll be able to be played offline, and you can bet that cheats and crap are going away too.\n\nSure it's an open-world game... but eventually the story comes to an end and there's just not much left to do. Rockstar has always done a really good job at making the world really vibrant and alive with tons of side quests and stuff. I'd expect 6 to be their biggest single player experience yet.\n\nBut at the end of the day, yes I'm sure they'll want to repeat the success of GTA5's online, as that ended up being the far bigger cash cow. I dunno tho, I never got into GTA online. When I tried it, it was already long in the tooth, and bots were rampant and 90% of the servers I was just getting insta killed by people with god level vehicles. Might be fun to get in on that from the start this time around.\n\nyou can invest in stocks and do the assassination missions to get nearly unlimited money. enough to buy everything in singleplayer.\n\nI personally loved this insider trading aspect of the single player.\n\nGTA has soured on me with their treatment of GTA 5. Added all this awesome content that is only accessible in their cancerous online environment. None of the new cars in single player, none of the new clothing or weapons, none of the new play options. It’s outright abysmal and I fear for what we get with GTA 6.\n\nSame with Red Dead.\n\nNothing from online has gone into the base game. Never got DLCs.\n\nExcellent single player that has so much more potential.\n\nI'd pay for DLCs too.\n\nAt least on PC, there are mods that port online stuff to singleplayer. Clothing, weapons, someone even ported the whole moonshiner role from online. And it fits so good to chapter 3.\n\nAnd the online casino was blocked on my country lol\n\nYep, us Portuguese can't have any fun. Luckily you could still play it with a vpn.\n\nGta6 online is going to launch with a subscription. I can sense it.\n\nI know this is RDR, but this visual makes me miss the old poker game called \"PKR\", where you could design a 3D avatar, and play in 3D environments, do emotes while sitting at the tables and stuff. Loved that game so much, and it just disappeared suddenly several years ago, never to be heard of again.\n\nI love virtual poker games, but I kinda hate the dull and basic \"top down\" view they all have. I wish there was something like PKR again.\n\nFor me the best part of RDR poker is seeing the other players varied avatars.\n\nI really do enjoy that aspect of it. As someone who plays a lot of poker IRL, though, the poker is excruciatingly slow for each action due to the animations and whatnot. It would be nice if it was a bit more fluid.\n\nIt's fun, the only unrealistic part is that RDR2 is set in 1899 and Texas hold em was not invented until 1905.\n\nThis is RDR we're talking about though. The only really \"realistic\" part of the game is the lovingly programmed horse balls.\n\nMaybe Prominence Poker can scratch that itch for you.\n\nYeah I tried it, and it is indeed the closest I found, but it's not quite the same \"vibe\" though.\n\nthere are some VR gambling games too\n\nProminence is good but fuck their algorithm is absolute dogshit. The table literally picks someone and then gives them the best cards for like 5 hands straight and then just alternates its favorite players\n\nPKR was amazing fun! I had all my Counter-Strike clan homies playing that shit with me and it was a blast. Right down to the little animations you could do like rolling a chip through your fingers. So awesome. Sucks they got rid of it.\n\nI played that PKR to death\n\nPKR was the bomb 🔥\n\n/chicken\n\nTheres vegas infinite by pokestars. It's vr only tho, it's about the closest you'll get to what your describing.\n\nDidn't recognize the screenshot at first and thought there's no way poker night at the inventory is 120gbs\n\nSame with far cry 3 and watch dogs (in watch dogs you can cheat by hacking the cameras)\n\nWatch Dogs also had chess puzzles, which is addicting\n\nHuh? When did they add poker to the fishing game?\n\ndont you mean the hunting game?\n\nEvery try playing this online against other players. Its non stop ALL IN every single hand.\n\nI mean, that's generally what happens when there isn't real money at stake in gambling games; people just yolo every turn.\n\nEasy to win money then\n\nFriendly for fun poker or real gambling poker?\n\nReal gambling for fake money in Red Dead Online.\n\nOnly if you can stay alive long enough before a hacker blows you up or someone sets you on fire\n\nRight on man 👍\n\nThe first Red Dead poker was so much fun, obviously you could just kill people at the table after you lost.  It was amazing.\n\nRDR2 as well. Thats what those bastards get for calling my bluff\n\nJust FYI the poker in this game is not good to play. The AI cheats so people can't make super easy money.\n\nThis is online, so all human players.\n\nI wish you could sit down with friends and make big bets like you can with strangers. I know some people will say it would be too easy to just give people money but who cares at this point. $5 just isn't high stakes enough for us.\n\nAh.\n\nThe AI cheats? Every time I play poker in RDR2 I bust out the whole table. I might have to buy on once or twice because I always easy my way into an all in, but I never thought they cheated, or at least it wasn’t obvious to me.\n\neven if that's the case, in single player i think you cant bet as much as you want, so it will take hours of grind even if you find a flaw in the algorithm. you can buy everything and still have a few thousands left, with no actual value, grinding money isn't the point of the game (for you, for Dutch I guess it is)\n\nCheats in your favour sometimes too (single player). I’ve been playing poker for years and never had a royal flush but I’ve had one multiple times in the game.\n\nI've won a good chunk of the games I played though. I never felt like the AI was all that unfair.\n\nMe with yakuza and mahjong.\n\nI wish they had liars dice too, that was fun\n\nman this poker game came with a free open world sandbox, sweet\n\nNight at the inventory still gets usage in my library\n\nSame with me and Gta 5.\n\nVirtual Casino and alot of jobs to do so i can save up for those sweet rides which gonna sit in garages forever...\n\nI played more liars dice in RDR on the x360 than I care to admit\n\ndoes anyone know any good poker games on PC thats not RDR?\n\nI don't know about \"good\", I'm not a huge poker snob so don't kill me if it isn't, but I got Poker Night at the Inventory for dirt cheap at one point and enjoyed it. I apparently own the sequel too but I have never installed it, so I have no opinion of that one but the Steam rating is \"very positive\" for both.\n\nAs a bonus, even the second one should basically run on a potato; the recommended specs are a Core 2 Duo CPU and at least 1 GB of GPU RAM...\n\nNot sure if it's just me, but I feel like the bots in poker night 2 are way tougher to beat. Great game though\n\nReal online poker. You can play for free with playmoney or freeroll tournaments.\n\n*Belatro* is incredible.  Though it's a deck-builder that uses poker mechanics, not true poker\n\nB**a**latro*\n\nDefinitely a blast but I wouldn't really call it poker.\n\nThe Minigames on the DS of New Super Mario, I think I have 3x more playtime on Luigi's casino than the main game itself\n\nShit. This might be the post for me to finally install RDR2.  I was just thinking I'd love a great atmospheric poker game to relax with after work.\n\nI still load up Kingdom Come: Deliverance every once in a while to play farkle.\n\nyes but this is a poker game where you can get up and shoot cheaters in the face, or literally drag them thru the mud\n\n\"I want to keep playing my RDR2 file, make some real progress\" load file, realize im in Saint Denis, walk into the bar grab a steak dinner, shot of whiskey and 2 beers. Greet some folks then sit at the poker table for an hour. \n\nAtleast 5 times this has happened over the past 5 years. I still haven't beaten this game. \n\nSteak poker boss gets me every time.\n\nStill bogged down by slow locked-in animations like the rest of the game.\n\nI got a 30gig shogi Sim. I don't even know how to play shogi!\n\nI always have a Yakuza game installed just to play koikoi\n\nI would just play poker for hours in this game.  I wish the multiplayer was more active with people. I used to love the games in RDR also.  I do wish the single player in RDR2 had the whole cheating minigame though.\n\nYes! I only play poker on RDR anymore and when I lose, I murder everyone. Which is often."

Truly revolutionary!\n\nSo we finally reached Fight Night on 360 levels of details? lol\n\nFight Night on the 360 was one of the few games that, when released, I actually remember thinking \"wow, I've never seen a game that looks this good\"\n\nI don't even like boxing and I still bought that game because the graphics were pretty revolutionary at the time.\n\n[removed]\n\nChampion and round 3 were the best\n\nRound 3 hands down. They over simplified the analog punch controls and countering in 4 and champ, just didn't feel right\n\nMy friend had round 3 and we played a lot. The only thing was he always insisted on being Ali, whose haymaker was bullshit because it was stupid fast, while every other boxer telegraphed their haymakers like a motherfucker.\n\nMy buddy as Joe Frazier used to knock me the fuck out as Ali lol\n\nI only played round 3 at a buddies house and thought the punching style was so fun. Can't believe no other game has continued it.\n\nMan I was so fucking bad at that game. I loved it though.\n\nBut only if you zoom in on the character's model. Which isn't a feature available in the game unlees you buy the autonomous ultra instinct version package.\n\nYou can? It looks like The Sims!\n\nJust a joke about how every sports game is the same except for a minor graphical improvement.\n\nE. A. SPORTS, ITS THE SAME GAME!\n\nEA sports is the iphone of gaming industry\n\nHey, you can’t expect grappling along the fence in a UFC game.\n\nEasy to see how this minor big would be overlooked \n\nVIRTUALLY IDENTICAL (my fellow MMA fans will get this one)\n\n“Ahh the champion!” Love and hate Goldy\n\nHis precision was very precise.\n\nThere’s a YouTube compilation of his fails that I watch a few times a year if I need a good laugh cry. Never fails to make me lose it.\n\nNo joke, and it's a 10-year-old video too.\n\nKick was returned by graphics really have started the plateau in the past 10 years or so. \n\nYou can't get any more realistic than photo-realistic.\n\nThere's a section of my brain that is permanently occupied by\n\n**\"YVES LAVIGNE WITH THE PSYCHIC KNOCKOUT!\"**\n\nMine is \"he's showing incredible flexibility in his bones, Joe.\"\n\nMan I've seen this video so many times these years I hear all these quotes perfectly in my mind.\n\nBecause some things on the internet are perfect.\n\nWELL JOE IT LOOKS LIKE HE'S USING SORCERY...!\n\nThat video never fails to get me absolutely wrecked\n\nOne of my profs showed it to me and now its on my rotation of videos to show other people\n\nMike there's a bigfoot!\n\nhe truly is the Michael Jordan of magic\n\n10 years later and that ghost is still haunting the arena I see.\n\nYears ago I was in a really dark place, and that series of goofball videos laughed me out of some really stupid decisions. I still crack up every time I think of them\n\nIt's always stuck with me too. Happy to bring back some good memories by linking it here again.\n\nThis is fantastic. lmao\n\nLmao the 40 second mark. \"Ref, the guy has clearly got brain damage, call off the fight!! Look at that fencing response! \"\n\nVery few things make me tear up from laughter like these videos.\n\nI was going to post this but you beat me to it. I miss Tommy Toe Hold. I know he does MMA On Point videos but it's not nearly the same as his old content.\n\n\"He's showing incredible flexibility in his bones, Joe!\" lmao\n\nWhat kind of fighting style is that?  Ketamine Master?\n\nIt actually looks a bit like drunken boxing lol.\n\nMysteries of Ket Boxing.\n\nWell it isnt a mystery that these are the type of fist you throw when you are violently crying.\n\nTrained by the best of the mantis people.\n\nScarecrow style.\n\nAnd people (like OP) are gonna keep buying them year after year anyway…\n\nCan’t wait for the new FIFA \n\n👁️👄👁️\n\nHey, it’s ‘EA FC’ now, because two wholesome organisations like FIFA and EA couldn’t get along anymore…\n\nFifa wanted 1b for the name. i checked that and thats 3 fifa games worth of income.\n\nWhat the fucking shit😭\n\nFifa is and always has been corrupt and evil\n\nImagine being greedier than EA\n\nThere’s always a greedier fish\n\nGobble Gobble 😋\n\nThey out-greed-ed EA. Society is well and truly fucked, isn't it?\n\nIt’s not society, it’s a few thousand egotistical megalomaniacs with god complexes who have the part of their brain that recognizes what is “enough” switched off. They think differently than normal people; everything is through the lens of “how do I get more?” Unfortunately that group has all the power in our society because they have (almost) literally all of the money. Don’t let evil groups of people convince you that humanity itself is all like that.\n\nIt's also a whole host of politicians who allow for shit like this to happen (mostly because of regulatory capture and the like), not to mention thousands of henchmen and useful idiots that go along with the nearly unprecedented greed.\n\nGo out and vote folks - it really does matter.\n\nJust the name! There's nothing that come with it either, just the brand.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nLike Apple charging Google 39b just to slap an Apple on Pixels.\n\nThey also really strict how the game is implemented/created, like for instance there couldn't be like an \"arcade\" mode or whatever (not saying EA would do that, but EA didn't have full creative control over the games at all)\n\nWhat creative control do they need? They just change the textures, make the controlls a little bit worse and slap a new title on it.\n\nbro... what?\n\nHopefully the game will get less popular and all that people will start making actual new games. ( it's ea who am I kidding )\n\nBring back Pro Evo, Sensible Soccer and Red Card Football \n\nWe need Sensi back.\n\nWe need Emlyn Hughes's international soccer back\n\n[deleted]\n\nFortunately I've never been a fan of sports games so I'm all set to play\n\nMan, seeing this crap and going back to my retro collection I really REALLY miss Sega Sports.\n\nI did wonder what the fuck EAFC was when i saw some clips of it.. thought it was a cheap knockoff..\n\nturns out i was right, in a way\n\nAlready released, already broken, people in that sub unanimously say: this is the worst version yet lol\n\nPeople say that every year rofl\n\nAnd then buy next year's release.\n\nCause it can only get better right. Statistics say if this is the worst one so far it's likely going to go back up toward the average..... right?\n\nAnd yet it still doesn't. It's like EA is competing with itself to see just who can produce the worst flaming pile of garbage that sells and manages to 1 up itself every year.\n\nI stopped buying Fifa about 5 or 6 years ago. Nothing really improves from one year to another. I just wait for the new FIFA to be on gamepass.\n\nI think I stopped after 2003 lol\n\nI bought it on the steam sale for around five bucks. It's alright for that price.\n\nSame as the madden dudes. It blows my mind\n\nWhat's funny is I felt this way about Madden in 2004...\n\nI remember being like are they really going to just release a full game every year? \n\n20 years later they're still laughing at how stupid and easily conned the average gamer is.\n\nIIRC Madden got better every year until about 2007 or 2008, then it slowly degraded.  Then they started removing features, waiting a couple years, and bringing them back as microtransactions.\n\nWe had good football games from 99-2005. Then EA shut down the NFL 2K series. Fuck them and their garbage games.\n\nNFL 2k5 is still among the best, if not the best, football game ever released.\n\nI bought an OG Xbox over the summer and have played more NFL 2K5 in the past two months than I have played of any football game in the past 15 years.\n\nWhich is crazy almost 20 years later. \n\nThere are adults younger than that game. Soon they’ll be able to drink in the US.\n\nMadden 2008 was god tier. With all the advances in technology there is less shit than ever to do in the modern Madden games. It's a joke.\n\nPlayed Madden 07 and 10. Finally bought another in like 2020 and couldn't believe how bad it was. I refunded it after like 3 hours and hopped back on my PS2 to play Madden 10.\n\nWhy would they do anything different? If you want an NFL game it’s gotta be EA produced shit. If they had even an ounce of competition they’d be SOL\n\nWould they have competition though? Pretty sure there isn't exclusivity regarding licensing for soccer or baseball and FIFA/EA FC and MLB the show is the same shit every year and they don't have any real competition.\n\nme and bro talk about madden 08 till this day. its crazy that you cant design playbooks anymore, crazy regression.\n\nAnd NHL dudes\n\nMutant League Football&gt;Madden\n\n\"Buys an incomplete game\"\n\"Complains he bought an incomplete game\"\n\nBuys the game again in 365 days\n\n[deleted]\n\nWhen someone online calls him an idiot, he replies with \"durnt tell me how to spdnd my money\"\n\n12 years later, this video is still relevant: https://youtu.be/e-LE0ycgkBQ\n\nI've said it once, and I'll keep saying it. \n\nIt would take a literal genie wish to get enough gamers to coordinate an unyielding protest of simply not buying game, after game, to get the message across: \"Enough, stop putting out bullshit. Stop with crunch culture. Take your time, make a quality product and don't water it down with shit like micro-transactions.\"  \n\nOne of two things would happen: \n\n1) Message received. We will do better from now on, we know better than to take advantage of you. \n\n2) (More likely) many large studios shut down due to near 0 sales as they produce more shit and don't listen. This results in gaming forever changed negatively as \"no one wants to buy games anymore.\"\n\nDoesn't 2 just open the door for indies to become the new big guys? Capitalism runs on growth and the blood of the innocent, and little guys becoming big guys does fulfill the growth part of that formula.\n\nMaybe?  It's more likely to scare investors off and result in a significant drop in the overall market for a long time.  So little guys probably would take a long time to become big guys, but they theoretically could if they had slow natural growth over time.  \n\nThings might just get consolidated into the big guys who survive.\n\nTo be fair, this is even worse than fifa - the game in the video in UFC 5 which was released 3 years after UFC 4.\n\nUFC games don't get an annual release.\n\nAnd OP is going to buy that exact same game for next year\n\nBut If you say don't pre order and stuff like that, they say \"who are you to tell me what to do\" and proceed to buy anyway\n\nThis is not a yearly franchise tbf\n\nEveryone wonders why \"pre-orders\" are still a thing....\n\nAbsolutely no one wonders that.\n\nI get why the companies want you to do spend the money now, I don't get why gamers preorder. Not like with downloads there will be a supply crunch.\n\nDon't you want this fancy gold colored hat?\n\nSorry but you earned it if you're still buying mainstream sports games\n\nYup, I've bought like 3-4 games on my Steamdeck that cost less in total than this game and I've been playing them non-stop for over a year.\n\nSports games are such a laughable scam these days and honestly not even that enjoyable.\n\nThe problem is the licensing. Most people don’t just want to play the sport, they want to play as the current athletes. So as long as EA and the like have a stranglehold on those rights, it’s never gonna change and it won’t matter how good other sports games are.\n\nMan imagine if Nintendo characters aged and people had to buy Mario Kart 2027 to replace Mario Kart 2026 because he now has a beard and belongs to the Mushroom Pistons instead of the Mario Brothers Teams and his old kart had Goombear Tires so it's just shameful to play.\n\nInstead they just re-release the same game as on WiiU, then the same game with an expansion, and a mobile phone game. \n\nMario Kart 8 is 10 years old.\n\nI'm gonna go out on a limb and say that entirely new race tracks in a gimmicky go-kart racer have more value than adding stubble to a few characters in an otherwise identical game.\n\nYes but it’s also time for a new Mario Kart with a fully new track list. Mario Kart is one of my favorite games of all time and I would like a new game. \n \nI will say though that not releasing a new game is a far better business practice than releasing “new games” constantly with hardly anything changed and nothing fixed from old versions.\n\nI like the picture you are painting, it highlights the silliness of the entire situation and is pretty spot on. However, one thing to keep in mind is that fighting games tend to have a higher turnover of characters, that is there's going to be new characters coming in and old ones leaving, making it a bit different than simply aging up the existing characters or changing their team affiliations.\n\n*That being said*, there is no (valid) reason why an entirely \"new\" game has to be released, when those characters can simply be part of an optional DLC, a new patch, or a season pass or something. I am in no way trying to defend these shitty practices of re-releasing the same game (with the same bugs) over and over again. There might have been a reason for it 20 years ago when games were still complete products contained wholly on the physical disc itself, but in the current landscape of mandatory day 1 patches, downloads, and digital deliveries there's absolutely no justification for it.\n\nRelease the \"definitive\" fighting game, service it with DLC or add-on content throughout the seasons, make lots of money, and release a new game every 5 - 7 years when the technological advances justify re-releasing the base game. That would be alright, but those companies just love their money too much in order to do right by the players.\n\nAnother thing with fighting games, outside of the pro-wrestling sphere of sports fighters, is that they used to rely substantially on the strength of their characterization and the scenario / campaigns, and not just the competition or mechanics or rerelease. Even simple arcade fighters like Street Fighter II spiced things up by adding weird characters like Blanka who were visually different and interesting. Games that are all multiplayer all the time, and especially based on real people who are extremely limited in design variety by virtue of the fact, can't lean on that stuff.\n\nThere was a point where (particularly Namco fighters) people got SoulCalibur III or Tekken 5/6 because they kind of wanted to see what their favorite characters scenarios were going to be, even if it was something stupid and silly like Kuma running a global corporation and getting dropped down a shaft. Those little cinematics did a lot to endear people to the franchises.\n\nJock larping\n\nCould you name the games?\n\nA scam for sure, but as a fan of sports it makes sports more enjoyable for me.\n\nThere's no non-mainstream sports games, they can't get the licensing. There's no alternative to UFC. If you want a good game based on MMA you won't be able to find it either. Even the boxing games are shit, tried Undisputed and the selection is shit and it's buggy and slow.\n\nWho´s needs licensing? Just make a Tekken game and dial up the Realism with mma rules.\n\nYou're still ignoring the aspect that is \"I want to play as my favorite team or fight with my favorite fighter.\"\n\nI don't love Madden (I don't think it's as bad as people say) but I don't want to play as the Detroit Thundercats and win \"the big game\". I wanna be the Lions and win a super bowl.\n\nBut then they'd have to spend money actually making a game instead of licensing (which for the most part is the reason why people buy games like this)\n\nI still play PES 2013 and never looking other game except PES 2021 that when Konami actually try something\n\nYou think people are buying sports games every year because they are amazing games and not just because they are fans of the sport the game covers?\n\nThe crazy thing is you can be just as much of a fan of those sports without playing a shitty game.\n\nYes, but the reason people buy UFC/NHL/NFL etc. is largely due to the roster changes and new names/player statistics. In a perfect world, they just change stats in updates occasionally, but it's not a perfect world. In order to play the new guys or see meaningful stat changes, you NEED the newest ones. It's annoyingly smart on EA's part to milk the sports fans every year. If people can afford it I see no reason to shame them.\n\nIt’s not about making me more of a fan. \n\nIt’s how I find it fun to learn about the players and staff that make up each team and learn relevant stats. Also, helps me better understand the rules of the game in an immersive way! \n\nCheers!\n\n&gt; Also, helps me better understand the rules of the game in an immersive way!\n\nYeah, honestly playing Madden 2000 back in the day taught me *way* more about the sport than watching it on TV or from the stands.  And I'd imagine that is the case for newcomers to most sports to this day.\n\nCFB 2025 was/is pretty sweet\n\nI play a lot of different type of games, but unironically one of the games I have enjoyed most was UFC 2. I put about 1000 hours into that game and loved every second. There is nothing wrong with sports games if you like them.\n\nA full price game being bad is a tale as old as time.  Well at least as old as video games\n\nAdjusted for inflation, if you bought ET on Atari in 1982, you spent about $77.\n\nI played that absolutely amazing game in a video game museum in Rome, was certainly one of the greatest experiences of my life... easily worth a good $77 ;)\n\nfound the dimensional traveller\n\nYou should have seen the state chess came in when it was first invented. The queen couldn't move more than one square diagonally. Literally unplayable.\n\nspeaking of chess, there was an absolutely amazing chess game I played the shit out of on my PC in the early 90's.  Battle Chess, I think it was called.\n\nAnimated chess pieces ripping each other apart? Loved that one, too!\n\nbattle vs chess and its peak\n\nBattle Chess is a classic. LOVED that game. It had an NES port too.\n\nHe's lockin' but he ain't poppin' right...\n\nI would poop a little if my opponent did that after touch..\n\nIt's your own fault for buying the known slop games\n\nFr, I haven’t bought an EA sports title since ps2 era. Pure slop.\n\nNot sure how you play at 5 fps\n\nSomebody's obviously lagging out.  Why the other guy's suddenly doing his best Junji Ito monster impersonation is beyond me.\n\nI mean his name is GamROT. That's clearly his regular fighting style\n\nRealistic, that's exactly how Gamrot fights\n\nAh yes,definitely worth 70$\n\nIf people buy shit for $70 why not keep selling it?\n\nPoor LordHunter, forced to fight a legit Wendigo\n\nfrom a dev perspective, grappling human models is just about the most difficult thing to achieve in a smooth manner, especially in online play.\n\nSo that's why all the NSFW games suck...\n\nI get it. On one hand, its probably really difficult to program UFC fighting and bugs will always be a thing. But, on the other hand, don't sell games you can't program, especially for $70.\n\nIdk about you but I don’t expect *no* bugs in a game. Any game. It’s more about the plurality of bugs. If this is every 100 fights I’d honestly not mind too much even if it was never fixed. If I can’t get through 15 minutes without something fucking up, then yeah I’d agree. To my understanding this is the former though, it’s a solid game with the occasional bug\n\nI think part of it is people have lost their tolerance/appreciation for jank. If Skyrim or halo 2 came out today yall would tear it to shreds\n\nYOu can have the best QA dept in the world, and come nowhere CLOSE to the hammering a game gets with week in the wild .\n\nPeople love going on and on about how 'it wasn't always like this!' and how old games used to ship complete without bugs. I'm like, I don't know what planet you grew up on; I know as much as I do about computers BECAUSE of all the bugs and problems old games had. I remember spending weeks as a child with no internet trying to get shareware games running.\n\n100% agree, this type of shit is nothing new.\n\nTHANK YOU! Games always had bugs and glicthes and shit. People talk so much about a past that never existed.\n\nSoul Calibur 3 on PS2 had a bug that wiped your whole memory card. Happened to me at the time but I didn't know that it was the culprit until years later. (it was one of my most played games)\n\nCase in point - speed running. A huge portion of that hobby relies on exploiting glitches and bugs. The infamous Mario Stairs always flashes in my mind \n\nYup. Just look at BG3, amazing game, won all the awards it could, but speed runners go through it in 20 min using a bunch of weird ass bugs.\n\nBeen playing Fallout 4 lately, love it too but that's an old AAA game now and you randomly die walking too close to a car.\n\nGames always had bugs, as long as they're not in your face all the time you just smirk when they happen and keep going.\n\npeople don't realize how lucky we are now that games can be patched or \"fixed\" constantly. games used to ship unplayable or unbeatable in some cases and the variety of features locked to certain pc parts made it difficult to even know if you could run or play the game, now we have the internet and a mostly homogenized pc ecosystem that can accommodate all the various configurations.\n\n&gt;People playing online with the router in a basement behind 4 layers of brick with half a bar of connectivity dropping every other packet:\n\n\nThis is the developer's fault!\n\nDrunken master style?\n\nThis is a 70 cent gif.\n\nIt's a classic Mummy Guard Joe.\n\n*teleports behind you with wacky waving inflatable arm flailing tube man arms*\n\n\"Nothing personnell, kid.\"\n\nidk, i personally *love* this shit. its hilarious.\n\n I love it too, but I wouldn't pay more than 10 bucks for it since I'm sure it would get old pretty quick.\n\nI’ve played this game A LOT and never had anything close to this happen.\n\nLocal multiplayer + stand&amp;bang is awesome.\n\nThat's actually how Gamrot fights..\n\nThis is a feature, Yall forgot about drunken fist.\n\nLike a $40 in 2004 , or a $23 game on 1984. \n\n\nWe keep paying less and less for these games, why do they keep getting worse and worse?\n\nAre you tired of EA's questionable business practices? Do you feel like their games are overpriced or poorly built? Then maybe it's time to take your wallet elsewhere!\n\nAAA quality.\n\n[deleted]\n\nlol.. maybe it's a new fighting style..\n\nLooks like Dalsim is a playable character\n\nThe Drunken Master style 🔥\n\nE. E. E. EEEE.\n\nNaw bro has that Luffy fighting style\n\nMeanwhile though you got space marine 2 and sparking zero that are coming out putting these other devs to shame\n\nI see you got that Dhalsim DLC. Only needs a Yoga fire move\n\nI would pay $70 for a game that regularly did this\n\nI'm like the Mayor of Gravity Falls watching this\n\nGeeet 'im!\n\nI played this game in the 90s, it's called Pit Fighter.\n\nDrunken Master style!\n\n“These fuckers keep fucking me.” “Here’s my money.” Ad nauseum\n\nAnd you’ll still buy the new same game next year.\n\nStop complaining on Reddit and complaining with your wallet.\n\nThe answer is to pirate everything EA or Ubisoft makes. Give your money to indie devs instead\n\nAre you playing online? This looks more like a internet issue to me\n\nEAGames is fucking horrible. FIFA is unplayable as well.\n\n[deleted]\n\nCool, now get casual fans who actually by these sports games to stop and ill give it a shit. you certainly didnt help\n\nI think EA has moved from the “phoning it home” phase, and into the *”Fuck you, buy it.”* phase\n\nyou still bought it"

But a \"corrected\" version of it so my monitor is not 50% a bloodied knife.\n\ndid this with rdr2. bought it and they wanted a rockstar account and 30 weirdly complex captchas that reset if you failed a single one to log in, and once i was done i couldnt play it on my offline steam deck. refunded and pirated it and i only had to launch a single .exe to get it to work anytime/anywhere i wanted. its insane how paying gets you a worse experience\n\nThis is something the music industry figured out a while ago. It's a customer service problem.\n\nWhen it was easier to illegally download music than to get it legally people pirated it. Once they made music as easy to access legally as illegally most people stopped pirating it.\n\neh, it wasnt just the access, it was also not charging $20 for 10 songs.  Flat fees for streaming everything from one source is what made it worth paying.\n\nOf course then there are those among us that still listen to the same 10 songs and pay for it month after month.\n\nHey shut up. Some of us have at least 20 songs that we listen to on repeat.\n\nBut now it's even easier to pirate than ever before which is funny. You can torrent high quality rips easier than you could download a low quality mp3 back in the day which had a 80% chance of being a different song or just moans.\n\nYes but even easier than pirating is downloading Spotify and having nearly any song ever at your fingertips instantly.\n\n*I did not have sexual relations with that woman*\n\nIf buying it isn't ownership, then torrenting it isn't stealing.\n\nSame, couldn't even launch and tried to refund it, but steam fucking refused the refund. Naturally I harbor even more hate for rockstar, steam and modern game industry over that whole thing now.\n\nDidn't even bother pirating the game after that. Just said fuck you and fuck off to rdr.\n\nAnd don't forget how Ubisoft literally stole The Crew from everyone's libraries.\n\nWhich is why https://www.stopkillinggames.com got started and now Ubisoft are being investigated by multiple governments.\n\nIf you want to stop Ubishaft from stealing your games, go sign the petition\n\nPersonally don’t think you missed much. I couldn’t even get through the first mission with how boring it was. Call me a.d.d. but I need some action right off the bat - save the slow evolution for after I’m already hooked.\n\nI once tried to play The Division 2 offline because I didn't care about the intrusive online content, but the game essentially says, 'Hey, you can’t play unless you prove you own this game by being online on our platform.' Imagine buying a game just for its single-player mode and not being able to play it simply because you can’t connect to the internet. This is a shitty trend that's been going on for major video game corporations.\n\n&gt;  its insane how paying gets you a worse experience\n\nI just had Louis Rossman flashbacks!\n\nIt's been a while since I've watched his videos, but the most recent one I saw (last year) was about Netflix not providing full HD on computer streaming, because they sell the data gathered from TV apps.  So it was time to cancel the subscription and take to the high seas.\n\nAlso, buy \"corporate\" or \"business\" model TVs, because they won't default to tracking data.\n\nA game about pirates requires you to become one yourself.\n\nWait it works better? Holy shit screw my legal copy, I already bought the game so I deserve to have it work!\n\nYes lol the same is true for watch dogs 2\n\n*Silently points to \"God of War Ragnarok\", which runs on 2Gb VRAM when pirated, but demanded 6Gb with legal copy (at the beginning).*\n\nJeesus\n\nI mean, if you already own it you aren't \"pirating\" it. You're just \"downloading a backup copy.\"\n\nJust like Gaben said, \"piracy is a service issue\". Ever since hearing this I no longer feel bad pirating anything when it's reasonable.\n\nHe's not wrong, if a game is on stream I'll buy it. If it's not, sailing I go. Whenever Epics launcher catches up, or any of the other junk, maybe I'll use them.\n\n&gt;  if a game is on stream I'll buy it\n\nI'm generally the same, but if anything has some secondary authentication launcher attached to it back to the refund bin it goes. I havent felt an overwhelming need to pirate anything in ages though, there's just so much good content out there that I have plenty to do.\n\nI refunded Doom Eternal, I have yet to pick up Anno 1800, and ubisoft in general has been banned from my library since 2011. It would be neat to have played those games but I'm not dealing with some shitty second launcher setup just so a company can collect data and try to divert me to their shop environment.\n\nAre you telling me they are actually promoting piracy with their DRM/online service bullshit? who'da thunk it!?\n\nThis reminds me of when Borderlands 3 for PC launched a Virtual Machine with a keylogger as part of its DRM. It literally made a computer within your computer to monitor you. And they fucked it up because the keylogger would get stuck, think “that ain’t right” and shut you down.\n\nSomeone should be in jail for that and I’m not even kidding. People have gone to jail for much much less when it comes to computer systems and unauthorized access.\n\nWell you see in chapter 3,562 of the EULA it clearly states that Ubisoft owns your entire PC if you installed this piece of software. \n\n*EULA can only be viewed by downloading and running the game and by downloading and running the game you agree to the EULA*\n\nEdit: /s because this apparently isn’t clear enough\n\nYou kid, but I was reading about a case brought against Hyundai recently where the courts decided that because the guy clicked \"accept\" on the EULA 8 years ago, and the EULA said he would agree to never take them to court, that he wasn't allowed to.\n\neula was probably 80 pages too, no one reads that bs\n\nThis was Disney's argument when a woman died from an allergic reaction to an undisclosed allergen on their property.\n\nShe had Disney+, and when she created the account, she \"agreed to arbitration and waived right to suit.\"  Disney almost-successfully argued that dying on their parks was covered by the Disney+ agreement.\n\n&gt;Disney almost-successfully argued that dying on their parks was covered by the Disney+ agreement.\n\nIt was their argument in some pre-trial motion, but when the Internet heard about it, Disney backed down so quickly I could swear I heard a sonic boom. No judge ever ruled on the theory.\n\nthat case was so sad, too. they made sure to tell the staff multiple times about her allergies and they were ignored.\n\nI’m sorry THEY DID WHAT?!?! AND FOR WHY?!?\n\nReminds me of the time [Sony included a rootkit on their music CDs.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_BMG_copy_protection_rootkit_scandal)\n\nNot only did it monitor your activity and report it back to Sony, it also could be used by other bad actors to piggyback their own malware under the shroud of the original rootkit.  When they were called out on it they released software to remove it that actually just hid it better and added more of their own malware while also giving them a chance to tie your tracked behavior to the email address you had to give them to get the \"uninstaller.\"\n\nheads should've rolled when this happened\n\nI use Ubisoft so rarely because their launcher is so ass that I forget what account I own their games on and lose access... I have several Far Cry and Division games I can't get to cause I don't know what account they're on to ask their support for help lol\n\nI know it's probably a \"me\" problem but my password vault manages to track everything else and no other launcher is so obnoxious that I avoid it to the extent I have that problem, only Ubisoft\n\nNothing good comes from shitty extra launchers. Its an L even for companies like Firaxis and Larian to have that shit. If you sell your game via Steam, launch directly from Steam.\n\nJfc I was about to write the exact same comment; have been shitting on UbiShit ever since, never buying anything of theirs ever again\n\nThe only Ubisoft game I've been tempted by in the last 15 years is _Far Cry Primal._  And what has held me back?  Yes: Uplay.  And particularly the fact that even though the game has achievements like any game since the early 2000s, Ubisoft seems to have decided that flipping a switch to enable those for Steam was too much work for the (checks) $30 they're still charging for this 2016 game that's basically just a reskin of _Far Cry 4._\n\nCompanies like Ubisoft and EA don't need your money, let alone deserve it. Coincidentally, bypassing their bullshit is also the highest quality of life feature that could be added.\n\nHappened to me but for Far Cry 2.  Uplay refused to launch the game.\n\nThat also happened to me for a smaller scale puzzle game called From Dust that was just impossible to work properly, with both Uplay being a pain and the game itself breaking, I got a cracked version that worked flawlessly\n\nEven the Ubisoft launcher can't believe you'd want to own a Ubisoft game\n\n\"Someone paid money for this? That can't be right\"\n\nI read that in Dunkey’s voice\n\n[removed]\n\n#WARNING \n \nsp@m account above.  \n9 year old account that has been dormant for 9 years before making successive comments and rep0sts.  \nMany such accounts are everywhere on reddit. Not a unique case. They use AI to form replies.  \nElections are coming up so you can imagine who will be buying these accounts \n \nreport &gt; sp@m\n\nI read everything to do with games in Dunkey's voice.\n\nI read everything in Dunkey's voice. I'm Dunkzophrenic\n\noobeesoft\n\nI think i got division 2 on sale awhile back in xbox for like $3 or something\n\nNice try Ubisoft guerilla marketer \\\\s\n\n\"How am I supposed to scam you by giving you money?\"\n\nAt least when you don't pay money for it, the authentication is guaranteed as that's the whole point.\n\nDude just last night just tried to reinstall Far Cry 3 and the fuckin launcher crashed on me like 4 times, then I got into the game and played for like 15 minutes before the shit crashed again.  I know it ain't my computer because I played through this shit on a potato back in like 2010 or whenever it came out so idk man.  Fuckin lame...\n\n[deleted]\n\n\"Piracy is almost always a service problem and not a pricing problem\"\n\nGabe Newell, Co founder and President of Valve Software\n\nSteam and Netflix both stopped me pirating stuff.\n\nThough now I've started torrenting tv shows and movies again because there are too many streaming services and I have zero interest in subbing to all of them. If they want my money they can bring their shows back to Netflix. Otherwise I'm just downloading their stuff again.\n\niTunes, Spotify, Steam, Netflix: \n\nIt’s been repeatedly shown that convenience is something people desire. \n\nThe digital music landscape in the 2000s meant that online piracy of songs was alive and well, but they were a hassle to find the song you wanted, convert it to an MP3 file, download it and then move it to your player. \n\nApple streamlined the entire process, especially for the layman, and even combined hardware and software into one easy package. \n\nMajority of people are willing to pay a convenience fee if it does eliminate all steps between you and the product to one button. \n\nThis stops working if each person involved in the product starts throwing up their own special steps and re-complicates the process.\n\nalso everything has a price, the moment that convenience fee becomes 20+ dollars (or wtv each individual is willing to spend) for ONE service everyone will probably pirate the other services... I pay for Spotify, because most of the music I listen to is there, I'm sure as hell not paying any individual streaming services, because at their prices they're not only competing with themselves, but with Spotify...\n\nif their streaming prices were 5$ id consider still paying for Netflix, just for convenience.\n\n\nbut nah, expensive and split into multiple services just killed streaming for me\n\nThat would be due to \"[Enshittification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification)\"\n\nI have stopped pirating games for about 10 years now, since I got my paycheck. They don't cost much and having access to them at any time on any machine in the latest updated patch in 4-5 clicks is a convenience I cannot live without now.\n\nNetflix stop being good when the other companies started setting up their own shit.\n\nT Balkanization of streaming services. Combined with the deterioration of the \"Smart TV\" UI and the proliferation of inescapable ads it's a great way to drive people back to cable TV which is realtime with no buffering or lag.\n\n&gt; drive people back to cable TV which is realtime with no buffering or lag.\n\nor you know... to pirating which is what I've done, I pirated before because cable sucked , I stopped pirating with netflix, and now streaming is as bad as cable, I'm not going back to cable lol I'm just pirating again\n\nTeenage pirate me would be so jealous of my jellyfin server.\n\nsee also the return of downloading as streaming services both fragment and get more expensive\n\nStill sucks that they've gotten their roots into the older generations though and can pull the BS like charging for sharing with your family and such. They'll see all of this as normal as it's like what Cable TV was like.\n\nMeanwhile every single young person I know now owns zero or *maybe one* streaming subscription and pirates everything else.\n\nYup. Offer a good product that is consumer focused and people will pay more often than not.\n\nALL HAIL GABEN!\n\nPirated games are heavily compressed and optional languages and other bloat crap are taken out.\n\nAnd no drm like Denuvo which is a known to cause performance issues with games.\n\nDownload size is smaller cuz the pirates often give you the option to remove all the bullshit voice dubs from other languages that take up tons of space\n\nPirated versions often take out a load of languages (and if you need them can download a different one that has them in), I wonder if that's why it was smaller.  \n\nFor games with pre-rendered cut-scenes they can be compressed more or removed.  \n\nAny of these though, it would probably tell you wherever you sourced it from if that was the case.\n\n\nIt is indeed more likely that the original copy has a whole load of unused content in it, which would mean whoever packaged the pirated version did a better job of release than Ubisoft...\n\n[removed]\n\nHonestly anything that uses any other launcher or drm than steam, I just grab a pirated copy for the steam deck.\n\nThis is why I haven’t bought Prince of Persia yet. I have issues launching Splinter Cell Blacklist sometimes.\n\nPrince of Persia has been in my cart on at least 3 occasions. I've got about as much confidence in an Ubisoft purchase as an NFT. At least the NFT is secure unless *I* do something irresponsible.\n\nFWIW I just started playing through Prince of Persia last night and it's a great metroidvania style game. You probably already knew that from the reviews, but I'm still pleasantly surprised, given that it's an Ubisoft title.\n\n“You need to get used to not owning your games” Ubisoft said this\n\nThey're dogshit but they're also right in that regard. We haven't owned our games for a while now and it doesn't seem like the trend is moving back to discs and actual ownership. Fingers crossed the EU drags the industry kicking and screaming into us owning digital games and the accounts for these services and being able to resell them or pass them on to our kids. Imo game licenses should be tradable on steam like items are for one\n\nYou realize it's the same with Steam right?\n\nTbf the original Division wasn't too bad a game\n\nThe second one was really solid too.\n\nThe Division in general would make a great spy/action series, if ubi gave a single fak about the franchise :'(\n\nI still have no idea what its about.\n\nits about people shooting eachother, right?\n\nThat's what it looks like if you don't go read some of the  documents/audio you find, or if you play the main  missions in random order (no idea why they allow you to get even more confused playing the \"story\" like that). Sad, really, because they have some really interesting characters like Keener, or the woman protagonist in the books... Lots of lore that most player will never have the chance to know about.\n\nI mean either you havent played it, so that makes sense you have no idea what it's about. Or you have played it and you skipped every cutscene and or turned the sound down so low you didn't hear all of the quest chatter.\n\nLet’s start an alternative company called I-be-hard\n\nIt can either be a sex toy company, a men’s sexual health company, or a kids toy company that has durable toys for kids that are indestructible.\n\nWhy would you want to cater to indestructible kids? Surely they're too dangerous to be coddled, right?\n\nNo, it makes sense. If you're indestructible then you'd probably be careless. Walking into fire, jumping out of buildings, etc. Makes sense you'd need very durable toys (and clothes!).\n\nGetting Jack-Jack flashbacks\n\nFromSoft already makes those xD\n\nThey'd have a funny inverse name too.\n\nYou can publish my friend's game idea, Pokewoman\n\nI don't think the opposite of \"-mon\" is \"woman\". Unless you're in the caribbean. It might be the opposite there\n\nYes\n\nWith blackjack and hookers?\n\nHoly crap that took me a while\n\n*I-am-hard\n\n“Hmm I see you paid for the game, and the game is in your catalogue and played it for 4 hours, hmmm still not sure if if your allowed ownership,  and to add to that, we don’t give a shit”   \n- Ubisoft probably\n\nImagine them letting us think we have ownership of the game.\n\n\"This product\" is the perfect wording for that. You'd think it's the game, but it's just the license to play it... for now.\n\n[removed]\n\n[removed]\n\nThe best answer. Vote with your wallet.\n\nSounds like they didn't provide some features that you paid for. Maybe when AC:S comes out, it'll be time for them to provide some features you didn't pay for 😉\n\n&gt; I hope my resolve holds when AC Shadows is released.\n\nThis statement means it won't. And that is why companies will never need to change. You literally got screwed by a company: They defrauded you. And you're like \"well, hopefully I'll still be mad about being defrauded later...\".\n\nThe Ghost Of Yotei announcement has made me rethink my excitement about AC Shadows\n\nYour first mistake was to think Ubisoft gives a shit about its customers.\n\nUbisoft and Customer Care are like water and oil\n\nNot a truer word. The Crew 2 was going dirt cheap on Xbox, I got it. Game crashed after the main menu. Contacted Ubisoft online, took nearly 2 whole weeks for them to respond and say they aren’t really sure what the issue is and asked for my Ubisoft account username to pass to their techies. I ended up managing to fix it myself by disconnecting my PlayStation and Amazon accounts from Ubisoft connect.\n\nI agree on everything besides Custom Support. Most companies outsource their support, so people on the other side often have no clue what you are talking about.\n\nIm not saying its not Ubi's fault, Im saying that most supports that are extremely often outsourced are GARBAGE of an experience. Id say its easier to actually rememeber the good ones, because there are so little of them.\n\nI would say more like water and cats. We are the water, they need us to survive, still will run away from us.\n\nTook me like 2 months just to get my phone number linked to my account (had to go through customer service/2fa issues)\n\nThe customer support number now just connects to a chat bot that has been instructed to insult you and your family until you hang up.\n\nYou might [be onto something](https://i.imgur.com/fmqk47a.png).\n\nOr its hired developers or IP's they have bought.\n\nThe way they have abused the wonderful Heroes of Might and Magic franchise, which originally was created by and developed by New World Computing for four games, really rubs me the wrong way. \n\nFor the first game in the series made by outsourced devs, they actually brought in a capable team called Nival, which made a very good entry in the series, even though it lacked the outstanding art direction and elegance of the older games. But Ubisoft forced a number of bad ideas on the developer through the process. \n\nThe next two games HoMM6 and HoMM7, was disasters, and the developers of those games were screwed over by Ubisoft as much as the customers were. HoMM7 never was finished and became a bug-ridden mess. Now they have found another team to make another entry, in what once was one of the best strategy series around.\n\nHonestly valve should disallow any kind of secondary launchers for games purchased on steam. The ubisoft launcher needs to die asap\n\nNever purchased anything outside steam/GOG. Then a game I couldn't get on steam had me buy it on Epic. Which made me download both Epic and Ubisoft launchers.And required me to log in on both almost everytime I restarted my PC. \n\nNeedless to say that game has now been refunded and all their junkware has been deleted. Ridiculous.\n\nI know you've since refunded but I bought Immortals: Fenyx Rising through Epic (Christmas coupon offer), which in turn made me get Ubisoft Connect, but once it was redeemed with Ubisoft I no longer required Epic at all. It just added it to my library with Ubi.\n\nSidetrack but I love Immortals: Fenyx Rising. Pity not enough people bought it and now the sequel is cancelled\n\nThe nice thing on Epic with these kinds of games is that the game is activated on both launchers. So, you'll have the game on both Epic Launcher and Ubisoft Connect and you can install it directly from Ubisoft Connect and launch it from there.\n\nOn Steam is not like this.\n\nYeah, it's weird needing another launcher. Like I get needing a platform account (specifically for games with cross-platform progress like Destiny 2 or Diablo 4), but that should be handled in-game, not through another launcher.\n\nValve doesn't care. They just want as many possible games to run through steam. Irrespective of additional launchers. If Valve tried to impose, other companies would just de-list from Valve\n\nthe valve store page warns you if there's a secondary launcher. I just ignore all games if there's a secondary launcher requirement\n\nand yet they would return, you see even playstation now selling on steam\n\nValve very lazily tried once and gave up at the slightest of pushback.\n\nSomething about anti-trust... monopolies... something about that\n\nA secondary launcher in and of itself isn't problematic imo. Games like Darktide/Vermintide use a \"launcher\" mostly to deal with mods and outside-game settings before actually loading the game and it's actually added value because of this.\n\nHaving the secondary launcher just be another storefront a la Ubi or Origin though, that not only requires a secondary/external account just so you can click \"Play\" again? That can fuck right off.\n\nRan into a similar problem with Rockstar.  Have never played my copy of RDR2 because I have an email address I can't recover, never mind I went back and forth with them for six months with screenshots verifying my ownership.\n\nI just built a computer and tried getting Red Dead2. It didn't work because of Rockstars' stupid launcher. I ended up refunding it and got Devil May Cry 5 instead.\n\nTry pirate it. Pirate version ran way better than the one I bought on my pc \n\nAlso, I feel like piracy is pretty low risk if you legitimately bought the game. What are they gonna do, sue you for playing the game you bought in a way they don't like?\n\nPiracy is zero risk if you do it correctly.\n\nSame with EA. They changed my account's email at some point during a time I didn't play their games. (I know this for a fact, because I've only had 3 email addresses in 30 years of using the internet)\n\nThey refuse to look in to how it happened, and as a result my EA account and anything connected to it is fully bricked. It even affects my gamepass because that bricked account is linked to it and Microsoft can't unlink it, only EA can.\n\nReason why I love GOG f any DRM or clients. press exe to play the game. \n\nThat can't be right. I've been told here that piling on multiple launchers creates no problems whatsoever.\n\nDon't have to worry about multiple launchers if you only use GOG\n\nUnfortunately the reason is that the games using additional launchers simply aren't released on GOG. I have GOW 2018 on there, but I'm pretty sure I'll never see Ragnarok. Nor any Ubisoft games newer than the first Splinter Cell.\n\nThe DRM free position is not one you can take without sacrifice, that's for sure. I have resigned myself to just not buying some games I otherwise would want to buy.\n\n\nMy hope is that more people will do that. If everyone did, companies like ubisoft would have no choice but to go drm free or die.\n\n\nI have made one guilty exception with deep rock galactic because steam isnt terrible and DRG has a great respect-the-player design principles.\n\nRight there with you brother. I'm more than happy being \"limited\" to GOG's catalog if it means never ever having to deal with DRM, including having to be constantly online to play a damn thing.\n\nI say \"limited\" but there are more than enough great games on GOG that I've been a happy gamer playing that way for 10 years now, with very rare exceptions for games like Outer Wilds.\n\nCyberpunk and baldurs gate, hell yeaaaaah!\n\n\nAlso, elder scrolls games seem to make it there eventually. \n\nI'm GoG or Steam period at this point and I've still got to be careful about the Steam games not having another launcher hidden in them. There are enough games out there that I can skip some decent titles I might have otherwise bought.\n\nWhile Steam's a bit worse about it than GOG Gaben said that if Valve kicks the bucket at some point, they have a killswitch to disable all Steam DRM releasing every game that ever was on Steam\n\nthis is corporate speak for ''we will never do it''\n\nYeah, if that happens the update will be something like:\n\n*Unfortunately our lawyers tells us we actually can't do that, sorry bro, we asked them reaaaaaly nice, but they wouldn't budge. Also, we wanted to give you CS/TF2/Dota2/Deadlock/Portal/Ricoshet, but ownership of our entire portfolio was handed over to our creditors yesterday and they say that y'all can go fuck yourselves.*\n\nThe big asterisk is probably something like they'll kick every client into offline mode and you'll never be able to play an online game, move your Steam install to another computer or upgrade the mobo so your whole pre-existing installation will immediately have a ... half-life :3\n\nIt's not exactly as I said, but they \"have plans\" for the unlikely event that Steam ever goes down that \"you will have access to the games\" as far as I found on the Steam sub\n\nProbably, but it doesn't really matter anyway, because Steam DRM is awful and every game using it gets pirated on the day of its release.\n\nlol sure. It won't magically update your stuff on your PC, it would still require some connection to realize they hit that \"kill switch\". Which they would never do in the first place.\n\nI can't wait for the day they delete that garbage launcher and i can just launch those games. \n\njust kidding when ubisoft collapses most likely all games will be removed from existence\n\nThat's why I don't buy them. Even if they don't collapse, what are the odds they're just gonna remove games? I don't trust them to always be there so I just don't get interested in them.\n\nThey will have uplay uninstall their games before shutting down their download servers.\n\n[removed]\n\nIll start to be happy not owning their games, Ill see for the others after.\n\nYears ago I got an issue when transitioning to their environment and they refused to help me. I lost a couple of AC games only, so I'm not too concerned as I only really liked the first one but I never bought one of their games on PC again. I bought Rayman Origins on console though and that's basically it, not a single Ubisoft since then.\n\nWait since when did The Division 2 have Steam achievements?\n\nUbisoft some how gets worse every year\n\nThat Yves guy is a cancer for this company.\n\nThen you should never buy a Rockstar game again. 2K also. And also any games that still have Denuvo. \n\nThese all require online periodical authentication.\n\nPeople really put up with the weirdest shit when it comes to video games.\n\n\nImagine buying anything else and they pull this shit off, like say a blender or a coffee machine. People would rightfully tell them to fuck off.\n\n300+ comments and not one about the actual issue.\nClassic Reddit \n\nUplay logs out on its own all the time and often glitches out when you want to start a game from a different launcher, like Steam.\nMost times it would be because Steam is trying to start a game in the Uplay launcher that is not logged in or correctly updated. \nIt's usually recommended to only start the game from Uplay launcher, make sure the game is updated and you can verify files if you haven't already.\n\n&gt; 300+ comments and not one about the actual issue\n\nThe actual issue is the rigamarole of a second launcher that screws up. This person clearly was not asking for tech support.\n\nI like how you give a solution that might or might not work because Uplay is that goddamn horrible. Sometime it works perfect, half of the time it doesn't.\n\nI don't get why people shit on different launchers so much.\nLike yes Steam is the best one by far, but for me the other ones don't really matter much , its just start the launcher , makes sure you are logged in correctly and the game is updated and verified, click play and thats it.\n\nI don't think I had any real issues with any launcher in the last 10 years.\n\nPeople are still buying Ubisoft games...?\n\ngiven the amount of posts on reddit  about this very issue, the reason is the user linking the wrong account or not having ubi connect runnin in 99% of cases\n\nthis was just an excuse to post yet another bandwagon hate thread, because they had a user error problem...\n\nmost times it's exactly this issue/fix 🤦\n\n^(but don't let facts and truth disrupt the hate train: ubisoft bad upvote farm here)\n\nHad this happened and it took two minutes to fix. Hate on them for all the upvotes you want, but at least try…\n\nI don't know how Ubisoft is even in business anymore. That's how bad they are. Too big to fail, I guess.\n\nthey are failing pretty hard right now tho. stock still in freefall, they are finally starting to admit mistakes in business practices\n\nThey have fallen so bad that investors want the higher ups gone and for it to go private.\n\n&gt; for it to go private.\n\nNo, they just want the higher ups gone to try to pump up stock value unrealistically again.\n\nRemember, Ubi stocks were at a level of multi-billion-dollar corporations that sold thousands of products and services at one point. They want that price point back.\n\nSorry, singular investor wants to go private. Point being is that it is fuck enough. https://aj-invest.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ubisoft-Open-Letter.pdf\n\nHeh. Ubi, and to a lesser extent the rest of the industry, is in the finding out stage. \n\nIf you're listening: we're tired of being fucked around - just give us your product, on all the storefronts and without excessive and overbearing DRM.\n\nTime to rename this sub to r/ubihate and be done with it.\n\nOh no, the authentication sever is having issues..\n\nThat's a problem that no other gaming company will ever have at all, quick.jump ship fast\n\nThe error Op is getting is not server issue. Op has logged into a Ubisoft account that is different to the one Steam has on record and is linked to their Steam account.\n\nI mean say what you want about Ubisofts practices, but the amount of brain dead in these comments when OP is literally creating the problem themselves by not being signed into the right account. People really think they just yoinked their ability to play the game when it’s pretty clear what’s happening and 1 min google search solves the problem. Nah better post on Reddit self-reporting how technologically inept they are I guess.\n\nIf this happened to any normal person it would be fixed in under 2 minutes and game played without issue like the minor inconveniencenever happened.\n\n Instead we be a \"ubisoft bad huh? post with an image that, let's be honest, could've been intentionally done just to take the screenshot.\n\nyeah, I sometimes have issues with certain games during Steam weekly maintenance.\n\nSaying something negative of Steam? How dare you have any upvotes!\n\nYeah I have this issue just about every time I run RDR2.  For some reason the fix I found online was to run a CPU-Z stress test while the game does the authentication check.\n\nLmao you were buying Ubisoft games?\n\nBecause of a bug when launching the game one time?\n\nOh look another Ubisoft post.\n\nDivision 2 has been in a weird spot since they resurrected it from the dead.  A skeleton crew of devs have been working on it adding content and continually running into stumbling blocks they have to workaround because of the old programming.  It’s like this live service game was meant to die a long time ago.\n\nThat said, it’s a really fun game and I can’t believe how much content is available.  Hell, it’s easily doubled the amount of content since launch, much of that was free, and now a lot of it is because they opened up seasons to players without the DLC.  I’d gladly jump into TD2 anytime.\n\nClose ubisoft connect completely (not only to symbol in taskbar) and try again.\n\nWanted to play assassins creed a few months ago. I logged in to the launcher only to find out they have removed all my games even though i bought it. Same shit with EA launcher\n\nPersonally, I wouldn't buy an Ubisoft game on PC. They seem to work fine on Console(Playstation) even if I don't sign up for the Uplay account."

    "all_comment_text": "It turns out it's hard to run a gaming platform, especially when you have to compete with steam. Steam was designed to compete with *downloading games for free* by offering server browsing, cloud saves, and modding support. Trying to implement that all from scratch is going to cost a lot, and that makes the valve cut seem a lot more reasonable.\n\nand **maintain**. I don't think maintenance gets discussed a lot because it's the least visible, when things work nothing gets mentioned, when things go wrong maintainers get vilified.\n\nConstantly having to keep an eye out for security threats, keep various dependencies up to date on multiple OSes, data backups and many other things I can't even imagine takes people with domain expertise, time and money.\n\nI remember a quote that when a certain game's update was released on Steam (I forget, probably an MMORPG or a MOBA), steam accounted for a % on the two digits of total simultaneous global internet traffic.\n\nBefore steam, the ut2k3 demo and other demo downloads would routinely account for 10-20% of all internet traffic for the first few hours after release.\n\nI too am old\n\nedit: only took three edits to complete this statement properly\n\n\"Death is but a door.  Time is but a window.  I'll be back.\"  - Vigo the Carpathian\n\n...just before his head died.\n\nWell that's what happens when one comes back to life and picks New York pal! That wouldn't have happened if he had brain one in that huge melon on top of his neck, living the sweet life out in Southern California's beautiful San Fernando Valley\n\nMan that demo was a blast though.\n\n\"I am old\"\n\n\"I am too old\"\n\n\"I too am old\"\n\nThough that was also before widespread video on the internet, when \"downloading software\" was pretty much the most bandwidth-intensive thing you'd do with the internet.\n\nAnd porn. \n\nAfter all, the internet is for porn... Isn't it?\n\nIt was Dota 2, back around 2016 or 2017.\n\nSteam moved more gigs of digital goods than anyone on earth, at one point. More than iTunes more than Spotify. It may still be true.\n\nProbably not anymore with streaming video. Game files are big, but they're a one and done. Any data transmitted for multiplayer is pretty miniscule.\n\nMeanwhile, 1 hour of 1080P youtube uses 1.5 GB of data, and 4k will double that to 3 GB.\n\nSo if someone watches an hour or two of youtube / netflix / whatever every day, they're pulling down at least a terabyte of data every year.\n\nMaintaining is often overlooked.  \nEveryone always has money to create things, but never think of the maintenance cost.  This is true in many domains like IT, construction etc.  \nHow many times did you look at a building, and think \"how are they going to clean that window\"?  Now imagine having to clean that window ever so often for 40 years.\n\nAs a home owner this hits so hard. I rage at anything ‘custom.’ Can’t even imagine it on a much larger scale.\n\nYes lmao. Give me the most boring square box with simple, accessible features.\n\nAnd ACCESS PANNELS.  PUT THE PLUMBING SOMEWHERE ACCESSABLE, NOT THE EXTERIOR WALL\n\n\\* twitch \\*\n\nThis must be a thing for places where it doesn't get that cold. If you put plumbing on the exterior walls where I live, the pipes would probably freeze.\n\nIt did and they did.  Freezing around here is normal.  \n\nThere were signs this had happened before, but the underlying issue wasn't fixed.\n\nThe pipe was inaccessible and I had to shut off the water main, then smash a hole to get to the pipe to fix it.\n\nI've improved the insulation and added air circulation, but it's the best I can do without a major renovation.\n\nHappened at my mom's house in Illinois.\n\nThe pipe in the wall to the water heater burst and took a bit to realize where the water was coming from.\n\nShe now has a cutout of the drywall to the repaired pipe and just keeps the door to that utility room open during the winter to make sure it doesn't ever get too cold in that room\n\nA thousand times this. Everything needs access panels without having to cut holes.\n\n[deleted]\n\nLocal school district did this years ago. Signed up with a tech vendor (great sales commission for that guy I'm sure) and bought a Chromebook for every kid, computers and charge carts for teachers, school-wide Wi-Fi for every school, and \"smart boards\", which are white boards with projectors and you can use digital pens to write on the board digitally and interact and stuff.\n\nZERO budgeting for maintenance. Or close to it. They had ONE IT guy for the whole district. Wifi went down? Maybe he'll get to you within the week, deal with it till then. A Chromebook isn't working? Teachers just had to Google and try to figure it out themselves or else the kid couldn't do work. Projector bulb goes out? You _might_ get it replaced by _next_ school year, but you may as well just give up on it, because you may actually _never_ get it replaced.\n\nThey used the excuse of COVID restrictions lifting to take all the Chromebooks away. Now the kids get no computer training at all, and as we know from Gen Zers entering the workplace, that means they'll have zero necessary skills, they'll be largely computer illiterate.\n\nPeople always question \"wtf is IT doing why do we have them?\" and \"they are worthless smelly nerds lol they can die see if i care\". I see this here on reddit pretty often.\n\nBut they always come back with fake smiles on their faces.\n\nFrom what I've seen from kids raised on chromebooks id rather have them learn on nothing. Chromebooks are just portals to the Internet. They don't teach you how to use windows or Mac. They can't even teach you how to install a program cause they dont do it.\n\nI had a friend who found a volnurability on origin (install and run programs on anyone on your friends list as long as they’re online) and tried to see if he could get a small standardized payout like most big tech companies offer if you can find something like that. Steam would’ve paid him but EA had no such offer, so he ended up just not telling them.  \nWonder how long that hole in the wall lasted.\n\nPaying community white hats to plug vulnerabilities is such a basic part of large platforms that it's mad to me that any big companies don't do it. It could cost you a few hundred grand a year to run and save you millions in exploits never used by malicious actors.\n\nBut who has the foresight to see a payoff in the long run? /s\n\nMy dad talks about finding a vulnerability on the printer at his summer job in college. He went to the boss and the boss didn’t care until he showed up at the next pay period with a duplicate copy of everyone’s paycheck. The printer wasn’t clearing data after it finished a print job and so he could repeat the most recent print. That story got him his first real job and he’s worked in network security the past 40 years.\n\nProbably just put a poster over the hole with \"don't look behind poster\" on it\n\nIt’s a load bearing poster\n\nCouldn't play anything on the Xbox PC client yesterday for 4 hours because their backend was down. I've never experienced anything like that with Steam.\n\n[deleted]\n\nI mean… just login before 6 EST on tuesdays.\n\n[deleted]\n\nA lot of people don’t remember, or never knew, what it was like to maintain stand-alone games on their computer. I only know most of what I know about computer troubleshooting because of dealing with random breaks whenever a system or driver update happened. There was no concept of the publisher fixing their game until maybe WoW and Steam made it popular - until then a game came out and it was “done”, at least as much as it was ever going to be.\n\nRemoving most of that burden, to me, will always be worth what Steam asks from me, because at the end of the day I just want to play the damn game.\n\nFor PC games at least, there were patches... if you even heard about them and could find where to download them. King's Quest 8 had an important item you just could not obtain unless you got a patch to fix the bug, but a lot of people never patched because this was before everyone even had an internet connection.\n\nYes, that's why  videogames magazines with cd-rom were so popular at that time, we had demos, patches and softwares on it.\n\nThe fun days of when you had to find the patches yourself and carefully read the instructions to see if you had to be on a specific software version of the game before installing that specific patch.\n\nOh, and it's not like it was unheard of for official sources for the patches to stop hosting older patches you had to be in the know and make use gamecopyworld.com  if you needed an older patch for whatever reason.\n\nSteam is fucking amazing. For 100 bucks and like 30% cut, they'll distribute your game and all it's updates around the world forever.\n\nDon't you also get the 100 bucks back when you hit some sales milestone?\n\nIIRC its goes to around 20% after you reach the milestone. Can't remember the number but its a number only AAA should expect.\n\nYou get the 100 bucks back after $1000 of Adjusted Gross Revenue.\n\nAnd cloud saves, and a custom content distribution platform, and an entire system for matchmaking and both P2P and dedicated server multiplayer, and anti-cheat, and persistent player item inventories, and a VR framework, and an input device framework, and player stats and achievements, and a lot more. It's totally fair to argue that the cut is higher than it could be, but you do get a lot of platform features in return.\n\nOh yeah I also forgot remote play together. So you can design your game as couch coop, and steam will just be like, add a few lines of code so anybody can hop in remotely, no netcode required on your part.\n\nObviously it's not for everything, but it can really save a smaller developer a lot of time and hassle for a decently reliable feature.\n\nIt's amazing for online multiplayer games from small developers too. People underestimate how much of a hassle it is to deal with orchestration, security, NAT traversal, and endpoint management, and having Steam do all that means that multiplayer can stay alive even if the developer doesn't.\n\nThe cut's also bog-standard for the industry. 30% profit margin is pretty typical for retail in general, and from what I've read PSN, XBL, and the Nintendo Store all take similar percentages.\n\nThe only reason people know or care about Steam's is because Epic used it as a marketing point.\n\n&gt; The only reason people know or care about Steam's is because Epic used it as a marketing point.\n\nThis is what I have encountered as well. If you ask any developer, the 30% cut is absolute peanuts compared to the RoI from simply having your game on a platform like Steam. The only people making waves about it in the media are publishers/platforms like Epic that are trying to drive a wedge between consumers and Steam with an astroturfing press campaign. People get so hung up on the 30%, but never even bother to think what that 30% gets you.\n\nIt's been interesting seeing indie dev's and some redditors trying to argue against Steam's 30% cut. PC's aren't consoles, if you don't like steam's policy just sell your game on your own website.\n\nIndies who whine about steam's cut are frankly morons. Ask them how much they think they would've got during CD pressing days. 30% cut? You'd ***see*** 30% after distribution and publishers are done with you unless you've got a bangin contract. That's what Valve was competing against. We didn't have cloud services, file hosting web hosting domain purchasing all that junk if you wanted to fly solo, *good luck* getting a market.\n\nSteam literally opened pandora's box for the whiny schmuck to even have the opportunity to live his gamedev dreams. Pay your dues and shut up.\n\nUbi, Blizzard, and the rest thought their customers would ignore having subpar launchers because their games were fun. But part of what made those games so enjoyable was Steam making it easy to buy and play.\n\nI think it’s more just the visibility of being on steam. \n\nGames CAN be successful on a different launcher. Wow, Fortnite, for example. But it needs to be exceptionally popular. Diablo 4 moved over 10 million copies before it ever hit Steam, as another example.\n\nGames that haven’t entered the zeitgeist like those titles suffer from the average consumer not really knowing it exists or has released. Being blasted on the Steam homepage goes a long way towards people seeing that a game exists/knowing that it’s finally released (because of steams baseline popularity).\n\nI am hard pressed to believe the average consumer gives anywhere near as much of a shit about multiple launchers as we do on Reddit. They just don’t check the storefronts on other launchers like they do on steam.\n\nI treat the Battle.net launcher as just the wow client with extra steps. Granted played WoW before steam was the juggernaut it is  so I'm conditioned. I still remember back in the day gamers were pissed about the Steam Launcher even being a thing.\n\nYeah, there was a post on a subreddit a few days ago where someone was asking why Steam was so universally adopted and if it was necessary to PC game. \n\nThe thing I tried to emphasize (strongly) was just how much WORK valve does in the background to make your games launch at the push of a button. I mean, the Steam Deck literally is just a small computer that runs Linux. And the amount of libraries and stuff it downloads on a regular basis just so I can play my games smoothly is impressive.\n\nSteam monopolized the distribution market on PC without using anti-competitor tactics, without the modern \"draw them in, crank up the price\" tactics of most new \"industry disrupters\", but instead by just genuinely offering consumer value. The cost is passed on to developers, but clearly, the massive user base of Steam outweighs that cost, as seen by the repeated attempts to break away resulting in coming back.\n\nSteam is one of the ONLY companies I know that actually upholds the \"capitalist\" ideal of \"if you innovate and have the best product, you will win.\"\n\nEA had to redo their little client and replace the old one due to maintenance issues. Proper coding is key\n\n[deleted]\n\nThe new EA app is really an even worse piece of crap. It runs as multiple services at start up eating up resources, it is another bloated ElectronJS app which just runs a full chromium browser for all the crappy CSS and webframework support. Every UI update is like a new webpage call instead of running smoothly natively properly utilising your system, every UI update requires the app the go evaluate all the crappy JS and HTML/CSS code. And there's also a shit ton of security holes they introduce in your system with the way the app is built and runs.\n\nAll because they wanted to cheap out on maintenance and hire cheaper devs (probably low wage country devs like India if I had to guess). I'm sure this is the real reason, having worked as developer for 10+ years now.\n\nIt's really in every way worse than the Origin launcher and that was considered a piece of crap by everyone. In Origin if you knew how to work around minor bugs you could atleast properly join friends in game, view stats, now half the time the EA app just fully breaks and is unusable lol.\n\nOnly reason I use it is because I love battlefield.\n\nNot to mention how many PC gamers simply have a blindness to any game that isn't on Steam.\n\nThere's a reason the Epic Game Store gets called a \"marketing black hole\".\n\nBecause there is not a platform like steam.\n\nEpic where huge assholes trying to get the \"console exclusives\" into the PC world, so no way I go there regardless of how many free shit they throw at me.\n\nEA's platform lacked the most basic of functionalities, I couldn't even gift a game to someone else, only could buy for me. Thats a feature that'd made them money, imagine having returns or family sharing or whatever else that costs money...\n\nSteam has kept PC gaming alive and gave it a new life with the whole indie scene, which now we take for granted. It is still the better platform to make it out from nowhere.\n\nAnd ubisoft's shit... however it was called, that was a glorified launcher rather than a platform or even store, even Blizzard's launcher had more thought put into it. They also did me dirty by creating without my knowledge or consent a new account after watch dogs, so any game I had on their platform before that got lost because they refused to merge the accounts despite being tied to the same steam account, they couldn't be arsed and were huge assholess about it, so good riddance IMO.\n\nI do purchase stuff from GOG ocasionally and they are alright to me, but any other \"store\" or the like  that has tried has been utter shit.\n\nIts not that \"PC gamers refuse to look elsewhere\" is that the rest of the stuff is pure garbage and they dont even try.\n\nI've used GOG and Steam this whole time. I never bothered to even learn about others. All because I'm burnt out. If I have to sign up or subscribe to one more thing I will scream.\n\nI use GOG primarily because I like their DRM free downloads and they hooked me years ago with their access to classic games.  Steam I use for games I can't get on GOG, or that run better with the modding support from workshop.\n\nEpic I log in on once a week to get the free games and maybe once or twice a year they pony up something worth installing.\n\nI actively avoid purchasing anything that requires it's own installer.  If you're a piece of shit company like EA or Ubisoft there's a solid chance your quad-A game will be free on ps+ within the year, so I'll wait for that or just not play your skinner boxes masquerading as games.\n\n&gt;I do purchase stuff from GOG ocasionally and they are alright to me, but any other \"store\" or the like that has tried has been utter shit.\n\nThe only reason GOG works while all the others are failing is because they are selling something different from Steam (DRM-free games, edit : and old games). None of these other competing platforms offered something different than what Steam is offering. Humble Bundle could maybe have their own platform since they are selling something different (bundles, charity, books) and if someone came up with a platform allowing trading and/or lending games, they might be able to have some success.\n\nAlso being very hands-off in general. You download/install the game and from there on out you never have to interact with GOG again if you don't want to. No demands to dig up your old password to log in, no \"you need to update our client before launching the game,\" you tell the game to run and it runs.\n\nThat and they have a lot of older games that aren't published on Steam. They'll also put out their own or community made patches to keep those games running.\n\nThey also carved out a niche of selling old games that couldn't be bought on Steam.\n\nOh yeah true, I forgot about GOG because I have only like two games on there but I had pretty good experiences with them as well.\n\nIt's excellent for older games, I have probably like 100 over there and playing stuff that might normally require some tinkering without having to worry about that is just great.\n\nWhenever I get the urge to replay something like Nox or M&amp;M7 GoG is the way to go.\n\nThey have also managed to get almost all the old games that I really wanted ease of access to. I think they are only missing like handful of them anymore and even added some fringe titles like Cyberstorm in recent years.\n\nI just hope that they manage to untangle the license and rights hell that still plague some titles and prevents them from getting added.\n\nLike someone said. It seems like valve's business strategy is just watch everyone else shoot themselves in the foot\n\nValve has the benefit of not having to answer to shareholders demanding ever increasing stock prices. That tends to cause companies to make stupid moves for short term gains and that causes the foot shootings.\n\nTheir strategy is to constantly improve their client to remain on top of their competition. The \"Gabe does nothing\" take is asinine. Gabe runs faster than anyone else to remain the top dog, up to designing and maintaining their own Linux fork.\n\nWhen Borderlands 3 launched it was an Epic Game exclusive for 6 months before it got to Steam. That just meant its launch date was 6 months later with extra beta testing before I bought it.\n\nAll my games already work like that anyways. When the first sale hits, I know the beta testing period is over.\n\nPatience is a virtue.\n\nIf you’re perpetually 5y behind on games you get to run them at the highest vid settings easily. And your expectations are 5y behind too. Heck some 20+y old games still rock.\n\n[deleted]\n\nWhich is insane because they just had to copy most of steams features and I’m betting a lot of people could be persuaded due to the free games they also offered. Epic definitely has the money to do so. But for some reason they just don’t add most of the beloved steam features.\nAt least that was the status quo when I last checking the EGS a few months ago.\n\nIt's more than \"just copy features\" though. There are two major issues:\n\n1.  there is a set list of features that MUST be copied - which are expensive and difficult to do (basically the stuff /u/hearing_aid_bot mentioned). Building and maintaining support for purchases (including easy payment, and managing download speeds), cloud saves, and servers is a LOT of infrastructure. It is tempting to push implementing these later down the pipeline when there is more money to work with, but delaying them makes a new system feel inferior and less convenient\n1.  because Steam's whole system is based on convenience, a new system also needs marketing to get visible - while I don't like all of their methods, I do think Epic did achieve this part, most gamers are aware of the store and a fair number joined for free games\n\nAs a side note, it is also important to make the system feel unobtrusive. Epic games honestly still feels like malware, and that's just management of CPU resources and how in your face the UI is. GOG does a good job of being unobtrusive and convenient, and while they don't offer all of the features steam has, the features they don't have are offset by their offer of being DRM-free (which is a different approach to the customer).\n\nAs far as your \"feels like intrusive Malware\" topic, another aggravating thing is that doe some games you aren't even given access/downloaded the full game files. EGS needs to be running as a go-between. If EGS crashes or stops, the game will to because its constantly verifying that EGS is running. I had this issue with Snowrunner and trying to get it to stream to my Steam Deck docked as a HTPC. There was no \"snowrunner.exe\" I could point remote play to, so I had to set up the EGS launcher with a command line to immediately launch SnowRunner when I launched EGS. So essentially I had to stream EGS itself. \n\nNow I only had this one game, but imagine an entire EGS library and if you wanted to stream something else you would have to modify that command line every time? It was a fucking nightmare, to the point that I bought the entire game again on Steam when it came on sale and haven't looked back.\n\nI don't know that I'm in the majority here, but that wouldn't work for me either. I use very few of Steam's features, I'm a solo gamer for the most part. What I want is essentially a game manager where all my games are and can easily be purchased and managed. Steam offers that, so no other service can offer it for me. Because as soon as they try, they failed: I already have that. Any game that gets released exclusively on this new platform, I'll simply ignore. Same way I ignore console exclusives.\n\nIf Steam was doing me dirty in any way, I'd cheer for more options and competition. But it's not, and I can't think of anything anyone could do to make me switch to a different product that does the exact same thing.\n\nSteam and gog are the gold standard for gaming platforms, no other platform has really ever competed with them in their respective niches.  Steam is so big for valve they barely even make video games anymore they make so much through steam.\n\nIt's kind of amazing, given how universally hated Steam was back in its initial days. They really put their all into the platform.\n\nYeah. I went from \"fuck, I have to install this piece of shit 'steam' thing for this crack to work\" to 14k$ spent over the course of 15 years. And god damn, now steam even allowed me to realise my dream of running fucking Linux on my pc and still play my games\n\nMy first time using Steam was back when you could do something to get free access to every game available, something about installing an e-cafe version of it? Can't remember exactly, but it was fucking dope lol.\n\nAgreed they're both leagues ahead of everyone else. GOG is above Steam IMO simply because it's DRM-free and focuses on your ownership when you buy a game. If we were ranking platforms GOG would be by #1 followed closely by Steam.\n\nIt doesn't help that other launchers are just weak compared to steam. Look at EGS, the biggest competitor, which still lacks so many functions steam has.\n\nMy biggest issue and the reason I’ll never use EGS is because I play games on my laptop while using an external storage drive for more storage and for whatever reason epic is incapable of finding my storage drive. There’s no excuse to have an issue like this in your game launcher\n\nWeird, I can install to my D drive just fine.\n\nwhen i install it then it works fine until i de attach the drive but when i plug it in again it can never find it for some reason. maybe its a skill issue on my  part but i've even tried fixes online and the only thing that works is just completely redownloading it each time which just isn't worth it\n\nEvery time I go on Epic to pick up a free game, I'm reminded how bad and lacking Epic is. Can't even see a list of your owned games on the website easily!\n\nAnd people keep asking why valve doesn't make games anymore.\n\nLike, they're probably a bit busy.\n\nValve has about the same output as any other game studio.\n\nThey're just not a publisher, and they're allergic to the number 3. They just released a Smite-clone into early access, didn't they?\n\nAbsolutely, I'd rather pay for a game to have all the conveniences Steam offers available than get it for free usually, but I'd rather not play a game at all than have to even download the Ubisoft launcher.\n\nThe funny thing is that costs a lot, but places like Epic didn't even *try*. despite having one of the most lucrative games in history.  Rome wasn't built in a day, but people sure as hell had intent to build it.  They only tried to attack Valve and punish them for making a better service.\n\nMicrosoft gamepass is a pretty decent competing service because they offer a lot of interesting features like cloud gaming, gaming overlay with a bunch of great QoL features (I use the volume mixer even when not playing games).  $12 is a pretty good entry price that gets a lot of new releases and popular indie games, it probably will eventually turn to crap, but I find it a fun partner to my steam library.\n\nThe industry as a whole though is fixing to push people back to piracy though.  Charging $70 for incomplete or buggy/unplayable products is pushing consumers to their brink.  We're going to get a lot more games like concord and starwars outlaw, losing hundreds of millions and industry leads scratching their heads.\n\n[deleted]\n\nIt doesn't help that every time a publisher tries to make their own platform, they don't make something for customers to easily see and launch their games. They make an pop up ad program that you're forced to navigate to play the games you already paid money for. \n\nSteam has ads, but they're unintrusive and easily ignored if you aren't looking to buy. It's easy to click over to your library and have nothing shoved in your face.\n\ndazzling squeamish versed plants yoke thumb axiomatic fact skirt subsequent\n\nThey tried. I think you only really need it for quake champions though\n\nOriginally I think you needed it for Fallout 76, real convenient in that situation since it meant you didn’t get the refund system from Steam\n\nPlus no pesky reviews deterring customers.\n\nBlizzard is actually the odd one out in this comic, because they never left Steam. They just never put anything on it before until Overwatch, so they're technically new to Steam.\n\nThey wanted to keep Quake Champions and Fallout 76 on Bethesda Game Launcher. Both ended up on Steam a little later. I played Quake Champions alot back then and it came to Steam in August 2017. Time flies.\n\nQuake Champions was such a a disappointment for me. The fact that they set out to make it appeal to a much wider audience alienated most of the vets and at the same time it still alienated the non vets because it was Quake enough to make sure newer players would still just get curbstomped by everyone whose been playing the franchise for two decades already lol\n\nOnce a year I load up quake champions to make use of micro transactions that I regret and I get absolutely smashed by the vets that still hang on. I have like 250 hours and I really like the game. But there are no casual gamers playing it anymore so it's no fun.\n\nThat's been quake pretty much since I was a kid, you got tossed into the meat grinder and bashed your head against the wall until you could compete or quit, whichever came first! I persevered and made it to the top clans in a few mods and won a decent amount of tournaments and leagues, but eventually I took a decade long break and that was enough to ensure I fell forever behind because I'm not going through that shit again to get back up to par lol\n\nOh yeah, a long time ago... One of the worst launchers out there. Loaded for like 5 minutes then it took 10 minutes to close...\n\nI wanted a quick game of mfing quake, not all of that...\n\nThank god they've killed that abomination\n\nAm i wrong in thinking Blizzard never left Steam? They where just late to the party in the first place\n\nYou are correct. BattleNet actually predates Steam, and tends to get a pass since the launcher itself is very light and more or less only exists for game patching. They get a pass in my eyes, since the decision to start publishing their content on Steam as well seems like the exact opposite of anti-consumer. Even though Overwatch 2 got review bombed for basically killing a perfectly good game to replace it with a free to play version of the same game with a lot of microtransactions\n\nLots of games back in the day had launchers. Especially when they first started connecting to the internet.\n\nalso perhaps some of blizzard's games (well,  a  game - world of warcraft) have a particular game file system of their own, and it either wouldn't be manageable via the way that steam handles game updates (and/or would require it's own updater anyway, like some games/mmos on steam do), or wouldn't have it's own benefits like playing game while it's downloading\n\nOk\nIt's time\n\nWe need to build lord Gaben a throne like the emperor has in Warhammer 40k\n\nWho's gonna organize the Kickstarter?\n\nOnly if it includes life support to keep him alive.\n\n[deleted]\n\nIt will go public if Gabe's successor will screw up managing the company. Steam is pretty much THE launcher on PC. So it will generate profit as long as it's properly maintained.\n\nIt would be the objectively wrong thing to screw over Steam users by making the platform shitty.\n\nSadly, companies lately have been known for doing the objectively wrong thing to screw over their customers.\n\nIt's like they feel good doing it. Companies want to be right more than they want money.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI wed comparing the same app, 4 years apart and Jesus it managed to become so much worse.\n\n&gt; Companies want to be right more than they want money.\n\nEvery middle manager and up in corpoland needs to \"make their mark\" and \"prove their importance\", especially as they enter a new position or company. This quite often takes the form of some weird change that they think on paper will be better but their lack of understanding of either the company or the users quite often just makes it yet another shitty forced nonsense change\n\nFlashbacks to the new high-school principal thinking the green wall in the hallway is ugly, and having it painted orange instead. (It was a green-screen.)\n\nSteam and Valve should be required material in MBA programs that shows what happens when you ignore basically _all_ of Jack Welch's horseshit that has infiltrated every rung of management in corporate America.\n\nBut it will never happen.\n\nIt's a product of the Jack Welch school of thought - always be changing and adapting and growing and never actually sit and learn deep intimate knowledge about your established business. Instead, always measure your employees and fire the lowest 10% of performers according to your metrics. Then employees start focusing squarely on those metrics instead of the health of the overall business and slowly your changes make less and less sense but you're still the industry standard because that's just the way it is.\n\nEvery middle management job I've ever taken has come with a \"management is really looking forward to seeing what fresh ideas you plan on bringing to the company\" speech, no training or assistance, and regular weekly meetings where they reference metrics and ask \"what changes are being made to help boost these numbers.\" \n\nIf you come back with \"it's a really good team and it's operating like a well-oiled machine\" or \"I think the only thing we can do at this point is increase staffing\", you get an angry one on one with your boss, and if you keep doing it or the numbers don't keep going up you get put on the list for the next downsizing. This mostly results in constant arbitrary changes and flailing until something sticks or the inevitable occurs.\n\nMiddle management exists solely to do management's job for them, take the blame for any problems or missed metrics, and to get fired when management wants to artificially increase the bottom line. Then they hire the position back after management's management starts asking them what changes they're making to \"boost these numbers\".\n\nIt's a self-cannibalizing system that eventually results in fail-upwards idiots, ass-kissers, and con artists populating the only tenured positions all the way up. And once the pipeline to the top is finally full of BS, they go bankrupt or sell the company to someone who cleans house and begins it all again. It's the CIIIIRCLE OF LIIIFE!\n\nIt's simply what you do if you have fuck-you levels of money on the stock market.\n\n1. Find a successful company that's doing well\n2. Buy tons of stock until you have a seat on the board of directors, your friends all do that same\n3. Prioritize short term profits over long term viability.\n4. Company makes record profits causing the stock price to rise\n5. Sell all your stock at the new higher price before you can feel the consequences of your actions\n6. Repeat as you leave another dying company in your wake.\n\nIt would be just another monetary mass to extract for the finance hivemind. It doesn't care about anything else and moves to the next mass to extract right after.\n\nMost companies will generate profit if properly maintained.\n\n\nDoesn't stop suits pushing stupid shit to maximize the profits for one quarters to please shareholders before jumping to another company and letting the first one crash and burn.\n\nThey have to justify their salaries; rather fidd excuses not sticking to the boring job of actually working to keep the product good.\n\nThe problem isn’t company profits \n\nIt’s maximizing company profits \n\nA company can have a decent margin and make a good profit of a few billion and the company will go “but why not a few MORE billion” \n\nIt’s how every company goes\n\nThe one aspect a Cloud Services friend of mine brought up that's of somewhat a concern in the long run is that the operating cost of Steam isn't exactly flat.\n\nIf you buy a game on Steam, they are (so far) guaranteeing that the game is not just available basically forever (barring a reason it gets pulled, and many reasons keep it in the library of someone who'd previously purchased it) but more importantly that it's available for immediate download at a fairly high rate of speed.\n\nThat's a VERY expensive capability to keep up, even ignoring cloud-saves for your save files.\n\nI predict at some point, probably after Gabe's successor takes over, that we'll start to see a bit of fragmenting of that kind of capability. For example, perhaps everyone has a base level of data storage for cloud saves just by having an account, but past a certain size you have to pay a small yearly fee for it. Or perhaps some games might even well end up put into a bit of a deeper storage. \"Oh? You want this game from 1999 that nobody has requested from us in 6 months? Sure you can queue that up, but it's going to be a slow download because that's on our cheaper/slower long term storage.\".\n\nYep, I am a data engineer that works with Azure. The more I look at steam as a technical resource the more I am impressed. The one thing I want to mention however, is that steam doesn't really use cloud like most companies. They are the native host. They maintain their own servers, software, and IP. They are running at a significantly lower cost due to good infrastructure design.\n\nAmazing what well paid and motivated employees can do for a company.\n\npot melodic mountainous outgoing jeans shelter square cover price offend\n\n[deleted]\n\n&gt; Of course if things start degrading that would likely not be the end of it.\n\nYup, I didn't want to get too immediately gloom-and-doomy. I just somewhat expect it would start with something like that and gradually advance from there.\n\nMaking profit isn't good enough, you need to make more profit than the previous quarter, over and over again, exponential growth until every last drop has been wrung out of the company and it is a withered husk of its former self, then sell it off for parts and move on to the next one.\n\nThat's the beauty of a private company. You don't need growth. Any profit made is profit.\n\nValve doesn't need growth because Valve is its own company.\n\nHe's 61, so with some good fortune, he should have another decade or two in reasonable health. Hopefully he's setting up someone with similar views as his successor.\n\nA successor is essential. Even more in non publicly traded companies.\n\ni mean, do we really expect him to work until he's 80 years old? 61 is close to retirement age, i wouldn't count on him working for another decade or two, especially if he doesn't have to.\n\nHere is me praying to Lord Gaben that he will simply set it up in a way where it is not possible to make it public after his death.\n\nDw he said he doesn't plan on ever dying so we are fine\n\nAFAIK his son is going to take over. So we're probably going to have a LOTR situation where it takes until the grandson takes over for things to get wierd.\n\nThe Golden throne in Warhammer 40k is a machine that has maintained the emperor’s “life” for thousands of years. \n\nThat he is in constant agony and requires thousands of psych mutants to be sacrificed every day to do so is immaterial. If the Emperor dies they can’t travel through the warp and their version of space travel becomes impossible. \n\nSo yea should work for Gabe.\n\nThe Warhammer lore is so wild.  \n\nyou just have to sacrifice up to 1000 GPUs per day to keep it working\n\nDo we also need to sacrifice 10,000 people a day or can we just collectively buy tf2 keys\n\nOne thousand streamers a day are sacrificed to maintain the Gaben's psychic strength.\n\nWho's gonna line up the souls of 10.000 counter strike players a day to keep Him and the Steamonomican alive when His time comes?\n\nDo we get to sacrifice 1000 VAC banned / cheaters a day to keep him alive in perpetuity?\n\nWhere's EA?\n\n[deleted]\n\nUbisoft and Blizzard in the sactum?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#The inner sanctum of hell\n\nhell is to good for EA, have you seen the heating costs? EA gets the VOID and the effort of throwing them into it was already an insult to us in having to have made.\n\ni was actually not sure if ea was part of the group but i should have put them in there as well\n\nActually EA is the first one who back to steam\n\nThey even brought their cash cow the sims with them wich was locked for like 8 years\n\nStill need to launch through their shitty launchers though lol what’s the point\n\nCivilization removing their launcher was a pleasant update recently.\n\nI know I hated that shitty fucking launcher. Sometimes I'd have to close the game and reopen it so I could play multiplayer.\n\nAfter adding it in the first plate ironically (and all the people defending the presence of it on Reedit).\n\nA game that comes with a shitty launcher or you have to sign up for another account. Instant refund.\n\nI don't buy them in the first place. Thank goodness that the info is visible in the store tab. The only exception I did was with games from Rockstar. Though with GTA IV I bought it when you had to activate with the games for windows live plugin.\n\nGames for Windows Lice are still a thing?\n\nI mean, some people just need to scratch that itch.\n\nI bought a physical copy of Bioshock 2 years ago, with an abysmal connexion process through Xbox live (on pc, mind you). Every launch was agony to make it run, crashes, lags and whatnot even though I only wanted to play the solo (remember Bioshock 2 multiplayer?!)\n\nEnded up buying it on Steam out of rage so I could run it smoothly.\n\nWhy does blizzard have the hat too? i dont remember them leaving steam in the past at all. didnt they just recently start adding their games to steam, like Diablo 4?\n\n[battle.net](http://battle.net) literally predates steam lol its fun to hate on Blizzard cause they suck but its the only alternate launcher I don't hear people whine about\n\nThat's because it just kinda works and is pretty slimmed down.  \n\nI've never had an issue getting the things I play on it to launch. I've heard complaints when Destiny and CoD were added but they kinda exist in their own microcosm and while there's some crossover it's mostly isolated from each other.\n\nIt's a launcher that has a relatively low startup time, seems to be mostly there to patch games, has a relatively good interface (not a high bar to be fair with most interfaces these days beeing extremely bad...) and doesn't eat up a ton of processing power for absolutely no reason. I've seen launchers eat up as much as &gt;20% of CPU while idle because it absolutely needed that stupid video looping in the background which may or may not have been a video file or pixels manually moved by the program. Srsly Riot what was that slipup of performance?  \nIt's like having a user friendly interface would actually make people more chill about the extra step.\n\nI assume because of the Activision Blizzard merger where for a while the new CoD games were on battle.net but not steam which they have since reversed on. Idk why they picked blizzard over activision, but they are one company now\n\nGOG in heaven looking down on all of them.\n\nGOG holds a special place for me and whenever applicable I buy from them because I honour their goal of having people actually own their games, which is something no one else does anymore.\n\nPreach.\n\nIt's got some blind spots (like being behind on patches), but where else can you download the INSTALLERS for your games and archive them locally for the impending apocalypse?\n\nalso cause they saw a niche (old games) and supported that. i accept that they branched out into regular games, cause it doesn't affect me at all\n\nThey were the only place where I could legally obtain Medal of Honor Allied Assault (and both expansions) that I had CD Keys from my War Chest set.\n\n\nI was too lazy to install an optical drive into my PC\n\nWhatever happened to those guys? They've been silent lately.\n\nAutumn sale is on right now.  Just got Whispering Willows free, and there's a discount code in their newsletter for Deus Ex.\n\nLately? They're as good as ever, I don't think they've ever been quiet.\n\nStill in support and development by CD Projekt Red.\n\nAlthough when the commenter meant heaven he probably meant the store's policy is way much better. AKA Steam accepts games protected with DRM while GOG don't.\n\nThough there whas a few month ago a user survey from GoG if the user would want more games in the trade off to only be mostly DRM free instead of completely DRM free.  \nUsers where not happy and they pulled this idea away just like Microsoft with the Always Online XBox.\n\nas they should. The only reasons gog is hyped is because its drm free.\n\n[deleted]\n\nThey are just chilling. It's not making a lot of money but it's surviving. Funnily enough CDPR games makes them a ton of money. I think almost 10% of Cyberpunk PC sales was on GOG. That alone makes it worth it for CDPR. If Ubisoft released their games DRM free I'm 100% sure people would have used their launcher to buy games and it would have had more sales. But nope....\n\n[deleted]\n\nBlizzard being included this sits poorly with me as they never had games on steam to begin with or if I am misremembering (I highly doubt) it'd have been 20+ years. \n\nUbisoft was recently.\n\nNot sure why Blizzard is there since they were never on Steam to begin with and I think Ubisoft never left?\n\nUbisoft never completely left, they just had delayed Steam releases.\n\nI worry for steam when gabens not around, we are collecting all our stuff in this one software company that albeit is good right now, in 20 years, may be awful like they were when they started\n\nI never thought of it, but you're completely right. It's a \"benevolent dictator\" thing. Sure, the guy's good now, but is he going to be good until the end? And if he is, is his next in line going to be good?\n\nI'm going to get absolutely obliterated for this take, but this is exactly why companies *attempting* to compete with Steam is ultimately a good thing. Having your PC game library splintered across multiple platfroms *is* annoying, but if gamers had their way and every PC game was *only* on Steam it'd be paving the way for Valve to be able to really fuck people over if/when the company decides to exploit their monopolistic status.\n\nIt's why posts like this and people that circlejerk over Lord Gaben are idiotic. You're cheering on a single company's monopoly over all PC gaming. It's good now, but think how that can be abused. Gabe Newell won't be around forever.\n\nBlizzard never came back though? Activision sure, but Blizzard was never on Steam prior to Overwatch 2.\n\nGoG (Good Old Games for those unaware) is the only other storefront I use. They put in a lot of work to make otherwise unplayable games playable again. That said, they really don’t compete too much with steam, GoGs main thing is old games (go figure), and in that regard they are better than steam. \n\nSteam rules tho\n\nBlizzard never \"left\" steam, because they were never on Steam to begin with? And in regards to the few games they have since put on steam, I don't think not being on steam had anything to do with the negative reception surrounding them. Had they not dropped the ball with Overwatch 2 and Diablo 4's launch both of those games would probably be doing just fine being only on the battle.net launcher.\n\nI only play Hearthstone and its all through Battle.net. What does Blizzard sell on steam?\n\nIt's mindblowing how as gamers we spend most of our time sucking the metaphorical dick of big corpos in one direction or another lol\n\nOnly the corpos that the “gaming community” deems acceptable though. It’s funny going back to forums to see the reactions of people when Steam first came out, and them realizing it was required to play Half-Life 2.\n\nOr how “consumer friendly” Steam was or is. Denying that the consumer friendly policies they have is because of lawsuits, or their game archive is as big as it is only because indie developers were being denied by Steam. And said indie devs openly criticized Steam for their exclusionary practices.\n\nBrand loyalty.\n\nShit man TF2 players would to anything to get that hat for free\n\nBattlenet existed 5 years before Steam, and continues to be a decent launcher. Also starting Blizzard games doesn't require you to open the launcher.\n\nI like steam as a platform but one of the main draws of PC gaming was that you were locked to one platform but over the past ten years or so I've noticed here mentality that steam is the only platform that should exist which seems the polar opposite of what makes PC gaming so great."

    "all_comment_text": "the official game of “there’s no internet connection”\n\nlol that along with minesweeper\n\nPurble place, Spider Solitary, Mahjong, Varmintz deluxe, Bookworm adventure, Tennis titans, Snail mail\n\nDon't forget about bejeweled\n\nThis was like 98 though, bejeweled is like 10 years later.  Almost feel like it's past the category of what space pinball was.\n\nBejeweled came out in 2001\n\nSo yeah, literally a thousand years later, you go from 1000s to 2000s.\n\nMSN Gaming Zone!\n\nChess Titans as well\n\nOh yeah, that too. I’ve never won yet\n\nNeither have I, mostly because I suck at it\n\nChips Challenge (Definitely needs a sequel)\n\nRodent's Revenge!\n\nI don't think I've ever played a game so much that I truly did not know what the fuck was going on. To this day, I have no clue what the rules are.\n\nI only recently figured it out. The numbers tell you how many squares adjacent to them have a bomb. Your first click never hits a bomb, any after that hitting a bomb is game over. Point is to deduce based on the numbers which squares have a bomb without clicking on it, and place a flag there.\n\nSo you're telling me I wasted hours of my life trying to get a bomb on the first click?\n\nAnd it almost always comes down to a 50/50 that you lose 90% of the time. It was so frustrating 😅\n\nThere are versions that are without luck - always solvable by deduction:\n\nhttps://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/js/mines.html\n\nMind boggling to me that the original version of a logic game can end in a situation where you can no longer use logic and simply have to guess.\n\nNice! Thanks for sharing!\n\nThe original darkest dungeon.\n\nI think I figured that out a few years ago but I was just as fascinated why some of these games were included with particular versions of windows. Apparently they're ways to teach the 'new' methods of interaction with a game, minesweeper helping folks get used to the various button features of the mouse.\n\nMinesweeper is still a good one when you’re in a Teams meeting that you really shouldn’t have been invited to. \n\nAnd the Dino jump browser game. Back when I worked in a call center, we lost internet and we spent about an hour trying to get a high score on that lol\n\nPlaying a few games of minesweeper, listening to music, while high is a good way to spend time, even with internet.\n\nMinesweeper was the tits\n\nOfficial game of having dial up.\n\nIf you knew about emulation at the time, you were spoiled for life if you had dial-up. You were only waiting for 5-10 minutes per game from the 16-bit era for example.\n\nOfficial game of having dial up.\n\nHahahha that’s gold ! That and solitaire which oddly enough really doesn’t like to be played without internet anymore haha\n\nIt's so bad you need internet for solitaire\n\nGotta show those ads bro.\n\nI got really really good at Freecell while connecting to the internet with my 56k modem.\n\nI'll ride this top comment and say that there is an android port of it on GitHub.\n\nEdit: It also has an online leaderboard. [Here is a link](https://github.com/fexed/Pinball-on-Android/releases)\n\nOr “demo laptop at Best Buy”\n\n[deleted]\n\nMore like the maze.\n\nGood thing Ubi didnt publish it back then...\n\n[removed]\n\nLmao I still play it on my steam deck. It’s free on the discover store. Super fun to bust it out when I have 2 minutes to play\n\n2 minutes?! Nah bro, you play this game to level up and make that entire circle glow!\n\nBlack hole activated.\n\nThere is an Apple app but it’s kinda bad.\n\nHa, same here. The movement I saw it in their when I was first setting mine up I had to download it\n\nYou and OP are heroes today.\n\nReal pinball has also gotten quite popular in recent years, with more new machines being produced than ever before and new clubs and locations springing up all over. Many machines are kept clean and well working by passionate technicians. There's tons to learn regarding ball control, flipper tricks, modes, scoring, machine eras, and nudging skill. If nudging the machine sounds sacrilege, don't worry, operators expect and encourage you to move the machine to help save balls. Learning how much you can push the tilt bob is part of the game and you are not going to break it. At most locations, beer is a staple and cup holders are attached to each machine. Ages trend 20-30's, but there's plenty of younger and older players, with some of the best competitors 50+ and some under 18! There's even women's leagues that call their regional chapters Belle's and Chimes. Pinball is for everyone and anyone, so if you're ever interested in a new gaming hobby, find a club or location near you, meet people, and dive in: https://pinballmap.com/\n\nAlso, here's some great videos to get an idea of how deep advanced play can be.\n\nNudging Skills: https://youtu.be/e-xnw8XtpgU?t=2m57s \n\nSlap Saves: https://youtu.be/cMD60ZA7xH8?t=7s\n\nDrop Catching: https://youtu.be/FJawIN0P1zE?t=7s\n\nTournament Play Example: https://youtu.be/m8vNcMKK6nU?t=1h58m15s\n\nJust chiming in on this because it is very dear to me. Pinball in general, and competitive pinball are a ton of fun. My wife and I have been doing it competitively for 6 years, have met a ton of amazing people and played so many awesome games. The companies making machines right now are all doing a lot of cool things, and there are new machines coming out all the time.  \nCheck out [Pinball Map](https://pinballmap.com/) for machine locations.   \nCheck out the [IFPA](https://www.ifpapinball.com/) if you are interested in competitive pinball.\n\nWth did not expect to get a full brochure on pinball today. I love it.\n\nI started playing on 70s era analog Williams (?) and Gottlieb machines and the last machine I really enjoyed was Addams Family before I didn't really have anywhere to go play anymore. I must have spent a ton of quarters on Addams Family, it's my GOAT for pinball.\n\nIf I had money I'd have an Addams Family pinball machine in my house but they're ridiculously expensive even now.\n\nI'm glad to see pinball is alive and well!\n\nLove the new sterns and all the old ones at the places around my area. Pinball is addictive.\n\nI go to MAGfest wh8ch has a solid pinball collection and I went to a panel and learning about how to use nudging was so cool and unexpected.\n\nThanks for showing me pinballmap, that’s sick \n\nIt really was ! In school tournaments were the best ! Hahah\n\nThat brought back memories! We did tournaments in school to see who could get the highest score! Good times!\n\nI still love that they put the option to tilt in the game, and that you can lock it up by spamming it. Fantastic.\n\ncan't believe we only played the demo too. there were more levels!\n\nSpent hours playing this and Hover! on the family computer.\n\n&gt; Hover\n\nHoly fucking shit.  I have core memories of this game and have never been able to describe it or remember the name.  Just seeing it typed out it immediately all came flooding back, that's crazy lol.\n\nOn top of that, a long time ago in the days of the early internet I used to play a game pretty heavily called Wulfram II.  It was a team based hover tank game that was *heavily* inspired from Hover.  You just unlocked so many memories I forgot I had lol\n\nI love that feeling.\n\nI used to spend hours playing an Afterdark screensaver that used to be on Mac platforms called Lunatic Fringe.  It was a space shooter.  As a screensaver.  I used to put the mouse behind the computer to play because as soon as the mouse moved, the screensaver would end and you'd lose all your progress.  It never went beyond OS9, although there's a recreation of it on [Github] (https://github.com/jackinloadup/lunatic-fringe?tab=readme-ov-file) that works in a browser.\n\nYooooooo Hover! Those sound effects are forever burned into my brain.\n\n(As are the Space Cadet Pinball ones)\n\nAnother classic was Chip's Challenge! [Which is apparently free on Steam now.](https://store.steampowered.com/app/346850/Chips_Challenge_1/)\n\nSki Free!\n\nJezzball\n\nAdded to my library, thank you for this\n\nBRO THANK YOU FOR THIS\n\nI learned my arrow key mechanics from this game specifically, which obviously supported my WASD skills and made me the man I am today\n\nThank you. \n\nI loved chips challenge!!!\n\nDuuuuuuuuude. You just threw me BACK. \n\nIs there some kinda list of these early 90s pc hits? I need to peruse it with images like this so I can remember.\n\nHover fucking ruled. That Windows 95 CD was amazing. Did you play Hellbender? And also 3D Movie Maker\n\nYeahhh Windows 95 was ahead of its time.  What about Descent? \n\nI also had some submarine captain simulator game with real life cutscenes. If anyone knows what game that was, I've never been able to find it.\n\nOoo, I didn't know about Descent! I'll have to check it out.\n\ncheck out forsaken if you want another banger.\n\nYou're the first person I've ever seen mention Forsaken. I was starting to think I had made it all up in my head, cover girl and all.\n\nHey, got any more of them memories I forgot I had?\n\nSameeeeee and omg hover what a gem too ! Ahhhh the good old days\n\nThank fuck I'm not the only one who remembers hove. I loved that game!\n\nThis was part of a collection called full tilt pinball. There was a pirate table and castle table too. The sequel was even better, with a super hero table where you’d battle bosses, a UFO table, and a mad scientist table. Awesome games!\n\nI wish i had played the others ! That sounds awesome\n\nMost people had no idea this was a demo  and that there were other tables\n\nit's the fault of the dev/microsoft. the only hint was a little maxis logo in the bottom.\n\n[removed]\n\nVirusTotal scan of the .ZIP file\nSecurity vendors' analysis\nGoogle\nDetected\nIkarus\nTrojan.Win32.Pyinstaller\n\nPyinstallers result in quite a bit of false positives but yeah might wanna use a vm for that one just in case.\n\nJust gonna come back to this later so I can see if anyone's like \"Yeah, that's a false positive, they do that for just about everything now\" so I can believe them at face value.\n\nYeah, that's a false positive, they do that for just about everything now\n\nThanks for lookin out, scwt.\n\nEDIT: h̵̨̧̢̛̛̻̘̲͉̥͓͙͉͈̼̼͚̤͎͓͍̜̻̱̫̩͇͎͔̥̳̬̘̪̠͉̥͕͎̲̆̏͌̌͗͆̒̑̑̔̂̓̃͗̄́̓̆̿̄̂͂̊̌̈͋̎̐̏̿̉̀͑̔͌͘͜͝ȩ̵̧̨̧̟̜̺̙͍̻̦̤̱͉̬̝͚̣̗̤͎͎̗̯̪̘̦̝̗̬̙̟̮̺̥̬̻͙̗̙̥͉̔̈̈́̃ͅļ̵̛̛̦͔͇̼͔̫͉̻̝̘̝̣̻̹̺̺̪͍̇̈͛͛͋͊̒́̂̂͂̇̑̆̂́̿͛̓̍̑̅̄̊̎̃͐̑̅̊̒̓͊̈́̋͗̄̀̀̚̚͘͘͘͘͠͠p̴̨̨̨̨̨̡̧̡̨̢̨̧̛̭̜͈̞̖̗̖̱̮͇̼̠͍͕̣̙̼̩̠͖͚̳̬̖̹̝͓̖̗͈̣̺̮̦̱̺̜̩̼͍̩͈̘͇̜͗̑̒̿͊͑̓̑̑̍̂̽̂̿͐̽́͊͒͛͋̋̂̄̿̐͑͆̔̉̌̌́̀͒͗̈̀̑́̊̿͑̽̔̓͋̂̒̆̇̓͆͂͒̇̃͗͘̚̕͘̚͘͝͠\n\ninternet at your own risk folks. Thanks for the heads up.\n\nMy internet person! Thanks!\n\nOh sweet! originally, I got an error saying my comment didn't post! :D\n\nPost and link are all good.\n\nthere was one with a gator i think\n\nDamn! Didn't know there were sequels!\n\nDragon's Keep was my favorite! Kicking the ball right into the dragon's mouth was so satisfying.\n\nHere is also the obligatory **Super User** (cheat code) for 3D Pinball Space Cadet:\n\nType &gt;!hidden test!&lt; (click to reveal the code) with the empty space included before launching the first ball. You can then control the ball with the mouse.\n\nSource: This comes from one of the original programmers that worked on porting the game, **Dave Plummer** (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThxdvEajK8g&amp;t=11m30s)\n\nThank you for sharing this, OP, and for the reminder\n\nI discovered this fact when I was about 10 and for a day at school I was the most popular child ever, people would come up to me and watch in awe as I put in the cheat and moved the ball around, racking up points with effortless glee. We had never really considered the fact that such a cheat could ever exist. It was a glorious day.\n\nThat's awesome! Those are special kind of experiences and also makes you realize the attention to detail (and hidden secrets) some developers put in their games\n\nHow did you discover it?\n\nCan't remember, it was almost 30 years ago.  Probably my dad told me, he used to get a bunch of PC magazines, feels like the sort of Fun Fact they would publish in between all the articles about Adobe Photoshop 3.0\n\nProbably Gamefaqs. That’s where all the cheats came from in the 90s and 00s.\n\nThanks for that. I might just do it just because I’m curious about all of the other missions I never got to in the game.\n\n&gt; Dave Plummer\n\nHis videos are really well done. I first started watching his videos after I found the one he did on Task manager.\n\nYes indeed. Interesting to watch and informative. He also makes interviews with other developers from time to time\n\nBRO. Like 20 years too late!!!\n\n❤️\n\nI can hear this picture lol!\n\nbeww, beww, beww, beww, bewbewbewbewbew p-shooo!\n\nYou forgot the weirdly loud \"NERWYERWEYRWEYR\"\n\nLol basically! that's a pretty solid onomatopoeic rendition, ngl.\n\nCore memory unlocked.\n\nOnce I learned how to actually play instead of “just hitting the ball” I became a pro.\n\nAgreed ! Nothing will beat getting 2 of the extra points ramps in a row ! When i was a kid i thought hitting the ramp meant you won the game 😂\n\nI don't know if it's the ramp but I'd always try to hit my ball in the thing that loops back around because it sends the ball back to your bumper. If you time the bump right you can hit it back up in there repeatedly. Was how I scored in the millions\n\nSame. Felt like it was my first ever qte test in video games lol.\n\nI feel old\n\nWe are old (,:\n\nThere is a version out with modern physics. I play it all the time on my virtual cab.  \nhttps://www.vpforums.org/index.php?app=downloads&amp;module=display&amp;section=screenshot&amp;record=114051&amp;id=16091&amp;full=1\n\nhttps://www.vpforums.org/index.php?app=downloads&amp;showfile=16091\n\nJP's Visual Pinball tables are so good!\n\nSame here! First table I loaded onto my cabinet after I made it\n\nIs this playable on a computer? How do I play it? It looks awesome!\n\nYep, you'll need to install VPX and runt he game in desktop mode. I used to play a ton of tables that way. Easiest way to install everything required is using something called Baller Installer, it takes care of everything you'll need as VPX is not a straightforward way to play visual pinball.\n\nI love finding people who share my semi obscure hobbies\n\nOn the Steam Deck, Space Cadet Pinball is the highest rated game on the application store\n\nThis is what I did when mom said I couldn't use the internet because she was expecting a phone call\n\nThis game is how I learned the word “Ensign”. Never got past that rank either\n\nIn case you don't know, here is the android port of the game:\n\nhttps://github.com/fexed/Pinball-on-Android/releases\n\nDope. Thanks.\n\n[removed]\n\nYes, you can activate them in the options menu.\n\nWas losing hope as I kept scrolling, thank you!\n\nMy best was around 21 million and then grandma made me turn it off and go to bed. I was furious\n\nI think my best was similar to that too, when I was like 9, I was really good at just looping the left mission starter thingy that gives you 25000 over and over again.\n\nI've played it a couple times in recent years after finding a way to get it on modern computers, but I don't think I managed to get to career stage 2 even, my best is under 4 millions. Those side drops have always been screwing me over.\n\n\"The trick is to just spam it, right?\" - Joel Vinesauce\n\nYou know, there *is* an app of that— even if it costs three dollars, and isn’t the greatest app of all time. It’s worth it for the nostalgia alone.\n\nAndroid one is free, and it's in portrait mode.\n\nandroid port of the original Space Cadet Pinball\n\nhttps://github.com/fexed/Pinball-on-Android\n\nShoot I’d pay 3 $ that’s a steal for how much nostalgia I’d receive haha\n\nHere you go— https://apps.apple.com/us/app/3d-pinball-space-cadet/id6455495086 \n\nIt’s a disturbingly unknown app, for what it is.\n\nyou have to PAY for it?!!!! that's hilarious given it was free and it's so old\n\nIf i could pin this i would people need to know they can buy it hahah\n\nTheres a website you can play it for free. SOmeone made a post about this just a week or two ago and linked it, id have to check but its out there.\n\nFun trivia-- People have theorized how to make this machine IRL, but because of how bulky and tall a pop bumper is under the playfield, it's not easy to make one on an upper level.\n\nDaaaamn my childhood right there\n\nIs there someplace I can play this since it's no longer packaged with windows?\n\nIn case you forget to loop back around, a bunch of links have been posted in the past couple hours.\n\nI loved this so much! We had it on our school computers\n\nSameeee ! We used to have Tournaments to see who could get the highest score aka hit the ball the most times haha\n\nI still have this installed on my work computer. I play it in Zoom meetings every now and then. \n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/LHSd1SD.png\n\nAn artist I work with used a complete windows buildout for his website.\n\nYou can go play pinball and minesweeper and all the stuff live on it if you’d like. His music can be found in the Winamp. I rock the stone cold Steve Austin Skin.\n\n\nhttps://imofficiallyjack.com/\n\nLoved this game. EXE is on archive.org:  \n[Full Tilt! Pinball Collection (Windows) : amamic1803 : Free Download, Borrow, and Streaming : Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/full-tilt-pinball-collection-windows)\n\nThis game was my first contact with computers when I was a child, on a Toshiba as thick as a brick! Nowadays I work in IT :) good memories\n\nFinding out this was just a demo as an adult blew my mind.\n\na single picture that can bring up so much emotional nostalgia.\n\nAll the sounds instantly came back \n\nI can hear the picture no joke\n\nGood ol' days? I usually played this because I was bored out of my mind and had nothing better to do. It wasn't a *good* game, it was a *free* game that came with Windows.\n\nMy man spittin facts. I feel sorry for these people. Epic pinball shareware is where it's at!\n\nhttps://alula.github.io/SpaceCadetPinball/ There's also Linux native version available.\n\nThere's a full-on series of builds for all contemporary systems, based on decompiling the original EXE. Including a modern Windows build that has scaling and lets you go full-screen.\n\nhttps://github.com/k4zmu2a/SpaceCadetPinball\n\nHaha that's my reddit profile banner\n\nHahaha that’s awesome !\n\nWe didn't all spam any key??\n\nI used to play pinball on the 8bit video game using remote, with relatives. It was pretty fun. \n\nI played on computer too but that was alone\n\nI member!\n\nThe old shit Is good\n\n*^(peeew)* woop!\n\nBRRRRing ding ding do ween do ween wo ween\n\nI remember when, I used to go to my uncle's office just to play this.\n\nNeeds a remake with a battle pass and MTX\n\nMan I used to play this all the time on PCs, I wish they kept it as a standard. Played it a lot on high school and college computers.\n\nHours wasted on that game. Ill age myself with skifree..\n\nI was just playing this the other day. If you are on linux you can get it via flatpak.\n\nthe good ol' days. i used to play this geme after long and intense tactical ops sessions to chill and relax.\n\nand android pinball 😉\n\nThis came pre-loaded on WinXP right? I can't remember which one of my computers had this on it.\n\nPinball Fantasies on Amiga is the way, i used to play with it a lot.\n\nGod I would kill to be able to play this again. Talk about a nostalgia bomb\n\nLoved this game. EXE is on archive.org:  \n[Full Tilt! Pinball Collection (Windows) : amamic1803 : Free Download, Borrow, and Streaming : Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/full-tilt-pinball-collection-windows)\n\nEveryone remembers this one, but who remembers [Crystal Caliburn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zbqaZ2Or6c)?\n\nNever forget that this is just a DEMO!\n\nThe full version is called \"Full Tilt! Pinball\" and comes with 2 more whole tables. Dragon's Keep and Skullduggery, both awesome Pinball tables.\n\nPinball FX on steam is great. Visual Pinball X is great as well and has a realistic recreation of this table, amongst thousands of others.\n\nI have had exactly one game on my Android phone for many years: \n\nVector Pinball. \n\nIt's available on F-Droid or directly at: https://github.com/dozingcat/Vector-Pinball\n\nI can still hear the sound effects\n\nOne of the earliest games I ever played. That, Dino Island, and Oregon Trail (I have flashbacks at the mention of river crossings)\n\nBest game in Windows XP\n\nStill playable [https://holajuegos.com/game/3d-pinball-for-windows-space-cadet](https://holajuegos.com/game/3d-pinball-for-windows-space-cadet)\n\nWow. The memba berries are strong with this one.\n\nHow do I play this in 2024?\n\nThis game and \"like humans do\" by David Byrne on windows media player.\n\nCan literally hear this photo\n\nPictures you can hear\n\nReal pinball is better\n\nParticularly the older, mostly mechanical machines with lots of wiring; you just can't surpass the sights and sounds of those old machines.\n\nBTW, if anyone is interested in how those work then Technology Connections has some brilliantly detailed videos on YouTube, here's the playlist:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue-1JoJQaEg&amp;list=PLv0jwu7G_DFVAUoqtVxFVIu2oZc2GGyDf\n\nThere's also an extra video on his Technology Connextras channel:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3Y4d2aHnNE\n\nWow it’s been a minute\n\nThe game sound and effects are a OST on its own\n\nBest pinball implementation ever :P"

    "all_comment_text": "\"oh my god! The speculative value of a product from 40 years ago! It's shriveling before the prospect of being preserved as an appreciated art form and enjoyed by people across generations instead of sitting in a crypt behind a subscription! Oh noooooo\"\n\n40 years? Ha! For works like books it's until the death of the author + 70 years. Let's call it 75 years for simplicity: the original Mario was released in 1983, it will be free of copyright in 2058.\n\nConsidering how much the digital landscape has changed from 1983 until today, I can only imagine how prehistoric that version of Mario must look to people in 2058.\n\nMiyamoto isn't even dead yet, so when he dies + 70 years. So more like 2100 or more.\n\nCopyright used to last for 28 years with the possibility of a 14 year extension (fairly reasonable numbers). Starting in the 1900s, the public domain has been gradually stolen out from under us by lawmakers and the wealthy assholes and corporations who pay them, and duration will probably be extended again.\n\nPeople, don’t forget what was stolen from you. Mario Bros (and countless other works) should be in the public domain by now. As established and historical parts of our culture they should belong to you, to all of us, but they were taken thanks to a handful of crooks with political power.\n\n&gt; and duration will probably be extended again\n\nMaybe, but Disney had such a chokehold on copyright legislation that it was conventional wisdom (to the point I was taught it as fact in college) that nothing newer than Steamboat Willie would ever enter public domain because Disney would never allow Steamboat Willie to enter the public domain. But now it has, so bets are off.\n\nHave they? They let the copyright lapse into public domain, but they also started actively using it in their trade dress years prior to that so it is still held under trademark.\n\nSteamboat Willie is “free-ish” at best, it is far from free. They won’t nail you on copyright infringement, but trademark infringement instead.\n\n&gt; they also started actively using it in their trade dress years prior to that so it is still held under trademark.\n\nI actually don't have a problem with this, tbh. Trademark law is much more nuanced and reasonable than the cold, unbending copyright law. It's fair in my opinion to not be able to use Steamboat Willie to try and copycat Disney. Public Domain is meant to allow people free access to information and works that no longer hold commercial value, and having something protected by trademark but not copyright fulfills that value.\n\nI think it's more than just access. It acknowledges that certain works become part of our culture and identity and allow us to iterate and create new works based on it. \n\nLike how many vampire movies and works are there? Now imagine the original nosferatu was like steamboat Willie, and the estate of Bram Stoker would sue everyone and anyone making anything that resembles a vampire character... \n\nWe don't realize the impact of this eternal ownership because it's rather \"new\"... But in the coming decades and centuries, unless something changes, it's going to hugely affect our culture globally. \n\nWe are a storytelling species... It's fundamental to how we process, how we remember, learn, and how we develop. \n\nI quite seriously think that being able to control cultural IP beyond a certain reasonable length of time, is a crime against humanity. We just don't get it yet.\n\nSure, and I don't disagree with you. But that's where Trademark law is much better. Because Trademark acknowledges specific uses. If Steamboat Willie is Disney's trademark, you can't use Steamboat Willie to advertise your new theme park. But you can write a story about a mouse on a boat.\n\nFor corporate works, like most video games, the duration of copyright is 95 years.\n\nPeople in 2058 will be playing a full neuro-immersion version of Mario where when you kiss Princess Peach you can actually feel her lips on yours.\n\nHow much more poignant the despair when you have dodged lava balls and monsters only realize she's actually in another castle\n\nToad gives better gawk gawk anyway.\n\n\"I'm the best!\"\n\nWhat a terrible day to have eyes\n\nRule34 in 2058 is going to be very... Interesting.\n\nIt should be immediately after the product ceases to be produced. If you aren't making it and selling it, it's fair game.  \n  \nI feel like I need to clarify that it also needs to be sold for a reasonable price. A game only being available in one of those mini arcade cabinets for several hundred dollars doesn't count.\n\n\n&gt;It should be immediately after the product ceases to be produced. If you aren't making it and selling it, it's fair game.  \n  \nHow does that work with things like online stores or Nintendo's version of the \"Disney Vault\" by releasing only select times. Or do we consider releasing a new game in a series continued IP? So Mario Wonder would keep Mario under protections? \n\nI fully believe we need to preserve games and I fully believe copyright has gotten out of control. But when compared to things like Spiderman or Mickey Mouse, they've been under control of a company and with a certain narrative. Allowing that to be public domain would devalue the IP that's still active.\n\nI think something like if you can't aquire it retail (not resale), digital or physical, in the last 5 years than it enters \"public domain\". So companies can still do re-releases and such to pump numbers but it limits them to a maximum cycle so they can't make it unattainable. They can even just let it be available for digital purchase forever so they don't have to deal with inventory.\n\nAlso it only allows making copies of the media. So it just makes pirating dead media legal, the existing system stays for making new media using the characters\n\nI would also say that any media that gets killed for tax purposes (looking at you Warner/Discovery) gets released in it's current state just like any other dead media under my proposal (the only difference is no 5 year waiting period)\n\n&gt; I would also say that any media that gets killed for tax purposes (looking at you Warner/Discovery) gets released in it's current state just like any other dead media under my proposal (the only difference is no 5 year waiting period)\n\nThat this isn't the default reveals the genuinely corrupt nature of the whole copyright system.  There are other tells and bigger stories related to it, but that you can take money out of public hands in the form of a tax break on media you deliberately will never let the public see is outright crooked.  If the Wile E. Coyote movie was leaked then treating any sharing of it as a breach of copyright cannot be a good faith argument, by definition.\n\nPeople might play old games for fun!   Say it ain't so!!!\n\nBuy our re-re-remaster instead, or subscribe for a lifetime in order to play.\n\n&gt;or subscribe for a lifetime in order to play\n\nAnd be shit out of luck when we decide to shut down this game.\n\nCheck out the [Stop Killing Games ](https://www.stopkillinggames.com/)initiative, it was made to fight against that shit.\n\nCan I still sign this even if not in eu?\n\nSign the EU petition. Please.\n\nTechnically not a \"petition\" but an \"initiative\" meaning if the goal is met then the EU is obligated to take action.\n\nTo consider action*\n\nThat's not even the problem most people have. The problem is a lot of older games aren't being remastered or even just ported, they aren't officially available anymore.\n\nBut you see, they *could* be. They *could* be ported and make 42 trillion dollars, so losing that means the company basically had 42 trillion stolen from them.\n\nIt sounds like their bigger concern, at least based purely on the headline, is that you'd play the older games instead of the new AAAAAAA games they're producing and selling for $85 each plus $25/DLC or whatever pricing model they want to use. They'd rather sell that than a $30 old game, and if the old game is available for free elsewhere, they get to do neither, so they'd rather shelf it for eternity.\n\nAnd they're correct, based on the trend of most AAA games coming out lately being hot piles of garbage, bar a few diamonds in the rough. I would rather pay $30 for a remake of Final Fantasy 9 than I would play whatever multiplayer GAAS schlock some suits in a high-rise boardroom decided gamers would love and sell for $70.\n\nHell, even Nintendo is guilty of this, as other people have stated, even though their in-house games are generally better than most. I would buy them in a heartbeat if Nintendo released the DS and 3DS generation of Pokemon games on the Switch.\n\nI just happily paid *another* hundred bucks for *another* Final Fantasy 1-6 collection. Even though I have these games on every system I've ever owned. I'll buy and play every remaster.\n\nAnd if they couldn’t be ported then fuck you. Only shareholders get a say in what is allowed to exist. If it isn’t profitable, nobody gets it.\n\nOr they could be ported but the game uses a lot of old music licenses that expired so it would be too expensive to make WHILE also being an insanely profitable venture with guaranteed sales on at least the original market.\n\nmake it make sense...\n\n&gt;make it make sense...\n\nThe top executives who make these decisions don't play video games, they only look at stats and cash\n\nIt's kinda like back in the day before legal music streaming/downloading was really a thing (circa 2000 or so?)...The RIAA claimed that they had lost some obscene amount of money because of people obtaining music via ..er, \"sailing the high seas.\" Their claim rested on the rather preposterous assumption that *every single illegally-downloaded track* would have otherwise been a sale at full retail price.   \n  \nIIRC, the grand total number that they came up with was literally greater than the sum total of *all currency that had ever existed* on this planet throughout all of recorded history. Many laughs were had.\n\nA remaster is still not the original, which is awful for historical preservation. And even worse, they tend to modify things in remasters.\n\nThat’s a very excellent point.\n\nJust look at the gta definitive edition, worse in nearly every way and Rockstar originally delisted the original versions from Steam...\n\nA lot of old games cannot even be re-released because the ownership situation is a clusterfuck with the properties from various rights holders tied up in them and often an unclear ownership situation.\n\nThe sad fate of *No one Lives Forever*\n\nIt’s really sad, I’m constantly recommending the game to people but there’s no way to play the game legally\n\n/No one plays forever/\n\nAnd the Deadpool game\n\nSad Godfather 1&amp;2 noises :(\n\nLook the copyright system for any form of media has to be overhauled majorly. It constantly gets in the way of progress. Hell look at Spec Ops: The Line a game got literally from public access all because of licensed music. Even if it were re-released a part of that game would be gone which is the music. Not every music group or company whatever wants to rerelease their product. Even worse, when they do they put up a big fit and ask for too much money. Then, we lose old features in remasters because the price couldn’t be paid. I’m sure there are some people who work out reasonable deals, but not everyone.\n\n\\*lifetime in this context meaning until we turn the servers off.\n\nget fucked loser!\n\nBut that of course means lifetime of the server, you should know that /s\n\nI mean the main argument FOR piracy of older games is that if the publisher/devs don’t plan to make them accessible or remake/remaster them, which also makes them more accessible, then its perfectly within reason for the consumers to do it ourselves. Rerealsing the game is a GOOD thing, fuck the idea of the subscription though.\n\nThing is, I'd even do that for the Pokémon games but they still refuse to release them on the Switch lol makes no sense\n\nReally mindboggling that they havent. I really want to play Heartgold and Platiunum for example, but the second hand market is insane. Either you have to shell out 100€ or more, or deal with scammers who try the old \"just the box\" or fake cartridges. So i dont even bother.\n\nIts really no surprise the emulation scene is as big as it is, as Gabe newell said \"Piracy is a service problem\" or something along those lines.\n\nYeah, I completely missed out on the DS generation because I went for the PSP back then and there's no way I'm getting a DS now with my Switch backlog and pay scalper prices for all these games lol\n\nI can technically still play the GB games since the systems still work but if there's the possibility to play all these classics on the Switch and on TV without any hassle whatsoever, I don't understand why they never bothered to make it happen\n\nYou can find jailbroken DS units with entire catalogs for quite cheap.\n\nHow dare these assholes have fun!!!!! Don't they know games are for profit only?!?!?!?! Now please buy the 50th port of our game for ~~$60~~ $70!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nGod forbid\n\nI read books for fun.\n\nWelp,  if this guy is reading for recreation, it's time to do away with the library of congress.\n\nThanks, u/stenmarkv :[\n\nStraight to jail!\n\nWe have a special jail for retro-gamers. No trial, no nothing.\n\n\"People play games that don't make them pay endlessly to enjoy them.\" ...is what they are concerned about.\n\nI'm waiting for subscription based basketballs.  Unless you pay the monthly sub, they will deflate.  Big ball will petition congress to make it illegal to tamper with those mechanisms (for safety)\n\nI recently purchased a really high-quality mock OG Xbox controller so I can go back and play the classics. Was way more excited for the controller to come in the mail than I was for any recent releases.\n\n“Let’s get rid of any attempt at art preservation.  If we preserve art, people might look at it and get something out of the experience.”\n\nUm… yeah, that’s why you’d preserve it.\n\nJoe, please!\n\n\"Woukd be used for recreational\"...isn't.. isn't that the point of games?\n\nYes, but the reason the Video Game History Foundation and the Software Preservation Network want to archive the copyrighted games is for preservation and research purposes, which is an exception to copyright. But they could not adequately demonstrate that the archived works wouldn't also be used recreationally, which is not an exception to copyright.\n\nFor fuck's sake you can't prove I won't use anything *sexually*. If having another possible use excludes shit from preservation then nothing can be preserved. The point of preserving culture would include enjoying that culture.\n\nAs a preservationist I both support this argument and ಠ_ಠ \n\n[deleted]\n\nGood to know! I thought I was emulating retro games to get bored…\n\nOh God I hope they never find out I've been enjoying archival video, photos, and text this whole time\n\nI may need to go into hiding, *I've enjoyed too much*\n\n\"Enjoyment is a societal cancer destroying healthy profitd.\" - some suit, somewhere, probably!\n\nIn other news, corporations are greedy.\n\nIn other other news, for some reason the US lets those greedy corps decide the course of action for everyone in the country! Yaay... democracy..?\n\nmore like Yaay legal corruption.\n\nIt's called plutocracy, in case you wanted a precise descriptor.\n\nI prefer the term \"Corporatocracy,\" as I don't like to feed into the illusion that corporations have rights or should be treated as people.\n\nYeah plutocracy just gives Pluto a bad name.\n\nSome aspects of corporate personhood are good. For instance, corporate personhood allows corporations to be sued, taxed, fined, etc. It's been that way since before America. The bullshit comes when corporations are only given the benefits of personhood, but none of the detriments. For instance, if corporations are afforded the same constitutional protections as people, the people should be allowed to jail corporations for breaking the law.\n\nYeah i know. Just wanted to point out its a terrible, undemocratic system.\n\nWhat are you talking about? It's going great! Right guys?.... Right? Don't you feel that trickle? I've been trickled on for decades and I think I'm starting to like it 😳\n\nworld*\n\n\nThe US very much so insists on exporting it's insane IP laws, bullying other nations into compliance, and acting like the entire world wide web is under American jurisdiction.\n\n\"if they're playing old games, they wont play our new games they can't actually own!\"\n\nyeah, thats the point.\n\nHaving a bunch of old games I haven't played yet, has yet to stop me buying more.\n\nUr far from the only one, but publishers are so greedy they're going after that 5% of ppl who regularly play old games.\n\nI always play old games over and over again, it's why I have them.\n\nWhat do you mean?   I bought Yar's revenge back in 1988 and havent bought a game cince.   It's the pinnacle of game play with the most realistic graphics ever...  I hold it in high esteem right next to my Atari ET game cart as what perfection looks like.\n\nYou're obviously doing it wrong. You gotta be like me who plays every game he buys once then immediately sets it on fire the minute a new AAA game comes out.  \n\n\n Why enjoy the gifts of the past when you can be miserable with nothing today?\n\n\nEdit: /s \n\nYou are the Qotile's strongest soldier.\n\nwere talking about companies that argue that every pirated copy is a missed sale on their end, even tho it never was.\n\nIn other news, artists are absolutely terrified art would be used for artistic purposes. Musicians everywhere tremble at the idea of people listening to their music. God forbid you tell a director you liked their movie. \n\nBelieve it or not, straight to jail.\n\nWe preserve old art for people to enjoy it. We preserve old movies for people to be able to still watch them. We preserve old music so people can still listen to it.\n\nWhy the fuck can’t we preserve old video games so people can still play them?\n\nIf company could claim copyright of paintings, remaster and sell them again then I'm certain they'd go after those who do art restauration\n\nNext time someone complain about the cost of piracy, tell them that this is the price of not doing conservation properly\n\nBecause video game publishers have found a way to bribe the government and the government LOVES IT\n\nAnd they make that money back many times over in tax breaks and rebates. We each pay more tax than Activision, for example.\n\n&gt; restauration\n\nIs that when they turn the art into a restaurant?\n\nLmao good one I didn't noticed\n\nRead about Getty Images. Fucking assholes. Photographers have filed suits against them and all have lost. Some artists take pictures and leave them for public use or donate them to the Library of Congress for the same purpose. Getty and their subsidiaries went through and removed the Photographers credit line, replacing it with their own. They even tried to charge the artist for use of her own photos even though they had no power legally to do so!! So they use it, pay zero royalties to the owner and screw the public. And they have done this for decades.  \n\n\nEdited for clarity.  \n\n\nhttps://graphicartistsguild.org/judge-dismisses-photographers-1-billion-case-against-getty-images/   \n\n\nhttps://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-hiltzik-getty-copyright-20160729-snap-story.html\n\nWell they do reprints, but the museums arent shutting down cos of those. Its same for old games, people that want to have originals will, no matter what.\n\nYou have no idea. Ugh. Owners of old paintings trying to control reproduction rights by claiming copyright on original photography of said paintings and giving limited access to anyone with a camera is absolutely a things. Thankfully, there's been a lot of pushback and the courts are headed back in the right direction, at least on this very small part of our copyright dystopia.\n\npublishers view games as a product still rather than any form of artistry. movies can be art and entertainment. but games have yet to reach that combination in teh eyes of publishers and a large chunk, if not majority of the publics. personally, i am of the camp that videogames are art as well as entertainment- with each game leaning towards each to various degrees.\n\nIt would make sense if video games weren’t for playing, just a vehicle for money\n\nThey don't care if you actually play it. They just want you to buy it.\n\nWhat they don't understand is that a lot of gamers would ABSOLUTELY pay for a new copy of a game if it meant we could play it on the devices we own now.\n\nGive me Zelda Twilight Princess on my Switch. I don't need a remake or a remaster. I would absolutely pay $40 for the ability to play that. No? Okay, well, time to pirate it and use an emulator.\n\nWhat would be probably the best is to set some period after which the game becomes part of public domain. Just do not make it 70 years after the death of the last developer...\n\nEven better would be to make the source code available, but I guess there are instances where that simply isn't possible. It would be nice to live in a world where it is common courtesy to release the code after some 15-20 years, but we are not in that world...\n\nBecause you can't sell an AI upscaled \"remaster\" of the Mona Lisa and make ten million dollars off it.\n\nbut you can keep a cheap print in your home without being sued for it\n\nIt's not the artists/developers who are terrified, it's the business people who've actively made the industry a worse place who are terrified of preservation.\n\nArtists and developers want people to enjoy their games, business people don't give a shit if you enjoy it as long as you keep paying.\n\n&gt; it's the business people who've actively made the industry a worse place \n\nFunnily enough, it was the actor's union in the UK that pressured the BBC to wipe recordings.\n\nMore reruns = less work for actors, I guess.\n\n&gt; Musicians everywhere tremble at the idea of people listening to their music. \n\nthis was actually an issue in the days of Napster. not for every musician, but for a substantial chunk of them. \n\njust a short decade or so later, everything was on Youtube and Soundcloud. \n\nit's funny how quick the turns table.\n\nMedia executives everywhere are terrified you would be listening to old songs/enjoying old art, and not buying the new rehashed trash that they cheated out of artists.\n\nI'm doing my part to keep a bank of preserved video games.\n\nI recently bought an 8TB HDD for \"storage\" purposes\n\nMy 6TB hard drive full of preserved video games is for medicinal purposes only.\n\nYeah moves like these only encourage me to download more old roms for fear that they won’t be available in the future\n\nHear me out if you want people playing your New games, maybe just maybe make them better than the old ones ?\n\nBut that requires taking a risk and putting in effort, which will interfere with the profit margin, which won't make the line go up as much.\n\nPublishers may want to consider that you don't HAVE to spend 100 million dollars developing every new game.\n\nAnd you def dont need to spend 3x that on a ceo who doesnt do anything\n\nHow dare you say they do nothing!\n\n\nTheir job is to seek short-term gains, destroy the company from within in aid of raising the stock price, then take a golden parachute to jump out of the building they rigged to blow while the next CEO gets to deal with the incoming rubble.\n\n&gt; you don't HAVE to spend 100 million dollars marketing every new game.\n\n\nftfy\n\nOr heck, make the old games playable on the new system and sell the old games. There are many old games that you no longer can buy (not counting auctions and such). You can't go to a digital store and just buy \"emperor: battle for dune\".\n\nI lost (had stolen?) about 30 original gameboy cartridges during university.\n\n\nMy phone from 15 years ago could've handled those games, and I'd happily pay for each of them again. \n\nThere’s something really fun happening with an app called delta…\n\nAgreed, or maybe keep features that work and are popular in the next entry. This is why I dislike Pokemon Gens after 6, I realize they're going for weird gimmicks each gen to make them even more stand out rather than build on what works. I was really looking forward to more mega evolutions, instead they introduced Z-moves, then gigantamax, and then terastallization. They even got rid of mega evolutions and different battle formats like triple or rotation. Newer entries are just not worth it for me.\n\nWhat other purposes do video GAMES have?\n\nThey probably would prefer you to place them on your shelf and stare at them while the shiny new product with many microtransactions is available right NOW! The \"Don't ask questions, just consume product and get excited for next product!\" mentality\n\n&gt;is available ~~right~~ for NOW!\n\nBecause the publisher could just decide to give it The Crew treatment at any moment. It isn't your game anyway. You just paid for the license play it.\n\nOh my god you're right! That just reminded me... go to [https://www.stopkillinggames.com/](https://www.stopkillinggames.com/) lmao\n\nthe purpose of the bill is for historians and researchers to have access to old games, so for research purposes. the counterargument is that in practice it would mostly be used to just play games for free, and that that would negatively impact the industry\n\n“Essentially, this exemption would open up the possibility of a digital library where historians and researchers could ‘check out’ digital games that run through emulators. “\n\nThis was never going to hold up in court.  They are better off negotiating individual access deals or exemptions with copyright holders.\n\nCopyright needs to change tbh. This is like negotiating with a Rock wall. They do not care, it is all about profit for them. Legistlation must come and slap them on their greedy hands for it to actually work as it should.\n\nCopyright like this has centuries of inertia behind it. Games that run on specific systems that eventually get outdated and can not be technically played on something newer is a brand new concept in terms of copyright. Music and movies are newer concepts but they are still pretty much playable on whatever new format comes out because they can also be transferred extremely easily. Games can't obviously. But again centuries upon centuries of established laws on this stuff. I agree strongly with you that changes need to happen but you have to recognize the amount of history you're fighting against.\n\nAt first I scoffed at your claim that copyright law has centuries of inertia behind it, but then I looked it up and... 1709. TIL.\n\nThe ideas behind copyright and patents have existed for a long long time. Patents have existed \"officially\" since the 15th century.  Copyright has actually existed for a lot longer than you think, even, as the idea of it came about around the time of the printing press in the 15th and 16th centuries.\n\nBe me, year 45k BC, Grug, the local registrar who stamps your tax document stone with my tax rock stamp\n\nBut that was hundreds of years in which copyright terms were relatively short, providing a reasonable amount of time for the creator to make money, and then putting the work into the public domain after that. It's only within the last 50 years that copyrights have been lengthened to such ridiculous amounts of time.\n\nHonestly, it seems pretty spiteful for them not to allow it if this is for really old games. Stuff they're not selling and will never sell again. So many games just disappear because there stops being any way to access them.\n\nThey want us to be renters. The goal is a constant revenue stream flowing in.\n\nIsn’t it funny how communism propaganda was how we would own nothing if we were communists and now we’re heading towards owning nothing?\n\nNot saying communism would have been better, but I just think it’s funny.\n\nSheer projection, just like all the talk about how authoritarian and domineering it would be.   \nAs if \"freedom\" is just a matter of being subjugated by corporate power instead of government power.\n\nGod forbid\n\nI still have my Grandpa's pool table from the 1940s that has a \"nickel\" slot to play. \n\nThink of all the nickels that I should have been paying to play every game...\n\nWe cannot compete with our past selves. Back then we were trying to make good games not sell endless micro transitions.\n\nTbf plenty of old games were churned out to chase trends. Try playing most fighting games released in the first year after SF2\n\nand all the movie-licensed unplayable garbage with the 1-in-100 exception\n\n\"oh noes, what are we going to do now? we were just remastering all of our bestsellers and now ppl can just play the original?!  wtf?! now they won't ever buy the same game they already have but with slightly better graphics and costs $80 now.\"\n\nand they seriously wonder why people pirate....\n\n\"We de-listed this title.  We don't sell it anymore.  We make no profit or loss from it.  It is abandoned.\n\nAnd we're going to do everything in our power to stop you from salvaging it for future generations to marvel at.\"\n\n*Piracy is justified.*\n\nFlip the coin around, every museum technically displays and profits from stolen items. The difference is the rights holders are long dead. Some of this stuff even has a recorded origin and someone that technically inherited it, yet you can still pay your 15 bucks and see it thousands of miles away from its origin.\n\nHow's that any different really? I'm no pirate, I'm an archeologist! At that rate an arcade running emulated games for people to play without a license should be perfectly fine so long as it's a non-profit museum right? That's the ridiculousness of this entire argument against preserving games.\n\nThe other weird thing is this seems to only be a problem for the type of games that publishers care for, because there are tons of games everyone happily emulates and runs without a care given in the world if someone sells copies of it even. Atari being the biggest example of that. You can buy remade cartridges of some of their stuff on stores without a care in the world, but same era Nintendo stuff and you end up in jail.\n\nWhen only a select amount of publishers care to this level there should never be a blanket argument that something is just or unjust, because evidently the rights holders themselves have different opinions on that.\n\nPreserved books are used for entertainment.  Preserved films too.\n\nIt turns out, that there is value to society in entertainment.\n\nPublishers terrified of the thought of someone, somewhere, doing anything that they feel like they could monetize but aren’t.\n\nNo surprise there but that the US copyright system would think protecting that interest is more important than those of society’s is a real take.\n\nThis is an onion post right\n\nGod I wish it was. Too bad it's true.\n\nThank god its only in the US\n\nHalleluja to the civilized world\n\nLucky me\n\nthey are so desperate and cornered by their own sick business policies that they are afraid of their own shadow. there needs to be a change in video game development or a total collapse and start over again. it's a too big and juicy a market for them, they try to screw us in any way to give a few more millions to investors\n\nI mean, it feels like its coming since nearly every AAA game this year seemingly isn't doing so well sales wise.\n\nThere will always be an underground market for this kind of thing though as a result. \n\nLike it or not its going to happen. Game preservation will continue. They're just going to have to deal with the fact that these companies are circling the drain due to their own greed.\n\nThe consumer will always win.\n\nWhat's even worse is that game ~~makers~~ publishers have been known to actively oppose the sale of used games. They seem to think that they are owed something if the legally-purchased physical copy changes hands. We don't kick back to the original contractor when a house is sold, do we? Nor to the auto manufacturing plant when a car is sold...?\n\nIIRC, they even went to court to try to stop GS from buying/selling used games. When that didn't work, at least one of them (probably EA) locked some features away in some games via a single-use code that came with all new copies; if someone got the game used, welp, that'll cost extra. In essence, a paywall closing off game features *that had already been paid for!*\n\nI was gonna post this but looked before. This is absolutely insane. We have libraries that do this with books and movies and cds. But not video games? It’s because these corporate clowns want to screw us and try and make as much money as possible. It’s not about the art. It’s about money\n\nCapitalism would absolutely destroy libraries if it could.\n\nA lot of libraries have video games available now.\n\nThis is one of those things that needs a law but won't because the lawmakers are all old fossils that were adults before computers even had widespread adoption. Games that have been out of print 20-25 years should be fair game if there's no other legal way they're available.\n\nI get to replay many of my favorites because emulation exists and there's no other avenue to do so beyond owning the original hardware and software, which is increasingly becoming more difficult.\n\nThe age of lawmakers is actually really important here. It's like a discussion I had with my in-laws: to them, games are Tetris, Pong, early Mario. They don't have a concept of video games telling complex stories like what you'd see in a book, movie, or TV show.\n\n When I explained The Last of Us, Halo, and Fallout to them, they were absolutely mind blown at how complex games are now and how they have stories so good that they're getting adapted to other media (sometimes well, and sometimes...not). \n\nThere's this prevailing assumption among the older generations that video games are still just what you'd see during the early Atari era and that nothing has changed, so it shouldn't matter to adults.\n\nI don't know the solution to the problem. But that's a huge part of the battle that needs to be understood in order to fight for media preservation.\n\nI think part of the problem is the secondary market and collectors. If the product is freely aviable, then their 10 000 euro worth mint condition video game loses it's value.\n\nA similar thing happened with magic the gathering reserved list \"The Reserved List was created in the wake of the protests of *Magic* card [collectors](https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Collector) and players when a lot of their cards had been devalued with the release of [*Fourth Edition*](https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Fourth_Edition) and [*Chronicles*](https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Chronicles).\"\n\n“The speculators on the secondary market will lose money if digital versions of these games are freely available.”\n\nJust sounds like an added bonus to me. Like those guys can get fucked, speculators ruin the market for nearly all of my hobbies. \n \nGames are for playing, comics are for reading and guns are for shooting. If you’re buying and hoarding this stuff to try make a profit you’re just an asshole. Lol\n\nThis is incredibly sad. Gaming is an art form that should be preserved like any other.\n\nThese companies need to be torn down. Absolutely sick society.\n\nGood publishers should be very afraid. It's about keeping good games alive not eating the slop they serve.\n\nThe problem is that publishers are treated as legitimate participants in the conversation instead of outsiders with no rights.\n\nImagine book publishers saying that old books have to be destroyed because people may want to read them for entertainment.\n\nFor fuck's sake, can we all agree, at least, that a society where we produce art so someone pays for it and then we try to destroy that art because we don't care about it, we just wanna make sure companies can be paid again later; is not how we want our society to work?\n\nPiracy is the only way to ensure history does not get deleted.\n\nWe need better leaders...\n\nThe VGHF was arguing for letting people play games from a library’s online catalog, kind of the way you can listen to a Taylor Swift album on Hoopla. They were told people have to physically go to a copy to play it. \n\nIt’s absurd because there’s so many instances where game developers didn’t save source code or any assets from a game. Like if you want to study “Panzer Dragoon Saga,” a game that costs hundreds used where the source code is lost so a remaster would be a complete remake, you have to hunt down a copy or use that dirty word, EMULATION. \n\nOr consider “No One Lives Forever,” a game where nobody’s quite sure who owns the rights and it’s not profitable enough to figure out. Who’s hurt if you could stream this from a video game library? Nobody, but that’s not the point according to US government. \n\nLuckily this can come up again but it’s just silly. \n\nOh no think of the poor publshers.\n\nThe news games have gotten so bad that it's become better to just buy old titles on steam lol. Save money too.\n\nIts death by a thousand cuts until you have no ownership to anything. Its happening in every medium, and every industry. \n\nCut cut cut, until all thats left is what capital, labor, or blood they can crush out of you.\n\nCould have a conversation about greed, but you get a shitload of apologists saying that everything companies are doing is good and is helping, or a pedantic argument about \"they aren't required to do X or Y as a company,\" like that is a reason to shit on everyone and everything.\n\nThat's a misleading headline. This involved researchers getting access to out of print games for studying. It's not about the public having access, though it would open the door to that in the future.\n\nThe publishers claimed it would be copyright infringing, and that researchers wouldn't be able to play games for solely educational purposes. They'd have too much fun! \n\nThe judge also stated that in the long term, this could damage the existing market for out of print games. She probably has a sealed copy of Little Samson, lol.\n\nwhen you think about it.\nif we all wouldn't buy the latest bullshit it would be just like the board game market. without micro transactions the whole aaa market would be dead.\n\nBecause despite all their ingenuity, these geniuses could not design planned obsolescence into their videogames. They did not expect there to be such a market for old school games when the economy is shit and half the $70 games coming out are on recycled technology from 2013.\n\nSo instead they fight for the freshness of their product the only way they can: Shell out stupid amounts of money to get the \"no\" they need from the copyright office so we are trapped in a subscription scheme, or forced to buy the remaster.\n\nBut eh, wtf do i know. I'm just some overaged kid who likes Pokemon.\n\nI wonder when Nintendo employees will finally knock on my door and smash my old SNES with the cartridges and sue me for the life of my first born child.\n\nSuch events are the reason why I unironically think piracy is an important factor in gaming culture.\n\nIf everything fails, pirates won't.\n\nI wish it wouldn't be necessary, but that's entirely the fault of the legislators and the industry.\n\nNot shocking at all, this is basically the most anti consumer hobby/artistic medium on earth. And we all just accept it.\n\nAt this point I'm just hoping to see the current gaming industry crash so that something better might rise in its place in my lifetime.\n\nImagine movies not being preserved because rich assholes only wanted you to watch new ones\n\ngod forbid video games are used for recreational purposes!\n\nBooks and music are both preserved for the enjoyment of future generations. The fact that video games(and lots of software) is, won't be, or can't be, is gonna be a gut punch once the ability to play originals or emulate is lost. Lost media is a horrible thing.\n\nWell duh, how else are companies supposed to sell you a 30 year old game?\n\nIn that case I’ll maintain my own library of ROMs and emulate them whenever I like\n\nEnough of a backlog going back to NES that I don’t need to buy the shitty cash grabs and remasters of modern gen until the games drop in price and go on sale\n\nPublishers can go and eat a bag of dicks, though they’re probably monetising each dick nowadays\n\nanyone else feel peglegs and single eye patches growing on you while reading the article?\n\nThis is what happens when 70 year olds with no knowledge about the subject matter are allowed to run the government and make the laws.\n\nwhat about old music?! and old books? aren't those a problem too? their greed makes my blood boil\n\nBeen saying for a long time - They're future-actively killing retro gaming.\n\nIt's quite easy for us in 2024 to play a game from 1984. How hard is it going to be for my kid in 2050 to even play a game from 2010 with all the long dead online components and piecemeal content scattered through post-launch updates, let alone stuff from 1990 which will have been being fought over for 80 years by that point.\n\nThe future is bleak for this media and particularly for these ground-breaking earliest decades of home videogaming.\n\nTo sum it up for people that don't want to read the whole article, which seems to be most of the people in the comments: \n\nThey were worried that video game libraries intended for research and preservation would be accessed by people that had no interest in either and just wanted to play free games. And since they couldn't prove that this wouldn't be the case, they lost.\n\nObviously, who gives a shit if people get to play old games for free, but it isn't as comedically absurd as the editorializing makes it seem.\n\nPublishers are terrified that people will use preserved versions of games to... \\*checks notes\\* play preserved games.\n\n\"preserved video games would be used for recreational purposes,\" My brother in crist THATS WHAT ALL MEDIA PRESERVATION IS FOR."

And the absurdity that came out with each additional picture. Hi fellow old redditor! 👋\n\nI still think the peak reddit moment was the double wammy of ice-soap and 2 am chili occurring on the same day.\n\nDo you have the link. I remember it but i don't know how to find it.\n\nI don’t know either. I just remember it was referenced a year or so ago about it being its 10 year anniversary or something.\n\nI kinda miss old reddit. Like unidan and that guy from the Lizard gaming forum. Sometimes I think about the jumper cables guy. Mostly what I miss is my old account.\n\n/r/museumofreddit\n\nSame, shitty watercolor, etc\n\nGoogle “Hey Reddit, what tattoos do you have?”, it should be top post from 14y ago. \n\nI’m assuming links are against sub rules from all the removed posts.\n\n&gt;HOW DID YOU MAKE THE PICTURE???\n\nHere we go again!\n\nFriends arm is holding the beer.\n\nALL the arms are mine bruv\n\nFound the octopus\n\nDifficult one to catch...

Banging restaurant\n\nThe Cure from Monkeypod was the amazing\n\nGo to roxa!\n\nSorry, I’m not from USA. Is this from Hawaii? Just to be clear. I really enjoy sunset on photo. Wanna add this place to “visit after war end” list\n\nIt is Honolulu, Hawaii. Yes. About 5 minutes walk from the famous Waikiki. \n\nHawaii is amazing but I would recommend one of the other islands, like Maui.\n\nAfter war’s end brother, you can go island hopping, visit Oahu, Maui, Big Island, and Kauai, see as many sunsets as you like. Stay safe out there\n\nBrother when the war ends, hit me up. I’ll buy your ticket to Hawaii. You deserve it. Stay safe!\n\nYes, it’s from Honolulu specifically Waikiki beach. Really beautiful place.\n\n[deleted]\n\nGet a plate lunch with mac salad, best shit ever\n\nUgh I miss Waikiki\n\nThe vibes were immaculate. Absolutely loved staying there\n\nI knew it just by the color of the buildings haha.\n\nWas thinking the same thing with the buildings and ocean. That area has a real specific look to it\n\n[deleted]\n\nBad angle of the photo. The shit is safe! \n\nHoly shit I'm relieved. Thank you!\n\nNothing being held at arms length is safe. Babies, rabid dogs, and especially steam decks. Tuck that mfer in close to the belly.\n\nPray to God he don't drop that shit\n\nDo you know what you can do with an aluminum tube?!\n\nI got some yellow cake right here\n\nHolla.

The person below about to get clonked in the head with a nintendo switch like an angry mario descending from the sky to stomp a goomba probably will argue your point though.\n\nToo wide for a switch... I think it's a steam deck\n\nok I stand corrected. Like an angry Gabe Newell falling from the sky to stomp a...uhh..combine. sure.\n\nNah bro it's the Nintendo piracy device so it fits anyways\n\nNow I only picture Gabe Newell dressed as mario doing the stomping, lol.\n\nRule 34\n\nThat does not apply to anything Gabe Newell. It has a 3 in it.\n\nTouche\n\n[hl2_metrocop_death.wav](https://youtu.be/r-YOIIrVJE0?si=0__G9ByL_t0uu0ys)\n\nGet with the times old man, that’s a steam deck!\n\nhey I'm not old, I'm poor!\n\nTo solve how it was done:\n- Set timer to 10 seconds\n- Look up\n- Place phone in mouth\n- Grab Deck and Drink\n- hope for the best picture\n\nOption #2:\n\n\nGet married and ask for pic 😜\n\nAha, I failed the task before it even began with your method.\n\nHahahaha, love the response!\n\noption 2 seems harder lol\n\nI can’t think of a more Reddit thing to do than taking a trip to Hawaii, staring at a beautiful sunset, and choosing to stay inside and play Stardew valley on a handheld 😂\n\nI'm just loving the irony of playing a rural farming simulator while being in a city, the  using that title.\n\nYou never know. I made the grave error of posting my steam deck at the beach and had people roasting me for not enjoying my vacation.\n\nIt wasn't a vacation, it was a 5 minute walk from my house. For me it was a Tuesday.\n\nHawaii looks nice\n\nLooks like Waikikii..\nEnjoy!\n\nSure is!\n\nThere is a Dave and Busters near by.  Whenever I travel interisland I spend half a day there.\n\nThe one by the movie theater?\n\nOhhh so that’s where the steam deck fell from.\n\nGive it back pls 😭\n\nNah nah 😝🏃🏾‍♂️💨\n\nSo how did OP take the photo?\n\nOpen mouth wide, put phone in, press button with tongue. Ez.\n\nSir or ma’am I say this with all respect, first in foremost have a great time gaming and chilling. Second never mix alcohol high ledges and handhelds. If you dropped that and it hit a bystander you’d be pretty bummed about the game, not to mention the fact you’ll drop it during an incredible scene.\n\nNot to be that guy, but just so you know, it's \"first and foremost\".\n\nWell son of a bitch. I should have never taken high school for granite.\n\nthats the fivemost thing to remember\n\nAt least someone’s life is.\n\nWORKING ON THE WEEKENDS LIKE USUAL!1! 🦅🦅\n\nI was shaken just looking at the picture here. Get yer ass off that ledge please. And don’t hold your SteamDeck like that. That’s a treasure, would be a shame if you dropped it off 20 th floor. No amount of DIY repairs would cut it to put it back together. Boy I am getting old. That amount of rant over one single picture. Jesus!\n\n[deleted]\n\nListen to the voices\n\nMaybe for you\n\nNext thing you know the phone or whatever it is goes all the way down with the can to give Mother Earth a warm hug 💀\n\ndrops steam deck\n\nIf you have to come onto Reddit to brag about how good life is, your life probably isn't that good\n\n**Skrillex drop it hard!** (phone start falling 30 peters  off the balcony)\n\n?? I was there in Feb... Ala Moana will be a great location.\n\nLiving the dream!\n\nHawaii recommendation #3489 and #3490: eat at Marukame Udon in Waikiki and go to turtle bay resort up on the north shore, go to the hotel beach (beach at the hotel sucks cause everyone at the hotel just goes there).  Just face the ocean from the beach start walking to the right along the beach. No one goes over there really and there are some chill places to just sit and hang out, go in the water etc.\n\n...might wanna put that can down and hold the big ticket item with 2 hands...\n\n*loses balance for half a second*\n\nThere goes\n\nDon’t Drop Anything 🫣\n\nthen it slip from your hand on that position. greaaaaaaat\n\nis nobody wondering how tf he is taking the photo\n\nHow'd you take the picture lol?\n\nAnything for a picture lmao\n\nWho’s taking the picture?\n\nDon‘t you have third arm? We all have it.\n\nAll I can think of is that at the next moment the device gets dropped down the building\n\nNice photo, but It stresses me a little\n\nOnly if you have money.\n\nHow did you take that picture?\n\nSeconds before disaster\n\nImagine if you drop this switch... GOD NO\n\nI wish I was wealthy enough to hold steamdeck over balcony like this.\n\nI've been playing Stardew Valley mobile. I'm impressed with the interface and ease of use.\n\nI know waikiki when I see it\n\n*breathes in*  \nDO NOT DROP THAT.\n\nthat looks like heaven\n\n\"Life could be dream\" well, at least not mine\n\nAt least until you drop it\n\nPerfect gaming spot. Beautiful\n\nMy anxiety level is through the roof like how tf are you able to do this shit without panicking\n\nIs the phone in your mouth?\n\nJust make sure you have a good grip on the handheld.\n\nOp got 3 arms\n\nF. I was hoping that nobody will notice!\n\nI love Stardew Valley\n\nLife fucking sucks and it will only get worse\n\nI knew it! Some people have three hands!\n\nDid you *need* to dangle it over the edge for this pic?\n\nCringe\n\nThis pic made me really happy for some reason!\n\nI am so loaded with positive thoughts and energy right now my fiend! It goes over 9000 reading your comment!\n\ngreat shot, great game, not a great beer. see if you can find some Kohola Brewery. they were a small brewer on Maui before the fire, and are running again with Maui Brew Co help.\n\nPhotoception\n\nThat's some view. Love it.\n\nI feel like I was in that exact condo last year at PCB same view and all lol\n\nNow accidently drop the phone from the balcony\n\nMy favorite beer! Hang loose!\n\nFantastic view!\n\nSomeone’s in Waikiki.\n\nDrop that phone and someone on the street will be playing Frontal Cortex Valley...\n\nI would probably try and stifle the laugh but by god know it is there im afraid.\n\nIt's sad that u/Bethesda killed the Doom 2016 Switch multiplayer servers. Because one of the sickest pleasures I ever had, dear u/SobigX , was playing Deathmatch while riding the subways in Singapore. And sadly, you won't get to experience it. I would want you to, because years ago, I had a room somewhere adjacent to where you're currently staying and it reminded me of my last time in Singapore on business.\n\nI know the sunset in waikiki anywhere, have a good stay OP! I have lived here my whole life but it's funny that locals can recognize the view in a heartbeat.\n\nI've never played Stardew, but I do know that Kona makes some tasty fucking beers. Nice.\n\nthat remains a dream for me. i just want to chill at some point and play.\n\nLife’s great my friend. Sending good vibes!\n\nOkay but you need to let us know how the farm is going\n\nI wish i was home i miss Hawai’i, active duty life sucks.. \n💪🏽😎🤙🏽\n\nYes the town with ABC Stores on every corner.\n\nHappy for you man.\n\nWho's taking the photo lmao\n\nUntil you drop it.  This seems way too risky.\n\nLG commercial?\n\nThe game is dope. How's the brew?\n\nHey it's my old view!\n\nPlz don’t drop that 😬\n\nI still play Stardew valley every now and then. Such a simple but really good game.\n\nIs there anything special about your left thumb? Or my eyes are playing tricks on me?\n\nWhat city is this bro?\n\nI genuinely don't understand how people have the confidence to hold their expensive electronic product over the railing like that. It's just asking for trouble 😂\n\nIs Stardew Valley on mobile even that good? I can imagine the controls not being great.\n\nCool to see Hawaii on the front page haha. Lived here in O'ahu all my life. Enjoy the island!\n\n[deleted]\n\nBefore your phone fall from 17th floor(or whatever floor this guy is living on)\n\nYeah it is 😎\n\nDont trow it, you will miss it\n\nWhich I could post my own image but they won’t let me reply with one):\n\nDo you have 3 hands?"

For old times sake…\n\nIs that in the game?\n\nYes, SS gets the nickname from their vault suit\n\nunfortunate acronym\n\nThey get it even if you don't have your vault suit when you meet her. She just has different dialogue to justify it.\n\n*Shh. Play along. What was that? You said you’re a trader up from Quincy? You have enough supplies to keep the general store stocked for a whole month? Huh.*\n\nThe way she calls her \"Crazy Myrna\" in front of her husband is brutal.\n\nCourtney Ford's performance is spot on, she made Piper my fav companion (Dance a close #2 obvs).\n\nReally only #2?\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpxLzl4nm04\n\n\nSold yet?\n\nOk. That was fkn hilarious. xD\n\nHow the hell did I not recognize her voice? I've watched Legends of Tomorrow like 15 times!\n\nShe was also on Dexter too, back in the day.\n\nAnother fun fact, she's married to Brandon Routh.\n\nPeak\n\nLiterally unplayable. Piper uses a 10mm not a Pipe Revolver /s.\n\nNice Cosplay.\n\nShe uses what you give her.\n\nI either live dangerously and give her a missile launcher or the mini gun because I never use it\n\nFatman after the perk that prevents her from killing you with it\n\ntime for another playthrough...\n\n\n\n*loads Vortex for the billionth time...*\n\nI give her my heart whenever I play as Nora\n\nTricky to do when you also play the institute path\n\nI realize it's cringey but I had Piper equip the wedding ring.\n\nI give her trust issues as I close a door in her face so she gets mauled by a death claw instead of me.\n\nBut why would you give Piper a Pipe Revolver? It's one of the worst guns in the game.\n\nBecause you can't spell Piper without Pipe.\n\nAh, I see someone's also seen Girls Of The Vault\n\nYou can’t spell PipeRevolver without PipeR!\n\nMine uses the world series bat\n\nYou look awesome! Well done.\n\nAbsolutely bad ass. My favorite cosplay outfit I’ve seen this year!\n\nditto\n\nYOU DEVIOUS RABBLE ROUSING SLANDERERERRERERRRRR!\n\nEveryone liked that.\n\n\"What?  Am I supposed to wish my way over there?\"\n\nFinger off the trigger, smoothskin.\n\nupvote for putting the game in the title!\n\nDamn! Really well made!\n\nKnew exactly what it was good job! That pipe pistol is awesome\n\nThat’s an awesome jacket.\n\nHey Blue\n\nNeato! I'm wearing a Vault suit today. Too bad I can't post it because of the karma rule.\n\nLOVE! LOVE! LOVE!\n\nMy favorite journalist\n\nWell done, but if you're going 100% accuracy, Piper carried a 10mm pistol.\n\nwhile that may be true, she uses what ever you give her, and perhaps OP always gave her a pipe pistol.\n\nWhat's that? Everyone needs a minigun you say?\n\nCurie gets the Gatling Laser in every one of my playthroughs without fail. \n\nSomething about the plaid button-down and a giant laser weapon just makes me very happy.\n\nTry Hancock or Capn' Highliner (Longfellow) with the Broadsider. There is no more thematic shit.\n\nEvery minigun I pick up is immediately going into one of my settler's hands. It's absolutely hilarious watching settlers armed with mini guns mow down Raiders and Gunners when they try to attack.\n\nMy second favorite companion, aside from Cait (or as I call her, the missus). The cosplay is cherry and you should be proud of it!\n\nCait is my favorite. I always bawl my eyes out.\n\nShe is such a sweetheart once you get through that exterior.\n\n Which one is you?\n\nThis looks amazing!\n\nReally well done!\n\nDamn, that’s!actually so accurate!\n\nReally really well done! Good job.\n\nNail'd it! Really well done!\n\nDead on wow\n\nNice pipe pistol\n\nActual Piper cosplays always have five guys in the background\n\nYou're missing 10 ft of forehead butapart from that awesome cosplay\n\nOk legit awesome, great job\n\nIs this ai? Too cool\n\nExcellent work 👏!!\n\nVery awesome, great colors.  Happy Halloween!\n\nDamn! how long did it take to source the costume? Is the pistol 3d printed or metal scraps?\n\nkudos on the cosplay!\n\nAwesome! Love all the props you've been making\n\nYou nailed it along with the pipe revolver too\n\nNailed it!\n\nThis looks awesome.\n\nWhoa.. that's an awesome Piper! You better give McDonough a run for his money!\n\nI forget what franchise it was but there was once a creator who married a woman because she was a cosplayer of his favorite character. I think it was a batman cartoon?\n\nThat's great\n\nIf you call me blue one more time i'm shooting you in the foot.\n\nOh, good job.\n\nYou can't fool me. That's just a screenshot of Piper\n\nThis is spectacular.\n\nTop notch!\n\nIt's Halloween you can say costume today\n\nWell done!   Great job putting it all together.  The jacket is amazing.\n\nEither that's more detailed than the actual game. Or my graphics card really sucks.\n\nPiper, my queen. My muse.\n\nvery nice\n\nAmazing. I had such a crush on Piper. It felt so nice to have her by my side as we roamed the world and have our little chats.\n\nNow you need yourself a Blue!\n\nneat\n\nOn the one hand, very cool. On the other, any FO4 content reminds me that a settlement needs my help!\n\nWow\n\nYOOOO\n\nThe weathering and shading on the leather turned out really good, great work!\n\nYes.\n\nWhere's Nat?\n\nRAD\n\nVery nice!\n\nOn Halloween, we can call it a costume haha\n\nI kinda want to wear that jacket every day\n\nwow this is really good!\n\nDamn, you look very sexy.\n\nGreat job! One of the best companions in the game.\n\nAnnnnnd i love you\n\nFabulous\n\nthis is amazing! great job 🙏🏼😍\n\nMy favorite companion!\n\nNice pilot from Power Stone costume\n\nMy favorite companion in F4. Great costume!\n\nHoly shit\n\n11 out of 10\n\nThe outfit is great, but seriously are you a professional makeup artist? There are people who would kill for that eye and eyebrow look.\n\nThis is literally the first time ever I've seen a cosplay randomly pop up in my feed and I actually knew who the character is \n\nI can hear your nagging now &lt;3\n\nI don't know who Piper is but you look cool\n\nIt looks like someone got a face mod because damn. That cosplay looks dirty but she herself is all clean. 🧼\n\nFantastic setup\n\nI love that the costume looks used, weathered, and not brand new off the rack like some cosplays\n\nThis looks great.\n\nLittle suggestion if you're looking for more piper cosplay prrops:\n\nThe photo camera used as the basis for the one in fallout is the Browne Hawkeye (or, at least it's close enough). They're still out there.\n\nEither way, amazing work!\n\nYou rock\n\nNice, you even have a bit of a Courtney Ford look about you\n\nlol my dumbass was sitting here trying to figure out which one was you and which was in-game Piper for way too long before I realized both are you and both have you holding your phone.\n\nCool costume either way!\n\nThat is spot on! Great work\n\nAbsolutely amazing!\n\nI like fallout yeiii\n\n[deleted]\n\nVery cool! I'm just happy when I see non-sexualized cosplay.\n\nSo cool! I like it!!\n\nBeautiful 😳\n\nWow. Spot on!\n\nYou look incredible!  You nailed it. And that's an awesome pipe pistol too.\n\nGreat Piper cosplay! She became the only companion I adventured with in Fallout 4  VR. I loved her character. ❤️ Thanks for bringing her to life!\n\nFucking awesome 👏🏽\n\nA real costume. 🙇\n\nWas it pied for?\n\nNice phone case\n\nThis look is so so so cool😍\n\nLol spot on\n\nI would double click...\n\nWomen on dating apps: \"I like going out and hanging with friends and want a guy that's not into games and knows how to treat me right\".\n\nMeanwhile on Halloween: *Dresses up as your fantasy from one of your favorite games of all time.\n\nI'm mostly joking, but fr I never see this on anyone's profile. Or is it an algorithm thing? Any app suggestions? HELP\n\nOh wow. Actual cosplay today and not OF BS cosplay. Shit looks dope too.\n\nThat leather must have been pricey! Well worth it!\n\nAh yes piper before the mods\n\nNever seen a piper cosplay before, Looks great!!\n\nLiterally playing this right now. You nailed the look perfectly! Fantastic job!\n\nWow very faithful cosplay, good work! How did you get the coat to look like that? Some kind of leather aging process?\n\nToday it's called a Halloween costume.\n\nWait... There are female cosplayers that do it for fun instead of promoting their OF? Well... You did a really good job on it\n\nI like it, pretty good. I would like it better without make up and rough hair, since she is in the nuclear wasteland\n\nI'd believe this is a mod. Looks great.\n\nNow this is some high quality cosplay.\n\nNice piper costume\n\nGenuinely my favorite companion\n\nawesome work!\n\nI'm such an idiot I was looking left and right trying to figure out which one was from the game.\n\nI thought I left you manning artillery! Get back before the next raid\n\nFallout was an amazing tv series 10/10\n\nFollowing you on IG because this is awesome\n\nThat looks RAD (pun not intended)\n\nSo bad ass! 😮‍💨\n\nWhy isn’t she this 🔥 in game\n\nIncredible!\n\nNah you a synth. I met the real piper in diamond city.\n\nNice costume, I hate Piper\n\nYou nailed the dead, soulless eyes.\n\nOh shit that's really well done.\n\nNever played Fallout but this is amazing!!! Loving the detail, especially on the pistol(?).\n\nYour costume is pretty on the money.\n\nI can already see you blocking the door.\n\nthat's pretty awesome well done\n\nForever in awe at people’s skill in cosplaying!\n\nYou even capture the graphics look even though it’s real life\n\nGod damnit, I just want to get into Diamond City already\n\nI love the Pipe gun\n\nI'd piper.\n\nI love Piper! And the voice acting is top notch. She - and Strong - needs to be protected.\n\nYour thoughts?\n\nYou wore it better.\n\nTuff.\n\nWOW! This is literally perfect. Amazing job\n\nNice cosplay. you looks like a fashionista\n\nCool that it’s actually weathered, really good job!\n\nFabulous!\n\nPiper with a pipe pistol. Hooo, boy alliteration is fun. You absolutely crushed it. Love it.\n\nvery nice and nice looking\n\nGenuinely fucking amazing\n\nOh, what a great cosplay, it's on point, immediately recognized her."

    "all_comment_text": "And then mirror's edge came out and didn't feature so much as a teaspoon of piss in its entire run-time\n\nStill has one the best colour palettes and art style ever. It's so crisp and clear, even today.\n\nIt should be in a museum. And we should get a good successor.\n\nYou know what would make it feel museum worthy?\n\nA nice sepia filter. hahaha\n\nIn Breaking Bad, this is how you know you're in Mexico\n\nIf I ever travel to Mexico and it doesn't look like that I'm going to be very disappointed.\n\nI've had the sequel sitting in my steam library for ever but have yet to play it still. Didn't know it wasn't well received.\n\nWhat'd they do to fuck it up?\n\nIt's okay. Not bad, but it falls severely short when compared to the first. \n\nThe open world is rather repetitive as in you'll always run the same runs to traverse between areas. Combat isn't optional like in the first, it's forced on you.\n\nWhat’s weird is the ugly grasp of how guns felt in Mirrors edge, it wasn’t glorified or even incentivized. It felt genuinely disgusting for the first time, even when it was bad guys, no hud, no bullet counter, no gratuitous blood. Strong stuff without even trying to say anything or attempt heavy handed commentary. \n\nThe same dirty feeling you get in racing games when you bank your car full-speed at the turn by just ramming into the computer opponents already turning.\n\nksiskk\n\nFound the guy /r/Simracingstewards  hates\n\nI have absolutely taken corners too hot specifically knowing I’m going to pin the bastard who’s already braking to the fuckin barrier and I’ll do it again.\n\nEspecially since my gf and friends can’t drive for shit. I gotta put the whole convoy on my back and keep first place.\n\nHave you tried The Finals? its artstyle is very much Mirrors Edge.\n\nIf you like parkour games for the parkour then you'll like it. If the flying/gliding glitch isn't patched you could have a lot of fun exploring out of bounds with that too.\n\nAgreed, even if I had to lower the brightness and saturation, because my eyeballs started to liquefy.\n\nHelps that the setting was \"clean, futuristic dystopian city\". The piss filter was for reserved for messy, wartorn hellscapes.\n\n\"Messy, wartorn hellscapes,\" is a fictionalized depiction of mid 2000s NYC. Yeah, I reckon that tracks.\n\nTo my knowledge, they initially had planned to make it look a lot grittier and dirtier, but during development they realized that the clinical, high-contrast look of their early dev builds actually fit the setting and narrative really well, so they decided to lean into that instead of adding an extra layer of dirt and grime to everything.\n\nThere was a recent convo in this sub (I think) about this and I believe the art director or some such said they backed into the color palette while trying to figure out how to give the user clues through the level.  E.g. red pipes can be climbed\n\nOne of the greatest games of all time.\n\nI remember buying my first PhysX card to play that (and a couple of other games that used it) in high detail with all the materials and stuff.\n\nWhat a game, what an era.\n\nApparently, \"Next Gen Graphics\" meant \"Sepia tone\".\n\nDidn't you know? Real is brown.\n\nNowadays “real” means throwing the saturation up all the way.\n\nI cannot emphasize more that Infamous 1-2 are 2 of the best and still most realistic looking games to date for me, they will *always* have a special place in my heart(and my arm, i got a tatoo inspired by the games not too long ago lol).\n\nGrew up with it since i was 12, i’m 25 now and they aged like a fine wine, well atleast Infamous 2 did, obviously the first game is inferior to the second game in this case with Cole Mcgrath all low poly lookin’ lmao.\n\nSaturation all the way up, and adding emissions and reflectivity to everything.\n\n&gt;reflectivity to everything.\n\n* Makes every surface reflective, every puddle is a straight up mirror.\n* \"We just gotta add RT, it's a selling point of the console!\"\n* Nothing looks realistic, nothing looks significantly different than traditional lighting and reflections.\n* Performance hit of 30%.\n\nWasn't RT meant to be the gateway to true to life lighting and color?  So far it's basically been a gimmick with the best application apparently being rainy roads and puddles.\n\n&gt; Wasn't RT meant to be the gateway to true to life lighting and color? So far it's basically been a gimmick with the best application apparently being rainy roads and puddles.\n\nThe big tech demos back when the Nvidia RTX cards launched all focused on things like close cover reflections in metallic surfaces informing the player of dangers coming up behind them, hallway lighting giving away approaching enemies, that kind of gameplay-affecting stuff. Imagine if we actually got that instead of just shiny water checklist nonsense.\n\nI think the issue with that is if you're designing a game that uses reflection as a gameplay mechanic, then you have to cut off the people who are unable to play with RT from playing your game.\n\nThat's why RT is basically used as a \"nice to have\" checkbox.\n\nbest use is a torch in a cramped cave, a la Demon's Souls. Game looks ridiculous\n\nDemon's Souls doesn't even use RT lol\n\nHuh, no shit? One of those weird facts like hearing one of the best looking 4k discs, blade runner 2049, doesn't use HDR or Dolby vision (cuz deakins apparently hates it)\n\nYeah it's crazy how they made that game so good looking with traditional techniques.\n\nAlso didn't know that about 2049! Love that movie\n\nReflective surfaces are the most noticeable impact raytracing has but I feel like there are much more and often more subtle improvements playing CP77 on ultra RT. What I am most impressed by is how light exposure does not only influence the object in the world but also how the player perceives it. So if the player model itself moves from light to dark it kind of mimics how your eyes would adapt and your vision would change. Getting blinded by driving out of a tunnel is the type of realism I didn't know I lacked before.\n\n\nThere's an option for path tracing which I think is new and improved lighting I guess but it crashes my PC so I wouldn't know if it actually is.\n\nPlease for the love of God, never ever abbreviate cyberpunk\n\nbut there are 77 of them\n\nAt least this guy put a 77 on it. Most cyberpunk fans only us CP. There was a post not too long ago on the main cyberpunk subreddit where they all doubled down and essentially said it's perfectly normal to use the CP abbreviation and they'll start banning anyone who mentions how weird it is lol\n\nevery time i watch a game with ray tracing, i feel like i'm going insane because nobody ever talks about the UNBELIEVABLE ghosting.  i can't imagine playing a game like that\n\nInfamous 1-2 looked pretty different tho.\n\n1 was really gray and gritty, 2 was super colorful\n\nnobody recognizing the VGcats reference?    \nhttps://vgcats.com/comics/?strip_id=222\n\nNow that's a name I haven't heard in many years.\n\nHalo 3 was basically the only mature shooter around the 06-09 period that shipped with a more normal/colourful pallet.\n\nTo make fun of the trend, I remember Halo 3 had in-game filters that you could place on custom maps to change the colour tone, and one of them was named \"next gen\" which added the dull/piss colour to everything. Back when Bungie and Halo were incredibly based.\n\nMass Effect was also colorful! Technically a third person shooter. Gears 2 also brought color back, though I do love the dark Gothic vibes of Gears 1. One of the few games where it felt appropriate since the setting was so grim. The muzzle flashes lit everything up so starkly, so good *chef's kiss*\n\nthey went ham with the jj abrams flares too.\n\nOh yeah, kinda love it honestly. Especially in mass effect. Wouldn't look the same without the sun flare lights.\n\nNowadays mean \"wet floor\".\n\nEvery GTAV \"hyper realism\" mod showcase, just fucking drenched 24/7. Although the new realism trend seems to be the 720p GoPro looking games because people finally realized it's much easier just to emulate actual camera footage and low resolution with a bunch of artifacts hides lighting and texture issues.\n\nI'm just waiting for folks to pick up on the reason why old movies and games seemed more realistic back in the day was from all the shitty CRTs we watched them on.\n\nAce combat 4 on a 32\" CRT looked fucking real to 12 year old me. PS2 trilogy are so damn good.\n\nNah that's so 2004 and Street Racing Syndicate \n\nToday it's \"more or less puddles\"\n\nBioshock is such a wet floor game.\n\nit's the \"Cinematic Mexico\" tone, also known as third world country tone.\n\nI feel bad for saying this, but I went to an abandoned village in Armenia irl that had been destroyed by an earthquake 30 years ago and, I swear to god, it was sepia toned, even the sky. I sent a pic to my brother and he said it looked like a CoD map.\n\nIt was a really wet village, too. There was a no ear dog trying to fuck the other dogs as the only inhabitants.\n\nI wonder if no ear dog had a good life\n\nThis filter was actually often used to make the lighting better, as it does a pretty good job at hiding inconsistencies and other artifacts.\n\nThe next step in tech after that was when high contrast colors started to show well on high def screens. That was the 2010s era of everything having lens flare with reds &amp; blues. Example:mass effect 2\n\nThey were all shot in Mexico\n\nDamn cartels...\n\nwe should’ve never sent them to Mexico\n\nHector..\n\nThey’re not sending their best filters\n\nRE5 was innovative by importing mexican filters into africa where chris does a small genocide against ~~black people~~ zombies\n\n\nI love that game even though I think it isn't a good game\n\nIt’s just a fun game to couch co-op it was my first or second game for Xbox 360 and I was blown away by the graphics\n\nI do remember how hyped up the whole going from inside to outside brightness shock was. \n\nAnd Chris just Superman punching a boulder, I fucking loved re5\n\nFallout 3 looks weird without the color filter.\n\nThat's only because they used the *heavy* filter as a crutch to make their art assets less complex, and make the low texture resolution less obvious so that the game would actually run on the Xbox 360. Fallout 4 had a much nicer color palette and didn't need to be soaked in piss to hide stuff.\n\nWell, I do use texture and model enhancement mods to help.\n\n4 feels like it has too much colour on the prewar stuff for being 200+ years later\n\nSomewhat, but then again 3 feels like nobody in the past 200 years took a broom to anything, or bothered to move literally any obstacle from even the busiest areas. I do prefer things looking just a little more livelier than they should to things looking a whole lot more dilapidated than they should.\n\nYeah 3 feels like it’s been a few decades since the bombs. Especially since the main plot of 3 revolves around purifying the water\n\nFallout 4 was supposed to represent hope and humanity rebuilding. Todd Howard did say that they should have reduced the atmospheric color a bit more. To fully emphasize the drab and dull world of the apocalypse. But the colorful aspect of the pre War assets was part of the feeling that humanity was coming back. \n\nIt's also why the theme song in 4 was so much more upbeat than 3.\n\nMan I don't care what anyone says, FO4 was a damn good game. One of my favorites.\n\nThat’s the thing though they could easily pull it closer to when FO1 takes place or FO2 as they have a similar idea. FO1 has Shady Sands a completely new built settlement and FO2 has Arroyo a new tribal society just as a few examples. By new built I’m talking about not using the remains of the old world as the foundation\n\n&gt;Arroyo a new tribal society\n\nThis makes me want to put in FO2 tonight.\n\nBut if you textured and colored things realistically based on how long the paint and color of those objects would fade, then the game would lose so much of the 50s retrofuturism aesthetic\n\nFO4 also doesn’t need to be 210 years after the great war and doing that would ease a lot of my criticism about about it\n\nYeah, the sky in fallout 3 should never be blue\n\nBut Nick Valentine in Fallout 4 says he missed the blue sky\n\nBut ironically the sky is blue in FO4. Except in the glowing sea\n\nHe was probably just a big fan of the Ice Age movies before the studio shut down.\n\nNick valentine has memories from before the nuclear war...\n\nI actually think the green filter gives it an eerie sadness, which fits with the tone of the game.\n\nI figured it was just all the radioactive everything \n\nFits with the tone of GTA 4 too. And Gears too. And MGS4 too. Wait........hold on! I'm noticing a pattern!\n\nFellout (the mod)\n\nOne of the only 2 mods needed for that game. The other being better load times because somehow it still loads slowly for fast computers without the patch.\n\nI came here to comment that I think I like FO4 so much because they ditched the yellow and green filters, so I get to feel like I'm actually outside in nature when I play.  Blue skies and all!\n\nI personally really liked the green filter, it made everything feel a lot creepier, more oppressive and lifeless. F04 in my opinion, just feels... bland I guess? I think 76 did the whole color thing a lot better than 4.\n\nDamn. I so desperately want a Resistance Trilogy (bottem left) remake for the ps5.\n\nPlease. Someone. Make it happen.\n\nThere are alot of Franchises that got left behind from the Xbox/PS2 and 360/PS3 era for various reasons..\n\nBut Resistance is absolutely toward the top of that list and I would happily trade having a Resistance franchise instead of many other active FPS franchises.\n\nIts a shame it got left to die as these companies decided to focus on an extremely limited IP portfolio that they planned to build massive franchises out of - So badass games like Resistance that werent making tons of cash back just got left behind.\n\nIf anyone reading this didnt play it at the time, Im not sure how it holds up today, but at the time it came out.. Resistance was fucking cool.\n\nAnd the base idea is so great - Lets make some really cool Ratchet and Clank style guns with weird abilities - but put it into a somber and grim dystopian FPS\n\n&gt; Its a shame it got left to die as these companies decided to focus on an extremely limited IP portfolio that they planned to build massive franchises out of - So badass games like Resistance that werent making tons of cash back just got left behind.\n\nResistance didn't die, it ended. 3 was the conclusion. Humanity won the war\n\nMaybe a small side team from Bluepoint could do it, get a FPS under their belts at the studio and remake a classic PS3 title\n\nI would be so happy if they did this, one of my favorite games at the time.\n\nThanks, it's the first time I see someone on Reddit remembering this game.\n\nIt was one my first ps3 games, so i loved it and i absolutely loved the 2nd one as well.\n\n\"Can you hear them? They're calling to us, it's beautifull\"\n\nI played all 3 games this year. I liked the 3rd one the most.\n\nNever played third one, pls tell how good it is? I love first two, played coop a lot. What was the time\n\nI had one wish left with a genie. I was gonna end world hunger but this… this is a necessity\n\nI don’t\n\nBattlefield 3 showed everyone how stupid the piss filter was when they did the same thing BUT BLUE AND IT LOOKED SICK\n\npiss filter but its hydrated piss\n\nSomething something hydro homies.\n\nBack then, we were allowed to say the original subs name over voice chat.\n\nI heard it a lot! Minus the water part oddly enough.\n\nYou're still allowed to\n\nGo on\n\nSay it\n\n[removed]\n\nGone but not forgotten\n\n....what are you hydrating with? \n\nYall piss blue?\n\nI miss BF3 so much. I missed out on BF2, but the first time I used a sniper and missed because of bullet drop was such a “omg this is sick” moment. Also bowing up my first wall with C4 got the same reaction from me.\n\nthe first time I got caught in The Meat Grinder playing rush on metro was such a thrill. That was the last multiplayer shooter I really loved although some of that could be it was the last shooter I had a group of friends to consistently play with\n\nPlayed the First one which was WW2. Skipped all the way to 3 because Call of Duty sort of sweped up a lot of console shooters and pretty much haven't looked back since. But I think BF1 will always be my all time favorite.\n\nBF1 still has a few very active lobbies on PC. I hop on every now and then and it’s still holds up graphics and all\n\nBlue filter bf3 was the bomb\n\nI remember when BF4 came out without the filter and people at first thought it looked too saturated.\n\nDidn't BF4 had like the whole orange glint thing going on?\n\nBF4 had no tint\n\nI remember everyone hating the blue filter and on PC people were modding it out.\n\nI played through a modded version of Need For Speed Most Wanted, and it's wild how colorful that game is once you get rid of the piss filter.\n\nI was going to tell OP to add Most Wanted to the list. Do you remember the name of the mod?\n\nI had the same experience with GTA:IV last year. There are (finally) some really good PC mods that basically fix the horrible performance, but they also give you the option to get rid of the piss filter. It makes such a difference!\n\nUnsure if this is one of the subreddits that freaks out about YouTube links, but this is the video that has all relevant details in the description:\n\n`NFS Most Wanted REDUX V3 | Ultimate Overhaul, Cars &amp; Graphics Mod in 4K`\n\nI specifically like being able to skip all the padding the game does and speed run the blacklist\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnmeXzm1oQ\n\npretty sure that nobody but OP misses this ugly ass filter on everything\n\nPeople subconsciously associating great games with the terrible filter. \n\nThey were good in spite of it, not because of it.\n\nAgreed\n\n~~Rose~~ piss tinted glasses\n\nMy first thought lol\n\nIt's such an absurd hot take that you gotta respect it.\n\nFirst thing I would do was look up a filter mod if possible. Absolutely hated that trend.\n\nSomehow piss/shit color was more \"\"\"real\"\"\" and somehow when I look outside, piss and shit colors aren't really the dominant color\n\nI very specifically avoided games with the piss filter.\n\nFor real, I hate how the games look despite them being masterpieces. More color all the way imo\n\nThis shit was so ugly lol but man many great games from this era\n\nIt’s part of fallouts identity tho so they get a pass\n\nFor fallout it kind of makes sense given the context.\n\nThe ugly bloom was the fake HDR hype back in the days.\n\nI was just gonna comment that I remember the fucking bloom more than anything else from that era. Every other game looked like it was smeared in vaseline or a dream sequence.\n\nOblivion being the worst\n\nI miss the gameplay of that era moreso than the aesthetic style.\n\nBrother yearns for the turret section\n\n\"ADD ANOTHER QUICK TIME EVENT\"\n\n&lt;but Cap'n, any more and she's gonna blow!&gt;\n\n\"DO IT .. and make the cutscenes leading into it unskippable so that if they fail they have to watch them all the way through every single time!\"\n\n\"How long should the cutscene be?\"\n\n\"Yes\"\n\n- Hideo Kojima\n\n\"That boulder punching bastard.\"\n\nYou mean quick time events and cover shooting?\n\nOh look!  Another waist high wall!\n\nThere's actually a trophy in inFamous 2 for jumping over a fence since you couldn't do that in the first game.\n\nDon't Fence Me In (Bronze): Climb a chain link fence and rejoice.\n\nGameplay peaked at chest high walls, regenerating health and shouting \"hoo-rah.\"\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTm2s5X3G1U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTm2s5X3G1U)\n\nQTEs and turret sections galore lol\n\nI miss being young and being able to be immersed in a COD or Battlefield campaign. \nI replayed several missions from MW on various difficulty. \n\nArguably BO6 seemed to have captured that gameplay experience but I couldn’t put myself through the campaign. I just didn’t care about the characters or shooting AI to be fun. \n\nAnd I only care to play the MP with there is DXP for a few minutes here and there.\n\nI think we underestimate how much the fun of older games came from us, and novelty. Like it was considered fun to just shoot the guys.\n\nI remember renting MGS2 back in the day and never getting past the tanker section because shooting/ambushing guards was just too much fun.\n\nI really…….REALLY don’t\n\nI gotta imagine this era had to be demotivating for texture artists. You create all these custom textures, carefully choosing the colors, and then down the line someone applies a filter to the whole game that saps all color out and turns everything you worked on yellow.\n\nNothing gives me existential dread more than staring at a dreary TV screen.\n\nWhen i play video games im tryna escape into a fun, fantastical world. \n\nI get people have preferences, so maybe this is the world they want to escape to, but for me, video games should look like how Nintendo makes em, bright, fun, higy contrast, and attention grabbing.\n\nI like cyberpunk stuff for a reason, give me so many colorful lights that my retinas are incinerated\n\nMGS4 was arguably the worst about it. Sure I \"get it\" when you're in a sandy desert area like the first area ... but you move to a jungle and to a boat on the sea and it's all still piss\n\nThey did take the filter away for Shadow Moses thankfully \n\nAnd Outer Heaven.\n\nIs incredible how well the game looks on Shadow Moses, specially for a game released very early on the PS3 lifecycle\n\nDefinitely could be a ps4 game. That game was beautiful. Played it back when it released, and on ps plus.\n\nSe-pee-a\n\nReal = brown\n\nThe brown age\n\nI hated it then and I hate it today\n\nDunno why anyone would miss the piss era of games. Thank god we moved past that.\n\nThey miss their childhood. That's all this is.\n\nIt's all any of these \"I miss x\" posts are. Being a kid and playing video games with little cares other than school was great! Being an adult and worrying about being employed, bills, social life etc and working games in somewhere is much less enjoyable.\n\nI don't remember GTA4 having that.\n\niirc it was mostly on Brighton, every other part of Liberty city was either gray or greenish.\n\nThe colour cast changed depending on the time and weather too. It had some beautiful variations with blues and greens. \n\nYeah I found the colours to be very drab in that game\n\nWell, they were trying to emulate NYC.\n\nWell it was more like grayish but it suited the game pretty well because of how the NY was portrayed.\n\nI don't. That whole era of everything being brown, grey and dark green was pretty much video gaming's \"angsty teen phase\".\n\nWe all know the true color of realism is brown.\n\nwhere is Need for Speed most wanted\n\nAbsolutely nuts that nobody's mentioned NFS Most Wanted. The king of the mid-2000s piss filter!\n\nWhere's Deus Ex Human Revolution? It may be the most egregious piss filter example.\n\nNo, that game used the colour yellow to anchor its design language. It wasn't a filter, just yellow elements, that's why it worked so well.\n\nYou mean the best example. That game wore it like a badge of honour and made it work. \n\nShame you can't buy the original version of the game on PC anymore, though. We're stuck with that half-baked Director's Cut. Unless you hunt down one of the remaining Steam keys in the wild.\n\nIs there any mod to restore piss ? Steam version removes it\n\nWhen I first heard this I didn't believe it, even without the filter that game is STILL insanely piss colored\n\nI don't personally. These games were pushing the envelope of photorealism in their time, but many of them aged like milk visually. Sepia filter, Low res textures and models that regularly feel a bit uncanny as the required level of detail just wasn't possible on the hardware of the time. \n\nCompare that to what the 90s did with their colourful sprites or stylized by necessity early 3D graphics or the leap forward in graphics that came with the Xbox One and PS4 era and the late 2000s just end up feeling like gaming's edgy phase.\n\nI dont think any\"era of gaming\" has aged worse than those. They already had similar aspirations than we have now, but without most of the technical possibilities. And its not just graphics, gameplay has a similar issue. Older games than those, are completely seperate from the way games control nowadays, where as games from 2000-2010 mostly just play like games we have now.. just worse.\n\nPiss filter made sense thematically for a few of the games that era (GTA4, MW2). \n\nOtherwise it generally sucked\n\nNeed for Speed Most Wanted was the OG piss filter.\n\nNFS Most Wanted too\n\nThis paired with most genres being dumbed down to the barest minimum due to the struggles with HD transition made that generation so damn painful. It was also the first 7 year gen too, for max suffering.\n\nGames having a particular color vibe is fine but when it seemed like every other game had the same filter, it got incredibly old extremely quickly.\n\nI hated that shit\n\nI don't. same for the stupid ass bloom that was everywhere to hide zones loading or low resolution textures\n\nI miss the games themselves that used to come out during that time. Even the titles that disappointed me back then, now feel great to play.\n\nAh yes, the piss filter. I miss them too to be honest, they had a charm to them. Waiting for that Resident Evil 5 remake and I am hoping they give the option of applying that filter\n\nThey should call it last-gen filter. \n\nMexico filter\n\nI don't miss that at all 😀\n\nAlso Far Cry 2. The only game IMO you must put the reshade\n\nWhy did they do this though lol\n\nI don’t need colors in MY games\n\nResident Evil 5's *kinda* worked for the city section, it made everything feel sickly and close, without it the world is too bright. Then you go to bongo-bongo village and shoot locals living in mud huts with spears, so it was probably just a happy accident."

    "all_comment_text": "Plays games to escape reality\n\nPlays as self\n\nNot really, those game characters are borderline handsome and have some kind of skills.\n\na very particular set of skills, Skills that they have acquired over a very long career. Skills that make them a nightmare for people like you\n\nI don’t know who you are. I don’t know what you want. If you’re looking for ransom, i can tell you i don’t have reddit gold. But what i do have is an upvote.\n\nI will look for you.\n\nI will find you.\n\nAnd I will upvote you.\n\nIt was a particularly dark night\nIt was snowing softly\nAs I sat next to the window, glancing at my phone and sipping on coffee, that's when I realized that night would be a long one. That's when I knew I was going to have to upvote them all, one by one, until the last comment.\n\nGood luck\n\nBut it's yourself in a world you control! It's yourself as god!\n\nIf only.\n\nI wish I was Solid Snake.\n\nmy only knowledge of that game is when my roommate played and I'd hear this voice repeating \"Hurt me more!\" like ... over and over and over.  \n\nngl -- it was a lukewarm selling point.\n\nThe bosses are legendarily unhinged, but usually not like that. A more famous example is when it read your memory card and pretended it was reading your mind.\n\nYou both could be describing bosses from the same game, MGS1. Psycho-Mantis reads your memory card and controller inputs. The Cyber-ninja snake fights wants to get roughed up by snake to help reclaim his humanity.\n\nYou want to die of old age at like, 40?\n\nThat's why so many movies have little characterization and then a nearly immortal characters, as a power fantasy. Just saw John wick for the first time and lol it was entertaining but also fucked up if you think about culturally why it's so big\n\nTo be fair, the John Wick franchise is one of those franchises that is way off the rails and proudly so. They cherish and flaunt their extremism with so much pride that it becomes their identity. They know they are bonkers crazy but they wouldn't be them without that element. It's almost like a type of camp/cheese. Badass camp. John Wick and the Fast and the Furious franchises come to mind. They just don't give a F.\n\nThe self-aware scene in Fast X I think it was where the one character is like \"are we superheroes?\" is the single funniest scene in any action movie in my book.\n\nFan of the OG movies here, I honestly stopped watching when it felt like they were superheroes rather than street racers, maybe the 5th movie? The abrupt change in movie direction was honestly disappointing, but understandable given the direction content have gone over the past 10 years.\n\nI went and watched the clip and honestly the self-awareness is at least refreshing given the absurd tone-shift the movies took when The Rock came on.\n\nIf John Wick being big is fucked up imagine GTA lol\n\nBut I don't see an issue personally, given how far from reality they are\n\nThey just like us, frfr\n\nFalse...I'm not middle aged yet!\n\nThat's what all middle aged men say\n\nWell average for a male in the us is 74.8.  So middle age is 37.2. So you may be closer then you expect\n\nI turned 37 in sept. 😔\n\nWhat games are you playing now?\n\nRoblox, it technically gets around the restraining orders\n\nMax Payne was peak, lost his wife, lost his kid and lost his mind. Remake is currently in the works.\n\n[deleted]\n\nThey called it 'art style', a  cel-shaded  dance of shadows and light.  But  the truth  was a  bullet  ripping through the  night, a  fugue  of  blood  and  broken dreams. Each  word  a  hammer  blow,  pounding  on the  door  of  madness.  And the mechanics, oh, the sweet  mechanics...  bullet-time ballet,  a  symphony of pain.  It was a  ride, alright. A one-way ticket to  hell. But  sometimes,  hell  is the only place you can find  redemption.\n\nMax Payne was a fine line between being over the top noir and being a perfect gritty serious noir story. And it somehow worked\n\nThe baby crib scene was just one of those memorable gaming moments for me\n\nTranslated from the original Finnish:\n\n\"Welcome to Remedy, we're so happy to have you on board as a 3D modeller.\"\n\n\"Happy to be here, so excited to work on this game. What's my first job?\"\n\n\"Model a dead baby.\"\n\n\"Sure.\"\n\nYou're fucking hired\n\nBro you coooooooooooooked\n\nExcept that invisible platform maze with the incessant baby crying. Just put a bullet in me already.\n\nJFC, that baby scream when you fell was nightmare fuel.\n\ndream sequences were better in the second game. Hell, everything was better in the second game.\n\nExcept for the face.  \nSam Lake is the only true Max Payne\n\nAlso in Alan Wake 2, Sam Lake's face AND Max Payne's voice actor was Alex Casey. I wonder if Max Payne is part of the connected universe.\n\nHowever I just searched again and saw the voice actor passed away last year :( RIP James McCaffrey\n\nIf Remedy would own Max Payne - IP, he'd definitely be part of the connected universe.\n\nAlex Casey is the closest they can go for.\n\nAdd horror and a dream if you must, but please don't cram platforming in a game not really meant for it\n\nI thought that platforming was fine, the slow-mo helped a lot with control and positioning IMO.\n\nPlaying that in the middle of the night, in a dark basement, with headphones on while stoned made for one hell of an experience. I really fucking loved that game.\n\nRIP James McCaffrey. Hopefully they keep his voice lines\n\nSo I never played the Max Payne games due to being to young when they released, but I did play Control. And holy fuck James is awesome in that. Absolutely nails the hardboiled and paranoid leader of a top secret intelligence agency. Dude was made for those kinds of roles.\n\nYou're missing out.\n\nHis character in the new Alan Wake game is essentially a nod to Max Payne as well.\n\nIt’s not a nod, it’s literally him. If Remedy still owned all the rights to the character, his name would be Max Payne in Alan Wake\n\nOh shit, I really need to play AW2\n\nWhat? Rip? What?\n\nDude this is how I'm finding out he died?! Fuck me\n\nIt's his 1 year anniversary today.\n\ngod gone so young\n\nCancer. RIP.\n\nI’m definitely interested in what they are going to do there, like I assume they are trying to expand the games somewhat so it would seem hard not to add additional dialog but would it be weird to have 2 different voice actors? (Not that Remedy has ever shy’d away from weird)\n\nAlan Wake scratches a similar itch, which makes sense because the same writer created both characters.\n\nMax Payne is practically in Alan Wake 2. Alan Wake would probably have been the author of Max Payne novels instead of Alex Casey(one of the names they originally toyed with for MP) if Remedy had the rights instead of Rockstar.\n\nI loved 1 and 2, I felt like MP3 made the bullet time weaker and the weapons less effective.\n\n\nI just loved how in 1/2 you don't need anything but a handgun if you use bullet time.  It felt so badass walking around with a deagle doming bad guys.\n\n3 wasn't made by Remedy\n\nYakuza went from depressed middle-aged protagonist to enthusiastically positive middle-aged protagonist\n\nBut don't worry, Adachi and Nanba bring enough of that disgruntled attitude to keep things from getting TOO sunshine-and-rainbows\n\nWell, sort-of. One could argue Ichiban seems to cope with his depression by masking, disassociating and hallucinating that the world around him is a JRPG from his childhood.\n\nI'd love to see a LAD game that views Ichiban from outside his own viewpoint. Hallucinating ex con with a barbed wire baseball bat going after the leader of Japan probably looks different from a bystanders point of view.\n\nI think he's just upbeat. He sees the best in people which probably helps.\n\nKind of, but at the same time, Ichiban is still a ridiculously upbeat goofball even when he isn't hallucinating. Hell, one of my favorite things in LAD8 was just wandering around going \"Hello! Hi there! Aloha!\" at everyone.\n\nMore games should have a dedicated \"Hi there!\" button.\n\n(Then again, considering that Kiryu also starts hallucinating when he takes control of the party in Ijincho, maybe there's just something *very* funky in Yokohama's water.)\n\nI only played the first I feel I need to step up.\n\nWhat about the protag from Disco Elysium? He's not only depressed, but also an amnesiac and an alcoholic!\n\nNah, that guy's a superstar!\n\nYeah!!\n\nHARDCORE TO THE MEGA\n\nBut is it *really?*\n\nKim, am I having a stroke?\n\nAnd a Cop of the Apocalypse.\n\nI get stupidly excited hearing people talk about DE.\n\nBeen like a 6 months since I last played, and I still can’t stop thinking about it\n\n&gt;ELECTROCHEMISTRY [Easy: Success] - That's right, you need *more*. 6 months is too long, one play-through is too few. Start it up again. Just a little taste...\n\n&gt;RHETORIC - Even *I* can't argue with that.\n\nI can hear the voice. *That voice*. \n\nIf you want the vibes again, the soundtrack is available on most streaming services. Band is Sea Power. The 3 cuts of Whirling in Rags theme are fantastic\n\nDude I know, I also played it 6 months ago, and it might be the best game I've ever played.  I have been annoyingly shilling it to my friends, who still haven't played it.  I'll never stop being an annoying fucker about it though.\n\n**Harry Du Bois hits way too close to home**\n\n\"I AM THE COP OF THE APOCALYPSE\"\n\nHobo cop?\n\nFuck it, hobo cop!\n\nHard cop\n\nSorry cop\n\nI think you mean Firewalker\n\nTequila Sunset actually!\n\nI'm pretty sure it was Raphaël Ambrosius Costeau\n\nthat's it. That's the last one because you cannot top this. it is cool. dignified. most importantly, disco.\n\nI AM THE ICE BREAKER\n\n&gt;RHETORIC [Easy: Success] - Much can be said of the effectiveness of a single character to provoke thought.\n\n&gt;SHIVERS [Hard: Success] - Keys clatter in some distant room, the musings and thoughts of other minds reverberating outward – wrangled together and poured into one singular magnum opus. There, in the depths of written words echo sentiments and feelings all too familiar. \n\n&gt;VOLITION - *Don't* call her.\n\nOh, I'm fucking calling her.\n\n&gt;AUTHORITY [Medium: Success] - Asserting control is a certainty of success. The phone is your tool, it's buttons bend to your will. It cannot stop you.\n\n&gt;VOLITION [Hard: Failure] - I did try to warn you.\n\n&gt;ENDURANCE [Impossible: Failure] - Is there *supposed* to be a tightening sensation in your throat and chest? That's probably normal.\n\n&gt;#*DAMAGED HEALTH -1*\n\nFuck it I’m dialing her number.\n\nAn ocean of static washes over you, drowning out the world. \n\n*calling...*\n\nYou try to focus on the noise, trying to hear something, anything.\n\n*still calling...*\n\nYou chest tightens, a bead of sweat slids down your spine.\n\n*calling still...*\n\nThe phone begins to blur, then splits in two.\n\nVolition \\[Medium: Success\\]: You don't have to force it. You can leave. Just hang up.\n\n**Hang Up: Volition \\[Impossible: 18\\]: Base 5, Modifiers: \\[Still calling -10\\], Chance of success 3%**\n\nHang up.\n\n**\\[o\\] \\[o\\]** *, Snake eyes*\n\nThe ocean of static floods your mind, filling every corners with its relentless white screaming.\n\n*calling...*\n\n*calling...*\n\n\n\n*calling...*\n\n\n\n*calling...*\n\n\n\n*calling...*\n\n\n\n*calling...*\n\n\n\n*calling...*\n\n\n\n*calling...*\n\n\n\n*calling...*\n\nIf as a man you've ever been through an extremely painful break up, this game shoots you right in the wound.\n\nAnd then jams a finger into it and starts moving it around in there.\n\nAs a recovering alcoholic I still can't get through the game. Way too close indeed.\n\nYou doing ok?\n\n*Calling...*\n\n*Calling...*\n\n*Calling...*\n\n*Still calling...*\n\nHe hit so close to home that the freaking intro made me weep into my hands (don't laugh at me)\n\n&gt;INLAND EMPIRE - There is yet still more that exists within such a character, beyond what can be seen.\n\n&gt;ELECTROCHEMISTRY [Trivial: Success] - Exactly. 'Alcoholic' barely scratches the surface. \n\n&gt;PHYSICAL INSTRUMENT [Medium: Failure] - Not to mention the most important thing: *undeniable peak fitness*.\n\n&gt;LOGIC - You're pretty sure it's *very* deniable.\n\nIs this in game dialogue? I’m assuming it is because it’s fantastic lol.\n\n&gt;ENCYCLOPAEDIA [Easy: Success] - You are unaware of any such dialogue that matches this within the game. \n\n&gt;LOGIC - Though similar in nature, and holding to the same structure, it appears instead to be an imitation of sorts. \n\n&gt;DRAMA [Trivial: Success] - Imitation, the purest form of flattery.\n\n&gt;SAVOIR FAIRE - Derivative, but still *cool*.\n\nare you the guy that got fired from ZA/UM\n\nNo, just fond of their writing style and of DE in general. That, and I just replayed it recently so it's stuck in my mind haha.\n\nFor real, I'm jealous. I tried writing this same style at first but scrapped the post because I didn't feel it carried well. You nailed it.\n\nThanks! They did a really great job of keeping each different stat distinctive with the dialogue when making it. It must've been hard to really dial in to each one for the quantity of dialogue in the game. Making something relatively vague or broad like 'endurance' into a clearly detailed character of sorts with its own distinct voice is impressive. \n\nEvery now and then I see some comment on this site referring to DE and I can't help myself but try and recreate a bit of that as best I can for shits and giggles. Plus it kind of adds an extra layer of appreciation to the game for me, seeing it from that angle.\n\nGod damn it dude. Subscribe. Subscribe subscribe subscribe. This writing style really fires my monkey brain synapses\n\n&gt;CONCEPTUALIZATION [Medium: Success] - You get it. You aren't entirely sure what *it* is, but you *are* certain that you get it. \n\n&gt;ELECTROCHEMISTRY - The details don't really matter, you know that much – just as long as you keep getting that fix and those synapses keep firing.\n\nOmg u have to play it if you haven’t\n\nHe's also an amnesiac\n\nMr. Evrart is helping me find my gun.\n\nHarrier Du Bois is the paragon of this archetype\n\nLegitimately brilliant to drop people into an established world as an amnesiac. You are as much that character as you could possibly be, every action you take is in character, the character of a man out of his mind and disconnected from the world around him.\n\nI decided to play it careful and didn't tell Lena that i don't remember jack shit, so I went through most of the game not even aware of the crazy shit like Pale. Thought isolas was fancy way to call continents/islands.\n\nFr how OP didn't include Harry and Arthur Morgan? Two middle-aged depressed GOATs\n\ncraniometric perfection!\n\nMy first playthrough of Disco Elysium ended within the first hour when I was insulted by a child bully, failed a saving throw, and died from painful embarrassment.* \n\nDidn't know the build I picked (one of the default builds, mind-you, not custom) only had 1 \"hit point\" (forget what it's called in game).\n\nAbsolutely one of my favorite games of all time.\n\n*Now that I think about it, it was either the bully's insult, or attempting to withstand the scent of a corpse.  Either way, one failed roll and my game was over.\n\nWild that Cuno is just outside your hotel room, and it genuinely takes an hour of gameplay to get that far into the game, isn't it?\n\nKid is *vicious.*\n\nHIS BODY BETRAYS HIS DEGENERACY.\n\nwe prefer to just be called 'middle-aged men'. we know we're depressed.\n\nYes, adding the \"depressed\" bit is redundant.\n\n# ARTHUUUR\n\nYeah I was wondering where he was in this picture… cmon dutch\n\nArthur is canonically like 35 \n\nmiddle aged shrinkflation is real :(\n\nNiko's in OP's collage and he's only *30*.\n\nSoon we're going to be referring to college students as 'middle aged'.\n\nYes, but he was Serbian, that's like 47 in \"western years\"\n\nHe’s 36 but that’s about the equivalent of a modern 50 year old with the lifestyle of 1899\n\nGod I miss Niko Bellic.\n\nI hate that he happened before GTA characters got the fame and support they deserved.\n\nHis story was really good too.\n\nGTA 4 and Niko Bellic holds up better today than GTA5 imo. Liberty City feels much more like an actual city than GTA5.\n\nGTA 4 in general feels like they made each element the best they could up until the point they were running out of time (and froze some things prior to fully fleshing them out) and had to figure out how to make a GTA game out of what they had which is probably a really inefficient way to make a game but it really meant there was a bunch of excess detail to absorb and be part of.\n\nGTA 5 felt like they made it the other way around - This is a GTA game, we need this here, this here, this here, fill the space in-between, stick a tunnel in there, a jump here, etc. far more efficient and they went to great lengths to make a good, fleshed out GTA game but if the creators thought it was superfluous or excessive to the goal of a creating a GTA game it just didn't get made in the first place.\n\nYeah, I'm like 99%+ sure I saw an interview somewhere about how they built Liberty City and fleshed out its cast first, and then started making the actual GTA IV game around/within the world they'd created.\n\nThis also allowed it to have ridiculously consistent internal lore. Little things like the same popular actors being name-dropped by different people. Or a character featured in an in-game TV show showing up in the background of a game cutscene. Things like that. They put a LOT of work into making LC feel like a real place.\n\n&gt;  Liberty City feels much more like an actual city than GTA5.\n\nI mean that's the nature of LA vs NYC in general\n\n&gt;I hate that he happened before GTA characters got the fame and support they deserved.\n\n\nWhat about CJ? To this day he's one of the most famous GTA characters ever, arguably the most famous since the ps2 was the most sold console ever and GTA: SA was one of the most popular titles for that console\n\nSome people don’t know the pain of watching your gang break up and Ballas taking over your turf.\n\nCan someone tell me title of these games please?\n\nSolid Snake from Metal Gear Solid IV Guns of the Patriots (you can't play that masterpiece without a PS3 currently)\n\nMax Payne from the Max Payne Franchise (the image is from Max Payne 3 wich has a big gap with the other 2 games in graphics if you're into that sort of thing)\n\nNiko Belic from GTAIV \n\nand Joel from The Last of Us (the image is from the Remake) \n\n\nthey're all great characters and worth your time you can't go wrong there\n\nThe Joel pic is actually from part 2. Most bittersweet scene too\n\nJames from Silent Hill 2 may fit in this club.\n\nhe's like 29 years old\n\nNico Bellic is in his 20s as well, but he looks older.\n\nI'm 36 and I think James in the remake looks older than me.\n\njames looks like he's divorced and has two kids\n\nNiko was 26 years old in GTA IV. For a 10-year-old, 26 might seem like middle age, but for me, 26 is the age of a young adult, not a middle-aged man.\n\nHe's 30 but yeah. A decade spent fighting in 90s former Yugoslavia will do that to you.\n\nNo he was 30\n\nHe was born in 1978, so you are right.  Still, 30 is still young.\n\nSpoken like someone who isn't 40 yet.\n\nI'm with you, 30's is still young, I swear!\n\nWouldn't someone who is 40+ be more inclined than someone still in their 30s to think 30 is young?\n\nhe was fucking 30? jesus, serbia did a number on him.\n\nWhat eastern europe does to a mf\n\nWhat eastern europe does to a mfers hairline\n\nThat's wild. He looks at least 40.\n\nI mean, eastern European living through war crimes and poverty.........that helps.\n\nDude looks and talks older then he is \n\nLife does that to you\n\nWar ages people.\n\nAs a 27yo, it's nice to hear someone refer to people around my age as young for once.\n\nInternally it feels like I'm three kids in a trench coat pretending to be a grown-up, haha.\n\nWhen do you start feeling like a real adult?\n\nI am 44, and I still don't feel like an adult.  For me, that is good; I like to keep an open mind and a young spirit.\n\nProud of you. I'm 35. I'm same way haha\n\nThat's a rough 26\n\nthat's just the eastern european look.\n\nHe only needs a super-hot girlfriend to complete the Eastern European man look.\n\nDisco Elysium is the king of this genre.\n\nThen may I recommend Jim Raynor in Starcraft 2, Wings of Liberty.\n\nNo Harry from DE?\n\nThe most depressed apologetic sad boy.\n\nHe is sorry for not being pictured here\n\n&gt;ENCYCLOPAEDIA [Trivial: Success] - You can think of no other character that better suits the description of \"depressed middle aged man\".\n\n&gt;LOGIC - 'Depressed' may be an understatement.\n\nas i was scrolling briefly thought this was a r/discoelysium post 😅\n\nSnake was NOT middle-aged in MGS4. He had fully aged into an OLD man, 'cos of his programmed genes. He's biologically older than all the other three in the pic, and by a lot.\n\nHis body might be much older, but he's still only lived 42 years. He was a middle aged man (trapped in an old man's body).\n\nBruce Wayne from the Asylum quadrilogy.\n\nThat dude has some serious mid life crisis issues\n\nI live it.  So I don’t mind playing characters that aren’t like me.\n\nSo much for escapist power fantasies\n\ni think games like the last of us are still a power fantasy lol. i mean sure it's a sad narrative, but you can straight up go through the whole game punching a world of infected zombies to death, that's pretty power fantasy to me haha\n\nwell you won't find any depressed middle aged women as game protagonists, so i think this is your only option lol\n\nNiko Bellic is not middle aged. He’s like mid to late twenties.\n\nApparently he’s supposed to be 30 at the time of GTA4\n\nBut emotionally he’s in his late 50s so I’d still count him\n\nHe's eastern European so that tracks.\n\nShould've gone with Michael from 5\n\n- Middle aged\n- Depressed\n- GTA protagonist\n\nit was right there, OP!\n\nIf he dies at 60, that’s *middle* age.\n\nHe's 30 in gta4. Granted not middle aged, but he looks old as fuck.\n\nWhat war did to a mf.\n\nThe Evil Within, anyone?\n\nLove this game. Sebastian is underrated\n\nAdd Adam Jensen\n\nAdd to that:\n\n\nYakuza/Like a Dragon Series true buffet of Variety of Depressed Middle Aged Men\n\n\nFinal Fantasy XVI\n\n\n Alan Wake\n\n\nMax Payne\n\n\nAssassin's Creed Revelations \n\n\nGod of War (Norse Sequels. Greek games are Angry Middle Aged Man)\n\nBecause game developers are depressed middle-aged men.\n\nNot quite as fun to BE one however.\n\nI play every game as a depressed middle aged man, they help me become a depressed middle aged man who sucks at games.\n\nThis is why I don't care about if a game has a woman that isn't some barely 18 porn star. most games I've played I have had to empathize with some ugly old man who makes choices that I wouldn't.\n\nYakuza is suspiciously absent from this post\n\nHeavy Rain tho... \"Jaaaaason! Jason?'\n\nKiryu kazuma fits this description perfectly.\n\nMGS4 and Max Payne 3 were solid 10s.\n\nMax Payne 3 so underrated, one of the best Rockstar games ever made, GTA IV is in another level too.\n\nIt's because most of the audience can relate lol"

What a cool comment to come across\n\nAgree, since I’m within 30 mins from finishing the first book… I LOVE miller!\n\nI started watching recently as well. Think I binged the first three seasons in a couple weeks. Halfway through four now. What a great show.\n\nIf you go to fast into the room, the room will eat you.\n\nThat part is absolutely amazing!\n\nLol I finished watching this show just a few weeks ago. Good stuff.\n\nNow go read the books!\n\nits nice how the show isn't 100% the same as the books, just a couple small and some larger differences between them\n\nThe writers were really smart about the adaptation.\n\nThe book is more brainy, a bit stoic and detail heavy because those things work very well in books.\n\nBut the show, it is TV, so they made the characters more emotionally intense and gave more focus to moments with great visuals.\n\nThey really understood the strengths and necessities of storytelling in different medias.\n\nThe one and only complaint i have about the Expanse and its adaptation is it has set the bar so damn high for other adaptations.\n\nMostly small, to be honest, apart from the whole Alex fiasco. \n\nI love it when a show is made by the same people.\n\nShow Drummer is an amalgamation of several book characters.\n\nAlso, Cara Gee is a goddess.\n\nThe Expanse for anyone confused, watch it!\n\nI want an open world almost like the new star wars but for The Expanse!\n\nThe Dark Souls route is \"Does not open from this side\"\n\nand you then proceed to go in a completely different direction, progress normally for a couple of hours, then open a door and be like \"oh wow it's the other side of that one door I was trying to get into hours ago!\"\n\nWhen I’m lost or unsure in FS games I’ll often think to myself “I think I should go this way so I’m gonna do the opposite” and it almost never fails.\n\n[deleted]\n\n“Special paths and secrets everywhere” is what happens when devs don’t rush things and actually have enough time to put some love in to a game.\n\n“Fuck that shit, we need this title out by next month!”\n\nQuick put something behind a paywall! Uh I mean waterfall WATERFALL!!!\n\nI almost think there's an element of \"I payed for this, the player will darn well see it.\"\n\nI remember reading a Bioshock Infinite review a long time ago where the reviewer walked around the lighthouse to a corner and found some coins to pick up, and didn't like it because they thought they would now constantly be distracted finding hidden stuff maybe.\n\nI saw this a very very long time ago, don't think I can find it again.\n\nExcept when you use that logic but end up accidentally going in the right direction\n\nI might never forget the feeling I had when I went on an elevator and it led me back to Firelink Shrine in DS1 for the first time.\n\nWhat a great moment.\n\nMe in Cathedral of the Deep when DS3 first came out. Lol\n\nMe in Firelink Shrink for several hours the first time I played. Took me ages to figure out what the correct/easy path out was.\n\nI miss when this was the entire design of the game. :(\n\nor \"Locked by some contraption\"\n\nIt's pretty egregious when the door has bars wide enough you can reach through lol.\n\nOr a castle gate that you can literally squeeze your body through.\n\nI wouldn't want to risk getting stuck and being vulnerable to my step-undead/tarnished/hunter\n\nWhat are you doing step-Capra demon!?\n\nTry tongue but hole.\n\nOh I thought of it as “Better look around this building before entering to look for something hidden.”\n\nI thought of this and: better make sure everything out there is dead before going in, just in case it follows me inside and ganks me.\n\nYou don't have the right, O you don't have the right\n\nTherefore you don't have the right, O you don't have the right\n\nLater: “a heavy door has opened” but not till you’ve completely forgotten where that door is\n\nDark Souls level design is pretty much just:\n\nGiant door in the middle of the level: leads to maybe a bit of titanite if you’re lucky\n\nRandom path in an alley that leads to the boss and like 16 different npc questlines\n\ndam roof bells friendly subtract six sugar water stupendous growth\n\nWukong invisible walls are a nightmare. Just put a minimap so I know where I can and where I cant go. Map navigaton is terribile.\n\nDefinitely my biggest complaint about the game. The level design/navigation seems to be actively against the player.\n\nThere’s no Level design, there’s a map with objects and enemies on it. The rest is invisible walls.\n\nThis is maybe one of the most helpful bits I've seen in considering whether or not to buy this game.  I'm a huge fromsoft fan,  but I tend to bounce off games that are supposed to be similar. But I'm always tempted.\n\nAnother Crabs Treasure was a nice detour before the Elden Ring DLC\n\nSounds compelling!\n\nIt’s a lovely game. Filled to the brim with great puns and specific fromsoft references and the game plays surprisingly well and has some interesting mechanics.\n\nIt also helps a ton to have reasonable scope. You can load up a smaller world or have a sparce huge plain but it seems like companies prefer number two\n\nI wanted to play this game ever since I saw the “time for crab!” tagline in the trailer\n\nAggroCrab, the developer, releases youtube shorts about cool stuff in the game thats non-spoilery, check it out!\n\nIf level design is your thing and the main reason you enjoy a game, then Wukong is absolutely atrocious and not the game for you.\n\nBut the boss battles and combat systems are really something special. \n\nIt's a 7/10 game for sure but I'd 100% still recommend it.\n\nThis is helpful.  I'll probably try it at some point.\n\nThe combat makes it worth it, as a fromsoft vet this was a fun boss rush type of game.\n\nIt’s crazy they way it dropped and it seemed like everybody was proclaiming it as a perfect game, this is the first I’m hearing about this\n\nthat is often the case in the \"honeymoon phase\" of high profile games, hell even Starfield got some praise in the beginning.\n\nYeah, I can think of a few games that aged like milk just in the last year or two.\n\nYeah no. Dont let the hype get to u. Its a good game but way way way far from perfect\n\nWukong is way closer to God of War than it is to a Soulslike. Less emphasis on environment and punishing enemies and more on big setpieces and lots of exciting combat options. It's great in its own right.\n\nTechnically, “there’s a map with objects and enemies on it” describes the majority of games.\n\nWas just playing Alien Isolation, I really noticed the level design there. The game subtlely directs you to the next objective through lights, colours and placement. It's really smart and flows really nicely.\n\nI think it was halflife or halflife 2 that came with some commentary that open my eyes to this, and now I can't unsee when I play games.\n\nYes! I'm literally watching a playthrough and it's amazing what they did. Both games are good but Half-life 2 is in a world of its own for how good it does direction.\n\nI love this comment. I tried to play it like 3 years ago, for the first while it was exactly like you said. Then I got to a point where I could **not** figure out wtf to do. I spent an hour or more spread over a couple different sessions and eventually just gave up lmao \n\nWas probably my fault, especially judging from your comment, or I somehow broke my save. Not sure\n\nI am struggling through it myself, don't really play games like this.\n\n[deleted]\n\nTotally hear what you’re saying and I pretty much agree. However, of my 35 years playing video games, this is literally the first game where the invisible walls actually bother me.\n\nBecause the devs for some reason hates minimap\n\n100% would improve the game substantially. Modders will once again have to do the game a favor\n\nApparently there is a mini map I saw another thread on it but the op never linked where they got it from\n\nThe lack of a map is killing me. I get so confused trying to navigate some of these areas, especially the ones that loop back around on themselves.\n\nI agree. I thought chapter 1 was okay, then I entered chapter 2 and realized that map design and pathing was probably not the best thing about this game.\n\n\"Okay, Got to the village gate. Oh that was easy, just deflect arrows and power through. Oh, only opens from the other side? Okay, guess I'll go around. WTF is the power level of these explosive enemies?! Guess I'll use cloud step and sneak around. Boss kicked my ass so I guess I'll go left instead and explore. Okay made it to the other side of the gate, and defeated a decently fun boss. Found an npc, so thats Cool. Got two shot from a crossbow guy because he was covered in blue flames. Finally opened the ficking gate, but now what?! What was that for?! It's not even a shortcut to the actual boss and i got everything that was important on the way here!\"\n\nIt's actually a shortcut from the bonfire to an optional boss you can unlock through an incredibly esoteric questline. The one at the bottom of the well next to the shrine where the horse guy is tied up.\n\nYeah that quest line pissed me off. Another example of how a map could have been a nice thing to add with some map markers.\n\nI thought it was just me. I found myself getting lost and often felt misled by the environment design as to where to go\n\nYeah the Level design is awful. Also that Yellowbrow phase 2 is infuriating.\n\nI feel like Wukong really shows the importance of good level design.\n\nYou're forgetting Zelda, where you rotate the room and make it come to you.\n\nPortal has entered the chat\n\nAnd left the chat\n\nAnd reentered the chat\n\nAnd left again\n\nWe’re looping…\n\nOk I understand the Zelda reference, but what’s with the original post? I’m not really sure what the image means. Why would the way you enter buildings differ in these games?\n\n* Dark Souls you search for secrets first, then enter the room (which likely contains a trap and/or boss).\n\n* God of War you stroll up confidently ready to wreck ass.\n\n* Last of Us you only get so close before sneaking, as stealth is important.\n\n* And Wukong has bad geometry and invisible walls everywhere.\n\nI didn't know about the invisible walls in Wukong. The arrows on the graphic made me picture some kind of forced \"knight in chess\" movement style.\n\nNot sure on dark souls - maybe looking for secrets?\n\nGod of war. - action game. Run right in. No secret no stealth.\n\nTlou- sneak in. Go to the first but if cover. Then peek in. Make way inside after seeing if safe. Or maybe it means you have to push that block to the entrance to get in /over an obstacle. \n\nWukong - haven't played but invisible walls sound like a fairly common issue.\n\n&gt; Not sure on dark souls - maybe looking for secrets?\n\nAnd also hidden enemies that might surprise you after you enter the room.\n\nNow show the line making 50 stops to inspect every rock and bush *outside* of the room before going to the door, for RPG players.\n\ndeus ex human revolution, they had this office with like 100 desks to check, one of them had a praxis in it smh\n\nYou triggered memories of me needing to open every drawer in Shenmue...😖\n\nAnd every drawer opening is accompanied by:\n\n*Black Screen.*\n\n30-second long unskippable cutscene of Ryo going \"Hmm. A drawer.\" Then bending down slower than an arthritic geriatric to open it and stand back up.\n\n*Another Black Screen.*\n\n-Closeup of the drawer contents for 5 whole seconds before control is given back to you.\n\nAnd repeat in inverse order for closing the drawer. Every. Time.\n\n😩 I mean... the forklift job was kinda fun 🙄\n\nI got a job as a forklift operator because of this game.\n\nAnd that's the perfect system. Find that person that just fucking loves to do X thing and pay him a great wage to do X thing, passionately.\n\nThey really stepped it up in [Shenmue 3](https://youtu.be/f7SVY9CyBBc?si=WRf2xOmnvWznDzOp&amp;t=486)\n\nThen, every box in the draw\n\nThen spend the coin on getting a little figure from the arcade machine.\n\nNozomi?\n\nI loved walking through the newspaper reporters' office and finding Praxis, hand grenades, and shotgun ammo. \n\nAnd then you quietly take out the SWAT guy who just finished telling his team how dangerous you are, and he's got three revolver bullets on him. He's telling everyone how deadly you are, and he hasn't bothered to even reload his gun since last time.\n\n\"sir, we need to stop the terrorist\"\n\n\"Wait, I need to know every angle of this office drama. Surely there is more email that explain why Brandon rat Emily out\"\n\nRIP Deus Ex. They really borked up that franchise\n\nHR/MD were good for a while but goodness the endings suck\n\niirc MD just ends on what seems like a midgame side quest lmao\n\nIt's well known that they cut the entire end of the game [MD] because they ran out of budget but were confident it would do well enough so they could finish the story in a sequel.\n\nExactly. I really like HR enough to play through multiple times for all the endings.\n\nMD has a huge ass cliffhanger and no reference to the decisions you’ve made so you kinda get the same ending regardless of how you played it. Pretty much a total cop out they were supposed to smooth things out with the DLC that got canceled then they released unrelated content and it’s basically a dead franchise\n\nMD really felt like an unfinished game. It's kind of disgusting how you can just have it \"end\" like that.\n\nMaybe they’d have more budget if they cut out that shitty tacked on multiplayer mode\n\nAnd micro trans and seasonal junk\n\nSandra: \"oh my god.....daddy!\"  \nJC: \"What a shame\"   \n\\*after shooting him in the face in front of his daughter\\*\n\nThe deadpan line delivering makes him my favorite character\n\n'How's the wine??'\n\n'Great if you like cat piss'\n\n'Never tried it.'\n\nI was so ready to love Ender Lilies but playing it was uh…\n\nYou know how in most games, random breakable boxes will have like, money, or maybe health potions or something insignificant but still useful?\n\nWell in Ender Lillies that’s where they hide your permanent health upgrades. \n\nSo if you don’t obsessively break everything in the game you gimp yourself. It doesn’t make exploration feel rewarding, it makes it feel tedious and mandatory.\n\nEnder Lilies has the room change colour on the map if you find all the secrets in it though so you're really only searching one room if you miss something. Most of the health bead things were pretty easy to find imo and only give you like 5hp anyway..\n\nIt thought it was an amazing game. Incredible soundtrack too. I can't wait for Ender Magnolia.\n\nIt does show which rooms have items in them on the map so it's really not that bad.\n\nI think that's the dark souls route\n\nYes\nMe hitting every random wall on the small chance it's an illusion\n\nMy first memories of doing this behavior are from the original Zelda. Flaming every single god damn plant in the game with the candle in hopes of finding something.\n\nThen falling over in glee when a door is actually found after all those tries making it worth it.\n\nDon’t forget bombing every single god damn wall. ALL OF EM\n\nMy favorite is not going through the door because I want to find all the exploration paths and the door looks like the way to the next level. So I decided to go through the hidden rock passage first, but that ends up being the path to the next level and now I will never see what is in that room.\n\nslim zesty sulky chop shaggy spotted outgoing price cooperative rinse\n\nHey stop watching me game\n\nBaulders Crate 3\n\nWhy you gotta do me like that?\n\nI mean that's why Dark Souls line is circling around first.\n\nMe in fallout 4 hoarding everything i can hold:\n\n\"0/3 secrets found\" line from Heretic\n\nCyberpunk: find a camera on the network from a block away and kill everyone. Never go inside.\n\nOr run in, slice everyone's head off with a Katana and leave the room before the first body hits the floor.\n\nOr smack everyone in the face with Sir John Phallustiff.\n\nOr use your brain to make everybody shock themselves, go berserk, trigger their grenades, emit toxic fumes, and kill themselves all from the side of the road.\n\nLol i just mass AOE hack everyone for instakill dmg.\n\nMax level hacker builds are hilarious. From the outside, it just looks like I rolled up on my motorcycle, glared angrily at a gang, and they all died.\n\nPlaying through cyberpunk now, and it's hilarious how true this is.\n\nIf I *deign* to kill someone with my pistol or smart sniper they should feel honored, I can mostly just light everyone on fire with my mind.\n\nCyberpunk is one of the best examples of the devs just letting the player be ridiculously OP if you put in the effort. I myself go for more balanced builds, but it’s so fun seeing the absolute chaos players can achieve and the devs seem to encourage it rather than endlessly patching all the fun out of the game for the sake of “balance.”\n\nI love how the game just kind of lets you do it to.\n\nLike, it's OP as fuck, but itt actually lets you be that if you want to\n\nCyberpunk 2.0 is actually *nerfed* in regards to this, too. It used to be that you could Contagion an entire building in one go.\n\nFrom an entire block away, too.\n\nI think my V might be the adult version of Drew Barrymore in Firestarter 😂\n\nComments like this make me realize how bad I am at Cyberpunk. \n\nI unga'd all the bungas when I played.\n\nI think the gun play is really fun actually \n\nThats the fun way imo. There was no challenge in my hacker playthrough\n\nNetrunners when I turn off my wifi : 😔\n\nFake. Dark Souls would have you open the door from the inside. Everyone knows the door doesn't open from this side.\n\nYou don't have the right, you don't have the right!\nAnd furthermore, you don't have the right!\n\nWukong is really fun and looks gorgeous, but man does it suck to be constantly running into invisible walls.\n\nFrom what I’ve heard it’s mostly a series of boss fights with long winding corridors between them. Is that right?\n\nYep basically. Feels kind of like a boss rush at times.\n\nPeople keep spouting this but I don't really see it. It's only true for the first and 5th chapters, all the others have significant divergence in the paths you can explore.\n\nIt's very easy to get lost without a map which for some gamers is super rewarding because almost every direction has something rewarding, but frustrating for others because it's easy to get lost and difficult to keep track of which ways you've explored and which you haven't.\n\nyeah there's some divergence for sure with the secret areas and bosses. one  complaint other than the lack of a map I have exploring all the secret areas and bosses is the readability (?) of the terrain - many places that seem like openings to secret areas are just blocked off by invisible walls, which could've been better designed imo\n\nThe Red Dead version is walking around the cabin and getting distracted by a perfect pelt animal and then the line goes directly to the trapper and coming back hours later cause you got caught up in poker.\n\nRed Dead 1 players trying to fight the urge in their head to waste their money on high-stakes Blackwater poker\n\nTLOU2 is literally \"The Door Is Locked. Must Be Another Way Round\": The Game.\n\nYou’ll feel empty inside for two weeks after you get into the room\n\n[deleted]\n\nX com 2: two guys each side of the door. Demolitions behind cover looking right at the door. Two guys grapple to the roof to get height advantage through the skylight. Sniper way back in the bushes. Everyone concealed. Open the door and shoot grenades in. Everyone else overwatch ambush. Ensuing battle leaves the walls of the room half destroyed and mostly on fire.\n\nPlot twist, there was no one in the room. As soon as you open the door, aliens appears all around you, and start shooting. You lose your favorite character first.\n\nThen everybody misses their 99% shot, Codex breaks your weapons, Andromedon nades and poisons half your squad, and the mec drops and kills your snipers with rockets.\n\nThen you just save scum until it all goes your way.\n\nBut it never does. That’s baby, Xcom!\n\nyou forgot “ranger leeroy jenkins in, swords everyone to death”\n\nI have many fond memories of playing xcom multiplayer with friends, and jumping their units with stealthed sword rangers\n\nreaper is the most op talent in the game\n\nYour sniper got 87% chance of hitting the alien at the door. Still misses. Alien kills half your team.\n\n\"Your ranger is mind-controlled!\" ---- Shiiit\n\nHaving PTSD flashbacks from classic XCOM: Terror From The Deep right now.\n\nNot pictured: the item that was on that pillar on the east in Dark souls, as well as the 800 praised message that says \"Try left!\" Which you do, but there's nothing around the back side (fuckin' troll). \n\nThere is also an item south of the western pillar in a chest that you wouldn't have seen if you hadn't read the message since it's in a small patch of darkness and you didn't bring a light source. That's what it was trying to tell you originally, but you thought that meant \"around the back-side of the room\".\n\nThere's a ton of useless messages especially in Elden Ring\n\nThis is the only real main gripe I have with Wukong. They make the maps look so open, like you're able to traverse them but you're constantly stopped by invisible walls. It's been hard to discern what parts of the map you're able to walk within and what parts you can't at first glance\n\n[deleted]\n\nDoors and corners, kid.\n\nBeltalowda!\n\nthats where they get ya\n\nI just finished watching the show and am now listening to the audiobooks. Pleased to suddenly understand a lot more Internet references! Also, can't wait to find out what's in the last 3 books!\n\nCurrently playing TLOU part 2. As soon as I get into a room I'm checking all angles, listening, then rubbing the character against every surface while mashing triangle.\n\nI love how dangerous every fight in that game feels, I could get stuck in a hallway forever just trying to avoid clickers or clever enemies. And then you find a clutch bottle at just the right moment\n\nI do think TLOU2 has some of, if not the, best implementation of intelligent enemies that are both coordinated and unpredictable. It really enhances the tension of the game.\n\ni remember sneaking through a blacked out office building, crawling through a tiny hole in the wall, and looking back just cuz... paranoia?\n\nonly to see a stalker leaning down and *looking at me* through the hole i had just crawled through.\n\nshit my pants **and** nailed the most clutch headshot of my fucking life.\n\nMGSV walked so tlou2 could run\n\nMe in MGSV:  \n1. Enter area from side.  \n2. Stealth around for 10 minutes.  \n3. Get bored and kill everyone with rockets.\n\nThere's an auto-pick up in the accessibility options.\n\nYou forgot a boss after every arrow in Wukong though\n\nThats the fucking truth. Congrats on beating this boss! HERES ONE MORE!\n\nBABA IS YOU\nWALL IS NOT STOP\n\nFallout: quicksave because the game may crash. VATS the raider at the door. Crouch-walk while hugging the wall looting everything on the way. Trip a shotgun trap and almost die. The game crashes when you try to stimpak.\n\n~~dark souls~~ every rpg out there\n\nWrong, people explore in God of War even if it's for the most simple chest with little to no resources.\n\nThey even put a line of dialogue in Ragnarok mentioning how Kratos likes to take a detour to gather resources even if the main path is clear as day.\n\nExactly, exploration is the fun part of that game. If you go straight from room to room it is all over long cutscenes\n\nSkyrim: I immediately sprint 10 km away from the doorway and start looking for butterflies.\n\nMinecraft: Just dig through the wall\n\nJedi Fallen Order: 4D spaghetti\n\nRed Faction: Wherever you want\n\nBMW drivers now in the game xD\n\nNow figure out the floor pattern puzzle in Goldeneye 007 on the Egyptian level.\n\nAnd in Deep Rock Galactic we just follow our Driller player right through the wall.\n\nRock and Stone Brothers.\n\nIn fallout, you'd never make it into the room, even with a 100+ hour playthrough.\n\nNow do a Metal Gear entry.\n\nMissing the skyrim players that just immediately go the complete opposite direction and never actually finish.\n\nDarks souls gets on my nerves, “door does not open from this side”"

Haha, to be honest I might do one for my 38th.\n\nI'm 43 and that's dead in fallout years, lol.\n\nEdit: IMO living dead is still dead 🧟\n\nNot if you're a ghoul, it ain't.\n\n(I'm the same age God help our knees and back)\n\nGhouls in the games have visibly decayed noses and ears. As cartilage is also present in joints it stands to reason that all ghouls should have severe arthritis\n\nHaha!\n\nIt feels like we are all the same age sometimes, haha.\n\nIt does apart from my knees feel like they're dissolving in my 30's haha.\n\nI'll take one for my 53rd!!\n\nI’m stealing it for my 28th\n\nYou can buy the bobble heads from\nAmazon to stick on top.\n\nI just wanna know what perks I get for level 45. \n\nI'm hoping for 'painless knees' or 'insomnia immunity'\n\nI picked up the \"clicky knees\" trait during character creation. I don't even know why, it doesn't give me any good bonuses. \n\nSame, I thought it might unlock bionic knees later, but turns out that perk tree is just a dead end :(\n\nI put my few remaining points into 'cynicism' and 'political rage'. Gives you a -2 CHA bonus between 10pm and 6am\n\nSeriously regretting putting a bunch of points into 'fatigue' too.\n\nNeed the DLC to go past 30 though….\n\nLol same for my sigh 39th\n\nI'm hitting level 40 this year 😮‍💨😬\n\nThat's usualy my victory lap ingame where I start to snowball. Hope your life is like that too.\n\nYou probably have a bunch of cool perks now though\n\nLevel 60ish here. If you guys are complaining now just wait.\n\nSame here. Definitely.\n\nCake:  Congratulations on breaking your previous record of 36 years in hard core mode!\n\nYou'll need the DLC which raises the level cap.\n\nTried to put my 39th one up, but mods removed.. it was epic!\n\nI’d love to have one when I turn 70 next October!\n\nHappy birthday for October!\n\nWhat’s it like playing video games at that age? How long have you been playing them for?\n\nOh, I’ve been addicted to gaming since Pong was introduced! My three sons (42, 32, and 28) grew up playing video games with me, and all three turned out just fine! Now I’m a grandma to my 6-year-old grandson, and it’s great! Playing at my age is the best ever! I’m retired, so I have unlimited time to devote to my favorites, and I have a huge collection of game consoles and physical copies of many, many games!\n\nWow, that’s awesome man. Keep being cool.\n\nThanks!\n\nI’m also playing Baten Kaitos when I get to frustrated with Hellblade.\n\n&gt; I’ve been addicted to gaming since Pong was introduced!\n\nThat was my introduction as well. Anyone that complains about the cost of games today never fed quarters into Pac-Man...\n\nGalaga and, later, Tailgunner got a lot of my quarters!🤣\n\nWhat games are you enjoying these days?\n\nI recently quit Fallout 76 at level 265 or thereabouts, and right now I’m halfway through HellbladeSenua’s Sacrifice. I’m trying to finish all the PS4 games that I might like before finally buying the Ps5. I have a few titles to go, but not many!\n\nThis, super interested to hear more\n\nHow does one “put a cake together “\n\nI bought the bits and assembled it. I cant bake. At all.\n\nJust click on \"Cake\" on the cooking station.\n\nWould have been a lot less traumatic in the kitchen. Everything's blue now. Cupboards, sink, floor, wife.\n\n[I'm afraid you just blue yourself](https://c.tenor.com/_Donca-oV40AAAAC/tenor.gif)\n\ni just binged this entire series for the first time a few weeks ago and am so glad i can finally get all those references.\n\neven from episode 1, \"there's always money in the banana stand\". i was like \"OOOH that's where it's from!\"\n\nLmao a friend of mine just watched this series and I finally have a buddy to share all those stupid references, life is good brotha\n\nI had the same feeling when i watched Chuck for the first time and it got to the scene where Sarah throws the \"up-vote\" at Chuck lol\n\nHaha not far off\n\nDa ba dee da ba doo\n\nThis you?   \n  \nhttps://i.imgur.com/Ij30doQ.jpeg\n\nViva la Bam!\n\nHahaha! Classic\n\nDa ba dee da ba di ?\n\nExactly. Haha.\n\nYou’re so funny OP, I’m sure your son loved his cake! It looks awesome:)) Hope kiddo had a great birthday!\n\nOr ask Mr. Handy to make it for you\n\nThey sell.. cake bits? Is it the same spot they sell iguana bits?\n\nCan you read? Can you understand what you just read? You can bake if yes. \n\nSheet cakes are very easy to do yourself. Hardest part here would be the design, I'm guessing you had something printed out on fondant or something. \n\nLooks good. Try baking it yourself next time. Boxed cake mix is designed to be user friendly and it almost always tastes at least as good as 100% from scratch if you follow the directions.\n\nThat is so not true. I'm an excellent cook but I can't bake myself even a good box cake. It's not as easy as just following directions. I mean watch the GBBO for God's sake\n\nThey don't use boxed cake mixes there. \n\nBoxed cake mixes ARE that simple. No offense, but if you can't bake a boxed cake, that's on you 99% of the time. Unless you have trouble with your oven with everything (in which case, that's still your fault for using a messed up oven), there's no excuse. They tell you exactly what to use and how much to use. Put it all in a bowl and mix it up. Then spray your pan and pour the batter in. Put it in the oven with a timer for a few minutes less than the time listed on the box. It will be done +/-5 minutes of the suggested time usually (usually +5 IME).\n\nI've cooked boxed cake mixes since I was in the single digits 100% by myself. The ONLY trick is knowing when to take it out. For most cakes, you want the toothpick to come out clean.\n\nThen put the icing on. If you're like me and you'd rather have a little more icing to make it easier, whip the icing in the containers for a minute or so to aerate it some. It gives it more volume and makes it a LOT easier to spread. It does lighten the color though, so if you're going for dark chocolate, it's not ideal.\n\nSimple really, I usually put my apron on then my chefs hat and I drive over to Costco and buy one.\n\nI put on my robe and wizard hat.\n\ncrush memory racial sort sparkle melodic steer crown makeshift whole\n\nI guess I could build her a cake or something\n\nVote for Pedro\n\n“Build her a cake or something”\n\nOder it\n\nArgue about stuff that does not really matter\n\nPay about 200 bucks\n\nTell everyone you \"made\" it\n\nDidn't bake it and didn't claim to.\n\nBought a bunch of stuff to decorate a plain cake.\n\nPaid £25\n\nWas happy with how it turned out.\n\nMade son happy.\n\nJust curious, where did you buy the picture on top? Is it edible?\n\nIt is yeah. Asda do a printing service onto icing so made the image on my phone and got it printed there. You can order it on their website.\n\nThat's cool. Great idea for birthday cake\n\nThanks\n\nBro don't listen to the haters. Amazing job you did.\n\nThanks. My piping skills must be on point because loads of people said its too neat haha. Without sounding like an ass, I'm a professional tattooist with a degree in art and a history in sculpting so I'm capable of decorating a bloody cake, just awful at baking a sponge haha.\n\nI find that bizarre. Baking sponge cake is the easiest part of it all, because you just have to do exactly what the recipe says. If you measure everything and follow the instructions, it's hard to go wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, I've had a go at cake decorating and piping before, and I just don't have the skill with my hands to make it look really neat.\n\nBruh I didn't know we can just buy a fuckin plane cake to decorate it!!\n\nNeither did I until recently. The wife usually bakes the sponges but we've got a baby too now so times a bit stretched so it's a pretty useful thing to be able to buy. Wasn't expensive for the decorating stuff either.\n\nYa dude that's bad ass. You totally nailed the frosting. The ones I buy at the store last minute don't look that clean. \n\nI gotta make my own so I can get ignorant on the sprinkles. I'm talking SPRINKLES!\n\nNo you didn’t.\n\nneeds more rad roaches\n\nWhat do you think’s in the ~~burger~~ filling?\n\nPretty sure fondant is just ground up radroaches\n\nThe coloring is sponsored by RadX\n\n*Criminy more roaches*\n\nHow do you put images like that on a cake? Is it a machine that does it?\n\nI made the image on my phone and the shop I used have a printer that prints edible ink onto sheet icing.\n\nYou’re a thoughtful parent 👍\n\nVault-Tec projection technology\n\nOp bought the cake with a custom print\n\nLevel 18 is the time to introduce him to psycho, jet and buffout 👍🏼\n\nAnd pipe pistols/rifles!\n\nPsychojet and psychobuff! Psycho alone is a waste.\n\nLevel 87178291200 ???\n\nr/accidentalfactorial\n\nNice. Definitely got some skills on that pipboy. Vault-tec would approve.\n\nFor real, is 14 old enough to play fallout? I suppose every kid is different.\n\nFor context i have a little girl about 5 and I'm navigating content ratings as a parent for the first time. Don't think I'm bashing OP's parenting\n\nMy mom always went with a “+1” mentality when looking at ratings. As in, if I was 7 I could play games rated E and one higher (so E-10+). When I was 10 or 11, I could do up to T, and finally as a teenager she would get me M games if she had some time to look into them first. \n\nI think more games are M now so you might have to take it with a grain of salt, but I turned out alright\n\nYeah he's good. I've played games since about 1990 so I'm very familiar with everything he's played. Always introduced him to new stuff when I thought the time was right.\n\nNot a parent but I assume that just given the fact that you have an interest in making sure you are doing the right thing gives them a better chance of turning out alright. I think a lot of the notions of, for just one example, violent movies or games causing violent behavior, are generally only true when the home situation is dysfunctional in some way or the individual themselves see themself as outcast from or offset from \"normal\" society as a result of various traumas or a world-view shaped over time without someone to correct their way of thinking.\n\nBecause without proper contextualization of often violent subject matter in a vacuum there does seem to be the danger of the \"violence solves everything\" mindset over prolonged exposure to \"american media\" that could result if there is no guidance at all, and each game's handling of this varies to wide degrees. For example in the cod series, are they playing single player, where there's a plotline and, as far as I remember, every time you died ingame there was a quote or passage on the perils or dangers of war and violence, or are they playing multiplayer cod lobbies with no supervision before they're able to process what other people are saying and how they're reacting. But even in the single player game, the main way to advance in the storyline is by shooting people, and the implications of that are not weighed on that heavily.\n\nI think that what I'm getting at is that throughout movies and games and music etc is there actually is just an abundance of them that have a very callous attitude towards very serious subject matters that could possibly prime people to act without thinking if they weren't taught how to act by anything else.\n\nThe only way to be really sure would be to literally play every game beforehand or alongside them until the point at which you can be confident in their own understanding level which, like isn't the worst thing lol.\n\nAlso, that's a very nice cake op!\n\nI remember playing Fallout 3 at around 14yo and enjoying it a lot as a RPG, getting scared to death every time I stumbled upon a building infested with ghouls was fun, I’d say it depends on the level of maturity of the kid in question\n\nFallout 1 came out when I was 14. I played it and loved it at the time.\n\nParent of the year. I would of went ballistic as a kid if my mom showed up with a cake like that for me.\n\nSorry, but ”would have”\n\nAnd 'gone'. Would have gone.\n\n*wood of\n\nThis is outstanding!\n\nBeautiful cake\n\nNice 👍\n\nThanks 👍\n\nOk i want this for my 20th Bday\n\nThat cake looks amazing and delicious! I’d probably eat the whole thing myself, and it would go straight to my waist land.\n\nYou are the coolest dad ever. Nice job on the cake too.\n\nHaha thanks.\n\nThat's awesome!\n\nlove the energy\n\nDamn that's a good looking cake\n\nAlright. You officially beat the Batman cake I got at my 6th birthday, 36 years ago.\n\nHaha! Nothing wrong with a batman cake. I had a sonic cake about 32 years ago.\n\nthat's perfect as a 6 year old.\n\nIf he doesn't like it, they'll be a fallout\n\nWell played\n\nThat ain't put together, it was beautifully constructed!\n\nHaha thanks. First time I've ever piped icing. Was ready to get the wife involved but actually wasn't as difficult as I expected.\n\nIf by \"put together\" you mean bought at a store then nice.Great cake\n\nThoughtful and unique\n\nWhat’s with all the fallout posts all over social media? Hype for new fallout?\n\nShow started airing a few weeks ago and is well received yes.\n\nW parent\n\nWow!!! Amazing, looks delicious 🤤\n\nGreat work!! I'm sure it will mean a lot to him.\n\nThat’s awesome\n\nYou are an awesome Parent. Kudos on a beauty of a cake\n\nThanks :)\n\ndont bite on the lunchbox and nuka cola  bottle inside\n\nSuper fuckin cool!\n\nThat is really cool, well done.\n\nI found the inspiration for my 47th birthday cake!\n\nNice cake, dweller. Don't forget to make him do the G.O.A.T. test when he turns 16. Everyone needs to fill his role in vault 55, your son included. -Overseer\n\nBetter keep that box level when transporting it. You don't want the cake to ....\n\n....\n\n\n...\n\n\n...\n\n\n\n_ fall out _\n\nWell played\n\nThat cake need to be preserved not cut ever\n\nCan I come to his party?\n\nAh your son is turning 10? How cool!\n\nThat is epic!  👍\n\nGlad they got past __level 12!__ 😅😬\n\nAwww that's really really sweet!\n\nVery nice\n\nabsolutely doing this for my birthday\n\nWow if I was a Fallout fan I would be so psyched to get this cake!\n\nwell this is the coolest thing i've seen today.\n\ni'm surprised you're cool with your kids playing the games tho they have alot of extra fucked up places in them lol\n\nlike every single vault is like the worst science experiment/torture prison etc.\n\nNext birthday, you need to make a perfectly preserved pie.  Put it a claw machine (one that doesn't pick up anything) and have him try to get the birthday pie.  If he loves fallout 4, he will love this.  Guaranteed hours of entertainment and frustration!\n\nTook care of a patient the other day that had this guy tattooed on his arm lol\n\nTHIS IS PERFECT\n\nYour cake is level 100!\n\nThat’s an amazing cake!\n\nI'm a Baker by trade and I am curious as to how the image is done. I can think of two ways, printed , or buttercream transfer? I have done many things like silk screening buttercream , printing on edible paper, buttercream transfers, stencils. The cake 8s epic by the way, I'm a huge Fallout fan!\n\nI bought this cake for my son’s birthday.\n\ni can hear the level up jingle for some reason\n\nI sense a good parent\n\nWhere's the jelly mold?\n\n[deleted]\n\nHe's gonna be sooo happy\n\nThanks for the inspiration!!! Might surprise my BF with one for his birthday :)\n\nGo for it! Only cost about £25 to do. £15 for the plain cake, £5 for the printing onto the icing and about £5 for the icing and blue gel etc. The wife already had the piping bags and stuff so might need those if you don't have some already :)\n\nThank you very much!!!\n\n\"Why do people prefer Jello Cake over Apple Pie? I don't know they just do!\"\n\n\"The perfect cake doesn't exi....\"\n\nBest parent ever.  I'm 49 this July and I want that cake!\n\nThis cake is amazing! Loving the series so far as well\n\nThanks. Pretty good series isn't it?\n\nYeah only on episode 6 they need to hurry with the next season 😅\n\nI said the same haha. I'll not spoil what you get a glimps of at the end but I practically fell off the sofa in excitement for series 2 😂\n\nNow I might have to savor it\n\nEnjoy\n\nVery cool!  Almost the age to take the G.O.A.T.\n\nnICE\n\nlevel 14 is a good incorporation too\n\nDope as hell\n\nLove it!\n\nHow do you get the image so crisp? Is it printed somehow?\nLooks amazing BTW!\n\nyou raised your kid so well &lt;3\n\nThat is actually awesome\n\nHell yeah\n\ndude this is absolutely amazing so creative keep up the good work man!\n\nWow, what’s the geiger counter reading?! It looks super good!\n\nMy 30th is coming up and I want it.\n\nNice\n\nAmazing\n\nIs this a lie? (You know why I’m asking)\n\nNice.\n\nAwesome.\n\nMissed opportunity to use the cake from Portal, but still happy birthday for your son\n\nThat look really good\n\nVery nicely done!!\n\ndaaamn would have loved it to have gotten one like that as a kid    great parenting !!\n\nInteresting definition of \"put together,\" given it was clearly ordered and picked up. You were so lazy you couldn't even be bothered to consider that detail and hide it, and you expect me to believe you made this?\n\nr/unexpectedfactorial 87,178,291,200 years? how ancient is your family?\n\nThink he means ordered from the bakery\n\nYou didn’t put shit together. You obviously ordered\n\nThis is pretty cool. You dont get older, you level up."

    "all_comment_text": "they had so many books to base the show off of but noooooooooooooo\n\nAnd games. So many opportunities to be like “yeah this was happening in between/in the background of the games”. Like ODST. Sigh\n\nI mean they literally did the fall of reach and removed 90% of what made halo reach interesting like having actual Spartans fight in their armour.\n\nAt this point Red vs Blue feels more in canon to a Halo Animated Series. Just treated like how Star Trek has Lower Decks for the chaotic and more comedy focused stuff happening in their universe.\n\n[deleted]\n\n\"having actual Spartans fight in their armour.\"\n\nthey literally failed at every aspect of the adaption\n\nGod and it was just so poorly done. It was this weird action hero thing with really unconvincing costume design and an absolutely bizarre script. I couldn't stand more than a few episode of the first season because it hurt it watch.\n\nI heard rumors that they tried to make a Mass Effect show and couldn't get the license, so they just got a different license and didn't make a different show.\n\nSomewhat glad if this is the case. I really do not want these people anywhere near *Mass Effect*.\n\nThese idiots shouldn’t be allowed anywhere near a camera to shoot a dogfood commercial. Absolute hacks.\n\nFirst mistake - taking two whole seasons just to get to Halo. \n\nSecond mistake - way too much about the random girl from the colony and the ex spartan. \n\nSo much potential. All they had to do was follow the source material. \n\nA true master class in failure despite every opportunity to succeed.\n\nThey could have just followed Halo: Reach story for the first season and Halo: CE for Season 2. It was so simple\n\nAnd there are elements from the books they could pull from if they felt like they needed additional storylines to jump between other than Chief and his immediate situation.   \n\n\n- Season 1 is Fall of Reach + Halo Reach   \n- Season 2 is Halo 1 + The Flood   \n- Season 3 is Halo First Strike + Halo 2  \n- Season 4 is Halo 3 + Ghosts,of Onyx   \n\n\nAnd then it ends there, because that's a complete story lol.\n\nAs a person who's not an avid fan of the Halo IP I would have loved to have seen a Fall of Reach series because I did love the shit out of the book back in the day.\n\nYou get half an episode\n\nCould have followed the source material and struck gold. Instead they gave us Master Cheeks.\n\nHow the fuck did they screw up Master Chief that badly though\n\nit's a great reference meme for future projects. \"don't think you can insert your own character into a different world, the internet will make intense memes about his butt cheeks.\"\n\nBut people don't want to re-experience a story in a different form of medium!!\n\nNow, to watch Lord of the Rings again.\nEdit: I meant the movies if it wasn't obvious.\n\n0th mistake: MC spends most of the show outside his suit.\n\nremember when he went to have taco dinner with some like latin/hispanic family? \n\nwtf was going on with the writers...\n\nWild. They tried so hard to humanize him when the first four seasons of Dexter proved people are willing to cheer for a literal psychopath if done right. \n\nTo me a big part of the appeal of the MC is that in order to fight the aliens, he has to sacrifice much of his humanity to do so. He has to lose what it is he wants to save.\n\nThat nuance is completely lost in the show.\n\nThey also had him remove his helmet so that people could see his expressions and connect with him, as if the Mandalorian hadn't already proven you could make an extremely succesful show with a protagonist that wears their helmet religiously. \n\nIt really feels like the show was a pre planned story with a Halo sticker on top because nobody was letting them film it as an original IP.\n\nYeah, it has those vibes for sure now that you mention it. But even that can be done right with the right adjustments. \n\nDie Hard: With a Vengeance, was a Lethal Weapon script.\n\nAnd before Mando, Dredd 2012 pulled off the always on helmet. In fact, come to think of it, that was a better Halo movie than this was a Halo show.\n\nLike, the game itself found halo at the end of the first mission!\n\nHell, end of the tutorial, really\n\nThis seems to be such a common problem now with new shows. The Witcher, Wheel of Time, the end of Game of Thrones. These writers just want  to do fanfic instead of just give everyone what they want.\n\nMaster Cheeks\n\n# “We didn’t look at the game. We didn’t talk about the game. We talked about the characters and the world\"\n\nThe writers should have stuck to fanfic sites.\n\nSeriously. Its so crazy to me. You have all this lore to pull from. For the fans. And you fail. The content is there. How do you fuck it up?\n\nBecause the writers think they know better than the audience, think they’re clever and can’t be wrong. Just look at star wars\n\nIt’s their chance to really show people what they’re about, and time after time people get lost in the meta. It’s no longer about making the fandom happy, or making a story respectful to the world they hope to operate in, and it shows.\n\nSee the thing that pisses me off is that if they wanted to write their own story there are tons of stories in the universe they could have used. Pre-reach colony invasions, a redo of the original spatan program, an anthology of stores from ODST/ONI/other Spartan groups. Hell, they could have tackled the Infinite story 343 failed to tell us.\n\nInstead they bastardized one of the most well known and extensive game stories around. Fuck them, fuck paramount, fuck 343 and Microsoft for greenlighting this because right now for me with all the missteps Halo is dead. I'm not looking forward to any new property and I'm not even playing Infinite. Every single person involved in Halo for the last 5-10 years should be fired as far as I'm concern because none of them seem to have any sense.\n\nI couldn’t agree more, man. They’ve mishandled this franchise for so fucking long at this point that I have no hope for anything else. It just keeps getting worse and worse.\n\nHad a rough day at work, but cheered up remembering I'm not as bad at my job as these people. \n\nI can't imagine being so awful that you manage to kill what was once THE premier gaming franchise\n\nEveryone and their grandmothers used to advertise as the \"Halo killer\" and always fell short.\n\nLittle did they know, the only one who could kill Halo was Halo.\n\nAgreed. This is a how dare you moment.\n\nLet's call it what it is. Gross hubris.\n\nOften these writers have their own creative projects that they want to get filmed and see an IP like Halo as a way to either get their story out there, or give them enough creative cred to get more work.\n\n\"hey we have rights to Y \"popular franchise\" and X script for a show that has nothing to do with Y franchise, how about we hodgepodge them together? The fans will love it!\"\n\nThe Witcher is another example of Hollywood not caring about the audience and fan base.\n\nThey are not fans, gamers, nerds, whatever. They're \"writers\" and God damnit they know better than you. They have nothing but contempt for their audience.\n\nAnd The Witcher\n\nIt's bad when even the lead actor quits due to them completely shitting on the lore\n\nand then they try very hard to smear him as an asocial nerd making the production difficult\n\nit was sad when Henry Cavill decided to leave the production, but high levels of respect to him for standing up for the actual lore and story of the source materials and audience. I haven’t touched S2 ever since.\n\nthey should learn from the fallout series. that's how you turn a video game world into a series\n\nStill a worse love story than twilight?\n\nSomeone should make it mandatory that the writers must watch a play through of the game before adapting any project. First Fully Charged now this.\n\n[removed]\n\nThis same shit happens in software development. They get lost in their own vision and forget what the business exists for.\n\nparamount would never get IPs again if they had to read the base material first\n\nSo nothing of value would be lost then.\n\nWhat a shame. Because now, to any studio, a Halo show/movie is a proven failure. But they'd just stuck to the source material and honored it, it would probably be greenlit for a 3rd instead of probably never happening again.\n\nIt's funny how nobody looks at Fallout and thinks \"maybe we should really respect the source material.\" If you make a show about a game, you should do so in a way that'll make those players want to watch, then they'll spread positive word of mouth, and others will come. Making a show about a game and essentially alienating the people most likely to give it a chance is moronic.\n\nWhen the source material is the reason most people are watching your show, you should probably use the source material.\n\nThey didn't even need to use Master Chief as a character, they could easily have made new characters in the setting and told entirely new events. As long as it lined up with the canonical timeline and followed the established rules of the franchise, it would have been fine if it was a good story.\n\nODST tv show would rip\n\nDisaster Chief\n\n'Master Cheeks, can you tell me what you are doing in there with that Covenant Girl?'\n\nSir, finishing this nut.\n\nJust some war crimes with a criminal sir. Sadly, I didn't wear a helmet either.\n\nGiving the covenant their bomb back\n\nJohn Halo\n\nThat’s not John Halo. John Halo would never take his helmet off. This, this is Jimmy Rings.\n\nActually John Halo did take his helmet off at the end of the first game.\n\nWhat was under it was another helmet.\n\nThey saw Fallout's 16 Emmy nominations and gave up.\n\nI'm still convinced the Halo show was a completely unrelated new IP that the showrunners were forced to slap the Halo brand on top of.\n\nIt was supposed to be mass effect, there's no doubt in my mind. There's so many parallels, especially the \"looming alien threat nobody believes is coming\"\n\nwhat about the \"touch the precursor thingamajig and get visions that turn you into THE CHOSEN ONE?\"\n\nthe whole thing with chief is that he's lucky, he's got a superdupersuit and he's got a supersmart robotlady in his brain (in the show he's massively unlucky, doesn't wear his armor, and he loses/doesn't trust his super smart lady.)\n\n it's not that he happened to be the guy that touched a thing somewhere.\n\nIt's almost like they actually did research on the character but only to do the opposite out of spite\n\nMaster Chief is quiet? Make him talk\n\nHe almost never takes off his armor? Strip him\n\nHe has earned every medal except being a prisoner of war? Make him commit war crimes\n\nHe's so close to Cortana that he stands up for her against authority figures? \"Cortana do me a favor and shut the fuck up\"\n\nAccepted his fate as a child soldier because he understands that his sacrifice is good for humanity? Make him be brainwashed\n\nIt has to be on purpose... right?\n\nNot to mention alien sex\n\nThey added WHAT to halo????\n\nOh it's so SOOOOO much worse. Master Chief fucks a human prisoner of war who's a member of the covenant. I'm not making that up.\n\nWhich is funnily enough a war crime!\n\nScreenwriters: \"WHAT DO YOU MEAN THEY STUCK TO THE SOURCE MSTERIAL??\"\n\nOne of the awards is Outstanding Writing. I love that Fallout games is known for its sounds and music. They are nominated for Sound Editing, Mixing and Music.\n\nI really enjoyed that the music of Fallout was mostly music from the games. \n\nEven the songs that weren’t were perfect for the show. I’ve had Act Naturally by Buck Owens stuck in my head for weeks now.\n\nIt is a bit ironic having a show made by Amazon with the song Sixteen Tons in it as well, but alas here we are.\n\nI think black mirror had an episode about this! You can watch it on netf… oh…\n\nUnbelievable! They don’t know what they’re doing! /s\n\nSorry, we can’t hire you. You are a fan of the property and that will get in the way of your writing ability!\n\nRIP my boy Henry Cavill, getting done the same way.\n\nHe got done so dirty. They tried to run his name through the dirt when their egos couldn't handle how right he was and wrong they were\n\nIt's so strange.  You have an A list talent on board for a NETFLIX show because he loves the source material and knows that an adaptation would be awesome.   And then they...... don't adapt the source material?   Like,  why did you think he was happy to do a Netflix show?   The catering?\n\nBecause someone wants to make it their own, do their own thing, and the \"source material\" takes away their agency to do it. So they don't.\n\nThen they should make something original instead of making an adaptation of something\n\nThat would require talent they don't possess.\n\nEverybody knows HBO has the best catering, Netflix can't even compete.\n\nThe wealthy truly are that detatched and oblivious.\n\nPetty little parasites. All too common in the industry; talentless dogwater gets a mild break (often because of office politics/brown nosery) and suddenly imagine they're Hemingway, and they deserve to rewrite super popular works of art because they're 'just fantasy/scifi' or 'just games'.\n\nWitcher got shit canned right? I haven't heard anything about it in a while, and figured that's the reason why.\n\nHeard something about him being involved in some Warhammer 40k project, that still a thing?\n\nLast I heard Amazon snagged up the rights, Cavill was set to produce and star in it, and a bunch of rumors circle the internet with no real answers.\n\nIt’s officially happening as Games Workshop officially announced it, but there’s very sparse details as of yet.\n\nThe Halo showrunner , the Witcher showrunner or the two schmucks who delivered that final season of GoT when they ran out of material to sometimes very loosely adapt?\n\nNa D&amp;D did a good job adapting the game of thrones books, they were extremely lucky to be chosen by GRRM and supported by an incredible cast, production crew, writing room, and fandom for the first 5 seasons.\n\nThe reason they’re hated is because despite all that they had been given, they chose to destroy the show and end it prematurely because they wanted to make a Star Wars movie. It’s the utter lack of responsibility or gratitude that really gets me, they didn’t even let another group of writers take over to finish the rest of the show. Instead they chose to destroy it, and for that I do genuinely hate them.\n\nAnd now after hearing from people involved in production, I can safely say it’s deserved. They’re apparently huge egotistical assholes and the way they treated Varys’ actor, Sansa’s actress, and Emilia Clarke was quite frankly disgusting.\n\nEdit: yes I know season 5 isn’t great either\n\nDon’t forget how they treated Barristan Selmy’s actor. They mocked him for trying to tell them it was a bad idea to kill him off the way they did, despite him having a MUCH bigger role in the books. \n\nGreatest swordsmen in the realm, dying in the street to common thugs in masks, just terrible writing.\n\nAlso didn’t they basically admit to having Ayra kill the Night King even though GRRM said it was Jon who was meant to kill him?\n\nYeah, at this point they were just doing the dumbest shit to be edgy and spite people.\n\nSubverting expectations is the dumbest, egotistical excuse producers and showrunners have when taking from source material. As though a story that is already well written and received won't do well even if fans know it's coming.\n\nThe best part? Their approach to end GoT made them lose their contract with Disney and ended up with nothing.\n\nGreed eventually can get to ya.\n\nOOTL, how did they treat Varys Sansa and Emilia?\n\nIt’s sad because while I can totally understand wanting to work on something new, they really should have handed it off if they didn’t think they had it in them to finish it.\n\nThey were running one of the biggest shows of all time and threw it away/rushed it for a project that never even happened\n\n&gt;Wait, you mean we were supposed to try?\n\nbow hurry hard-to-find memorize edge school icky test aromatic alleged\n\nIt's almost like people who play video games do so for more reasons than just \"head go splash when crit lololo\", and people who *make* video games are actually more than just drugged up antisocials feeding HTML into their parents' old PC in the basement.\n\nYou're goddamn right.\n\nIt's almost like honoring the source material is the way to go.\n\nFallout has made some changes, but it's still very recognizably Fallout and feels like Fallout.  When my wife and I watched we were excited to look for hidden details and easter eggs in every episode.  Things that indicate the people making the show actually know about the universe and respect it.  The games were popular, already, for good reason.\n\nIt's a shame Halo (and the Witcher 😭)didn't get the same respect, and I'm sad for all the people out of a job because of it, but the writing was on the wall.\n\nFallout.  It just works.\n\nTo be fair, this is the one time that is completely true.\n\nSame issue as the Witcher. They wanted to use the source material as a built in audience but didn’t actually like or care about the source material.\n\nA shame too, cause I still watched it cause I liked Henry's portrayal of Geralt. They could even have made it an original story if they wanted (I mean CD Projekt Red did it)\n\nAw well.\n\nWasn't Henry the only one on the show who actually was a fan of the books/games? Iirc he actually left the show over it.\n\nFairly sure they pretty much laughed him out of the writers room when he raised concerns about the writing / direction of the show due to them wanting to produce there own stories despite the source material being a literal gold mine sign me up for geralt killing monsters every episode\n\nEDIT: guys stop spamming my inbox calling me a\nFucking idiot for saying I liked Geralt just\nKilling monsters let’s just hope whoever touches the source material next does it justice\n\nDon't forget that after he left the showrunner tried to imply he was a sexist asshole on set instead of owning up to their bad writing\n\nThat's a really obvious lie from the showrunner, I know there's alot of actors who are two faced when in public versus in private but damn Cavil comes off as either the most genuine guy in acting or somehow  is basically Homelander if what the showrunners say is true which I doubt\n\nIt was an obvious lie because even within that rumor mill there was no concrete examples of Henry actually doing anything remotely sexist. It was literally all just \"vibes.\"\n\nIn certain corners of the internet (you know, the celebrity gossip trash internet) there are people who dislike Henry Cavill almost entirely because he's liked by a lot of nerdy gamer bros.\n\nAlso he, himself, is a nerdy game bro. I remember a video where his co-actors say that no matter what you do, please don't ask Henry about games, or this interview will drag out to two hours of lore discussions.\n\nThey're just mad that an incredibly attractive man is also a giant nerd.\n\nGo figure, showrunner who can't write an entertaining show also can't write a convincing lie\n\nNot sure if he was the only one (probably), but some writers [even hated](https://www.pcgamer.com/some-of-the-witcher-show-writers-actively-disliked-the-books-and-games/) the source material (and u can kinda see it with all the invasive changes done)\n\n  \nStill sad HBO didnt get the rights for Witcher instead of Netflix, HotD is going pretty strong (and is actually close to source material)\n\n&gt; Still sad HBO didnt get the rights for Witcher instead of Netflix\n\n\"alright, we pretty much bodied everyone for years, time to become the absolute worst villians of streaming! let's start by cancelling everything good and limiting amount of screens people can use, for literally no fucking reason\"\n\nThey just needed to make the Witcher series a monster hunter series, Geralt taking a contract every episode to hunt and kill a monster. That castle sequence with the Striga fight was so good! We just wanted more of that.\n\nWhen it first came out I really thought we'd get more filler episodes of Geralt just doing his thing while the overarching plot creeps closer and closer. Alas, not really. There were some pretty great fight scenes, and moments that will stay memorable to me....but it really fizzled out quick...\n\nYeah, the Witchers best episodes were the ones that felt closest to the \"monster of the week,\" Hercules/Xena story telling style.\n\n\"Supernatural\" style as well would've worked perfectly fine.\n\nSupernatural but you're a fucking badass instead of some weakass human\n\nYep I watched it literally just because Henry Cavill did a great portrayal of Geralt.  Dude literally carried the show.\n\nMeanwhile Fallout and The Last Of Us stuck fairly close to the games and they were both universally praised by the gamers and general audience. I wonder if anyone in Hollywood will take note.\n\nHollywood: \"Amazong idea! Anyway, here's a God of War show, only Kratos is played by The Rock, and it's set in New York City\"\n\nDon't give them any ideas!!!\n\nWell, Last of Us basically just needed to do a shot for shot remake. The game was already very... cinematic from the get-go.\n\nFallout is, I think, more impressive because they just got the skeleton of the world but had to create the story much more from the ground up.\n\nThe skeleton world was actually to Fallout's advantage I always thought.\n\nWith games like Halo, they're very centred around a single character and their plot. You start making changes to either and things go badly. \n\nFallout on the other hand is specifically designed for 'random stranger gets involved with the plot' style stories. So long as you don't break the lore, you can basically tell whatever story you want.\n\nYeah but you can copy the story of halo very closely and you are there.\n\nI would have been ecstatic with this.\n\nFallout has some very solid, repeated story beats that the show landed.\n\nVaults are awesome!  \nSomething happens to a family member, I must go save them.  \nVaults are kinda fucked up!  \nMy family member is kinda fucked up!  \ndogmeat\n\nThe sad part was S1 of the Witcher was ok, but was confusing for a first watch and needed time line subtitles. S2 was S2 and never bothered going further for obvious reasons.\n\nHalo dyin a slow painful death smh\n\n[removed]\n\nBro. They had the best fucking IP lore to IRL world parallel. And they fumbled the bag. Cortana, the fuckin blue AI lady, with i believe partially alien reverse engineered tech? Was the name of the phone/computer assistant. Insane.  But it wasnt very useful and was pushed on people aaand everyone including myself opted out of it.\n\nCortana and all Halo UNSC AI's are the result of scanning a living humans brain so they may become an AI. This always kills the patient undergoing the scan, except in the case of Cortana. She is the brain scan of Dr. Catherine Halsey, the mother of the SPARTAN program. Her intelligence was deemed a high value asset to the UNSC, and they figured if they could scan her brain without killing her, they'll basically get her in 2 places at the same time, but they are both individuals working separately from eachother.\n\nHaving Cortana placed in Chiefs care was one of the major and most significant reasons the Human-Covenant war ended in UNSC-coalition victory.\n\nSo they have an operation that is 100% fatal, and decide to only be able to find a way not to kill the patient for 1 person?\n\nTheir method was to clone her and then just kill the clone lol.\n\nLmao\n\nIirc, Th1nkfas3 forgot the part where &gt;!they flash-cloned Halsey's brain and destroyed that flash-cloned brain in the process of creating her AIs. Also worth noting that while the AI-creation process destroys the brain, they typically used the brains of the recently deceased rather than doing it and killing them. They used flash cloning when they kidnapped children for the Spartan Program too.!&lt;\n\nCan’t believe they did two seasons\n\nRight? This show had so much potential to follow a great story and they fumbled the ball hard. It's a shame, I was really looking forward to it. Then a show like Fallout comes out and it completely knocks Halo out of the park\n\nThey could have made a show about the main characters that was faithful to the games.\n\n\n*Or*\n\n\nThey could have made a show about new characters in a new story that weren't in the games.\n\n\n*Instead*\n\n\nThey made a show about the main characters in a new story that completely contradicted the games. Literally the worst possible idea.\n\nAnd a lot of it was boring to watch. I could not have cared less about the ex-spartan and random girl storylines.\n\nI normally say \"Give new shows at least two seasons.\"\n\nI still say that, but Halo got that and absolutely deserves to be axed now.\n\nRenew Lower Decks instead, Paramount.\n\nLower decks is cancelled??? 😭\n\nYup.\n\nThere's a fan movement to renew it. Look it up and join! SDCC is next weekend, too, and I'm sure there's more than a few LD fans planning on doing something at the Star Trek panels.\n\nMS wants to continue the show somewhere else. I think they should not continue but reboot. Start over on a different network with fucking directors and writers that  will play the game and do their homework. Creating your own shit is just ego manic bullshit. Look at what those idiots did with resident evil on netflix. Had nothing to do with the show and it was beyond trash. Cancelled so fast\n\nthey gave it a 5th and fnal season to close it out. Kurtzman gave the excuse, \"No shows are expected to run more than 5 or so seasons on streaming\".\n\n[removed]\n\nThe problem is, it's probably not going to be a \"next time\". These things are often a \"you get one chance\" kinda thing. And they blew it. Nobody is going to want to touch the Halo series because they think nobody wants it.\n\nIn a common sense world they'd see how much discussion the show created online even if it was bad publicity and recognise that halo fans would watch a halo show created as a halo machinima if it just had decent writing.\n\nGod, that [Neill Blomkamp teaser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyOAdrxlPVs) was so long ago\n\nImagine getting to drive the warthog.\n\n“No I think we need another take, I can definitely do better”\n\nNeil blomkamp is so damn good at gritty scifi.\n\nWhat the Halo show not about Halo got cancelled? Shocking.\n\n[deleted]\n\nThe surf Dracula problem \n\nAfter all their smugness on “their direction,” being proud they didn’t play the games or read the books I’d love to hear them interview now.\n\nI genuinely hope other studios look really carefully at the immediate negative reception of this show and why that happened. Before the first season even came out, producers of the show seemed almost cocky about the fact that they did not play any Halo games and would not use the games as any basis for what the show would be about. They used the Halo name and that's it. If you don't want to make a show that's faithful to the games to please gamers, then you at least need a good story to pull casual audiences in. This show had neither. Now look at Fallout. This show didn't follow any one of the games specifically when it came to its story, but it took an array of references and settings from the series as a whole, and then constructed a good story around that. They pulled in gamers and casual viewers in alike. That's how you do it. Good riddance to this trash.\n\nHas there been a single project where the writers came in with a chip on their shoulder and the finished product was any good?\n\nAll I had to do was watch one trailer where he takes his helmet off to understand the show was butchered and I didn’t even need to waste my time or anger.\n\nAnd this came out after The Mandalorian! You can do incredible helmeted characters if you find the right actor for it.\n\nAnd they were still able to humanize him to incredible effect. The Halo writers thinking they couldn’t do that in the suit just betrays their lack of ability. \n\nYep, as soon as I heard he takes his helmet off I knew everything I needed to.\n\nThen I heard he fucks an alien...\n\n&gt; fucks an alien \n\nOh it's worse. He fucks a human who the covenant captured as a child and raised as their own (despite the lore being that they *never* took hostages and considered humans trash and abominable) who is able to be above the Elite class and command them (again, what the fuck) and has weird super powers and body mods like an energy sword for a fingernail. \n\nWhile Cortana awkwardly watches from the cuck chair.\n\nIf I hadn't already heard this was the case, I'd say you were trolling lol. Always sounded so bad. \n\nThey fucking what?!\n\nLiterally not one word of exaggeration\n\nYes. This is all true.\n\nWow that's... I have no words\n\nAnd then she dies, and then comes back to life in season 2 for some reason \n\nAnd there's a weird subplot with an annoying girl from a no name planet that you've never heard of. I truly don't know why they decided Madrigal had to be part of the new lore.\n\nUnlike most fans of existing franchises, I don't mind when adaptations make up their own lore. But at least make it make sense and make it be compelling, not annoying.\n\nLmao what the actual fuck. That sounds like a Halo  story written by a group of horny 13 years olds who smoke a lot of meth and have never played Halo.\n\nParamount green lit the second season before the first season even premiered. That’s the ONLY reason this dog shit show got two seasons.\n\nJust finished season two. Couldn’t believe they really took ALL of those two seasons to finally get to Halo and show it for a few minutes. \n\nWhat a damn waste of time it was watching this show. \n\nThat Landfall video from over a decade ago was way better than the entirety of the show. \n\nGood.\n\nEvery episode felt like it was written by a schizophrenic experiencing a near life ending fever dream.\n\nMake a ODST Show. Band of Brothers style. Do the Insurrection of the Colonies and you got a winner.\n\nThis crap. I don't even know.\n\nI feel bad for the cast and crew... Save for the writers. The writers were terrible, made the absolute worst possible decisions at every turn. If I didn't know better I'd say they were shitposting.\n\nThank god\n\nThank god\n\nLet Master Cheeks rest, and let us speak of him no more\n\nGood. The show was hilariously bad.\n\nAs an avid halo enjoyer since I was a kid it has been painful watching the mismanagement of the Halo franchise since reach.\n\nrip The John Halo Super Show\n\nWas it bad?\n\nReally bad, felt like watching fanfiction, i wanted the time i spent on it back.\n\nFanfiction  by someone who had never played a Halo game, but who had a friend who's brother told them about it over dinner one time while they were only half paying attention.\n\nAnd they hated it so they wanted to change everything.\n\nI know there were rumors at one point it was a failed scifi show pitch that added Halo to it way after the fact and it feels so true.\n\nFanfiction written by a high schooler trying to fluff for volume.\n\n\nI only needed a mediocre adaption to be happy. It did not bring joy\n\nBiggest fumble in video game tv history\n\nSo many popular sci-fi IPs being ruined by people who don’t even care about the actual IP."

It'd finally get the boomers mobilized against him. They're the ones currently on it / closest to needing it, and Gen X ain't far behind.  \nPlus he'll be so busy doing that he won't be able to strip rights away from vulnerable group.\n\nLmao they're never waking up. They'll die with their Trump flags in hand. The news won't report on it and none of them will believe it coming from anyone other than the right-wing influencers and media figures.\n\nFor anyone reading, the reason social security is and has been going down the shitter is the same reason that has been attacking and destroying basically any social spending policy in the US for generations.\n\nIf you are curious what that reason might be then feel free to look up voting records and who brings what bills to the floor. You will see a hilariously one-sided pattern.\n\nHint. Republicans want to take away your social security.\n\nYeah, don't bank too much on that social security thing...\n\nWhy i hate the older generations honestly. \n\n\nThey get to enjoy the benefits of literally everything and pull up the ladder right behind them.\n\n\nWere paying for their retirement if they cancel ss.\n\n\nTens of thousands of dollars out of my pocket at this point, but they wouldnt understand. Pull out an inflation calculator if you want to see how absolutely fucked things are now.  \n\nClass action lawsuit against the USA\n\nRevolution\n\nYou can only hope.\n\nYou’ll never get that so you’ll be waiting forever! lol\n\nWhatever you do, do not pre order. We should have learned the lesson with cyberpunk. \n\nAlso this is coming for PS6 at best lmao\n\nPS6 end of cycle at that. Stable play will happen during the PS7 era.\n\nSee you in 10 years\n\nDoubt it will be that bad. The cinematic for Cyberpunk came out in 2019 (the 2013 one was more of a concept teaser), so this shouldn't be much more than a couple of years away.\n\nCyberpunk's cycle is complete and they announced that TW4 went into full production not that long ago.\n\nAnd it's using a much more approachable engine this time around with Unreal. Much easier to hire and bring in contractors for.\n\nMaybe CDPR will be the first company to make an open world UE5 game without massive performance problems...\n\nSatisfactory is a UE5 game with a pretty large map and it is very well optimised. Unreal is sure a mess of very dubiously written code but it can be optimized well, if you want. The problem is that the average studio will just hack up a bunch of blueprint abominations and call it a day, among the other things.\n\nIs unreal making devs lazy ? Or does the engine have problems ?\n\nWhenever something becomes approachable, the level of talent/skill required drops, you end up with more products and, therefore, the average quality level drops.\n\nIt's just a law of nature.\n\nThe engine is immense and full of dubiously written code, but that's definitely not the problem. The issue from my point of view is that \n\n1. UE really doesn't have great documentation, often you have to read the code directly, and some parts are clearly half baked and you kinda have to fix them yourself\n\n2. It tends to heavily push you towards writing blueprints, which are more for prototyping than real code IMHO. It's very hard to maintain blueprints. \n\n3. The engine architecture is inherently single threaded. It's not trivial to scale over multiple cores because (among the many reasons) they use a garbage collector that's not thread safe. This would not be a problem per se - your average game is probably going to be GPU bound anyway - but still it's not ideal\n\n4. The engine was clearly heavily inspired from Java in general, several decades ago. We now know that lots of choices made back then weren't that great\n\nAlso my true 2 cents is that even the stuff above doesn't really matter that much. IMHO the problem is that by going to the \"let's aggressively license the engine\" route Epic made it a bit too developer friendly, IMHO, which comes at the expense of code maintainability. Everything is a singleton, you can fetch everything from everywhere, ... This means you can hire less expert people (Devs are always in short supply) and whip up a game even if you don't have enough talent in house. \n\nModern games are way too big, if you code them in a \"let's ship it fast!!\" mode you're gonna end up with a massive pile of shit code. Which may still run OK, sure, but it's impossible to optimise and work with.\n\nIt's great for me as a 3D artist with very little experience in coding but yeah a lot of people lean on the blueprints rather than getting a proper dev on board to iron things out. Historically we could only take things so far without a dev but now you can make a whole game with very little coding which of course was never going to be a optimal approach and it shows in a lot of indie games made by people like me.\n\n[deleted]\n\nThis one looks a lot like a concept teaser to me.\n\nThis looks more in line with The Witcher 3 \"Killing Monsters\" CGI video and the vampire one.\n\nYep. I felt like I was watching a sequel to it. TW3 released about 2 years after that video came out.\n\nI might be reading too much into it, but I feel like \"No gods, only monsters\" was a callback to it.\n\nAbsolutely a callback. Both are the final line of the trailer.\n\nIt's a running theme throughout the Witcher, in a world with actual monsters the worst monsters of all are humans.\n\nOh, I'm aware :D I have a wolf school medallion tattooed on my arm.\n\nHaha, talk about preaching to the choir!\n\nAlways feel free to preach to me about The Witcher, just because I love it doesn't mean I know everything about it AND I WANNA!\n\n[Compare it with Cyberpunk's 2013 teaser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvVjkqB3LH0) and [2019's cinematic trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LembwKDo1Dk). Today's trailer seems way more in line with the 2019's one and them having entered full production, this is certainly past the conceptual stage of development.\n\nYeah, you don’t get trailers like this without the game being significantly into development, that 2013 cyberpunk trailer was barely even a trailer, it was more of an artistic concept. Plus I’m pretty sure CDPR learnt that lesson pretty hard with cyberpunk but to their credit they did not stop until cyberpunk was fixed.\n\nThis game is not coming out for another four years minimum lmao\n\nAnd i honestly dont mind, i hope they learned their lesson from cyberpunk, i dont care if its gonna take ten years, I love the entire Witcher franchise with all my heart, I will be so terribly sad if a bad launch ruins its reputation\n\nTo be honest, none of CD Projekts games have ever released in a 'great' state at launch. Each Witcher game was a buggy mess on release, that they then fixed over time. Same with Cyberpunk 2077, but that launch was worse due to the game's hype and the company's greed to release it before it was ready. I wouldn't bet on a flawless release for Witcher 4.\n\nWitcher 4 with Elden Ring right after… almost overdosed on peak.\n\nEven Geoff couldnt believe that shit\n\nHalf Life 3 next\n\nAny valve game with a 3 at the end would be peak\n\nThe Elden Ring Co Op game was a big wtf\n\nHuge WTF... I still don't know that the fuck that is, and why it exists.\n\nProbably not being made by the main team?! At least I hope so.\n\nYeah super weird, you drop on a randomized map and survive 3 days, you choose one of 8 hero’s and there is a Fortnite like zone that drives you to a boss fight every night. Sounds weird but this is fromsoft so I will keep an open mind\n\nConfirmed to have no microtransactions and is not directed by Miyazaki.\n\nhe greenlit it and chose the director, though. i’m still excited.\n\nAnd tbh I'd rather it wasn't directed by him. I'd rather his time be spent on something more original. I'm still psyched, but I feel like his talents would be wasted on something like this\n\nI'm actually totally okay with and will buy this if it isn't microtransactioned to hell\n\nWhat... the... fuck!!\n\nWtf..is this a joke ? Need to go check\n\nThey’re releasing a co op survival game next year\n\nI mean the actual co-op mod for Elden Ring is amazing beyond words.\n\nMy guess is that they got influenced by the seamless coop mod and made their own version\n\nLooks like it's a complete spinoff though, with a different gameplay loop\n\nSeriously. What a day. What a lovely day\n\nI busted a nut tbh\n\nI've never been so torqued in my life\n\nhighkey they kinda fked up the hype by doing that\n\nFootage in engine on a GPU nobody has access to.\n\nSo, guess I'll be playing this in 2034.\n\nWitcher 2077\n\nWake the fuck up, samurai... it's time for your pills and diaper change.\n\n \"the red ones stop you from screaming\"\n\nThat GPU is releasing in a month.\n\nI won't be able to afford one with comparable performance for quite some time tho ... unless the market change drastically somehow.\n\nRemember you probably have a minimum of 5 years before this game comes out. Plenty of time for the cutting edge to become yesteryear's tech.\n\nYou will pry my 1080 from my cold dead hands.\n\nat 5x its deserved price\n\nWell, they didn't name it the 5xxx series for nothing..\n\n\"Deserved\" lol\n\nThey’re talking about scalpers obviously\n\nIt's a cinematic trailer. Did you expect them to render it on some second hand mining gpu from ebay?\n\nYeah that part is weird, if it’s a pre-rendered cinematic what difference does it make if it’s rendered on a single unreleased GPU or a whole server farm of GPUs. It would only be relevant if it was being rendered real time in the game. Seems like a pointless flex.\n\nCause Nvidia is going to market their 5090 as \"must buy to play next Witcher game as intended\". Then CDPR will add some AI feature that can only run in Nvidia GPUs like they did with path tracing and Cyberpunk. Nvidia used Cyberpunk as their playground to market ray/path tracing and it absolutely worked for both CDPR and Nvidia.\n\nEdit - Look Nvidia GeForce account on twitter. They are resharing the trailer and promoting witcher. I am both hyped and worried. Hyped that the tech will be amazing but worried that I'm gonna have to sell a kidney to afford a GPU that can run this game with all the shnazzle...\n\nDon't forget Hairworks was a NVIDIA exclusive and did a LOT for Witcher 3\n\nIt does explicitly say it's PRErendered within engine. So could be FMV or rendered albeit below 1min per frame. Marketing jargon is supposed to be deceptive.\n\nInteresting.  So she's not blinking everywhere this time.  And she has witcher powers?  I wanna hear the lore reasons for that, but this has some great potential.  I like older angrier Ciri.  \n\nNote: Love Geralt, but he got a whole trilogy.  Like the fresh start.  If I want to play Geralt, Witcher 3 is still rock solid.\n\nShe got augmentations in Night City\n\nI would love for this to actually be a thing. Mantis Blade comes out if nowhere to save the day.\n\nThe Witcher 2077\n\nYeah,the magic i can understand,but the elixirs and \"cat eyes\"...\n\nEither Ciri went through trial of the grasses as a adult which is borderline impossible or the Lynx school has access to some diffrent method of gaining witcher powers.\n\nShe doesn't have to go through the trial of thr grasses. At least not according to witcher lore (the witchers in the work not the series as a whole.) Geralt tells ciri's grandmother that the witcher lore says the child of Destin will be able to become a witcher without the trial.\n\nAccording to the devs, she has gone through the trials\n\nWell shit, this one snubs doubts pretty quick. So it's already written into the lore of the books that Ciri was always destined to be a Witcher. Whatever the explanation may be, it's got solid justification.\n\nThis might be a stretch, but ciri does have the ability to manipulate time and space. So I wouldn’t be surprised if later on after improving her powers, she discovered the ability to alter her own biochemical structure. Basically giving her the ability to turn herself in to a Witcher without the trial\n\nThe idea that Ciri has God powers and of all things chooses to wallow in the muck as a witcher is fucking hillarious.\n\nShe has daddy issues, okay? Geralt wallowed in muck, so she will too!\n\nDid i ever tell you about that time i hunted a Zeugl.....\n\nIt's easily the best ending though. Fuck all the nonsense, she just wants to be like her dad. Wholesome.\n\nAnd kinda on par with the series, honestly. Being a Witcher itself is trivial since it's a dying tradition and occupation by the time Geralt himself was.\n\nHell or she just straight up went back in time and went through the trial in the past? Seems like a stretch but who knows.\n\nTBH I think the story of Geralt and Ciri reached its end in Witcher 3. I would have much preferred a new game set a couple centuries earlier in the heyday of witchers.\n\nThey probably aren't Witcher powers, but her normal magic. Not sure about the potions though.\n\nAlso in the books Triss' argument about why Ciri shouldn't get the mutation always bugged me. She didn't want her to be deprived of \"womanhood.\" I'd take the three or four centuries of life, myself.\n\nI mean Ciri is already not human in 3 so I'm not sure that she'd even get much use out of the Witcher mutations compared to how much she can already do. They'll probably have to nerf that to make the games make sense.\n\nThat's why they're going to have to do a lot of explaining for this to make sense. On the one hand, Ciri never underwent the trials of the grasses which only boys have ever survived and which have to be undertaken during adolescence, so it doesn't make sense for her to be able to use witcher potions. On the other, Ciri by the end of Witcher 3 is vastly more powerful than a witcher because she can teleport everywhere at will and attack faster than the eye can follow, so undergoing the mutations would be a waste of her time and a pointless risk.\n\nKind of missing the whole point of Yennefer’s story there (her fertility being taken away from her in unbeknownst to her in exchange for magical ability). The same would have happened to Ciri had all that continued, and it’s a really sweet and endearing moment when the 4 men at Kaer Morhen all realize that despite being famed monster hunters and incredibly strong, they are just totally out of their element when it comes to a girl on her period.\n\nThe trial is what allows them to take the potions which are all different mutagens, this is the lore problem. \n\nCiri is arguably more powerful than any Witcher, I'm a bit disappointed that it doesn't seem like they want down the \"elder blood\" thing, could've had very different core mechanics and \"talents\" than what we've had so far in the games.\n\nI'll kill that whole village if they let me\n\nSame.   Then I will loot ALL of their goatskins and dolls, and trade them for useless gwent cards I already have, which I will drop in the ocean.\n\nThen I will play Gwent\n\nNot just the men...\n\nSo, my question is, did they tweak her with more wither modifications? According to the books, girls cannot survive the trials of grasses and she is ingesting a potion to get those eyes. \n\nI wonder if they subjected her to further grasses trials even though most of those mages are dead.\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if they retcon that or just hand wave it by saying her \"chosen one\" powers let her complete the trial.\n\nIt'll probably be they believed no girls *could* survive the trials, because no girl ever *had*.  \nCiri is not your average girl, let alone average witcher.\n\nReverse Paul Atreides moment\n\nLisa Al'gaib!\n\nYeah, Ciri is already as close to an ultra-powerful divinity as she can be... and that's also my biggest interrogation for this game : how do you raise the stakes to truly challenge a being so powerful without going too overboard with the power creep?\n\nReally curious to see how they'll handle that scenaristically.\n\nMy guess is that they'll find a convenient excuse to lock away (most of) her powers for most of the game\n\nPeople seem to be forgetting that if Ciri survives the White Frost at the end the process of negating it drained her power.\n\nOr you know, just like any medical procedure, someone modified and improved it, it's not a static world where knowledge and tech remain stagnant. Like Spartan IV program in Halo which is much easier on the candidate than the Spartan II program.\n\nCiri was drinking witcher potions as a child in the books, why would she lose the ability to drink them as an adult?\n\nMy biggest problem is not even that, but Ciri was super OP. It's a bit like Superman or Hulk who are basically impossible to kill. I don't see how they can write that out enough to make sense.\n\nGeralt got super buffed in the game. No way he could have gone toe to toe with a vampire in single combat.\n\nIMO game Geralt is as overpowered as lore Ciri, so I don’t think lore Ciri being overpowered is a problem.\n\nHell no. There's a huge difference between what is possibly the strongest Witcher (but still \"just\" a Witcher), and Ciri, who's canonically one of the most powerful beings in the universe.\n\nThere they go again showing the game so early in development. Why don't they play it like Nintendo and show it once it's nearly complete?\n\nBecause shareholders require it. Not kidding\n\nRockstar recently made a statement that constantly teasing a game 15 years away is good for business.\n\nIt is when you only release one game every 15 years.\n\nRockstar prints money with GTA 5, which is great for quarterly earnings reports.. CDPR does not have any IPs that generate constant income like that. Plus Take Two publishes other games as well, not just Rockstar games.\n\nI can't believe people still play it online.. wow.\n\nAlso because it serves to attract new developers to work at the studio\n\nAlso because hype is actually important for businesses.\n\nIf they deliver it or not in the final product is another story\n\nThis and gamers will dickride this to stratospheric hype, so no downsides\n\nBecause this strategy actually works quite well. Cyberpunk had massive hype and over 8 million preorders, the marketing campaign was huge success. Main problem was that they released the game too early.\n\nMain problem was it should have never been released for last gen at the same time as next gen. They should have bit the bullet and said “PS5/XSX/PC gets it now, PS4/XB1 gets it Christmas 2021”\n\nthey did t with BOTW...\n\nI'm more than happy to see trailers early.  It's releasing the *game* early that's the problem.  And even then, not a problem if you're a patient gamer.\n\nI dont understand why that is even a point either way is fine no? Why does it matter just enjoy the cool looking trailer.\n\nMetroid Prime 4 was announced year 1 of the Switch?\n\nI'm actually half surprised Ciri is the protagonist. First of all how is she drinking witcher potions and why isn't she using her godly warp magic to just destroy the monster?\n\nI guess we'll find out. I like Ciri so I'm down for a Ciri adventure if it isn't silly. Kinda a shame though that it apparently makes one ending of 3 noncanon.\n\nIncoming Metal Gear Solid 2 twist. We play as Ciri in the beginning before a new protagonist takes over lol\n\nIncoming MGSV plot twist: &gt;!the protag only thinks she's Ciri.!&lt;\n\nIGN has an article interviewing the developers where they say she did undergo the Trial of Grasses after TW3. I'm gonna assume she lost her powers after stopping the White Frost, gives the player a blank slate kind of approach. Very excited.\n\nLet’s wait until they actually provide review copies for consoles this time\n\nThey should.  They said they're making games for console now instead of PC.\n\nEDIT: That makes me wonder if PC players will be the ones with the shitty game this time lmao\n\nEDIT 2: Apparently that was a misleading article written some time ago.  CDPR simply said they won't make the mistake of testing it on console too late in the development cycle.\n\nThat seems like a horrible decision in an ever growing PC market instead of, you know, just making a competent fucking port or figuring out that this insanely demanding game is not gonna run well on this decade old hardware.    \n  All while they're adapting to a completely new engine to boot, sounds like yet another problem in the making that will bite them in the ass.\n\nPlayable geralt chapters similar to what Ciri had in the Witcher 3 but longer would make a lot of sense for this game\n\nGrape picking and a drinking minigame in Corvo Bianco\n\nITS TIME\n\n... in seven years.\n\nFor the gameplay reveal.\n\nJust don’t make me fight the ancient leshen from Monster Hunter Worlds. Fuck that thing.\n\nThey’re far easier in The Witcher than they are in World\n\nCiri all grown up and actually became the witcheress after W3. She's so badass. \n\nCan't wait for the game, and please don't fumble it CDPR.\n\nIf you fully complete Witcher 3 and get the “good” ending, Geralt tells her father she’s dead and Ciri joins him in the Witcher life.\n\nHow can she handle the potions if she doesn't actually have the witcher mutation?\n\nProbably something to do with her elder blood. She's not exactly human.\n\nThey put the elf dude halfway through the trial in the last game. Maybe they figured out something new from that.\n\nThey have Yeneffer, Triss, geralt and probably the entire lodge of sorceresses helping them advance the chemistry of the trial of grasses. It’s entirely possibly they’ve made it new and better and it now works on adults too. Ciri is building a new wolf school of Witchers. We will probably get to play a created Witcher under her tutelage. That’s why she has been represented older in this game.\n\nI hope this is it. Ciri as a Geralt/Vesemir to the PC would be great. But my guess is she will be the PC, which I will be happy with as well.\n\nPlaying as my own Witcher or playing as older Ciri both sound amazing, it's a win either way.\n\nHere's the thing, Geralt and the Wolf school absolutely hate the Trail of the Grasses and what they went through. They never want anyone to go through it again. Geralt would rather bury the process and have the knowledge of making another witcher lost to time. Only Vesemir kept the equipment for nostalgic purposes and used it only to lift a curse on Uma. \n\nI have a hard time thinking Geralt, Yen, and Triss would agree to having Ciri risk her life. Nah, I think Ciri finds a different Witcher/Witcher school and they have them do it to her.\n\n&gt;How can she handle the potions if she doesn't actually have the witcher mutation?\n\nShe does have the mutations in the trailer, look at her eyes. She got Witcher eyes.\n\nI thought the good ending was she became empress\n\nDepends on what you consider the good ending, there’s 2 “good” ones. \n\nOne if you tell the Emperor that you’ll bring Ciri back to him. In this one she ends up Empress of Nilfgard. \n\nThe other is if you tell him you won’t bring her back to him (or just don’t tell Ciri that you met with him), then she ends up on a Witcher journey with Geralt.\n\nYou can tall her you met up with him and let her decide and she chooses not to see him , I think you can still get her to go but just based off of that the witcher ending always seemed more canon to me. You dint really have to force anything to get it\n\nSadly we are vastly outnumbered. \n\n\nI'll always maintain empress Ciri saves the world far better than witcher Ciri.\n\nThe sad irony of Nilfgard is that while they are absolutely brutal even relative to everyone else, they're also straight up the least ineptly run political entity around. They don't *need* Witchers because unlike the chaotic mess that is the Northern Kingdoms, they largely wiped out their monsters through organized effort.\n\nWitcher Ciri, while the most interesting option in terms of making a sequel, is also a terrible option for the world. It doesn't need a handful of wandering monster hunters, it needs less despotic rulers.\n\nI kind of see it as her choice to live a life for herself, rather than live up to everyone else's expectations.\n\nShe forgot teleportation though.\n\nShe’s just a Witcher. No need to add -ess\n\nFine, il play all of witcher 3 again!\n\nI'm glad that Ciri becoming a Witcher is the Canon Ending. The Empress ending was a bummer.\n\nI think if the characters all got what they wanted, then Ciri and Geralt would continue to be Witchers together.\n\n\nHowever, I did think the Ciri Empress ending was the best conclusion to the game, gave Ciri her own path forward in life, and likely led to the best outcome for everyone in the empire. \n\n[deleted]\n\nEh I think the witcher ending is th characters being more selfish than selfless\n\ni'm excited for lesbian ciri sex scenes\n\n16 times the details\n\nNot sure how I feel about Ciri as the protagonist. On one hand it's great to see her again, on the other was kinda hoping for a fresh start.\n\nI'm excited but sad they went with a different VA....I absolutely love Jo Wyatt and hearing a different voice was so...jarring. I get they probably wanted her to sound older but Wyatt is 54 IRL sooo \n\nCiri probably discovered tobacco\n\nWell, I can understand since we were kinda told ''this will be a new story and a fresh start'' almost saying it wont be called the Witcher 4 at all. So I kinda built my expectations around this idea that I wont be playing Geralt (or Ciri or any other characteres we knew). So I was taken by surprise seeing Ciri in there with The Witcher IV as the name of the game.\n\nSo yea, a part of me was ''disappointed'' seeing Ciri for these specific reasons. BUT, its still a Witcher game and Ciri is awesome so, will still play it and thoroughly enjoy it!:)\n\nshe is kinda OP, her powers are insane but idk\n\n\nedit: Maybe I forgot but others said Ciri gave up her powers for her Getalt and Yen\n\nYeah, I don't mind it being Ciri but by the end of the Witcher 3 she was pretty much a god so I wonder how they'll explain away all that.\n\nShe's Geralt's protégé. If anything it'd be strange if it wasn't her imo.\n\nI was hoping it would be a prequel thing, with the Witchers at the height of their golden age, with all the different schools. And you get to choose an origin school\n\nWitchers of the Old Republic?\n\nYeah I had always said they had two directions to go with a 4th Witcher game. Either its Ciri, or they allow people to 'make your own Witcher'.\n\nWhy did they recast ciri's voice actress? 😡\n\ni loved her old VA, and it's a litle weird hearing someone else, but it's giving the impression that shes much older now, been through some shit, her version of the trial of the grasses maybe messed her up a little. i also blame that for why her space/time powers may be stunted now. she poisoned her elder blood and founded her own witcher school and now she's on a long road to reconnecting with that while also trying to be a decent role model while also dealing with who knows what new horrors.\n\nThe voice change makes her seem much older. Perhaps she is several decades older in this game. \n\nIf that's the case, the voice change makes perfect sense to me.\n\nHearing the new voice is so jarring.. Takes me right out of it.\n\nWhy my Empress out here killing Monsters?\n\nI kind of hoped it would be set back in the golden age of witchers\n\nI'm not familiar with the game story but saw some of the netflix series.\n\nI'm guessing this is Ciri, right?\n\nIsn't she supposed to be like, omega powerful? Would that happen in the game?\n\nLooks like Ciri grown up. They likely will nerf her due to some story explanation or mobs and combat are going to be way more difficult than Witcher 3\n\nThey probably will have some reason why she doesn't have her full powers. She couldn't always control them, and they took a lot from her anyway.\n\nYeah, maybe she lost her powers and gained witcher mutations? \n\nNo idea how she can use the potions.\n\nYeah she was incredibly powerful in the Witcher 3. Be interesting to see how they manage that for an entire game.\n\nYou play as her for a short section in W3 and she’s basically the same as Geralt but with a quick teleport dash instead of a quick dash.\n\nI mean....they used the same 'theme' we associate with Geralt (this dangerous, menacing, brooding figure of immense aptitude and knowledge), but without any of the gravitas brought by his confidence and sluggish pace out of combat...or his gravelly voice. It's a bit jarring.\n\nIf you go with Ciri, just make it in her own flavor. She's graceful, nimble and more....sociable. There's no reason a witcher can't be thematically different than Geralt.\n\nWell, kinda is... As far as I know they kinda get fucked up once they go through the trials. \n\nSome would say that witchers don't even have emotions, which was proven wrong by Geralt, but the level of emotions is pretty much dialed down and you can only see glimpses of it.\n\nDon’t preorder.\n\nWind’s howling\n\nPlease don't be shit.\n\nI was really hoping for a custom witcher. One where you could choose your school and get unique dialogue and story for each. I felt the missions using Ciri in witcher 3 were flat and dull compared to the dodging and parrying excitement with geralt. They'll probably add some good combat mechanics but it just feels off without a true witcher mutations. I'm sure it will still be great, but I had other expectations."

I don't have PS plus in any form but I bought Fallout 4 digitally for PS4 from the PSN online store (full price when it came out).  Can I get the PS5 update for free?\n\nYeah you can, this problem is with PS Plus Essential right now. Sorry for not clarifying\n\nIt works for everyone but people who got the \"welcome to ps5\" ps plus catalogue pack back in the day. Which now involves a giant middle finger.\n\nIs that being patched as well?\nI had the disc version on ps4 and that’s long since gone. I think I got that version you’re talking about. Does that not include the upgrade?\n\nWhat problem? I downloaded the PS5 version of Fallout 4 this morning and I've only got Essential. Works fine.\n\nIf you got Fallout 4 through your PS Plus Extra subscription instead of buying it, you don’t get access to the PS5 version and instead have to pay 27 CAD to upgrade it.\n\nThat was patched yesterday, it’s free now\n\nIdk what's happening, but after it was \"patched\", it was still asking me to pay until I checked again a few hours later. So I wouldn't be surprised if it's still not fixed for some people.\n\nWeird. I have the PS Plus version and downloaded the PS5 update just fine. I’ve played for about 4 hours now\n\nDo you mean you have the higher tier subscription that gives access to the library that contains FO4, or do you have the lowest tier sub and added the game to your own library when it was a monthly game? \n\n\nBecause that's where the distinction lies. I have the lowest tier sub and game through that (6 months ago? Dunno), and I cannot download the PS5 version\n\nEdit: it was from the PS5 game collection, not a monthly game sorry\n\nI had the digital ps+ free monthly game version of FO4 installed and am at the essential (1st) tier. I could not see nor download the ps5 version although all of the ps5/ps4 dlc was available for free and I was able to download it. \n\nI deleted the ps+ digital version and installed from my disk and it then allowed me the free ps5 upgrade, if you have that option try that.\n\nDidn’t they fix it?\n\nThey fixed it in the sense that they are re-re-clarifying that it is not available for PS Plus Essentials owners. After they re-clarified that it was for PS Plus Essential owners.\n\ni'm at a loss, can you not get for free if you got through PS+ or what? a lot of conflicting comments in this thread\n\nYeah someone explained it to me after. That’s so shitty\n\nSo its Sony's problem not Bethesda's?\n\nBethesda probably should have foreseen it but it was an issue with how Sony deals with multiple versions of games.\n\nYes. If you bought the game, you have access and everything should be fine. Disc and digital, both work. (If you have it on disc, insert the disc and you should see the free upgrade. If you have it digitally, go to your game library and find the game, you should find the free upgrade there.)\n\n\nIt's the PS+ version that gets a bit more confusing as it has been made available on two different places, and the upgrade path is... confusing there.\n\nI have a physical copy which got the update, but none of my dlc is being recognized. The only thing on the store for options is the season pass, $35 USD. Ive already bought the dlc and the game, I shouldnt have to again.\n\nMy answer to everything involving Bethesda is \"the bureaucracy machine\", be it them or dozens of lawyers elsewhere with other corp bureaucracy.\n\nHeck if you told me nuclear war started because of a thousand Bethesda employees not sure exactly what they were aware they were doing I would believe it\n\nThat would be exactly the type of event that fits well in the Fallout universe.\n\nIt sounds like a good fit for a vault that would’ve been in the Fallout Bible\n\nOh god, a Vault where every single social interaction involves exchanging and signing forms and receipts.\n\n[deleted]\n\nIt would end up in some really funny line on a holotape of a guy complaining that he had to sign a Pen Requisition Form, even tho he doesn't have a Pen to sign it (and ends on him getting arrested because he doesn't have a permit to Record Holotapes).\n\nThere’s a certain very palatable irony to needing to fill out and sign a form to obtain a pen. If you don’t have a pen, you can’t fill out the form to get one. If you have one, you don’t need one…\n\nAs the deputy vice pen requisition manager, I approve of this situation.\n\neveryone gets one pen at birth. You are responsible for making sure you can use your existing pen to fill out the requisition form before it runs out of ink.\n\nPen ran out? BANISHED.\n\nCoincidentally I just watched an episode of a British sitcom set in a government office where someone needed to fill out a form to get a pen. He was told to fill it in in pencil because he didn't have a pen, when he said he didn't have a pencil, the supply person gave him another form and walked off.\n\nIn Fallout 2, everything in Vault City is super slow since it's a bureaucratic mess where everything requires forms and approvals. Obviously not as extreme as every social interaction but you get the idea.\n\nAlso the first citizen of vault city is a royal cuntbag.\n\nThis sounds pretty similar to the long term goal of Bud's buds.\n\nBrain on a roomba did say *After* they cleaned the surface.\n\nHere's the receipt for your receipt, now on to the receipt for this sentence\n\nEdit; great now I have to make another receipt for the downvote\n\nEdit: and another for the edit, fuck.\n\nSounds like a company that heard what Vault-Tec was doing, licensed Vault-Tec technology, and put out an inferior product to the originals. \n\nOh hey Bethesda\n\nIt's not bureaucracy; it's \"management\"\n\nAre you one of my bud’s?\n\nThis is basically the plot of Shin Godzilla\n\nIn one of their own in house videos they had no source footage of morrowind. They had to rip someone else's YT video and slap a weird CRT filter on it.\n\nBethesda is actually Vault-Tec? GODDAMN\n\n\"The Lunch Menu. \nThe Lunch Menu never changes.\"\n\nIt’s honestly astonishing that Amazon and Bethesda produced a show that was so overwhelmingly anti-corporate\n\nIf anti-corporate sentiment is profitable then it's a no-brainer. As the saying goes, a capitalist will sell you the rope you hang them with.\n\nI mean these guys are the absolute worst when it comes to monetization of their properties, they resold us basically the exact same game 3 different ways for the past decade, they took modding which has *always* been free and found a way to get people to pay for it, and let’s not forget literally being the people to coin *”microtransactions”* with their infamous horse armor shit that for all intents and purposes kicked off the modern landscape of what’s ruining games nowadays. Bethesda as a company alone is utter shit in my eyes, let alone the quality of their games being in a constant downward spiral slowly chipping away content and getting duller by the hour.\n\n&gt;forget literally being the people to coin ”microtransactions” with their infamous horse armor shit that for all intents and purposes kicked off the modern landscape of what’s ruining games nowadays\n\n The arcade game Double Dragon 3: The Rosetta Stone (1990) was infamous for its use of microtransactions to purchase items in the game. It had shops where players would insert coins into arcade machines to purchase upgrades, power-ups, health, weapons, special moves, and player characters.\n\nMicrotransactions have been a thing longer than Bethesda has been a company.\n\nSeeing as there was no way to make in game purchases on the NES, is that why the NES port of Double Dragon 3 felt so difficult? That would explain why there was no way to refill health or the special meter unless I'm an idiot and there was some sort of shop in the game that I some how missed at the time.\n\nI also think Korean MMOs/f2p games with their cash shops were out before the horse armor. Nexon was basically the precursor to the current mobile market lol\n\nPeople also forget valve and tf2s lootboxes, which was clearly inspired by asian market games and not horse armor, they just combined strategies.\n\nHorse armor was significant because it was one of the first microtransactions in a AAA single player game. The feeling was less, \"what is this terrible new thing?!\" and more \"so it has finally come to this\". It was also the first sign of Bethesda getting aggressive with profits. Up until then they had a really good reputation with DLC content.\n\nDon't forget browser games in early 2000s. That shit was crazy p2w bullshit that's kinda forgotten by most.\n\nThose games are unfortunately still around, they just migrated to mobile instead\n\nAlright and cellphones existed before the 00s\n\nThe first handheld cellular mobile phone was demonstrated by John F. Mitchell and Martin Cooper of Motorola in 1973 so yes, yes they did.\n\nYeah right and airplanes existed before my flight last week.\n\nTodd Howard has single handedly ruined the game industry lol\n\nDon't forget Gabe N. and the TF2 hats and CS:GO skins.\n\nTF2 is the OG when it comes to lootboxes\n\nThe first explosion happened in 2034 when Bethesda devs tried to squeeze even more life out of the creation engine\n\nMaybe Vault Tec is Bethesda \n\nThey are the Stars of the field\n\nIt's a jab at the Escape From Tarkov devs lol\n\nI’m still calling that Nikita just doesn’t give a shit anymore. He *was* super passionate about the game when he was younger/nerdier. Now he’s gotten a taste of the millionaire lifestyle, doesn’t give a flying fuck and wants to make one last cash grab before he bails\n\n100% this. People are naive for thinking otherwise.\n\nPeople still on that sub imploring him to fix the game instead of releasing this version.\n\nTarkov players have a unique stolkholm syndrome variant that needs to be studied.\n\nIt's moderately understandable, not many other games has given me the simultaneous rush and anxiety like Tarkov did and it might be some time before something new arrives to take its place.\n\nThat being said, I could never remotely support Nikita's choices, the people that do are probably coping so they don't have to give up a game they're so passionate about.\n\nWell maybe I've just had the game for too long but.... It's obvious they're not fixing the game. \n\nHas been for a long time.\n\nOh yeah, there's no hope unfortunately. Mainly just reminiscing of a better time.\n\n&gt; not many other games has given me the simultaneous rush and anxiety like Tarkov did and it might be some time before something new arrives to take its place.\n\nI've seen many variations on this opinion since this whole debacle started. Can you describe what exactly Tarkov does that's so cool? The clips I've seen of it don't really convey anything except \"janky multiplayer shooter where you die fast, probably to a cheater.\" What is the nature of this special thing that it does?\n\nThe rush comes a lot from gear/loot fear and getting into a fight vs (legit) players. Also a major commitment of time doing quests (a high amount are if you do x quest but die in that run, you have to redo said quest). There is a massive cheating problem, but when it wasn't so rampant the game was really fun. \n\nThe anxiety part is mostly playing solo, you gotta stay on your toes, and listen in as best you can for footsteps - which can and will trigger a bunch of jump scares.\n\nIt's something you'd have to experience, clips won't quite do it justice, and you'd have to be a fan of the type of gameplay to understand.\n\nmore then once I've dropped prone and waited in dark corner for half an hour watching a single angle expecting someone too come around any second because i made a sound i didn't expect stepping on a different material or an echo. This is what tarkov does too your brain.\n\nTarkov, on any given part, isn't that great. Arma is a better Mil-Sim. Fortnite is a better Battle Royale. Borderlands is a better Looter Shooter. Etc.\n\nBut Tarkov is all of these genres, using the strong points of each one to feed into each other in a fairly unique experience. You get the happy chemicals of finding rare loot, the anxiety that you could lose it all to a single mistake, and fights happen *anywhere, anytime, and without warning*.\n\nPart of the reason clips can never do the game justice is because you didn't experience the past 5 minutes of absolute eerie silence that built the tension and anxiety that explodes into an adrenaline rush when a fight breaks out.\n\nIf that doesn't sound appealing to you... then fair enough. It's not for everyone.\n\n&gt;Tarkov players have a unique stolkholm syndrome variant that needs to be studied.\n\nNot unique.  Nintendo fans (myself included) suffer from the exact same phenomena.\n\nIt's a fun game and there are zero alternatives.\n\nWhat else are they supposed to do?\n\nGray Zone, Beautiful Light, Project l33t, Arena unlimited or w/e\n\nHopefully, at least one of these games isn't a scam. \n\nAlso, I've never really cared what other people have in Tarkov because the whole point is I can kill them and take it.  I'd be fine if BSG just started selling gear themselves, I'm not gonna buy it but I would laugh whenever I killed a slicky altyn timmy.\n\nSadly they opted for a priority queue and gameplay advantages like scavs not shooting you from more than 60 meters away.\n\nHe was a pretty shady guy before that as well, giving a presentation about how you can use the word 'beta' to shield your game from criticism, but that it wouldn't work for a long time..\n\nDude bought war materiel for Russian soldiers in Ukraine. The barrier of fucks was always quite low\n\nHe did ?\n\nTarkov is affiliated with a Russian-oriented war media group 715, they get mentions in the game like \"Train Hard\". A part of 715 activity is spreading Pro-Russian propaganda and interviewing soldiers and \"separatists\" in Donetsk, and on more than one occasion brought them gear and magazines. \n\nLet's also talk about proposing the trader named \"Khokhol\" which is an ethnic slur for Ukrainians. Tarkov devs are staunchly Pro-Russian to the point of promoting the destruction of a neighboring country. \n\nThere's no reason to support these bastards.\n\nTrue, having done my own research a while ago. Well said. I can't see any reference to this trader though.\n\nit was a proposal from around a year ago. I don't think they ever implemented him. \n\nThe ethnic slur comes from a traditional Ukrainian Cossack shaved haircut like a mohawk with a tail or topknot. You see depictions of that haircut from the famous painting [Reply of the Zaporozhian Cossacks](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/79/Ilja_Jefimowitsch_Repin_-_Reply_of_the_Zaporozhian_Cossacks_-_Yorck.jpg)\n\nHis response to the community is laughable. Wish I could get a refund.\n\n[deleted]\n\nWhat’d they do this time?\n\nPut out a new version of the game for $250 with a new offline mode. Anyone who bought the $150 version (which said it will come with all future dlc) earlier will not get the new \"features\" as they don't count the new mode as dlc.\n\n&gt; they don’t count the new mode as dlc\n\nGlad to see devs going back to mailing CDs out! Oh wait, they are just lying.\n\nNo way grandpa, we're in the future now, they're going to mail us USBs instead.\n\nPeople who bought the most expensive edition years ago which said specifically you get all dlcs for free were scammed and told they are freeloaders and not “true believers”. They also then updated the website to remove the line that says EOD gets all dlcs for free and then when commenting on this change they flat out said they did not change it. And yet a streamer was live looking at the website and then refreshed and it was gone. You can still use the archive feature to see it there. They also admitted that the addition is a DLC but that this DLC is not included in the EOD all players get the DLCs for free…\n\nNikita is a fucking scumbag and I hope those in the UK where they are registered sue there fucking asses into oblivion for false advertising.\n\nNot only that but they only had what was it 1 or 2 dlc before this update so its not like they were releasing very much dlc before this.\n\nIsn’t this illegal? False advertising or some shit?\n\nBattlestate Games is a Russian game development studio based out of Saint Petersburg. You think the Russian legal system is going to do anything about it, especially when the owner is incredibly pro Russian military? \n\nProbably not then, lol. I never got in Tarkov, so I actually wasn’t aware of where they were based. That fucking sucks though.\n\nIt does, Nikita has always been a douchebag, but this move, what a total cunt. \n\nThey also straight up tried to hide that they said it originally by removing that portion from the details page, retroactively. People found it on the Wayback machine just to show that they’re being extremely shady.\n\nto be fair, you made a mistake the second you've spent 150 dollars on a game..\n\nI spent 40 on the base game for a whole wipe that I spent 400 hours on and bought eod after and have put thousands of hours into the game. It’s well worth it for me. The “Unheard” of edition is a straight slap to anyone’s face. EOD wasn’t a mistake in my opinion, this absolutely is.\n\nIt is a mistake unless you play as much as in your case, my most played game has 700 something hours over 5 years, which is rookie numbers, so if a person plays in small bursts lasting a week, it certainly is a huge mistake \n\nBut that shit Nikita pulled is some top tier scam\n\nYou can still play that much without spending any of the extra money. Spending that much for the DLC of a game that was in beta, and has been in beta for 8 years now, is very much a mistake in my eyes. BSG thought they could get away with this for a reason.\n\nPeople like you buying EOD is exactly why the devs thought this new version was a good idea.\n\nOh so like when fallout 4 came out and the season pass said it will include all future dlc and then they said that creation club content wasn't dlc\n\nGame hack! Make your own players create DLC for you and charge extra for it!\n\nTbh that argument has more of a leg to stand on than the EFT devs one (\"It's not DLC, it's additional content you download\")\n\nThe difference is, no one should care about the Creation Club content. Well, on PC anyway\n\nThey also said pvE was a unique feature lmao\n\nI wanted to play EFT but I'm not good enough to play and I dislike the exit campers, I wish they had a single player/coop mode, if that was the case I'd have bought it, but I can barley even justify 50 on a game, let alone 250\n\nSPTarkov is pretty good, worth checking out\n\nHonestly in the hundreds of hours I put into the game I think I can o ly remember a single time I was camped at an exfil. I know it happens but I don't think it's enough to not play it. The reason not to play it is because of how shady the devs are.\n\nIt’s a ruZZian company, surprised that people are surprised lol\n\n[Link for eod owners who would rather spend that money sending a message](https://signmyrocket.com)\n\nmade a new pay to win pack for $250 and scamming people, all while nikita basically tells us to suck it\n\nAlso since no one mentioned it, the jab is that BSG went back and edited their previous most expensive version of the game and they removed the word \"Unique\" from unique secure container and where it said \"Free access to all subsequent DLC: Such as Tarkov Arena\" they removed the part about Tarkov Arena.\n\nThey are trying scam their player base.\n\nThey just introduced a pay to win pack\n\nThat's putting it lightly lol\n\nWell that sucks. Didn’t think they could make the game worse than it already is\n\n[deleted]\n\nAt least we didn't have to pay $250 for it\n\nReminds me of when Blizzard removed the \"all items can be purchased with the same currency\" from the Overwatch page, when they started making seasonal currency.\n\nYep and I sit with 256k of the old currency that is useless now, another reason of why I stopped playing OW after 7 years of loyal service. Blizz really knows how to bend their playerbase over and give it to them dry.\n\nEvery once in a while I get nostalgic and want to play WoW again. Then I remember that time I got nerfed 40% overall DPS in a patch where they didn't include that change in the patch notes. \n\nI wouldn't say that it's useless.   It's just not 'premium' currency.\n\nBut seriously, 256,000?   What were you waiting for?\n\nIt's useless because I have everything that you can buy with it haha. I wasn't waiting for anything, I owned every single item in OW1 so all my boxes just stacked up for like a year and a half, until the night before OW2 dropped I just opened them all (close to 800 of them) and since I owned every item the game just gives you currency for your doubles. So I ended up with a shit ton of the money you can't buy the new skins with lol. If they ever make the game fun again I'm sure there will be a ton of stuff I can buy now that I've sat out like 4 seasons. I just miss 6v6 cuz I'm a tank player, the game feels too different now, plus I tilt easily so it's better for my sanity to just stay away haha.\n\nI think youre the reason why they changed the system up. They figured after a point, they cant get any real money from you anymore\n\nim in this boat. ive been using them to buy the recolors and epics of ow2 heroes as they come out. there seem to be a few for each new character and some emotes you can buy. \n\nwhat sucks now is it seems new heroes are coming out with almost no base skins on release.\n\nThey did a rebrand to cover all of this, they also said all heroes will be unlocked for everyone back in OW1 days.\n\nNikita is that you?\n\nfly amusing consider reminiscent air physical handle edge secretive crowd\n\nThey are free tho? What's the complaint here? That they removed some words? \n\n\nAll of these, at least for me, are downloaded by default when you download the updated version of the game. They were automatically installed when I started the game.\n\nNot free for people who got it on what is now PS Plus Essential (or the PS Plus Collection). \n\n\nThat has now been recategorised as the PS4 version and you have to buy the PS4 and PS5 version for £15.99. Extra annoyance is that 1 day before the patch dropped it was on sale, but you couldn’t buy it as ‘you already owned’ this game. \n\n\nPeople who have managed to download the PS5 version have at least PS Plus Extra as it’s included there, and the Extra license obviously overrides the Essential one.\n\nThis is a common misconception unless I'm missing something. I have bought games that I owned on PS Plus already. You just have to choose the 3 dots and then choose the paid for option to buy it. I did this with Snow runner and bought it before it left my subscription and it still works now\n\nNo, the point is it was advertised as free for everybody, except it's not free for the players that got it through ps+ essential\n\nIf we want the update, we have to pay for it\n\nThere have been 2-3 articles in the last 24 hours about this. It's a known issue they're looking into, and should be fixed soon.\n\nThats Sony. They've done this exact thing with other titles before.\n\nI have the PS Essential fallout 4 ps5 edition lol. It works\n\nit was a glitch all of it is free\n\nThe subreddit needs something to circlejerk about. It's free karma. \n\nOP even admits it's not something Bethesda is doing intentionally. So he literally just made this post to ride the circlejerk.\n\nSame. I just downloaded the PS5 version from PS+ last night and all the CC stuff is in there. I got like six quest notifications as soon as I left the vault. OP is just trying to stir up drama.\n\nThere is actually an issue atm where people who got the game for free when the PS5 released have to pay full price to download tne PS5 ver. despite the store saying you own both already, not everything is just drama alert please get over yourself.\n\nBlame Sony. Their platform requires PS4 and PS5 games to be separate SKUs so their PS5 native game didn't get a free update unless Sony adds it to their PS+ lineup\n\nBethesda can still give it to the people that got it through Essential just like they are giving it to people who have Extra.\n\nSquare did it with FFVII Remake... Just a bit later\n\nI’m sorry, but this double SKU-Shit from Sony with PS 4 and PS5 is just ridiculous.\n\nI just downloaded F4 on my Series X and it automatically was the correct version. \nTalking about user experience here.\n\nI'm so confused. Surely a next gen update should only apply to PS5 versions?\n\nThis is a Sony issue.\n\n Yeah, you never know what surprises they've got hidden up their virtual sleeves!\n\nEssentially if you have PS+ Collection version of fallout you're fucked\n\nAnyone remember when they first introduced the creators club and it caused such a massive stir, they backpeddaled the system out of existence, only to bring it back a year later with slightly less egregious terms? Anyone remember why we didn't riot a second time?\n\nBecause calling Creation Club 'paid mods' is mostly inaccurate; what it basically was was outsourcing small DLCs to prominent modders.\n\nThe original system was terribly designed, terribly implemented, terribly policed, and terribly came out of nowhere; just all of a sudden 'hey you can charge for mods now'. People were literally stealing mods, or charging for mods that integrated community-contributed assets and not compensating the person who created those assets.\n\nThe new system remains to be seen.\n\n&gt;with slightly less egregious terms?\n\nBecause of this\n\nAlso they probably didn't care that people were upset bc it's ultimately just an annoyance and didn't meaningfully change how modding worked. It also brought mods to console which was actually a benefit\n\nSo I've always played completely vanilla FO4 on this character. After the update I'm getting large red squares with a white exclamation mark on it on some quest items it seems like. I have the new Xbox\n\nThey trying to pull Escape from Tarkov recent fiasko\n\nPeople who claim they got the game for free with ONLY PS+ Essential already had the game prior to being added to PS+ Collection. It costs $20 for anyone who got it from PS+ Collection and they were unable to buy it when it was $5 without going through weird methods, and who would buy something they already “owned”?\n\nI want to make a post about how if you have Fallout 4 redeemed from the Ps plus collection, it shows up as “Fallout 4 PS4 &amp; PS5 +Installed” on the product page when you select version, but you still can’t redeem the Ps5 download for free. Automod deleted my post because I don’t have enough comment Karma to make a post in this sub yet I guess :/\n\nYou've been tarkov'd lol\n\nFree for all players!*\n\n*Most players\n\n17x times more free!\n\nI assume it's because of the PS Bullshit, so they removed it so that nobody can go ahead and sue them...\n\nIt's just legal stuff and perfectly fine.\n\n[deleted]\n\ndon't know why OP is getting downvoted here and there.\n\nit's actually pretty simple. they said and I quote: \"free for all players\". that means if you own the game when it was in the ps5 collection, free for you. which is not the case now.\n\nfor those who say yes it's free, restore licences, etc, it's ONLY if you have a playstation plus extra acount. if you have the basic playstation plus essential account and OWN fallout 4, you have to pay 20 bucks to get the upgrade.\n\nI have FO4 on disc.\nIs it free for me?\n\nYes, you just have to have the disc inserted and find the update in the playstation store and it will say $0. I think all this hubbub is about people who never purchased it either digitally or physically and instead have access to it through the weird special PS plus categories like essentials and whatever. Seems more like a playstation issue than an evil Bethesda issue.\n\nWait, I have the most basic PS subscription, I own FO4 on PS4, and I did NOT have to pay $20 to upgrade.\n\ndid you get fallout 4 with the ps5 collection or did you buy the game ? maybe if you bought it that's why you didn't have to pay to upgrade. \n\nbut in either cases, that doesn't change the fact that \"free for ALL players\" means what it means.\n\nOhhhh I see what you’re saying. Since they removed that “essentials collection” or whatever, I totally forgot it existed. I *did* purchase FO4 for full price at launch, so that makes more sense.\n\nyep, it's only players who own fallout 4 (didnt buy it because, well, it was free to add in the collection) from the PS5 collection and are ps plus essential users that have to pay 20 bucks to get the upgrade. which kinda sucks because bethesda did say \"all players\".\n\ni hope they'll fix / find a way with sony though :)\n\nI don’t really mind the downvotes that much, all I wanna do is play the upgraded version of the game but can’t. That sucks\n\nXbox user here I did got them for free but got like 8 quest because of the other two freebies.\n\nIf you own the game through the PS Plus Collection or Essential Monthly. The upgrade is not available for free.\n\nYou can only upgrade if you currently have PS Extra or above or if you already owned the \"Paid\" Full-game.\n\nFallout 4 was $5 couple weeks ago. It’s $20 now on psn store\n\nI think I got the enclave armor mod for free but I haven’t done it yet. But it shows as a quest\n\nFallout 76 just got 1 mil new players\n\nI’m sure legally someone immediately began arguing “free for all players? Then you don’t mind if I take the free content packs but don’t update to the next-Gen, right? Why not hys make them free in the creation club? Bethesda don’t make me updateeeee”\n\nAnd so their legal team suggested they change it.\n\nIt's always free on the high seas\n\nTo be completely honest I thought once MS bought Bethesda they'd improve, before that I'd heard all the awful, anti-consumer, shit they'd done was to boost their profile and make them seem more profitable to prospective buyers.\n\nNow I'm thinking they're just striaghtup bad.\n\nThat is the $250 true believer one...\n\nThey pulled a battlestategames"

    "all_comment_text": "I remember at a panel when this was news either Burnie Burns or Gus Sorola of Rooster Teeth basically said that if a kid is smart enough to download the GTA Hot Coffee mod, mod their PS2 and install it they are probably smart enough to go to Google and type in 'titties'.\n\nThat totally sounds like something Gus would say lol\n\nIt is 100% a gusism.\n\nRIP Rooster Teeth.\n\nIt's such a shame they became so corporate and bled so much talent.\n\nI think I stopped watching anything they did after Monty Oums death. RIP Monty.\n\nI've been watching some old podcasts and some with Monty on it. Man, let's just say, if we live in a simulation, the foreshadowing was there. They're constantly talking about accidentally killing him because of his allergies.    \n\nHe was about to sit on that chattering teeth chair they had. But he didn't want to do it because there was cat hair on it from Joe the Cat. I think it was Gus that said something like, \"Yeah, we almost killed Monty.\" And then Monty opens the podcast where they talked about RWBY talking about how he's going to die or something. Really eerie in hindsight.\n\nOh man that is truly eerie. There is something to humans having weakness that we’re cognizant of - Monty with Allergies, those that struggle with addiction, etc. I myself have a bad knee from playing sports decades ago.\n\nAnd we turn those weaknesses into dark comedy for laughs. I’ve personally joked about how I may try to cross the street one day, me knee gives out and I die. Sounds like Monty did the same with his allergies.\n\nIt’s only when that dark humor turns to reality that it seems to cross that line into eerie territory. \n\nBut it’s a damn shame to see truly gifted ones leave us too early. I’m sure he’d have made some insane stuff with the Overwatch models.\n\nTo be fair, you didn't have to mod anything on PS2. It was just a simple gameshark code that unlocked the content. It already existed on the disc.\n\nit's sometimes surprising what those rating boards are missing. reminds of of the original fable, where one of the stistics in the menu was your record for the longest distance you've kicked a chicken. I was double  surprised when I noticed that a) you could behead human enemies in a game recommended for players age 12 and older and b) you could kick the heads around which counted as chickens for your statistics.\n\nAh fable, no other game can I kick a chicken across a town, then let out a nice long shart in front of everyone. Then marry the one person not disgusted.\n\nFable: Behead the chickens and kick them like soccer balls. Don’t worry, we’ll keep track.\n\nSkyrim: You accidentally hurt a chicken? Now the whole town wants you dead and you’re going to prison for a long long time.\n\nZelda: You hurt a chicken?!? Ooh boy get ready for the gates of chicken hell to open beneath you...\n\nTfw you kick a severed head so hard it becomes a chicken\n\nDiogenes at it again.\n\nFable has an M rating.\n\n&gt; you could behead human enemies in a game recommended for players age 12\n\nit was definitely not recommended for players age 12.\n\nA game cleared rated not suitable for children in the first place.\n\n[removed]\n\nMass Effect was getting flak for having sex scenes and romance routes\n\nShout out to Morrigan in Origins putting a bra on literally only to sleep with the Warden lmao\n\n\"let me slip into something more modest before we bone\"\n\nah yes before we dry humping\n\nShe is the reason I'm into goth girls.\n\nImagine it not being Lulu from FFX. Those animators put so much effort into them tig ol' bitties for a game in 2001.\n\nAnd because of her I romanced Shadowheart\n\nPs. Morrigan also caused me to romance Yen from the Witcher. She fucked up my brain chemistry 😂\n\nSounds like she mostly fixed your brain chemistry.\n\nShart doesn’t really belong in the same category for me though.  She looks the part but I haven’t seen her be anything but nice and confused why she likes being nice.\n\nHer robes were way more revealing than that bra lol. I guess that and her sassiness is why she’s so popular.\n\nYeah, I remember BioWare sex scenes being regarded as quite controversial. Especially because they included homosexual romance options too.\n\nIt’s the reason why all non-heterosexual options are just side characters and not your companions (with the only exception being Liara, and only because they used the caveat of „Asari are all female and they can mate with anyone”). \n\nThat’s how controversial it was at the time. They were actually somewhat of a pioneer in normalizing sex scenes in video games.\n\nEDIT: Completely forgot about Kaidan, but yeah, he was retconned into being bi and it happened in ME3 when it was already pretty much acceptable\n\nDragon Age had the same sex options that I remember causing outrage.\n\nYes, Origins had Leliana and Zevran as companions who would get with anyone while Alistair and Morrigan were straight. DA2 which came out a year and a half later, everyone except Sébastien was bisexual. Really stirred up some stuff.\n\nWhat caused more frustration than anything was Anders taking any dialogue option other than the harshest possible form of NO GO AWAY as \"let's start fucking\". This combined with the rather vague dialogue wheel (a change that everyone hated) led to a lot of people trying to comfort their friend only to end up *too* comfortable.\n\nI still think Dragon Age: Origins is the pinnacle of 3D CRPGs. BG3 was great in a lot of ways, but it doesn't have nearly the amount of choice or meaningfully divergent outcomes as DA:O. The fact that DA2 and Inquisition were so lackluster in comparison is an eternal disappointment.\n\nI still say it Dragon Age 2 had been completed instead of being released in an obvious beta state, it could have been the best in the franchise.\n\nThe Fox News interview with Geoff Keeley where he's defending the title is a great watch.\n\nSay what you want about the man, he’s not the worst person in the industry.\n\nMy god he eviscerated them\n\n[Here's one ](https://youtu.be/e6NF6btXCGM)\n\nJack's same-sex romance was cut from ME2 directly because of the outrage over Mass Effect 1 being a \"gay alien sex simulator\" and I'm still big mad about it.\n\nThey even left in the story about how she was in a relationship with this dude and other girl but wouldn't let femshep go for it.\n\nJacob too. His romance with male shep was fully animated (apparently heavily influenced by brokeback mountain) but was cut for the same reason as Jack’s. Honestly it’s not the biggest loss because you know… it’s Jacob, but still, lame that his and Jack’s romances were cut for dumb reasons.\n\njacob would've abandoned male shep for some woman on noveria anyways\n\nI mean, even if it is a gay alien sex simulator, sign me the fuck up. \n\n&gt;It’s the reason why all non-heterosexual options are just side characters and not your companions\n\nOnly in Mass Effect 1 and 2. Every DA game had non-heterosexual romances with fully fledged companions, and ME3 retconned Kaidan into being bisexual. \n\nKOTOR also had a same sex romance for female player characters with Juhani, which, fun fact was also the first openly gay character in Star Wars as well. It's actually kinda crazy how much that slipped under the radar back then. Though I imagine that a male gay relationship would have cause quite a bit more outrage.\n\nOh yeah, I didn’t even know about Juhani being a female romance option until a few weeks ago\n\nMaleShep didn't even have gay romance options until 3, but Kaidan was a squaddie.\n\nThe funny thing is that the scenes are incredibly tame. After ME1 they didn't even show any nudity.\n\nWhich is a real shame. In Andromeda they were OK with nudity and we have scenes with some in it but part of me hoped the Legendary remaster could've been a chance to redo the romance scenes in the trilogy but nope. I just wish the OG squad got their shot at proper nudity rather than the network TV \"cleverly hide everything\" and \"they're wearing underwear\" way.\n\nIt will never not be stupid to me that in Mass Effect 3, Traynor is wearing underwear in the shower.\n\nAll this because of idiot parents who don't check ratings.\n\nOh just wait until you see all the movies with sex scenes in them! Though somehow this is totally acceptable.\n\n[deleted]\n\n*titty \n\nIt was just the one titty. What I found outrageous about it was that the titty was still covered by a comically large pasty. Like, if you’re gonna show some titty, *show som g’dam titty*. \n\nPeople joke and act like this is all over, while right now they are planning to ban porn and arrest anybody who made it if they get into power again, on page 5 of their roadmap for the next R president:\n\n&gt; “Pornography should be outlawed. The people who produce and distribute it should be imprisoned. Educators and public librarians who purvey it should be classed as registered sex offenders. And telecommunications and technology firms that facilitate its spread should be shuttered.”\n\n- Project 2025 Page 5\n\nConservatives also increasingly define homosexuality and transsexuality as 'pornographic' and say they are protecting kids from porn.\n\nPeople swore that they'd never undo abortion rights, etc. People think once something is gained it is there forever and doesn't have to be defended.\n\n\"I'm fairly sure if they took porn off the Internet there would only be one website left and it'd be called *Bring back the porn*\" - Perry's perspective\n\nBasically everything they don't like that involves bodies is pornographic.\n\nAnything involving learning how to have good sex? Pornographic. Sex Ed? Smut. Books talking about what to expect from puberty? Porn. Websites explaining how to use birth control? Indecent filth. \n\nResources for kids to learn what behaviors are *actually* grooming? Obscenity! Oh Lord, let's leave you with Youth Pastor Grabby McFeely, so he can explain it all to you.\n\nThese people don't want holiness, they want control. They don't want to keep kids safe, they want them to have no choice. They don't give a damn about modesty, they just want someone to look down on.\n\nIt's despicable.\n\nSorry, I laughed way too hard at Youth Pastor Grabby McFeely. But in all seriousness, you are right. When you have less information you have less choices and that's not an accident.\n\nWe'll bang, ok?\n\nGotta love that several homosexual options were removed from the games to avoid backlash because Fox News went all in on saying there were \"graphic sex scenes\" and called it an \"alien sex simulator\".\n\nAnd then you play the game and the \"graphic sex scenes\" is some suggestive crawling, a fade to black, and cuddling. Oh and it happens once per game if you go out of your way to romance someone.\n\nThankfully in ME1 at least, the voice lines for both Shepards are still in the game so modders were able to restore the homosexual options.\n\n[deleted]\n\nMass effect got dragged across fox News because of a lesbian kiss.  I remember telling my parents the news reporter was full of crap by calling it a porn simulator.\n\n\nI think they'd even seen me playing it in the living room and talked about how good video games were looking. \n\n\nConservative media just kinda sucks\n\nAnd said hot coffee thing was unused content players normally couldn’t access. Just something left in the game’s files that wasn’t deleted. so its just stupid that it caused just a controversy and got slapped with an unnecessary AO rating\n\nIIRC thats what got Oblivion reclassed from T to M too\n\nWell sort of. It's what got the ESRB to take a second look at the game and find that some of its more graphic aspects might've been overlooked originally. One thing the ESRB brought up was that they were not made privy to the level of gore involved in the Dark Brotherhood questline.\n\nYup. That's the only reason why Oblivion got changed cause of the Lucien Lechance scene.\n\nAnd the severed head of mother apparently was also an issue with the esrb at the time\n\nIt was also the heads on spikes with cracked open skulls, mostly seen at Kvatch.\n\n~~Pretty sure they liked the free press.~~\n\nThey did not.\n\nRockstar is still pissed about it. They have a bad relationship with the modding community 20 years later still and rarely allow any mods on their games because of the fact the original hot coffee content was discovered by modders. \n\n&gt;\tRockstar is still pissed about it.\n\nSam Houser* is still pissed about it.\n\n&gt;Rockstar is still pissed about it.\n\nGuess we'll just piss on them to cool them down.\n\nOh hi, Running With Scissors! How's the next Postal doing?\n\nWell, maybe they should pick up after theirselves. Just saying.\n\nDad still got mad when I found his playboys under his bed. ¯⁠\\⁠_⁠ಠ⁠_⁠ಠ⁠_⁠/⁠¯\n\nThey just hired the FiveM RP server folks so it looks like times may have changed.\n\nbutt wait why would rockstar do something contradictory to what the original commenter said so confidently and stated as if it were a fact\n\nBecause 20yrs have passed.\n\nBut wasn’t it literally just a simple console command to activate it? Somebody looking through the game files would have discovered it eventually, modders or not.\n\nYou could activate it in the PS2 version with GameShark codes. You need the older versions of San Andreas to do it, they pulled it from shelves and shipped out new ones that didn't have any of the content on the disk.\n\nthey've eased up on it. they literally bought FiveM so they can officially support it probably for GTA6 Online.\n\nFiveM can have 100+ players no problem now. so if Rockstar can get it working on consoles too, GTA online could probably end up being way bigger than GTA5's version. I mean, it'll probably still be a chaotic mess. who knows if they attempt official roleplaying servers with actual rules and stuff. and proximity chat which would be huge potentially.\n\n&gt;They literally bought FiveM so they can officially support it probably for GTA6 Online\n\nEveryone who keeps saying this is awfully optimistic. They bought talent for sure, people who were intimately familiar with existing systems and could hit the ground running, this used to be an extremely common thing that happened a lot in the early 2000’s. \n\nBut let’s be a bit more pragmatic and understand that this was just that, it was a talent grab, so when GTA6 launches and the online is no more astounding than it was in GTA5 and isn’t anywhere closer to being ‘modder friendly’…. \n\nTemper expectations is all I’m saying, it’s still Rockstar we are talking about here.\n\nMaybe they bought it because they hate it and want to kill it? Every time you type the phrase \"PC mods\" rockstar employees collectively and simultaneously achieve angry half-chubs.\n\nI assure you it was not worth the fallout. I worked for Take-Two/2K at the time, and it caused a lot of problems for a while. The obvious issue was that it cost a lot of money for the product recall, development and overhead, new manufacturing, and redistribution, as well as paying out for the class action lawsuit. Beyond that, we were on Sony's shitlist (and probably Microsoft as well, but I can only attest to our relationship with Sony given the nature of my position) and everything we submitted to them was put under extra scrutiny, costing additional time and money. The ESRB also had to adjust their policies specifically because of the incident, and in turn also put us under additional scrutiny on everything we did, even for the most innocent games we were working on. It also added fuel to Jack Thompson's crusade against video games. Although I believe he had already been disbarred by the time the judgment came down, he still had a lot of influence amongst other anti-obscenity groups and we regularly dealt with protest groups outside our offices.\n\nBasically, it sucked and made our jobs a bit harder.\n\nWow. Jack Thompson, haven't heard that name in a while but he made a lot of noise back in the day. Man was really obsessed on taking down the whole industry\n\nOne can only hope that that decrepit piece of shit looks on in misery every day at what the gaming industry has become as well as the continued thriving of the rap music genre, which he also tried rallying against.\n\nOh, I didn't know it got recalled. (I don't think it was recalled in the EU?)\n\nThat changes things.\n\nInterestingly I can't find much information about how the incident was received in the EU, but it does appear that Australia outright banned sales of GTA:SA after the rating reclassification. It's hard to believe this all went down 15-20 years ago now, but reading through some of these articles is definitely a trip down memory lane of what we had going on internally.\n\nI didn't remember that we were being investigated by the feds, but I do somewhat recall Hillary Clinton being involved with Jack Thompson's campaign, as well as the California-specific attempts to add additional measures to the ESRB rating system. Part of the allure of the ESRB/PEGI is that they're self-governing bodies independent from government regulation, and they are very strict about the ratings they dole out in order to keep it that way. Having official red tape would undoubtedly stifle innovation and creativity within the industry (some countries do have their own sets of laws that dictate further restrictions, and it does have implications on development, oftentimes adding delays to address specific elements, such as Germany not allowing depictions of blood, dead bodies or any Nazi symbolism). That's what made the hot coffee incident such a big deal because it threatened the very fabric of free enterprise for video games at a time when the industry was being scapegoated for school shootings and child violence.\n\nAll of the first party console companies take the ratings systems very seriously. All of them have a full-stop standards requirement against any Adults Only (AO) rated games from being released on their systems. Once the hot coffee mod went mainstream the ESRB had to take a hard stance and slap AO on it given what was at stake in the surrounding political climate at the time. That's what prompted the recall here in the US. I'd be a little surprised if it weren't the same in at least some parts of the EU.\n\nAs I mentioned, the incident essentially forced the ESRB to change their policies, partly in order to keep their status and reputation intact. There was a good 2+ month period following the judgment against us where they put a stop order on all certificates being issued for *everyone*. The first parties will not greenlight publishing without that certificate, so: no ratings, no games. I particularly remember that sucking for my team because we had a backlog of submissions ready to go, and there was a huge bottleneck once they finally resumed.\n\n[removed]\n\nEven worse, Walmart at the time had a \"no mature games\" policy.  Lots of devs specifically dialed back content to avoid an M rating *to cater to Walmart* because not selling your game in Walmart was such a massive loss of sales\n\nActually the reason it got AO had nothing to do with it being a sex scene and everything to do with it being an INTERACTIVE sex thing. \n\nYep. People are forgetting this aspect. It was an explicit sex mini game. Once it becomes interactive, it becomes an AO.\n\nYeah, same with Fahrenheit. Uncut with a 15/16 rating in Europe but got an AO rating in America because the sex scenes have quick time events making them interactive. Ended up getting a cut release as \"The Indigo Prophecy\" tho pretty sure the ESRB have allowed Fahrenheit in recent years.\n\nHow did God of War get away with it? I guess because it's not on screen and just implied?\n\nYeah, could argue that anything could be going on since you don't see it.\n\nThe Hot Coffee files still exist on PS2 copies of San Andreas\n\nWait till this guy hears about leisure suit larry\n\nI only played one of the Leisure Suit Larry games as a teenager but from what I remember it was just a big tease with a lot of innuendo and raunchy humor but nothing actually explicit. Teenage me was...disappointed.\n\n[deleted]\n\n\"sims but with naked women\" pretty sure mods have replaced that now.\n\nHad the old games on DOS. Somehow convinced my parents to buy them for me back then.  The age verification was funny, but god forbid you lose the manual.\n\nLoved Sierra games!  I just remember one answer to the entry quiz was “Spiro Agnew”.\n\nOh another old school gamer who remembers and enjoyed Sierra games! 😂\n\nAnd god, the sheer variety of 320x200 strip poker games.\n\nthat's not big enough for a tit\n\nIt is if you want enough colours on screen to enjoy it.\n\nLSL really doesn't have sex, almost always it's censored, or does for humorous effect. \n\nOn the other hand there's nudity but many games have nudity, a couple boobs doesn't equal AO...\n\nShout out to Witcher 3 and the animator who did the sex scenes who left to do 3d porn!\n\nWtf is that a real story?\n\nYep\n\nWhat's his name/alias? For research purposes, obviously\n\nThat's terrible! Where?\n\nI may have to pick up a copy of BG3 huh\n\nyou get to fuck a bear\n\nallegedly ALLEGEDLY\n\nit wasn't a sick bear\n\nFucking a bear is at least a 5 man job I wager.\n\nIt was a sick bear\n\nTo be fair\n\nTo be fairrr\n\nr/UnexpectedLetterkenny\n\nYer spare parts bud\n\nSpeaking of 5 way, that is an option if you play your cards right.\n\n... wait, really? \n\nI might need to reload my halfling bard. Is there a diving board?\n\nAct 3 you, 2 open minded companions, and 2 brothel workers.\n\nSir, we have it on film.\n\nThe bear is also testifying you had an incestuous foursome not days later. \n\nYour sentence is honor mode. Without barrels.\n\n*(You can make it a fivesome if you bring the right people)*\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/lh2ZP36.png\n\nAllegedlies\n\nHow many peoples would you needs to fuck an ostrich?\n\nTwo, if it was a sick ostrich. Allegedly.\n\nI always seems to finds a letterkenny referance on reddit, and that’s what I appreciates about it\n\n**Bear fucker, so you require assistance!?**\n\nAnd a squid\n\nYou can't fuck a druid in spider form and this still makes me sad\n\nI'm sure NexusMods has something.\n\nRight? I was a Lolth-Sworn Drow druid. Where's my spider-tiddies, Larian?\n\nBro stop I'm already buying it, you don't have to keep trying to sell it\n\nI guess that answers the question of whom women would rather be alone in a forest with.\n\nwell the bears also a muscle dilf, so the jury's definitely still out on that one\n\nAnd psychic squid\n\nGotta get that Illithussy.\n\n\"DO YOU NEED ASSISTANCE!?\"\n\nIt's still largely discretion shots, but shows a lot more than Dragon Age Origins.\n\nI'll always laugh at Morrigan's sex scene in Origins. Her ordinary clothes were skimpier than her underwear.\n\nSomething in Fallout 3/4/NV. The raider enemies would be wearing see through wire mesh strainers as armor, until you looted their armor.\n\nSuddenly they'd be wearing a tshirt and boxers.\n\nI wouldn't call Minthara's scene discretion shots.\n\nYou can make all your characters walk around completely naked. Dicks and bush and all hanging out lol plus it’s a damn fun game. \n\nEven if you have grown bored of most games or are depressed, THIS is the game to try again on.\n\nI didn't make the whole way through but about 75% and that's 70% more than all the other games this decade.\n\nIts probably the horniest not a porn game there is.\n\nMore than Witcher 1/2/3?\n\nWitcher 1 would literally be like \n\nFarmer Girl: Hello handsome \n\nGerald: handsome you say...hehe, don't hear that much. \n\n*Fade to black*\n\nPORN CARD ACQUIRED\n\nWitcher 1 literally starts with explaining that you're immune to disease but *unfortunately* cannot bear children.\n\nI've encountered literal porn games with less conspicuous setup than that.\n\nThe difference between hot coffee and bg3 is that the hot coffee was unused and unrated code inside the game. When modders found it in the pc version the esrb board re-evaluated the game and increased its rating. Adding on top of that bad faith news reporting as if the content was accessible by anyone including children(which honestly shouldn't have been playing it in the first place based on the esrb rating) leading to many outraged parents who didn't properly understand the situation.  \n\nWhile BG3 was well just out there with its content... Including bears. Anyone checking the game would reasonably know the content was there.\n\nTo quote someone who summed it up nicely: \"moral panic over the fact there's consensual intercourse in the wholesome policeman murdering simulator\"\n\nthis reminds me of that tweet elon musk made where he talked about how awful it is you can kill cops in GTA but yet he still plays it apparently.\n\nIt was also only accessible on the console versions of the game with a hex editor. You couldn't access it from the game itself.\n\nThis.  \nIt’s that those parts of GTA were not screened for rating. So it gets the strictest rating.  \nIn BG3, playing the game would show this.\n\nTo be fair to gta, it wasn't supposed to be rated, it was not even supposed to be seen, they messed up to be sure but it was an honest mistake\n\nI'm not sure about BG3, but one of the bigger aspects of why hot coffee would lead to an AO rating is interactivity. Watching a sex scene is going to get a less harsh rating than actually controlling it.\n\nEating out that githussy\n\nLaezel down bad for istikussy\n\nDoes the carpet match the scales?\n\nDoing da Githyanki Panky.\n\nDo you actually see the genitals explicitly in BG3? (That was one of the announced features of Cyperpunk 2077, if I'm not mistaken)\n\nYes. You can even pick between pubic hair and circumcision options.\n\nLol my wife hadn't played RPGs since Dragon Age Inquisition, I convinced her to play BG3, and she was totally taken aback when she read a setting that said Vulva B in the character creation. \"Why is there a vulva B?? Wait there's a penis too?\"\n\nI made a joke to my friend on the xbox and included a picture of creating my bg3 character. I said \"Character creation is going well.\" Then included a picture of a half orc woman with a full beard and giant ant eater hanging out.\n\nXbox then gave me a 2 day live ban.\n\nYes, but the actual sex scenes are pretty tame. No erections, no penetration.\n\nYou can see them during the character creator and I think even when you take all your armor and clothes off.\n\nCan confirm, you can play through the game naked with genitals hanging out.\n\nJust make your \"camp clothes\" slot empty then switch the option to \"wear camp clothes instead of armor.\"\n\nI reloaded a save when &gt;!Shadowheart tried to kill Laezel in her sleep just to replay that scene but while they're both naked.!&lt;\n\n&gt; Just make your \"camp clothes\" slot empty then switch the option to \"wear camp clothes instead of armor.\"\n\n[relevant VLDL skit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNCN4iC1TyM)\n\nOnly if you choose the option to view it yourself. There's a barbie doll option that just makes the area smooth and no nipples. The scenes fade to black much earlier too I think.\n\nIt's literally one of the first 3 options the game gives you before character creation.\n\nThat's what Jack Thompson being disbarred / discredited will do for an industry.\n\nI saw the top screenshot and immediately went \"Oh yeah, right, I live in a world where Jack Thompson is disbarred\" and my mood was immediately a little better than it was before. Afaik he's also been declared a vexatious litigant which, in the wonderful words of Jason Scott, means that he's been such an annoying, useless and outright detriment to the legal system that \"he is in the eyes of the court, a fuck\" and is no longer allowed to represent himself without separate counsel.\n\nWe have Jerry and Mike at Penny Arcade to thank for that one.\n\nTheir usual passive aggressiveness really tilted him to the point where he couldn't help getting himself disbarred and he brought a RICO lawsuit against take two and penny arcade at one point.\n\nI think it gives Jack Thompson too much credit to imply that his presence held the industry back in this way.\n\nHe was quite the ghoul in his fifteen minutes of fame. He was the one to raise the flag about this, and that attracted the attention of other legislators who wouldn't have known or cared otherwise. \n\nHis efforts forced the ESRB to change the rating of GTA San Andreas to AO until they removed the content- which means that most retailers took the game off store shelves. \n\nHe also tried to do the same thing with Bully because you could kiss a boy.\n\nIt was like clockwork when a new GTA or other violent game would drop, that gargoyle would appear on tv spouting the same shit.\n\nTV lost power to manipulate everything about videogames now our generation are the parents who should be crazy about that, but we don't give a shit about tv anymore\n\n[deleted]\n\nFor a country that's world's first at production and distribution of porn, Americans sure hate seeing *penetrative* sex\n\n[deleted]\n\nWe'll never know whats behind those pixels, could be anything!\n\nLooking into it\n\n\"Sex\" it's two fully clothed models grinding on each other. It's no different than smacking barbie dolls together and making suggestive noises.  I'd like to say 2004 was a different time but honestly we're cycling back.\n\nThe interesting thing is, GTA:SA would probably still be AO under the current rules.\n\nThe ESRB's beef with it wasn't *that the game contained sexual content and nudity, generally speaking.* Hell, as-is, the game didn't actually have nudity in those bits (they didn't get around to making naked skins for CJ and the girls for it before they pulled the plug on the feature, you have to mod the PC version to have that). Their beef was that, on top of that, it was a literal interactive sex minigame.\n\nThe only game I've ever seen have an interactive sex minigame and *not* get AO is Saints Row 2, which went out of its way to be as non-explicit as possible about it (you see it from the outside of the vehicle like picking up prostitutes in those GTA games, the sex noises are deliberately unrealistic and goofy, and the minigame doesn't directly tie into graphic details of what you're doing). Meanwhile, games have been getting away with tits and sex scenes at M since the mid-90s, so long as there's not straight-up a sex minigame associated with them (lest we forget Phantasmagoria and Fear Effect).\n\nYet God of war opening scene was a sex mini game with two badies\n\nThat was similar to Saint's Row 2; the actual act was completely off-screen, the audio was cartoony and unrealistic, and the minigame itself was a rhythm game that wasn't directly framed as \"press X to make Kratos thrust his dick.\"\n\nIt will always be so funny to me how society views killing and wonton murder, drug dealing and destruction in video games as okay\n\nBUT SEX! noooo think of the children!!\n\nHonestly a good sign that people have switched from viewing games as \"for kids\" to being just another form of media\n\nEver played the Witcher 3?\n\nlol in first witcher you literally collect card of woman you just fucked\n\nThe Witcher 3s scenes are tame compared to BG3.\n\nBack in the old days were you had to pay movie ticket prices just for kissing based sex scenes. Everyone was so easy to morally outrage back then. We do have morale outrage now but it feels a lot more about politics and less about sex and violence.\n\nI mean GTA always had that mainstream touch of controversy : Oh, you can run people over, kill everyone, hire prostitutes... So imagine a sex mode that children can play ??? Meanwhile only the nerds care about Baldurs Gate and their tabletop rpg /s.\n\nAnd nowadays, there are such an exagerated quantity of porn games on Steam, and all these porn mods for Bethesda games, hot coffee is really soft in comparison now that I think about it.\n\nI would say complaining about this progression is counter productive. People have eased up on sex. It's a good thing. Everything takes time.\n\nProgress occurs one funeral at a time\n\n2005: God of War 1 had bare breasts visible.\n\nYou can't remove games from shelves if haves are not sold on shelves anymore\n\nIt helps that Baldur’s Gate is a little dense for children while GTA is baby’s first drive by.\n\nIs baldurs gate as good as everyone says it is?\n\nYou know it is funny\n\nI wonder if its... context? Or like others said really just the fact you controlling it\n\nHah, even at the time the whole hot coffee \"scandal\" in the news was so stupid if you actually knew anything about the game. \n\nI also remember when Mass Effect came out and the news tried to make it a controversy too when they heard about the love scene you could get after romancing one of the crew."

Would be a shame if they follow the same trajectory.\n\nEA will release SimCity 2 now and the vicious cycle will start all over again.\n\nTit for tat\n\n[deleted]\n\nTitties\n\nMorgan says they go well with sprinkles\n\nJust give me a vr sim ant remake\n\nI'd love a new release of SimCopter. I want to dangle buckets of water from copters to put out fires again.\n\nI seem to remember the ability to use a sim city 2000 save as the map file for that game.\n\nYou could! You could also do the same thing With Steets of Sim City and SC2k\n\nSim Tower! I want to be a cockroach infested slumlord again. \n\nI remember, as an 8-year-old playing video games for the first time, asking my mom how to make the little “-“ sign go away in front of my Available Funds box that otherwise had a HUGE number on it. \n\nThen I discovered on the internet that attempting to build a lobby in the bottom left corner of the map in the first 10 seconds gives you like ten million dollars. Ahh, the early days of cheats.\n\nFun fact, SimTower started out as a separate thing, simply called \"The Tower,\" that Maxis simply got the right to publish outside Japan, where they gave it the name \"SimTower.\" The developer, Yusuke \"Yoot\" Saito actually made a sequel called Yoot Tower that he released in 1998, as well as ports of the original game (without the \"Sim\" branding) for Gameboy Advance SP and Nintendo DS. He's also famous for working on the strange virtual pet game Seaman for Dreamcast.\n\n&gt;He's also famous for working on the strange virtual pet game Seaman for Dreamcast.\n\nMy god, I haven't heard the game in probably 20 years. I completely forgot about that game lol\n\nThere's a game called Project Highrise that plays similarly but it just isn't Sim Tower.\n\nwhy stop there, lets go Sim Life!\n\nSim Earth is the only game that matters. Oh, Spore, how I longed for you to fill that void in my gaming heart… and how you broke it.\n\nWhat kills me is spore delivered a functioning game. It had high hopes and was fun for what we got. \n\nAnimals that could poop on their own head that can colonize planets.\n\nI had a lot of fun with Spore. No regrets.\n\nIt wasn't bad at all. \n\nBut I won't lie i was a bit disappointed. I had to high of expectations and I also felt like I was playing 6 minigames instead of 1 complete game.\n\ni learned so much from that game manual. half of it was just educational material about ants\n\nThe vicious cycle of two companies creating similar products and the more popular product succeeding\n\nC:S isn't even that much better than SimCity. It has a good traffic simulator, I'll give it that, but socioeconomic side was a let-down. The only thing it had was revamped graphics compared to SimCity 4. A cycle driven by bad reputation will only produce marginal improvements.\n\nE: 4, not 2004\n\nWas it even really a good traffic simulator, though? I mean I know it's legitimately still one of the best *available*, and I've put hundreds of hours into the thing, but I feel like we all just got familiar with the tricks you need to keep the entire city from ending up piled into a single left turn ramp on a single one of your four available expressways. And also we're all running like 30 different road tweaking mods and forget they're not even part of the actual game.\n\nThat's what blows my mind most about the sequel, that the traffic doesn't seem to have changed at all. Rapidly approaching 20 years since the \"independent agent revolution\" in these city simulators, and they still can't make a single person listen to a traffic report before planning a route. like\n\nIt's even more egregious now that we've all got literal personalized computers planning traffic routes for us on the fly IRL, and these sim citizens are still barely willing to change a lane in the entire preloaded point-to-point.\n\nThat sounds like the most accurate traffic simulator to me\n\nYep. Actual city planners run all the numbers, use historical data, use comparatives from other cities with similar interchanges and so on and so on and *then* once they build out whatever seems best, watch how us morons actually use the infrastructure and try to mitigate our idiocy later.\n\nThat's not true at all. Just look at the recently opened Rozelle interchange in Sydney.\n\nThey ignored the numbers, they ignored advice from planners, and they told everyone to deal woth it after they opened the interchange and fucked all local traffic just to funnel people into a toll road.\n\nWell, fair enough. Financial incentives can corrupt the process thoroughly in many cases I expect.\n\nA city of 10000 IRL doesn't generate nearly as much traffic as a city of 10000 in C:S\n\nIt's largely because cities skylines doesn't understand intersections in the base game. If you put in TM:PE and Road Extensions so you can do shit like protected turn signals, yield and stop management, and turning lanes vs travel lanes, the traffic **will** clear up.\n\nI don't see how you think that the traffic didn't change at all when in 2 they completely ignore signage and drive where they shouldn't. It seems to be very basic, they even drive on pedestrian only roads.\n\nOne of the big flaws in the traffic system is the lack of a meaningful day/night cycle, compounded or related to the fact that cims don't seem to factor in distance when choosing jobs/homes/amenities. If the cim moves into a suburb in the east, and gets randomly paired with a job downtown in the west, the cim will be perfectly happy spending 4 hours commuting one-way. Iirc, Sim City 4 will display a \"no job\" warning if a residence isn't within commuting distance to an appropriate job, eventually causing the sim to move out.\n\nthat moddability made it. Then they released 2 without any of that easy access to mods. \n\nSomeone/many people in their office - you can bet your house on it - likely pointed out the massive fail that this would result in, regardless of how good the base game goes out like - ignoring ofc  the fact that the base game was never going to be a worldbeater because of all the press releases being put out *before* the game even released to say how it wasn't even finished...\n\nC:S wasn't designed as a competitor for SimCity 4. It was designed as a competitor for SimCity 2013.\n\nExactly. We're not going to get a better product if the bar is set by the other company's disastrous failure.\n\nSC4 is the better city builder. Cities Skylines is so traffic focused and the city management layer is so easy that it never actually beat SC4 at what SC4 was.\n\nAs I've said before: Cities Skylines is an excellent diorama, painter, or traffic simulator.\n\nSimCity is an excellent city, budget, and balancing simulator (their spreadsheets/details on how everything works is astounding).\n\nThey are fundamentally different, but look the same on the surface.\n\n&gt; It has a good traffic simulator\n\nI mean, it doesn't though *really* - cars are constantly vanishing into thin air and there's no need for worrying about where all of those countless cars actually need to *park* because people just put the car away in their pocket when they pull over - it just has the *illusion* of being a good traffic simulator. Which is really what most people actually want, because an actual traffic simulator would drive most people mad, mainly because it would force them to realise that stubborn over-reliance on cars as the primary solution to getting around a city is completely unreasonable.\n\nIt's pretty ridiculous that you couldn't build a pedestrian shopping district in the most popular city building game without mods until one of its final DLCs.\n\nI think they did it worse. \n\n-\treleased a crappy broken game. \n-\tpromise to fix it\n-\tdon’t fix it and release a crappy broken paid dlc\n-\tpromise fix it \n-\ttry to remove the dlc and break the main game. \n\nI think ea just released a crappy broken game then abandoned it.\n\n[deleted]\n\nThe paradox workshop only exists to chase console sales, not to help modders in any real way.\n\nSo even the mod tools are scummy.\n\nI dont understand how a company can release a game THIS legendarily bad and expect console gamers to pay 60-70 dollars for a 2-3 year old game.\n\nCities Skylines isnt GTA V, they dont have the quality or reputation to delay a release by years.\n\n&gt; I dont understand how a company can release a game THIS legendarily bad and expect console gamers to pay 60-70 dollars for a 2-3 year old game.\n\nBecause it does often work like that regardless of reputation. But they forget that it's not a predictable or repeatable formula for success. It's just gambling.\n\nEngineering hours that should have gone into the game itself. \n\nIt’s a textbook, “Either die a hero…” situation, yeah. \n\nThat's something that hadn't crossed my mind. Skylines rose out of the shadow of a spiritual predecessor going \"watch me do this wicked flip\" and completely stacking it. They were great, original was a fantastic game. Now they've done their own act of hubris, and it's hard to see them recovering.\n\nWonder if we'll get history repeating and see something new rising up.\n\nUnfortunately the only real alternative to Cities Skylines 2 is modded Cities Skylines 1.\n\nMe and my friends actually had some fun with SC 2013. Not much, but some.\n\nIt was a fun game, but it ran out of things to do too quickly.\n\nPeople love bitching about SC 2013 but it's gameplay systems are fantastic. If they just released it but let you build much bigger maps and removed the always online people would be raving about it. Literally \"tiny map size\" and the always online part are the only two things people ever bring up when complaining about it.\n\nThe max map size being less than 1/6 the size of prior games is a pretty big issue for a city builder. \n\nI remember playing the demo/test/preview or whatever and I literally ran out of space in under two hours of gameplay. To this day I can not fathom what were they smoking.\n\nThose two items though are pretty major criticisms. It's SimCity not Sim-TinyLittleVillage.\n\nAlso city inhabitants didnt act like real persons (as they promised). Every inhabitant left its house and went to the nearest work place avaible, when work was over, it went to the first empty house to live there and repeat, which is why snail house form cities worked perfectly.\n\nAlso city inhabitant count was a lie. they just didnt have the capacity for so many calculations, therefore they just bloated your city inhabitant number, but never really added a person to represent that.\n\nAnd dont even get me started on traffic. They never checked road capacity. You bild a direct dirt road, and a slightly curved highway between point A and B. Bam - every god damn single car used the direct dirt road, completely blocking it and not a single car uses the highway right next to it, because distance calculation shows its 1% longer than dirt road.\n\nEtc. etc.\n\nTL,DR: I hated SC2013 for a few more reasons.\n\nCautionary Tale of Two Cities\n\nskylines still is one of my chill games ill boot up and run to decompress, watching skylines 2 has been cringey and painful\n\nWas just talking to a friend about playing Skylines’ multiplayer mod as a chill “co-op” game since he didn’t know that was a thing, and then we both talked about how disappointed we were in 2’s release.\n\nThe skylines co-op mod was unplayable at best when I tried it some years back, how is it now?\n\nRoommate and I have played \\~15-20 hours and a 75k pop city so far with minimal issue. A few restarts due to desync, but overall extremely playable.\n\nRimworld coop mod, Skylines coop mod, Elden Ring coop mod, Armored Core VI coop mod, Subnautica coop mod, Skyrim coop mod.. it is almost as if there is demand for good coop games. :D\n\nFor real. And Helldivers proves this too.\n\nOr BG3 which won every single game of the year award\n\nI genuinely forget that BG3 is coop. But thats probs cause i have no friends\n\nIt even has splitscreen like all larians rpgs. \nHalo masterchief edition even took out splitscreen :(.\nI miss couch co-op...\n\nWhen you kill a bug in Helldivers it reincarnates in CS2.\n\nFor managed democracy\n\nFor freedom!\n\nTrue, but Helldivers isn't coop on the same scale as these games are in single player. These mods demonstrate that there is a demand for co-op RPG rather than just MMORPGs like Fallout 76 and The Elder Scrolls Online.\nI guess the main difficulty with co-op RPG games is that is to credit the host and guest characters with progression and xp that they may or may not use in their saved game.\n\nIn terms of Rimworld specifically, there aren't a lot of management games that have multiplayer support. The only heavily played one is openTTD. Previously there was Simcity 5, and there are more obscure options like Simcity 2000 Network Edition.\n\nThe Capitalism series was great. Or The Guild. Pizza Tycoon. Cities in Motion 2 was also a nice coop management game. There is of course Factorio and Satisfactory. And a load of German simulator games.\n\nNice, i've always wondered what life would be like if i were german\n\nI still don't know why From doesn't just do the tiniest bit of work to make the Elden Ring Co-op mod into an official feature. It'd be such a huge slam dunk for them, especially alongside the new DLC coming soon. Even my most casual friends who've never modded a game in their lives were ravenous to try out that mod and asked me to help them get it up and running. I mean the modder made it mostly functional in under a week or something. It can't be that difficult for a full team of devs to implement a more polished, official version.\n\nIts same way we never got skyrim coop, instead they jumped to making mmos / pvp games with their franchise. People \\*want\\* to fuck around with buddies in their rpgs (see, Baldurs Gate III)\n\nThat's the one complaint I had about Elden Ring, the dogshit coop\n\nIf anything this just makes me miss a good split screen co-op even more\n\nWhere did they go?\n\nthat's why I ended up so disappointed with fallout 76, all I've ever wanted was co-op but they MMO'd it instead. so many times back in school I'd show fallout 3/NV to a friend but the excitement would wear off when we realized we can't play together. fallout 4 would've been the perfect coop loot and shoot for me, and building shit together would be fun\n\nI think the issue with 76 is instead of adding multiplayer to fallout 4 they decided they could milk way more $ from people reusing the assets to make a multiplayer game. So as you said instead of being a genuinely good multiplayer game 76 is closer to an MMO cash grab that has good stuff in it but is intentionally grindy with plenty of issues.\n\nIt's wild how they stole the market out from under Sim City when EA fucked it up, and now they are doing the same thing.\n\n&gt;and now they are doing the same thing.\n\non a speed run\n\nYeah I was looking forward to 2 releasing on Xbox but I'm very much glad it didn't. Seems like the entire life of the game since release has been a shit show. \n\nMakes me a lot less interested in it once it does finally release on consoles. Clearly very little respect for the player base and very little care toward their own product. Very tired of these companies releasing broken games and expecting everyone to just suck it up.\n\nPassionate studio makes a great game, business/marketing/finance move in and ‘improve’ the company and product.. this has become the life cycle of game devs.\n\nNot only game devs - Boeing did it too.\n\nBoeing was a bit different... in that they literally acquired a drowning competitor and then allowed that competitor's C-Level employees to stay on and start influencing policy... to make Boeing more like their own company that drowned due to those same decisions...\n\nAbsolutely boggles the fucking mind.\n\nI almost want to go back to school to get whatever degree these fucking \"consultants\" use to get hired just so I can go into a studio and tell every jackoff with a marketing degree to get the fuck out of the production meetings.\n\nHonestly that's probably going to be the only way things Change. Higher ups in these companies dont understand how the business they're in charge of works - they just liaten to the people that are brought in for them and nod their heads. They hear \"money bar will go up fastest if-\" and approve it. Only way to combat that is to get people in the business actually pushing back in the meetings.\n\nYep. Bought a computer after playing skylines on a ps4, specifically for skylines 2. That was in November. I still don't have skylines 2 and, instead, have repurchased skylines 1 for PC.\n\nIts been hard. I was excited to check it out until I saw the issues, only to now watch it get worse. What the hell happened? Why is this game like this?\n\nI try that, but then my perfectionism kicks in and I find it stressful.\n\nThe game just becomes traffic simulator to me too quickly, and I never can get it right no matter how much effort. I've looked plenty of guides, even downloaded pre-made road assets. I always fail to get the traffic to work smoothly.\n\nIt's not really your fault most likely. The AI for traffic on both games is horrendous, cars will stick in a single backed up line stretching for miles in a 4 lane highway.\n\nYou can play it better or worse, but plenty of solutions that work well irl like roundabouts fail miserably in the game, so you aren't learning traffic management, you are learning city skylines traffic AI\n\nchill until out of the blue half the population dies or nearly every building gets a not enough buyers for seemingly mo reason.\n\nor you brick your city by starting a feedback loop of sick and dying from losing power to sewage facilities!\n\nAs a longtime fan/player of CS1:\n\n\nThey're reaping what *they* sowed.\n\n\nIt seems mighty clear that, like so many titles, this was rushed and released in a far *far* too incomplete &amp; dysfunctional state.\n\nIt’s genuinely so confusing to me why they didn’t release in early access considering how far behind they were. If they had framed this as something like: “hey development has fallen behind, the game isn’t optimized to the level we want yet, the mod editor isn’t finished, and the simulation isn’t quite balanced right. But we still want everyone who’s been waiting patiently for Cities: Skylines 2 to be able to enjoy the game when we promised, so we are launching in early access. It still has a fair amount of issues and is very resource-intense, but we’ll be releasing improvements and fixes regularly and keeping you updated every step of the way on our progress. We understand this is disappointing for our fans, but we look forward to releasing the full game in Q3 2024 when we feel it’s up to Colossal Order standards. We thank you for your understanding and your support over the years.”\n\nThey probably sell, what, 70% of the copies they ended up selling anyways on launch? Cities Skylines players are (or at least were) a pretty damn dedicated &amp; enthusiastic fanbase. I’d have almost definitely bought it. But the benefit is if you do that, everyone’s expectations are properly aligned and they know that the game they’re buying isn’t done yet.\n\nBecause that’s truly the most mind-blowing thing about this. Cities Skylines wasn’t one of those games that releases like a little too early and it’s kinda buggy on launch but they clean it up quickly. You can totally get away with that and many popular games have.\n\nIn the case of CS:2, the game just wasn’t done. I don’t think anyone at CO or Paradox would tell you the game was done with a straight face. And hell, it’s *still* not done and at best passes for “playable.” For the first 2 months the game barely worked at all and about 50% of the features were completely broken as it lit your 4080 Super on fire trying to maintain 60 FPS. There’s clearly a good game buried in there — CS: 2 has really solid bones to build off of — but it launched probably at least a year too early. \n\nYou *just have to* tell people if you’re selling them something in that unfinished of a state, and I don’t understand how publishers continue to fuck that up. If you’re honest and launch in beta, a bunch of people will still buy the game, you get to re-hype it for the “full version” release that you can package with DLC, and you avoid the PR shitstorm in the middle for basically scamming people.\n\nMy bet is Paradox wouldn't like that because selling DLC in early access would start a riot, and Paradox decided that enough money was spent on development, and it was time to transition to DLC.\n\nThat said, early access would have been the best choice.... and I wouldn't be against stuff packs during early access as asset creators working on them wouldn't take much resources away from working on the main game.\n\nI'd be willing to bet the first DLC was so bad because 1. Paradox demanded DLCs be released on a specific timeline, and 2. Most devs are still working on finishing the main game, which made putting actual resources into the DLC impossible. \n\nAlso, how do you even make a good DLC that changes how the game is played when the game itself isn't finished?\n\nWhat a disaster, likely created by the bean counters shooting themselves in the foot.\n\nSo Paradox, in an attempt at chasing their revenue numbers from DLC, proceeded to completely shotgun their game and kill it. I'd say that they might as well not release it, but I guess a sale is a sale, even if it's less than expected.\n\nI don't think Paradox is solely to blame.  Usually I would side with the developer in a case where the publisher is a separate entity, but it seems Colossal Order has their own share of culpability in the release state of this game.  They were clearly overambitious, and the CEO of said developer told customers straight-up the problem is with them for not liking the simulation, not that the simulation wasn't up to snuff.\n\nCO is also a relatively small studio for creating a game of this scale, and it is evident in the release and post-release support.  More personal opinion here, but I don't think they're the most sophisticated of development teams, either.  Some of it was self-inflicted with using beta aspects of Unity and then running into further problems.\n\nConsumers still haven't learned their lesson, however.  I saw lots of apologists pre-release saying everything would be fine by the deadline, and then those same people complaining after pre-ordering about how the game isn't in a proper release-ready state.\n\nIt's like the Redfall problem. The devs struggled to nail down what they wanted their game to be and figured it out far too late, still with some unresolved issue. Microsoft said they had to release by a specific date as per their release schedule. They released a probably not even half done game. It was a bunch of randomly scattered assets over the map with broken AI with a few tiny bits completed here and there. No polish was done.\n\nIn that case both the devs and publisher were at fault. The devs for struggling or flip flopping on the design of the game and the publisher for forcing it out when it wasn't ready.\n\nUntil consumers learn to avoid these games and to not buy on release or pre-order, they will continue to screw themselves by buying unfinished broken products that may be abandoned.\n\n&gt; Microsoft said they had to release by a specific date as per their release schedule.\n\n\"Crunch\" is a sign of administration failure, not a necessary part of the industry.\n\nConsumers never learn. It's actually sad because products keep getting worse because of this very reason. Apple doesn't have to release a better iPhone... People will buy them anyway.\n\nI believe there was also a period of time where they were worried about the legal implications of promising a dlc and then not releasing it, where people were promised it alongside the deluxe edition.\n\nSo something I read was that they released the DLC to save them from that, but then they had allocated so much time to fixing the game that they didn’t really have any content (they offered like 20 housing assets for 2 themes and a whopping FOUR trees) and was met with so much criticism that they backtracked on it and made it free\n\nAs a huge fan of the game who followed the whole release, it seems like they genuinely want to fix the game but are struggling to get on the same page as Paradox when it comes to release dates and planned DLC, leading to the shitshow we have now. \n\nThe bones of the game are definitely there but it’s just hard to match the fully realized content and mods of the first game. I think they will eventually but these mistakes are not helping the public goodwill\n\nMan paradox is such a genuine cancer and it sucks they have their hands on a relatively niche genre so changes will never come. They ruined prison with this shit as well\n\n[deleted]\n\nLiterally all anyone in a suit read in this comment is \"70% of what we would have sold\"\n\nShort term profits &gt; literally anything\n\n&gt; I don’t understand how publishers continue to fuck that up.\n\n\nHubris coupled with unbridled avarice.\n\n\n(Them): *\"Suuuure, those mistakes may have happened to No Man's Sky, and Cyberpunk, and a whole slew of other titles, but... not* **us**. *We're clearly better than that - right? Guys... right!?\"*\n\nBruh, you just named success stories. The fact that gamers forgave NMS and CP2077 is why more games like this keep releasing. They see those games as good examples for how they can get away with releasing a buggy broken mess.\n\nI pre-ordered the deluxe edition. Once it was obvious that modding was not coming at day 1 and the game looked just *bad*, I cancelled that.\n\nOptimization, lack of assets, and modding. Those 3 things are core, and modding resolves the assets part - let players create the assets for you and that reduces dev time. Code modding could probably even resolve some of the optimization issues (key word, *some*).\n\nCS1 released with modding day 1. CS2 was originally promised modding at day 1. Then it turned into \"days after release\" then \"weeks.\" We're now 6 months post-release and modding still isn't a thing. Instead, they release a DLC pack that added 2 palm trees and a couple of houses which are 90% parking lots.\n\nReally, all they need to do is devote everything to modding at this point. Once that's released, players can work in parallel on new assets. Should players need to do that? No, but creators undoubtedly will do it because they enjoy it.\n\nI don't even think there was a huge clamor for CS2 yet either, people are *still* playing 1 because it's such a huge game. I think they rushed it out the door because they were trying to launch around the same time some other big city builder game was coming out that I think also shit the bed (can't remember the name) but because of that we got a game that's half finished and doesn't include enough to really distinguish itself from a heavily modded CS1\n\nKSP 2 is on the exact same situation, i hate two see both of my all time favourite games go on this path.\n\nTis the way of game publishing now for the vast majority of titles. *\"It'll be reeeally great!! I mean,* **someday**, *eventually! Trust us, bro!\"*\n\n\nI'm hearing folks talking up FO4 [edit: I meant FO/76!] being *now* really fun -- *six years after release* and all the myriad development fumbles, nightmares, and overhauls.\n\n\nMeanwhile... Larian just laughing allllll the way to multiple GOTY awards.\n\n[deleted]\n\nLet's just agree they're right. Please don't make me think about low long ago FO4 _actually_ came out\n\n[deleted]\n\nIt'll keep happening as long as people buy games out of brand loyalty. If people wait for reviews and make an informed decision where to spend, then developers won't get away with this shit.\n\nfirst time playing a Paradox title? they don't release finished products. it's a fault of the consumer at this point honestly. we know what we're getting.\n\nThat's just the new Brutalist dlc.\n\nHoly shit now I really want a brutalist DLC. Raw, grey and so massive it blocks out the sun!\n\nGiedi Prime edition.\n\nYou may want to look into Workers &amp; Resources: Soviet Republic. It's more complicated than Skylines, as you need to manage the actual movement of, well, workers and resources. But it captures the feel of eastern bloc architecture really well.\n\n1 new asset for the low low price of 18 euros!\n\nI was pretty hyped for the initial release but man, after hearing issue after issue with the game I'm glad I didn't spring for it\n\nI played for a bit thinking it wasn’t that bad then I got to the part where I had to modify landscapes… why the f was it so hard lol\n\nSome of these modern games suck at the most basic fucking thing its galling.\n\nMaking paths in Planet Zoo is ridiculously difficult. You can do basic straight lines, but anything fancier is a shitfest.\n\nIt’s funny because making sidewalks and roads is the one thing CS2 does really well. But then the terraforming tool is so lacking that you literally can not recreate things mountains, hills, or rivers the same way the devs did when making the maps.\n\nPatient gamers for life. I'm tired of hearing so many people say that they trust the company and love every release, even if it was a little problematic at first.\n\nIt only takes being burnt once. Why take the chance?\n\nbut at least the negative reviews are gone! 🙄/s\n\nTime to negative review the base game and get it deleted\n\n“This just in: Developer deletes base game to hide negative reviews”\n\nThat'll teach them not to leave negative reviews!\n\n\"Following Youtube, Steam says it's now time to do away with negative reviews and voting options.\"\n\nI'm waiting for any number of gaming websites to pick up your post on reddit and write an article about it LMAO.\n\nI wonder how many people from management are axed for their total failure of project management ... my bet is on 0\n\nMeanwhile every key developer was probably fired for \"not meeting expectations\" or given annual raises lower than the rate of inflation until they had to quit to afford rent.\n\nBut the share price went up!\n\n&gt;But the share price went up!\n\nThe only thing that's been a bigger failure then skylines 2 is their share price.\n\nAnd there is an CEO screaming at his Devs who told him the game wasn't ready to release in the first place\n\nHer, in this case. The CEO is Mariina Hallikainen. CEOs can be bad regardless of identity.\n\nIt's a real impressive fall from grace.\n\n[removed]\n\nKerbal was bought by a different studio. Original team has nothing to do with the sequel.\n\nThe original team actually (or part of them at least) just released a game about building RC vehicles and its great. Still has some stuff to work out but it's brand new and pretty ambitious as you might expect. Kithack model club on steam. Definitely worth keeping an eye on imo.\n\nWhat happened to KSP?\n\n[removed]\n\nI didn't even know KSP2 existed. Shows how well that went.\n\nLast I checked it's not even half baked.\n\nThey wanted to add interstellar travel, but doing that makes the map so large that you can't do that in a single coordinate space. 16 digits to define location aren't enough when you want to go 7,000,000,000,000,000 meters away.\n\nSo they gave every massive body in the solar system it's own coordinate space.\n\nSo at some point you cross between one coordinate space and another and the game has to transpose your location, velocity, etc. from one to the other. There are many other space games that I know for a fact do this and handle it well. KSP2 does not.\n\nIt frequently screws up when handling the transition from one coordinate space to another. It blows up the ship, doesn't translate the velocity so the ship is just stopped dead in space, or one of a dozen other issues.\n\nIt also can't predict a ships path through another coordinate plane. Want to do a gravity assist to go fast &amp; far with less fuel? too bad.\n\nThey've also made all the connections MUCH more wobbly and prone to just snapping / collapsing in flight.\n\nSo in the 'Build rockets &amp; do orbital mechanics!' game, you can no longer build big rockets, or do orbital mechanics.\n\nIt happens when they try to make money making machines instead of fun games.\n\nManor Lords a single person dev (for the most part) is looking great, he's spent like 7 years making it. \n\nI really hope a big publisher doesn't get hold of it or a sequal, they just squeeze the life out of it.\n\nIIRC, the original Mount and Blade was mostly the work of two people. Fantastic game that I spent tons of hours playing, back in the day. It had some quirks, but was still totally fun. The expansion and later the sequel have been fun as well.\n\nSome companies set out to make money by selling a good game. Other companies just set out to make money. It's not surprising which of the two ends up with better games.\n\n\"Paradox ruins management game\" smh 2024 truly is hell\n\nThis was supposed to be Paradox cash-cow. I remember their excitement on the announcement stream.\n\nI guess they all got too greedy… how about giving developers the time they need instead of caving in to shareholder pressure and short term cash grabs... \n\nAs a fan of the IP, I’m as hurt and frustrated as everyone else :(\n\ncompany that shouldn't have gone public went public and does public company things.\n\nIt's a tale as old as time and no one ever learns from it and repeats the cycle.\n\n[deleted]\n\nParadox has always released things half-broken - e.g. Victoria 2 isn't really playable without the DLC. Their most polished releases have been Stellaris and CK3, both after they went public...\n\n\nMain difference recently IMO is that their games tended to improve greatly patch after patch, but they now seem to be struggling to do this. I haven't been excited for a Stellaris, CK3 or HOI4 update in ages, and Victoria 3 (which also released in a 'not quite ready' state, although overall acceptable) is struggling to really get going as well - the first few patches were not *bad*, but aggressively *meh*.\n\n\nIt is like they don't really know their customers anymore. Compared to the recent Factorio dev diaries which have announced so many features that hit the scratch (space logistics! Quality modules! Moar trains!), recent (post-pandemic) PDX dev diaries mostly feel like they're either bandaids or side-fluff...\n\nThe \"They will release DLCs and support the games for a long time so a broken game at launch is fine\" talking point from the fans made them complacent. They got away with releasing broken game after broken game until they didn't.\n\nNow they are releasing DLCs but those don't fix the game anymore. Also after the tenth broken game at release people will just stop buying it: \"If they fix it after 3 DLCs I buy it after 3 DLCs\".\n\nDepends from the perspective, the people who sold the company are rich now.\n\nRich, likely retired and no longer care.\n\nYeah, but look at the huge influx of FREE CASH that HAS NO STRINGS ATTACHED WHAT SO EVER.\n\nThe start of all enshittification\n\nI don't think paradox is capable of anything but turning games into DLC mills nowadays.\n\nThat wouldn't be the worst thing, if the game were superb and the prices are fair. \n\nI do really wish they would sell World of Darkness to another studio though so we can finally get a sequel or reboot to Bloodlines\n\nWhy is it called the worst dlc ever? Context?\n\nSomeone might have a more complete answer but I know they had a $10 DLC called “Beach Properties” that was just a few repeating assets, none of which were actual beach houses.\n\nAlso they released the DLC before fixing the base game and charging another 10 bucks.\n\nAnd it didn’t add any type of sand texture in to make an actual beach\n\nThis has been my favorite fun fact so far.\n\nIt was because they have to fulfil the dlc promises for people who brought the game with the dlc pass. \n\nBut they had said before they weren't going to release DLC before they could fix the game. They then released this crap, changed their minds and gave it for free. Now back to focus on fixing the game before DLC again. Massive clusterfuck. Seriously need a management change.\n\n...and 4 palm trees.  4\n\nI went and read the [Steam reviews](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2427740/Cities_Skylines_II__Beach_Properties/) as I don't follow that franchise much and this seems to sum it up:\n\n&gt; Beach Properties is just a further extension of the fraud that the Ultimate Edition of Cities Skylines: 2 is trying to push out as \"content\". This asset pack is a fraud, everything looks damn near the same, its as low effort copy paste as possible. Trees you have to pay for in this pack should be in the base game. Also \"beach properties\" doesn't actually mean \"beach assets\". When placing these zones when you zoom out it almost looks as if you've just placed the same building repeatedly offering little or no variety for these areas. No quays, beach front leisure areas or parks, no piers, no midways, nothing that would actually be a property in a beach community other than basic *** houses and commercial zones that look pathetically similar to each other. This is one of the worst turds they've ever released as additional content for any Cities Skyline game.\n\nEdit: I just saw this, lol: \"Notice: At the request of the publisher, Cities: Skylines II - Beach Properties is unlisted on the Steam store and will not appear in search.\"\n\nIt was the lowest rated product on Steam for All Time in terms of overall reviews. It was like 4% positive, which was the lowest product ever released on the platform.\n\nI think Leviathan dlc for eu4 had like 5% rating too. Paradox just wanted to beat their record!\n\nIt really has been a shit show to watch this game fumble so much. I know the original had its troubles but its a far cry from what this is.\n\n\nI couldnt buy 2 at release because money was short, kind glad i held off now in retrospect. I hope in 12 months the games in a much more solid and stable place. \n\n\nIf the devs read this, please tell your bosses (because im certain you guys dont like this anymore than we do) to just pack this shit in and go back to the originals content model\n\nThey've had nearly a year to fix the base game, and instead they put out shit DLC. This company doesn't care about the game or about quality.\n\nAll they had to do was to merge it into the base game and call it a gift to ask forgiveness of the poor state of the game.\n\nBut no, they had to fucked it up xD\n\nI mean that's what they're doing. They just removed the DLC ahead of the patch that adds it all back in free.\n\nIncredible how much-beloved games Kerbal Spaceprogram and Cities Skylines had so much community love and excitement for the real, next-gen step in truly polishing the game like Watch Dogs 2, Portal 2, Team Fortress 2, Helldivers 2, etc. \n\nInstead both KSP2 and CS2 were laggy, featureless failures that for some reason are still receiving \"development\" even when 95% of the playerbase for both games haven't made the swap\n\nLook at those \"next gen\" graphics for our \"next gen\" PCs.\n\nA classic case of MBA C-suite business idiots that think they're geniuses for running skeleton crews, and releasing an unfinished game early to pad quarterly reports. Good job drilling a once-great series into the ground.\n\nI love the irony of them literally just coming out and apologizing to the fanbase for dropping the ball. Then they turn around and do this lol\n\nCan someone give me some context on what happened to cause this DLC to be DELETED?\n\n[Cities Skylines 2 Dev Refunds DLC, Admits It Rushed It Out, and Apologizes to Disgruntled Players - IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/cities-skylines-2-dev-refunds-dlc-admits-it-rushed-it-out-and-apologizes-to-disgruntled-players)\n\nMy partner and I were excited for Cities Skylines 2 and Payday 3 respectively,  at the same time. I can't believe that Payday 3 turned out to be the (arguably) better game. At least its playable.\n\n[deleted]\n\nParadox are a scourge to game developers now. They release unfinished buggy games missing features and content so they can bloat their games with overpriced DLC and force a monthly subscription PER GAME. \n\nThey have fallen HARD in the past few years, and developer under the Paradox umbrella needs to get away ASAP, they are not your friends.\n\nGame was clearly rushed and seemed like it was produced as quick as possible for as cheap as possible. Reviews were dreadful and people agree the game not only sucks but barely functions.\n\nGame still sold over 1 million units and has turned a good profit and still sells 1000s of units weekly. On top of that even their dlc sold ok for what it is. They spent about 5 minutes putting some music together and threw it out there as dlc to see if anyone would buy it and several thousand people did (then all complained it was a waste of money).\n\nLike is it any wonder companies do this when people still fucking buy it. Why spend a lot of time and money making something good when you can rush out shit and people still buy it.\n\nThat’s the main problem with sports simulation games too like Madden, 2K, and Fifa. People complain every year about how awful they are but there’s also hordes of people who will keep buying them every year no matter what.\n\nThis team.... man they really lost it. All they had to do was remake cities 1 with better graphics and a few improvements and people would have been happy. The shall reap what they have sown.\n\nthis is becoming the standard for Paradox, stop rushing releases.\n\nMeanwhile the mods of /r/CitiesSkylines will still pretend everything is fine and any criticism of the clearly incompetent developers is a sacrilege.\n\nI can't believe how this situation keeps getting worse. CS1 was such a an amazing game and to see 2 being bungled so badly is just sad to see at this point. It's like they forgot how to release a good game. It's crazy that its the same studio. If I didn't know any better, I'd say they sold the IP to some 3rd party and just put their name on it. Just sad at this point"

But put me in front of a keyboard and I can type it in.\n\nThe human brain is weird isn't it\n\n[deleted]\n\nI can't even explain to someone how to tie their shoes despite tying my shoes for over thirty years.\n\nBlow their minds and show them the \"adult\" way to do it. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cBtqhq5P28\n\n  \n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cBtqhq5P28\n\ndeep cut\n\nhence the term \"muscle memory\"\n\nmy first experience with was actually during karate. when the black belts would explain a kata (sequence of moves) to the students, they would freeze up, frown, and then have to physically do the first few moves before they remembered the rest of it... for katas they've done literally thousands of times across several decades.\n\nThis is actually a bit funny and a bit sad. Many kata aren't just \"a sequence of moves,\" but a simulated, sometimes \"poetified,\" fight. The sequence aren't just meant to be burned into muscle memory, but analyzed/explained to show why those moves would be useful (or occasionally to pick up on some more artistic additions, like a bo kata, the name of which I can't remember, that includes a move meant represent kicking up sand into your opponents face with the bo).\n\nIt's certainly complex and counter-intuitive to us, but we don't fully understand what's going on in there, anyways. \"Weird\" seems like a word that you'd use when comparing two different ways of doing the same thing.\n\nNot counterintuitive, it's actually intuitive instead. It's saved to muscle memory instead of active memory. Allowing more information to be stored instead of actively remembering everything.\n\nIt's a real life macro, it's programmed into you to be an automatic response\n\nThat's a sick way of explaining\n\nSpoken like a programmer :)\n\n[deleted]\n\nNot steam password but long bank id and password. Cant remember what it is, but typing it no problem. I can sort of remember it when I imagine a keyboard and write down each character while going through the motions in my head. Similiar to how I dont know really know the ABC - like I couldnt just pick a random letter and start going from there, but I can say it in one piece when I start from one of the first letters.\n\nSeriously tho, who thought it was a good idea to make a sobriety test say the alphabet backwards???\n\nWhy are those even a thing? Just make them blow into the thing.\n\nBecause if you fail the field test and pass the breathalyzer they can still book you for being \"under the influence\" of something else. \n\nJust refuse the field test. They're not legally required. The breathalyzer is. If you know you're going to pass the breathalyzer, just ask for it instead. \n\nIf you're actually under the influence of something else, you'll still pass. Not that I condone that, the roads are fucking dangerous enough. Just don't drive fucked up. But if you're completely sober and fail a field test, you can still get a DUI or sorts.\n\nOf course it's some bs like that...\n\nCops who want to make their arrest quotas lol\n\nSame in regards to the bank stuff. I had to go in to resolve an issue once and the lady at the desk had a PIN pad for me to enter my PIN for verification. I got the PIN wrong three times before I realized her pad had the 1 in the lower left instead of the upper left. Most all POS PIN pads have the 1 in the upper left. I know the pattern of my PIN but not the numbers unless I visualize me typing it in.\n\nThis is how I am with spelling. I don't know how to spell worth a damn, but my fingers remember the words just fine.\n\nExact same with some gameplay mechanics. There are some games where I have no idea how to describe what button to press for a specific action or how to find something unless I'm behind the controller and playing myself. Like gaming has been so ingrained as almost muscle memory that controlling a character or interface is so instinctive that I don't even remember how I do it.\n\nI assume you're partly making a joke but I wanna recommend that you consider using a password manager just in case.  \n\nWith those you only really ever need to remember 1 really good password and even then most of the manager apps themselves support bio-metrics.  So you can just use your thumbprint/face ID to access your passwords more often than not.  \n\nJust some food for thought.\n\nNo I did actually forget it but I changed it a few years ago to a password I have saved when I couldn’t log in after I got a new phone\n\nHonestly if you have the Steam App you don't even need to know the password anymore because the app can sign you in.\n\nUnless your phone doesn't work anymore\n\nOr you lose your phone.\n\nOr you lose your planet in intergalactic war\n\nPassword Managers are good for sure, but with steam guard mobile you really don't need your steam password anymore.\n\nFace ID might not help either after 8-9 years...\n\nSteam is fantastic like that but you shouldn't actually forget your password like that bro it's a massive security risk. Even if it's 99% safe you should never take that 1% lightly. In 2022 someone tried to steal my steam account worth thousands in game purchases and only reason I didn't lose it was due to 2FA and I had to immediately get a new password, shit like that can happen.\n\nyou shouldn't know any of your passwords except your password manager. \n\ncheck out /r/bitwarden\n\nMaybe on the launcher. Steam's webpage is the absolute worst about it. I can't count how many times I've checked \"Remember Me\" on like every single web browser on every device I use, and it signs me out pretty much the next day. Every. Single. Time.\n\nI feel like that is because of how your browser handles cookies instead of the problem with steam itself. \n\nHonestly the only times I've had to log in is because of full system upgrades or refreshes, or when I was on someone else's system. Since they offered the qr code on the Steam app I haven't had to use my credentials log in for some time now.\n\nMany of them don't even last until the next hour's login after you just ticked them.\n\nStrangely enough mine actually last for quite a few hours after but the occasional system reboot I'll have to log back in on EA and related, especially if they've had a major update or want to do an update. Guess I'm lucky on a lot of these situations.\n\nFor the past half a year at least, I've had to log into steam every single time I turn on my PC, I wish the remember password option actually worked for me.\n\nWow that's insane. I'm so glad I don't. Have you had that when putting to sleep and full off/on both?\n\nYe steam is very good about identifying devices. I think part of it might come from recognizing the hardware too.\n\nsure, the client. but logging into Steam on mobile web is awful. constantly asks for login.\n\nI honestly almost never touch mobile web Steam, I either use the client used with steam guard on my phone or wait until I'm at home.\n\nDoes it? I've logged in to steam mobile once in like 2020 and I haven't had to log in again on mobile.\n\nWe use an SSO tool called Okta at work, and I once asked an Okta employee why their “Keep Me Signed In” checkbox didn’t seem to do much. He said basically, “It’s not that it doesn’t do *much*, it’s that it doesn’t do *anything*. It’s literally not hooked up to any logic, it’s only there because people expect it to be there.”\n\nI have no idea if he knew that as a fact or was just saying it, but I thought it was interesting. \n\nfor me it doesnst work in the ea launcher and Ubisoft. I am logged into 2 Steam accounts on my pc and never have to type the password.\n\nSome dont do that because of EU regulations. They need a timeout on their session cookie. Non shit developers refresh that every time you open it. Ubisoft doesnt\n\nTo be clear, there is no 30 day hard limit, it requires that organizations implement appropriate security measures to protect user data who may be logged in past 30 days.\n\nIt is pretty loose depending on the type of data you have.  Financial data?  You best set the 30 day limit.\n\n**Cookies**. Accept or reject.\n\n*Rejects cookies*\n\n\"Why does this dumb site make me log in every time?!\"\n\n“Ugh why I do have to reject these stupid cookies every time?  I wish it would remember my choice!!”\n\nIts actually a recommended security feature to expire logins after a time. It helps cut down on both forgetting passwords and potential security threats from stolen hardware.\n\nBecause they don't explain how it works.\n\nMany devices these days label it as \"remember this device for 15 days\" or something like that. Launchers like this have a predetermined time limit like this and the login is \"forgotten\" for security reasons.\n\nIt's a good thing to do; but these companies have done a shit job of communicating it\n\nIf you have your browser set to delete cookies, you will be logged out when that happens (e.g. when you close the window).\n\nWhen you log in, the web site typically sets a cookie on your browser. You will remain logged in as long as your browser keeps that cookie, and the web site neither forgets nor ends your session.\n\nSometimes web sites also set arbitrary limits on the session lengths, or are just too bad at remembering valid sessions. Or they end a session when you start a new one. Some also break and terminate your session if you access the same session from different tabs, or other stupid things like that.\n\nBut in my experience, on a system set to remember cookies, more competent web sites reliably keep me logged in for months.\n\nEdit: missed that this is about a launcher, not a web site. Steam will terminate your session either if your IP changes, or if your IP changes enough (i.e. it's clearly intentional). I suspect that for the other providers it's also more likely to be a security measure than gross incompetence, but it could be incompetence too.\n\nSame with EA launcher, I have to log in every time.\n\nUbisoft never, EVER works. I have to reset the password every single time. It's the reason I uninstalled Valhalla. Between the broken launcher and the absurd load time in the game, it took ten minutes just to start playing.\n\nThe 🏴‍☠️ version of Valhalla works just fine. You already bought it, so it's DEFINITELY not stealing. It also fixes the load time. \n\nJust saying.\n\nUnless I use vpn and change my IP Address, I do not need to log in again.\n\nRockstar Launcher, Ubisoft Launcher and EA Play all make me sign in CONSTANTLY\n\nI'd imagine you'd sigh when you have to constantly sign in!\n\nIf it wasn't for bitwarden, I'd just not bother.\n\nPassword managers for the win!\n\nDude that's nothing. One time Rockstar activated MFA on my account without any input from my end and Rockstar Launcher kept failing silently. It took me contacting their support and them replying a week later that I got to experience RDR2 again. And that too right before the Saint Denis heist.\n\nSame with epic\n\nIt's just another example of a company that cares about users (Steam) vs companies that don't (EA, Ubisoft, Epic). I can't remember the last time I needed to log back into my steam account on PC.\n\nSame, logs me out almost every time\n\nIn 17 years I don't think Steam has ever randomly logged me out.\n\nEA, Ubisoft and fucking nvidia do it every other day of the week.\n\nBinned off Nvidia years ago.. why the fuck do I need two factor to download drivers.\n\nI've started using their new app despite it still being in beta because it doesn't require a login, at least for now.\n\nI use tiny nvidia update checker , it's on GitHub and has a little guide to add it to start up.   Been brilliant for about 2 years now. Might be others out there but this does the trick for me\n\nI really like the new app. They're still bringing stuff over to it but what's there has worked flawlessly for me.\n\n\nAnd yeah, no sign-in for drivers is such a bonus.\n\nWhat if you download 5090, it's to prevent you from it.\n\nWhy do you need two factor to download drivers? I go to the website and download without logging into anything.\n\nIf you want auto updates . Have to download Nvidia geforce, it's some bullshit data collection thing that requires 2fa.\n\nThe Nvidia Experience app, I guess. I never install it either - just get the drivers.\n\nSteam really is the goat. Once when I got a new PC I had to boot up my old one again to remember what my steam login email was, because it had been so long since I had to actually log in manually\n\nYep. Reason 1 million why steam is good and everyone rightfully worships. \n\nIt's not the GUI... It is the shitty fucking asshole company.\n\nSteam logs me out all the time bro, it sucks cuz i never remember my login details and never write them down\n\nThrow in Epic too.\n\nSometimes it does work, but just for one or two more times...\n\nNever worked for me.\n\nIt only \"works\" for me if I launch the Ubisoft Connect directly. If I start a game that needs to launch it then it never works. I can even launch a game, get the window to log in, close it, open the launcher directly and it logs me in automatically. It makes no sense whatsoever.\n\nBillion dollar company btw\n\nI was thinking no way Ubisoft was a billion dollar company, they are 2.4 billion that's crazy\n\nRushing a AC per year is a very efficient money dupe system\n\nTom Clancy (RainbowSix) is a huge money maker too.\n\nI couldn't believe how many Assassin's Creeds there are tho when I noticed them all free on Playstation recently.\n\nOh please, Ubisoft hasn't done annual releases for AC since 2015.\n\nHow is that crazy? Despite what this sub/echo chamber may want to believe, people DO like Ubisoft games and they constantly buy them.\n\nAC Shadows and Star Wars Outlaws will be among 2024's best selling games.\n\nLeague of Legends is owned by a $3.5 trillion company and they can't keep me logged in either.\n\nMe neither! Wtf\n\nNot Ubisoft but I clicked the \"don't log me out for 14 days\" button on my employer's system 5 times on Friday.\n\n  \nI still expect I'll need to log in on Tuesday.\n\nnot just gaming. anywhere and everywhere. maybe 1 or 2 sites it works if you're really, really lucky\n\nI’m an app developer. I can smell a non native app a mile away because of this. It’s always the companies who think they don’t need a real app who pull this. Nothing is as terrible as an app that needs you to log in every time (outside of banking apps).\n\nI didn't know that could indicate an app was non native. I'm guessing that only applies to mobile apps, but how does it tip you off?\n\nImagine some of these apps are basically just slapping a quick wrapper around a website. They don’t know or don’t care to save a token for you (both session and refresh). So it’s just a shitty wrapper on a website. The apps look and perform like trash too. Some of the frameworks are a bit better, but you can always tell something is… off. Especially on iOS, as some of these frameworks are more Android oriented (same with the devs who use them). Most of these devs tell me their frameworks are actually so good, but the ratings are &lt;4 stars.\n\nWait, so some apps are basically a web browser that only goes to the company's website instead of being a proper app?\n\nEssentially. Some are so bad they literally just open up a web view to their website. Others share the UI code, which also sucks. Anything cross platform will be optimized for one place. A shocking number of devs don’t understand mobile. So they build for their web browser, and ship a poorly optimized phone version that just squished content. It’s a way to cut cost, native means having a web, iOS, and Android team. Ultimately though, nothing can hold a candle to the user experience when going native. Companies see $$$ though and will cheap out if they can get away with it.\n\n[deleted]\n\nYeah the size is a huge thing. My old manager insisted that Flutter (a cross platform thing) was the way we HAD to go. Didn’t care about the negatives to performance or massive increase in app size because we were an Ed tech company. Students had no choice, and he claimed that people don’t care about app size because phones have lots of storage. Sure, maybe you buy the biggest storage size but I assume the students couldn’t afford that. I have been running out of space myself and deleted the largest apps. I ended up leaving over that, I provided a mountain of evidence on why it would be bad and he just said “I don’t care”.\n\nI've really enjoyed reading your replies, thank you for taking the time to share your expertise.\n\nDamn, that explains a *fuckload* lmao.\n\nIn case you're finding out about this in general and not only for game launchers, famous electron (this is what they use usually, it's a chromium based wrapper) based apps include Spotify, discord, figma, notion, slack, Microsoft teams and visual studio code, 1password, Skype for windows, WhatsApp (until recently maybe? I think they're the only ones that went back to being native)...\n\nThere's a shit ton. Every one of them another browser sucking resources from you computer, most notably battery.\n\nFucking Electron lol. It seems like it's 90%+ of most app/program sizes that use it, even though they barely utilize the features it includes. Fucking garbage. \n\nNot as bad as react.js maybe, but that's a low bar lol.\n\nMy far cry 5 game started crashing at the main menu so I tried some options to fix it and reset my computer. It then logged me out and I forgotten my password and tried to reset it. No email ever came. I eventually figured out the password but now it’s requesting 2FA which I never set up and the email code never sent either. I’m now in contact with Ubisoft support and they haven’t sent anything in days. Fuck Ubisoft\n\nAs somone that personally prefers just to keep a non-smart cellphone (yes we still exist) the explosion of 2FA and it nearly always being \"this stupid app you now need on your phone!\" is really really really pissing me off.\n\n2FA wouldn't piss me off so much if everyone just fucking used TOTP (the system Google Authenticator uses) instead of spinning up their own homegrown solution that's less secure. Workplaces are guilty of this, too, using Okta Verify and Duo. It's fucking ridiculous.\n\nI've never used the Ubisoft launcher, but feels like a lot of things do that. Like any website one has 2FA thing go off more than feels normal with \"this is my home device, don't require it next time\". Like are software changes (system update, drivers) enough to make it think \"hm, this isn't the same device as last time\".\n\nI'm by no means an expert, just speaking as someone that's used the internet for decades now and keeps up with the news, but I feel like an annoying side effect at the ever-increasing attempts at security is stuff like this.\n\nSeeing as it's ubisoft related, i think the login button is the most useless button here.\n\n[removed]\n\nyou know that's kind of a myth right? \n\n\nlike i've seen some that are questionable if they're hooked up or not. but a big part of my job is going around to various hospitals and office buildings in the city, and probably 90% of them have 'close door' buttons that work almost instantly.\n\nThat is regionally-specific information, friend.\n\nIn most of America, compliance with ADA means that elevator doors are required to remain open for a set amount of time, so the button will not work during that time frame. There are a few places like New York which have laws requiring the close door button work more quickly, but they're the exception. I think throughout the rest of the world the buttons are much quicker than in the US.\n\ni'm in the South East region, and am a medical courier. \n\nthe doors will remain open for a while on their own, but will usually start closing within about 2-3 seconds of hitting the button.\n\nNorthwest region, doors close when I press button. I've never heard of this ADA thing. Hospitals seem more likely to have working closed door buttons than anywhere else and it makes sense. I need this elevator moving.\n\nyeah. one of the places i go is probably one of the more famous hospitals in this region, and has more elevators than any other building i know of. \n\nif you miss an elevator, there's always 6 more right next to it.\n\nSame where I work. I get on as the doors are opening and immediately start spamming the close button so no one else gets on with me. Usually takes a couple of seconds before they start closing.\n\nThey're intended for when the elevator is set to \"individual\" mode (with a key) instead of \"group.\" In \"individual\" mode, the doors will not close at all unless you hold the close door button, and the car can't be called from other floors. I work for a furniture company and sometimes if we've got a big delivery the building manager will set one elevator car to \"individual\" for us so we don't have to fight the regular building occupants for an elevator.\n\nSometimes the close door buttons are left enabled in \"group\" mode but it's rare and I think it violates ADA in the US.\n\nNever works for Battlenet either.\n\nI haven’t had any issues with battlenet signing me out\n\nI went for years without battlenet signing me out, and then one day something changed and I have to log in every. single. time.\n\nThis happened to me for months, then when I reinstalled Windows I logged in and stayed logged in for another few months.\n\nWho knows what circumstances keep your session alive. I highly doubt any software devs at Activision know what's going on.\n\nsame. i have to log in every single time\n\nThat's weird, I haven't had to log in to the bnet app in literally years.\n\nI log in to bnet once when I install windows and that's it. Unless there's some really weird internet disconnection issues in a row or something, that it stays logged out and you gotta go back in.\n\nEpic though, every time. To the point that I just go to the website to grab the free games because I can use the password manager there.\n\nI wish EA and Ubisoft launchers never logged you out ever. It's a security thing but come on, I use that app a few times a year, keep me logged in. If i lose my account, I'll just make another one... eventually.\n\nThat thing on Rockstar launcher would give it a run for its money. Heck, even BattleNet signs you out periodically.\n\nTrue of nearly all the launchers, though I can understand why most of them don't sadly. Nearly all of them use something like a 'cookie' to keep you logged in and eventually those expire. Especially on launchers outside of Steam or GOG.\n\nMore useless than the Diablo 2 Battle.net jewel?\n\nSame for Microsoft logins in certain services. My uni had this page/app where we could book stuff over for free. It has this tick. The amount of this tick working: 0\n\nYea fr\n\nThe issue is that we only log in to Ubisoft connect once every other year. \n\nWe all know it's not needed.\n\nTrue for LoL too, every other time I play I gotta log in\n\nthe riot mobile app is awful. I have to log into my account and choose which games and regions I want to keep up with every time i reopen the app.\n\nThis fucking launcher won't accept my password, but it works on the site. Fuck Ubisoft. I will exclusively pirate their games from now on\n\nUbisoft in particular is very guilty of this\n\nOn Valorant this just straight up does not work for me. I could close the game 5 seconds after opening and it’ll have me login again\n\nIt's even more annoying when it not only logs you out, but also makes you enter a 2fa code 😐\n\n[deleted]\n\nYour hot take is obliterated by the fact that all popular gaming services have 2fa nowadays - be it via email, app or sms. So there is literally 0 reason for the client to require login every 2 days. Take a look at Steam - it is possible to not be logged out for months (if ever?).\n\nProbably going on half a decade here! Thanks, Valve, thanks for not being an annoying dick\n\nAlso, as someone who works on shit like this all the time, this isn’t intentional like cyber guy said. This is just a broken feature that is low priority to fix, simple as that. \n\nImagine all the dev tickets that would exist for a company like Ubisoft, EA, Epic, etc. In the grand scheme of things, a “remember password” checkbox not working as intended is very low in importance\n\nOn my Win 7 machine I had to type my Steam password every time. It would *never* remember me. It only started working when I finally upgraded to W11\n\nIf you went straight from 7 to 11, color me impressed.\n\nI did. I tried to install 10 when it came out and they did the whole \"free upgrade for everybody\" thing but my video card wasn't compatible at the time so I reverted and just never tried again until the W7 machine's CPU shit the bed and I had to build a new machine last year. And since a lot of programs were discontinuing support for 7 (Google Drive and Steam being the main ones I cared about), I decided to actually buy a copy of Windows for the first time in my life and installed 11\n\n&gt; Read up on passkeys and why they are a more usable security concept than passwords.\n\nFor corps, yes, for people NO!\n\ngod I hate passkeys just let me get hacked again\n\nThis didn't make sense to me. Any sensible security policy involving passwords (passkeys are still new so let's ignore them for this conversation) recommends password managers. There's no reason why you need to remember your passwords in today's world other than a couple master passwords.\n\nWhenever a launcher does this to me it's just forcing me to copy my password from my manager just to paste it in, which is even less secure.\n\nSo question about passkeys, every time I get a pop up suggesting I use a passkey instead, I try it and it never fucking works. I’ve never successful logged into anything with a passkey. Is it still early days and buggy or user error? I’ve tried via google and I think I’ve tried via Bitwarden and it didn’t even work.\n\nThe only service I've had an issue with for passkeys is Sony. I couldn't get theirs to work, but everyone else works for me. I use Bitwarden to store it and sync it across my phone, laptop, and desktop.\n\nI haven't typed my Microsoft password in literal years because the authenticator app works so well. Well, I needed to enter it recently to set my PC to auto unlock when I start game streaming with Sunshine/Moonlight. I had no clue what it was. Not a single clue (partly because every time you change it you can never reuse the same password again). I had to reset my password.\n\nHuge fan of passkeys, btw. I use them with Bitwarden. Game changer. Way less painful than 2FA, which is annoying as shit.\n\nAm I missing something or did you not actually explain why it's terrible at actually remembering your password?\n\nAnd how about companies start having reasonable password policies and proper security measures?\n\n\nWhat's up with bullshit like \"Your password must contain 2 lower case letters, 3 capital letters, numbers, special symbols, . and , and be no longer than 8 symbols and not shorter than 7\"? Especially limiting the length on the passwords, do they store them in plaintext and are afraid that password DB is going to take too much space?\n\n\nHow about using salted hash instead, preferably with a computationally hard function?\n\n\nBut even if I use a password like \"WrongParrotCapacitorHolepunch34\" and the attacker knows it's 4 english words with two numbers at the end it's still going to be 100 sixtillion (10^21) permutations to crack. Alas I can't use it, since the website decided to limit their password length to 8 symbols - roughly 10 trillion permutations - assuming the password is actually completely random.\n\nStep 1) Create the problem by requiring a launcher\n\nStep 2) Get frustrated with customer service requests about forgetting their password to said pointless launcher\n\nStep 3) Enshittify said launcher with this bullshit\n\nThat's honestly why I like Google Password Manager. I can use it to create passwords that are a random string of 15-20 numbers, letters, and symbols. Then, if I'm using a Google connected device or browser it auto-fills the password so that I can have secure passwords without them being impossible to remember.\n\nAnd my Galaxy S21 has Samsung Pass which stores the passwords for any apps on my device natively to the device. Meaning, if I'm not correct, they aren't stored in the cloud but rather on my device with them being locked behind my biometrics.\n\nMost, if not all, of my passwords are on Google Password Manager and all the passwords used for my apps are on Samsung Pass.\n\nIf I'm using a device that doesn't support either of those, such as my Kindle Fire, I'll cross-reference Google and just type the passwords in manually. It's the same for if I'm using my Apple TV, my PS5, or my Nintendo Switch.\n\nI'm not sure how safe it is to have my passwords all stored in one location however.\n\nIt’s Ubisoft, what did you expect?\n\nNever works.\n\nThis button right here is the reason I own all the assassins creed games yet haven’t played them. I simply can never remember my password.\n\n    Why can’t I upvote this more.\n\nAs a long time Steam user- I have NEVER had these problems. It’s been consistant with the UBI launcher or whatever the shit it’s called. It’s the only hard part about playing FarCry and AC games: launching it through this shitty app.\n\nI straight-up refuse to play Ubisoft games anymore because of their dogshit launcher.\n\nNah the most useless button is the \"close door\" button in an elevator.\n\nIndeed it's useless, and by the time I use the program again, it's also changed the terms of service \nBums me out man\n\nRandom but this happens with the Dunkin and Panera apps. I think I have like 3 accounts with each now because I use each app once every six months and forget my login\n\nEA’s origin was like that. I hate typing in my password so much I just stopped playing their games.\n\nThe only place this works is steam. What a great app.\n\nUbisoft Connect logs out, EA App has connection and cloud save problems, and I'm glad that I haven't experienced the chaos on the other ones.\n\nand yet, I click that lil fucker every time\n\nIt’s one of the most frustrating things!\n\nNo, the most useless button ever is the elevator close door button.\n\nNah, that actually does work in some elevators, this button always does nothing.\n\nIt never works with any website - ANY of them.\n\nThese things literally make me less likely to spend money at their stores, insane how stupid these companies are.\n\nThat launcher is really2 bad. Omg.\n\nWhile we’re at it, websites need to pick a lane when it comes to listing the first thing as “Email” or “Username”. I can’t tell how many times I go to log in with something and it says “Username” and it ends up just being my email address.\n\nSame with the EA launcher. Every single time I open my PC it makes me log back in.\n\nI check this on anything but I always end up having to log in anyways\n\nUbisoft can suck my fucking scrotum, anyway\n\nYES YES YES HOLY FUCK, this launcher is so fucking trash its not even fucking funny. This is the one con that completely fucking turned me off from buying Ubishit games all in all, its so bad for classic games that you rebought on Steam that you previously owned on uPlay. \n\nIt makes you choose what version you want to play and then relogin. EVERY.FUCKING.TIME. not even Rockstar, 2K, Paradox, Origin, or any other fucking launcher has this issue. Just Ubishit.\n\nI hate that \"Keep me logged in\" checkmark with a passion. Doesn't matter if its for video games, email, youtube, or anything else.\n\nThe amount of times I've had an old person yell at me, **\"I DON'T HAVE A PASSWORD! I'VE NEVER HAD A PASSWORD FOR THIS ACCOUNT! WHY CAN'T I USE MY ACCOUNT?!\"**\n\nTry explaining to someone that they created a password years ago despite the fact they've never typed it a second time. They don't believe you. They don't want you to \"walk them through making a new password/account\" because that's \"unnecessary. Just fix the current one that's broken.\"\n\nIt's emotionally exhausting.\n\nFor real\n\nI tried changing my EA username but it signed me out and I’m too lazy to go through my password book. Titanfall 2 still launches though which is weird since it goes through EA on Steam\n\nTitan fall on a just built different.  Lol\n\nMaybe it works exactly the opposite 🤔\n\nThat flipping button always works but on ubisoft connect it just doesnt i hate this so much!!!!\n\nI thought they just put it there as a joke.\n\nNah, that would be the “share” button on Pornhub.\n\nActually it's a checkbox and not a button, but yeah. 👀\n\n'No, I don't think I will...'\n\nThis happens to me a lot but I have some login issues EVERY time also.  I haven't had them in a while because I haven't touched any Ubisoft game recently, but omg it sucks.\n\nI’ve never used Ubisoft, does it not keep you signed in?\n\nCan someone explain? I don't have ubi client\n\nThose dont work for me on any website. No websites does that work on for me. "

    "all_comment_text": "Now Grant Ward looks even more like Grant Ward!\n\nHa. I remember when his character on AoS just wouldn’t. Fucking. Die.\n\nGrant? Oh you must mean THE HIVE. \n\nLoved how no one trusted him in that computer universe.  They're just like this guy's going to fucking betray us.\n\nProps to the actor for playing 4 completely different (Hero Ward, Hydra Ward, Hive Ward and Framework Ward)takes on the same character but staying believable in each one.\n\nHero ward going to betrayal ward was one of my favourite arcs in tv for a long long time. I so believed in him as a prototypical cookie cutter good guy that when he turned his back on his friends and partners, fuck I was mad at him. Top tier heel turn that nearly gives Hogan at bash at the beach a run for his money, the rotten bastard.\n\n100% agree, I remember it really took me by surprise but it was a great storyline.\n\n[deleted]\n\nSounds like that show went WAY farther than I realized. Stopped watching while he was still Hydra Ward.\n\nwent about 7 seasons further than where you stopped lol\n\nI stopped dairy of the 8th/last season just because I was so burned out by how wacky the plot had become. Whichever season was the end of OG Coulson was probably the best one, and where the show should've stopped.\n\nThat show jumped about a dozen sharks but tbh I was still enjoying it by the end.\n\nI was bummed we didn’t get the spin-off with the couple of characters who had their cover blown.\n\nI stopped in the last season because I just kind of ran out of steam, but the one before that was a pretty good season of Star Trek - The Next Generation wrapped up in a Marvel skin\n\nSeason 4 was amazing so you def missed out\n\nI've considered trying to pick it up again, so your recommendation helps. Thanks!\n\nI second this. Season 4 is legitimately one of my favorite seasons of TV across any show I've ever watched. The framework storyline is just absolutely fantastic and heartbreaking surrounding one character in particular. And the actor who plays Fitz does an AMAZING job that season too.\n\n[deleted]\n\nGreat. \n\n\nNow I gotta watch Agents of Shield all over again.\n\nYeah he got &gt;!His body taken over by an Inhuman god after being killed on an alien planet, and then came back again in a simulation where HYDRA won but he was double agent inside HYDRA this time!&lt; totally not confusing, I know\n\nI really wish they’d have brought Framework &gt;!Ward out of the simulation as an LMD.!&lt; If just to drag the joke on even further.\n\nEdit/also: lmao we’d have seen Ward be &gt;!terrified and suspicious of Fitz, while everyone *but* Fitz is scared of Ward.!&lt;\n\n[deleted]\n\nSquidWard*\n\nIain De Caestecker was also phenomenal for many of the same reasons. That man put on a master class of acting in the later seasons.\n\nAgreed, he was an absolute stand out among a fantastic cast. I've been hoping to see him in something else since, but he seems to be suffering the scifi curse (where you get no major roles after a big one in a single series). \n\nHis King Arthur show looked interesting but I wasn't about to subscribe to MGM+ for it.\n\nKing Arthur was awful IMO. Wasted Iain.\n\n[deleted]\n\nGod he was so fucking good at that\n\nI really loved what they did with Framework Ward. Goes to show that a single change in one's life can really send one down a completely different path\n\nThe Framework season was such a great What If storyline in true comic book fashion before What If became a show. It also made me cry like a baby\n\nJust an absolutely wonderful season of TV. Who would've thought that a Ghost Rider arc would be the worst part of the season. The end of the LMD arc with Self Control was fantastic too (By far the best episode of the series, in my opinion). I loved that they actually titled the first episode of the Framework arc \"What If...\"\n\nSelf Control is just one of my favourite TV episodes of all time\n\nThe ghost rider was pretty awesome.\n\nThe ending of the framework was such a beautiful scene. Radcliffs last words on the beach \"so this is the way the world ends. Not with a bang but with a....\" and then he just vanishes completely, i loved his character so much. They had some really gut punching deaths / goodbyes throughout the show, a spys goodbye when hunter / bobbi are forced to leave shield, talbots death after a season of him being brutalized and keeping faith that coulson was coming to save him was so damn sad. Really was rooting for talbot to be saved but knew it wasnt happening. Oh and of course the one version of fitz dying as well in s5. \n\nSo many people gave up on shield after a boring first half of season 1, but if you stuck with it it became one of marvels best shows ever.\n\nI really wanted Framework Ward to get a real body. I missed having Ward around. Loved every iteration of the character.\n\nAlso thought he would’ve been a perfect Taskmaster. At that time they had absolutely no plans for the character, should’ve let Ward have it.\n\nWe have decided to name him squidward.\n\nExcept now he's the fucking witness in d2\n\nWait WHAT? That’s HIM?!\n\nYep! I just learned recently too. Grant Ward was my most hated marvel character for what he did and then he went and indirectly killed off Cayde 6 too\n\nHe fucking crushed it, too. \n\n“We… I… don’t understand…”\n\nLocal man too handsome to die\n\nsomehow grant ward returned\n\nAge of Sigmar?\n\nMy first thought too, but it's Agents of Shield.\n\nThank you, he who is so wise in the ways of things other than Warhammer\n\nI hate it when people abbreviate shit like everyone *must* know what you're talking about. Just type out the whole name, it ain't that hard.\n\nMy wife almost quit the show during our first run through because he was such a piece of shit and they just kept bringing him back lol\n\ni hated him so much lol\n\none of the top tier mcu villains for sure.\n\nIn the early days the Marvel TV shows' villains were most of the times much better than the movie ones. Ward, Fisk, Kilgrave, Cottonmouth.\n\nI’ve never played this game but as soon as I saw the face on the right I was like ‘wait…Ward??’\n\nThis game actually has some famous actors in it.\n\nBesides Brett Dalton there’s also Hayden Panettiere, Rami Malek, &amp; Peter Stormare.\n\nI don't think Rami Malek was huge at the time of this games original release. He had yet to do Mr. Robot or the Queen movie and such. He's a pretty decent name now tho. Hayden Panettiere and Peter Stormare were probably the biggest names in the game at the time. \n\nHe was still in Night at the Museum so he was still a recognizable face at the time.\n\nMr. Robot had premiered months before Until Dawn came out, and Malek had a number of notable roles in other projects in the years prior, though I agree he wasn't the big name that he is now.\n\nHe was already famous, he just wasn't \"headlining a 900 million dollar movie\" famous.\n\nPeter Stormare is also reportedly playing the same role in the movie adaptation, which they're currently filming. \n\nFucking shit, I'll watch anyth8nf with Peter stormare\n\nHe’s briefly in the Castlevania Netflix show too\n\nSure but would you let him... [&lt;vid&gt; un-pimp your ride??](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0CfSvB_ei8)\n\n[I'd let him do a lot...](https://giphy.com/gifs/americangods-starz-american-gods-l46CvVhZFW0Pw7AkM)\n\nI will watch that if that's the csae.\n\nI remember watching my friend play the game when it came out and when I saw him I was like, \"Wait. Is that Grant Ward? Gawd I hate that fucker!\" and I begged him to kill him ASAP.\n\nI tried to kill him the entire game. The only time he can actually die is a few seconds from the end, and by that point he'd grown on me.\n\nThat's so much Grant Ward, I can't believe it!\n\nDidn't expect to find so many other members of our small but active fan base here.\n\nOur small but active fanbase will never die. 🥲 Or will at least be resurrected as remarkably lifelike robots.\n\nI had a feeling I recognized that face lol\n\nya dawg we heard you like Grant Ward so we doubled Grant up the Ward.\n\nI feel like while the remaster is beautiful, the original looks way more like him.\n\nGlad to see this on top ...\n\nOkay, I'm not crazy. That is Ward. Good to know lol\n\nFor whatever reason the original looks more like him to me. I barely recognized him in the remaster.\n\nNo wonder this made me feel vaguely angry!\n\nIn what world does it make sense to put the remaster on the left and original on the right?\n\nIn a world where engagement is key and you want to bait people to post comments\n\nIf people are getting baited by this they deserve to be baited\n\nOP is a master of baiting.\n\nThe irony is beautiful.\n\nr/afterbeforewhatever\n\nShit... This game is getting a remaster already?!\n\nWait what do you mean it's almost 10 years old?!\n\nThe made the remake because it's getting ported on PC. Might as well also do a PS5 version.\n\nYeah might as well just change the extension to .ps5 while they are at it.\n\nI mean, that still seems far too recent to warrant a remake IMO.\n\nIt might've been the only way they could get Sony to sign off on putting it on PC? \n\nThat alone is pretty huge and makes it worth it IMO.\n\nNoodle on this. The original Resident Evil for the PlayStation came out in 1996. The game cube remake came out in 2002. Only six years apart. If you look at it that way, 10 years for a remaster seems like quite a long time ;P\n\nIn all seriousness though, I still think the original Until Dawn still holds up well today. I’m surprised it’s getting remaster treatment too!\n\nAnd also shows the diminishing return that is hyperrealism in games.\n\nto be fair: elements of Until Dawn either don't age well or are very jank....specifically; facial animations during close-up shots.\n\nplus: Until Dawn is a far more beloved game + coming to PC day 1, so it soften the blow for a bit.\n\nNot really. The new one looks vastly better, and it's still nowhere near movie CGI from 15 years ago.\n\nThe amount of work to make it look that much better versus how much more I enjoy the end product is pretty disproportionate, the original looks fine to me\n\nIt do be lookin good tho\n\nThey are making a movie, so they are banking on it to make some more money\n\nWrites “Original vs Remaster” then posts in Remaster vs Original picture…..how do you get this wrong? Like how?\n\nStandard Reddit protocol.\n\nEnragement engagement.\n\nOhhh this is the first time I’ve heard that. I like it much better than rage bait. Sounds scholarly.\n\nr/afterbeforewhatever\n\n&gt; Writes “Original vs Remaster” then posts in Remaster vs Original picture…..how do you get this wrong? Like how?\n\nIt's on purpose, specifically to attract people like you (and by extension, me and the dozens of other people who have voted on your comment). Your comment is engagement. Just like mine.\n\nYou're probably giving them too much credit to be honest.\n\nOn any other social media platform maybe I'd agree with you, but this kind of engagement is basically useless on Reddit.\n\nIt used to be, 10 years ago. Now reddit is monetized so yes, engagement is *the* purpose of reddit now\n\nwhy did you quote the entire comment you responded to\n\nIt's on purpose, specifically to attract people like you (and by extension, me and the dozens of other people who have voted on your comment). Your comment is engagement. Just like mine.\n\nRight? I was like what's this fucking downgrade and was ready to break out pitchforks\n\nFr i was about to say wow this remaster looks like a downgrade, then i read the photo captions\n\nThat looks quite good actually\n\nThis pic does more to sell me on the remaster than any of the trailers did.\n\nStill not entirely sure it should even exist, but damn it does look like an actual remaster.\n\nIt looks this good because it is a remake. They rebuilt the game from the ground up.\n\nA remaster would have kept the same assets and just touched them up.\n\nThis distinction is important because when company A asks $60 for a remaster and Company B asks $40 for a remake you should be informed that company A is asking more money for something that took less effort to create.\n\nWant a real example?\n\nNintendo wanted $60 for 3 remastered Mario games and Activision wanted $40 for 3 remade Spyro games.\n\nOne of these companies was price-gouging you. Understanding the difference between remaster and remake tells you which one it was.\n\nJust wanted to say spyro is my childhood goat game and was happy it got some attention. I played it a while ago, and it still is a fantastic game for everyone.\n\nToys for Bob knocked it out of the park.\n\nToys for Bob is a great developer, but my god, they went overboard with the difficulty in Crash 4\n\nsomeday i’ll platinum Crash 4…someday\n\nYou sound like me telling myself that one day I'll play all the games that I own that I haven't played. I don't believe me and I don't believe you! But it helps to have dreams, right? Lol\n\nThey’re amazing. I platinumed all 3 and all 3 Crash\n\nThat remake was like they plucked the nostalgia-filter right out of my mind and made it into reality. Like, while playing it I was thinking \"This is JUST how I remember it!\". Of course, the original is very much in the PS1 era graphically. My imagination as a child was just filling in the blanks\n\n&gt;&gt; spyro is my childhood goat game\n\nPretty sure it was about dragons not goats...\n\n...Sorry... I'll see myself out.\n\nJoking aside though, I'm the same for Crash Bandicoot, so I'm glad to see both series getting remakes. And Tony Hawk\n\nWell it did have more goats than most other games\n\nGoat Simulator would like a word. Satan goat will be stopping by soon.\n\nI know nothing about this game but just going off this one picture I’m not so sure about that. \n\nJust look at his collar for example. The shape is the EXACT same, every bend is in the exact same place. Every wrinkle in the fabric of his jacket too. To me this says new textures, same model. \n\nThat’s usually seen in a remaster. \n\nSome stuff looks new. The hair and teeth seem like completely new models for example. The textures are definitely entirely new and not just upscaled. \n\nTo me this seems more like a very high effort remaster than a complete remake. The line gets blurry here.\n\nThey also apparently made story changes and altered the way the games camera works. It is also using Unreal 5, whereas the original was Decima.\n\nI think it probably qualifies as a remake. That is a lot of effort to put in. They are probably using the same meshes where they can, because a lot of the meshes are fine already and there is no reason to duplicate their work.\n\nDecima powered both Horizon Zero Dawn and Death Stranding. It's great when you have the processing power.\n\nSource also has terrible movement to me and it powers Titanfall. It also depends on the studio working on it.\n\nWasn’t Titanfall on a super modified version of the Source engine?\n\nYes they totally remade the render pathline to get those amazing graphics out of it.\n\nThey also completely changed scene direction in some cases, the example shown was the setup prank opening scene had the characters moving and interacting completely differently. Definitely a remake.\n\nOne thing to note is that activision  is only not price gouging us because they literally can’t. Spyro carries nowhere near the weight of Mario, and if it did, they would absolutely hit us for $60 for a slap dash remaster. \n\nNone of these companies are our friends.\n\nThis pic is from the latest trailer\n\nIt exists because Sony are porting some of their old games to PC, with enhanced graphics and other features.\n\nPS5 and PC. \n\nSony are still not done, Gravity Rush 2 Remastered was leaked to be next coinciding with the upcoming movie. That is only playable at 30fps on PS5 in Backwards Compatibility.\n\nI'm good with this.  Some great PS games that I'd love to see come to PC.  Hell, would love to see the Killzone trilogy come to PC, same with the Resistance trilogy.\n\nJust gonna take a quick hit of my Bloodborne on PC copium and then cry for at least 3 minutes.\n\nIt's a really fantastic experience that was hampered by technical limitations and as a result, has a pretty choppy presentation. \n\nI think it definitely deserved a remake.\n\nKinda dumb the original is on the right, at first I thought it looked worse until I realized it's presented backwards\n\nSame! I thought this was another disappointing remaster where they just port it to the latest Unreal Engine with no modifications.\n\nBut yeah this looks awesome\n\nI don't know, I think the director just kept asking for more detail like the guy from Supertrooper kept saying enhanced. It just looks like they added so much detail to his face to appease simple minded people\n\nLike it looks flashier and more difficult, but what is the scene supposed to be? The remaster looks like he has some filming light on him to high light his face whereas the original looks like they're in a muggy warehouse.\n\n&gt;The remaster looks like he has some filming light on him to high light his face whereas the original looks like they're in a muggy warehouse\n\nSpoiler for Until Dawn:\n\n&gt;!Technically, it should be exactly both of those, because the game's first \"killer\" is actually just his mentally ill friend horrifically scaring the pants off everyone for the lulz and for youtube views. In the game you find out that the ill friend is actually a theater student or something and has access to all kinds of stage lighting, camera equipment, and other production tools!&lt;.\n\nWas very confused at first because of the order of the pictures; was wondering why the original looked way better.\n\nBefore , After. The standard until recently. My theory is engagement is higher when the first thing people see is the new thing. Now it's always After, Before.\n\nIt's exactly that. Engagement bait.\n\nEnragement bait.\n\nPlus you get more comments on your thread cause you got lots of people coming in to correct OP. Then there’s even more engagement cause people see that there’s discussion going on.\n\nI’ve noticed this trend in “glow ups” sub. Some people woood reverse it, making it confusing.\n\nr/afterbeforewhatever\n\nr/afterbeforewhatever\n\nAs someone who couldn’t play the original and had to watch it through lets play on YouTube.  \n\n\n\nI’m actually starting to look forward to this.\n\nI started it a few times and stopped playing it, never was a huge fan of those virtual movie type games but finally sat down one day started getting into and just kept taking interesting turns. Quite a solid game for the genre. A really good horror game.\n\nIt makes for a great Halloween event to get a few people over and assign everybody one or two characters and passing the controller around whenever the game shifts to that character.\n\nDamn that sounds like a blast. Wish I had friends...\n\nTo be completely straightforward, I've only gotten people to do this one time and I've been wanting to get them to do it again for years and haven't been able to make it happen. \n\nThis and all of the dark pictures, anthology games, the quarry, are all phenomenal for this.\n\nI do this with my friends every Halloween with the Dark Pictures Anthology. They're the only games my wife likes playing.\n\nWe'll have to revisit this one this year.\n\nLoved the game! I’m chickenshit so it is a miracle I managed to play thru once and save 2. I had a craving to try again but my heart did not let me.\n\n“Original vs Remaster” but then puts the photos opposite.\n\nDamn, and I thought the original looked fantastic...\n\nOn one hand, jesus the detail is something else, on the other hand, are we at the point where graphical improvements in games actually makes them better? Feels like we're grinding for deminishing returns. 8th gen graphics still genuinely look good to me.\n\n[deleted]\n\ngod how I fucking hate when the \"before\" pic is second\n\nTo the people asking why is this being remade, it's because they are porting it to PC and it's being made by a new studio with former developers of the original and it's their first project to get the studio off the ground\n\nIt's being remade in a new engine,  the last one was dated and clearly had tech issues in the original as it was originally going to be a PS3 Move game\n\nThere is also a movie being made amd this will allow new players a chance to play a more up to date version with a non fixed camera and much better graphics\n\n&gt;it's their first project to get the studio off the ground\n\nThat's actually quite nice to hear. I was expecting it to be a \"big studio easy cash grab\" but to know that it was made by the original developers as a chance to kickstart a new business venture sounds awesome.\n\n&gt;It was originally going to be a PS3 Move game.\n\nBiggest bullet-dodge of all time.\n\nOh God, he’s even more handsome!\n\nNot to be pedantic but... its a remake. Not a remaster.\n\nThey rebuilt the game from the ground up. A remaster keeps the same assets and just touches them up.\n\nIdk if I would consider that being pedantic. People commonly use them interchangeably when they refer to two different ways to re do a game.\n\nEdit: was my comment not clear or is your guys reading comprehension that bad? I said it's NOT PEDANTIC to correct people for using it interchangeably. Which means it's the right thing to do to correct the usage.\n\n[deleted]\n\nI can say \"I could care less\" and you'll understand what I meant to say, but I still said the wrong thing.\n\nNo, they usually don't, and they shouldn't. Think of it in terms of music albums. \n\nRemake = you are remaking the album. That would mean re-recording, as in doing it all from scratch.\n\nRemaster = you are remastering the album, as in reworking sound from the original raw source to make a new master recording.\n\nDoes this mean they did the mo-cap again? Like brought the actors back?\n\nNah, its more of a remake in the sense they rebuilt the code and levels in a whole new engine from scratch. They transferred over the voice lines, mocap data and some 3D models from the original.\n\ni wanna see the remastered wendigos sooooooo bad omg\n\nthey were so scary in the dark but looked a little silly (especially in the face) when illuminated, so I wonder how they'll look\n\n  \nchances are those won't be shown in a trailer though\n\nWhen did we start doing right to left for comparisons.\n\nPut. The. New. Ones. On. The. RIGHT.\n\n[removed]\n\nAfter and before\n\nis that Agent Ward from Agents of SHIELD?\n\nIt’s grant ward. He can shoot the legs off of a flea.\n\n\"I'm Agent Grant Ward. I just jumped out of an airplane without a parachute to save your life\" 😂\n\nThat's kinda cracked actually\n\nSweet, I played that game alone in the dark and its vibe is scary as F\n\nThe remaster pic looks over produced as hell. I’m kinda over remasters doing this.\n\nIt looks like there’s a spotlight hitting him from the right, and all of the subtle light and shadow qualities of the original are gone. He’s disconnected from the scene, and there’s a very artificial look about it.\n\nDespite the increased lighting effects and deeper contrast between light and shadow in the remaster, the face’s materials come across as much more fake and with less depth.\n\nThere also appears to be some subsurface scattering in the image on the right, whereas that appears to be absent in the left image, which if these are labeled correctly would be…a choice I guess. A very bad one for a modern game, but a choice nonetheless.\n\nI honestly much prefer the overall quality and direction of the image on the right than the artificiality of the image on the left.\n\nThank you for explaining my thoughts better than I could. Also, the teeth look unnatural, and overall it just seems too perfect.\n\nSame way cars look super obvious in games, the lighting and tires are too perfect.\n\nOk but why are the pictures the wrong way round?\n\nYou had one job OP\n\nwhat the fuck is with After and Before.\n\nIt's *Before* then *After*.\n\nI mean there is a big difference in this picture, but the difference is probably going to be even bigger in the actual game, if you can see multiple frames after each other.\n\nWho puts the new image first and then the old, who hurt you?\n\nThat looks quite good\n\nIt's funny that the left side is how I remember it looking back when it originally came out\n\nPotentially unpopular opinion: original looks better\n\nI think it looks worse in every way except texture quality. It erased the photorealistic atmosphere\nNow it looks just like any runofthemill videogame\n\nBased on the comments it seems we’re in the minority but I’m with you except I think some of the textures are really inconsistent too. Just looking at the face , the textures look all smeared in spots, same with parts of his jacket.\n\nYeah. Right pic looks like a shot from a film if you squint, left looks like...a video game.\n\nStrange art direction, to totally change a game's very recognizable lighting.  \nIt's like slapping a cool blue filter on MGS3\n\nI agree. From this screenshot, the older one looks better to me. The new one doesn't even look like the actor.\n\nRemasters nearly always end up losing a chunk of the art direction from the original in favour of \"more light, more shiny\". Oh well.\n\nHis hair looks huge to me now\n\nThey absolutely butchered the lighting.\nIt looks like an acrylic painting now.\n\nHe looks like he's gotta sneeze lmao he looks sick or concussed. I can't tell when in the game this is but for the remaster's sake I hope its the end. It looks like a cartoon bomb blew up in his face lol he looks dehydrated and emaciated OK I gotta stop. The old one is lower quality but at least he looks healthy. Also that dude is way too sweaty for a windy, snowy mountaintop. Cant wait to play it though haha\n\nYeah its lost that movie like softness the original had. This looks over tuned. The damage on the collar doesn't looks like proper wear now, it's been touched up but without thought to the original vision\n\nI actually like the original better. Resolution is better than the original, but why does the remaster look like he's made of shiny plastic?"

I totally ditched Diablo for good because Grim Dawn is so much better and evolves the way Diablo should have.\n\nNow if only they had an official Linux version of the store, they'd be perfect. I need my library on deck! (I know there are third party solutions, I'd just rather \"official\" ways.)\n\nLike, just games that run native on Linux? Or they should get all the available games, even ones not native to Linux, to run on Linux?\n\nIt sounds like they're just looking for the store app itself to run natively on Linux.\n\nBased on what they're saying about steam deck I'm guessing they want a native GOG program (edit:it is ~~used to be~~ called GOG Galaxy) so they don't have to use stuff like Heroic\n\nBut the steam deck does a lot of the making the games run on Linux if you can get the game installed\n\n\n&gt;it used to be called GOG Galaxy\n\nIt's still called that. It's only available on Windows and Mac, though. I suppose you could try using it with Wine. I know almost nothing about Linux and *actually* nothing about using Wine to run Windows applications on Linux, though, so take that with a grain of salt.\n\nthey probably mean a front end/launcher like steam... you don't have to port games when things like proton exist... I play satisfactory (a windows only game) on linux just fine via steam... works great\n\nLutris works great with GOG would recommend\n\n[deleted]\n\nYeah. Last year I found out that Bethesda delisted the OG Skyrim game on Steam in favor of the remastered one yet I can still download the OG Skyrim.\n\nWe need more storefronts and businesses like GOG who value preservation and ownership of games.\n\nMore people actually *using* GOG would be a pretty dope first step, though.\n\nExactly. They don't need more competition, they need more recognition from the market\n\nThey seem to have made a deal with Amazon and their monthly free games. This is great for GoG.\n\nYeah, I noticed that games that comes with prime subscription have gotten progressively better / higher value than, lets say, half a year ago.\n\nSadly 99% of customers will prefer to buy a game on Steam with DRM rather than a DRM-free version from GOG.\n\n5-10 years late and half the indie games not coming out on GOG make it a poor competitor.\n\nalso the lack of Linux support, which is fantastic through Steam. Valve have earned a very long time of my loyalty with all the work they have put in to make Linux gaming as good as it is right now.\n\n[deleted]\n\nSteam itself is DRM.  It is a very convenient, low risk DRM though.\n\nSteam is a launcher and storefront. If the game is DRM free and on steam, the executable can be launched without steam open.\n\nYes, there is steam DRM, but that's added.\n\nSteam workshop is the only reason I buy stuff on steam over other shops\n\nWhich is standard for any delisting with very rare exceptions.\n\nI think the main thing here is future support. \n\n\nI have some old CDs/DVD games that don't work on mother Operating Systems. \n\n\nThought they were abandonware for the longest time. Lo and behold, GoG had them with patches so they could work! I had to buy them again, but that was fine.\n\nA lot of the GoG patches are fan made and exist outside of GoG, their installer just bundles and installs them for you.\n\nI'm old enough to remember the days we had to manually find, download , and install patches from homemade or sketchy websites. It was the videogame equivalent of unprotected sex in Vegas.\n\n\nGoG having them and hopefully STD test them is a blessing.\n\nFinding a websit that still had the link for Vamps the masquerade patch in  2009/2010 felt like sticking my dick in nuclear waste (it was in the forums of PC General, BTW, but redirected to what looked like the website I made in 2003 on angelfire for free just for kicks.. I was 8..)\n\nBut it worked, and didn't even infect me so...\n\nI'm old enough to remember having to manually find, connect, download, and install patches from official sources. Fuck you Ultima VIII.\n\n[deleted]\n\nThen you get the likes of Rockstar just straight up throwing in \"scene\" no-CD cracks from a title's original release.\n\nIsn't that required of them by law? That you can keep accessing things you bought, even when it was delisted? If not, it certainly should be.\n\n[deleted]\n\n[deleted]\n\nWe need laws for this shit\n\nThere's a [lawsuit](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-is-being-sued-over-the-crew-in-a-lawsuit-that-compares-the-server-shutdown-to-a-bumperless-pinball-machine) targeting Ubisoft right now (over The Crew's reliance on first-party servers that have now shut down making the game unplayable) that compares situations like this to buying a pinball machine only for its bumpers to stop working.\n\nslim head tart seed sip instinctive liquid spark fear rob\n\nI enjoyed Mighty Quest. It heavily advertised creating your own dungeon for players to go through, but it was somewhat limited in that regard. Still, I haven't seen other games do it since\n\nCheck out meet your maker, game with similar idea and really cool world building around it\n\nI loved that game! I built a really difficult dungeon and didn't want to progress though, because even though I could unlock more traps, the players attempting the dungeon would also get new abilities 😅\n\ngod that is such an early 2010s ass title for a video game lol\n\nMore like buying a pinball machine only for the balls to be removed with no way of adding more to the machine but yes good point\n\nIf the company that owns a game stops offering downloads for it under the claim of financial issues, anyone should be able to host it for download.\n\nGames over 10 years old which are not subscription based should be automatically Open Sourced, as any games from studios that go out of business.\n\nOpen sourced isnt the term, that means the entire game's code is out and public which im fine leaving to the creators. We dont necessarily need a game to be laid bare for it to be preserved, and it'd only really be useful for modders.\n\nCongrats, every game is now subscription based.\n\nWell no, because that would include games such as League, Dota, CS, and a host of other multiplayer games that are somewhat managed routinely. Where games that are under Nintendo's subscription wouldn't be eligible for the open source model. So you would see publishers push for it while indie devs would lose profit for something that may still bring profit. A good example is Terraria, which is 13 years old.\n\nWhat may be more beneficial for consumers is a regulation on the services provided. I.e. a publisher/developer cannot distribute a game for X amount of years only for it to be pulled from stores. If a publisher/developer sees fit to close online services, they have the right to do so but while releasing the source code for said game ONLY. If a publisher/developer decides the need to close a games store which consumers bought those games, they must be readily available for that consumer elsewhere without revocation of said good (looking at you Nintendo).\n\nSadly we don't see a push for this from our legislatures (worldwide) because of the deep pockets of lawmakers worldwide. Consumerism right now is at an all time worse, while companies are still making profits. Nintendo being a key player in this with their suit against Palworld. Microsoft is another one who is taking in billions and can easily say \"we'll give x amount of money to the nay voters\".\n\n&gt;Games over 10 years old which are not subscription based\n\n...So you think League of Legends, CS:GO and Dota 2, all currently active games with large playerbases, should be made open source? \n\nWell, that's inarguably an opinion. Also this is your daily reminder that many (many) video game's source code is reliant on code written by other companies, code they very very much do not own.\n\nIf you are in EU sign [this](https://citizens-initiative.europa.eu/initiatives/details/2024/000007_en#). The EU is basically the only hope for any consumer protection rights considering where the US is headed.\n\nWe've reached the threshold for 7 countries! But we still need 600k Europeans to sign it.\n\nEasy if digital products become unavailable to purchase it immediately goes into public domain. That’s what should happen.\n\nImmediate is a bit much, but what I would say would be \"if digital IP becomes unsupported for X years and has not been legally distributed by the rights holder for X years, then the IP moves into the public domain.\"\n\nProblem, ip can be supported and distributed in different ways. Nintendo does not sell super mario bros anymore, but still release mario games. How would that work?\n\n[deleted]\n\n this cannot sustain, the entire gaming industry seems to have nothing but utter contempt for its customer base. and few companies like valve and gog trying to maintain some semblance of fairness.\n\ni can’t draw a parallel where an industry treats their customers like this and not even try to sugar coat the unfettered greed.\n\n&gt;nothing but utter contempt for its customer base\n\nProfit over **everything**\n\nGrowth of profit growth over everything. There’s a reason highly profitable companies like Valve are still pro-consumer… they’re private and don’t have giant investing firms demanding to know why their profit isn’t growing by a greater amount every quarter.\n\n&gt; Growth of profit growth \n\nThats what so many consumers dont get. \n\nCorps dont want _growth_ (the company is bringing in more profit and is growing! thats a good thing), they want the derivative \"growth of growth\" to trend upwards. What an absolutely unsustainable business model, but hey - the short-term shareholders are making a buck so its all good\n\nYup, this and the enshittification cycle are most often found within the shareholder ran corporations since a shareholder is largely insulated from market accountability in ways that a sole proprietor is not.\n\nShareholders can move from company to company like locusts eating fields, while a sole proprietor risks losing everything pulling that.\n\nThe good news is this has a breaking point that we'll probably see in a few decades.\n\n[deleted]\n\nCEO to Board: You know, if we sell a single copy of our new game for $1.2B we don't have to sell any other copies to make our quarterly target!\n\nCEO to Board: You know, if we sell 2.2 million copies of our new game for $1.2B, we won’t have to sell anymore copies to make our quarterly target! (The year is 2071: the EUUSR Union is invading Egypt, digital media is now AI generated on-demand, Florida is swallowed by the sea, Texas left the US and joined Mexico, Wooly Mammoths were revived and ground mammoth is found in every WalMart, and a gallon of milk costs $3 million due to inflation)\n\nDecades? We are seeing it right now. Enshittification has been going on for decades, but now there is word for it because everybody can see it. This is the end of the cycle. Even the US, the bastion of corporations, seem to be eclipsing.\n\nYea the whole idea infinite growth that companies have wanted for the past century is starting to completely implode on itself. The majority of investor class will cease to exist because they take in money without providing any value in return and even worse, they have started providing *negative* value to companies by spearheading the trend of Enshittification which has begun to cause major consumer backlash.\n\nI agree that we're already seeing tangible results. Never in my life have I seen empty shelves in convenience stores because of a deliberate lack of clerks manning the store. There's only so much execs and board members can squeeze out of a business before it becomes untenable for everyone involved. We're seeing the result of the broken social contact.\n\n&gt; The majority of investor class will cease to exist because they take in money without providing any value in return \n\nthis has always been true of the investor class, but they stay in power because they already have power.\n\nThe investor class as we know it is largely a product of the modern stock market, they aren't a group that has always been around and their existence is unsustainable. A class that cannot exist without infinite growth will cease to exist when it becomes apparent that infinite growth cannot be sustained.\n\nI really hope to see this public trading circlejerk destroyed and replaced with something more pro-consumer in my lifetime.\n\npro-worker my friend! both come at the same time! workers consume, workers produce!\n\nIt can't come soon enough.\n\nThat's what happens when Private Equity gets involved. They only own these corps for limited periods where they squeeze them as hard as they can for every fucking penny they can get then sell them off to another PE group before they implode. It's like musical chairs and you never know when the music will stop.\n\nWelcome to unhinged capitalism.\n\nEliminating pensions in favor of 401k's has had a pretty nasty effect on publicly traded companies. Blame the big shareholders driving it all you like, but at least you could conceivably convince a handful of them to make decisions a few years out. Privately traded successful companies can manage this.\n\nAlmost half of the country owning passive shares for the sole reason of their retirement savings going up and not caring about what they own creates its own market pressure. Once something gets that IPO, it's stuck in this cycle.\n\nPensions are a ponzi scheme built upon the idea of infinite growth too though. It works when you have 4 young people for each one that makes it to old age, not so much with ageing populations and declining birth rates. I'm pretty sure things will be *super* fun when we are both old people. Though my country's not 1st world so I'm sure things will suck 1000 more here.\n\nPensions have their flaws too and they don't exactly work in an environment where company loyalty doesn't exist or isn't rewarded. Having the freedom to manage my own retirement funds is awesome, but it's definitely put a pressure on publicly traded assets that the system isn't designed to handle. \n\nI'm optimistic about my old age, but I do believe there's going to be a period of widespread financial hell before then.\n\nValve is unique because the founder still holds &gt;50% ownership and control.  That means the profit question is  answered by one singular person.\n\nThe real issue is that it's private and doesn't have a CEO and Board with the \"fiduciary duty\" to increase (mostly absentee) investors' value. This would be true whether or not it has multiple owners, so long as it is private and has not gone through IPO, etc. At least, that's my understanding as a non-business major....\n\nEven a privately held company can still have a fiduciary duty if that's whole the ownership decides to act.  If you have 100 people who all have a 1% vote, it's that unlikely for 51 of them to decide \"we should maximize profits\".  There's tons of privately held companies that act scummy, like Epic.  \n\nValve has Discworld style democracy: One man, one vote.\n\nGabe is the man, and he has the vote.\n\nHow can we turn gaben into one of those Futurama heads in a jar so he can become president of earth for all eternity??\n\nBeen saying forever. Public trading is poison to the consumer experience. It's the equivalent of selling your soul for capital.\n\nAmazon has repeatedly delisted movies I have purchased and relisted them, the last instance being Young Frankenstein. It's a waste to buy a digital copy of a movie if the purchase isn't guaranteed to last....\n\n\nI miss hard copy media.\n\nThis sounds like it should be illegal unless they stated this explicitly somewhere before purchase..\n\nThe terms seemed to me to suggest you never truly own anything digital from their streaming platform and that they can revoke your rights to those sources at any time. I'm bitter but saw things like that coming.\n\nIt’s the same with video games. Ever since they added the EULA. \n\nYou have purchased a license to play and access the game. You own nothing including assets, data, etc and your access can be revoked at any time if you violate their policies (banned)\n\nThe part about purchasing only a license has been true for decades, even back into the 80s.   \n  \nThe problem we have now is where that license is stored has changed. It used to be with the physical media and/or a CD Key. Now, the license is stored on a server at some other companies' whim, letting them abuse the system. It's awful for everyone but the shareholders profits.\n\nThe death of physical media truly ruined our rights to our games. It's definitely going to kill the ROM industry since that's how people got around the laws forever. \"As long as I have a physical copy, I can have a rom\".\n\nThat’s why gog is so important, they have offline installers which cannot be revoked. This way you own a copy of the game you purchased.\n\nThis is just an incentive to piracy, there's just no way I am personally agreeing to those terms.\n\nThis. They have the right to cancel your rental and make you check it out again. This is what we should be fighting over in congress. Companies are pushing full digital everything and the end users have no rights whatsoever.\n\nThe [user agreement](https://www.primevideo.com/help?nodeId=202095490) says \n\n&gt; i. Availability of Purchased Digital Content. Purchased Digital Content will generally continue to be available to you for download or streaming from the Service, as applicable, but may become unavailable due to potential content provider licensing restrictions or for other reasons, and Amazon will not be liable to you if Purchased Digital Content becomes unavailable for further download or streaming.\n\nBasically says they can do whatever they want and they don't owe you a dime.\n\nI'm more interested in how they can bring it back but then not honor the previous purchase. It's no longer unavailable.\n\nI got an email once saying that season 8 of impractical jokers was going to be delisted and as an owner I am being informed I'd lose access \n\nAnd then it was just never delisted\n\nDid you still lose access?\n\nIf it was relisted then you should have had access to it again through your previous licence?\n\nYeah but this one had barcode 8754292764, while the new one is 8754292164\n\nBooks have their own scam rereleases but this is why ISBN are great things\n\nI'll buy hard copies for as long as they are reasonably available. It's the only way to watch some things, especially the original versions.\n\nAnd there's always 🏴‍☠️ if necessary.\n\nIf buying isn't owning then yada yada you know the rest\n\nMaybe insurance companies,  but yeah... it's pretty shit\n\nPrinter Companies as well. It's not exclusive to games.\n\nTelecoms, concerts, movies, the NFL, Intel 5 years ago, Nvidia now. Hell, even fast food places recently... it's almost more common than not.\n\nSoccer is rife with it. Manchester united has a wage bill that absolutely dwarfs almost everyone else, and they drive sales not because of quality of play, but by sheer value of the quality of players.\n\nIt actively hurts the entire premiere league, and uefa looks the other way despite financial fair play.\n\nThe graph must move upwards, will happen to every company which goes public.\n\nYou mean like the public company that runs GOG?\n\nHousing, insurance, grocery stores, oil companies, a lot of them actually.\n\nI like steam. Most of my games are on steam. \n\nBut make no mistake, it’s still a tool that licenses you to play games. You don’t own any game in their platform. If they ever shut down or be pushed out of your country (like, for example a stupid social media bill) then say bye bye to your library.\n\n&gt; i can’t draw a parallel where an industry treats their customers like this\n\nMost industries are like this. The difference is that most costumers in industries feel no special connection to old products or the companies behind them, so the consumers act apathetically when a company makes changes in the names of profit maximizing, either simply moving to an alternative or living with the worse solution that the company has offered.\n\nGamers care about game preservation and they put an emotional stake into the companies that make the products, so they’re in a position to be hurt when the companies act like companies. Ultimately, unless prevented by law, companies will do whatever they can to maximize profits, reduce costs, and maintain full control over their IPs, even the ones they aren’t using. Although there are some good actors who serve as exceptions to the rule (mostly smaller companies. Indie game devs are a good example of that because many are in it because they love making games rather than wanting to maximize profit), that’s the overall reality across most industries.\n\nExactly, piracy is the only true game preservation tech\n\nPiracy and emulation.\n\nI think the industry can sustain 30 year old games no longer being sold.\n\nAs of right now they aren't even no longer being sold. You can still buy OG warcrafts through Battle.net. \n\nBig Caveat on that though. Blizzard might still delist them there, but currently they have not.\n\nGog is a great platform man, wish more companies took pride in game preservation.\n\nAbandonware sites are crazy. Basically non profits hosting games you'll find nowhere else.\n\nOn a related note: Anyone *genuinely interested in preservation* should be keeping tabs on the Video Game History Foundation - VGHF.\n\nThey've been doing amazing things for preservation, with real historians applying professional academic rigor to the work. Beyond that, they've pretty much finished a several-years effort of digitizing games magazines and are now working on a platform to create a library for public access (I am so excited for this). [This is their video previewing their library](https://youtu.be/WUaUXAE1nTM)\n\nThey also have a podcast which is SUPER fascinating, bringing in all the niche specialists independently studying and curating video game history for their insights.  They've collaborated with several studios to help preserve behind-the-scenes materials. Buying their duplicate blind boxes of donated gaming mags makes supporting their efforts uniquely rewarding. It's just a really great thing they're doing and I am crazy jealous of anyone who has the skills and good fortune to work there.\n\nIf you love video game preservation and aren't keeping up with VGHF, you're missing out.\n\nyeah preservation is saving a copy, logically with a reputiable historian, and logically they wouldn't share it with anyone till the item hits public domain, for research purposes, or till it becomes abandonware.\n\nGoG is the only digital distribution I’ll buy games on. Your games are not locked to your account.\n\nI just wish developers would stop ignoring GOG releases when updating their games elsewhere. \n\nThat said, I do prefer to just get my games in a state to begin with where any updates would be unnecessary. But sometimes games do huge expansions for free, and an infuriating number of devs don’t push those updates to gog\n\nIf gamers would stop ignoring GOG, then developers and publishers would too.\n\nI bought John Woo's Strangehold on GOG and I downloaded it once. Haven't been able to find it since then sadly due to me using a random email\n\ngaze complete deliver quicksand snow butter exultant silky merciful wild\n\nYeah, I mean, I bought it about 2-3 years ago. I went back on there cause that's literally the only game I've gotten from the website, and it wasn't there in my library. Only paid like $3 though so it's not a huge deal, just weird. \n\nGonna buy it again though now it's only $2 lmao, thanks for the link homie\n\nterrific obtainable shaggy scary childlike sable weather reminiscent north jellyfish\n\nI'm going to say that you are misremembering something because this is really not possible. You should have the sales receipt in your email and I'm betting that it isn't there. Happens to me on occasions too where I'm positive that I have bought a game many years ago but can't find any evidence of it.\n\nYour soundcard works perfectly.\n\nI haven't even thought of this voice line in over 20 years and yet I can hear it clear as day.\n\nI think that means I'm dying.\n\nClick it...again?\n\nWhy...why did we continually click it to test.  Was I the only one??\n\nYea I refuse to buy anything from Blizzard after they took my WC3 for their new version.\n\nYou can still play WC3 with your old CD keys. \n\nBut they did absolutely shit the bed with reforged.\n\nYou can play the original WC3 with the keys?  From what I remember, if I tried to download Warcraft 3, it just downloads reforged, but not the original. Unless I use the discs to install.\n\nI think if you already had the original games on your account you can go into a weird corner of your account page on their website to find them. It’s how I can play the original D2 release. But there are definitely a few extra hoops compared to just downloading it from the launcher.\n\nOriginal WC3 got Reforged patched into it so you have to play that version if you want battle.net\n\nYou cannot play multiplayer games through Battle.net unless you have reforged. That basically means that if you have the old versions, and didn't purchase reforged, then Warcraft 3 is a single player offline game.\n\nFor most veteran WC3 players still wanting to play to this day, the campaign is not content they care about anymore. It's all about custom games and online PvP through Battle.net. Therefore, this restriction is quite frustrating and seems unfair to many people for obvious reasons.\n\nIf you figure out what the way to get the original one is, that would be great.  I don't think the original battle.net service for WC3 is running still though, right?\n\nSame bro, same.  But age of mythology’s remaster is good enough!\n\nAge of Mythology Retold showed them how it was supposed to be done!\n\nI still miss Overwatch.\n\n[deleted]\n\nGOG is the real MVP when it comes to old games. Everyone loves steam but GOG will always have a special place in my heart.\n\nI'm sure nobody will see this comment, but to spend the last 30 years watching a company made by gamers for gamers turn into this detestable monstrosity really hurts my soul.\n\nFuck Activision.  Fuck Bobby Kotick.  And fuck Microsoft.\n\n[deleted]\n\nI see your comment. I see you. We see each other.\n\nYeah when I grew up Blizzard was like *the* paragon of great games and stuff\n\nSad to see what happened honestly\n\nBrings me back to days of Westwood Studios. I just replayed Red Alert 2 (both campaigns; and Yuri's Revenge) and I found it still held up quite decently.\n\nBesides a few months on World of WarCraft I haven't played a Blizzard game really since the original Diablo II. Most of the team that made Blizzard what it was moved onto Hellgate: London around 2005 and that unfortunately tanked the newly formed team of old Blizzard devs. People hoped against hope with Diablo III, the Activision merger, etc., and I don't understand how the company keeps on kicking outside of World of WarCraft. Blizzard killed most of its former good will that consumers had for the company.\n\nAnd corporations are shocked when people pirate their stuff…\n\nI had stopped pirating for over a decade. \n\nNow I can't even get some media even if I want to pay for it.\n\nThey have forced my hand honestly. YO HO!\n\nI'm tired boss...\n\nSeriously, same. I HAVE money, I WILL pay for them! Just… SELL THEM TO ME. Don’t make it harder!\n\nAbsolutely blows my mind that companies do this shit. I mean I guess if they plan to redistribute it later themselves? But fuck, don’t sit on them lol I’ll just go find them one or another.\n\nEven if you buy a media you would get a cd-key (or embedded key in the cd) that would need you to link it to an account from their launcher.\n\nDRM all the things!\n\nI think my last AAA was like CoD modern warfare 2.\n\nEverything else is from \"small\" studio.\n\nBoth because they are the only one creating new games AND being fine on the price side.\n\nThis is why I love GOG\n\nWhat a bunch of a-holes. Keep shoveling shit like D4 and CoD after the Acti merge and delistong the og games that were actually good. I was done with Blizzard long ago.\n\nUnfortunately, people are buying that slop in record numbers, so nothing will change.\n\nOne store Mount made more money than StarCraft II.\n\n[deleted]\n\nShareholder see numbers go brrrr\n\nStarcraft 3? Nah. MOUNT 2 🤑🤑🤑\n\n[deleted]\n\nI'm pretty sure when they added warcraft 1 &amp; 2 to Warcraft Reforged as a bundle, they let people choose between original and remastered versions. So them taking these off GOG is just keeping people on Battle.net (which Microsoft is trying to turn into a legit storefront and not just Blizzard - not sure how I feel about that) - not making them inaccessible. \n\nI mean its a normal practice for gaming industry when a remake comes out the og get delisted sucks but it has been normalised long time ago\n\n GoG being awesome.  Blizzard being shitty.  Status Quo.\n\nJust made my first purchase on gog!\n\nFYI, in case you didn't know:\n\nYou can download \"offline backup game installers\" from [your GOG account page](https://www.gog.com/account). That way, if, somehow, you lose access to your account or GOG goes under or something, you'll still have access to your games.\n\nAlso, with some games you buy, you'll get some neat bonus stuff like a soundtrack or an artbook or something. You can also download those from your account page. (Warcraft I includes the game's soundtrack and a PDF of the game's manual. Warcraft II includes desktop wallpapers, something they call \"community maps\", and a PDF of the game's manual.)\n\nAlso also, if you like achievements, you can use GOG Galaxy (GOG's completely optional game launcher) to play your GOG games. Many games support achievements.\n\nI know you didn't ask for any of that, but I just wanted to point out some info I thought was neat about GOG.\n\nIt's also a great way to play that library on time accurate hardware!  I have a few XP era games on my XP rig, plus WC1 set up with DOSBox on the same machine.  The offline installers work just fine on XP.\n\nI keep forgetting how good GOG is, I really should be buying from them more. Steam ends up being my default.\n\nI get this, especially if you’re trying to play on steam deck, but if you have the space you can literally save the installers for the future \n\nBlizzard being shady?  In 2004, this would be shocking.  In 2024, this is normal for Shizzard.\n\nIs it too late to buy?\n\nArticle says the games leave GoG on December 13, so there is still time to buy them on GoG.\n\nGlad I randomly decided to buy Warcraft 2 not too long a go\n\nNo, and you can use the code MakeWarcraftLiveForever to get $2 off until Dec. 13.\n\nyou can buy them before December 13. After that they are gone.\n\nGood guy GOG\n\nGenuine W for game preservation.\n\nBlizzard sucks\n\nMan I wish I used gog in the past.\n\nNever too late to start.\n\nI downloaded it lol. Apparently I got a couple games from humble bumble in the past.\nPut I do have Amazon prime and that comes with gaming so I think I can get codes from it.\n\nYes, Prime gives out codes for games on GOG all the time. In the past couple months I’ve gotten 10 free games from them alone, and GOG will usually have freebies that they hand out during sales as well. \n\nKeep in mind on GOG, you don’t have to use Galaxy - their launcher - unless you want to. A few multiplayer games might require it but all single player games can be played and installed with their offline installers.\n\nGame companies are starting the war on emulation and content preservation, it's all thanks to good ol' Nintendo.  \nNo other media has this much hate for it's own consumer, no other media tries so hard to prevent you from keeping an archive.\n\nSports media does. Their nonsense also bleeds into gaming.\n\nHey Blizzard, have you all ever tought about sucking a cactus ?\n\nThey should try one as a suppository.\n\nYou mean they will continue with the contract they agreed to with Blizzard and GOG customers.\n\nwhats up with game companies trying to delist their old games? I love playing older games and it saddens me that when theyre trying to pretend it doesnt exist like with unreal\n\nThe real reason Here IS that Blizzard Released remastered Versions of These 2 Games and they are trying to force people to buy These remasters through battle net at an increased price, so they forced gog to delist the original Versions.\n\nThank you GOG for fighting for games preservation. 👏\n\nFuck blizzard\n\nOG warcraft dam what memories playing this as an 8 yr old. Still remember it to this day.\n\nWhy would they delist it? Seems like such a petty move.\n\ncould you imagine a world where you couldn't hear a classical piece ever again?\n\nI'm high as fuck eating an ice cream sandwich while reading this. So\n\nHell yeah! Good for them.\n\nOr\n\nSelfish fucks, burn em all down.\n\nHigh or not, you're on point.\n\nI didn't know they were on GOG, so thank you!\n\nOnly support fair companies that treat you right as a consumer !\n\nDeal on gog seems to only prefer certain currency.\n\nIt won't work for Canadian funds\n\nI still have my disks but bought a copy just to support GOG. Heroes in the face of villains.\n\nI mean after blizzard stole my copy of OG WC3 from me by simply pulling the ol' switchero with their chinese mobile game bullshit replacement, I think straight up piracy is justified. Buying on gog after blizz stops seeing profits is a good second though.\n\nSo GOG does the work to get these games up and running on modern hardware, keeps them updated, puts them in part of their advertising for their new initiative to preserve it, and then Blizzard ends GOG's licensing after five and a half years.\n\nShould we start a betting pool on how long it takes for it to show up on Blizzard's website for at least twice the price?\n\nMy best bet is a couple weeks ago when they Released the remastered Versions lol."

    "all_comment_text": "There's a lot of easter eggs in the game. In Rostok there's a wall that says \"Get out of here stalker\" in Ukrainian.  In the first game there was a Duty member in the same room who'd say the same thing over and over at you that it became a meme\n\nAlso found a spot in Yantar where in the first game corpses were leaning against sandbags, while in STALKER 2 there are skeletons in the same spot\n\nSay what you want about the performance issues, bugs, etc - STALKER 2 is truly a labor of love towards the original games\n\nin Agroprom underground there's the skeletal remains of the bandits and military Strelok killed in SoC too\n\nThat's awesome! I need to visit there, it's one of the few classic locations I haven't been to yet besides Pripyat.  I replayed the original trilogy right before STALKER 2 came out, it's really surreal seeing all the old locations with graphical improvements and no loading screens\n\nThe subtle little considerations of continuity have been awesome. \n\nI really hope they're able to smooth out the kinks and let the game really show what it can do\n\n&gt;STALKER 2 is truly a labor of love towards the original games\n\nand it current jankiness brings me back to originals even more. Im sure 2 will be fixed after all but current state has its vibe.\n\nThe jank does really match. I remember playing the first one, and not being able to save in I think the red forest, because the map name had a space in it. The save game function used the map name as part of the saved game filename. The save game loader couldn't handle filenames with spaces in them. So you couldn't load any saves from the red forest.\n\nUnit tests, who needs them\n\nUnit tests would not find errors like that. Both units are working correctly and according to their corresponding contracts. It is integration problem, when two distinct parts of a system assumed different invariants.\n\nI feel it's jank is actually not terrible. So far I've had a wonderful time. Just performance issues in towns.\n\nI would agree with you EXCEPT for the nonsensical spawns.  The amount of time nobody is around you and then suddenly spawn in behind you or even in front of you... it's not acceptable.\n\nLiterally the worst spawning bugs I've ever seen in a full priced game... maybe any game.\n\nI'm not sure how it works now, but at the start that's how police spawned in Cyberpunk 2077 — right behind you or around the nearest corner. They would also spawn indefinitely unless you run away.\n\nIt's kind of a miracle it even released, I thought for sure it would be cancelled or delayed infinitely\n\nIt's one of those things where I am just patiently waiting for it to show off it's full potential. It may take a bit, but I'm excited to spend some time in a year or two playing the game.\n\nThat's very fair! I'd been waiting for STALKER 2 since before it was originally canceled around 2012ish, so couldn't wait.  Hope you enjoy it when you're able to play!\n\nThe boat in the tutorial with the music is the same boat from the first area of COP. I'm not sure if that's an Easter egg or just reusing an asset though.\n\nThe one with the radio and the poltergeist inside? Yeah I noticed that was very similar to the ship Beard tells you to grab that Ships wheel artifact from in CoP\n\nThat boat from COP is also in Zaton here, but it's missing the small docks next to it.\n\nThe one in tutorial is just the same model reused.\n\nThe performance issues in this game are nothing to scoff at, but it’s not some sort of surprise result that we haven’t seen recently—even from AAAA studios.\n\nETA:  [AAAA games](https://kevurugames.com/blog/what-is-a-aaaa-game-from-concept-to-controversy-in-the-game-industry/) aren’t a new concept, but instead a known marketing tool used to justify charging players more than typical retail prices.\n\nSpecifically, I’m referring to starwars outlaws, as its reviewed and released build—[Gregg Wheeler’s AAAA review of the AAAA game linked.](https://www.thereviewgeek.com/starwars-outlaws-gamereview/)\n\n&gt; AAAA \n\nPlease don't normalize this.\n\nPersonally I am in favor of it. Once AAAA becomes normalized, marketing will have to move to AAAAA, and the cycle will begin anew. Eventually, games will be marketed as AAAAAAAAAAA, a term that will perfectly match the noise that customers make as they desperately try to figure out what any of the marketing terms mean while deciding what to buy.\n\nnew tier of game : Sly Marbo\n\nI love how, little by little, 40k has crept up into mainstream pop culture. We must enjoy this era while it lasts. Praise^the^Emperor\n\nIf the emperor had a text to speech is canon. Prove me wrong, heretic.\n\nHow can I disprove the holy scriptures, brother? It would be a sin. Lets us bask in its golden splendour.\n\nA^(3), A^(4), …, A^(ω), A^(ω+1), A^(ω+2), …, A^(ω·2), A^(ω·2+1), …, A^(ω²), A^(ω²+1), …\n\nAAAA is a known marketing ploy used by publishers to try and justify pushing pricing.\n\nIt currently is not likely to be viewed as a sign of quality.\n\n&gt;It currently is not likely to be viewed as a sign of quality.\n\nI disagree. I see it as a pretty solid sign of low quality.\n\nI agree. People should definitely get a little more outraged that this is the norm. But alas, normalizing it makes it acceptable.\n\nAlso funny because this game is way less buggy than the previous vanilla games so far for me. It's been the norm for a long ass time in slavic games to have a lot of jank, and the norm in general for huge open world games to come out with issues. At least I don't have a bug report flashing up and crashing my game every so often. The stuttering I fixed with one mod https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/133\n\nThe difference of course is outlaws doesn't deliver on the title but boring Ubisoft lawn mowing.  This does.\n\n[deleted]\n\nThis sort of stuff has convinced me to get it when I have the cash. I am so glad the devs cared.\n\nIronically that dude has some of the best NPC trading.\n\n\"Get out of here sta-\" \n\n\"Yeah, yeah I get it. Want this weird anomaly I found?\"\n\nThere is also a Harry Potter easter egg in the Swamps. Wonder why, maybe someone at GSC really likes it.\n\nperformance issues?! Game runs like a damn dream and I'm on a 2070\n\nWhat settings do you play on? I've got a 5700 xt and it was running pretty well on medium and after an hour it turned into a slide show, im talking 5-6 fps.\n\nThere's a memory leak in the game AFAIK.\n\nAn hour sounds like a good fit for a problem like that.\n\nProbably something the devs will fix quickly.\n\nmaybe you only dream nightmares?\n\njust like all the other stalker games, there is also a body armor hidden in the rafters of a house in the starter area\n\nI never made it through the first one, but Stalker 2 is a masterpiece even without the homage to the original. The critics are tripping.\n\nThere is so much attention to detail and continuity from the first game. It is obvious that they put a lot into this game.\n\nThey did a similar thing with Gordon Freeman, where you could originally find his fresh corpse in the first game, you can find a skeleton with the Half Life crowbar.\n\nI couldn’t get the input lag to go away long enough to enjoy anything. Hopefully they patch soon\n\nI had really bad input lag at first too, was terrible and I struggled to even track fleshes. I turned off Vsync and Frame Generation and it went away.  Hope that helps you too!\n\nI just got such a rush of nostalgia seeing that main menu.\n\nI can hear the theme clear as day: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1siPgAVOAtU\n\nThe soundtracks for the stalker games and the [C&amp;C tiberium sun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qq8PTCxuzTA)/firestorm games really did bleak well.\n\nIs the original worth playing or does it show its age? I cant afford stalker 2 yet but I'd love to play it\n\nIt's worth playing but it DEFINITELY shows its age.\n\nDefinitely still worth playing, but it does show it's age. I replayed the original trilogy right before STALKER 2 came out vanilla just to refresh myself.  Shadow of Chernobyl and Call of Pripyat are the ones to play, Clear Sky is the weakest of the series.  There's a very active modding community for the franchise too\n\nClear Sky might be the weakest but the grenades are the strongest.\n\nThe grenade memes are real. I had 3-4 grenades getting tossed my way at same time by the Monolith towards the end of the game\n\nI'm playing it right now, figure by the time I get through the series to Stalker 2 it'll be in better shape.  If you go to the stalker subreddit the sidebar has links to the ZRP mod which fixes the games flaws but leaves it pretty vanilla still.\n\nflowery governor special depend practice seemly historical subsequent close languid\n\nHow do people remember these details is beyond me. I can't even remember what i ate yesterday.\n\nThe original game crashed so often you got to know the title screen pretty well. \n\n\n(Only kidding. I don't actually remember that many crashes. The bugs were usually minor and funny)\n\nIt really depends when you played it. When it first released you could pretty much crash it on demand and bugs were far from minor. The first time I finished the game I wasn't even sure I did it the intended way cause scripts were breaking on me left and right.\n\nI'm playing it now with the ZRP \"unofficial bugfixes\" and it crashes every time I try to consume something from a dead guy's inventory :)))\n\nWhen I played, I completed the Find Strelok just outside of the opening area. There was a dead body on the ground and checking it solved the quest. Never did get very far in that game, either.\n\nYeah. Played it day one and some games feel like you are walking on egg shells and you sorta developed a sense for buggy and janky game navigation. Felt strange to finally make it to CNPP after all that. I'm sure the major quest related stuff in S2 will get sorted out pretty quickly.\n\nyep... I remember how I still ignored all the jank and had a great time with it around 2011. My dual-core pentium laptop sure hated me for it.\n\nStalker 2 brings back the nostalgia with my PC struggling to keep 60fps lol.\n\n&gt; The original game crashed so often you got to know the title screen pretty well.\n\nOh shit, I think you just discovered the second homage to the original!\n\nI don't know if anyone will believe me, but I just got done with a playthrough of SoC and only crashed once. Completely vanilla. I was surprised. It wasn't really buggy either.\n\nI started the Stalker serie with Clear Sky, on disc, without internet. Let me just say that I had way more crash than deaths in this game, and I played for tens / hundreds of hours... Yeah, without patches, it was that bad, could get a crash every 15 minutes or so.\n\nTbh I think SoC and CS have particularly memorable title screens, the music goes pretty hard and the image, which is also animated, fits kt pretty well\n\nWell, as has been stated, I did crash to that screen quite often. Between the OG games, modding them out, playing Anomaly and Gamma with OG menu mods installed.... It's left an impression.\n\nSome of us never left the Zone, and revisit the games and all their mods regularly. Before the second game's release I would say the stalker community was made up almost entirely of hardcore vets that stuck around.\n\nThe internet is like the infinite monkey theorem. There is just a lot of us here, and someone somewhere is bound to notice.\n\nAlso, different folk have different type of memories. Some are good at memorizing people's face, other are good at remembering concepts, relation, or words. Personally, I'm great at remembering 20 years old embarrassing moment with vivid details.\n\nGotta restart the game every 20 minutes so plenty of opportunity to see the menu screen :D\n\nif there was soldier standing in a foggy background i’d immediately recognize that as the cod 4 menu ha\n\nIt was iconic, you'd remember your favourite game.\n\nWith these old games? Having stared at them for years. We didn't have as much choice of games before Steam.\n\nvery cool, where abouts on the map is this?\n\n+1, where is this place? I need it\n\nThat looks like CNPP in the background, and the plant is in the upper part of the map kinda near SIRCAA, so I would assume somewhere up there, looks pretty close to the cooling reservoir for the plant\n\nWait till you find the archway that's also a reference to the first game, and then you do what I did and run through it assuming it's a pathway down to the town...\n\n1. I think they intended you to find that right out the gate because it's along the main quest path and the player is pretty sparsely geared at that point so you're just aching to get to town ASAP\n\n2. Lol, did you ignore the signs? I was tempted to walk through then I looked at the signs, contemplated how the rest of the world was designed, and realized that the signs were meaningful and not set dressing.\n\nMe seeing radiation signs: \"well ya, post apocalyptic wastland, those are probably every where, and the random radiation ticking happens all the time, ill cut through this junk yard...\"\n\n*frantically taking anti-radiation as I sprint back out of the junk yard*\n\nK, signs mean somthing.\n\nIts my first stalker game, need to play the first one with how good this one is so far. Got like 2000hrs in dayz and i used to play tarkov so lots of items and mechanics make sense and click for me... except the signs apperently lol\n\nHey there’s signs warning you about the mines in tarkov. Just pretend the radiation signs are telling you the same thing lol\n\nYeah.... im just dumb. Luckily i only was dumb once, or twice... learned you only need to fall 6ft to die too lol.\n\nBeen having a blast with the anomolies, going with no guides or looking up tips has been fun too. Learned you can slowly move through those shredder anomolies without getting hurt (no idea what to call it). Found out by looting a body, was sneaking around, didnt realise i walked right into the middle of one, thought it popped up out of no where and i was gonna die, i just kept crawling and it kept working!\n\nSeeing that archway overlooking Zalissya and the wider zone beyond and instantly knowing it from the old promotional material... Man, it brought a big smile to my face.\n\nHmm, the text in the top screenshot says, \"Вона не відпускає\", meaning, \"She is not letting go\" - does that have some significance?\n\nUkrainian native speaker here.\nA more correct translation would be \"Zona (it?) will never let (you) go\"\nAnd yes, this means exactly that if you have been a stalker once, you will remain a stalker forever.  It is also a reference to the fact that we are back in this game, in the same place as in the good old days.\nAny more translation questions?\n\nAh, thanks. \n\n(Я якраз українську сам знаю - але давно вже не грав і забув про зону, то й думав, хто ж там не відпускає?)\n\nIsn’t that also a reference to the book? The zone never letting you go was a theme in roadside picnic iirc.\n\nI'd love to see a Ukrainian native speaker put out a video going over all the little easter eggs and lore and such and translating them to english for us non Ukrainian speakers. Thanks for the clarification on this one though.\n\nAlso, slava Ukraini. I hope the orange idiot we put in office in the US does better for Ukraine than everyone expects. I fear I will be disappointed, but here's hoping...\n\nProbably has something to do with the Zone and you, the player, coming back to it after all those years.And the word \"zone\" is gendered female both in Russian and Ukrainian, so it makes more sense to a native speaker (\"she [the Zone] doesn't let go\").\n\nEdited to fix a typo and add a clarification.\n\nЗона а не «вона»\n\nThe area in the game, called \"The Zone\" canonically has an alluring appeal to a lot of people, and often even when they plan or want to leave, things either turn out to make them stay longer, or they just don't want to return to the mainland because they're enamored with the life there.\n\nI walked into Cordon yesterday, and when I realized I was in the starting area from the first game I lost my shit.\n\nLast time I played a STALKER is at least 5 years ago, probably closer to 10.  \nI could draw you a map of Cordon in 3 minutes. Including 3 tunnels, the bandit complex, the newer anomaly building, the farm, 3 checkpoints, bunker, hamlet...\n\nMayhaps my memory is screwed...I played 10 years ago and I can hardly remember any of the details. :(\n\nI spent quite a while standing in place at the start of the game, staring at the map and recognising locations. I spotted Cordon so fast, but saw other places in Garbage, the village area in Wild Island and a few other places.\n\nSome are so unchanged they're instantly visible, others are recognisable but altered, and some additional areas are interesting to explore.\n\nPlaces I couldn't quite spot was the woods area, not the red forest, but the place down the bottom right, and the swamp looks different.\n\nwell that's a cool easter egg.\n\nHow have I never heard of any of these games are they good what are they about?\n\nStalker are horror survival games with RPG elements set in \"The Zone\", which is the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone that was established after the nuclear disaster in 86. While it is a shooter, you have to manage your inventory as you can only carry so much, pay attention to hunger, weapon condition, armor condition, and exposure to radiation.\n\nEnemies include humans such as bandits and mutants. There also also anomalies that are present which can hurt you.\n\nStalker 2 (top picture) , was just released on November 20th on PC and Xbox. I'm on Xbox and overall I'm really enjoying it. I would recommend it, but maybe give it a few months for some updates as it's a bit rough right now. Stalker: Shadow of Chernobyl was the first one released in 07 if you want to dip your toes in to see if you like it.\n\n&gt; Stalker are horror survival games with RPG elements set in \"The Zone\", which is the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone that was established after the nuclear disaster in 86.\n\n“The Zone” is the result of a second explosion at Chernobyl in 2006, not the initial incident in the lore\n\nStalker 1 will never be replaced in my heart. I also found this while playing a few days ago and it made me quite emotional.\n\nFound...more like taken straight from a youtube video, you didn't even bother to hide the text lol\n\nHere's the video: https://youtu.be/BBZQIeKgZqc\n\nCan you loot the gun?\n\nBased on the white dot on top of it, you can!\n\nDo they still say cheeki breeki regulary? Otherwise unplayable.\n\nProbably well known by now, but there’s a stash in the spot were you could get the merc armor in SOC\n\nsoo... could I run this on a GTX1070?\n\nI wouldn't risk it. Unless they make significant optimization gains with coming updates I don't see how that GPU could run the game at an acceptable framerate for an FPS. Cards with 8gb Vram aren't very suited at the moment. 10 gb Vram is where it starts to get noticeably better.\n\nYou should give it a few patches before you worry about it. It's AI spawn system is broken as well as something called A Life which is supposed to be the driving force behind making The Zone feel alive. It still needs some time before it really shines.\n\nThat being said, I'm running it on a 1080 on medium settings (with hair set to low). So you might be able to get away with low settings.\n\nI run it on a GTX 1070 and i7 7700k on mostly medium settings.  Everything shading-wise is set to low, and using XeSS upscaling to get a playable ~45fps in most areas\n\nI've run it on my 1070ti and a i7 4770, everything on low besides textures (on medium) with XeSS and it's fairly playable. In towns it can be a bit choppy, but outside of them it runs fine.\n\nI can the game on all low and upscaling at „balanced“ at about 50-60fps on my 2060 and r7 3700x. It runs good for the most part it’s just that it isn’t stable at all. Indoors or in villages I get 30 fps and every minute or so it drops down to 5-6 fps. I would wait for patches\n\n[deleted]\n\nSad to hear it. Fells like a game to get on sale after 6 months of patches and extensive modding.\n\nAnyone else find the car in the willow in the swamp that looked like a harry potter reference?\n\nNice!!!!\n\ni v damke\n\nCHIKI BRIKI\n\ncan you take the gun?\n\nYou can!\n\nI can hear that screenshot.\n\nthats nice\n\nI've never played the Stalker games but loved the Metro ones. Would I like this game? Is it good?\n\nYes you would like them, they’re similar vibes but the Metro games are linear, while STALKER games are open world. Also it’s great, but it’s pretty buggy at the moment and the visuals are taxing on lower end graphics cards.\n\nThe metro games were made by some of the original stalker devs.\n\nI'm feeling a little nostalgia about old, slightly gnarly but lovingly decorated main menus.\n\nI can't wait for this game to be playable in the next 6-18 months. It looks so cool but the bugs are also deal-breakers for me. Maybe steam winter sale of jan 2026 is reasonable?\n\nWish we had CoP one too\n\nTime to play Stalker 1, price will be down.\n\nWith all of this talk about Stalker, it makes me want to play the first game\n\nYou should have taken the picture further away\n\nSuch a nice detail! Loving the legacy 💪\n\nSo do they have the sniper rifle there is hard to see.\n\nyes.\n\nNice one\n\nIs there a CoP main menu easter egg there too? It had my fav soundtrack\n\nI love easter egg like those. If I played the first one I would be so happy seeing that.\n\nHaven't had a chance to play a ton of Stalker 2 yet, but seeing a Vector makes me giddy for some reason lol.\n\nI always think it's nice when the past of a game is incorporated into it in some way.\n\nI've never played these games but that's awesome.\n\nбля я маслину поймал\n\nstill waiting for my key to try it out, can't wait!\n\nOn a scale is 0 to 10 how much do the bugs and optimization issues affect your fun when playing the game? I've heard some people say they got completely gamebreaking bugs that forced them to old saves.\n\nFor me, it's like a 0.5 out of 10 (level of being affected).  Even encountered one game-stopping bug that I had to fix with a console command, but even then I still really like running around and exploring the Zone.  Just visited Cordon for the first time, and it's ridiculously nostalgic, like coming home again after a long while.  I remembered that starting village from countless hours in the first game...like, I literally just sat down in game and listened to NPCs tell bad jokes and play guitar while sitting around a fire, just soaked in some ambience.  What game delivers that organically??\n\n\nEdit: I have heard that late game gets pretty bad bug-wise though.  I'm approaching 30 hrs in, taking my time and still having virtually no real issues so far (other than the one).  We'll see how it goes.\n\nVery nice\n\nCan someone explain what stalker 2 is about ?\n\nThe zone burned some guy's house down and now he wants the zone to pay for it.\n\nSomewhere near the swamp area there’s an Easter  egg of the Whomping Willow from Harry Potter:\n\nBrambly tree holding up a destroyed blue car\n\nI've heard of performance issues, are they a thing on xbox? I have an xbox one s just collecting dust, might bust it out for gamepass so i can play this, but not sure if it'll be terrible or not\n\nWasn't this posted yesterday\n\nI've only put a few hours into these games over the years but I'm so nostalgic for the first game in particular. Really unique feeling games at the time.\n\nCan't wait for the patches, so I could finally play\n\nnow that's super cool\n\n🤌🏻\n\nCan't wait to try this game in like a year.\n\nIt looks pretty rough right now.\n\nOmg…this so cool 😎\n\nDamn that's awesome!\n\nThere is also the whomping willow from harry potter in the swamp. \nThere are plenty of Easter eggs.\n\nThis type of stuff is always really cool.\n\nspoiler tag...\n\nthe vector fucks in STALKER 2, I'm not this far into the game but found a full durability one and set it to semiauto and its quite an efficient weapon. Haven't even been able to upgrade it yet.\n\nSeen this on game pass is it worth downloading?\n\nThis is gonna be one of the best Easter eggs I seen.\n\nApologies for asking the dumb question... I never played the original but this game looks great. Would y'all recommend it?\n\nHello\n\nThe original menu music should be patched into this game\n\nIm not sure if it shows the age.\n\nwhat game？\n\nSandstorm by Darude\n\nThis post just reminded me I had that gun in my inventory and now it’s gone. God damn anomaly\n\nTrop stylé l’hommage au premier\n\nWhat a shame\n\nStalker 2 is such a fun franchise despite certain anomalies\n\n[removed]\n\nGood eye comrad.\n\nHomie's got a decked out gun, while i'm sitting there with my poor ass ak 47 :(\n\nThat's awesome, I'm going to check it out in the game right away\n\nIn the swamps there’s a whomping willow Easter egg with the car in the tree\n\nThis is a really sweet homage to the first game.\n\nI momentarily convinced myself a trio of pipes were a reference because the third one was missing a valve (much like the same reference in Escape From Tarkov) but I think I was just overthinking it.\n\nVery cool, I downloaded google translate for this game haha\n\nreviews seem to be all over the place ranging from 2 to 9\n\ngonna have to wait for a sale and tbh i didnt even finish first game yet\n\nHey, free sniper.\n\nSeems its time to get my xbox back from the cellar. At last something interesting might be playable on it.\n\nso cool\n\nOmg and I didn't notice it. Thanks for information!"

    "all_comment_text": "I mean, that's what I would say years before release too. Only time will tell if reality matches up\n\nCDPR also said \"The game will release when it's ready\" for Cyberpunk 2077.\n\nWell, we all know the rest... \n\nTheir word means nothing to me.\n\nThey are now an example of failed launch so it will be really amusing if they do that again. They know all eyes are on them. Their release has to be close to perfect imo\n\nThey literally did the same with Witcher 3 and everyone forgot.\n\nI played Witcher 3 at launch. It had some issues but nothing on the level of CP2077.\n\nWas Witcher a disaster at launch? I got it day of release and everything seemed fine for me (on PS4 at least). Don't recall hearing much uproar about it. Certainly not a CP2077 reaction.\n\nWitcher 1 and 2 were notoriously awful at launch. 3 had issues but they paled in comparison to 1, 2 and CP2077.\n\nwell tbf who expected W1 at the time? it's a bit irrelevant without all the hype\n\nOh, ok. I only played 3 at launch and didn't pick the other two up until a while after they came out. Wasn't aware they suffered CDP-R virus as well\n\nPS4 was the most broken at launch, iirc. I recall clipping through the floor, animation bugs, crashes galore, save corruption. Wild you experienced none of it, tbh.\n\nI played on a decent pc when it launched. The game-breaking bugs were rare (only had 2-3 crashes in the first 30 hours or so and it wasn't a big deal if you saved often as pc players often do). The crashes stopped after one of the hotfixes. I still had the usual hilarious badly performing ai and random cars falling out of the sky which wasn't a big deal either and performance was fine\n\nIt seems that it just really sucked on ps4, which was their mistake. They should have just dropped support on previous generation consoles, but corporate cd project probably wanted more money.\n\nIts nowhere half as bad with cp2077 where it was unplayable almost\n\nNo one forgot, their release track is stained.\n\nThe detail here is the fact of how CP2077 was such a huge incredible fuck up.\n\nId say it is forgotten for the most part. It only gets brought up once someone mentions CP2077's launch. In normal conversation about Witcher 3 it's almost universally talked about how loved it is. There's never casual discussion off the bat about the faulty launch.\n\nAnecdotally at least I certainly don't remember people still talking about how shit the release for the Witcher was 4 years later. It's almost like the cyberpunk launch was significantly worse and the Witcher launch gets brought up by the cdpr apologists who want to pretend the Witcher 3 release was just as bad but everyone forgot about it.\n\nTheir track record says otherwise... CDPR games have always been buggy on launch and become more stable (even playable due to some game-breaking bugs) after months of patches.\n\ncyberpunk wasn't \\*just\\* buggy on launch. For some systems it was not playable to the point of removal from the ps store; a feat I haven't seen before or since for a AAA title. I really hope people don't forget and lump cyberpunk's release with the standard \"buggy release\" because it was much, much worse than that implies.\n\nThe only other one that launched in as poor a state that I can remember was No Man's Sky. It wasn't just the game crashing, it was crashing people's consoles, causing them to lock up completely on day 1. Fortunately that was fixed fairly quickly, but it's hard to convey the sheer magnitude how utterly broken and unpolished that game was initially.\n\nTo be fair it wasn't even just that. It was the severe lack of content that was promised leading up to it's release. With CDPR games, for the most part, it's not really the content as much as it is the optimizations and overall tweaks/fixes. \n\n  \nNMS was a fraction of what was promised, but ultimately made a come back by releasing (for free) a ton of content that went even beyond what they said would be in the game.\n\nCyberpunk has a shitload of promised content that they never released.\n\nI couldn't play Witcher 3 at launch and I had above minimum spec hardware. Like, I loaded in, had a half a minute of 5fps gameplay and then the game crashed. Meanwhile I finished CP2077 3 days after launch on a 1060.\n\n\nWitcher 3 was a far worse release for me personally than CP2077 (though I also appeared lucky with CP2077, basically outside of a few visual glitches and some minor bugs I had no problems).\n\nDon’t forget the part where they were intentionally super deceptive about allowing reviews for those consoles. People in this post are acting like cdpr was upfront about this and clear that it was gonna take some patching, but it was very much the opposite. Also ridiculous that people are blaming the fans for it releasing too early like it wasn’t super clearly just so they could make the Christmas season.\n\nNot just in the context of reviews, they straight up spewed bullshit about how they were so impressed at how great it ran on OG model X1/PS4 consoles just a few weeks before launch.\n\n\"CDPR games have always been buggy on launch and become more stable (even playable due to some game-breaking bugs) after months of patches.\"\n\nYes and no. Witcher 3 was a bit buggy at launch, but overall not as much as your average Bethesda game. Cyberpunk 2077 on the other hand was unacceptably broken. There is a difference between the two.\n\nComparing it to Bethesda is not a very high bar\n\nThey are a publicly traded company. They have to say this so they make the investors happy. It's not a real statement from them.\n\nYup still not buying anything from them at launch.\n\nWill see after release\n\nSee everyone in 2030 for the initial teaser. 2035 release.\n\n2038 to be finished.\n\n2040 for the DLC\n\n2050 for PC\n\n2077 for DLC\n\ncan't wait, choom.\n\nGonna be so preem\n\nAnd still be out before Star Citizen finishes\n\nStraight up though, if a bunch of dipshits paid me $10-100 million per year to work on a game, I'd work on that game as long as I possibly could.\n\nKojima, is that you?\n\nSC will be published after the creator dies.\n\nAnd gonna cost a bunch of eddies\n\nOnly gonks pay their precious eddies for a game\n\nYou want to try the demo from this Militech shard I customized?\n\nby then there will be all these stupid articles about \"what cyberpunk got right/wrong\"\n\nWe’ve finally come full circle\n\nIt’s cdprojekt red, not rockstar. Witcher 3 and cyberpunk were released on pc same time as consoles and take advantage of pc hardware.\n\nCyberpunk ran best on PC at launch, too.\n\nI hope there will be a PC2 to run this.\n\nI've started pushing GPU parts up my nose so I can integrate with PC2 faster.\n\n‘PC Pro’\n\n2060 for release on Nintendo Switch 5\n\nDont forget the anime from 2039\n\nFinished with a bunch of the features they showed off in 2030 missing.\n\nWitcher 2077\n\nExclusively on the PlayStation 25\n\nStand not included*\n\n7 years between cyberpunk teaser and release, so funny\n\nTbh I think that's why the launch was so broken.  Passion project that got dragged out and the publisher was bleeding money and basically said \"that's enough release it or lose funding\".\n\nA story as old as time. Games taking too long, being rushed, still taking forever, releasing too early.\n\nI wonder what the industry would be like if devs weren't forced into shitty work life balance.\n\nI mean I'm on the production company's side on this one.  7 year development cycle is obscene.\n\nStar Citizen: rookies.\n\nCyberpunk development didn't start in earnest until Witcher 3 DLC was finished, so it was more like a 4 year cycle until release.\n\nI have no idea why it's so long for these giant AAA companies. What is even happening behind the scenes?\n\nYou could say graphics, mechanical aspects.. But the tools to make that stuff is also pretty advanced now too.\n\nThey made their own engine. That's the bulk of \"advanced tools\". They made the ones they used to make the game. Things aren't as simple as (for instance) \"Blender is already a fully-featured 3d modeling software, so the artists just need to work there and press the export button once they're done, and it just magically works in the game\". The tooling pipelines (with its corresponding engine functionality) that take your raw assets and ultimately make something \"just work\" in-game are incredible complex, and you essentially need dozens (if not hundreds) of them for all the radically different types of assets that go in a game.\n\nAnd that's just one part of development... there's dozens of other parts, from coming up with the concept and turning it into concrete features and assets to make, iterating on the gameplay until it's actually fun, game balance, optimization, QA, localization... all in a complex web of conditions (e.g. can't balance or optimize what isn't implemented yet) and often fixing a thing in one of them resulting in something breaking elsewhere (e.g. after tweaking the game balance, we realized the combat was boring so we changed something to tackle the issue... that introduced a new bug that had to be found after that was done, in QA... the bug fixes introduced a performance regression that required further optimization work to be done... you get the idea)\n\nAnd I haven't even got into the fact that AAA games are made by many hundreds of people. If you've ever organized an event for a few of your friends, you know what a nightmare it can be to get people to coordinate, even when it's just a handful of them. Imagine that but it's literal hundreds, each with their own lives at work and outside of it, with tasks that may block other people's tasks in unpredictable ways, each taking a hard to predict amount of time, and how are you going to make sure everybody is on the same page in terms of exactly what game you're making? It's a nightmare.\n\nIf you couldn't tell, yes, I'm a game dev for a living myself. Frankly, it's no small miracle any of these humongous games ever gets released at all. You can say \"so don't make games that are that big then\", which is fine. Indies are doing that and it produces plenty of masterpieces. But what isn't really reasonable is to expect AAA quality to be delivered in a couple years just because \"surely that should be enough if people aren't wasting time\", says random impatient gamer with absolutely no idea how games are actually made. Frankly, even as a fellow dev, I don't think I'd ever feel comfortable telling a dev they're taking too long. I mean, maybe if it gets to Duke Nukem Forever levels. But really, don't be like Elon Musk and assume you know people's line of work better than them (to be clear, I'm not saying *you* did, this is just general advice), it just makes you look foolish *and* condescending, never a good combo. If something took a long time, chances are there is a reasonable reason for it.\n\nI think of of the biggest issues now is that things are teased years before they're even started just to drum up hype. Which I understand, but it builds unrealistic expectations too.like the Cyberpunk trailer in 2013. It was awesome to see, and then we waited 7 years and got what we got.\n\nReminder than TESVI was first teased over 6 years ago\n\nThey're just as bad. Especially considering Skyrim has been out for THIRTEEN YEARS.\n\nIndeed. There may be valid reasons for a game to take years to complete but there isn’t any reason to make the public wait for that long.\n\nIn terms of Cyberpunk 2077 I have a conspiracy theory - at a certain, advanced point of development somehow a possibility of hiring Keanu came up and as a result a whole thing had to be overhauled to fit his character in.\n\nMost people never followed the dev cycle, but it didn't take 7 years between 2013 and 2020 to make Cyberpunk. Cyberpunk actually only got 4.5 years of development, wherein production work really began after Witcher 3's last expansion came out, which was sometime in 2016.\n\nI'm not defending CDPR for anything, I wasn't happy to play a broken game on launch either, but if we're going to criticize them, we should criticize them with facts, not assumptions.\n\nIt was a 4 year development cycle. That's pretty normal.\n\nThey built a new engine however, which heavily added the time for release. Now that the engine is built by someone else and proven to work very well they can focus on just making the game content.\n\nAlso they stated they want teams to work in parallel, which means they plan to work much faster given the tech isn't propriety. The range of developers on tap is higher than just their internal team by going with a more worldwide known 3D engine. They can hire other companies to do parts of the game instead of all being in-house. Speed and efficiency is why they changed their engine from what I can tell reading between the lines.\n\nI loved the final versions of Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk and I can't wait for Witcher 4 in I'm guessing the next 3 years of development.\n\nNice, so we will get The Elder Scrolls 6 and Witcher 4 in the same year!\n\nIn the year 2525, if man is still alive\n\nBold of them to compete with TES6 dropping same year\n\nReddit : stop releasing broken games please !!!\n\nAlso Reddit : not like this !!!\n\nI mean I'd be worried if they said its going to be \"inferior, smaller, worse\"\n\nLmao\n\n“The next Witcher will be inferior to Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk for sure,” the Witcher game director admitted. “We’re just really worn out from Cyberpunk. We’re aiming for a decent game - a 75 or so on Metacritic feels realistic.”\n\nit really  wouldnt have been that weird for them to have said 'this witcher game will be smaller in scope than w3 and cyberpunk\" and that also would've been fine. so them saying it'll be bigger and greater is genuine news.\n\nIt is not going to be bigger in size than Witcher 3 for sure. They said before Cyberpunk that Witcher 3 size was too much and most players didn't even finish the game. This quote is a generic thing that an engineer said in an interview months back. If the game is slightly longer than Blood and Wine I will be happy.\n\nId actually love a bigger world with less filler content in it. scaling mountains or venturing deep into dark forests where the journey is a real act in of itself. But Id rather not have a pack of random enemy + 1 inconsequential chest every 20m.\n\nYea, I dont think that bigger is a good idea. Witcher 3 is one of the last games i think the World wasn't too big. I don't think I saw everything, i played 100h and i think I saw 75% of it.\n\nI want a Witcher 3 like game with a strong Theme but more polished. The map can be smaller for all i care.\n\nHeck, make those kind of games more often but with half the map. Witcher 3 is a game i play one a year tops.\n\nThe correct phasing is \"The Witcher 4 will be more focused as it explores blah blah blah.\"\n\n*Don’t you worry about blank. Let me worry about blank*\n\n[deleted]\n\nOne of the reasons I loved the last three Tomb Raider games is precisely that they struck a great balance between world size, story, graphics, and playability/fun. The pacing of those games is damned near perfect imho.\n\nI loved Witcher 3, but I know lots of people who found the pacing poor—especially the opening—to the point of never getting into the fun part of the game. Hopefully they improve on that, not just the engine.\n\nThis is the reason I don't like Zelda BOTW or TOTK, they're just *too big* and open compared to most older Zelda games.\n\nThat's my main dislike of the modern day Pokemon games. I wish they would drop the open world, and go back to the old routes and towns system.\n\nThey did it so poorly because it's \"open world,\" but there's still more or less a linear path you have to follow. The new game starts in a central location, and they're like, \"You can go anywhere to do these 12 things!\" But then you go to the wrong one first, and they have pokemon 30 levels higher than yours. At that point, just make it a linearly progressed game since I now have to look up the correct route to take without getting dumpstered. I thought Arceus was very well done, and I loved S&amp;S, but S&amp;V fell flat to the point I didn't even finish the game.\n\nIf you’re going to do massive open world, you’ve definitely got to invest something in the quest lines that makes it more than just a grinding/fetching simulator. Witcher 3 was groundbreaking at the time, if you made it out of the opening act, at least if you like story-driven games and side-quests that at least sometimes play a role in the main game itself. It was a worthy successor to Skyrim in that sense, but both suffered from the same ultimate problem at the bottom: you can’t go that big without losing something else important in terms of the overall game itself.\n\nAssassin’s Creed has been rightly criticized for going even further down the half-assed storyline/fetch-quest simulator route for the sake of turning what was an impressive historical/location simulator with solid stealth gameplay into an open world version of only the former.\n\nThe Witcher 3's open world was nothing revolutionary. It basically suffered from the same ailments that Skyrim/Fallout/Assassins Creed suffer from. What was different is, that the writing was way better. Witcher 3 handles side quests in the context of the \"urgency\" of the main quest way better. Take Fallout 4: you watch your Husband/Wive get brutally murdered and your son is kidnapped. Now you are looking for justice and your son in a hurry. Do you really think the protagonist would care about gathering paint cans? Side quests in Witcher 3 influence the main quest and the other way around. The main story gives you breathing room, where side quests make sense.\n\nI agree. I actually generally prefer games that are more linear and on the rails but that are packed with content and optional quests that are interesting. I think The Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk 2077 struck a good balance of that but The Witcher 3 had just a little too much “off the beaten path” stuff for relatively little reward. A slightly more compact and succinct experience would be my preference but I’m only one person.\n\nWitcher sidequests were amazing and for me there couldnt be enough, but all the boring loot at hidden spots was dumb. Surely they know this and will improve. If they make it same scale, I’ll be happy.\n\nYeah the map could even have been like half the size honestly, flesh out a couple of the towns with more unique Witcher quests. Way too many “?” spots with useless junk\n\nThe third map was terrible with all the sunken chests. I certainly clocked out there.\n\nPTSD of 104 sirens getting laser guided GPS co-ordinates to my exact location every time I try to dive down for treasure.\n\nAgreed. I was also way less invested in Skellige\n\nI really liked the land part of Skellige but fuck anything to do with boats. I wish I could pay a couple vikings to take me out there and dive for the treasure, they can each have their fair share before I kill them and dump their bodies in the ocean.\n\nI vividly remember absentmindedly collecting those chests for 3 hours lol\n\n\"prefer games that are more linear and on the rails\"\n\nyep i agree completely, life is too short to play an open world game where 90% of the fucking game is getting from point A to point B\n\nwhen i was a kid i LOVED open world games because \"WOW i can explore, im totally free!\" but the novelty of that wears off quick, and now as an adult i realize my time is more valuable.\n\ngive me some forks in the road that i can choose to explore or not and then traverse back to the main path, thats as much exploration as i want.\n\nUncharted is one of my favorite game series of all time and is pretty much on rails from start to finish. \n\nAdmittedly, this is more of a personal problem for me. Take Cyberpunk. Technically, you could stick exclusively to the main plot story missions and finish the game faster than any Uncharted game. But I have some sort of autistic itch that gets scratched when I see “Mission Complete” that compels me to clear every single area of a map before moving on and eventually it just becomes overwhelming.\n\nYup, linear became like a bad word in gaming, but linear helps you create such a great storyline and narrative. there's something a bit shitty about finding the most epic sword, but it's 10 levels too high for you, then you go get some witcher upgrades that make that great sword actually be shit before you even hit hte level cap for it. LImiting what zones you can move in with higher danger lets you gain better items at around the 'right time'.\n\nthough witcher 3 had huge issues with most loot being worthless due to ridiculously easy to get witcher sets being wayyyy too powerful.\n\nBigger means nothing to me. Better is everything and hitting buzzwords in gaming that started like 15 years ago and don't actually automatically make games better is worrying. \n\nLike starfield is 'huge'.... and absolutely god fucking awful.\n\nHogwarts Legacy could have been just Hogwarts and Hogsmead and nobody would have complained that their open world was mostly empty, because Hogwarts was densely packed with detail.\n\nI was enthralled by Hogwarts Legacy, up until the world started opening up beyond Hogwarts, and Hogsmead. The open world was boring, bland, and repetitive. It also killed any sense of immersion. I, a child and brand new student, was flying around the world for days at a time fighting evil wizards, bandits, and monsters that were terrorizing towns full of full-fledged wizards, presumably skipping all of my classes, to the concern of absolutely no one.\n\nI wish the game had narrows its focus and had a better system for classes.\n\nYeah, I wish it was a bit more like Bully.\n\nYeah a mix of that and something like Persona would be ridiculous. Full school year, every day with focus on classes and slice of life.\n\nThere really needed to be some kind of morality system, you could go around using unforgivable curses like no tomorrow and no one cared.\n\nIt did. Got bored of it after 20 hours. Very repetitive.\n\nI've beaten the first act like 3 times now but always stop after that, just get burnt out\n\n[deleted]\n\nThe tales of Yuna and Yuriko are particularly hard hitting emotional sidequests and the philosophical differences between Jin and his uncle are a very big driving point. \n\nIndeed, act 2 is where things get going. And by the time you’re in act 3 it’s just pure awesome.\n\nThat's the problem with the game design though. You shouldn't need to rely on telling people \"just slog through the first 25/30 hours\" and then it gets great. You need to hook people earlier.\n\nHonestly, Cyberpunk sort of has a similar issue with the massive cutscene and lore dump segment right after the conclusion to the prologue heist. My first playthrough had me really excited as I was finally getting into the controls and then boom like 45 minutes of basically zero gameplay.\n\nYeah it's like when people say \"this 800 page book is a slog but it's totally worth it for the ending.\" I'll just look it up on wikipedia and read a book that is actually enjoyable start to finish, life is too short to invest 20 hours into something you don't enjoy in case it maybe pays off.\n\nThey needed to pace the progression better, in my opinion. If there were still notable skills or abilities to unlock in the third act, it would have kept me interested. \n\nCyberpunk was intentionally smaller/shorter than Witcher 3 because their internal numbers showed a lot of people didn’t finish W3. To those people, I say what the hell is wrong with you?!\n\nIts probably my most played game and I've never finished it. There is a lot to do and it's a really long game, usually something else comes up that I want to play or do.\n\nthis happens to me with giant open world games. I play for dozens of hours, life happens and I have to take a break but then it’s to daunting to jump back into. That being said I can usually say I got my moneys worth if I played a game for 50 hours.\n\nSame. I explored the entire world of BoTW, got like 90 shrines, did all divine beasts then burnt out before fighting Ganon. I tried a couple of times but I was never able to jump back in and do Ganon's castle.\n\nI played it 3 times but only one time did I manage to play till the end. That too on the 3rd attempt.\n\nW3 world was too big for its own good\n\nI mean, I finished it but the map did not need to have that many question marks. I refuse to believe there was a single person who enjoyed collecting the treasure chests in Skellige waters.\n\nI beat witcher 3 twice, but I've attempted to play through it again about 5 times. The question marks bother me tremendously. I can't just ignore them. So I try to power through all of them and then play the story at my own pace. \n\n\nOnce I hit Skellige, I just burn out and stop playing. The treasure spots are almost always crap anyway. It sucks because it legitimately stop me from replaying an otherwise phenominal game. I love everything else about it. There has to be a mod or something\n\nthe most thing i hated about those spots was level scaling reweards\n\na chest defended by level 30 bandits at level 22? some level 17 gear and crafting materials for gear of that level too\n\na chest defended by level 4 ghouls at level 40? some level 39 gear and master quality crafting ingredients\n\nhell, in general i hated the level scaling, it made visiting those spots quite pointless and boring\n\nI love W3 as much as the next fanboy, but Skellige is most likely the reason why a lot of people felt turned off by the world.\n\nWould even say like 1/4 of Velen played a part\n\nI do think Cyberpunk's world is about the perfect size, it helps that the immersion aspects makes it really enjoyable to drive around\n\n&gt;To those people, I say what the hell is wrong with you?!\n\nHundreds of games to play and not enough time. My pile of shame gets higher every year - still haven't finished Cyberpunk, Shadow of the Erdtree, Satisfactory, Fallout New Vegas and many others.\n\n[deleted]\n\nLoad times for the Witcher 3 on base model PS4 were crazy long.  The next gen upgrade came out for ps5 and I finished the game and both dlcs in a few weeks because the play experience was so much better and faster.\n\nWhen I first played Witcher 3 I saw how vast the world was and legitimately put it down for like a year because it was kind of intimidating. \n\nI eventually beat the game twice, but can totally see other people having a similar experience and life getting in the way or whatever\n\nIt is repetitive and boring after some point. You either suffer through slog or just focus on story only.\n\nNGL, I did EVERY quest on the first continent, got to Skellige, and just didn't have the energy to go on. A year later by the time I did have more energy for it, coincidentally, my GPU up and fried itself the next time I turned on Witcher 3, lol. I loved it, would recommend it to anyone 10x over, but I dunno, it took a lot out of me to try to play that game after work.\n\nYeah but also lot of the time a gane dev says it's gonna be bigger and better it just ends up being mid, with a big but empty and boring world.\n\nYeah but if they say it's going to be mid then you know it's going to be even worse than that. When a game dev tries to pull down expectations, you know it's going to be a rough launch.\n\nYea, not as catchy.\n\nBut they could have said 'scaled back' so they can deliver a more solid release.\n\n**Full Quotes:**   \n  \n\"Again, I will not say it's easy,\" he added, \"but I think that we have some cool stuff going, and hopefully that will have some good showcase \\[of the technology\\]. The only thing I will say is that changing the tech for us does not change the fact that we always will be ambitious,\" he said. \"And the next game we do will not be smaller, and it will not be worse. So it will be better, bigger, greater than [The Witcher 3](https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt), than Cyberpunk - because for us, it's unacceptable \\[to launch that way\\]. We don't want to go back.\n\nOne of the few other tidbits of already-public information is that CD Projekt Red has moved away from its own bespoke, internal REDengine to the more widely-adopted Unreal, which is owned by Epic Games. - \"The first thing I want to say again, to be sure, 100 percent clear, is that the whole team, myself included, are extremely proud of the engine we built for Cyberpunk. So it is not about, 'This is so bad that we need to switch' and, you know, 'Kill me now' - that is not true. That is not true, and this is not why the decision was made to switch.\"   \n  \n\"The way we built stuff in the past was very one-sided, like one project at a time. We pushed the limit - but also we saw that if we wanted to have a multi-project at the same time, building in parallel, sharing technology together, it is not easy. So the idea was that we can push the technology, we can finally have all the technical people in the company working together on different projects, rather than super centralised into one technology that can very difficultly be shared between other projects.\"\n\nFor those who might not know:\n\n&gt;\\[to launch that way\\]\n\nis a writer's or editor's note and not a verbatim quote. For all any of us truly know, the true meaning of what was said could very well not have been about game launches. Could have simply meant they don't want to return to the old way of doing things.\n\nThe writer's notes on this article add too much imo.  I feel like if they had a more extensive interview to back them up they should've included that rather than inserting themselves into other quotes.  Or just paraphrased the whole thing.\n\nFor me the headline read like they didn’t want to launch a broken game again, but the article sounded more like they wanted to move forward and keep releasing bigger and better\n\nWe’ll just have to wait and see I guess, I won’t play anything from them until at least 3 years after release on discount so idc\n\nUsually those are used to make context clear or clean up wording of a quote, though. You almost make it sound like writers and editors use them to just make stuff up or twist the meaning.\n\nCorrect usage is for readability or space. If the actual quote wasn't about game launches, then that's pretty bad usage.\n\nMore likely (hopefully) his phrasing was just long or unclear. Like \"it's unacceptable for us to have made a launch in a way that was rushed and with a product we couldn't stand behind\".\n\nSo they don’t even mention making Witcher 4? They just say their next game will be bigger and better than Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk\n\nbut for the execs, as always, it won't fucking matter.\n\n**\"Game developer says their next game will be good\"**\n\n**\"Athlete says he will play well next season\"**\n\n**\"Chef says his food will taste good\"**\n\nHow the fuck is this news?\n\nWhy would they over promise when what happened to cyberpunk\n\nBecause by the time Cyberpunk launched, people had forgotten all about W3's launch. \n\nGamers have goldfish brains and are incredibly susceptible to marketing.\n\nThis is what drives me nuts. People just forgot all about Witcher 3 being jank as fuck at launch. I was working at Game Stop at the time, and I remember *many* people complaining to me about how broken it was. As if I could do anything about it.\n\nThat's not to excuse Cyberpunk's launch. It was very bad. But like Witcher 3, it was supported properly and come out the other side as a very good, engaging game. That's where CDPR succeeds and studios like Bethesda fail.\n\nI don’t think that hits the nail on the head between CDPR and Bethesda. \n\nThe issue the more recent Bethesda games have had is that they don’t have the sense of a “world” that W3 and Cyberpunk have. As flawed as those games are, and despite how rough the launches were, they stand out in feeling like places where people actually live. Starfield doesn’t feel like that for the most part; it just feels like a setting for a video game.\n\nSkyrim, for all its faults and jank, had thar crucial element of feeling like a world. If not so much in the characters you interacted with, then in the history the world told to you as you explored, both on large and small scale. And it’s a part of why that game was so successful and people still love it. But since then, with F4, F76, and Starfield, they just don’t feel like that same time and energy was put into portray the worlds they’re apart of; they’re just a collection of neat ideas that cobbled together to see if they stick.\n\nGamers are bottom of the barrel people man. Literally say one thing. Do another.\n\n“And remember: this time *really* no pre-orders!”\n\nIts almost like opinions on reddit, or any individual forum, are not representative of all people who play video games\n\nShoutout to everyone who still insists Cyberpunk launched in a great state\n\nThis is sorta clickbait. This article is based on another article by Eurogamer. The Eurogamer article is based on interview earlier this year talking about the company in general. He only said future games won't be smaller or worse and that they will be better and bigger and won't want to repeat Cyberpunk mistakes. Obviously, he will say that - who will say their next product will be worse than past ones? This is made into much bigger than the actual quote. Guys, please don't fall into made-up media hype.\n\nSo don't and don't overhype it.\n\nAnd for the love of god don't fucking prebook.\n\nAnd fucking playtest it my GOD. Witcher 3 was a flaming mess on release, too.\n\nLet's just start with the same mistakes and promises again, shall we?\n\n[removed]\n\nKinda funny how even though the devs here are literally saying that the CP77 was unacceptable, I'll still have people in r/gaming threads tell me how launch wasn't \"that bad\"\n\n[deleted]\n\nSome people just didn't experience that many issues or those didn't impact them. My partner played the whole game the first weeks (or a month?) after launch with only 1 crash - still not great but she literally did everything in the game and that was her only issue.\n\nI guess sometimes it is luck.\n\nThey'll talk shit about people who buy CoD or Madden year after year but will put down pre-orders and gobble up  broken games as well, just from their list of approved companies.\n\nThe Netflix anime series really worked for this kind of minded people.\n\nI'll believe it when I see it\n\nI don't want it to be \"Better, Bigger, Greater\" than Witcher 3 or C77. What I want is for it to simply be a good game that plays well, runs well, and has plenty of unique content. Basically make it a game that isn't designed for the company's marketing team and instead is designed for gamers to enjoy.\n\nBetter and Greater is good. \"Bigger\" is a red flag if meant literally, and also a different kind of red flag if meant as meaningless hype.\n\n“We leave greed to others” \n\n*CDPR devs perk up* \"U wot mate?\"\n\n\"coming when it's ready\"\n\nWitcher 3 and cp2077 both had good map sizes.. excessively large maps are a pain in the ass most of the time..\n\nIt’s gonna be a garbage launch calling it\n\nHow does the reminder me in 6 years work? Haha\n\n!remindme 6 years\n\nit's going to launch with 25% of the features and mechanics that it was supposed to have.  \nafter two years it will go up to 35, maybe 40%.  \npeople will applaud it as an amazing comeback story and say \"what does it matter what it was supposed to be ? I love it!\"     \nrinse and repeat.\n\nCyberpunk used those same words and thats what fucked them.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIf anyone wants a lesson on what scope creep is, look no further than CP2077.  It reeked of half baked features, systems not fully fleshed out and features displayed in reels, but never made it to the release.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nA lot of thier credibility was lost.  I'll believe it when I see it.\n\nDont forget the fake trailers that the devs admitted to.\n\nRemember no preorders\n\nTell everyone to never preorder\n\nTold my aunt at Thanksgiving and she gave me a funny look\n\nCDPR has a demonstrated history of *getting* their games working, but let’s not pretend this started with Cyberpunk. The Witcher III was nearly unplayable at launch as well.\n\nI played W3 no issues at launch on PC, was it limited to the consoles?\n\nBetter, bigger, greater, faster, stronger.\n\nThey've got to stop using Daft Punk as their spokesperson.\n\n(It will launch like Cyberpunk)\n\nI'll be honest I want a new cyberpunk more then the Witcher 4\n\nYou would have thought they'd have learned to stop saying stuff like this\n\nWhy does it need to be bigger? This obsession with quantity over quality, probably to appease shareholders more than anything.\n\nblah blah reads like \"We leave greed to others\" shtick I'll believe it when I see it.\n\nIt's easy to talk\n\nToo bad big game companies still are in a model where they need to finalize their release dates long before their game is finished.  That's really the core problem innit.\n\nAnyone who trusts CDPR after cyberpunk is a fucking moron\n\nAlso fuck No Man's Sky too\n\nI mean... Witcher 3 was pretty rough out the gate too. They didn't have the console issues, but there were a lot of bugs to work out.\n\nAnd with it being built on UE5, it'll have more stutters than ever too!\n\nGames these days. With 5-15 year development cycles, you can keep count on one hand how many games of your favorite franchise get released before you die.\n\nThose adjectives are how you start setting unrealistic expectations\n\nSee you in 15 years then folks\n\n“What can I say to make you preorder again.  Whatever you’re imagining, I said that.”\n\nIt's gonna be on Unreal 5. And it's a CDPR game. It's gonna be a complete disaster on launch.\n\nId be sixty before i can get to play that\n\n# \"For us, it's unacceptable to launch (like Cyberpunk). We don't want to go back.\"\n\nJudge a person by their actions, not their words.\n\nI'll believe it when I see it.\n\nI really hope we don’t play as Ciri, as some people are theorizing and hoping for. I want a break from the characters of the original series with a new protagonist.\n\nIt doesn't need to be bigger. Witcher 3 was more than enough content. Games really don't need to be bigger, just make them better.\n\nI don’t want bigger. Witcher 3 is already too big. So much fucking filler. Give me something more compact but more interesting.\n\n&gt;It's unacceptable to launch (like Cyberpunk). \n\nYeah well you should've had that mindset with Cyberpunk 2077."

If dosent work after that repeat.\n\nOHHHHHH BANANA\n\nI borrowed a copy from a friend and it would fail to load \"The Arbiter\" level, so I could effectively only play up to Metropolis.\n\nTook toothpaste and a brush with me, had at it for 30 minutes and lo and behold, I could finally play as the arbiter! Could play until Delta Halo and then it just failed again haha, good memories playing split screen with my brother.\n\nDon't forget to spread peanut butter on  a charcoal briquette and put it in the microwave to make diamonds\n\n[deleted]\n\nNo idea, but there's evidence for the latter- when I was a kid, it was blowing into the slots of NES cartridges, which *did* work, if only because it dislodged dust.  \n\nThing is, if you ask anyone where they found out about that, they'll tell you they don't know.  Nobody told us, we just... knew.  There was some kind of cartridge-induced mind meld going on.\n\nAn entire tube\n\nNothing a bit of carpet shampoo can't fix\n\nWhich power baby are you?\n\nThat rug really ties the room together.\n\nIt just really ties the room together, man\n\nNot now donny!\n\nAnyone mind if I do a J?\n\nMe when I catch someone screenwatching, \"Am I the only one around here who gives a shit about the rules?\"\n\nWhat the fuck anything has to do with Vietnam?\n\nOk, that is nice lol. Disc based rugs.... now there's an idea.\n\nIf it had the disc hole, it could be a poncho!\n\nIt could be a halo, too.\n\nCould be print on an umbrella.\n\nI wish OP read this and made it a poncho!!\n\nOh hell no 😭😭\n\nI've been seeing Instagram ads for these for quite some time now, first time I've actually seen someone get one\n\nW fucking carpet, w friend\n\n&gt;W fucking carpet\n\nI don't recommend it unless you like rug burn.\n\nAll gas, no brakes\n\nPlot twist, his buddy is making sure that he gets all the girls that they know.\n\nActually that's an O carpet but nice attempt!\n\nMarry that friend\n\nShe plays for a different team unfortunately. 🤷‍♂️\n\nHow unfortunate. 🫡\n\nYou're now designated wingman, you've gotta work with her to pretend to approach her during dates thanking her profusely for the really amazing rug, of course it would be much more believable if you brought the rug with you, you know the old \"oh man I can't believe I ran into you while taking that amazing rug you gave me to the bar/theater/restaurant/secluded spot in the woods where I'm totally not burying the motherfucker who tried stealing my new halo 2 rug\".\n\nI can't not think about how scuffed the bottom of that disc is. Bad disc care. I'd almost rather that carpet have the disc art face down.\n\nOne of the worst fights I ever had with my brother was over his habit of leaving discs out like this. Ended up having to get my copy of Battlefront 2 resurfaced.\n\nHoly shit, just put the discs back in their cases! - me, with like 40 CDs piled haphazardly in my car's center console, no cases anywhere in sight\n\nThe worst part is that we didn't even have that many games, and he probably only consistently played, like, 5. Apparently that was still too many to handle.\n\nWe didn't know anything back then, but your brother might have been right to leave them artwork side up after all, a scratch to the artwork side can be fatal since it doesn't take much to reach the aluminum layer where the data is stored. It's toast when you hold the disc up to a light source and can see through the scratch. The bottom side can actually take a bit of abuse and still keep on chugging, at least for CDs and DVDs. On Blu-ray discs you gotta be more careful 'cause the data is packed much more tightly so the laser has a harder time compensating for scratches. The discs themselves use more scratch resistant material, but the double-edged sword is they can't be resurfaced. A CD or DVD can take a resurface job multiple times if you are lucky.\n\nMostly the issue was him leaving them out at all, considering we kept all the cases about 2 feet away.\n\nMy best friend puts his discs back in cases!  Whatever case he has lying around.  Doesn't matter if it's the right case or not.  It's been coming back to bite him for twenty years.  He still won't stop.\n\nYou had me at the start! Lol At least your friend is trying. Weirdly enough, I'm only a dipshit with my music discs. Games and other media go in the cases *to which they belong.* Even my Switch carts go in their respective cases, and those carts seem like you'd have to try to ruin em. But that's also because they're approximately the size of my fucking thumbnail. Fun fact: I moved once, lost my BoTW cart for almost a year, moved *again,* found Zelda. Haha Straight from case to console and back; I never even set them down anymore.\n\nYeah, those things are so small that I would ABSOLUTELY lose them immediately.  Case, console, case.  Nothing in between.\n\nThe amount of caseless games I see at used game stores never ceases to amaze me. We solved this problem in the '90s with the Genesis! Games have cases! USE THEM\n\nOmg I love it\n\ncut the middle out\n\nP O N C H O\n\nWhat is this? A disk for giants?\n\nFirst we had the Gamecube with the Minidisk, now were going to get the Switch 2 with the Megadisks.\n\nwe call that... laser disc\n\n where did they get it\n\nI asked my wife if I could get one for the living room… she said fk no\n\nAsk her why she doesn’t want you to save the galaxy?\n\nIt’s not my birthday :(\n\nYou have permission to write **fuck**\n\nHe can't buy the carpet he wants and you think he will have permission to blaspheme.\n\nImmediate divorce\n\nReddit always jumps to this conclusion, but for once it genuinely seems justified.\n\nMeanwhile, my husband keeps talking me out of spending a fiscally irresponsible amount of money on these because I want like five of them and can't decide. 😂\n\n[removed]\n\nI thought it was a real disc and then I read the title lol\n\nI was trying to figure out why Halo 2 was being called a carpet.  The graphics were a bit wonky at times...like a carpet?  He doesn't like the game and is going to step on it?  I kept seeing the feet as fingers holding the disk up for the camera.\n\nYeah, I read the title and then was wondering why the Halo 2 disc he was holding above the carpet looked warped at the top.\n\nSo sad growing up this game and Franchise were the pinnacle of gaming, now it’s associated with a shitty tv show and mid games\n\nHalo 2 changed the direction of my gaming life.\n\nIt’s the first multiplayer game that I REALLY got into as a kid\n\nI was deep into racing games on Playstation at the time, Gran Turismo, Midnight Club, NFS, etc. Hadn’t played Halo 1. Went to a party at a buddies house and they were playing Halo 2 on Xbox Live. I bought an Xbox the next day. Turned me into a FPS fan. Obviously my username is a play on the Banished from Halo Infinite and Halo Wars 2.\n\nFucking awesome!! Now you gotta get the map pack disc 😛\n\nOh my godddd now I need that too\n\nYour friend is a good friend, that carpet is very cool.\n\nMy wife, although usually very reasonable, would never let me have this. This would be my leg lamp from Christmas story lol.\n\nDO NOT MAKE ILLEGAL COPIES OF THIS CARPET\n\nThat’s just the best\n\nThat's a sick idea.\n\nI need one! This will be my tree skirt for my Christmas tree this year!\n\nIf it gets damaged, you can just fill in the gaps with toothpaste and brush it in with a cloth!\n\nautomatic cable sugar physical beneficial crowd tease sleep repeat plants\n\nLooks very cool, took me a couple secs to realize it was carpet\n\nLiterally a physical copy\n\nIf you look in the small white print it says for 10 and under...\n\nWhat a good time.  Those were the days.\n\nI’ll put it right next to my MechAssault one\n\nI hear eight year old cursing me out on Xbox Live after seeing this carpet.\n\n[Ultimate Friendship](https://cdn.imgchest.com/files/l4nec3wn8n4.gif)\n\n:O \n\nI want one...\n\nSick fuckin carpet bro. That's a real friend for sure.\n\nThat's fucking gorgeous.\n\nI keep seeing these ads and I'm like, Meh... But now thinking about it, I need the halo trilogy now!\n\nTIL a carpet makes noise. Anyone else hear that?\n\nIf I got one like this I know darn well I would trip and either injury myself greatly or die. Then my parents would finally have a substantial point of \"gaming destroyed my life\" lol. TAPE THAT BAD BOY DOWN AND LIFT YOUR FEET PLEASE!\n\nMaster Chief, you mind telling me what you're doing on that rug? \n\nSir, tying this room together  \\*music intensifies\n\nYou DARE! trample upon PERFECTION!?!?!?\n\nThey left the “do not make illegal copies of this disc” 🧑‍🍳💋\n\nI believe that's called a rug...but dope none the less\n\nFire\n\nIt's upside down, you're gonna scratch the disc.\n\nthat isnt a carpet. its a rug\n\nYeah, I was wondering that. A carpet covers the entire floor and is fixed into the room. I wonder if it's a language thing, as a lot of people seem to be going with 'carpet' rather than 'rug'. \n\nNot that it matters really, but it did confuse my silly little British brain for a moment.\n\nyeah im just being petty=P\n\n&gt; I wonder if it's a language thing\n\nNo, it's just people using it incorrectly.\n\nDamn that's cool\n\nVery cool\n\nIf I were given a rug like this, I would ask my granny to knit me a DVD drive of this size.\n\nHalo 2 is the only game I went to a midnight release for. No ragerts.\n\nCan I get this with the Everquest CD?\n\nOne of the greatest of all time. I still have a sealed special edition copy with the metal case that has the orange do not open until November 9,  2004 sticker.\n\nLiterally unplayable\n\nDu-du-DUUUH\nDu-du-DUUUH\nDu-du-DUUUH\nDu-du-du DUH DUH DAH!!\n\nSometime I wish i was born earlier just to experiance the hype first-hand.\n\n[removed]\n\nSuper jelly\n\n[removed]\n\nOmg I'm so proud of you) I remember that I was playing in the game.\n\nA very classic game, and I want\n\nI was wondering what a carpet had to do with a person holding a copy of halo 2 then I had to look again...\n\nReally cool carpet\n\nW\n\nI would be scared to carry food or drinks over that\n\nAmazing 🤩\n\nMaster Chief, you mind telling me what you're doing on that carpet?\n\nThat is SO cool!\n\nI didn’t go out that entire summer to play on Xbox live\n\nDamn you put your cds faced down? \"You don't care about scratches?\"\n\nIt says right there not to make illegal copies of the disc. The law dogs are coming for ya.\n\nA simpler time\n\nThat’s a hell of a friend\n\nRub some toothpaste on it and it’ll still load up\n\nDid they get it from Avenge Rugs??\n\nCan you super bounce on it\n\nSo wait where did they get it though? Because I theoretically would absolutely purchase one\n\nThat’s a good friend\n\nnice\n\nFor everyone wondering. Don't order these from etsy or instagram ads. They're all dropshipped from Ali.\n\nHell Yea\n\nThat's dope.\n\nMany?\n\nDamn you gonna need a xbox the size of a sofa to play that\n\nI never knew i wanted this so badly untill right now\n\n“I’m duel wielding my smg”\n\nVery cool 👍\n\nI'm not even a Halo fan, but it would just feel wrong to me to walk on that.\n\nHalo 2 is the greatest trick that the devil ever pulled\n\nThat is cool as shit\n\nSo is it an illegal copy of the disc? XD\n\nnot bad, not bad\n\nDon’t lay it upside down or a ring of death will be created\n\nStrong memories of putting on the Halo soundtrack to drive me and my friends to pick up a copy of Halo 2.\n\nyour cd is a bit wrinkly\n\nI tried getting a melee version of this for a friend's bday but everywhere I looked had terrible reviews. He able to share where he got it?\n\nThat's dope! Reminds me of how amazing it was to be able to use 2 weapons\n\ngimme gimme gimme gimme\n\nYou have a GOAT friend.\n\nI keep getting ads for these rugs\n\nWhere can I get one ?\n\nThat’s a cool friend you got there.\n\nCan you introduce me to our friend ;)\n\nDoes it work\n\nMy PTSD could never, I would immediately flip that carpet over !\n\nFirstly, awesome friend! Secondly, I hope you're at least 30. Thirdly, I'm jealous.\n\nWhen he gave it to you were you blinded by its majesty?\n\nThis makes me feel a lot better of getting the rug that looks like the Sarlacc pit :-D\n\nThought It was a huge CD for a min lol\n\nToo me a second to realise what this was but it's amazing\n\nAwesome\n\nTHAT IS SIIIIIIIIIICK!!!\n\nWow terrifying\n\nDo you know where your friend got this from?\n\nOP is ready to finish the fight!\n\nLink?\n\nWow, this blows me away.\n\nJelly, that would look good in my game room.\n\nGaming\n\nI'd totally hang that on the wall\n\nI pay this game   \nBut not like it\n\nthe joy and rush of memories I felt just from seeing this.

    "all_comment_text": "Alien Isolation still stands alone in the 'games that stressed me out so much I had to pause at times' category. But in a good way. Damn they really did the IP justice! Just an amazing design all around. Really captures the mood of the movies (fear and anxiety)\n\nI was so pumped to finally play this game but the first time the Alien showed up for me, I turned the game off and never returned.\n\nHaha this have me a chuckle\nBut yeah it’s a white knuckle game sure\n\nShit.  I actually found the Synthetics to be way scarier.\n\nYou are becoming hysterical. \n\nRunning causes accidents.\n\nI will catch you.\n\n*continues to bash your head like a pumpkin\n\nFun times :)\n\nOddly specific username.... hmmmm...\n\nSame here, and that goes for most horror games.  I love horror movies, books, haunted houses... \n\nYou give me horror media, I generally like it.  Games are a different story.  Took me forever to beat RE Village because of the basement fetus, but I pulled through.  Couldn't finish Alien Isolation, and there are many more I have that are going untouched because I happened to watch gameplay footage.\n\nFYI I almost didn't buy Resident Evil 7 and 8 because they looked terrifying, despite really liking the style, but it wasn't too bad. Monsters are a lot less scary when you can shoot them to death. You can't kill the xeno. \n\nOh yeah, I have had no problems finishing games like Dead Space or other Resident Evil iterations. I think what it comes down to is being helpless in tight spaces freaks me out, even in more action oriented horror games where I can fight back.\n\nOutlast scared the shit out of me.\n\nIt really followed the amnesia dynamic of run and hide, can't fight back\n\n\nBut outlast had a gimmick with a camcorder that was your only way to see in the dark.\n\nWhen you lose it during a moment in the story I legitimately started losing my actual shit.\n\nI actually managed to finish Alien Isolation a few weeks after launch, even if it gave me heart attacks.\n\nSince not a lot of people finished or even played it: the further you play, the more weapons you get (and also, more Aliens show up). You still can't kill them, but a shotgun blast to the face or some good ol flamethrower usage actually scares them off for a bit.\n\nLike I said, you still can't kill them. But you feel not as defenless as ik the beginning.\n\nOne of my all-time fave YT videos is about the AI in Isolation. It basically has an RPG-style skill tree, where every time you use a skill it gets better at knowing how to deal with it. I haven't played the game but I've heard that excessive flamethrower use can result in it just waiting to see if you run out of fuel.\n\n“The game has an extensive skill tree and progression system, that truly emphasizes a stealth assassin-based play style”\n\nOh, cool!\n\n**”The player isn’t the one who has access to this skill tree.”**\n\nYeah, that totally happens. If you overuse it, the alien is also less and less scared of it.\n\nBut the later stages of the game get quite System Shock like, were you can also craft a lot of items to distract the alien. Stuff like noise decoys and pipe bombs, if I recall correctly. So, if you played smart, you always had a different tool or weapon to scare off or distract the alien.\n\nAlien isolation for you is outlast for me. I tried playing that game 4 separate times, had to quit mid way. Will try again this winter vacation\n\nThat really dark sewer part with Ol'Janglepants, right?\n\nDude i ddnt even get to that one, i was still o  the 2nd floor and a crazy guy chased me. Had to quit and cleanse my soul after that\n\nOh man, I was playing in 3D on a 100\" projector screen on a wall. If you're talking about when you come across the big guy patrolling, I barely escaped to that gap you have to squeeze through, and when I looked back his arm came shooting a foot out of the wall causing me and my friend to instinctively lean back and almost fall out of our chairs.\n\nGood times.\n\nThat basement man. I have a hard time with it even on whatever playthrough I'm currently on. \n\nI love getting scared in games but that place actually entered into the sheer terror range the first time.\n\nduring that first “battle” with the alien where you have to unlock the door meanwhile the alien is somewhere in the room and at any point could see you\n\nI heard noises behind me while I was frantically unlocking the door and after I got through it I shit myself so hard and uninstalled the game\n\nmaybe Ill have to play it again but holy shit was that the most scared Ive ever been\n\nMy second playthrough, the very first time the alien hunts you while you have to wait for the tram-car-thing I somehow got turned around in the dark of that room while waiting for the car to come and was in panic mode because I knew the alien was searching for me but I never saw it. Just running scared not knowing if I was anywhere near where I should be. The car finally arrives and I rush through the door. I breath a sigh of relief as I hit the button to shut the door. I turn around to watch it close and right when it starts to, the fucking thing comes out of the darkness faster than I've ever seen it move and jump-scares the shit out of me while I'm being murdered.\n\nI was so scared but so satisfied with the game. I do not get startled or jump-scares easily. I am not sure a video game has ever rattled me like that. It's so well made.\n\nAnd it's like 18 more HOURS of that, it is a horrendously long game\n\nI think I put in around 3 hrs before I quit.\n\nI mean it's much easier after that point. It's still tense but once you get the Flamethrower and can actually ward off the alien when it sees you, it's not nearly as difficult/scary. \n\nThe first hours are probably the best, scariest parts. The ending was a little too drawn out for my taste.\n\nI made it all the way through. Once. I don’t plan on doing it again.\n\nDitto. Mainly because it was incredibly long for a linear horror game. Very much a slog those last 5 or so hours.\n\nOh yeah, I love the game to death but it definitely overstayed its welcome by a good amount of hours. To be fair though, that was the era of games where people REALLY harped on games for not being 30+ hour long experiences. And people, for some reason, would equate dollar amounts to hours played. So being a full priced release, they stretched it out to satisify those folks.\n\nI think if it released nowadays, there would be zero complaints about it being shorter. Gamers tend to appreciate a game that knows when its done.\n\nAnd it was made by a strategy game developer, insane.\n\nreally puts gamedev into perspective - a strategy game studio can make a masterpiece like alien: isolation, and a studio that made watch dogs can somehow forget how to make a watch dogs game\n\nWell lets not give them too much credit. One year they make alien isolation and then they fuck up bad ladt few years with troy/pharoh total wars and seem to be tone deaf to their loyal fanbase\n\nThat same dev team was actually making an extraction shooter called hyenas that was cancelled by Sega at the 11th hour. They are all looking for work now. \n\nThe strategy team fucked up all on their own. Actually they’ve been fucking up pretty consistently since Rome 2, really.\n\nCA was absolute god tier when I was a kid but like all studios owned bo publicly traded publishers they eventually had brain drain and are not the old studio in any way but name\n\nIt’s too bad because they’ve had some flashes of the old brilliance here and there over the last decade. Attila was pretty awesome overall, WH2 was a really good time, Troy actually turned out to be a solid entry when they finished it. They’ve just been held back by tech debt from their weird engine and absolutely atrocious C-suite decisions.\n\n\"The alien has been broken, the day is ours\"\n\nI really wanted to play it but it was too spooky for me. Like the absolute chickenshit that I am I ended up treating it as a movie and watched a no commentary playthrough instead.\n\nI did the exact same thing because I was getting 20 heart attacks every hour.\n\nNow think about the fact that there is a VR mod.\n\nI DON'T WANT TO.\n\nThe VR mod played on the hardest difficulty where your scanner doesn't work is certainly an experience.\n\nWorst I ever shit myself was realising for the first time that it could follow me into the vents. 154 pulse-rate, I recorded it as I played.\n\nAnd that there is functionality for the Xeno to hear your microphone...\n\ni played through that although im not a horror fan. the game is just perfect in VR. probably the best along wirh alyx.\n\nI keep thinking... what if they made a Terminator game in the same way, where it stalks you and you have to get from place to place. There are times where you have to make a break for it and the best you can do is slow it down.\n\nAnd make it an open world environment where the terminator can blend in with NPCs\n\nHas this concept been done before? That's such a good idea but I can't think of any horror game where the monster hides in plain sight like that\n\nAssassins creed multiplayer comes to mind. Anyone can be hunting you, the only thing that separates them from NPC's is how stupid and jittery they are.\n\nProblem with terminators and making them blend in with NPC's is they'd be truly Indistinguishable from normal people, and unless they were limited to walking up on your and breaking your neck, it'd be virtually impossible to pick them apart behavior wise.\n\nIf they were like the old T-600's, it'd be pretty obvious. But nobody cares about the cash for clunkers grandpa's sarsaparilla bottles target practice terminators. They care about the T-1000, or the T-X type things where its all adaptable liquid skin.\n\nI suppose in theory the T-1000 would be perfect for this, but the problem is the T-1000 was meant to be extremely intelligent, not concerned with blending in beyond a glance. \n\nIt would be constantly running after you and wouldn't bother hiding. Although if it gankgstalked you and only appeared to ambush you like the aliens do, that'd be a different story. \n\nBut it goes against the terminators behavior. Ironically the T-X never had these issues, as it behaved exactly like the alien did. It preferred doing so.\n\nT-X gangstalked the fuck out of John connor until it had a chance to strike. But everyone hates even stomaching the passing thought of T3 or anything related to it. so comic book terminators it is\n\nGhost Recon Break Point did a cross over event where a T100 followed you. It was a wicked fun mode to play! You could get away from it by fast traveling but the map would show the red dot of the T100 tracking you with persistence. Eventually you had to just battle it out with the Terminator because it would always find you. \n\nThey also did a Predator cross over mission in Wildlands. Cool stuff.\n\nClosest thing to that I’ve experienced was Mr X in Resi 2.\n\nJust the menacing walking towards you making you feel constantly under pressure. Stressed me out so much as a kid.\n\nHonestly, while I give a ton of credit to the dev team, it cannot be understated how awesome the studio that owns the rights to the Alien IP was to assist them in capturing the atmosphere. If not for their assistance, it probably still would have been excellent but that game is dripping in Alien’s aesthetic.\n\nIt’s mindblowing how Sega recovered from the absolute \n\n#CLUSTERFUCK\n\nof a Aliens Colonial Marines and made one of the best survival games of the past decade\n\nIt's one of the all time greats of its genre.\n\nI will never forget the dude who used to rent off me buying that collectors edition. Laughed my fucking ass off, cause that dude was a piece of shit and deserved that game.\n\nOnly horror game I’ve played and completed. I’m a big scaredy cat but I love Alien/Aliens and it’s an absolutely visually stunning game.\n\nPure genius of them to quietly include support for microphone. I wonder how many people got absolutely jumpscared by the xenomorph while hiding simply because they didn't realize *the game is listening to your microphone and uses it as a factor in whether the xenomorph can find you.*\n\nDamn, that may be why I quit. No matter how much I hid and pressed the button to hold my breath, the damn xeno always honed in right on me. Made me just put the game away out of annoyance.\n\nReally?? That’s kinda fucked up in the best way! Now I need to check this game out…\n\nI played like an hour or so of it. I never even encountered the alien. It's the only game I've ever played that was so good that I didn't want to play it. The atmosphere and the tension and the anticipation/anxiety was too much.\n\nYeah, the game really felt like you were living the Alien movie. I consider it to be a better sequel to the original three than Resurrection and Covenant.\n\nWas playing this game with a friend of mine, we had to stop 30 mins in because she was about to get a panic attack. \n\nWe weren't even close to seeing our first alien yet.\n\nThis game atmosphere alone is so great, it can cause panic attacks even when nothing is happening. God I love how good that game is.\n\nYeah, the fact that the game is still talked about this long after it's release is a testament to how much they nailed it. I could only play it in 20 minute snippets once a day. It really got my adrenaline pumping. I eventually beat it, and jesus what a journey it was.\n\nCan’t believe it’s 10 years old\n\nAlien Isolation and Dead Space will always be on my \"Wish I could play this again for the first time\" list. Absolute thrillers through and through. Isolation was especially groundbreaking for the console it launched on.\n\nMost of these are extremely bad timing for the release.   \nEspecially Titanfall 2 was insane to release at that date between MASSIVE games.\n\nBoth titanfalls were sent out to die.\n\nTF2 came out the week between COD:IW and BF1. Impossible to get much traction.\n\nTF1 was released in the middle of nowhere, in march.\n\nThe fucking release date picking of that series was awful.\n\nWasn't titanfall 1 a new ip from a new studio? Seems like a nice empty month with nothing going on would be a good time to let something that take it's shot, especially in contrant to titanfalls 2 release date\n\nIt was a new IP, that was a launch title for the Xbox One admist the whole \"Kinect will be required for the Console\" debacle.\n\nIt wasn't a launch title, it was still in the early days of the Xbox One but it was still a bad time to be an xbox exclusive, it had ginormous download sizes, and it was online multiplayer only, something that was unheard of for a full physical release in 2014.\n\nI distinctly remember buying the Xbox One Titanfall Bundle.\n\nCame with a little card I held up to the Kinect which scanned it and started the game download.\n\nMy jaw dropped at 40 gigabytes, I couldn't believe it.\n\nThen the other day I tried to download an NBA game on Gamepass and it was like 130 gb. Unreal.\n\nWorst part: most of those 40 GB was uncompressed audio data! Just raw .wav files. MP3 and OGG exist for a reason. Having all of those gunfire noises overlap means that the extra quality from not compressing anything is not gonna be noticeable. Might as well safe a little space and compress it. \n\nThis goes for an awful lot of modern games. Instead of optimizing the install size we just put it all on there because storage is cheap anyway. Even worse when consoles still had spinning rust. Games got so big that the hard drive had trouble accessing files fast enough, so devs put multiple copies of certain files spread out across the drive. Which of course baloons the install size even further.\n\nTF1 was also exclusive to Xbox as well along with the \"campaign\" being just more online matches with some story stuff being yelled as you played. I got in on PC at launch and had a blast but it definitely had a lot holding it back.\n\nI know people love to blame EA but this was Respawn's own exec fault. They made CoD, got fucked by Activision, left to make Respawn and really want TF to be the CoD killer. EA greenlit 2 sequels and when they presented Apex Legends EA was wanting TF3.\n\nAnd Rebirth has the whole \"middle child\" syndrome plus being an exclusive. Quite sad tho, best FF game in a hot minute.\n\nIt’s more that less people have ps5s than ps4s. 50 million vs 115 million.\n\nExclusivity is part of it, I'm one of the people who's waiting for the PC version, absolutely loved remake but can't justify buying a PS5\n\nSame. I was about to buy a whole-ass PS5 just for this game then thought \"WTF am I doing, I have a PC stronger than a PS5, all I have to do is wait a few months to play it.\"\n\nAlso respawn is doing just fine.\n\nNuh uh, they only made...\n\n*checks notes*\n\n...$2 billion on their free to play BR game\n\nYeah because of Apex and Fallen order games. The game in said picture\\[Titanfall games\\] definitely could have and should done much better.\n\nThat's irrelevant to the discussion, though. Titanfall 2 should have did better, that's the point. The conversation isn't around the company. And yeah they're doing fine because of Apex. That proves our point even more. A casual BR game is making billions while the Titfanfall games, which were literally their heart and soul, flopped.\n\nAnd Dead Space remake between Callisto Protocol and Resident Evil 4\n\nIt didn't help that Callisto Protocol looked so good and was hyped up, then ended up sucking and getting forgotten, while also taking thunder away from the DS remake. Having never played the DS games I thought \"nice, I'll play a spiritual successor that looks great!\" then I watched videos and reviews... And skipped it and the DS remake.\n\nThe first Dead Space game is worth your time, remake or not.\n\nDS remake is an absolute must. I am not a big fan of remakes and I played the original DS series. This remake is just worth every single bit of money and time I put on it.\n\nMake a good game + Make it sell well\n\n\nDevs + publisher/marketing\n\nYeap. I don't think you can avoid the marketing part unfortunately.   \nIf you are extremely lucky there will be a natural one from player to player, not a forced paid one.  \nBut it's extremely rare, and mostly on single player games. If a multiplayer game dies early, it's dead dead.\n\nI need another mirror's edge\n\nSame. I played through the original again a few months back and it's great. Catalyst was alright, but changing the story really did it no favours in my eyes.\n\nWhile it was still fun... But it just did not had the magic the first had. Also the change in visual style was not the smartest move.\n\nCatalyst had amazing atmosphere and soundtrack but the open world didn't work out. Sidequests were all repetitive variants of run from here to there real fast. Most collectibles requiring you to stop running, lose all your momentum just to watch a repetitive animation, so brain-dead. The game needed way more of those Gridnode and secret backpack - platforming/exploration type puzzles and some other variety. A slightly more lively city wouldn't have hurt. NPCs stood rooted to the same spot day and night the whole game regardless of if you finished their quest or it was yet to be unlocked. Barely any other people to be seen.\n\nThat said it was a joy to just open up and run around, the city was gorgeous, soundtrack so beautiful, running was satisfying, the vibes were immaculate, it was all so relaxing. Nothing quite like it. It's bittersweet how equally special and mid the game was. I remember DICE saying they were \"taking their time\" with the sequel because they wanted to get it \"just right\". Bullshit that was the best you could do?\n\nThe problem is it was an \"open-world\" game that forced you to pass through the same three narrow chokepoints on every journey in order to get anywhere. Its clearly a memory thing — they're just areas where the game unloads the previous area and loads the next area — but in a game built entirely around moving about the map it makes it pretty boring to move about the map.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOn top of that: I have a pretty good sense of direction. I distinctly remember opening up the game and wanting to just run around in the general direction of where I want to go, slowly learning the layout of the city over time, like you can do with a real city. One of the first things I tried was turning off all the HUD elements telling you where to go and using landmarks as guidance.\n\nIt doesn't work, and trying it really reveals the game's flaws. There aren't really any good landmarks to use, you never really get a good sense of where you are in the city, and you have to follow the HUD because its the only way to find the singular connector you need to load the next area. The game uses the HUD as a crutch to keep you moving, when the environment should be doing it for you. I have no problem with the HUD being available for people without a sense of direction, but it shouldn't be necessary to play the game.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIts just one of those small design decisions taken early in development that you wouldn't think would make much difference and didn't even notice you made — \"well obviously we need a HUD\" — but actually has a massive effect on the rest of the project. All the other systems were built on top of that HUD, and when you turn it off, it shows.\n\nIts still a decent game overall, but I haven't gone back to replay it. They missed an opportunity.\n\nYeah I'm a diehard lover of the first game. I haven't even beat the second.\n\nI literally bought my Xbox One to play catalyst after I beat the first game because I had fallen so I love with it. I bought catalyst before I even owned my Xbox to play it on. It was the first game I booted up.\n\nI still haven't finished it.\n\nMirrors Edge had such wonderfully crafted levels that you could play over and over again to learn all the little shortcuts and tricks. Having an open world just wasn’t the same.\n\nCrossing rooftops by the same weird skybridge over and over made it feel to samey.\n\nLoved the first. Couldn't bother with Catalyst. Stopped playing really early on.\n\nInteresting. I loved Catalyst. To me it was everything the original was but just with more content and better graphics. Wish there was a third.\n\nI finally played Catalyst last year after years of refusing and spending time on the og.\n\nIn all honesty, I would say catalyst is more fun casually. It looks nice, controls are nice and fluid, you can just run and run and get that hour of stress relief. Once I completed everything there was to do though, I didn't feel the sort of spark I got from the og that made me want to keep replaying it.\n\nIn other words, Catalyst is fun to complete, and for the occasional run about. The original is fun to replay and speedrun.\n\nA lot of these have specific circumstances that didn’t help their situations. I’ll speak to the ones I’m familiar with.\n\nTitanfall 2 was wedged between two enormous releases and essentially sent out to die\n\nAlan Wake 2 still hasn’t launched on Steam and didn’t get a physical release on consoles, which turned off some would-be buyers\n\nHi-Fi Rush was not only shadow dropped which is a gamble in itself, but also released directly into GamePass which hinders the sales potential a lot\n\nRebirth as with any other successful Square Enix game is shackled with the responsibility of balancing the books from failures such as Forspoken, Babylon’s Fall, and Avengers. This makes the sales expectations far higher than they need to be.\n\nI seem to recall Mirror’s Edge coming out as a single player campaign that lasted 7ish hours during the era where online multiplayer a la Xbox Live was really popular\n\nAlso, even then, 7ish hours was considered pretty short for a single player game.\n\nIf someone reading your comment remembers the Uncharted games, let's not forget they all had multiplayer modes on PS3\n\nI remember putting hundreds of hours into Uncharted 2 multiplayer, it was genuinely fun and had shit loads of costumes to unlock to keep you playing, *none of which you had to pay for by the way*\n\nAlmost every game that came out after COD 4 had a multiplayer mode. \n\nSpec Ops the Line, a game which basically existed to criticize Call of Duty and the 360 Generation military shooter as a concept, had a COD styled multiplayer mode.\n\nMirror's Edge is probably my favorite game of that era, I think it had such a simple, pure formula that was near perfect. The level design was fantastic and it never tried to be anything other than what it was. I can still replay that game and be happy, and very few games manage that simplicity.\n\nThat said, I was a young teen with no job so I didn't even buy it until it was 14 bucks in the bargain bin at Walmart. I could just get so much more value out of Gears of War, CoD and Halo. I got to spend time with my friends, I got literally hundreds of hours out of each game. Just couldn't justify spending birthday or christmas money on a full price release that was a linear single player with no meat on the back end.\n\nI also love the overall design and atmosphere of ME. Part of what made me less interested in the sequel is that they went for a more \"realistic\" look.\n\nA lot of these games just had piss poor advertising campaigns as well. I love and have played most of them, but I also I don’t remember seeing a single ad before most of these games’ releases.\n\nFor example, I’m not really interested in FF7, but the first remake had tons of hype and advertising around it. This time around I didn’t even know the second game was out until I started seeing a couple clips on YouTube.\n\nI've seen FF7 characters advertising positive mental health around my city at bus stops.\n\nFeeling Imposter Syndrome?\n\nHave you considered you might be repressing the trauma of watching your childhood hero kill your entire town and your family, being captured and experimented on in an effort to make you a mind-controlled soldier for said childhood hero, being deemed a failure and tossed into cryo until your best friend breaks out, going on the run for a year, and then in an attempt to cope with your best friend sacrificing himself for you subconsciously form a new identity based off of him?\n\n&amp;nbsp; \n\nIt's more likely than you think!\n\nHonestly, pretty much every main character in FF7 would need years of therapy. \n\nHave you ever been kept in isolation since birth being experimented on because you're the last of an ancient race until you were a young child before escaping and watching your mother die in front of you while bystanders did nothing, then being socially isolated for having strange abilities, then falling in love with a cool soldier that ghosts you for five years, then watching an extremely similar-looking soldier literally crash into and crush the flowers you were growing? &gt;!And then also get visions of the future that you have to die to save the world?!&lt;\n\nHonestly, Aerith should be a supervillain.\n\nI considered myself a big Alan Wake fan, and I had no idea Alan Wake 2 was releasing. I found out a month later.\n\nI didn't realise rebirth was out until I saw spoilers and Tifa bikini clips on Reddit either. Went out and bought a PS5 immediately, literally a console shifter for me, now I've bought FF16 cause why not while I'm here.\n\nare you me. thats exactly how i found out about rebirth and thats exactly what i did lmfao. even bought ff16 because it was 50% off and i already got a ps5\n\nI'd wager that has more to do with with the amount of buzz that announcing a remake of Final Fantasy VII causes compared to announcing the second part that people already knew was coming. They did a similar amount of marketing imo, it's just that it naturally creates a much smaller splash than announcing the entire remake project does.\n\nRebirth is also the middle-child in a remake trilogy, and is locked to a much smaller install base than the first part.\n\nAdd on that Remake was essentially lightning in a bottle. Releasing a hugely requested remake right before Covid on a system that's over 100m users. Rebirth just simply was never gonna get close. \n  \nEdit: To add on as lots of other people pointing out, it also hurts Rebirth if people didn't like Remake. Whether it's for the altered story, combat, or multi installments. If you didn't like Remake, or want to wait for all 3, you wouldn't buy the sequel either.\n\nIt actually happened one month after the lockdowns. Just as gaming was sky rocketing.\n\nLet's also not forget that Remake was not exactly what people expected. I think a ton of people bought it expecting an almost 1 to 1 remake, got upset at the changes, didn't finish and then didn't buy into Rebirth.\n\nLiterally the only place I've seen Hi-Fi Rush discussed is Reddit. No one I know, both online and IRL, has played or talked about it. I think the gameplay is just too niche.\n\nAlan Wake 2: It sounds like they avoided the primary way to release for every platform they released on? What?\n\n&gt; Alan Wake 2 still hasn’t launched on Steam and didn’t get a physical release on consoles, which turned off some would-be buyers\n\nIt’s me. I’m “would-be buyers”.\n\n[deleted]\n\nGreat games don't get investments. Games that make money get investments. \n\nThat's the industry that we created so that's what we get.\n\nThis. People like to blame the companies making the games for shitty DLCs, microtransactions, and battle passes.\n\nIn reality, they're just responding to the market. Why would they stop making it if people are still giving them money for it.\n\nThis is the American-Arcadia argument: The people that set up the system initially are long retired or dead.  There's no semblance of personality or character in charge of these syndicates - they have essentially reverted back to true animalistic instincts; Decision-By-Committee is only interested in self-preservation and the bottom line.\n\nAnytime you try to hold somebody accountable, the corporation will just put a new suit at the top. If the Board of Execs is ousted, new execs will be elected and nothing will change. If there's anyone to point the finger at, it's the audience for continuing to make it profitable.\n\nonce you realize you can make 500k off joke meme horse armor you really can't put that cat back in the bag.\n\n[removed]\n\nMore specifically, it was the sparkle horse from the cash shop. The first cash shop mount. So a single MTX made in WoW made more money than total sales of Wings of Liberty.\n\nIdk I remember when micro transactions started and I started to boycot games.  Can’t remember which CoD it was but they tried charging for skins that you literally could custom create in the game before.  Friends all talked shit saying I was being dramatic.\n\n“Meh just don’t buy.  It will correct itself.” Aged like fine milk.\n\nSome of them still buy every battlepass/dlc\n\n&gt;Some of them still buy every battlepass/dlc\n\nThis is the problem. I almost never buy that stuff, but 1 person who buys all of then will make up for 5 people walking away from a game. \n\nCompanies end up with whales that buy every single thing they put out that makes up for the rest.\n\nIt gets worse when you also take into account the generations that are raised/brought in under this model where it's all they know and they don't have a 'better times' to reference back to the same way that some of us do. Like, how do you rebel against a system when it's the only one you've ever known kind of thing, if that makes sense.\n\nThats true. A lot of young people may see nothing wrong with it as it's all they've really known. Combine that with their favorite content creators making pack opening videos and it become super normalized.\n\nWorse, I've watched young people turn away from a game because it *didn't* have a store or battle pass feature.\n\nIt’s even less than 1 in 5 for profitability. Iirc “whales” only make up something like 2% of everyone playing a game and they spend more than enough to make up for the other 98%\n\nI always remember the story of someone spending $15,000 on Mass Effect multiplayer cards. Like how do you \"vote with your wallet\" when the person voting yes are legitimately addicted insanely? You not buying \"counts\" like 60$ max, meanwhile people voting yes can just funnel all their credit cards into it.\n\nReminds me that EA said they went all in on loot boxes because the Mass Effecr 3 multi-player raked in so much cash on the loot boxes. Ya EA put them in but the people keep buying them.\n\nI've tried to fight it by avoiding giving money to games with predatory and/or overly expensive models, but sometimes it feels like trying to stop a tsunami with your fists.\n\nYeah one person can only do so much when kids with moms credit card will still dole out for every new skin.\n\nThat’s not “the industry we created” that’s “industry” full stop. The gaming industry is, has been, and always will be a profit driven enterprise.\n\nIt’s no different than when good TV shows get cancelled, movies don’t get sequels, an app gets shut down, etc.\n\nThis is why arcade games were often stupid hard back in the day.   got to feed the beast quarters/tokens\n\nthat moment that seemed like it was designed to unfairly kill you. it was. had to make you spend more.\n\na lot of times you will look at moments like that and think \"oh they just didnt know what they were doing, old games so quirky with seemingly unfair shit\"  no no no my friend they knew exactly how unfair that was\n\n&gt; no my friend they knew exactly how unfair that was\n\nnot only arcades. When publishers noticed that people were actually buying guide books, they suddenly asked their developers to make their games harder and started to publish their own guides.\n\n_publishing executive takes notes:_ “more live service games.. check”\n\nEverybody hates big publishers like EA but back when they were funding stuff like Brutal Legend, Mirror’s Edge, Alice: Madness Returns, and Shadows of the Damned/Lollipop Chainsaw nobody was buying them. \n\n\nGreedy publishers might suck but gamers with big mouths that don’t actually support games are just as bad.\n\n&gt; Brutal Legend, Mirror’s Edge, Alice: Madness Returns, and Shadows of the Damned/Lollipop Chainsaw\n\nI did my part and bought every single one of those. All flawed but great games.\n\nSame here. Not perfect games but the music and art design makes most of them worth it on that alone.\n\nAs someone who was too poor and could only watch others/play Alice at my friends, thank you\n\nEven now, ever since 2019, EA's output has been very versatile and unique but nobody really talks about them. They occasionally splurge on a big new IP like Immortals of Aveum (which flopped), shows you how people don't really care, they just wanna say the same old opinion and move on\n\nI was really surprised that EA had such a quiet year now.  \n  \nNext to the standard mill of nhl, fifa etc.   \nThey basically had a very quiet year after jedi survivor. \n\nImmortals was 1 title and now Tales of Kenzera. Which is 2 titles in a year.\n\nDecapitatioooooooooooonnnnnnn!\n\nBrutal Legend was a fun romp. It's a very niche game, but if you're in its target market, very enjoyable.\n\nFor real man\n\nI will die on that hill that Titan Fall 2 is one of the most well crafted multiplayer shooters I have ever played.\n\nI have no idea what EA was thinking by releasing it the week between COD and Battlefield. It should have come out earlier that year, as I think releasing it when they did is why it didn't do better. \n\nRespawn have admitted that the release date was their idea, not EAs.\n\nEverything that EA touches that turns bad, it's EA's fault.  Everything that EA touches that turns good, it's because of the developers.\n\nNot that I'm a fan of EA, but that's about the gist of what to expect, even when talking about Bioware and Titanfall 2.\n\ndistinct unique berserk act consider late cough correct deserve oil\n\nI yet have to play TF2, but CoD IW was shit and BF1 is easily one of the best Battlefield games out there.\n\nTF2 is the greatest FPS campaign of all time.\n\nI’ve never played a game before that made you feel like such a bad ass. Running and jumping and sliding around infantrymen just blasting your way through. Then you hop into a mech suit and just unleash hell. So fucking awesome.\n\nThe time travel level is easily the most well designed FPS level ever\n\nI dont even like shooters that much, but i miss titanfall 2. The campaign was 10/10 easy and the multiplayer was fun and unique. Now EA is going all in on Apex and im sad\n\nprey 2017 should be in this list too\n\nI see you are of culture.\n\nDev studio for hi fi rush just shutdown\n\nThey also developed Ghostwire Tokyo, which is a lot more relevant as to why they were shut down.\n\nwhich is a shame, GT has a lot of makings of a good game.  the story and atmosphere are really, really good, and Shibuya is beautifully crafted. \n\njust the combat, even after they redid it for the spider's threat update, still was kind of repetitive.   A sequel could have really given them the ability to make something great and make it a masterpiece.\n\nIf the entire game was like the free dlc quest with the school it would have been a lot better received\n\nGhostwire Tokyo got mostly decent reviews and while it wasn't exactly groundbreaking, it was generally received ok.  Did decent sales-wise and met expectations, and was successful enough to slate a sequel which was supposed to drop sometime between now and March next year, at least as of the Activision acquisition.\n\nAnd Evil Within 2. Despite how good the game was, it was a fucking flop. Barely sold like a third of the first game.\n\nYeah that news inspired me to make this post actually. Sad day, man.\n\nWasn't a fan of the game but it sucks to see people lose their jobs\n\nWouldn't being platform exclusives play a bit of a factor for some games here?\n\nYes. Square Enix is really dumb. Not only FF7 Rebirth is exclusive, but when it finally launches on PC it is very likely that it will be a Epic Games Store exclusive for a year like the last one.\n\nFor fuck's sake.\n\nUgh epic store can go fuck itself\n\nWill see if I can wait for it to be on steam I guess\n\nReason why Tango got closed: Not because Hifi Rush did great, but because Evil within 2 and Ghostwire did horrible. You can only lose $ for so long before your owner prioritizes somebody else.\n\nWhen I read Tango was closed indefinitely, I thought that was a bunch of malarkey until I saw the news that they’re being shut down today. My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined\n\nRhythm music games aren't exactly the most popular genre and if your best game is that, I could see it being an issue.\n\nEvery single one of their games sold poorly, even Hifi Rush barely turned a profit, if it even did.  It’s not that they make bad games, it’s that they’re not profitable.  A corporation is out to make money and they weren’t making money.  \n\nUnfortunately, it’s just how the market is and I hate it.  I don’t play a single one of these F2P games that dominate the sales charts, nor do I ever spend money on micro-transactions in any capacity.  It just seems like the games I like are being largely phased out, because they’re not what people are drawn to anymore.\n\nVisceral did not do the Dead Space remake, they were long gone when Motive did the remake.\n\nI'm confused why you bring that up. Did anyone imply they did? OP is just pointing out that some great games still sell poorly.\n\nAnd despite the remake being stellar, a remake for DS2 ~~was canned~~ is unlikely\n\nNever announced.\n\nIt was not canned, it was not even announced.\n\nI’m not sure why FF7 is on there. Even if sales were below expectations, the money Sony paid for exclusivity probably more than makes up for it.\n\nThat and a lot of us are waiting for the pc release.\n\nAnd SE has a history of having absolutely, ridiculously, unrealistic sales targets\n\nDead Space, Titanfall 2, Alien Isolation, and Alan Wake 2 are my favorite games of all time. Unfortunately, AAA horror games don't seem to make the money publishers want. And as for Titanfall, EA fumbled that release schedule big time. \n\nI should really find a healthy and successful franchise to fall in love with because all of my current favorites continue to get shelved/cancelled.\n\nJust as an FYI.\nEA were not responsible at all for the release schedule of Titanfall 2.\n\nEA actually went to Respawns director and questioned them about moving the release date 2 months down the line to avoid the release buildup and give more time for polish.\nIt was Respawn specifically who decided to release when they did as they confirmed themselves at the time.\n\nFuck me, thats just the same situation they had with Jedi Survivor where EA told them they could delay the game but respawn insisted on releasing anyway and moving to the next project...\n\nSame as me. Haven't played AW2 yet actually but Control was one of my favorites of all time. It's doing okay I guess but nothing mind blowing in terms of sales. Great games just don't sell sometimes. They really deserve more, especially Hi-Fi Rush. That game is so good and a lot of love went into it.\n\nPour one out for Okami. \n\n  \nAlso, sad that we'll never get an Evil Within 3.\n\n[Here's your reminder that Alien Isolation was the recipient of one of the worst fucking reviews of all time: IGN gave it a **5.9** and called it \"*mediocre*\".](https://youtu.be/kc1MwlTwv3E?si=tFKM3o2m9rjX-O3X)\n\nTo this day people are still disliking the YouTube video and commenting on it telling IGN how incredibly wrong they were.\n\nBut it's too late now, that review had a huge impact on its sales ten years ago.\n\nTitanfall 2 is on sale just now, id recommend it purely for the campaign alone.\n\nReddit subs across all types of media have the idea that quality=success is an easy and simple formula, it is not.\n\nFF7 Rebirth would have done better if it was multiplatform.\n\nI'm curious to how many casuals thought the first was a remake of the whole game and are now waiting for the whole thing to be released to experience it all at once or if many are waiting expecting Rebirth to be free on plus before the next game.\n\nKnowing it'll be years before the next installment killed the excitement for a *lot* of people.\n\nYep, me being one of them. At some point down the line I'll binge all three on PC once I can.\n\nI am absolutely waiting for the full trilogy to be out on steam, and I knew that ahead of time.\n\nGreat set! Psychonauts belongs to this list.\n\nLove the EGS drama surrounding AW2, shows clearly what single minded platform worship does to critical thinking.\n\nAW2 could not exist without Epic. Wishlists mean F all, if you need to fund development of AAA games.  \n  \n\"What ever there's plenty of games like it on steam.\"   \nA literal 2 category BAFTA winner in horror genre, with writing easily matching or even surpassing top tier movies/series.   \nYeah those just pour down from the skies all the time /S\n\nSeeing rebirth there HURTS. Legit GOTY and one my favorite games of all time man…… it’s almost perfect."

    "all_comment_text": "You mean casting the worst possible choices for the game characters and releasing the movie years after the height of the franchises popularity didn’t  work out the way they hoped?!\n\nKevin hart as the big ass soldier. Kill me.\n\nRoland was a tall, stoic, serious soldier with a goal. Kevin Hart feels like he's the exact opposite of that.\n\nThats the thing, Roland is the straight man (As much as anyone can be) in Borderlands 2. He's the one with a plan and serious goals.\n\nIf you'd asked me who they were likely to cast for the role, I would have said Idris Elba. He's great playing straight characters as foils in comedies so it seemed like a no-brainer. Kevin Hart? That's just fucking stupid. Both because it's a nonsensical casting choice, and because I really don't enjoy his performances.\n\nIdris Elba would have been an utterly awesome casting choice for Roland.\n\nIf they were going with a comic, someone out of left field like Omar Sy would have been a million times better lol\n\nI just don't get it, from the character choice to the actual casting itself. Mordecai and Brick are missing for no reason, replaced with Tiny Tina and Krieg. You can get away with Krieg, hell cast whoever you want as him, he wears a mask and yells obscenities. But Tina is meant to be like 8 god damn years old at this point and nothing to do with anything???\n\nKevin Hart as Roland. Enough fucking said. \n\nCate Blanchett and Jamie Lee Curtis as Lilith and Tannis respectively is fucking bizarre. Why on EARTH would you cast them THIS much older than their video game counterparts. Lilith's supposed to be this youthful badass and Tannis is while older, a 30-something little weirdo who happens to be on the autistic spectrum (something no doubt completely missing from her character.)\n\nEven Jack Black as Claptrap, now was this really fucking necessary? David Eddings or Jim Foronda would have been fine but we are absolutely set on casting JB as video game characters for some reason.\n\nI feel like Cate Blanchett was a spreadsheet decision because she was a single use actress in one of the higher grossing marvel movies that also took place in space and she also has lord of the rings nerd clout. In my mind, that's all there was to it.\n\nMy personal theory is Randy just wanted to meet these people.\n\nI honestly think it was a mistake to adapt any actual characters. The way that Twisted Metal and Fallout did it was great; some fun references but it's mostly the VIBE of the game that you're going for. \n\nIdk what Borderlands was trying to do\n\nBtw this movie cost $110-120 mil to make\n\nHalf of the money went to the cast and the other half in cocaine for the producers, the VFX guys got half a hotdog.\n\nAh, the Bungie budget: 4 mil for execs, 2.3 mil for Pete's cars, and $4 for game development\n\nTo promote the movie - Gearbox pushed a shitty cosmetics update for Borderlands 3, while not addressing things people in the community really wanted (FSR, DLSS, any modern upscaling really).\n\nTo be honest, I am not too sure if I really *want* bl4 after the..... Choices of BL3.\n\nI jokingly say they ruined Aurelia but matter of fact is: they changed some characters drastically, others got the chop entirely and some story threads didn't get picked up at all - like those from the Pre-Sequel. \n\nOther story elements were rushed to the extreme (Ava's story, we really don't need to talk about her again), others ended in a sudden unfulfilling end.\n\nAnd don't get me started on the million gun combos. What use are a million gun combos if only 20 *very* specific drops are good? Looter shooter as it may be, maybe dial down the amount or dial up the viability.\n\nI feel like these shit movies are for money laundering.\n\nBloodrayne 1-3 and House of the Dead. Classic money laundering movies for the mob.\n\nNo Brick, no Mordecai, no ticket.\n\nKevin was also a terrible choice for Roland. Like. Why?\n\nI can't fucking fathom it. I mean they idiotically made it PG-13 and he's basically the walking embodiment of that rating at this point. \n\nI wish fucking egotists could keep their meddling hands out of things for once. Roland is a serious role and is basically why Brick, or Mordecai should have absolutely been in the movie. Hell, cast Kevin Hart as Brick if you really want. Just... They fucked it so unconscionably bad.\n\nWhen the 2nd game gave the original quartet personalities, roland was legit the only straight man. His entire role was as the grounding, moral force for the other characters (and the missions of the games). Rolands death is like... the ONLY serious uniting event of the first 2 games and expansions for the other characters. The incredibly successful Tiny Tinas dnd game spin-off was contextually begun as Tinas coping mechanism for his demise!\n\n\nHiw do you make him the comedian?\n\nLol you really think the people that made this movie went this deep to make a decision? As far as I can tell, they saw a black character on the cover art and decided to cast Kevin Hart. That's about all the research they did.\n\nCouldn't cast the rock because there was no jungle\n\nDwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson is Sir Hammerlock in Sir Hammerlock's Big Game Hunt: The Movie\n\nRight? Youd think their \"algorithm\" wouldve said people would go crazy for a cute but deadly animal. Bloodwing would have been awesomed, i bet they cheaped out on the cgi bill.\n\nWhat algorithm, the single brain cell in most of the exec's heads struggling to figure out how best to not follow the source material and most efficiently disappoint the vast majority of people?\n\nOn the note of Mordecai and current olympics\n\nremember when Mordecai won sniper competition with revolver?\n\ni bet his pose was same as certain Turkish guy\n\nWhy Kevin Hart a comedian was cast as Roland one of the more serious characters in the game is beyond me\n\nThat and Jack black as claptrap. It's two very different kinds of humor... And their voices aren't even close.\n\nI really don't understand why they didn't use clap traps original va. It probably would have saved them money to.\n\nClaptrap was voiced by David Eddings in the first four Borderlands games,[4] but was replaced by Jim Foronda since Borderlands 2 VR following a public falling-out between Eddings and Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford.[4] Eddings claimed that he was offered sub-standard rates for voicing the character in Borderlands 3, and accused Pitchford of assault. Pitchford denied the claims, and called Eddings \"bitter and disgruntled\" after being fired from Gearbox.[5][6] From Wikipedia, even the games lost the VA for claptrap\n\nEverything I've ever heard about Randy Pitchford is that he sitting on his own shoulders. I wouldn't put \"sub-standard rates and [possible] assault\" beyond him.\n\nHe's currently losing his mind on Twitter as well, may be worth going and poking the bear just to see if he'll explode.\n\nEdit: typo\n\nAsk him about his lost thumb drive of porn at medieval times.\n\n\"She's not underage, she just looks like it\" - Randy's literal defense to what was found on the thumb drive.\n\nIts magic!\n\nWho has that stuff on a thumb drive? Or even carries that with them in the first place? It's like he was trying to get caught\n\nthe funny thing is, that was a defense for a guy years ago and it worked... because the porn star in question showed up at his trial when asked and showed she was in fact of age when she was doing the work. She was just insanely petite. Not defending Randy, he's an a-hole. Just amused by that random bit of porn trivia.\n\nI'm gonna guess that \"Sitting on his own shoulders\" is a sly and classier way of saying he has his head up his ass. \n\nI'mma have to start using that phrase.\n\nThe wild thing is he cares so fucking much about the Borderlands series so you'd think he'd put more effort into making the movie even palatable.\n\nLiterally attacking the writer of this article. I'm dying laughing knowing this is on front page of r/gaming now\n\nDidn't he also lose a flash drive full of hentai and project files at a convention or something?\n\nA flash drive with \"*teen squirt porn*\" and company files, and he left it at a Medieval Times restaurant.\n\nDude's a sack of shit for many reasons.\n\n[removed]\n\n[deleted]\n\nI haven't see the movie (ain't going to pay for it.), but the dumbest thing about using Jack Black as Cl4ptr4p in my opinion is that while Jack Black is great, even as a voice actor, because his voice is modulated to sound like a robot, it completely negates the point of having Jack Black in your movie, unless all you want is to be able to put his name on the poster.\n\nYou get Jack Black in person because of his mannerism and physicality and great skill, or you get him in a VA role because of his great recognizable voice.\n\n&gt; unless all you want is to be able to put his name on the poster.\n\nThat's probably the reason behind most of the casting choices.\n\nFilming started in 2021. I can only assume prior to this Kevin Hart’s career had reached the highest of heights from his standup to movies like Jumanji and Central Intelligence. Even Dave Chappelle joked in a recent special that his son desperately wanted to see Kevin Hart do standup.\n\nI’m guessing the producer/s just assumed he would automatically bring in the money.\n\nRandy Pitchford has shown over the last 5 years or so, he doesn't care about story.  He just wants celebrity cast around.  It was so cringe following Randy on Twitter and watching him post about hanging out with the cast.  I especially remember one that was a video of the two of them, and Kevin couldn't have possibly looked more disinterested.\n\nKevin Hart probably never even saw the finished movie. But Kevin Hart will see the vacation home he bought with the check from starring in a shitty movie every time he is there.\n\nwisely following in Michael Caine's footsteps\n\n\"I have never seen it [Jaws 4] but by all accounts it is terrible. However, I have seen the house that it built and it is terrific.\"\n\nAs a Counterpoint Dennis Hopper had this to say about Super Mario Brothers. “My 6-year-old son at the time... he said, ‘Dad, I think you’re probably a pretty good actor, but why did you play that terrible guy King Koopa in Super Mario Bros.?’ I said ‘Well Henry, I did that so you could have shoes.’ And he said, ‘Dad, I don’t need shoes that badly.’”\n\n“Daddy, Nick Cannon is hilarious”\n\nDave: Man, fuck you, son.\n\nIM BROKE!!!\n\nand Roland is also tall...should've cast Kevin Hart as Psycho Midget instead\n\nThat would have actually been funny. Just have Hart improvise being nuts and overdramatic the whole time and you pretty much end up with a typical Psycho.\n\nThe night I even learned there was a borderlands movie I was initially excited.then I saw the cast and all that excitement left. Kevin hart was an awful choice. As was all the others\n\nI’d have to guess most of that 8.8 million is YouTube reviewers and the family members of the cast.\n\nI for one am eagerly awaiting the \"I went to see Borderlands 12 days in a row\" video by Eddy Burback.\n\nHe would scour America to find dead malls where only a couple of stores are open and watch the movie in the theater there.\n\nI’m neither and saw it for the 0% RT hype\n\nI found a t-shirt specifically for the movie ... at Goodwill TODAY.\n\nThis should be made into an official way of measuring a fiasco. Time To Goodwill.\n\nThe lower the days, the worse the product is.\n\nWe already have the bulk donation to African NGOs timeline\n\nNot just general borderlands stuff but something for the movie only?\n\nMovie specifically. It says \"BORDERLANDS\" (big letters) and \"the movie\" (small letters, like they already knew no one wanted a Borderlands the Movie t-shirt). The back says Mountain Dew and a theater chain.\n\nIt has ClapTrap on the front.\n\nEDIT: Sorry, says \"in theaters August 9\", not \"the movie\". But clearly it's for the movie.\n\nI'd like to think someone said \"well we made too many of these give them to the poors.\"  \n\nBut then the poor people said \"We don't fucking want this\" and just gave it to goodwill.\n\nCan't shit on the source material that is dear to your core audience and then complain when your core audience doesn't show up.\n\nOnly a 9% favorable rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Oof\n\nThat 9% is from people who liked certain actors in the film. That's it.\n\nYeah lol I actually looked through them yesterday when it was at lower than 9% and there was only one out of 36 reviews positive. \n\nThe review basically said I love Kate Blanchet, Kate Blanchet fans will like this movie cause she is in it.\n\nI’m a Cate Blanchett fan, but sadly I’m also a Borderlands fan and, even more importantly, someone who prefers movies to not suck.\n\nSaw Kevin Hart as Rolan and was a complete nope from me.\n\nFor me, it was Cate Blanchett as Lilith. WTF thought of that? Nothing in common. She was my favorite character. Just another big name. \nOverall, though, with video game adaptations, it’d be nice to have people who actually played the games and had passion for games. You can’t tell me that, in all of Hollywood, there were more suitable choices, even if “unknown.”\nHeaven forbid they learn of Elden Ring…\n\nYeah, especially after having played the Borderlands games, it was really hard for me to get on board with having Lilith – a badass in her early 20s played by 55-year old Cate Blanchett\n\nJust got back from a showing and I gotta say, her vibe was way closer to Lilith's than Kevin's was to Roland.. that Roland casting may have genuinely been the worst I have ever seen in any movie\n\nIf it's as unfunny as the trailers suggest, can you imagine the amount of fake laughter that must have occurred during the table reads?\n\nI think there was one possible chuckle in the cinema when I saw it on Saturday. And based on what I was seeing on screen, I'm assuming it was a sympathy chuckle.\n\nIt might also have been someone trying to suppress a cough.\n\nThey made the movie for everyone except those who played the games.\n\nApparently they made the movie for no one.\n\nYeah, seems like all the game fans are pissed. Meanwhile, I have zero familiarity with the game so it just looked like a boring attempt at an R rated Guardians of the Galaxy.\n\n&gt;  like a boring attempt at an R rated Guardians of the Galaxy.\n\nProbably because they took an IP known for over the top comedic violence (the first game was a raider blowing his own brains out with finger guns) and made it PG-13\n\n[deleted]\n\nExcept it's pg-13\n\nOh, that is delightfully tragic.\n\nExec: Guys, I have a great idea! Let’s use this super popular video game IP to make a movie!\n\nProducer: Thats a great idea, we can follow a well known and loved story and adapt it to the big screen!\n\nExec: Follow the story?\n\n“It had a story?”\n\n“I thought it would write and pay for itself!”\n\n\"We put Kevin Hart in it, what more do they want?\"\n\nWhat in the fuck were they thinking.\n\nSame thing as the Halo TV people.\n\n\"Here's a franchise with a well defined universe and countless fun stories that can be adapted.  Let's throw out everything, cherry pick a few characters and names, and make our own thing\"\n\nMortal Kombat movie. Tons of lore and an abundance of great characters. But no. Let’s add a terrible new character that’s the equivalent of a boiled, unseasoned chicken breast.\n\nThere's only 70+ fighters on the roster, obviously they had to invent a new one and make him as interesting as paint drying.\n\nJohnny Cage could have narratively filled the role of audience stand in very easily, minus the relationship with scorpion part but they probably could have figured that out.\n\n(i will admit the last fight in the frozen cage was the coolest part of the movie)\n\nNot making the main character Takeda was not even a missed opportunity. It was just downright IP negligence by the writers and producers.\n\nNo. Earlier. \n\nEven further back. \n\nThis has been a problem since the very beginning, the curse laid upon video game movies. \n\nThe live-action Super Mario Bros movie. \n\nAnd you see *so many* of the issues that plague many video game movies. A lack of faithfulness to the source, an unrecognizable story, only the paltry figleaf of character names and designs, the director doing what *they* want rather than trying to figure out what the *fans* want. \n\nAll right there.\n\nYes, but that movie was at least an entertaining spectacle and \"Video game lore\" in 1993 when Super Mario Bros. came out is almost an oxymoron, so it was forgivable.\n\nThat was an era where Nintendo would do stuff like release the second game in the series as a completely different genre or a texture swapped game from a different IP.\n\n&gt; The live-action Super Mario Bros movie. \n\nI watched that in Theaters.\n\nEven as a 5 year old that was incredibly confusing and disappointing.\n\nFind bandits, shoot them in the faces repeat.\n\nExec: We wanted Kevin Hart to be the strong soldier character.\n\nNothing against Kevin but man that casting choice makes no sense\n\nkevin hart always plays the same \"small man trying to prove something\" character. cuz thats who he is. whereas Roland is more of a stoic, cuz he's seen some shit.\n\nCould’ve casted Idris Elba or the US president from the show 24. I’m honestly surprised they didn’t cast Mark Wahlberg as Roland.\n\nIdris Elba has already played Roland, and that did not go well.\n\nIronically, he was without a doubt the best part of that movie. \n\nAnd it's an absolute crime we will never get a proper story with him as Roland, as he was a fantastic casting choice for it.\n\nAlso Jack Black, nothing aginst him, but there was zero reason not to use the correct voice actor for Claptrap\n\nyes there was. his voice actor [wanted to be paid](https://x.com/davideddings/status/1123970727395373057) or some bullshit, and like fuck that amirite\n\nWould love to see the audition footage.\n\nKevin: \"Hi i'm kevi-\"\n\nExec.: \"HIRED!\"\n\nPretty sure there’s no audition. When you get an A lister, you know what you’re getting.\n\nAs soon as he was announced as Roland I knew this movie would be shit. No hate to Kevin Hart but this was never going to work.\n\nLiterally the same conversation the producers should have had regarding Netflix's \"The Witcher,\" now all that's left is for them to come out and blame the public and there you have it, guys.\n\nHenry Cavill at least fit the role well. He tried to push the writing to be more like the games and novels and got fired because of it. \n\nAll the actors in this movie look like they a group Halloween costume gone awry\n\nI don't think he was fired.  He quit, didn't he?\n\nIt was a bit of both. He gave them an ultimatum and they didn't budge, so he quit.\n\nHe quit and now he's working on a warhammer 40K show where he had control over the production. Man wants a good adaption.\n\n\"We'll at least have good representations of the characters people know and love, right?\"\n\n\n\"... Right??\"\n\nI mean I think they also missed Borderlands peak.\nBorderlands 2 was when it felt like it was at its peak in popularity, 3 although not a bad game definitely didn't feel as widely popular as 2.\n\nHell I'd regularly have friends force me into another Borderlands 2 playthrough just because.... never did more than one Borderlands 3 playthrough co-op...\nIf I mention the word borderlands in certain chats I know il get coerced into another Borderlands 2 playthrough.\n\nYour comment could be used to describe the Halo TV show with zero changes required\n\n\nHow are TV/film executives this bad at their jobs\n\nWatch the recent Vince Vaughan interview on Hot Ones. He is surprisingly candid and basically says nobody can even get a meeting in Hollywood these days unless they already have an IP attached to their movie. Borderlands is going to be a loser that is swept under the rug, but the wind was already blowing this was and Barbie changed things foreve r\n\nMatt Damon also said something similar on hot ones. Basically saying that since DVD is a dead format and streaming is king, Hollywood no longer wants to take risks because they can only make money on the theatrical release without the extra sales from DVDs. He went on to say that he's kinda bummed about it as his favorite movies are ones that took chances on original stories with interesting characters\n\nExcept they are taking risks, just bad ones.\n\n\n\"We have IP with a known story. We know that story and the characters are well liked and we have a guaranteed audience.\"\n\n\n\"Ok let's change everything because Hollywood writers have large egos. Surely that will sell better.\"\n\nCrazy thing is borderlands has known plot writing deficiencies. It could’ve used a touch up and had space to inject a few new ideas. Instead they blew the whole thing up\n\n\"The thing we were doing isn't working anymore!?\"\n\nPeople with a scrap of pride in their work: \"Improvise, adapt, overcome!\"\n\nHollywood execs: *cower in their financial comfort zone*\n\nQuarterly growth at all costs coupled with the \"what have you done for us today\" mentality equals \"entertainment by statistical analysis\".\n\nI wouldn't even call the IP particularly popular. It's certainly not popular enough to draw a non-gamer audience like, for instance, Mario would.\n\nThey looked at Halo’s TV series and went “hmm yes. Look how upset their fan base is. Let’s do exactly what they did!”\n\nI truly don’t understand how this keeps happening. How many video game movies/shows have flopped at this point just because of unnecessary modifications of the story or characters. We’ve seen with The Last of Us that if you keep it mostly on script you’ll be successful yet it hasn’t occurred elsewhere yet.\n\nThey've got additional example of Fallout and Arcane (though Arcane doesn't quite have a story that shows up in the games, they still nailed it). You could toss Castlevania in there as well (although apparently some people find issue with the later seasons? Still a fun time nonetheless) \n\nBooks, video games, and comics all suffer the same treatment when moving to movies/TV it seems like.\n\nDoes cyberpunk edgerunners count ? I feel like the studio understood the world and lore and made an amazing story.\n\nEdgerunners definitely counts, they brought that world to life almost better than the game does honestly\n\n&gt; We’ve seen with The Last of Us that if you keep it mostly on script you’ll be successful yet it hasn’t occurred elsewhere yet.\n\nFunnily enough, Craig Mazin also wrote the original screenplay for The Last of Us *and* Borderlands. According to those that have read it, it is actually a pretty good script. After Roth started messing with it, it was so bad Mazin sued to have his name removed from it.\n\nEli Roth ruining a movie?! Surely not. I'm convinced the only reason he's still getting gigs is because the Bear Jew is one of the best characters of all time.\n\nFallout too, that was a brilliant season.\n\nFallout also did well creating a new story in the universe yet keeping the same tone the games set. It did enough to reference the games for fans without alienating the general audience and should really set the bar going forward.\n\nI appreciated the amount of times a situation in the show I could picture happening in the game with the HUD and everything.\n\n\"Thou shall get sidetracked by bullshit every goddamn time\" resonated with basically everyone hard.\n\n[deleted]\n\nIt probably depends on the type of game. Fallout is an open world whereas The Last of Us is very linear and easier to turn into a show directly. I think Fallout New Vegas would be the most appealing for following the main story as much as possible but it still loses a lot of its charm.\n\nBethesda also apparently had a lot of sway in the development of the show, I believe Todd Howard said they thought of it internally as “we’re making Fallout 5 but a TV show.”\n\nSilent Hill too.\n\nTomb Raider, Resident Evil and Street Fighter were less faithful but plenty succesfull and entertaining in their own ways.\n\nI'm gonna toss Twisted Metal on that heap as well. They took an IP  that fell of the game market years ago. The stories for the games followed different directions over the years as the sequels/reboots came along. The show managed to take elements from all of them and tie them into a single story. They kept plenty of fan service while making a fun car combat show that no one else was doing. I can't wait for season 2.\n\nSheer fucking hubris is why.\n\nCan’t wait for metal gear solid, staring the rock as solid snake and Kevin hart as otocon.\n\nI know it's a simple answer, but I think it's arrogant writers / wrong writers for the job.\n\n\nI think a lot of writers don't like the source material, but still take the work. They want to write their own story, and then sloppily try to adapt it to the setting in a way that doesn't fit.\n\n\nYou need writers that respect the source material and want to adapt it to the medium, not throw it out and make their own shit.\n\nThing is, you can just take a few concepts from an established game IP and then do your own thing with it while respecting the spirit and lore of the game. Fallout did it very well. And sticking to the story from the games also works if you do it well. See The Last Of Us.\n\nThis project was doomed from the start, because the people involved didn't actually care about the Borderlands games.\n\nThe moment I saw Kevin Hart was Roland, I knew the movie would be trash. Kevin Hart is as opposite of Roland as you can get.\n\nWait... the poster above wasn't joking about that?!?\n\nOh yeah, no, Hart is actually Roland.\n\nLol no, this is just a bad movie for everyone\n\nAs someone who hasn’t played the games, it was not for me either.\n\nCan't say I'm surprised.\n\nCasting Kevin Hart and Kate Blanchett was strike one and two for me, then announcing a pg-13 rating was strike three. No regrets not seeing it.\n\nThis feels like a movie where you could get some no-name actors to keep costs down, it's not like people are expecting deep acting from a borderlands movie.\n\nTotally agree. No names, no attached expectations.\n\nThat's 8.8 million more than I would have expected.\n\nChalk it up to [Bile Fascination.](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BileFascination)\n\nI genuinely had no clue the movie was releasing/released until I started seeing reddit posts. Never saw any advertising which means the studio didn’t have any faith either.\n\nI saw a trailer in cinema while waiting for Deadpool &amp; W. Immediately thought that it'd be a shitty movie. They struggled hard to find scenes for the trailer\n\nIf a studio can’t make a trailer fun or cohesive, it’s usually a dud movie\n\nIGN had previews for months but it’s clear this studio knew this movie was going to bomb. They had almost no marketing.\n\nMaybe it’s your age demographic. I saw ads for this literally everywhere. My younger sister kept getting spammed on TikTok with borderlands ads and she even asked me “hey isn’t this that game you play.”\n\nThe actors were all old, and trying to market to younger audience, not gonna work \n\nOld is certainly one of the issues. Poor casting is the main one. Kevin heart as Roland? Blanchett as Lilith? I didn't even recognize Tina's character at all at first and wondered who she was supposed to be. And I love Jack Black but that wasn't a clap trap voice at all.\n\nSomebody called Borderlands this generation’s The Adventures of Pluto Nash, and I think that’s apt.\n\n💀. Call the coroner. Lionsgate is requesting an autopsy.\n\n[deleted]\n\nHad to scroll down very far to see this, it's Boomerlands not Borderlands\n\nComing up next:\n\n\nStellar blade,  starring Meryl Streep in the lead role.\n\nWill and Jaden as Kratos and Atreus.\n\nGood. In a free market, bad products should fail, and that should trigger corrective measures in the companies that release bad products from doing the same stupid shit again.\n\nI mean, I got half way through the trailer and realized that the entire movie was a miscast trainwreck cashing in on the \"edgy\" humor of tiny tina and the irritation of claptrap and little else.\n\nBorderlands isn't exactly the most compelling story, as a game. As an overall franchise, it does get better. I would argue that Handsome Jack's portrayal as a witty psychopath antagonist in 2 is the highlight of the series. So it absolutely bewilders me, but doesn't surprise me, that Hollywood cheaped out on hiring good screen writers to do a better adaptation of the whole story instead of the \"hurr durr vault hunters opening a vault\", because honestly, that's not interesting. That's barely a plot for a 30 minute TV show, let alone a stand alone movie.\n\nBut some Hollywood jackass saw an IP and ran with it. Running it into the ground. This kills any chance of seeing Handsome Jack on film, which is a shame.\n\nI level the same criticisms at this movie as I did at Forespoken, having only seen promotional materials. Okay premise, boring story, unlikable characters, pretty but wasted graphics. Forgettable, and tbh, not worth the time when better alternatives exist.\n\nTbf, Tales from the Borderlands was fantastic and shows that you could 100% use the borderlands setting to tell an awesome story.\n\nbut that would require somebody to give a fuck\n\nThey should have hired Anthony Burch. out of the series, 2 I felt was the best\n\nProbably my favorite telltale game. If they would have just made a movie of that story I'd definitely watch it!\n\nThe problem is that we’re then relying on executives that greenlit the wrong portrayal to learn the right lesson. \n\nWill the people involved in making this movie think “we should make sure the story follows the spirit of the game and caters to its fans” or “we shouldn’t make movies with videogame IP”?\n\nWell, we've been on a pretty good run of video game adaptations lately with things like Fallout and The Last of Us. This absolute failure should remind everyone involved what video game movies used to be compared to what they are now. Milking an IP for as much money as you can is over. There is too much media these days, and fandoms are far more critical.\n\nThe message here should be: do it right, or don't do it at all.\n\nHi guys. 0 experience in movies here.\n\nImo this movie should have been.\n\n5mins of intros followed by an 80-minute John wick sequence where they constantly get different guns\n\nRoll credits\n\nThis legitimately wouldve been a better movie. Have them pull increasingly ridiculous Wacky Races ahh guns out of random cabinets, chests, toilets. Stay true to the absurdity of the games, embrace the ridiculousness. \n\nAlso dont cast Jamie Lee Curtis or Kevin Hart for this they are completely misplaced in their roles but hey what do I knoe.\n\nLet's not forget the miscasting of Cate Blanchett as the bad-arse siren, Lilith. Cate is 55 years old and best known as Galadriel, a graceful and stately elf.\n\nThis was the casting decision that bugged me the most, why did they get a 55 year old to play a 22 year old character?\n\nand why is the story about  her mom?\n\nplayed by Haley Bennett, who's 36\n\nCommon Randy Pitchford L\n\nHe's raking in the L's on Twitter recently lol\n\nI saw the casting when it came out a few months ago and knew straight away this was gonna suck. Like why not get the original claptrap VA at least\n\nRandy physically fought the original VA and I think he wants to disassociate from the franchise.\n\nI saw the trailer once and was like, \"Who casted these people for this? It's never going to work!\"\n\nGuess it really didn't work.\n\nI gave up on this film when the casting was announced before they’d filmed a single shot.\n\nWhat’s so hard with sticking to source material \n\nBorderlands 2 had a cool story with one of the best  villains of all time. Just take something from there and/or expand it from there\n\n&gt; What’s so hard with sticking to source material\n\nHollywood executives still seem to struggle with this. Idk why\n\nI'm surprised it made over 5mil, I attribute that to morbid curiosity.\n\nThe casting sucked, and it didn't have the charm of the games.\n\nGet Ashley Burch to play tiny Tina herself, someone stoic for Roland instead of Kevin Hart.\n\nDo cell shading clothing and effects, it would be great aesthetically speaking.\n\nI'm just so sick and tired of these studios trying to play it safe with big name actors when they could really find someone who fits the role and brings it to life instead of shoehorning in all the big names they can.\n\nBurch is 34.  No dig on her personally, but there's gotta be late teen/early twenties actress who can bring the energy of Tina to the screen without being 2 decades older than the character.\n\nI mean, it'd be on par with as Cate Blanchett as Lilith.\n\nI'm just thinking Batista would be a good Brick?\n\nHopefully this will be the final nail in the coffin of bad adaptation of video games. When you show respect to the source material, the content is good. \n\nThe Last Of Us  \nFallout  \nSonic (to an extent) \n\nWhen you don't care for the source material, you get shite like\n\nBorderlands  \nHalo \n\nRespect the source material, respect the fans, show some love, and the movie / show will do well.\n\nIt's Randy Pitchford, he thinks he is untouchable and can make everything fail knowing the golden parachute is there for him\n\nWe are all tired of kevin hart and the rock in everything!\n\nWatched it and the first five minutes will lose you. Not that I was expecting this to be great but the pacing and editing is all over the place. It's 80mins long with absolutely zero focus on the guns and it's world. All the main actors are to old for the roles they are supporting.  \n\n\nI'm betting they take it out of theaters and release it digital within 2-3 weeks.\n\nThe first game has the PERFECT way to intro the movie, already laid out. They just had to do that. slamming song, over-the-top introduction to the characters, and a feel for the awful environment that is Pandora. They even give us *a* bus sequence, but no cage the elephant or anything interesting."

    "all_comment_text": "Damn that’s literally a hardware bug\n\nRight!?\n\nFun fact, that’s literally how we came to use the term “bug.” The first known computer “bug” was a moth that caused issues in a computer system way back in 1947.\n\nMothman strikes again.\n\nJust when he randomly popped in my thoughts.\n\ni mean that's how mothman works\n\nHe's thinking of you too\n\nHe‘s stinking of you\n\nHe's drinking to you\n\nHe's just trying to warn you of the bridge.\n\nMind the red eyes!\n\nThe Bridge!\n\nThe bridge..\n\nRiiise from your grave\n\nHow the fuck did so many LPOTL fans show up in the same thread?! Anywho, hail yourselves!\n\nHail you! It's the Internet. We are many and we lurk.\n\nHe’s always striking, he never left.\n\nYou mean MothBoy\n\nThat’s not true. We have books that use the term bug in the same way as we do now that predate computes by almost 100 years.\n\nDamnit. I thought that was where that originated from\n\nWhile the term goes back quite a bit further Grace Hopper did find a moth burned to death from a short in the Harvard Mark I.  She taped it into her log and wrote, [\"First actual case of bug being found\"](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:First_Computer_Bug,_1945.jpg)\n\nHenceforth the story was conflated with the origin of the term\n\nMy favorite part of this is that the \"First actual case of bug being found\" is always included in the story, even though the joking comment makes ***zero sense*** if this is where the term bug came from.\n\nRight! You don't need to refer to wikipedia or some fact checking website to disprove the claim.  You also don't need to be some tech savy guy to explain that it makes zero sense, you just need some basic listening skills to understand that this claim actually shows the term should have already existed.\n\nActually it's an old word that originally comes from Welsh, and originally means something along the lines of 'something creepy or scary', such as a ghost, monster, goblin, etc. It only later came to mean 'insect' after first being applied to 'bedbugs', which are in fact both creepy and scary.\n\nThe use of the word to mean a unexpected or erroneous behavior of mechanical or technological systems started in the 19th century, long before the dead moth story, and comes from the creepy/scary/ghost meaning, not the insect meaning.\n\nHence why the D&amp;D monster \"bugbear\" is not a giant tardigrade or any other insect.\n\nYup I think it was Divinci or someone.  Though the term Debugging did come from the moth incident.\n\nThis one was taped to the system operator log book. The moth had interrupted a single electromechanical relay in a critical section of the logic circuits and stopped up the whole thing.\n\nI think just about every single computer science course out there attributes that moth as the first recorded \"debugging\" of a computer system. \n\nIt's a fun dad joke of a story anyways.\n\nOn the very first day of my first Comp Sci class our professor asked ,rhetorically, if anyone knew where the term came from so I gave the classic answer.\n\nHe looked at me like I had eaten his lunch.\n\nSo the fact that he was pissed, but still wrong, makes it better in my min.\n\nThat’s not true. We have computers that eat books in the same way we now do that predate moths by almost 100 years.\n\nThat’s not true. We have moths that eat computers in the same way we now do that predate books by almost 100 years.\n\nWhile I agree it's not true, punch cards have been a thing in some form since 1725.  A bug certainly has the potential to mess up a hole in paper tape on a loom as much as it could screw up some opcode on an early computer.\n\nWas this myth debunked? Pretty sure that's not actually true\n\nIts half true. The word “bug” to mean defect is old, but the verb “debugging” comes from the moth incident\n\nThat computer scientist's name? Grace Hopper.\n\nIt was a moth, not a grasshopper.\n\n\nI'll see myself out.\n\nGoddamnit I thought it was lol\n\nThe anecdote is kind of true (they did find a moth and tape it up with the caption \"first actual bug found in computer\") but it was noteworthy/funny because we were *already* using 'bug' as a term to mean flaws/glitches in the system. However, that incident (of finding a real bug) did happen and may have inspired the term \"debugging\".\n\nWhen I was buying fallout new Vegas at GameStop the cashier said watch out for the bugs! And then I encountered giant roaches in a schoolhouse and thought “thanks for the warning”\n\nI believe said moth ended up taped in a log book\n\nAll bugs should be logged\n\nNext the web will have been coined after webs inside a server.\n\nThe term \"bug\" was in use long before computers existed.\n\nIt just referred to actual bugs that would cause failures in all the wood and rope based stuff in common use at the time. Thry caused unexpected problem in a computer's hardware or software that causes it to behave incorrectly or produce unexpected results\n\nIMO, battle equipment like catapults, bows and balista are probably the most likely source of it becomming a general term for an unexpected problem or defect that causes something to operate incorrectly. Although it could have been bridges or any other structures or equipment that operate under heavy loads and be prone to catastropic failure.\n\nLosing soldiers and sons due to termites and ants would create a strong emotional base for the word to circulate among the upper castes. \"My sons weren't killed by the enemy. They were killed by a damned bug!\"\n\nIt could have originated in any number of ways as bugs have been a deadly enemy to us humans and the things we need throught our existence, despite us being able to easily squish them with a finger.\n\nFun fact that’s actually a myth. The term “bug” comes from telegraphy in the 1800s. Meaningless chatter from inexperienced operators sounded like a bug noise and the term caught on from there to describe the bad operators as bugs in the system. Way later it was ascribed to computing.\n\nIsn't this a myth?\n\nThis is actually not true, Hopper popularized it in software, but bug has been traced all the way back to Thomas Edison for defects\n\nThis has been debunked. Stop the misinformation\n\nLies\n\nThe first known computer bug comes from when \"computer\" was an occupation, literally \"one who computes\", when a particularly contagious infestation of pubic lice swept through the Royal Greenwich Observatory in 1753. Months of computations had to be discarded due to all the errors caused by the teams of computers constantly scratching themselves, distracting them from catching what should have been obvious mistakes in their figures\n\nIt was a nice attempt, but you didn’t mention the fact that in 1998, The Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell In A Cell, and plummeted 16 ft through an announcer's table.\n\nIdk maybe it's a spooky ghost\n\nI too am leaning more towards spooky ghost.\n\nIf you press the screen hard enough it may become a software bug.\n\nI mean this exact situation is where the phrase \"debug\" came from. Pretty low hanging fruit.\n\nI had a bug crawling under the screen of my SP when I was a kid. Kid me though I could get rid of it by pressing on the screen... That made a lot of \"dead\" pixels\n\nHahaha\n\nMy sister brought me her laptop to work on one time because it was busted. Opened it up and probably 20-30 baby centipedes came crawling out. \n\nI said NOPE, not me! Find someone else or throw it away.\n\nNightmare Fuel\n\nAnd one dead bug xD\n\nturn it off and cover up the screen so no light can get in, he should then find his own way out. This worked when I had a bug inside my TV screen.\n\nAlso put it near a lamp so he tries to go to the light outside the screen\n\nI love … lamp\n\nThen when he notices the lamp he will wake up from his head injury induced fantasy life, and our world will cease to exist.\n\nI gotta upvote this, because I was so busy trying to think of active solutions, that I forgot to think of a passive one. Good on ya.\n\nI used to get bugs crawling into my PC monitors all the time and it was annoying as hell because they'd die right in the middle and be super noticeable, so every time I noticed one alive in there I'd open a completely dark window, and then use a bright white window to lead the little bugger to a corner at which point I'd push hard on the screen to squish it. Still annoying, but at least not in the middle of my screen.\n\nFor how long he managed to survive there lol\n\nI’ve got no clue. I’m just hoping he dies off screen otherwise corpse removal is going to be a nightmare. Lol.\n\nI don't think that they would show live death on a Nintendo game, so I would also hope that he dies off screen. Otherwise, the game wouldn't be rated E\n\nHahaha\n\nIdk. I spent an entire day killing Mario in different ways in Supe Mario 64 for the ds.\n\nMario doesn't die, he exits stage down.\n\n&gt; so I would also hope that he dies off screen.\n\n\n\n\n\nCalm down, Gege Akutami.\n\nThere's a dead bug in my TV. It happened like 6 months after I got it, and I was so pissed. Realistically, I don't notice it from across the room, but I *know* the bastard's corpse is in there lol\n\nMan, I hate to be the one to break this to you, but there are dead bugs in, like, *all* your things.\n\nShhhh if I can't see them they don't exist.\n\nBut no I'm fully aware. In my last apartment, I had a fungus gnat war that lasted the better part of a year. I don't mind bugs, I just don't want them in my screens!\n\nDo you know how many bugs are dead in just your eyebrows?  So gross.\n\nHappened to my monitor and I was equally furious. It’s still there ten years later which makes me wonder why it hasn’t decomposed. Is it just mummified in there? I tried guiding it out with my hand by tapping on the screen but I pressed too hard and killed it.\n\nTry a suction cup then tapping to get it to fall, worked tor me.\n\nThat happened to me too, also about 6 months after I got it!\n\nI forget about it, but then I remember it and can't stop seeing it.\n\nIf it does die in the screen, you can use an electric toothbrush to vibrate the screen so that the corpse at least falls into the edge off-screen.\n\nThat’s not a bad line of thinking. I’ll be sure to keep it in mind. Cheers mate.\n\nI had this happen with one of my PC monitors once. They did not die off screen. Removal was indeed a nightmare. Fingers crossed for you!\n\nWhenever I see them atop the screen I already get frightened. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAlso, you're looking at your smartphone screen and suddenly a dust speck starts moving.\n\nNot visible in the screen but... My monitor started going out from bad caps, so I popped it open to replace them. The insides were *filled* with ants, all of them long since dead and slow roasted for months or maybe even years.\n\n*So... So many ants.*\n\nBut if he dies off screen he's gonna respawn immediately\n\n*Rosencrantz and Guildenstern have entered the chat*\n\nYou can see a dead fruit fly on the top left of my TV. Doesn't block any pixels when I'm sitting back at the couch but I know the fucker is there.\n\nSomeone call Gege\n\nWas scrolling for this lmao\n\nHappened to my new monitor when I was 16. Tried to get it out by scaring it with my hand and it died. It’s still there ten years later and it looks ugly as hell. Fucking hate that bug.\n\nEw… how the hell did a bug get inside? This is like my worse nightmare.\n\nSome type of bugs love electronics and are small enough to crawl in. That's why you have to keep them clean and keep them in a safe spot.\n\nFunny thing is my Gameboy is in a good spot. It’s got its own zipper case, and it’s in a dresser drawer off the ground. So idk what’s going on. Still gives me the willies tho.\n\nDrawers are actually full of them (knock kn wood). put a paper there and see what happens. If they are the kind that loves paper it will attract them and it is easy to spot on white paper.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThanks to mold and them I tend to package stuff inside bags that I then close.\n\nI think I'd prefer to live in ignorance.\n\nWhat a bad day to be literate\n\nI remember my dad told me that he went into the room with the hot tub in and turned the light on. There were hundreds and hundreds of worm things crawling around the surface of the floor which was still mud because it hadn’t been finished yet. They were writhing around for a split second, then they suddenly burrowed back into the ground and were gone. I heard another story about it happening with cockroaches in someone’s bathroom. They were in the bathroom in the dead of night and turned the light on to see hundreds of cockroaches scurrying away into the walls.\n\nso your drawers are full of mold and bugs... and your conclusion is \"that's perfectly normal, better vacuumseal that printer paper *and* educate the internet about it\"?\n\nNuh uh.\n\nBirth of the first living electronics parasite. You've got patient zero for the destruction of modern technology as we know it. Keep him safe. If ever we experience an AI/Robot uprising. We'll need them.\n\nIf it can fit between two layers of a screen assembly, I wouldn't be surprised if it can fit in-between teeth of a regular (non-waterproofed) zipper.\n\nDo you have birds nesting near your home? I've had experience with bird mites...they thrive in bird nests or dead birds, an apartment I was at had them above the awning on the 2nd floor. They love electronics and are teeny tiny\n\nAs a matter of fact yes. 2nd floor for me as well. Approx 6ft away is a window that is open 24/7 and approx 6ft higher than that is a rain gutter that the birds love to make new nests in every spring. There’s a new family with babies up there now and I hear them each morning.\n\nComputer repair guy I knew once told me about the time he opened a PC tower and found it was *crawling* with roaches, which is a nightmare to me.\n\nAlso once found peanut butter inside a laptop which he said was the most confusing one he ever had to deal with.\n\nMy current job is repairing video game consoles. Our shop has a perpetual roach problem because people are fucking *disgusting*. We put infested units in the freezer to make them stop crawling around and then we do a full teardown with a vacuum to suck up the corpses. \n\nOne time, I opened the hard drive cover on a PS4 Slim and they spilled out with the dust and flakes of their waste falling out like sand through a doorway in a mummy movie or some shit. Shit legit keeps me up at night sometimes.\n\nReminds me of the prank video where they filled the pc with beans lmao\n\nThat video is fucking hilarious!\n\n“No…it’s BEANS!”\n\nIt's probably a springtail. Those fuckers are tiny and goddamned everywhere dark and cool.\n\nThe same thing happened to my tv, with ants. They chose to die in the DEAD CENTER of the screen. I eventually had to get a new one, since it was too distracting having ants on top of every game.\n\nBuilt in crosshair lmao\n\nI actually had a red dead pixel on a second hand monitor  northeast, close to the middle at the right corner.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIt would sometimes disappear depending on the content or turn black (which was then a non issue).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nEventually mold spread across the screen like a Petri dish though. Horror scene.\n\nWhen there is an actual bug in the game\n\nDust mite.  Same thing happened to my GBA after letting it sit for a while.\n\nSolution?\n\nThe best solution is to have the monitor turned off and have a warm flashlight on the side of the monitor to try to guide the bug outside\n\nUnless they entered while they were smaller and then grew too big to ~~exist~~ exit\n\nThe typo made me lol\n\n[removed]\n\nWait, really?\n\nBugs like that are drawn to the warmth and light which is why they’re attracted to the screen.\n\nI didn't have tools to take it apart at the time, so he ended up dying in there.\n\nI keep the stuff that is outside the box with me and in movement. Seems to be the only prevention.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI'd seem them almost every day on the mouse and going out and about on the mousepad.\n\nYou're a terrible father\n\nIt's what lead me to start drinking\n\nBuddy is in a different dimension\n\nFor real\n\nMy time to shine!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIt's \"booklice\" or even smaller similar.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nPsocids\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nGoogle actually gave me Psocoptera. That's a new one to me.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAnyway, be happy it didn't die or it would become a \"stuck pixel\". I have one dead inside the selfie camera of a Zenfone 5 (or inside the led, I can't remember).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThey love humidity and can actually infest a place. I should have taken photos of the dynamic \"pixels\" on the wall.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThey're harmless though. Will get EVERYWHERE though.\n\nKILL IT BURN IT WITH FIIIIIREEEE\n\nNo, avoid burn in!\n\nCould be a thrips, they like getting into screens. I have two in my monitor right now.\n\nTurn it off and set it near a lamp you've turned on, preferably a bright bulb. Dude will find his way out again\n\nWhere was this gameboy when I first saw them. I have seen those in the wild too!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nNot knowing what they were was driving me crazy. They just appeared one day.\n\nBug in the system\n\nIt's an undead pixel\n\nThese days that bug would get patched with an update, but back then ya had to just live with it.\n\nidk i think your gameboy is just buggin\n\nThat, my friend, is neither a Pixel nor dead.\n\nWhoa....is that bug paying rent?\n\nimagine you are the bug, it's going to be so trippy like you are walking on the surface of the sun but it's colours\n\nZombie pixel!\n\nLiving pixel\n\nIt is literally bugged\n\nWhatever you do, DO NOT SQUISH IT.\n\nHappened to me with my pc monitor. Multiple ants. At first squishing it worked since the bodies fell to the bottom of the monitor, not blocking the screen.\n\nUntil it stopped working.\n\nHad to live with a lot of \"dead pixels\" for a few years until I could buy a new monitor.\n\n\nAs to why I squished them at all, them constantly moving drove me insane.\n\ndid you report the bug?\n\nTrying to escape the matrix\n\nAnybody yet say tardigrade?\n\nIt was a boiling hot summers day. Was having an small LAN party with friends in my parents house. This was the olden days so our screens were these massive CRT Monitors. As we are casually chatting this massive fly lands on one of the monitors and for whatever reasons it decided to crawl into one of the many holes in the top of the monitor. A moment later we hear a bzt and a small plume of smoke escaped the still functioning CRT.\n\nMost of the time i hate it when characters die off screen. This is not one of those times.\n\nBro found a real bug\n\nI had a tiny bug like that in a computer monitor when I was a kid. Watched the thing crawl to the centre of the screen and fucking die there and I got to stare at it for years\n\nI laughed way to hard\n\n\"This is why you always burn the bodies!\"\n\nJust going on vacation\n\nive a dead bug in my 2nd monitor which blocks out a few pixels. I've tried everything to shift it but no fix, I just accept it and his fate now.\n\nReminds me of the scene in The Ring where the fly in the video suddenly becomes real and she plucks it off the screen.\n\nOne way too organic led.\n\nReminds me of the time I bought an Atari 7800 at the flea market only to bring it home and find it doesn't work so I open it up and find about seven dead cockroaches the size of my thumb. I'll never know if I could've gotten it working or not because it went in the dumpster faster than JoJo Siwa's sensibilities after getting out from under her mother's thumb\n\nYour system has a bug\n\nNow see in the industry we refer to that as the O part of OLED.\n\nPoor thing has fleas\n\nWell, RIP to that little guy.\n\nI noticed an ant crawling across my TV once, tried to get it off and realized it was on the inside... I pressed on the screen enough to create pressure and it ran the other direction never to be seen again but theres probably still something in there, I bet its fairly common with electronics.\n\nI had a spider in my TV one time\n\nAn ant died in my monitor half a year ago, tried to remove him, but didn't succeed, now he's crucified in there\n\nI wonder what it looks like from the bug's perspective.\n\nCongratulations on your new insect boy.\n\nIt's not a bug, it's a feature.\n\nYou are gonna have to do some old school debugging! how exciting!\n\nThat pixel is more alive than the rest of them!\n\nBugs are so fucking stupid. What does it hope to find in there??\n\nFound one of these in a small TV. Fortunately it died somewhere other than the screen itself.\n\nIt’s Tron\n\nX- Files theme song needed\n\nLooks like your Gameboy gained a new 'bug' feature! Next level gaming experience right there.\n\nThe question is, who do you call? Tech guy or pest control?\n\nNooo thank you.\n\n[deleted]\n\nNot exactly a pixel either\n\nThank you for the footage OP. I now can those these magical creatures to people.\n\nIf I could I'd attach a picture of them I've managed to take with a smartphone. They are actually quite agile and have 6 legs and eyes.\n\nAntman\n\nI think it has a virus\n\nCould just be a common bug but I would take it to a doctor just to be safe\n\nPoor bastard\n\nHow did you even notice this?\n\nIt was really hard not to. I’m playing on a GBA micro so it’s right in my face. I was playing Pokémon and sorting my boxes so the background was solid white. Also I’m 99% sure I’m autistic.\n\nThat’s a UAP.\n\nI had this happen once on a laptop screen. It was super tiny.\n\nMy brother had a bug die in his monitor, so you're not alone. Super annoying though.\n\nbros chillin\n\nYou mean they are IN the computer?\n\nIts from a yokai\n\nI had an ant in a monitor once. Not sure what happened to it, but it either got out or at least had the courtesy to die off screen.\n\nThat is not dead which can eternal lie\n\nYour game boy got crabs\n\nOP did necromancy ritual wrong\n\nThat’s an alive pixel\n\nMy TV has a dead ant in the middle of the screen. It annoys me to no end.\n\nAh, it's a zombie pixel.\n\nI had a dead spider in my TV like this.  Took a while but it eventually disintegrated and fell to the bottom.\n\nThis happens to Apple laptops all the time\n\nBelongs in r/ufo\n\nTime to put mothballs or cedar balls in yr electronics storage."

The same money people spend on junk food, or other games.\n\n🌎👨‍🚀🔫👨‍🚀\n\n\nAlways has been\n\nNo they aren't. I've seen plenty of average joes buy this stuff. It's not just the whales. There aren't enough whales for it to be profitable.\n\nJust watched a video where a guy showed that a fuck ton of people that bought the 500$ LOL Ahri skin bought it with a loan.\n\nNot surprised tbh. They're League players, they belong in a psych ward.\n\nHighly doubt it. Numbers just wouldn't make sense. What, the small minority of people are buying the same skin 10,000 times?\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's the majority of players buying these skins. Players who don't come on reddit to talk about this stuff.\n\n\nEdit: Clarification here. OP said whale market. People who spend on skins here and there are not whales. His whole statement makes it sound like only rich ppl spend money. \n\n\nYes, I realize that most players don't spend on F2P games. The players who do are technically a \"minority\". But given the number of all ppl who spend on F2P, the vast majority of THEM are not whales and are notnrich. They are normal people.\n\nThis is a weird naive narrative and I don't understand why it gets repeated so frequently. It's ok if you don't like stupid skins or have enough extra cash to waste on this stuff. But saying this just shows you're ignorant to the real perception the general public has and how much money mtx generate....\n\nThere's plenty of people spending $20 a year or less on this game and sometimes the sometimes $20 skin from a license IP is the exact thing they want to spend $20 on.\n\nThey read something about \"whales\" at some point and now repeat it in every thread about microtransactions even when it makes zero sense. No whale is buying 20,000 copies of the homelander skin. The homelander skin isn't there for the whales, this isn't a gatcha game. It's there because lots of people don't mind spending a few bucks to get something they like. And there's nothing ethically wrong about that \n\nRedditors are walking dunning kruger effect at this point. They don't have any idea what they are talking about, but are very confident about it. And because it fits the circlejerk, they'll get upvoted for it.\n\nIt's probably just time some people realize \"gamers\" aren't a monolithic audience, and different people will buy different things.\n\n[removed]\n\nPeople buying a single skin for $20, instead of buying a new whole game with that money...  \nCrazy that, that skin took less time and effort to make than a whole game, price and value just doesn't match.\n\nAnd yet people were wondering why Blizzard would cancel their PvE modes lol, why bother going through all that effort when a skin will make way more money at a fraction of the cost? A lot of people complain about skin prices but that doesn't stop me from seeing the newest one in every game.\n\nWhich is why whenever someone asks why Blizzard cancelled PvE, my immediate first question is, \"Have you bought their skins lately?\"\n\nBecause if you have been buying their bullshit MTX despite the broken promises, you are literally telling them it's perfectly fine to fuck us as much as they want.\n\nVote with your wallet and all that.\n\nWeirdest part to me is that they are FPS games meaning 99% of the time you can’t even see your skin. Why would you lay $20 for a product you cant even see majority of the time?\n\nbecause the other people you’re playing with/against will see it, &amp; they want to look cool for them\n\nYou don’t see the clothes you’re wearing most of the time and people get the shirt with the funny design\n\nIt doesn't even have to be a lot of people.  How much did that Homelander skin cost to make, including licensing?  There's a reason \"whales\" are a thing on games like this; you don't need THAT many people to buy this to make a decent profit off it.\n\nI will never understand the leaps required to drop that much cash on digital cosmetics of any kind. This extends to Discord too, where a *fucking avatar frame* costs anywhere from $6-10.\n\nA fast food entree for a GIF... *A GIF!!*\n\nThe fact the animated avatars cost like that is crazy 😭\n\n“Mainstream audience respond positively to brand crossovers they recognize” is more accurate title\n\nAll audiences do \n\nNerd audiences love niche crossovers.\n\nWhy would Homelander need a gun?\n\nWhy does Sonic need a car?\n\nTo give the other racers a chance.\n\nAnd honestly with Sonics' personality it kinda makes sense, he's a goofball who wants to have fun\n\nWhy does God need a ship?\n\nBastard. Beat me to it.\n\nWhat does god need with a star ship?\n\nI've been saying this for years. I'm one of the three people on this planet that likes Sonic R. The concepts were great. The faster characters run on foot, the slower characters have vehicles. It's not complicated!\n\nHave you played Sonic R? That's why he needs a car.\n\nspeaking of this there is actually a mod to remove Sonic kart and make him run on foot lol\n\nIts's a PR tour to show his support for the 2nd ammendment while he is running for president.\n\nFuck yea! Homelander 2024!\n\nAnd before you say anything, yea I saw &gt;!those alternative fact videos where he killed a bunch of people and I know his girlfriend is literally Nazi.!&lt; \n\nBut if that is true, that just makes him more relatable. We all have our flaws and it’s good to know he’s one of us.\n\nDon't listen to those starlighters, the moon isn't real!\n\nThose starlighters are turning the frogs gay! The frogs weren't gay last season!\n\nRight?  Dude just lasers everything cause anything else is too much effort.\n\nHe does actually laser people as his finisher if you sneak up behind someone and melee them. It's pretty cool. The game as a whole sucks, but I loved The Boys collab.\n\nLet alone a gun rack??\n\nParty on, Wayne.\n\nParty on, Garth\n\nYou don't like it? Fine! You know Wayne, if you're not careful you're gonna lose me...\n\n🤣\n\nI lost you six months ago!\n\nAre you mental? Get the net!\n\nWHY WOULD A PLUMBER BE FIGHTING A MONKEY!?\n\nBecause the monkey stole his girlfriend. Keep up.\n\nAs much as people shit on fortnite, at least they do their crossovers justice.\n\nI rather not call these AAA games we should call them a new label I'd say Corporate games\n\nCorporate games is actually a great fkng idea. I would love if this caught on.\n\nI'm definitely going to be referring to them as such from now on\n\nTo what? Corporate Games?\n\nI think he's talking about Corporate Games.\n\nCall Of Duty, Best Corporate Game out there\n\n&gt; Call Of Duty, Best Corporate Game out there\n\nRated 10 outta 10...by Corporate Reviewers.\n\nI don’t know if it’s the best, but it’s without a doubt the Most Corporate Game\n\nYup corporate games\n\nI'm here for it, let's make a change gamers\n\nNow this is the kind of shit I can get behind.  Corpo/Corporate Games it is!\n\nCan't wait to see which game will win the Corpo Game of the Year!\n\nEA: Bonjour!\n\nUbisoft: SA another employee\n\nBlizzard: steal breast milk of employee\n\nCorporate games it is, new label for AAA\n\nAAA still exists. These ones are corporate games though\n\nI'd like to think AAA is still a thing. Games like 'Baldur's Gate 3' or 'Kena: Bridge of Spirits' are AAA in my eyes. And it's just the very commercialised, microtransaction-heavy, formula-driven games which are considered \"Corporate Games\". Love the label.\n\nIt started here\n\nGamerz rise up! That'll show em\n\nThat’d be pretty fetch\n\nIf you have to ask, you’re streets behind.\n\nStop trying to make fetch happen\n\nIt's rad man\n\nYou play as non-executive employee and the goal is to climb up the corporate hierarchy\n\nI think I have a good definition for you guys! I love this idea.\n\nCorporate Game: When the total cost of production is as high or higher than most AAA games, but such a large percentage of the cost goes to marketing and/or licensing that the actual cost of development is significantly lower than most AAA games.\n\n&gt; Corporate games is actually a great fkng idea\n\nAny game with aggressive monetization and mechanics that push people towards making in game purchases. All of those game with those systems are really shitty shitty games that has usually bastardized some beloved IP (eg Diablo ). It was not till they turned that feature way down in Diablo 3 till it became playable as a game, till that point it was an auction house simulator with the diablo world as a waiting room.\n\nThat's actually not a bad name for these, Corporate games fit's well.\n\nMassive IP's which use their brand to charge extortionate price for minimal effort, while milking every drop they can get their hands on, including targeting children as the main audience in a number of occasions.\n\nOh, that’s going to stick. Corporate games perfectly describes the approach to pretty much all of those games.\n\nCorporate games it is\n\nCOD ruined everything haha\n\nMore like Madden.  Madden was releasing an annual game 13 years before call of Duty was released.\n\nits funny in a way. the madden series debuted at a time in home-gaming hardware where year-over-year changes were pretty drastic. there was reason to make a new one each year. but you know how it goes: once they taste money in the water, they cant ever let it go. so they insisted that changing the names was another $60+ a year.\n\nCalling them this from now on\n\nDone\n\nCorpo games it is then.\n\nBurn corpo shit!\n\nHomelander is so fitting then with his Vought stuff.\n\nSo it is, and so it shall be. Corpo games 👍\n\nCorporate games is so gross, but perfect.\n\nplay corporate games, win corporate prizes\n\nI'm calling most \"AAA\" games corporate games now.\n\nOh that’s good. Calling a bunch of pretentious bands “Corporate Rock” did them no favors back in the 70s / 80s.\n\nI like this. I consider GoW and Uncharted AAA but not corporate games\n\npfft, look at this noob who didn't need to open his mountain dew verification can to get the true ending in both games (which feature various sony characters including Spiderman hyping the new Sony TV Line)\n\nExactly, referring to these games as AAA is an insult to actual AAA games\n\n\"AAA game\" doesn't even have to mean anything, it's purely a marketing term in a gaming context.\n\nCorporate games it is.\n\nFuck corpo games.  It is getting coined.  Start boosting this everywhere!\n\nCorpo games, I like it.\n\nI nth this statement!\n\nIt's less that they've lost creativity and more that they saw Fortnite making bank with a shit ton of crossovers, so they want to do it too.\n\nbut we've still got games like Elden Ring, Baldur's Gate 3, Alan Wake 2, Tears of the Kingdom, etc.\n\nIt’s somewhat baked into Fortnite’s DNA, maybe because they started early and it’s a pretty goofy game but I’ve always found it charming.\n\nWhen Call of Duty adds Homelander or whatever it just really feels out of place.\n\nSnoop Dogg was in Call of Duty 11 years ago before Fortnite was a thought. \n\nDanny Trejo and Sarah Michelle Gellar were being chased around by a giant zombie George Romero 13 years ago in the first Black Ops.\n\nSnoop Dogg didn't get an actual skin until Vanguard though. He was just an announcer voice you could buy for 3$ along with a Drill Sgt.\n\nSpider-Man was in THPS2\n\nThey killed Save the World\n\nHonestly they just pivoted from something that wasn’t that good. I’m sure there are people that loved it but in the grand scheme of things it probably wasn’t worth the resources. It’s not like they removed it from the game though (right? I could be wrong).\n\nI think they just shifted development to BR and decided to release it anyways, albeit in a disappointing state.\n\nThat's exactly what they did. I was gifted a founders pack for Fortnite during the closed beta and Save The World is in almost the exact same state now as it was then.  It wasn't a bad mode, Epic just saw the money in their eyes from BR mode and abandoned it.\n\nWhy spend lots of money developing new mechanics when 12 year olds will use mom and dad's credit card to buy the newest *insert series here* MTX?\n\nYa it started as save the world but battle royal games were starting to get attention so they tried it out and it blew up so all the focus went there. Save the world was pretty fun imo and grinding in that for vbucks was a great way to get battle passes back in the day.\n\nNo they didn't. The market killed Save The World when players overwhelming spent time playing the Battle Royal. If it was getting tons of players it would have had development time spent producing content for it.\n\nSave the world was also $10, fortnite was free.\n\nWas inevitable, Fortnite didn’t have a clear identity until the battle royale mode was introduced\n\nThey went from Zombie survival sandbox horror to\n\nZombie tower defense game to\n\nBattle Royale to\n\nBattle Royale + Gmod\n\nEpic games would be very different and a lot smaller if they didn’t switch from save the world and focus on br\n\nI’m finally gonna buy BG3 tonight tbh, I’ve been telling myself that I’ll get it if I see it mentioned in random comments on Reddit at least 10 times in a day and you are the lucky winner! No prize sadly.\n\nHope you enjoy! It’s quite the journey\n\nI absolutely will, I’m huge on narratives and dialogue, I’m looking forward to all the lore mostly.\n\nYou'll have a great time down by the river\n\nYou’re in for a treat then there’s so much lol\n\nThat’s why I’m spending the money, I want a digital BOOK tbh. This is why I’m addicted to Fallout NV after all these years still, I need that lore and good narrative. I neeeeeeed it.\n\nOh...oh buddy......Baldur's Gate is about to eat you *alive*. Not that it matters because BG3 can suck in just about anyone but, you are quite literally *the* target audience. Stock up on snacks and warn your friends and family.\n\nMy family knows already haha. I am looking forward to being consumed, believe me.\n\nDisco Elysium as well.\n\nIf you find a big barn near the beginning and there's loud noises coming from inside, open the front doors. Lol 😆 🤣 😂\n\nGotta be sex stuff\n\nYou'll never know until you do it\n\nShrodingers sex barn\n\nI don't like or play Fortnite but I remember as a kid wishing for a game that let you play all your favorite characters like that so I get it's popularity and definitely get publishers trying to get such crossovers in their own games.  Especially other shooters and such trying to compete for the same audience\n\nWhat annoys me with CoD is there are so many military franchises they could use skins from but they go for stuff that just doesn't belong in CoD. The biggest stretch should be like The Terminator\n\nand yet it sells like crazy, wild how that happens\n\nIt’s really just live service AAA games. AAA games like Baldur’s Gate 3 and Alan Wake 2 that do new things still exist.\n\nI'm so tired of the rhetoric that \"the video game industry\" is dying or something because the *richest corporations in the entire industry* are going creatively bankrupt.  \n\nThere has been so much innovation and creativity in gaming in the last decade. Prey 2017, Baldur's Gate 3, Alan Wake 2, Red Dead 2, Life is Strange, What Remains of Edith Finch, Elden Ring and so, so many more that have completely changed what video games are capable to portraying. \n\nThe game industry is more varied and exciting than it's ever been, you just have to be willing to put in the smallest amount of work to find the games you should play instead of just basing it on whatever you happen to get a YouTube or Twitter banner ad for this week\n\nThank you, this is literally some “music sucks these days” level of shaking your fist at the clouds.\n\nThere’s plenty of criticism to be had with the modern games industry but so many people just use that as a vessel to peddle their bitter, out of touch boomer complaints about how much better things used to be.\n\ngamers are hands down the worst consumers\n\nCouldn't have said it better. \n\n\n\n\n\"Video games all suck these days! The industry is creatively bankrupt and dying!\"\n\nScreams the guy who exclusively plays Call of Duty and Overwatch.\n\nPeople just have to learn to accept that in capitalism, the natural lifecycle of a game company is to eventually trend towards removing all elements of risk.\n\nGames are extremely risky to produce. No other industry commits often half a decade or more to a single project, with entire teams of engineers staffed full-time, to produce a product that could 1: fail entirely halfway through, or 2: release as a flop.\n\nShareholders do not want those risks. If you tell them 'We can make a reasonable polished action adventure game with some collectables and some cross-over skins and we forecast it will earn $X million.\" that's what they want to hear. They don't want to hear \"We're really pushing the envelope here, we're breaking all the rules and making something really unique. We don't know how much it will earn, or how fun it will be.\"\n\nMark my words in 10-20 years we'll be on here talking about how we miss the old Larian that took risks and made creative games like Baldur's Gate 3. While some hit new young studio is releasing new bangers and taking the real risks.\n\nLarian has a shot as long as they stay private. It really is tragic though how the current stock market system tends to hollow out companies over time.\n\nOn another note, I also hate the gamers who act like gaming has been shit for a long time until Baldur's Gate 3 and Elden Ring released. There are so many other games other than these 2. Don't act like good games don't exist anymore aside from ER and BG3. Mfs really be listing good games to play and these are the only two that come to their mind.\n\nCame here to say this. Elden Ring and BG3 are literally the best games to come out for a VERY long time.\n\nand Disco Elysium and Hades and\n\nSometimes I feel like people complaining on this app play CoD, Ubisoft, EA games only, then complain about the industry as a whole lol.\n\nPlease y’all, branch out. There’s an insane amount of great games that just came out last year.\n\nI really don't even think they even play any of these games.\n\nThey only cry about it on forums for that EZ internet points.\n\nYeah a lot of people who complain about games like that don’t even understand the appeal those games have for people, or even the market for those games. The people who are playing those games aren’t typically going to be playing Baldur’s Gate 3 and that’s fine. But they can have their big game just like everyone else can.\n\nIt's actually so annoying because imo gaming is actually in a decent okay state, it could be better but it's not the worst it's ever been, but people only literally buy CoD and then complain and it's like, no wonder AAA gaming sucks, you're consistently buying and playing the WORST franchises.\n\nSo play different games? There are tons of amazing games out there\n\nNo. I wanna be mad and feel superior and make posts on Reddit so everyone can know how mad and superior I am\n\nAh like a true gamer. Carry on\n\nOP references licensed collaborations only and... complains?\n\n*Only plays Battlefield, CoD, Fortnite, PubG, Overwatch and Valorant*\n\n\n\"- This industry is dying!!!!!\"\n\nAh yes, I forgot all AAA games are first person shooters 🙄\n\nPretty sure it's been like this for at least a decade now.\n\nDead Space and Battlefield is a pretty sick crossover\n\n[deleted]\n\nIt's a pretty decent game mode too! A nice change of pace from the standard game modes. \n\nAlso, a dead space crossover was announced as an April Fools joke back in April...my guess is there was enough positive response to it (or else enough disappointment that it was only a joke) that they decided to try and make it work.\n\nIt's also ya know, another EA franchise so there's more of a straight logical leap than The Boys inserted into CoD.\n\nAccording to OP, Crossovers = lost creativity.\n\nSuper Smash Bros. is peak uncreativity. /s\n\nOk but that Optimus skin looks dope as fuck.\n\nEvery time I get pog I type in all caps \"I AM OPTIMUS REIN\"\n\nImo the Optimus and Bumblebee skin are some of the best skins in OW.\n\n&gt; Every time I get pog I type in all caps \"I AM OPTIMUS REIN\"\n\nFuck me lol.  Reinstalling now.\n\nFor real lol, it’s just a skin and looks pretty cool.  If you don’t like it simply don’t buy it.  As long as it’s not pay-to-win I couldn’t give less of a shit.  Besides, doom posters like OP act like this is *all* AAA gaming is nowadays when there are still plenty of “creative” AAA games releasing every single year with stuff like Baldurs Gate 3, Elden Ring, Alan Wake 2, God of War Ragnarok, Armored Core VI, etc.\n\nAAA games bad give upvotes\n\nJesus Christ. \n\nThis shit has been going on for over 15 years. \n\nIt's all karma farming at this point.\n\nWhy? \n\nI mean, I see no issue here, just a game collaborating with a franchise.\n\nI really like Battlefield x Dead Space, it's a shame that 2042 was a failure and it's difficult to enjoy it.\n\nSame for Transformers and The Boys, I really like those two franchises.\n\nYeah, I mean this isn’t exactly a new thing. I remember skating around as Iron Man 20+ years ago in Tony Hawk.\n\nYou beat me to it by like 5 mins, I used the same example! Not to mention Soul Calibur x Star Wars.\n\nIt’s the standard Reddit circlejerk of hating on mainstream things. People often forget that even with its popularity Reddit is still a minority,which is proven every time a CoD comes out breaks some sales record while people on here decry it the worst thing ever. \n\nNever understood shitting on something you don’t like instead of hyping something you do but that seems to get all the attention\n\nHonestly, I'd even say the Overwatch collabs *are* actually creative because they design skins for the collab that still fit the character model. It's not like they just take a render of Optimus Prime and throw it in the game, it's a custom designed skin for Reinhardt that has Optimus Prime's aesthetic.\n\nthis Is very much a situation of op wants to feel high and mighty by hate posting about things they don’t like. Though I agree with them in the sense that “skins” in games suck and I dislike the concept at least when it’s paid for. Honestly I tend to ignore these types of post just due to the negative nature of them.\n\n  \nedit: I forgot to say I completely respect that you enjoy these sorts of things in games just in case my commen implied otherwise.\n\nI know people in this sub love to hate on OW but how can they say it has no creativity? There are other valid criticisms but that is certainly not one.\n\nAlso that Optimus Rein skin is 👌\n\nya'll are so fuckin dramatic\n\nThis is the sub for it, the sky is *always* falling here\n\nYea im ngl some collabs are fire. Im not a fan of transformers, but i have to admit the OW2 collabs with them is great. The reinhardt skin and bastion skin came out AMAZING. I can see the effort to make the look translate well to the games style.\n\nFr there’s some braindead takes here lol\n\nUhh. Alan Wake 2 would like a word.\n\nBG3, Mario Wonder are pretty creative. Playing as Zelda is long over-due. But that upcoming game looks pretty creative. \n\nAlan Wake 2 as well... Lotta sequels but still *damn* creative.\n\nI totally understand these kinds of posts but what does this mean for the people who genuinely enjoy having two of their favorite pieces of media crossover? \n\nLike honestly it’s hard for me to even be mad when I think about it that way. Sure, it seems like theirs no creativity but crossovers can also just be fun for the sake of being.\n\nI’m not sure why you’re getting downvoted. It’s possible to dislike the current state of AAA games and still support a crossover with a series you like.\n\n Reddit gon Reddit I guess lmao. \n\nYeah man. Just an observation. For example, I’d LOVE to see Helldivers 2 have some awesome crossovers for costumes or something from Star Wars ect. May not be possible but still a cool idea just like the ones in the picture.\n\nMy stance on this kind of thing is that I don't really care what other people want to spend money on until it encroaches on existing game franchises. We couldn't get a new Arkham game because WB wanted to use batman heft to sell some loot shooter sludge.\n\nMy dude, crossovers have been a thing in games for a looooong time.\n\nImagine liking game x and popular media franchise y, and being excited to see them together. /s\n\nNGL, I didn't not have \"collabs are one of the 4 horseman of the gaming apocalypse\" on my bingo card for the week...\n\nCounter point: this is a nice way to get people interested in other franchises or games without having to drop a ton of money on a project that might fail. I got into The Boys because of the cod crossover, I had never heard of it prior and now I’m enjoying a different superhero show.\n\nPlenty of good AAA games out there. Cyberpunk. Baldur's Gate 3. Elden Ring. Tears of the Kingdom. Final Fantasy 7 Remake + Rebirth. Alan Wake 2 to name a few. Just stop buying the lazy cash grab shit.\n\nA collab is now bad?\n\nThe Boys getting any kind of merch is the literal definition of irony\n\nHe’s mad at collaborations! oh no! Nobody tell him about Fortnite\n\nHuh? As a kid i would have went CRAZY for stuff like this. Can you imagine playing as your favorite power ranger in call of duty? We’re living in a golden era of games if you’re a kid\n\nAAA gaming has been in what I call the \"pig slop\" phase for a while now. It's all just mixed up garbage for you to gorge yourself on without any real quality, taste or creativity.\n\nJust a big trough of \"game\". Eat up swine!\n\nIt's not just gaming. It's gaming, movie, etc. Foods are getting \"crossovers\" these days that nobody asked for. Corporations stopped caring about anything but algorithms and shareholders.\n\nI heard a Lowe's / Messi cross promotion radio ad today, and it was very confusing. Or when McDonald's did rapper branded meals for like 6 months.\n\nThis doesn't apply for a lot of AAA games like Elden Ring, Cyberpunk, The Witcher etc. those games are not indies or AA.\n\nLol calling games like BG3 and Elden ring pig slop"

Clowns. As a huge *The Evil Within fan*, I'll never forgive them for this, and all the industry sycophants defending their millionaire  CEO friend on Twitter for firing 2000+ people can piss off.\n\nEvil Within 1 &amp; 2 were so amazing. Im sad that there’s no 3rd coming. I’ll have to settle for replaying them.\n\nI wanted a part 3 so bad. Nothing quite like the psychedelic horror that those two games brought to the table.\n\nAt least we got a 2.\n\nIf you haven't tried the second game's first person mode, it's a lot of fun and amps up the scares in more than a few cases.\n\nFirst person mode? I’ll have to replay this I didn’t know there was one, when I played I stealth killed am the overworld enemies while exploring before doing the main game and then found out none of them respawn and had a very quiet east of the time\n\nI too am a big time evil within enthusiast\n\nIn fairness, Shinji Mikami left Tango of his own accord at the beginning of 2023, so it always felt like TEW3 was unlikely. Still sucks though.\n\nHaven’t played Hifi yet but loved The Evil Within so much\n\nYou don't say \n\nWhat happened with hi fi rush\n\nThey closed Tango Gameworks\n\nFUCKING GENIUS! Shut down a company that created game of the year for so many people... Microsoft is so fucking dumb. Next time, maybe just wait to put it on gamepass??? Side note, could microsoft just relinquish the rights of hifi rush 2 to tango gameworks and let them continue to exist but not under Microsoft? Its stupid that now we will never get a sequel because I assume Microsoft still owns hi fi rush? Maybe they will let another studio do it with the same people, but that's probably some cope.\n\nApparently they were literally in the process of proposing a sequel to Microsoft. Oh and right after shutting down Tango, Microsoft then proceeded to talk to their own employees about how they needed more smaller games that would bring them awards.\n\nMicrosoft seems to have gotten confused by their OS business and doesn't realize that people actually play more than one game at a time, so they don't need to extinguish all but their best options.\n\nTango was bought as part of ZeniMax, the CEO planned to leave way back and left in 2023, the closure was possibly planned way in advance. We don’t know what’s left in the studio, or if they are merging the core team and ip with other studio.\n\nI guess some people don't care when CEO's of massive corporations shut down studios of highly rated award winning games because everyone played it on Gamepass after phil spent years telling everyone Gamepass is the future of gaming and then canned the studio because of a lack of sales when gamers played the game of Gamepass exactly as Phil told them to. \n\nNow a fantastic studio that gave X Box their only purely positive publicity this generation is closed and Phils base has been nuked but it's ok. As the CEO of the corporation that owns the game he gets unlimited free credits. Sadly the devs who made the game Phil said was a huge success by every conceivable metric don't have that luxury and still have to pay their mortgage and look after their family but unfortunately for them in the real world unlimited v bucks don't exist. I for one hope Phip gets nuked hourly and forced into unemployment like the workers at the studio he condemned for lack of sales caused by the inevitable results of his very own Game pass vision 😂\n\nthats a risk u take for setting up camp in front of whitesprings, phil knew that\n\nIt looks like a direct hit to the camp to me🗿\n\nWould you recommend this game?\n\nyes. I've been playing for pretty much over 2 years straight, it has a cool world to explore. you need an online connection to play and they emphasize playing with friends, but the game can 100% be done solo. people talk alot of shit but it's my 2nd fav fallout, if the quests were stronger would be my 1st. and since u can always get it for less than 10$ I'd consider it a bargain\n\nI'll be honest, it was barely a serviceable game at launch (was one of the EA players super excited) but I just picked it up again after so many years and it's not as bad as I remember it. There's much less chances of big bosses spawning (holy jeesus that launch was hilarious for that). It scratches maybe half of the itches I wanted in a standard Fallout game, and for that I'm almost 25 hours in, and it's not getting boring.\n\nThose early days before the one wasteland update were pretty hardcore. I kinda missed the madness when I returned after a long break, even if the game as a whole is way more playable now.\n\n&gt; I'm almost 25 hours in\n\n25 hours into a Fallout game? You gotta pump those numbers!\n\n&gt; 25 hours into a Fallout game?\n\nJust about done with character creation! :)\n\nHow do you play solo? I love Fallout, but the idea of not being able to pause, and having to watch out for other people online, is the opposite of what I want in a game.\n\nYou can set yourself to pacifist mode to disable pvp. It is mostly a cooperative game\n\n[deleted]\n\nIt has pvp, but everyone runs pacifist mode anyway.\n\nOn Steam achievements only 12% of players have even killed another player. That was one of my main concerns starting the game but it’s been real chill\n\nIt's not really crowded. When I played you would sometimes see like a guy clearing a building or someone chilling in their camp.\n\nThe other peoples camps were nice to visit to see what they built and you could buy ammo from their vending machines.\n\nI think by default it's peaceful mode, so they can't kill you even if they want to.\n\nI played through all story quests solo without problems, I mostly join teams for shared perks and stuff, but aside of that I do everything solo. I think even the expeditions can be done solo.\n\nI'm the kinda person to alt-tab out of the game to scroll reddit or something too and the worst that has happened was me getting automatically kicked after being afk for too long (I think the timer is 30 minutes if you're generally afk and like 1 hour or something if you're using a chair in game).\n\nBut you can just join again when you're back and you'll be at the same place.\n\nI mean you don't really have to interact with anyone, and sure not pausing in inventory sucks at first but just do a quick checkup of your surroundings before and youre golden, plus i picked up a key for this game for 1,5$ so id say its worth :))\n\nLet’s just say that because it is a live service game, it was inevitably updated to the point that so many things have improved way beyond their single player titles. You would be shocked at the things that it has better than Starfield, for example, like the camp building. I’m pretty sure 76 currently has the best housing mechanism of any games out there. You can really look part of the map. And it’s not just rust/ark atrocious boxes of woods (thought you can make ones). It’s “living” world so the npcs are doing things all the time albeit in cycles. Imo, I think this is how setting like fallout is supposed to be played.\n\nnaw that’s a direct hit. if it was accidental, the nuke center would have been by the ws golf club or on the ws.\n\nAs someone that dose not play the game what is the worth of this act?\n\nIt destroys your CAMP but if you have enough materials, you can repair it with a few clicks. Also spawns high level enemies with good loot for a little bit of time\n\nMothman just chilling in the crater that was that mofos base\n\nI read this, log in to 76 and BAM, Vengeful Mothman IN MY CAMP.\n\nAnd where does the game spawn me? Inside my foundations. He dies, I get nothing.\n\nWHAM BAM ALAKAZAM I got a mothman in my base\n\n[To the Tune of YMCA:]\n\nMOTHMAN\n\nBetter watch out for nukes\n\nI SAID MOTHMAN\n\nYou better put up your dukes...\n\nI SAID MOTHMAN\n\nCause your in a new camp!\n\nThere's no need. to. be. so Venge-ful\n\n🎺🎺🎺It’s fun to stay at CAMP P3!\n\nIt's fun to stay at the CAMP OF P3!!\n\nThey have all of the rads, for young ghouls to enjoy.\n\nYou can mutate with all the boys!\n\nAt this time of year? At this time of day? In this part of the country? Localized entirely within your camp!??!\n\nIt just works!\n\nzdf gg dfzzg dfzg dfzg dff dg\n\nWhat is ample warning? Like a couple of minutes?\n\nzd hhz dh zdfzhdf z hdf\n\nwhat a weird game\n\nYou know who thinks like that?  A Synth, that's who!\n\nWhat if you aren't playing at the time?\n\ncamps are only there when the player that owns them is logged on\n\nI always wondered about this, then. How does the game avoid multiple people putting camps in the same place?\n\nFirst come, first serve. If someone is in your camp spot when you login to a server it won’t place your camp. You can either server hop until it places or move it somewhere else.\n\nFor the memes, he should just server rollback his camp drop 100 nukes on the dudes region and wipe his resources. And then undo it.\n\nThis just makes me think of the scene in Lucifer where God blows up Dan's head for sleeping with his wife, and immediately resets reality with only Dan remembering the event.\n\nHow does one \"remember\" or even just notice the event of their head blowing up?\n\nDivine power.\n\nWell, and Lucifer remembers it.\n\nThis information was also useful for me.\n\nIn 76, you can launch nuke to specific spots to summon raid bosses.\n\nNormal enemies in the area also become the stronger one, plants become rare crafting mat.\n\nIt's not easy to launch one tho, you have to through quite hard dungeon to launch one but some players could do it in 10 minutes.\n\nI mean you just glitch through the ceiling. Takes like 5 minutes to launch one. Bout the only thing you limited by is keys. Usually the higher level players will sell them for 50 caps tho since they can't be bothered to run them.\n\nHaven’t touched 76 in a while, but the nuke silo frag mine on the shelf putting you out of bounds thing is *still* possible? That’s wild\n\nThats Fallout baby\n\nThat's Bethesda baby\n\nThe engine...the engine never changes...\n\nCreation Engine.\n\nThat's that Bethesda magic, baby! \n\nNo? I thought they patched this a few months ago. Because I tried lol.\n\nGoddamn live service for a fallout game is so stupid\n\nIt's fun though.\n\nSo basically this dude threw bunch of loot and spent effort away just to cause a minor inconvenience to someone lol\n\nIsn't that the entire point of gaming? To have fun?\n\nClose but the real point is to annoy each other in pvp\n\nMy fondest memory in gaming is the odd hate mail I get here and there \n\nI fucking genuinely love them,  they make me laugh every time I think about em\n\nI beat a dude in a fighting game and used 2 specific moves more often than others and he hit me with\n\n&gt;GG there's more than 2 moves in the game tho \n\n&gt;I send back\n\n&gt;only needed those 2 to beat you ggs\n\nCalled me trash after that lmao\n\nJust yesterday I played this dude in mlb the show. He immediately messages me talking shit in the first inning. \n\n\nDoes a bunch of toxic shit like replay hr and brags about taking the lead.\n\n\nIn the 6th sends me a message \"here's a tip first pitch sinkers are super obvious\" \n\n\nI didn't respond.\n\n\nI hit a 3 run walkoff to win 7-4\n\n\nAll I send him back was \"anymore tips?\"\n\nOne thing I heard about sports games is they the king of toxic shit talk \n\nIf only I liked them 😔\n\nAny competitive game/genre is gonna have a fanbase that religiously plays that game/genre and takes it way too seriously. I even got hate mail when I played the Crash Team Racing remake.\n\nGot a similar message once, dude was all, \" can you do anything other than freeze me? My response was,\" efficiency, efficiency, efficiency. \"\n\nFighting game scrubs need to learn the hard way\n\nIf you can't stop me from doing what I'm doing than you bet your ass imma keep doing it\n\nI'm not even trolling either,  I'm giving them the opportunity to learn how to beat it\n\nThey should thank me\n\nSend an invoice,  45 minutes of advanced tutoring on defense...500.00 USD\n\nYou should have sent him the classic essay, [Introducing the scrub](https://www.sirlin.net/ptw-book/introducingthe-scrub), which is all about that person's self-limiting mentality in fighting games.\n\nSilos aren’t hard to do so not really that much effort and loot is easy to get.\n\n&gt; So basically this dude threw bunch of loot and spent effort away just to cause a minor inconvenience to someone lol\n\nFor a geared player who's done them a bunch it's a few minutes of running around and spending one cheap and easily farmed item to target it. Looking at the map it also looks like it also covered at least some of the golf course, so it wasn't a complete waste (or at least that *was* a high mob-density area with a bunch of the right sorts of plants, I'm not sure if it still is because it's been a year or two since I played). One of the standard flux farming spots was dropping the nuke just slightly north and west of the one in the picture, so it covered the whole country club area.\n\nsounds like the average Rust experience tbh\n\nAnd the CEO of XBOX is going to be more than happy with the free engagement and extra social media push that he's actually playing the games after years of complaints of CEOs that don't play games.\n\nSort of entirely predictable when you join an openworld PvP game with your well-known and verifiable xbox handle. Just yet another piece of manufactured PR.\n\nComedy. It gets funnier if someone continues to nuke every camp he sets up.\n\nThen phil Spencer shuts down the game and has the real laugh.\n\nCouldn't he just get his dad to ban the people dropping nukes.\n\nAnd nothing of value would be lost.\n\nExcept 76 has been booming lately and the game is good now\n\nAs the others said it’s mostly just to be funny cus it destroyes the camp and causes you to have to go around clicking for repairs. That area near whitesprings is a frequent target for nukes because it has a ton of mats that you can harvest for flux(crafting materials spawned by the nuke that you used for high level mods), so sometimes when someone needs to farm Flux they will hit that area and any camps nearby to help funny as well.\n\nI think you can repair everything in one go in the camp computer\n\nGosh darn it. Enemies are always blasting bits off my house and I didn't know this.\n\nman... feel like most of the comments don't really explain it.\n\nGuess he’ll need to consult the services of Relocation, Relocation.\n\n(Wrong Phil Spencer I know)\n\nI thought I was still in r/CasualUK for a minute, and was thoroughly confused\n\nI thought damn Kirsty is really competitive, she really didn't like that couple picking Phil's choice of that maisonette in Shoreditch.\n\nThat’s the only Phil Spencer I know, so I’m pretty confused haha\n\nI find it hilarious that the news of someone nuking a ceo has got people asking if they should play this in the comments.\n\nEdit: Does this comment really warrant 4,000 upvotes?\n\nI've been interested in playing a Fallout game for a while. I tried 4 and really put off the idea of 76 since the launch was so bad. And I want to try it now, but I don't want to go through a major grind to get caught up to what's going on now. But this might tip the scales for me to get the game now lol.\n\nThere really isn’t a major grind beyond Legendary Perks and god rolling weapons. Most of the mid game is running open world events and queuing for daily ops.\n\nMostly queuing and having to restart events and ops because three of the four either logged off or are doing something dumb that makes it impossible to continue. \n\nI was gung ho about 76 but it was so slow to get anything fun done unless you had a regular group of friends.\n\nFor events you are generally better off just bouncing around a bit server to server to see if people are running them.  Servers are mixed bags, sometimes people just want to quest and do their own thing, some want to grind events.  Keep in mind too theres a difference between Events and *Public* events.  Events are just triggered by someone getting near their area if the timers up, and are meant to be soloable and don't give as nice of rewards.  Public events are the one that pop up and allow you to travel to them for free, and are expected to be ran in groups and give the good rewards, and are what people are generally going to be running.\n\nOps are a bit trickier with randos because some people will create parties run it for the daily bonus, but then keep the party up without changing the description.  You're best off creating the party yourself in these instances.\n\nI play enough Destiny to get my fill of chasing god roll weapons lmfao. I might try it out this weekend then.\n\n[deleted]\n\nim going solo and im having a lot of fun drinking toilet water and eating corpses\n\nGood job, make sure to save some time to play fallout too\n\nThis ripped me apart 🤣\n\nIf you didn’t like 4, you definitely won’t like 76. \n\nNot trying to shit on 76 in the typical Reddit sense, but it’s by far the worst game in the franchise. I’ve played it, the game has its moments, but I’d never recommend as a first experience over anything else in the series.\n\n4 and 76 are very different games with different goals but it has a lot of fun lore and exploration that makes it worthwhile. You just cannot go into it expecting a massive plot-driven game.\n\nyeah 76 is my favourite bethesda game in the franchise. it does a lot of things right and has great lore. if a person played it closer to launch it's improved a tonne since then.\n\n\"You're getting banned, my dad works for xbox\"\n\nI haven't played this game yet but damn I love the design of the map.\n\nIt looks like a sign you'd see at a zoo\n\nAmusement park signs/maps and zoo sign/maps are the coolest. Some malls have cool maps/signs.\n\nWait till you learn that video game maps and menus are inspired by amusement park layouts\n\nDead Rising 2’s casino map goes hard\n\nthe UI in this game definitely has improved a lot over Fallout 4. It's one of the many thing that has better looks and functionalities that really should have been in FO4's \"\"\"next gen\"\"\" update, but that are completely missing instead\n\nI'd hope so, they had 71 previous chances to really nail it down.\n\nCan u elaborate?\n\nNo, but i will\n\nFast travel from inside buidlings\n\nBlurred transparent background when using the pipboy instead of the actual screen and skipping the tiny animation \n\nLoot all enemies from one body instead of each individually\n\nAid and food item are seperate a category\n\nAll of these.\n\nPlus several other very appreciable things like immediately transform junk into resource at any station, to name one\n\nGenuinely my favorite Fallout world to explore. There is a ton of variety to the locales not including the expeditions. My favorite spot is the Chinese garden temple in the northeast.\n\nThere are dozens of us! It's honestly a beautiful game\n\nIs it something a new player could play solo and enjoy? I know it’s always online so it’s not necessarily a single player game.\n\nYou are not forced to interact with people at all, you can easily go around the game as a solo player and enjoy it to the fullest. (Except a few bosses, during those boss battles you will see a fair bit of players)\n\nYeah, but even during boss battles it's mostly just everyone shooting at the boss and not at each other so it's as much interaction with real people as if you had a bunch of AI followers shooting at it.\n\nI've honestly played solo about 90 percent of the time because I'm still taking in the sights. However, now that my friends have gotten into it I treat it like I'm their companion/follower and am having a blast.\n\nThe map is awesome. There are a lot of aspects of 76 I think actually look amazing, I kinda of wished some of it would come to F4 in the next gen update since 76 feels like a natural progression in terms of gameplay and mechanics.\n\nhis gamertag is P3? i've never played this game if it's a nickname system\n\nYes, his Gamertag is P3\n\nNuke them all!!!\n\nYesterday I was playing with a friend, doing Crane's mission, and our progress was stopped because of this nuke right here. We were a bit annoyed, but just went somewhere else for a while and came back later.\n\nBut now you're telling me that nuke was just to annoy the CEO of Xbox? God, please let it be true, it would be so fucking funny\n\nPhil plays games so yea looks like someone hopped on and decided to nuke the CEO of Microsoft gaming\n\nWho is phil spencer\n\nHe's the CEO of Microsoft Gaming\n\nLvl 40 xbox boss\n\nAka John Xbox. He’s the final boss after you reach a million gamerscore\n\nInsufferable UK TV presenter known for asking rich people if they're happy with their home.\n\nIs this game good now? Not asking that in a bad way. Im actually curious.\n\nIt’s definitely better. I’ve gotten 50ish hours into it since the fallout show, and it’s 10x the game it used to be. That said, it’s definitely live service fallout, take that how you will. Some fun missions, events with a bunch of randoms are cool, build crafting is fun, camp building is satisfying. The wiki is your friend.\n\n[deleted]\n\nThat's just a proper Bethesda title working as intended.\n\nIs there not a lot of griefing?  I'm kinda ambivalent about the Fallout series, although I've bought &amp; played bits of 4 &amp; NV.  I kinda fancied 76 'til I realised it was online.\n\nI despise the weight limit though, big time.\n\nI played some of it about a year ago (about 70 hours) , and it felt like the most kind community I have seen a while. People who saw that I was a beginner, ran at me, dropped me resources, and left. Absolute chads. Nobody was griefing, I only had good interactions. I should start playing again.\n\nIt's pretty tough to grief anyone in this game. If you don't have PvP turned on, other players do a *negligible* amount of damage to you, and they can't realistically destroy your camp or enter locked doors without you opening them up. It's also trivial to fully repair your camp, even if destroyed.\n\nWeight limit is definitely an issue, since storage space is limited, even with the Fallout 1st membership. But it's still somewhat generous, as long as you don't hoard stuff you don't need. You can always try to sell the stuff you don't need to other players by putting it in your vendor's inventory.\n\nAs far as a single-player game goes, it's pretty solid, though. It has a bit of QoL improvements over Fallout 4, and the world itself is really nice and varied. Feels more unique than the Fallout 4 map by a mile.\n\nDepends on your definition of good. Half the grind of warframe, and half the gameplay. I had an absolute blast playing with a friend, and yet at every turn, I was reminded how little “multiplayer” there is in the actual story. All that is hidden behind a facade of fomo, and some decent time sensitive events. Watch [Patriciantv’s](https://youtu.be/ltOZJ9OJexA?si=K9i605jMBB-xk1em) review, and keep in mind the guy is coming from a love of early Bethesda games. If the game still interests you, and you can buy it on sale, then you most likely won’t be disappointed.\n\nCurrently free on microsoft store if u have amazon prime btw\n\nSo you are telling me i can make amazon prime trial acc for free and get the game permanently?\n\nAt the moment yeah\n\nNvm it was only for April, its no longer in prime gaming\n\nEdit it’s until 15th may\n\nIs it not? The xbox one said it expires 15 may\n\nI picked up fo4 again since the show - lots of stuff I missed back in 2017 - waiting for 76 to go on sale to try it out\n\nCheck Prime gaming if you have it, they were having a sale on it right after the show came out. Don't know if it is still there or not.\n\nIt was free, in fact!\n\nit has improved massively, and it's not the janky, broken stuff it used to be.\n\nHowever, if i may, i still find it a completely pointless game to play, with plenty of mechanics that are implemented either terribly or simply don't fit too well an always-online, forced coop/semi-pvp experience.\n\nNeeds an image of Phil Spencer shopped over George Bush being told about 9/11 lol\n\n[Little messy, but I tried](https://imgur.com/a/Gd8B6Th)\n\nDo it after the 2nd one hits for authenticity\n\nHere you go https://imgur.com/a/jUfcFY3\n\nmr president, a second nuke just hit the settlement\n\nInstead of reading to kids he’s reading another layoff speech\n\nThat's pretty funny, ngl.\n\nAs retaliation, Phil will now be permenantly shutting down the servers for Fallout 76.\n\nThe guy from Location, Location, Location?\n\nWar, war never changes.\n\nLmaooooooo\n\nImmediate ban from all xbox services incoming.\n\nNothing will compare to Lord British getting assassinated at his own event in UO. lol.\n\nWell this made me chuckle\n\nI guess now we know someone from Tango also plays 76.\n\nI thought that said Phil Spector and was VERY confused.\n\nThat's probably the least surprising thing since launch\n\nthey nuked him because he simply waved at them and walked away “ all high and mighty “ lol\n\nHe will shut down the studio for this game because of that now.\n\nKeep blowing it up until he complains on twitter\n\nWait. If I play online in FO76, people can just destroy my camp? If so, and if I ever feel like trying it, I guess I'm playing offline. I ain't got time for my work to be ruined while I'm afraid or just chilling and creating stuff.\n\nIt's not that easy. The only way to destroy a camp (without glitches) is to do a dungeon and launch a nuke. And when you do that, it gives a server-wide notice and then a countdown, giving you ample time to either move your camp, swap to a different camp, or simply hop servers. Additionally, once you reach a certain point, you likely have the materials to repair the whole camp (outside of potentially crops), which can be done in a single action from your indestructible CAMP device. But realistically, the average player won't experience this unless they place their camp in one of like 4 or 5 very specific locations that get nuked to either spawn a boss, or farm enemies and materials.\n\nAlso, 76 is exclusively online. You can play on a private (but still online) world, but it requires shelling out for a paid subscription.\n\nEdit: To further clarify, your camp only exists when you are online, and only for the server you are online on. It's not like Rust or something where you put in a lot of time and energy and then get punished for having things like a job or family with everything you own being burned to the ground while you're gone.\n\nSo if getting nuked you can just go offline and nothing will happen?\n\nYes, if you just quit to the main menu you would be good.\n\nso anyone that gets nuked pretty much let it happen?\n\nYeah. Or you can just swap your camp. The game gives you two camp slots from the start. If you are getting nuked you can just freely deactivate that camp by activating your second.\n\nJust started fallout 76 today. How do you change servers?\n\nOn the map screen bring up the team menu on the right, you can scroll up to your name and give  you an option to leave the world. Basically anything that takes you back to the main menu will cause you to join a new server\n\nSo this implies Phil Spencer was actually playing Fallout 76 actively? - Didn't just have a PR intern or wwhoever set up a quick static base for him to show support of Microsofts big Bethesda purchase?\n\nThey can’t actually destroy it, you just repair it with a few scraps that’s all. A VERY minor inconvenience\n\nIs not that bad you just hit repair and all the junk you have the base just come back as it's a template.\n\nDon't think you can play offline but I may be wrong. You can however pay for a private server if you're that desperate to not be fucked with\n\nYou’re correct, no offline play\n\nLol it's an online game. You can't play offline. There's private servers but you gotta pay for that\n\nNobody will care enough to destroy a randoms camp\n\nWho is that\n\nAs someone who loves everything from FO1 through FO4 how is 76? I’m really a solo player. Is it possible or fun to play solo? How is VATS? Thanks!"

An air purifier would literally reduce not only how much of it deposits on things but also how much you breathe it. It's an incredibly sensible first aspect of cleaning.\n\nDo you have some asinine vision of a housewife with a bandana securing her hair, a feather duster in one hand and a can of pledge in the other, and anything other than that is just them lazy kids?\n\nI get allergies everywhere except my bedroom, my bedroom has a HEPA air filter. Best purchase I ever made.\n\nNow I'm seriously considering investing in one of those.  My room has more dust than the moon.\n\nI highly recommend it, the one I got is made by Priestley and I got it on Amazon for $100. Filters are $30 every six months or so.\n\nLol for real. I wipe down my consoles once a week with a microfiber cloth. Takes about one minute at most.\n\nCould also be a living dust devil inside that ate the hardware.\n\nMine has a problem reading the games. As i put in the CD game it doesn't read it or detect it. Any help?\n\n[deleted]\n\nEventually you’re gonna have the ps3 of Theseus\n\nPS3seus\n\nYou deserve more praise than you'll ever receive for this, but I see you funny man, I see you.\n\nThis actually made me howl. Maybe it shouldn't have been that funny but hot damn, the pun of the century\n\nSomeone get this man the golden upvote\n\nComments like these make it worth it scrolling through the threads instead of collapsing them.\n\nThis is even funnier for Koreans who don't call it P S. They just call it Ps. Like a snake hissing only with a P.\n\nThe [Plash Speed skit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEN00wMFB2A) also works in Korean because the substitution in Korean for words with the \"f\" phoneme (which doesn't exist in Korean) is to use the \"p\" phoneme (ㅍ).\n\nYou can die when I say you can die!\n\nNow let’s play new Vegas again\n\nCertain parts can't be replaced so the sun of the irreplaceable parts is what makes it the original ps3 it was at the factory.\n\nPS3 cyborg then.\n\n_The moment I discovered the weakness of my factory hardware.... it sickened me...._\n\nYou could start by cleaning the lens on the pickup with some windex and a microfiber cloth. I did that on my PS2 years ago and it never had issues again.\n\nNo windex!\n\nJust IPA. \n\nWhy would you use ammonia?\n\nJust jailbreak it and solve your issues :)\n\nCan't second this hard enough\n\nI've just jailbroken a wii (was all I had lying around sadly) and it's genuinely amazing what it can do. It can function as a one size fits all solution for console gaming (from previous generations that is), there are programs for it that run ps1/ps2 games, sega console games, handhelds, *everything.* thank you wii modding community. \n\nI'm about to go nuts with it and all the spare shit I have lying around. I have a 256gb ssd left over from modding my laptop, I'm going to use that for game storage and install apps on the SD card. Even got a cool clear shell for it because I have to replace the broken USB ports and that will require opening it anyway so may as well replace the shell while it's opened up. \n\nI find it extremely difficult to sit in my computer chair and play emulated console games for some reason, but it super hits on the couch, so jailbroken console is a massive lifestyle upgrade. So glad I did it, wasn't even that difficult\n\nI just installed almost a 1tb HDD on mine. It's a breeze to jailbreak it. At this point the most time consuming thing is using the PS3 web browser. I am constantly encouraging people to jailbreak it. Literally takes like 10 minutes if you follow the guide and are capable of understanding how to format a USB drive. \n\nA real shame games like Army of Two, Resistance series, Killzone 2 +3 and all the LBP games no longer have online. But still there's a great selection of games that do\n\nYeah lmao you can get $2 at gamestop for your outdated console or you can convert it into a priceless cross platform gaming machine. \n\nConsoles feel really inaccessible in that way to a lot of people, and I get it, but honestly it is really hard to fuck things up on the software side of things if you follow the guides, so as long as you don't try to fuck with the hardware you only stand to gain.\n\nI managed to mod my OG Xbox. But I couldn’t replace the HDD. I did so many things and bought countless hard drives from people’s recommendations. Never was able to expand the 8GB hard drive. Eventually just gave off and setting off a spark somehow inside the Xbox and it broke.\n\nIn the original Xbox, or Xbox 360 you could turn a dial in the disc drive to increase the intensity of the laser so that it could read disks consistently. But only test in 45° increments.  \nIf you rotate it all the way to the highest power you'll burn the disc\n\nPerhaps a good dusting once every few years, too\n\nPSU too\n\nClunks and small bangs are a handyman's favorite friend in most cases, since you know something broke, its probably visibly broken, and, while maybe proprietary, it's probably a pretty easy PnP replacement.\n\nIt's always when things just don't work for no reason that are a bitch. Because that usually doesn't mean something broke, it just means something isn't working *right*, and your problems can range anywhere from software errors, to bad connections, to smaller parts that might not even look broken at first glance.\n\npower supply\n\nYeah my money is on power supply, they make noise upon failure and OP said it won’t turn on\n\nThose slim models are notoriously bad PSUs. Def the power supply.\n\nPower supply could have also popped a capacitor. Still a relatively easy thing to repair\n\nDo not repair PSU capacitors unless you really know what you are doing. Just buy a new PSU (which I'm sure is what you meant, just making sure).\n\nThank you - hard drive seems to be working ok.  Might be the disc?\n\nClean the fucking thing dude. How can people even live like this? It’s beyond me.\n\nIt's probably a solid dust bunny inside, need to empty a can of air duster into that.\n\nAnd apply thermal paste too. I got my ps4 used and water damaged but I cleaned it out after a few years of use and tired of the jet engine sound and it works good as new quiet AF\n\nI know it isn't a normal thing, but canned duster can harm electronic components if the refrigerant liquid comes out, or it has a bitterant applied to it. I bought an electric air duster off of Amazon for my PC, and it was a crazy good investment.\n\nFirst rule with cans is to keep it upright, then the refrigerant won't come out. But I also got an electric one and swear by it.\n\nIf it looks that bad on the outside, imagine the inside.\n\n&gt;How can people even live like this?\n\nIt's a dusty PS3 lol\n\nThe question is, what does the system do when you turn it on? If you get the ribbon and it errors when trying to load a game, then try a downloaded game and if that runs it’s likely optical drive, if you get an error on boot, then it’s hdd or system failure, if it crashes after a few mins, cooling or psu.\n\nThe dust probably killed it at least try cleaning it up.\n\nThat's load-bearing dust at this point. The whole thing could collapse! /s\n\nStructural dust\n\nI just spent three full days cleaning up a remote shop for work in preparation for a new hire... load bearing dust, I like that and I can relate!\n\nPixie dust that powered the machine through two generations!\n\nLol\n\nHow do people let their shit get so dirty, and then post a pic for all to judge LOL\n\nThe internet constantly reminds me we weren’t all raised the same lmao\n\nYeah most of the time, it reminds me my parents did a pretty good job lmao\n\nHell I almost never dust and my shit isn't this dusty.\n\nIt’s the not even bothering to wipe it off before taking the pic and posting it on a public forum that gets me\n\nMaybe it’s like deoderant. Many cultures apparently have no concept of using deodorant or antiperspirants, and the body oder there designed to cover up is not really considered. So maybe he comes from a natural dusty place \n\nI’ll happily take a picture like this over one with somebody’s dirty feet peeking in at the bottom.\n\nKeep yer filthy grippers to yerselves people.\n\nI'm more concerned by the fact that you call feet \"grippers\".\n\noh lawdy i'm grippin'\n\nJudging by how it looks, but this is very likely.\n\nTwist: controller is the white model\n\nIs it really a twist though?\n\nSo he needs to de_dust it?\n\nYeah the controller could use a de_dust too\n\nEntirely possible they've had this in storage and decided they could get reddit karma out of it\n\nThat's my guess. The surface under the console isn't dusty at all.\n\nOnly somewhat related, but last year I got my friend a PS3 from a flea market (so he could play MGS4).\n\nThey were running that sucker on the gravel, so before I brought it to him I took it apart and cleaned it, and man there was a ton of dust in there, though maybe not as much as you would think.\n\nAnyway, it's not super coherent or anything [but here are some pictures](https://imgur.com/a/YkvX5Oz) I took while cleaning it.\n\nI did confirm after cleaning it (and applying new thermal paste) that it was running at cooler temps (through homebrew).\n\nAre you surprised? You didn't even bother to dust her, not even for a photo. I fear what is inside\n\nseriously, the shame i would feel posting something so dusty.\n\nI sometimes take a picture, realize the camera showed a little dust that I can't see with my eyes, and decide not to share it with anyone.\n\nI remember someone was showing off their apartment on here and they just had a mountain of dishes in the sink. They were getting kinda defensive about people pointing it out. I’m not the most organized or clean, but I at least know to clean up for others haha.\n\nPeople do it on purpose to get an influx of interaction…\n\nRight?!\n\nThe controller is actually white\n\nBet the controller was originally white\n\nRight?! F'n smokers\n\n*Lights a cig*\n\nWhen I was a kid in the '80s we kept our OG NES on the carpeted floor below the TV. Mom wouldn't move it to vacuum because it could erase our saved game if it got knocked while a certain cartridge was in there. One day it completely crapped the bed and Mom took it to a guy at the high school where she worked who \"knew about these things\". He took it apart and found a nest of baby spiders inside. He cleaned it up and fixed it. It worked great after that right up until it was stolen by my roommate when he skipped town in the early 2000s, took the 3O or so games that I had for it too. Fuck you James, I saved that NES and every game that went with it since I got it from my grandma as a gift for grading with an excellent report card going from primary to grade one. It literally feels like you stole from 6 year old me, while I was at the same time an adult. Well done, special feat. \n\n(Sorry reddit, My comment just spiraled in a way that I didn't mean for it to)\n\nspiders.\n\nthis is like posting a photo of a corpse in a ditch. give it some dignity, dude\n\nHave you tried cleaning it?\n\nI'm not sure he knows the meaning of the word by looking at it.\n\n\"Not since the financial crisis\"\n\n\"Jesus, you didn't clean it for over two years?\"\n\n\"No, the financial crisis of 2008\"\n\nWeirdly, the surface under the console isn't dusty. I call shenanigans.\n\nOr, you know, the pattern of the counter makes the dust hard to see. Also, the static electricity of the console will cause most dust to actually be attracted to the console than the counter.\n\nbasic maintainance should work just fine\n\nlooks like it was 2017 when you last cleaned that shit\n\nHas the thought ever crossed your mind to....well, you know ....clean it?\n\nU never wiped that shit down like once\n\nThat’s dust from like 2012\n\nDust older than my son\n\nHe got the pre COVID dust.\n\nSo will he get super powers if he licks it?\n\nHe’ll be immune to Covid and all variants\n\nLooks like he pulled it out from a tomb in Egypt\n\nMaybe he did and the sound he heard was the fuckin curse activating\n\nThe cause of PS3 death is visible in this picture. The inside probably has a dust bunny caked behind the fan.\n\na single dust bunny?\n\nthat thing is the Australia of dust bunnies\n\n&gt;a single dust bunny?\n\nYup, at this point. It absorbed all the little bunnies.\n\nOP getting fucking dusted in the comments.\n\nThat dusty thing lasted THIS long???\n\nthis post made me clean my pc. thanks OP\n\nThis has to be bait\n\nDied choking on a dust bunny 🐰\n\nHit it with a can of compressed air, both inside and definitely outside.\n\nGonna need a compressed tornado\n\nIt probably gave out because you never cleaned it or took care of it. That said, most likely fixable. New thermal paste or a new disc drive, or HDD.\n\nMaybe if you dusted her off once in a while goddamn 🤦🏻‍♂️\n\nIf you only dusted... like ever\n\nI have a feeling that the exhaust fan was probably clogged and died from overheating\n\nI think I can see the problem. You see, there's a spot of dust on the console. It's difficult to notice if you're not aware of it.\n\nDust-station. And no air flow. You have the console up against a wood wall so that shit is probably melted on the inside.\n\nI wonder what your cars health and inside looks like\n\nIf you open that thing up, I bet it looks like Leyndall, Ashen Capital in there xD\n\nI have an old one that works and I don't use. You want it?\n\nAnd not one of those hours spent cleaning it 😭\n\nHmm, it's probably clogged to shit with dust. Fuck man DUST\n\nI WONDER why it gave out? It's In pristine condition lol \n\nClean your console you fucking pig.\n\nJust open it up and look up a YouTube video to help you fix it.\n\nI'm about to try that myself.  Knocked mine over last week, and now when I turn it on, light turns green for a few seconds then shuts off.  Took it to a shop, they said $200-400 to fix.  Youtube it is.\n\nLooks dusty 👀\n\nF\n\nProbably choked with all that dust\n\nMaybe if you dusted her once and awhile she would of survived\n\nCringe op\n\nProbably all that dust!!\n\nBro gamers are nasty. Wipe down your console\n\nBro has never heard of dusting before\n\nSo sorry for your loss 🥲\n\nJust sprinkle crack on them\n\nUhhhh..... I doubt anyone would like to see the interior of the PS4 when the outside is already that dusty.  \nWay too much dust in the fans, and then BANG....\n\nMaybe you could have considered some cleaning along the way. If it looks like this on the outside, I dread seeing the inside.\n\nIt probs was a hard drive, just replace it\n\nI've never seen such a dirty Playstation. \n\nwhere do you live? Pompeii?\n\nwon’t be last person whos saying it’s hella dusty man😭😭😭 u should’ve clean it at least once in a lifetime\n\nClean it, then find out what's wrong, then repair it.\n\nDude why is it so dirty. At least clean it. Also it's probably fixable.\n\nGive it a proper burial bro\n\nRIP\n\nDied of dust over dose that poor fan tried it’s best\n\nPour more flour on it, that might do the trick.\n\nProlly choked out from all the dust.\n\nCause of death: dust explosion…\n\nLooks like you took good care of it too! /s\n\nYou seem to like it so much, yet let it get filthy. I bet it's dusty aaf inside. Weird post.\n\nProbably should've cleaned the thing\n\nYou should try cleaning the console for a change\n\nAnd none spent cleaning it\n\nI hope you wipe your ass more than you’ve wiped your PS3.\n\nIf it looks like that on the outside, I can’t imagine what it looks like on the inside\n\nWell it looks like it was cleaned regularly!, the dust probably destroyed the fan bearings, I wouldn't call this gave out since it is fixable\n\nProbably played like a PlayStation2 with the thermal \"insulation\"\n\nCouldve dusted it one in 15 years and it may have lasted longer\n\nMaybe if you dusted once a year\n\nJudging from the dust I’m guessing you never cleaned the fan\n\nDust is about 90% dead human skin. Please clean more often. A lot of people don’t realize your home can be more polluted than the outside world.\n\nRest in piece, old friend. 😔\n\nClean it! It's probably as dusty inside as it is on the photo!\n\nGiven how that system looks from the outside, it has to be filthy inside. Have you ever cleaned it?\n\nHave you never dusted or cleaned it?\n\nLooking at how dirty it is, probably gave out from all the gunk in it. 💀\n\nSell it online so someone can fix it. It's not like there's moving parts preventing the core system from working.\n\nThe hamster that spins the discs finally collapsed\n\n🫡 I hope you are in a cleaner place now\n\nDust her every once in a while.\n\nDid thanos snap its finger at it? The hells with so much dust? Lmao\n\nLmao “clunk” *death*\n\nIt’s so dusty, I thought this was a screenshot from the Last of Us\n\nRest in power\n\nNot even worth cleaning once? Sad\n\nBro that much dust will kill anything lmao it’s crazy how people because blind to dust\n\nDraw 25 or clean and maintain your consoles. Position its in looks like it's not able to ventilate properly either.\n\nLook after it next time\n\nHoly crap at least look after it, look at all that dust. Do some cleaning.\n\nCould be way more hours if you kept it clean\n\nLooking at how clean those tops are Vs the console, this has to be rage bait.\n\nYikes, if the outside looks like that. I can’t imagine what the inside looks like\n\nThat sounds like a hard drive failure, which would be super easy to fix.  There are guides on this sub for replacing it.\n\nTime to crack that baby open and fix it, to another 15 years.\n\nCouldn't give the old girl a wipe down at some point?\n\nBro is sandman\n\nI think it's still fixable. Try fixing it up? Maybe the fan?\n\nMine had a loud clunk a few years back. Changed the fan, works fine to this day.\n\n:D sheesh, i wonder what the inside looks like if the outside has this much dust\n\nMy condolences to you.\n\nEven the controller turned yellow after so many years attracting dust\n\nF\n\nLooks like one of the ps3 you'd find in the last of us\n\nDude didn't you ever think \"Hey maybe I should dust this thing, and entire area\"...\n\nRIP\n\nI've still got perfectly Well working PS2s from 20 years ago lol. Best console of all time.\n\n🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲\n\n🫡 rip 🪦"

Fucking love it everytime.   \nalso,  \n\"GONNA STING YA REAL GOOD\" (his stunlock special owned in 1v1)\n\nBOMBS AWAAAYYYY! From Loki is one I will also never forget.\n\n  \nBASS QUAKE!!\n\n  \nFantastic game.\n\nI still hear BASS QUAAAKE in my head every time I hear a car go by blasting it's subwoofer\n\nGonna sting ya real good.\n\nYes! This and twisted metal had such awesome backstories, Axel (the dude crucified between two giant wheels in the pic) sacrificed everything for revenge, he IS the machine.\n\nI really dug the anthology aspect to these games. At its best, it's the perfect mix between edgy and campy. (Twisted Metal 2 and Twisted Metal Black.) At its worst, it's so over the top that it's really fucking funny. (Twisted Metal 3)\n\nI think they teased him for season 2 of the TV series. I was pleasantly surprised at how fun that show was\n\nIt super was\n\nTerry Crews should play him.\n\nThey they did sweetooth was perfect. Alot nicer then in the games but they got the vibe right lol.\n\nVigilante 8: 2nd Offense for the Sega Dreamcast was the best vehicular combat game ever made.\n\nYeah, I said it.\n\nI had it for the N64, but I concur. That game was just so damn good for what it was!\n\nTime to roll the dice bro!\n\nWhat about Carmageddon?\n\nI still recall vividly turning into the stadium and driving straight down the line of scrimmage, mowing down an the players. 30 years ago?\n\nThe was THE BEST with the lightning power-up.\n\nThe Pedestrian elctro-bastard ray!\n\nDamn I felt like I was doing sth so wrong yet felt so good...\n\nCarmageddon was so much fun. Who doesn’t love listening to Iron Maiden and running over pedestrians\n\nI remember being so blown away by the car deformation in Carmageddon 2\n\nYou could literally bend a car in half and it would only drive in a circle\n\nIn 1998!\n\nWould LOVE a modern version\n\nA modern version was released in 2016, so you're in luck.\n\nAnd Road Rash.\n\nRoad Rash 64 was the best version and hilarious with it's crashes. Plus the whole overworld was intentionally fully explorable if you ignored the race to collect weapons in the most obtuse random locations while cruising around and having fun. Don't get me started on the Hyper bike class, it's everything at 300mph and slamming buildings while your body and bike fly through the air.\n\nRoad rash battle royale … someone somewhere making this? Would be epic\n\nCheck out Road Redemption on Steam. \n\nIt's very, very fun.\n\nThe sound track was awesome and the rap sheet at the end of races was great lol\n\nCheck out Road Redemption!\n\nVIGILANTE 8!!!!! That game was amazing\n\nIt was my favorite of the genre. The different combos to fire weapons differently was great. I loved the mortar cannon. I’d just fire off the big round and move onto the next weapon.\n\nYES the combos! The huge mortar round cratering the hell out of someone. The cannon was good too\n\nVIGILANTE 8: SECOND OFFENSE was even better\n\nMy sister and I used to love waiting in the Arizona map for 30 minutes and fighting the giant ant that would crash into the crater.\n\nAlso the n64 version had a better soundtrack than the CD music on the playstation or dreamcast and I don't understand why. :\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8KJiIVuKgA&amp;list=PLd01ydr_JtvLAN-R2zLqwJBHHx74jfikp&amp;index=6\n\nYou actually didn’t have to wait 30 minutes for the ant - you could destroy the motel building with a tower and that action would summon a meteor with the ant!!\n\nAs this thread goes i’ll quote my fav character:\nON TIME!\n\nI still remember the map where you are at one of the Apollo Launch pads at Kennedy Space Center in V8:2nd Offense\n\nThat was such a good game when we wanted to take a break from Gran Turismo 2 and just get silly\n\nsuch great memories of that game, they had incredible maps\n\nI loved 2nd offense. Thd story was whack but it was atleast kinda fluid. The garbageman and the cia car were the best fun to play\n\nInterstate 76, baby.\n\nThis game had some insane atmosphere.\n\n100% soundtrack. That game was fun to just zip around the map listening to the music. \n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjW0KYVZFFk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjW0KYVZFFk)\n\n\"Never get outta the car.\" SUPER DARK ending on that one.\n\nI'76 was close to the game I wanted with vehicular combat: Something with more simulation and \"realism\", something deep like Steve Jackson's Car Wars.\n\nHell yeah! That game was awesome!\n\nBest part right here\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjW0KYVZFFk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjW0KYVZFFk)\n\nRogue Trip\n\nThis!! Rogue Trip was the shit!\n\nI played it with my then fiance and now we've been married 23 years and counting. It's a part of our early dating.\n\nThat's awesome! I remember playing it with my big brother and with my childhood friends on PS1 as it was yesterday, and it's been more than 20 years. \n\nI'd looove a comeback of this game, but I think the fan base was never that big?\n\nGlad I'm not the only one that remembers this masterpiece.\n\nBig daddy 🎶\n\nI was all over Rogue Trip. such a great game.\n\nFuck yeah, bosstones on the soundtrack\n\nI credit that game with my discovery of and subsequent love for the whole Ska genre.\n\nI was chatting with a neighbor who became a good friend and we were talking about some of the punk shows we've been to. I asked him how he got into punk rock, he's like \"ummm. I guess it was tony hawks pro skater. I liked the music and started downloading it on kazaa. Then I started going to shows where I met all my friends. Holy shit... That video game changed my whole fucking life\".\n\nBro, twisted metal with rob zombie ost, goddamn our childhood was good. The guy on the XXL Segway in the screenshot was Axel if i remember correctly. And u had that special sauce code where u could get the big tank, think Minion was the name\n\n[removed]\n\nCel Damage as well\n\nThe HD remake they did was so bad. I miss that game but they changed some of the core mechanics for who knows why.\n\nAnd carmageddon.\n\nI miss Rogue Trip and Critical Depth. Also developed by the same people as Twisted Metal.\n\nRogue trip was the bomb, loved the way you unlocked extras in that game.\n\nI preferred v8 over TM, TM’s levels were too dark, too many jaggies to be that dark the visual noise was too much for me. \n\n\nTo answer OP’s question, I think the genre died out because of over saturation and the 90s were over and people were moving on to other things. \n\nThe real question is how come all the arcade racers died. I think the last one I played was Blur. All we have left is Mario kart and I’m sick of it.\n\nI love Burnout 3 to this day.\n\nAnd Crazy Taxi\n\nAnd Crusin' \n\nAnd Rush\n\nRC Pro-Am and Rock n Roll Racing\n\nOoh that's some good [nostalgia.](https://youtu.be/j8B4pZX0WSk?si=DY0UcbnnXldD8uQ5)\n\nseems like a no brainer for Twister Metal to make an online battle royale game.\n\nThat was the plan and Sony canned it before it got announced. The lack of a Twisted metal live service game with the show doing well is a sin!\n\nSony just doesn’t know how to run their business anymore\n\n*Sony sitting on several IP's not used in a decade.* \"We just need more original IP's\"\n\nI'd kick babies for a new, well made Killzone or Resistance. Or hell, Sucker Punch is around (albeit working on GoT2 I think) and I wouldn't mind another shot at the inFamous franchise despite Second Son being a rather poor showing. Hell, at this point I'll take a well done remake of the first 2 games.\n\nGuerilla games (devs who made killzone) have been doing the horizon series. That one is less Sony killing an IP and more the developers wanting to move on to something new\n\nKillzone with modern graphics would be incredible.\n\nYou have to admit, though, the combat in Second Son was polished AF. And having mimic powers where we can switch between different powers was beyond awesome. \n\nIts biggest detriment, (aside from the little impact the choices have in the overall story), was that the game was too short, and once you beat the game it's pretty much all over, which makes the last power set you gain utterly useless. \n\nWhat the franchise needed was a New Game+ mode where you're not locked out of certain powers because of your hero/villain status, and you can pick and choose abilities from both hero and villain subsets.\n\nThe regime of wanting every game to be a GaaS to milk that lootbox money are the ones saying that. The PS4 Sony regime that hoisted loads of excellent SP games onto the market would have a field day with all of the dormant IPs they have just lying in wait.\n\n\"We need more original IPs.... QUICK REMAKE THE LAST OF US AGAIN!\"\n\nThis is what confuses the hell out of me.  There's tons of IPs they could make a show out of but Twisted Metal has been dead for so long I've got no idea why they chose it.  And now they're filming Season 2 and there's still no new games or anything?  Like I could understand it if they wanted to revive the IP in a big way but like...  They aren't doing anything with it.\n\nThe show was supposed to release around the (*relative*) same time as the reboot, which was originally being developed by [Lucid Games](https://www.lucidgames.co.uk) (*developers of [Destruction All-Stars](https://youtu.be/6kP3G5vO49A?si=fU_OUT6ZXuQu53QM)*).\n\nHowever, PlayStation was unsatisfied with what Lucid had made, and so ended their partnership and brought the project in-house to be handled by one of their newly acquired studios, [Firesprite](https://firesprite.com), who up until that point were only really known for VR games like [The Persistence](https://youtu.be/YnSdwtEnIsM?si=RD6wu5XldjPCIHIh). At this point, development near enough started from scratch.\n\nLucid went on to work with Xbox as support developers for [Sea of Thieves](https://youtu.be/pNmUmQ5rJ80?si=5GhhHRlqxNTZ7JI9), but have since been acquired by Tencent. Not entirely sure what they're up to nowadays.\n\nFirespite had too much on their plate to handle Twisted Metal though, and so the project was cancelled for the second time. They're already working on a new horror IP for PlayStation and have suffered layoffs to boot. In the end, the game got cancelled before Firesprite had even really begun to work on it properly.\n\nSo, while the gaming side of things were falling apart, the show being made at Peacock was still chugging along. Sony clearly figured they may as well release it, because game development takes *years*, so there was now no chance of a Twisted Metal game releasing anytime soon. \n\nDespite no game being launched to capitalise on the hype, the show was still enough of a standalone success for Peacock to order a second season. That's how we've ended up with Twisted Metal being revived only as a TV show - the gaming half of the plan got scrapped, twice!\n\nAh, okay, that answers a lot.  They had planned to do exactly what you'd expect but that had fallen apart.  At least the show's doing well, I'm going to have to watch it.\n\nDidn’t Black have an online option? I didn’t have that add-on for PS2, but I think folks were using it for Resident Evil’s Outbreak series.\n\nIt did and they had sequels with Twisted Metal Heads On (PSP) and Twisted Metal on PS3 that had online. Sad we havent had a new entry since PS3.\n\nCan you imagine if they had pulled that off a few years ago when everyone was doing a battle royal game? \n\n\nIt would still do well now but would have crushed it back then. \n\nCheck out speed freeks! It’s a warhammer game that just came out that is orkz in cars blowing each other up. Has potential.\n\nI really liked the game, but since there are only a couple of game modes you do everything in the game pretty quickly.\n\nnobday remember Cel Damage? i played so much of that on my gamecube\n\nI was looking for this comment, that game was so amazing. I bought this randomly on a discount pile and ended up being my most played party game.\n\nYoooo i just played that the other day with a buddy! This shit is awesome. So many hours back in the day on it \n\nThe HD version does NOT hit the same tho :/\n\nTwisted Metal Black remastered please\n\nDude I just remember how dark that game was as a kid. Like every ending was like \"you got your wish, we saved your family from pain by executing them all\"\n\nWarthog in twisted metal 2 gave me bad dreams with his ending of having a young body but cursed with a 100 year old head. \n\nHowever the boxer in twisted metal black had my favorite line with his ending \"ya know, that was the first time I ever knocked someone out with one punch!\"\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjj-iD\\_YiGE&amp;ab\\_channel=Piecemeal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjj-iD_YiGE&amp;ab_channel=Piecemeal)  Here's all the endings so you can relive your trauma.  I remember beating it with Axel and thinking \"Well that was a weird fluke\" Then I beat it with spectre and sweet tooth before I realized every ending was just misery.\n\nThey're not all bad.\n\nBoxer guy with the stitched up face gets a boxing glove with surgical instruments and gets to kill the surgeon that stitched him up\n\nBloody Mary kind of finds herself and goes an Eat Pray Love roadtrip\n\nDollface also just accepts herself and rides off into the sunset.\n\nJunkyard Dog gets to kill that crop dusting pilot too\n\nRaven avenged her friend and became a protector of the innocent in Lost And agent Stone is able to save that family… although is left for dead on that rooftop.\n\nThe tech we have now could make a modern / remade game really fucking cool. TM:B already had some light effects that seemed ahead of their time. Ray tracing would probably look incredible\n\nWe can rebuild it. We have the technology\n\nYou can already see a small taste of what a modern TM would be with the PS3 Twisted Metal. It looks and plays fantastic, even if it was gutted and remains a shell of its original outings.\n\nThat game was fucking amazing. So much character.\n\nIf you have a gaming pc try Fumes demo: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1920430/FUMES/ \n\nIt's really good, i hope full game comes soon.\n\nCame here to recommend and link Fumes. Wish I could upvote more for visibility. Looking forward to this one big time!\n\nWhat the world needs is Interstate '77!\n\nThe soundtrack for Interstate 76 was awesome.\n\nThe pc discs worked as CD's so I'd bring nitro riders with me in the car, got some weird looks taking that one out on drives\n\nInterstate 76 was the only car combat game I loved. Most of the others were just silly \"blow your friends up\" multiplayer focused games. I76 had a fun campaign, lots of customization, deeper combat and perfect aesthetics and music.\n\nIt's just one of those games you know will never come back though, or even get a remaster. Very sad.\n\nAnd the poetry, man, the POETRY.\n\nHey Stampede, how bout a poem?\n\nImagine a car combat game with dedicate poetry keybind. Ah.\n\nThe fact that it’s been 25 years without an interstate game proves that we have angered the gods.\n\nAlso if they made a new game with the same time gap, it would be Interstate ‘03.\n\nDon't be ridiculous. It was only.... fuck\n\nIt's sequels are officially interstate '82, and vigilante 8.\n\nNetmech and Interstate 76. Activision heydey\n\nOh man memory unlocked.\n\nOh my God, I got that giant force feedback Sidewinder joystick with that game and it was AMAZING!\n\nI used to use the I76 CD while playing Tribes.  Each map would cue up a different funky track.\n\nTwisted Metal 2 was epic. The first one was also really good. Hands down my favorite games on PS1.\n\nI still remember getting to the pool room in one of the levels, paris i think\n\nThe rooftops? That was like new york. There was a statue of Liberty out there too. If you shot at her her clothes would blow off revealing a bikini\n\nTM2 was peak.\n\nMultiplayer together or vs, taking on sweet tooth, using the secret freeze shot with Thumper to line up a burn, low health fast Grim getting off a spinning special shot for big damage, good times.\n\nCheck Out Speed Freeks\n\nWaaaaaaaghhhhh!\n\nDAKKA DAKKA DAKKA\n\nThis where we krumpin’ boyz?\n\nIt's a f2p game, right? How's the monetization? I tend to avoid those just based on how egregious the monetization can be\n\nMonetization is a purely optional battle pass that is completely ignorable if you choose. I 100% recommend the game\n\nCosmetics and battle pass. The battle pass has a couple new vehicles in it not sure what happens when the BP ends. But I haven’t felt lacking or out gunned using the vehicles you can unlock normally .\n\nOnly vehicle in the BP is the rocket bike and you can get that without the BP\n\nBoth vehicles are free. You need to unlock them. You get the Grot Mega  tank after a good amount of close combat kills and you get the Megatrakk Scrapjet after 500 kills.\n\nCame here to say this.\n\nIt’s not the same but Wreckfest is a damn good time. Not guns but it’s great. Especially with mods :)\n\nCtrl+F Wreckfest \n\nAbsolutely.\n\nSomebody else suggested they add guns, but frig, the physics are hazardous enough.\n\nAbsolutely. Great to to jump in quickly and just blast out some vehicular carnage madness\n\nIt seems like something next-gen tech could make really cool.\n\nImage more realistic-looking damage on the crazy Twisted Metal vehicles.\n\nRemember how you could blow up the Eiffel Tower? Imagine that on PS5 tech.\n\nThe explosions, man! We could have so many explosions!\n\nBlowing up the Eiffel Tower felt so special back in the day.\n\nIt was cool back then how a map would kinda get reshaped during the chaos of a game. I can only imagine how cool it could be now\n\nThe destructive reshaping of the map was my favorite aspect of Battlefield before EA sucked that IP dry.\n\nPvP BeamNG.drive\n\nYou'd have to daisy chain a bunch of PS5s like the Air Force did PS3s back in the day. That shit beats up heavy rigs.\n\nCarmageddon was the GOAT\n\nCarmageddon 2 was one of my first \"real\" pc games. Played the ever loving shit out of that. Iron maiden forever in my head because of it.\n\nThat game is a core memory, the way you could deform and mangle those cars was unlike anything else at the time\n\nAnd holding the backspace button and all the metal slowly uncrushed itself (chef’s kiss)\n\nI loved carmageddon 2. I also played 3. \n\nI love driving around the world killing pedestrians and getting power ups. Then sometimes I would randomly lose and get reminded that it's actually a racing game. I always win through killing the other cars and never do the races.\n\nKilling pedestrians was so fun back then. I was laughing so hard. I wonder if I would get the same kick out of it, probably not.\n\nMy brother came home from his first semester of college in fall '97 and introduced 8th grade me to South Park, this, and software piracy. it was a good year.\n\nThe only game that i ever bought off google play. Game is so good\n\nRace, or just kill everyone and do laps later.\n\nIt also introduced me to Fear Factory\n\nThere's been a few attempts at similar over the past decade, but they all fall flat on their face and fail. So I think the industry has just formed the opinion that there is no point in making vehicular combat games that aren't Twisted Metal. As for why there's no Twisted Metal revival on the horizon? No idea. I was hopeful that when the show was announced it would come alongside a new game, but nope. I've given up hope at this point lol.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics are dated and the industry hasn't figured out a way to modernize it.\n\nI downloaded twisted metal black a few months ago. I was really pumped because I remember it being awesome. \n\nIt’s not. This style really didn’t age well.\n\nAlso, playing as kids, with your friends, you were all always kinda dogshit, or at least at the same level. All tactics were viable, all weapons and styles were viable across most multiplayer games, aside from big things like Odd Job being shorter in Goldeneye. Shit was fun because no one ever dominated and made the rest of you want to stop playing.\n\nNow? You play online, you're constantly going up against people blatantly above or below you, and the internet metagames everything to death with \"meta builds\" and \"tier rankings\" of weapons which makes everyone desperatly care if something is too good or too bad.\n\nI read weapon tier lists for games I played on the PS3 wayyyy before I participated in online communities and over half of my favorite weapons were in the \"complete dogshit\" level. Today you've got everyone sweatily centering around 1 weapon making every game cuthroat and high stakes. It's not fun, and if the gameplay can't be \"meta'd\" out, people won't play today.\n\nFor a long time when I got a game I would start looking up stuff immediately.  I realized how silly that is and have stopped doing it, but instant access to guides has definitely changed how video games are interacted with.\n\nThey tried a revival in 2012 and the reviews were middling and sales seemed bad.\n\n[deleted]\n\nThat's a good point. Especially since GTA 5 has multiplayer where you can literally buy flying motorcycles that shoot missiles.\n\nI always played battletanx\n\nBattletanx was great.\n\nBattletanx is one of my favorite all time games. Theme song immediately booted up in my brain when I saw your comment lol.\n\nThe campaigns of those games were one big fever dream lol.\n\nPlayed global Assault hundreds of times it was one of the only games I had for N64 permanently. I always look for it on the Nintendo switch store but it's never on there.\n\nPeople would be hardcore simping over Queenlords\n\nI miss that game. \n\nCame to this comment thread looking for Battletanx \n\nIncredible game\n\nWasn't there literally a Warhammer vehicle combat game that was released like a month ago??\n\ntheres a 40k vehicular combat game that just came out and is free to play\n\nAnyone Rogue Trip: Vacation 2012?\n\n  \nEdit: Typo fix. So many Rogue Trip enjoyers. Love it!\n\nThe unofficial Twisted Metal sequel. IIRC the original devs lost the license and made Rogue trip instead. Loved thta game.\n\nSuch a fun game - my siblings and I spent many hours playing the multiplayer.\n\nRogue Trip!!!\n\nThats what I was looking for!\n\n\"I love the smell of anthrax in the morning \"\n\n\nIt was our most favorite game, my friends and I played it way more than vigilante 8\n\nHad an awesome soundtrack too\n\nMad Max is a great game\n\nI feel like Jak-X was the end of that genre.\n\nJak-X wasn't even a bad game either, was actually a very good combat racer.\n\nI scrolled way too far to find someone bringing up Jak X that game is still fun to play.\n\nWho else remembers destruction derby? Great couple games release under this title\n\nHow am I expected to dig through these ditches and burn through these witches if there's no game where I can slam in the back of my dragula\n\nCan I get a DEMOLITION DERBY?!?!?!?\n\n\nNot \"vehicle combat\" per se, but one of the reasons I bought a PS way back when. The main reason was Battle Arena Toshinden (spelling?).\n\nwreckfest is pretty fun, and there is an online multiplayer mod for beamNG drive.\n\nWarhammer 40k speedfreeks. You’re welcome\n\nTry crossout?\n\nWhile i like crossout and play it from time to time the grind in that game really kills it for me. I firmly believe you have to spend money in that game to actually enjoy it in a timely manner.\n\nCrossout is so cool, but completely ruined by the free to play bullshit.\n\nLove having matches filled 70% with bot fodder that will drive up point blank and suicide rocket you every match.\n\nI wanted to love Crossout but that shit is too painful\n\nit used to be a lot better, but the more stuff they add, the grindier it seems to get.\n\nPeak Crossout was 4-5 years ago before they added the battle pass\n\nFun game, awful grind\n\nSurprised it’s still even a little alive\n\nI played twisted metal 2 so much when I was just a child in elementary/middle school, that I still have the God Mode code memorized.\n\nHold all L and R buttons and press Up down left right right left down up.\n\nI'm 35 now.\n\nWas a game called Motor Mayhem which was a 'sci fi' vehicle combat game that I loved as a kid.\n\nNeed a new twisted metal and a new Quake.\n\nA remaster  of destruction derby for the N64 please\n\nI miss Interstate 76.\nThe vibe, the music...\n\ncheck out speed freeks\n\nCarmageddon 2 was my shit back in the late 90's\n\nTM black was goat the art style and stories was a masterpiece.\n\n\nI really wish they would have continued with that \n\nFull auto was awesome\n\nStreets of Sim City way ahead of it's time\n\nCrossout is there and super alive\n\nI loved Carmageddon and Interstate 76. I was a PC kid so didn't get to play they golden era of Twisted Metal."

Majority of development to have taken place in Skövde (at least 50% before release)\n\n3. Original idea\n\nit doesn't get more original than a goat simulator!\n\nwhat do they put in Swedish water? Game-dev juice?\n\nin the 80-90s people could buy computers tax free via there employer. these machines were max spec offerings. often times built by mom and pop shops.\n\nthis means most households had computers that could play video games. if you were poor you had a friend or maybe your grandparents etc. had a computer you could play games on. now you just need to figure out how to do it since early games weren't that easy to get running.\n\nif you parents refused to buy you a console since you had the PC at home you better learn quick.\n\nAs an aside, people don't realize that there was a hesitation/[fear of computers](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GY2SaW1bMAAdSnD?format=png&amp;name=small) back in the late 70s and 80s. The conversation is much like today, people were afraid of losing their jobs to automation.  \n   \n* 1977 Apple II + TRS-80 (millions++ sold, home PC revolution)    \n* 1977 Star Wars (popularized technology)      \n* 1977 Close Encounters of the Third Kind (popularized technology)    \n   \nImagine how foreign the concept of \"sitting in front of a computer for 8 hours\" as your work would have been back then. People are often always resistant to changing habits.\n\nEhhh, we had George Jetson showing us how we were just going to be button pushers in the future.\n\nIt sounds great in theory, unless we still have capitalism at that point, in which case corporate will still quota the shit out of button pushing, like \"You have to push 14,400 buttons an hour, or you're fired\"\n\nWe're all stanleys pushing our buttons.\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Imagine how foreign the concept of “sitting in front of a computer for 8 hours” as your work would have been back then. People are often always resistant to changing habits.\n\nTbf tons of people already sat by a desk and did paperwork for 8 hours either shuffling paper by hand or using typewriters.\n\nCommodore was big in Nordic countries, a lot of devs have C64 and Amiga roots.\n\n[deleted]\n\nin 1990 VAT was set at 25%. so you could get a lot more computer for your money. since it was your employer that said who you could buy these tax free computers from (the cost would be taken out from your paycheck) the best way for these mom and pop shop to earn more money was to only offering top end systems since the employer would shop around so couldn't just charge a premium over big box stores to earn more cash. but you could only offer expensive system cut your margins a tiny bit to be the cheapest and still earn more since they are spending more.\n\nso it was a mix of high VAT, buy now pay later (interest free during an era of high interest). i was a kid at the time so i could be wrong but i do think the money taken out was before your paycheck taxes so it was a double whammy of tax savings.\n\n~20%\n\nI believe moms was 25% back then too.\n\nThat's how my parents bought our first computer, I have fond memories of playing Age of Empires on our old Windows 95 with a 2GB hard drive lol.\n\nOur government used to be very left leaning and in the 50s 60s and 70s they started up massive arts programs in music and such.\n\nThis lead to Sweden punching way above its weight in terms of culture and arts.\n\nYeah, it's not just games. A handful of bands we've all heard of are Swedish. Not a huge number, but for a place with 10 million people, way more than you'd expect.\n\nMax Martin literally made modern pop music what it is today.\n\nThis on top of Abba, Avicii, Europe (the band), Basshunter, Ghost, Sabaton.\n\nWhen it comes to music we fuck.\n\nDon't forget Roxette, Yngwie Malmsteen, Ace Of Base, Robyn and Electric Banana Band.\n\nNot to mention all the metal bands.\n\nFuck yeah. I grew up in the neighborhood where Bathory was formed, and we basically helped create death and black metal. Dissection, Dismembered, Grave, Entombed... and one of the most influential guitarists of all time: Yngwie Malmsteen.\n\nBack in the early 00’s, I was hanging out on message boards and mIRC (hah) chatting with 3d art community. One of the dudes was from Sweden and he got me hooked on At The Gates, In Flames, Dark Tranquillity, The Haunted.\nAs a young Australian kid back then thinking “holy shit this is awesome, but these bands would never come here”.\n\nSo much good music comes out of Sweden.\n\nHaving played V rising, Valheim and Raft for hundreds of hours. They definetly know how to make games over at Skövde\n\nInternet is pretty cheap there, and it's always been the spiritual home of piracy, so a lot of people have had a very vast experience of games, no matter their income. By proxy this also lead a lot of people to get a lot of basic troubleshooting experience very early on, which helps a lot with game dev, since everything after the initial idea is pretty much troubleshooting a problem until you eventually release something. Or in the case of goat sim, creating problems and making a game around them.\n\nIts easier to take risks if your country has a good social safety net.\n\nI'm guessing they're pretty liberal with the interpretation of the third criteria but that's alright.\n\nProbably mean not remake, 1 to 1 clone.\n\nProbably means original IP...\n\nThis is what I would think. They don't want to make a plaque for Call of Duty or the like.\n\nAll these games had a pretty big impact and you don't get that with a rehash of an existing idea. I think these games all can be considered \"original idea\"\n\nHuh, TIL that the creator of Satisfactory also made Goat Simulator. Quite the evolution!\n\nCoffee Stain is also the publisher of Valheim and Deep Rock Galactic.\n\nDID I HEAR A ROCK AND STONE?\n\nRock and Stone brotha\n\nIF YOU DONT ROCK AND STONE YOU AINT COMING HOME\n\nRock and stone to the bone!\n\nROCK. AND. STONE.\n\nLIKE THAT! ROCK AND STONE!!!\n\nROCKETY ROCK AND...Hey.. Wait.. They.. They banned /u/wanderingdwarfminer! He's not here! Those bastards!\n\nRock and Stone!!\n\nCome on guys, ROCK AND STONE!\n\nSTONE AND ROCK! oh wait\n\nYesterday I legit dreamt of something random happening near dunes, I fell into one, I uncovered a big round gold nugget. pulled out my ping machine and just spammed. Every person I was talking to turned into dwarfs and did the same. That moment, was happy just for 2 mins.\n\nAnd I barely played DRG to be honest\n\nThere's nothing like standing around with a full squad and just pinging native fungi. \"Mushroom. Mushroom. MUSHroom\"\n\nMe and my friends all suck at the game, so when we play it's more a cacophony of \"Help\", \"Bastards got me\", \"I'm down\", \"Don't leave me\"...\n\nYeah Coffe Stains Publishing also published all does game but ONLY Coffe Stains Studio made Satisfactory they are diferent people\n\nIirc they made goat simulator 1 as well\n\nI have soooo many Coffee Stain games\n\nAAA studios have nothing on game gems developed under smaller studios.  There is too much genuine charm\n\nYea I always thought it funny how this small studio made goat simulator and now publishes some of the most beloved videogames on the market.\n\nAnd then big publishers spend $600m on a shit game.\n\n\n&gt;And then big publishers spend $600m on a shit game.\n\n*Star Wars Outlaws has glitched into the chat*\n\nAs a Dane I feel obligated to say that the developers of deep rock galactic are Danes\n\nStellar record\n\nMaking Karl Proud!\n\nI was going to point out that this relationship combination has accounted for like 600 hours of my life.\n\nInsane that coffee stain also published those games.\n\nYeah, I hear that bit of fact surprising for many, obviously so as the games are quite different. :p\n\nShould be noted as well that before Goat Simulator, Coffee Stain made the First-person Tower-Defense game ‘Sanctum’. Some people know about that game. ;)\n\nAlso, Coffee Stain is quite big now in Sweden and have, afaik, several development teams (in cities Skövde, Malmö, Stockholm), though it all started in Skövde.\n\nYeah, Skövde has been fantastic in leveraging the games educations in the town and the officials do deserve some credit for giving opportunities tl these (and more) very talented studios\n\nYeah, I remember when they started their \"Video game programe\" at \"Högskolan i Skövde (I don't know if there's an english translation to this, but in Sweden \"University\" is \"above\" \"Högskola\"/College. University is a special status and you have to do research in at least two fields to become a University although both Chalmers and KTH still have Högskola in their Swedish names, they both have \"University\" status. But i digress) people kind of mocked them for it being a weak atempts at bringing students to a C-tier College in a small town where nobody wants to live. \n\nI think they have proven their critics wrong by now.\n\nAlthough often used interchangeably in English, College and University mean the same thing as they do in Swedish.\n\nA University is a larger institution, often made up of several colleges that focus on different fields (College of Arts and Sciences, College of Business, College of Health and Human Services, etc.) and often have both undergraduate and graduate degrees.\n\nMeanwhile there are smaller schools that are colleges, and not universities. These are usually either a) Religious Schools, b) Specialized programs, or c) Private Liberal Arts schools, or d) Community Colleges.\n\nSo for example, Nightingale College, which is a Nursing school. \nOberlin College which is a private liberal arts college,  Kenyon College which is a religious school, or any number of community colleges.\n\nOh wow really didn't know that, I loved Sanctum, haven't played it in ages\n\nYeah hopefully they will make a sequel. Great idea, ok execution. Still a blast.\n\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/210770/Sanctum_2/ \n\nI could also be dumb and its a totally different game\n\nI found 2 to be not quite as fun as 1 overall, personally. Still not bad\n\nWe need a sanctum 3... I secretly hope that the next thing is that or something similar, didn't found anything feeling like it for the past ten years :(\n\nThis! Give us Sanctum 3 pretty please 🙂\n\nSanctum was the shit back in the day. unfortunately I could never find people to play sanctum 2 with.\n\nSANCTUM IS THE BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nI loved Sanctum 2 so much... sadly my friends doesnt seem to share my love of Tower Defense.\n\nThere's actually a pretty obvious reference in Satisfactory that you may have missed, in the awesome shop there are music tapes you can buy, and one of them is from goat simulator.\n\nYeah, and ADA makes some comment about it being the height of culture or something like that. Love ADA.\n\nThere's also one you can find deep in a cave that's Deep Rock Galactic music, I thought it was just a random reference between indies until just now when I found out Coffee Stain published the game.\n\nIt's the same publisher, but not the same dev team/studio.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/8CilfQ1FeVg?si=urUcFUGYRSBRFkxk\n\nsanctum and goat sim 1 are the same studio (coffee stain) as satisfactory and share a bunch of devs. goat sim 3 is the one made by a different studio (coffee stain north).\n\nThe Goat Simulator soundtrack is in Satisfactory and you can listen to it on your boom box. It's my favourite factory music.\n\nThe reasons why you have goat music in satisfactory\n\nThey also made the Sanctum tower defence games which were decent\n\nThis the Indie game capital? thats a damn impressive lineup from a place with only 57k ppl.\n\n[deleted]\n\nMost bigger universities in Sweden don't actually have a game developer program. There are a couple of yrkeshögskolor (trade schools I guess?) like The Game Assembly in Malmö, but Högskolan i Skövde is an \"actual\" college. It looks like Stockholm university also has a program nowadays, not sure how good or popular it is though.\n\n&gt;  yrkeshögskolor (trade schools I guess?) \n\n*University of applied sciences* or *polytechnic* in English\n\nNah I'm pretty sure they just made that word up\n\n&gt; Dont really know the reason tho\n\nThe same reason that car dealerships tend to cluster together in the same part of town, why Hollywood is the film capitol of the US, and why Silicon Valley is a thing. \n\nA single business moves into an area, and attracts specialists in that area. The city develops a disproportionate number of that area specialists, which attracts other businesses of that same type since there is a larger pool of local specialists they need. 20 goto 10 over years and years, and you have specialized regions in a self-perpetuating cycle of 'the businesses are here because all the jobs are here because all the businesses are here'\n\nI live and work here as a dev and it's pretty amazing. The indie dev community is super tightly knit and there's a lot of city-sponsored resources for promising teams. Genuinely one of the best places I've lived.\n\nHej granne! :)\n\nHejsan! ♥️\n\nSå kallade övde\n\nThere are a ridiculous amount of developers in the small town, but it helps to understand that one of the biggest game dev universities in Sweden is there, so a lot of students team up at uni, and just stay there to finish development after they graduate. I went there for a game jam last summer, and the town is peppered with game references, so it feels more welcoming to gamers in general, like you won't be judged as much for liking games. That sense of comfort probably also entices devs to stay.\n\nDon't know if it's the same now, but back in the day when Stunlock and Coffee Stain were founded there was a pretty much a pipeline set up to get students to start studios.\n\n1.  There were three separate three year game development programs - Art, Design, and Programming - where the main focus were they yearly game project. People were spilt into groups and had to make a game (or often more like a vertical slice) over x number of weeks.\n2. The school also had a one year entrepreneurship program, where you could essentially start up a company and get college credit for it. If you have an already assembled team and a semi-presentable game prototype from your last year that would sure give you a leg up.\n3. Add to this a business incubator just across the train tracks from the school where a newly started business can get additional assistance and access to office space.\n4. Everybody mentioned above help in hosting a yearly developer conference (this year's wrapped up yesterday which I suspect has something to do with how this post came about) where projects and success stories can be highlighted.\n\nThere are bunch of different factors as well, like Coffee Stain using some of the money they made from Goat Simulator to help others get off the ground, but it only gets more intertwined and complicated as you go. Basically you have a bunch of people in both government and business recognizing an avenue for growth, setting them up for success and have it work out.\n\nYes, it’s SGC that I was talking about, like you suspected. :)\n\nInteresting. Like the Hollywood Walk of Fame, the Swedish Walk of Game!\n\nThat’s what I call my apartment hallway the next morning 😎🤓\n\nAfter a night spent gaming alone, right?\n\nFinally something Skövde can be proud of! 😉\n\nI lived there for a couple of years while studying. It's a nice place.\n\nIt’s one of the best cities i’ve lived in, but I’m biased as I’m a game dev so I get to interact with a lot of peers. :p\n\nYeah, I remember that högskolan in Skövde were big in game education back then as well (circa 2006).\n\nOh it still definitely is, and especially now as it is paired with the game incubator here to push students to create their own studios and games.\n\nThey are building up the Science Park next to the school with new buildings to house future developers as well. Really nice to see their intentions and progress focused on game development there.\n\nI grew up in the municipality next door (Götene) and Skövde was always seen as a shit hole, but after growing up you realize that it's actually pretty nice there\n\nBig words coming from Götene lol\n\nHaha that’s really funny. Glad it has improved then! :)\n\nI've been there to visit the military base (they use game engines in some of their training systems) and the most surprising thing was how to pronounce Skovde.\n\nSwedish pronunciation: [ˈɧœ̂vːdɛ] \n\n😅\n\nNow do Växjö and Gävle\n\nGerman and Nordic diacritics are a madness. A sound that's kinda close to ‘e’? Yeah, that'll be ‘ö’. And another one like that is ‘ä’. Something sounding like ‘o’? Draw ‘o’ on top of ‘a’, to get ‘å’.\n\nI'm convinced it's done just to confuse tourists, especially since the meaning of the diacritics varies between Nordic countries.\n\nDenmark and Norway also pulled a trick with ‘aa’ that's an alternative spelling for ‘å’. Since ‘å’ is at the end of the alphabet, if a word has ‘aa’ standing in for ‘å’, it has to be sorted after the rest of the alphabet. ‘Aardvark’ at the top, ‘Aarhus’ at the end.\n\nIf I ever want to mess with people I tell them there is a sentence in Swedish that goes \"å i ö i å\" .. Obviously not a sentence anyone would actually use, and it means river in an island in a river.\n\nI had no idea Skövde is the origin of these games! No wonder that town felt nice lol\n\nHave sunk hundreds of hours into Valheim. Love that game!\n\nSame here mate. It’s definitely my favourite “survival-crafting” game.\n\nI haven’t even gotten past the 4th boss or entered any of the new 2 regions and I have 280hours played. :p\n\n1500 hours here. currently on a no map no portal run.\n\nSome fun extra info:\n\nSome years ago the city did something similar and painted electrical boxes with some of the games made there. \n\n[Link](https://imgur.com/a/vx7faDp) to a couple of them, though I know there are more.\n\nV rising is fantastic. Hugely recommend. Loads of fun bosses, tonnes of content.\n\nIs it a game you can casually play solo or are you missing on some gameplay if you're not playing coop?\n\nEdit: thanks to everyone for their feedback\n\nI’ve played through it entirely as solo, both on normal and brutal difficulty.\n\nCoop is always more fun, but I don’t feel it is required at all. The last bosses are quite tough though, so if you’re not someone who likes to repeatedly fight the same boss to progress then it might not be as fun.\n\nMost bosses are generally a modest challenge, nothing crazy though if you stock up on consumes and have the best gear possible at that stage.\n\nThanks!\n\n\nI bought it after Space Marine 2 and Wukong.. and have more hours in it than those 2 combined 😬\n\nI’m probably around half way through the bosses. 50hrs and counting. It is a massive time sink, in the best way imo. \n\nSolo only. \n\nAbsolutely recommend!\n\nYou can’t pause, but you can save and exit - or chill in a safe spot. \n\nWould be annoying during a boss fight, but you can flee boss fights. But their health will regen when you come back.\n\nThanks!\n\nIMO it's a better experience solo.  The fights are all tuned to be soloable, even on brutal mode.  When you are in a group the bosses have more health and spawn more adds which can make it harder with a bad group.  Normal mode let's you use lots of different play styles but brutal mode felt like I really needed the defensive cd's.  \n\nNice thing is you don't have to choose.  You can play online and solo or group up if you need to or just for fun.\n\nI would absolutely recommend starting on normal mode first though.  Even having solo'd the entire game on normal, brutal still kicked my butt on several bosses.  I really had to tweak my skills and fine tune my strats for some brutal bosses.  Normal is still a solid challenge.\n\nIt’s a really fun game but I don’t enjoy the timed tactic where you have to login consistently (like once a day almost) to refill and maintain the thing (not being specific on purpose)\n\nThat is annoying at first but once your half way in you're so abundant of the resource needed you can top it up for weeks worth of time. There's also mods to remove the system completely too if your on your own hosted server.\n\nThe funny things, Ubisoft said recently that [\"solid games isn't enough when you have gamers expecting extraordinary experiences\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1frbv00/making_solid_games_isnt_enough_when_you_have/)\n\nbut the things is, here you have 5 games that will give you hundred of fun hours (thousand if you are hooked by satisfactory) and they are on the cheap side.\n\nthis mean gamer don't want extraordinary, but just good game, doesn't matter if your game has 500 bajillion budget, a bad game doesn't sell.\n\nYeah, I really disliked and didn’t agree with that statement they made. A game doesn’t need an insane budget or AAA fidelity graphics, and mostly need to do the things they set out for well or serve a niche while releasing at a good time. Marketing obviously matters, but that’s for the game to be seen and not necessarily to sell the consumer on the game’s details.\n\nTrue,\n\nthe way I read this statement, it's the gamer fault because they always want more and more, this couldn't be far from the true, for me, it's shareholder and CEO talking that don't have any clue what gamer need and want.\n\nI don’t think they are completely wrong, but more of blind to the indie side of development.\n\nOf course people have higher expectations of games made by a AAA developer that put millions of dollars into their development. Issue is that AAA developers can’t go bigger with every installment of a game and have to pick and choose what new thing to focus on.\n\nEverything isn’t as straight-forward as it seems, at least to me.\n\nI see what you mean, \n\nwe are more inclined to excuse an indie when there are some ruff edges on their game, if the game was made by like 1 or 2 peoples,\n\nbut on the other, if you tell us your game took 8 years and 200 millions budget, the very little mistake you make, will be pointed out, it's the same in the movie industries, car, PC part etc.\n\n  \nbut in this case specifically, they are saying is the gamer fault, which in some degree could be true, but they say that like they have nothing to do with it. \n\n(sorry for my english)\n\nUbisoft is just upset that they aren't making money off mediocre games in a highly competitive market. they are getting squeezed out of the market by people with actual fun ideas.\n\nLol people just wanted another AC Black Flag but got a steaming pile of shit instead. Ubisoft has no clue what people want.\n\nThats is so cool! I had no idea\n\nSo cool to see the city finally doing some more!\n\nI was born and raised in Skövde and could only dream of working with games since cool companies were in the big cities or abroad. \n\nI eventually go the honor to work at coffee stain :)\n\nApparently we need a “made in Skövde” filter for steam, because they are putting out bangers\n\nThat would be neat in general to have for games made in the same place!\n\nI know Steam have “Made in &lt;Country&gt;” sales so it would be cool to go further with that. :p\n\nRaft was soooooooo fantastic. The coop was the funnest there is. Hope for a sequel!\n\nthree of my favourite games of all time were made in the same city????\n\nhad no idea satisfactory and goat simulator where swedish games\n\nI own 4 outa 5 dayuum\n\nSame, currently loving 1.0 of Satisfactory\n\nV rising and valheim are some of my all time forever, simply perfect games. Raft is amazing even though it has short comings. I get Goat but im personally not a fan of playing it. I was waiting for 1.0 for Satisfactory and glad its finally here! Cant wait to have the time to play it.\n\nDoes Satisfactory have a story? Main objective as of 1.0?\n\nI believe the Satisfactory devs said they didn’t want to front-load a linear story into the game, but that you get like bits and pieces by playing it through exploring the world and continuing the main progression path.\n\nI have only played 1.0 for like 6 hours so far so I can’t really say. :p\n\nYay!\n\nIt makes me sad Stunlock is known for V Rising and not the beauty that was Bloodlines Champions and BattleRite\n\nHaha yeah, most people (mostly game devs that I talk to though) in Skövde know about Stunlock mainly from Battlerite. That was the first game I knew about from them as well.\n\nIt is their most ambitions and lucractive (afaik) title so far.\n\nStunlock &amp; Battlerite was also my first foray into game development, which was a great time (only for ~1 year though unfortunately).\n\nAhhh, so that’s where the name of my first in game train station came from (in Satisfactory)\n\nI knew the other names.\n\nOh? Please explain, as I have never reached trains in Satiafactory as I waited for 1.0 before going too far in EA. :p\n\nThe train stations are automatically named after cities. I also have Sydney and Kyiv. I didn’t recognize Skovde… thanks to this post, now I do!  Thank you for the education!\n\nHaha that’s fun. No problem! 🫡\n\nSweden makes some of the best games... Satisfactory, Valheim, Minecraft, Amnesia, Raft\n\nI still miss Stunlock's Battlerite. That game was great and there's been nothing quite like it. Would have thrived in a world where it had crossplay, I think.\n\n[deleted]\n\nOf course you are; here’s your Swedish pass, cinnamon bun, and IKEA catalogue! 🇸🇪\n\nCoffeeStain deserves all the love; i remember playing one of their first games made, Sanctum  \nThat series was amazing and no one ever talked about it\n\nMy friends and I decided to wait for Satisfactory to hit 1.0 before playing. It was as worth the wait.\n\nAlso, send help. This game has taken over our lives.\n\nI live in Skövde and it's always fun to tell people that these games were made like a 10min walk from my apartment\n\nHeard that the University of Skövde is a really good university for game dev\n\nWow, I didn't know Coffee Stain was founded in Sweden. For some reason I thought they were from UK\n\nThis is really nice\n\nGreat to see a country hand out small but awesome rewards for creators in the gaming industry\n\nThat’s cool. Reminds me of the lemmings statute in Dundee(?, Scotland)\n\nHoly shit most of these are within my favorites. I knew they were Swedish but I didn’t realize they also had the same city of development\n\nThat logo for \"Valhiem\" is one of the old logos of Western Washington University.\n\nGo valheim! Favorite game to grind in while I wait for updates. Also probably the one game that brought out my own interior decorator\n\nV rising for sure doesn't deserve that..\n\nAnd before you say anything i played their previous game which they neglected. Legit all the combat in vrising is copy pasted from battlerite slapped on a survival game.\n\nValheim at release is the most complete EA game i've ever played. I've sunk thousands of hours in it\n\nVALHEIM!!!!! BEST GAME EVER!!\n\nI feel this was a missed opportunity to make them QR codes that are direct to the respected games site for more information. All of them are amazing games and deserving of all the recognition!\n\nI support ideas like this, should be world wide. I would go to place like that, take a photo and visit mentioned studios with great pleasure and bring sweets with me :)\n\nOur own \"Hollywood walk of fame\" for video games around the world. Cool.\n\nSkövde is pumping out banger. Also had no idea Goat Sim, Satisfactory, and Deep Rock Galactic were all made by the same studio.\n\nDRG is made by a Danish studio though, but have Coffee Stain as publisher. Believe the developers are called Ghostship Games or something like that. :)\n\nI love Raft actually 😭\n\nI fucking love Raft and Valheim\n\nv rising was surprisingly good for me personally\n\ni would want to see a similar thing in Turkey\n\nAll of these games are incredible. Most of my time went into satisfactory and v rising\n\nThis is fucking awesome. What a delightful thing to do, and what a great way to show how quality these game logos are. \n\nawesome that the people behind goat simulator also made satisfactory\n\nValheim was pretty fun.  Good game for the explorer and the builder.\n\nValheim is fantastic. Wherever it was made SHOULD be proud of it\n\nCoffee Stain Studio is the goat, pun intended, but before Satisfactory 1.0 released they announced the price was going to increase to $40 from $30, but gave everyone an opportunity to buy it at $15 ahead of time before they made the change.\n\nProtect Skövde and its people at all costs!\n\nValheim and Raft are easily two of my favorite games in the last decade.\n\nGoat Simulator is Swedish? It makes more sense now.\n\nPerhaps because Skövde is also home to CSS.  ;-)\n\nCoffee Stain are one of my favorite developers and publishers.  They are involved in so many great projects.\n\nSome context: Skövde has a population of just over 57,000.  Incredible that this many bangers came from this one small town via multiple studios.\n\nThese games all slap. Do i love Swedish devs ?\n\nI wonder if Josh from let’s game it out would be a hero or villain in that town\n\nI really miss Battlerite...\n\nV Rising and Valheim are so much fun love them.\n\nWish more cities did stuff like this\n\nWow, some of my favorites from one place, well done Sweden\n\nhave all of these games, love em.\n\nValheim was perfect, in my opinion.  On my 7th play-through currently.\n\nI really liked Raft but I thought it was dumb you get the best material for crafting *after* beating the game.\n\nAwesome\n\nCan u paste a sticky note under the sign for raft?\n\nNote should say \"PLZ BRING GAME TO SWITCH!\"\n\nThanks\n\nHaha, unfortunately I currently don’t live in Skövde at the moment and I was just visiting, and i’m on a train away from the city now, so I can’t execute your request I’m afraid. 😔\n\nEdit: also these plaques are embedded into the street, so not sure I would be able to put something Under them. ;)\n\nOkay that's really damn cool"

    "all_comment_text": "Fun fact: The developers originally wanted to make a racing game and then got contracted to make Mafia so they built it on top of their racing game engine, and it absolutely shows in the completely unnecessarily detailed driving mechanics and in how much of the game actually consists of just driving around or being in car chases.\n\nFunny given how the studio head of the group making the new mafia game was the director of Split/Second\n\nDamn man, haven't though about Split/Second in soooo long. We had a blast on that game back in the day!\n\nIt's my favourite arcade racer, explosions, and crashing airplanes? Who needs more?\n\nIt was the one where the maps changed mid-race, right? Like a Ferry crashing into the Harbor, or a plane crashing on the track? That shit was FIRE\n\nYeah it was a dope game, I was so hyped for it at the time since a lot of the devs were previously on the Burnout series that I pre-ordered and everything. Still have the pre-order diecast car around here somewhere.\n\nThere was supposed to be a 2nd one but it got canceled. 😞 hurts to this day\n\nStill gutted the sequel got canned. First of the Disney f*ckovers, apparently while nearing the end of completion Eisner and co. at Disney decided that they were gonna pull funding for the next one and concentrate on different markets possibly mobile games or something. So the writing was sadly on the wall before the game was even on the shelf. Hence why the game also dropped at the same time as the first Red Dead Redemption also about the same time as Blur i think. Its such a shame because Split Second is frickin awesome and is still mine and my best friends goto game for an awesome time!\n\nSplit/Second was so cool\n\nThat’s actually fucking hilarious lol\n\nAnother fun fact: Watch Dogs, another open world video game that was originally supposed to be a racing game went through the same process. And it absolutely doesn't show because the driving in that game sucked dick\n\nPayday 2 is also built upon a racing engine which makes no fucking sense because that game definitely has the worst driving mechanics in all of gaming\n\nThere is driving in Payday 2?\n\nI'd compare it more to trying to ice skate on a watermelon but yeah it does.\n\nYea some of the heists have it\n\nCollisions in PD2 are very wack, that's why driving sucks. It shows how PD2 foundation was being FPS first, even if game engine was used first for racing. If anything - Diesel has more history of being more capable for being good for shooters: Terminator: Salvation, Wanted: Weapons of Fate, Ghost Recon Advanced Warfare 1 and 2 on PC and last two Bionic Commando games are using this engine.\n\nWatch Dogs was almost immediately after 'the Event' in around 2013 though. 'The Event' being the really weird moment when all but a handful of developers simultaneously forgot how to do good arcade driving physics seemingly overnight. 'Watch Dogs the racing game' having shit driving makes perfect sense for a 2014 arcade racing game.\n\nill never forgive that first watchdogs trailer for setting such unrealistic standards for what amounted to a very mediocre game\n\nApparently some mods unlock more of that and the game was supposed to be for ps4(?) but got moved up and downgraded.\n\nI still liked the game, though I played it recently by pirating it. Its a good series and much of what they warn about in terms of privacy invasion, police state,  and online manipulation seems to be happening or already happened.\n\n&gt;and much of what they warn about in terms of privacy invasion, police state, and online manipulation seems to be happening or already happened.\n\nYeah, IMO the series is an absolutely underrated possible prediction of how the future is likely to look like. Not the unrealistic parts like \"some guy presses a button on his phone to hack a gas pipe to explode just in the right second to blow up a police car\", but the general scenario of privacy invading government and corporations. Or the camera system that can fetch private information about people by just scanning their face. Also, especially in part 3 in London, ads pretty much everywhere they could fit them, animated screens on cars, and surveillance drones.\n\nI can't look into the future and determine how accurate it actually is, and I'm usually not that pessimistic about all of that, but I can still absolutely see all of that happen in a few decades.\n\nLoved the game and I don't consider it mediocre. It's actually pretty good!\n\nBut seeing the trailer is depressing. It looked SO good\n\nI'm completely uneducated on this as I was never big into racing games - be that arcade or sim racing.\n\nBut I recently got a FFB wheel and pedals, and was trying to play some newer (arcade and simcade) racing games on it and was shocked at how awful it felt. \n\nIs this a product of what you described and are there some pre 2013 arcade/simcade games I should try with my wheel, or did arcade games just always feel bad with a wheel and was a wheel only ever good for sim-racing?\n\nDont listen to that other guy Forza is notoriously awful feeling with a wheel. Look at Assetto Corsa, Wreckfest is okay the Dirt games are good and f1 games are solid too.\n\nFor newer games try Forza Horizon, they're awesome and you can fine tune the driving to your liking. For older arcade goodness try the Outrun series, I think you can find Coast 2 Coast, you can find a copy floating somewhere (not legally though, because of the Ferrari license).\n\nSports games underwent something the year after that too. EA started using a new engine, I want to say it was one of the frostbite ones maybe? And every single EA game from then on began to look and function the same, and they've all been absolutely terrible.\n\nAnother fun fact: Lord of the Rings: Return of the King for PS2 was built on a **golf** engine.\n\nOkay but in fairness, Bandobras Took (a Hobbit) invented golf during the Battle of Greenfield's according to Tolkien. \n\nSo there's actually a precedent for it!\n\nSo was Dead Space lol.\n\nSo was Virtual Hydlide, which really explains a lot about that heap.\n\nwow you had me in the first half like \"wtf is this person talking about the driving in Watchdogs was terrible\"\n\nAny driving in any Ubisoft game is god awful for some reason. Far Cry, Ghost Recon, WatchDogs all have terrible driving\n\nThe driving in the Mafia games is still my favorite feature in an open world game. The atmosphere was so dense for a game from that era due to that.\n\nWould love to see more games that try to approach driving from this angle, rather than only mildly simulating traffic. GTA with believable driving could be very cool, even if a tad more challenging.\n\nI fully completed Mafia 3 while respecting red lights and speed limits. Then I found out you shouldn't, because the cops in that don't care on the normal difficulty.\n\nI did that for the first two (well three with the definitive edition) games, so I get why you would have tried that.\n\nEspecially the second one really resonated with me, I think I even walked all places in which one could. Such a dense atmosphere. I still remember the introduction scene some 14 years later.\n\nI fully completed the second using the paper map only! Great experience.\n\nOh wow I didn't know that. I'm glad they went in a whole different direction.\n\nI didnt know that, but god damn was the driving great.\n\nThat’s wild. I used to ask the modding community for dedicated racing mods and was told off because “it’s a Mafia game and not a racing game - go play a racing game.”\n\nThat's so telling. I do believe it was the game that made me favor realistic driving to arcade driving\n\nThank god because that racing mission is awful\n\nMan, that race was fucking &gt;hard&lt;. But not unfairly so.\n\nOnce you nailed the driving, also incredibly fun and I did repeats just because of it. If you are into racing games, the sim aspect here was better then in some titles solely focused on driving.\n\nCars from 60s and older are waaaaaay harder than even the 70s-80s, in any proper sim game. 'Mafia' is set in the 30s, when tire grip was nonexistent, and pressing the gas just a bit too much meant spinning the car into the bushes.\n\nPersonally, I'm inflicting that on myself with Assetto Corsa — which is tame compared to ACC, for example. In fact, the Mafia racing track exists as a mod for AC, and it turns out to be pretty easy compared to real-life tracks.\n\n&gt; I did repeats\n\nA bit of a masochist, eh?\n\nthat would make anybody having liking for non arcade racing games a masochist.\n\nAs a sim Rally enjoyer, I may be a bit of a masochist. long live RBR\n\nAbsolutely hated that mission\n\nThe racing mission wasn't awful, the opponents are very easy to overtake it's just that the game has actual driving physics so you need to slow down for corners and be careful when exciting corners because you can easily spin out. As someone who regularly plays racing simulators the mission is incredibly easy but I can see why people had such difficulty with it when it came out as there simply weren't that many games with decent driving physics\n\nYea just played it since its on game pass, 3 tries on normal difficulty, while using manual transmission. Some annoyances by starting at the back and having some bad luck as cars in front went off and took me out, but totally doable.\n\nim of younger generation that didnt get to experience the game at the time, so played it recently and the mission isnt that bad, just due to racing being not arcade you need to consider basic vehicle dynamics to not jank your keyboard every turn, then just follow the racing line for an easy win. The mission is fine.\n\nEdit: i was playing the not-remaster game.\n\nI don't know how much of it is memory of annoyance, but remaster is much easier both on the setup timer and the race.\n\nI remember having to cheat the race by glitching a wrong way dead end, since there was no way to beat it outside pixel perfect driving.\n\nThey tweaked the remake. On lower difficulties it is straight up easier, but on the \"classic\" or whatever the harder difficulty is called they still fixed some quirks that make it behave better / more predictable.\n\nThat being said I was able to complete the original when it came out and I was terrible at driving games, so someone who actually is used to sim racing will probably find it pretty manageable even in the original.\n\nWeird, I had played quite a few racing games prior to mafia...but that racing mission made me quit the entire game because after countless tries it kept being unbeatable for me.\n\nIt was made easier in patch though. Most people complaining about the mission remember the actual original one.\n\nSimilarly, I played the original for the first time about five years ago and recall that race taking two attempts, first one to get accustomed to the racing and one to beat it.\n\nMafia got a patch not too long after release that adjusted the race. 1.0 racing was hella different from 1.1. I've played both and had to use a cheat trainer to get past the 1.0 version.1.1 was not that bad at all. Not sure if that one included a difficulty setting?\n\nOn the original, the mission was literally impossible if you had low end hardware/fps. I tried dozens of times and always spun out, then beat it first time when I upgraded my graphics card.\n\nIt's not awful, it's hard.\n\nThere's absolutely a difference. I was one of those people that had a full force-feedback wheel in the early 2000s and my goodness did that one mission give the actual racing games of the day a run for their money. Really great handling of 1930s Grand Prix type cars, unforgiving but rewarding when you got it right. It's taken years for anyone else to come out with a classic racing game that even comes close to touching what Mafia had bottled up.\n\nAnd it's just as awful in the remake too.\n\njust did it recently and its fine, took first place on the first lap and cruised to victory easily.\n\nthe issue with the mission is that the AI is terrible and you start right at the back of a race with only 3 laps, so you have to overtake 14 terrible AI drivers that seem to just blindly follow the racing line and are atrociously slow in some corners which can easily cause you to crash into them and ruin your race.\n\nI replayed the remake on the hardest difficulty and just couldn't get past that mission, insanely hard. Had to use speed hacks to make all the opponents crash and complete it that way lol.\n\n[this video really opened my eyes to that mission](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Baw3jzW8t-8)\n\nIt’s where I stopped playing the game.\n\nAnd the extended driving sections actually helped the immersion! By slowing the pace of the game instead of all action all the time. They completely got rid of that in the remaster and I missed it.\n\nAnd the game benefited greatly from it.\n\nIt did support racing wheels. Which is very silly for an action game.\n\nYou meant to say awesome right ?\n\nOnly as long as you're in a car.\n\nTry exiting a car and shooting someone with a steering wheel.\n\nDamn. I missed out.\n\nLol I didn't get what you mean at first, and so I imagined the main character exiting the car with the steering wheel still in the hands and just throwing it at someone, which creates an explosion\n\nAnd yet, the worst part of the game was the actual racing part.\n\nFunny enough it sucks horribly because the developers used a racing wheel to test it. Not thinking that 99.9% of their players would be using input devices with *way* less precision.\n\nI remember begging my grandmom for a racing wheel **just** to pass the in game race sections. (I think we went to a BestBuy?)\n\nSuch a niche situation, especially because I clearly wasn't aware of the games' development cycle as a younger, but Hell if I don't have forever memories there.\n\nI had a racing wheel and I thought it was great - I wanted a full 1930s racing game as a result!\n\nYou can in fact recreate the 30s to some extent with modern sim games and mods. It's horrible, in the best way. Tire grip is nonexistent, pressing the gas a bit too much sends you into the bushes. Turning requires acting half a kilometer in advance. On actual old tracks, turns are subtle so that you gotta measure degrees to not fly off. Nothing like barriers to stop you.\n\nYou can even have a race of about 70 km per lap with Targa Florio.\n\nFun fact: rally navigator announcements were invented by  Stirling Moss and his co-driver at Mille Miglia in 1955. With a 540 cm long paper scroll to serve as pace notes.\n\nComing from racing games I didn't mind it as much, that's not to say that I didn't need several tries for the racing mission but I found the shootouts with enemies having very good aim and two or three bullets killing you far more challenging.\n\nYeah I don't know how many hours I would have spent trying to pass that stupid race mission if my cousin hadn't told me about the shortcut.\n\nThe detailed driving mechanichs are the best point of the game, no game had anything similar.\n\nI spent a ton of time in racing games like Grand Prix 3/4 back in those days but the release version of that racing mission still took some tries - and for all the wrong reasons.\n\nI spent several hours on this race. As a result, I passed it, and then a patch came out that added the ability to change the difficulty of the race. I felt cheated :)\n\nfunny because the race mission was the hardest in the whole game\n\nbefore it was patched up, if you took corners too sharply in that vehicle you'd topple over and break your neck\n\nto be honest i felt this was waaaay ahead of its time  \nthis was released only 1 year after gta 3, to put things in perspective\n\nIt really was ahead of its time in details. The open world was more or less just a backdrop for the setting and there was not much to do in it so in that sense it was limited, but so many gameplay mechanics were incredibly detailed.\n\n\nOf the top of my head:\n- Extensive damage models to cars with individually breakable windows.\n- Cars have a gas meter and could run out of gas. You could refill them at gas stations.\n- Bullets or clips ejected from a gun didn't disappear.\n- When reloading a gun with a clip you lost the bullets in the ejected clip, while reloading guns with individual bullets didn't have this issue.\n\n\nThere is probably a ton more but it is incredible how much detail they put in there in 2002!\n\nEnforced speed limits and red light stops as well\n\n[deleted]\n\nIn Mafia, running a red light or a stop sign can end in a chase too, but you could immediately stop and just pay the fine.\n\nWhich had no other consequences than taking some of your time since the game had no currency system. That is hilarious in hindsight.\n\nActually, the free roam mode which unlocks after you complete the main story does have a currency system. And it correctly deducts your fines from your money.\n\n\nIf I recall correctly, you make money by killing other mafioso's. And I think it only acted as a high score system?\n\nIIRC the free roam had some of the best missions. For example in one you have to get in time to the lady that is tied up on the beach, If you don’t get there in time a sea monster gets her. Or where you have to chase and kill a guy that’s running in his underwear really fast. The mission were pretty tough but the cars you get as a reward were so worth it.\n\nEdit: As far as the missions go, there wasn’t a list of missions or a marker on the map of any sort. You had to free roam the city and look around for a guy that’s always dressed the same and he’s waving. He would blend with the crowd and would be a pain in the ass to spot. And this was before widespread internet. I couldn’t just google all the locations. Sometimes I would roam around for hours just trying to find him.\n\nDid they keep that in the remaster? I've just redownloaded it this weekend gone, hadn't gotten round to playing it\n\nOnly a few of the missions from the free ride extreme were kept and incorporated into the open world of the remastered game\n\n*remake\n\nThere is a free roam in definitive edition but I don’t know what the missions are. \nAlso, unrelated to free roam. When you chase Morelo, there are two endings. He will more often than not turn to the airport. But sometimes he doesn’t turn and continue to drive straight on the highway where they encounter a damaged bridge and manage to stop at the edge of it. You then proceed to ram him off. I beat the game at least 20-30 times as a kid and got the bridge ending just a couple of times.\n\nIf you click the door to the lighthouse it will show you their locations. You still have to figure out exactly where that is on the map, but usually there's some geographical feature in the background that gives you a hint.\n\nI still play this game every couple of years.\n\nHoly hell, I finished this game for the first time earlier this year and figured free roam was just exploring so I stopped. Guess I can download it again and get some more missions. \n\nIn retrospect, it makes a lot of sense with all the parts of the cities that were unused in the story, and the tons of stuff all around for a game from that era.\n\nYeah, but you could only pay two times. Third time, you are getting arrested no matter what and its game over.\n\nOnly in you get caught by the same policemen\n\nId roleplay as a bus driver doing my daily high school route to earn an honest living as a child.\n\nThe 1930s were crazy about child labour laws.\n\n A kid bus driver? At least drive the street car where you can't drive off a bridge or mountain\n\nDriver 3 was underrated\n\nRoad signs as waypoints were pretty cool\n\nThe only series that seems to do that eh? \n\nWant me to admire your open world? Don't make me follow the minimap. Little road signs to guide the way\n\nAlso the old timey radio narrating a baseball game? I was rooting for the Empire City Lancers every time\n\nIt was smart to follow the rules of the road in story missions because you had limited health and healing stations were rare. If you got into a fender bender at a stop and lost some health you might not be able to get it back. \n\nIt also had road signs to help you navigate in world without using a minimap. So immersive.\n\nAnd a working speed limiter to help you with those speed limits.\n\nI loved just driving around the city and taking the train around the city.\n\nIf you did a crime in public, you didn't get cops on you instantly unless there was a cop in your vicinity. Instead, people would run towards police phones and call them on you.\n\nPretty sure that feature didn't make it into the original game, it is apparently in Definitive Edition, though.\n\nYou could also shoot the wheels off of cars entirely by shooting their hubs enough!\n\nIt took me years to realize that. It made the pursuit mission from the gas station so much easier once I learned that.\n\nIf you shot his wheels out before going into the motel. He will have no car to run and it will be a straight shootout on the parking lot.\n\nYes, that's what I alluded to. Though, if you did it the hard way you could keep the car.\n\nedit: grammar\n\nI remember playing part of this game.  Early on there is a car chase. It was pretty difficult to shoot and drive at the same time.  It took a few tries.  On one attempt, before meeting the character you're going to chase, I shot out the tires on his car.   When he made a break for it, his tires were still shot out making the chase very easy.\n\nI think I know the mission, the motel with the yellow sports car. I used that strategy too in replays.\n\nIndividually flattened tyres that affected handling and wheels that could be shot or broken off as well. Not only did the gas meter work and fuel was consumed at a modelled rate but the gas tank could become holed and drain, leaving you without much fuel.\n\nThere's a mission where you sneak into a mansion on the top of a hill with winding roads all the way up. On the escape I took the car that people hid behind as cover. I shotgunned the crap out of them. \n\nYou're also on the mission with an Italian safe cracker that speaks no English. Dude was screaming Italian at me at a constant rate as I took the hill down instead of the road and I could tell it wasn't nice. I did the mission again and drove out without being caught and he was very nice to me.\n\nAhhh Salvatore\n\nI stole this from another redditor I'll tag them at the end, thanks Jackie 9mm, you're a saint \n\n&gt;Most of this is pretty underwhelming, and can be figured out contextually, but I figured some of you may want to know what's being said. Godere (enjoy)\n\nSal: Do you speak at least a little Italian? Did the boss tell you the plan?\n\nTom: Ah, I don't speak Italian.\n\nSal: Excellent (sarcastic).\n\nSal: Fantastic...Know...Plan?\n\nTom: Yeah, the boss told me the plan.\n\nSal: Err...please...understand..we enter the maze without them hearing or seeing us. The safe is behind a painting on the first floor. Give me some time and let me do everything. That safe will definitely have an alarm.\n\nTom: Uh. Yeah, this is going to be a long night for the both of us.\n\nSal: (sigh) Holy Christ.\n\nTom: Ok, my turn. Do what I do. Do not get caught.\n\nSal: Yes.\n\nTom: You gotta keep safe.\n\nSal: Safe! Yes! Is...my job! I open the safe! Open 'safe'!\n\nTom: Christ. Okay: radio. Let's listen to the radio.\n\nSal: Excellent.\n\n(The duo reach the top of the hill while driving)\n\nTom: Hell of a view up here.\n\nSal: Sometimes this country is gorgeous.\n\n(The duo reach the mansion)\n\nSal: Here. We enter from there. Errr... over...wall... ...maze.\n\nTom: What?\n\nSal: You'll see.\n\n(They jump the fence)\n\nTom: Ohh. A maze.\n\nSal: Yes. A labyrinth.\n\nTom: Stay here while I take out the guards.\n\nSal: Apparently, in America they have labyrinths...\n\n(After Tom takes out the guards, they exchange a couple of \"Where are you\"s and \"I'm here\"s. Then, before entering...)\n\nTom: Guy's a pain in the ass.\n\nSal: Come on! Come here with me!\n\nSal: (exhales after noticing the knocked out guards) You're a tough guy, huh?\n\nTom: What?\n\nSal: (gesturing toward door) There is an entrance. Open. Kick!\n\nTom: What kinda lockpicker are you?\n\n(Kick)\n\nSal: Look for... ...painting.\n\nTom: A what?\n\nSal: Err...Da Vinci. Caravaggio...(painters, obviously)\n\nTom: You're saying it's behind a painting?\n\nSal: Yes. Yes.\n\nTom: Ok, now I understand.\n\n(When looking at a the wrong painting)\n\nSal: Not that.\n\n(After finding the safe)\n\nSal: Ah! Good boy! (Or \"great work\", masculine)\n\nSal: Excuse me. (informal)\n\nTom: Sure. Show me what you can do.\n\n(The car pulls in)\n\nTom: Shit! Be quick, Salvatore!\n\nSal: Shhh! Patience, patience...\n\n(Sal opens the safe)\n\nTom: Nice work, excuse me (still informal; ironically more literal than when Sal said it)\n\n(The alarm sounds)\n\nSal: It was connected to the alarm!\n\nTom: What?\n\nSal: Trapped!\n\nTom: Doesn't matter! C'mon we gotta get outta here.\n\n(Tom motions to the doorway)\n\nTom: Go behind, behind!\n\n(After the shootout)\n\nSal: Car!\n\nTom: Car! Finally, I get ya first time.\n\nSal: Come on, let's go!\n\nSal: Quick! Outrun the cops!\n\nTom: I know! Whatever you're saying: I know!\n\n(After outrunning the cops)\n\nTom: Salvatore, where do I take you now?\n\nSal: ...home.\n\nTom: Yeah, where home?\n\nSal: Err...Sixth and...maple...\n\nTom: Ok, let's go.\n\nSal: Tommy, I have something to say to you. On our next job, I'll take care of the safe, do you understand? I almost lost my life in that villa, and it's all your fault. And learn at least a little Italian, out of respect for our country! (Sigh) It's like talking to my dog, I know, but Christ, I had to say it. Don't ever do that again. Never again.\n\nTom: Okay, okay. Sure. \n\nSal: Good night.\n\nTom: Night.\n\n/u/jack_9mm\n\nJust played the game over the weekend. It's so nice to know what was said now. Thanks\n\nYou could shoot the driver of a car through the window and he fell on the maneuver.  I don't think GTA 3 had this.\n\nWhat also blew my mind: you could leave your car somewhere, take the tram to travel across the city and the car would still be parked at the same spot.\n\nI remember a PC gamer article specifically mentioning the fact that you could shoot tires and they'd actually puncture and go flat.\n\n&gt; Extensive damage models to cars with individually breakable windows. \n\nOh there's way more to it than that. Cars actually deform when crashed, and not just in the early GTA, \"swap undamaged body panel for crumpled one\" way. Wheels can also be damaged in multiple ways - tires deflate when shot, and the whole wheel falls off when the hub is shot.\n\nMafia 1 was an insane achivement in cop AI. It still stands out because most games didnt bother with this level of detail for its cops, they just have the cops shooting to kill at star 1.\n\nCop AI for all Mafia games: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADWtA7W2cX4\n\nThe cops respond to different kinds of reckless driving, they hand out tickets, they had actual tactics including pit maneuvers. The only place they fell apart was on foot but they had serious range on their guns that GTA cops didnt have until years later.\n\nIts a shame that as the series progressed, the cop AI got sanded down because blending in with traffic was too slow.\n\nMan, you nailed it.  I remember being blown away by how real the city felt before, and don't even get me started on that soundtrack\n\nMafia 2 when you walk to your mom’s apartment after getting back from the war. There are so many small details in the walk that make it so immersive. Like people boarding up windows, mob guys extorting a shop owner. People shutting blinds. A woman throwing stuff out of a window from an argument. I loved Mafia but Mafia 2 was amazing. \n\nI felt like Mafia 3 was an entirely different game and it bummed me out.\n\nMost of the city music was Django Reinhardt\n\nOne of the greatest videogames ever made. What a masterpiece.\n\nI remember playing it on a Pentium4 with Hyper Threading, on an EVGA NVidia 6800, and feeling like hot shit because the frame rates were higher than my friend’s PC because it was the first time I had something better than him (which didn’t last long lmao). \n\nThen, ten years ago, I installed it on my Surface Pro 3 and played it at work on a slow day, and felt like hot shit all over again because I could relive my childhood.\n\nYup.  Too bad it was followed by mediocre sequels.\n\nLoved this game, despite the fact my graphics card was slowly dying at the time so it was all glitchy and weird. Still one of the [best intros](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tQZkKBRbzg) to a game too. I both love and hate the racing mission though.\n\n[removed]\n\nNot to nitpick but it's a remake right? Mafia 2 got the remaster.\n\nThere's no way a 22 year old game looks that good with just a remaster\n\n[removed]\n\nHands down THE BEST remake ever. I played Mafia 1 when it was originally released and I played the remake and holy shit did they do an insanely amazing job. \n\nSo many remakes/remasters nowadays are just cash grabs but this was so so so good it blew my mind. \n\nMajor props to the studio in charge of this remake, it’s still the best remake ever.\n\nIt's currently available on Gamepass and it's so so good!\n\nwas debating whether this was worth downloading or not the other day, and y’all just convinced me!\n\nI've picked it up on Gamepass as my first introduction to the series and honestly I couldn't place what decade the original was from, feels like a very polished and well-done modern game.\n\nAt the same time it closes a lot of the possible alternative approaches to some of the missions and is much less climatic for me.\n\nMan I miss those old graphics\n\n\"When they started racing here twenty years ago, most guys d-d-din't even make the f-f-finish\" - Ralph\n\nA lovely nod in the remaster to how the original was recieved.\n\nI hated this mission so much! I won by accident. If I recall correctly, one of the corner I managed to pile a few cars and then gotten myself ahead somehow.\n\nThis mission was my Souls game before anyone even thought about making Dark Souls. Bloody brutal.\n\nIt took me probably about 100 tries to win the race. For a kid who played GTA III and TOCA Race Driver, it was a bit too much, but I did it at the end without the cheating trick.\n\nThis mission sadly ended my remake replay. I wanted to casually replay the game and not ragequit after 20 failed attempts of this race\n\nAfter reading this and the other comments, I realized how easy I had it. I've never played the game before the remake and beat this first try. But most of my other gaming consists of racing simulators.\n\nI believe it was made easier in the remake. I played it and it was like a breeze. The original had an uncontrolable car when you just thought about pressing the gas in turns.\n\nI swear it was even harder than the original somehow\n\nWhat!? I found it much it easier, I did it on the first try\n\nThere is a shortcut in this race.\nI always took the shortcut.\n\nIt was blocked in the remake.\n\nThis game was way ahead of its time and it really felt like playing a movie from the perspective of a 22 years ago hardcore gamer. I loved every detail of the world and the atmosphere and i still think it has an unmatched cinematic attention to detail when compared to most mainstream games of today.\n\nJust looking at how cigarettes generated circular smoke patterns when characters were talking in cutscenes left me speechless back then.\n\nI played Mafia for the first time some weeks ago. I loved how well the story was written, and how great the characters are. You started to build a relation with them, after a while they felt like family.\n\nIt has such a strong, immersive atmosphere, making the game one of the best of all time.\n\nI also liked how genuinely challenging it was while usually not being unfair.\n\nSome parts/ missions were a genuine struggle though. The race, the bootleg alcohol deal in the parking house, the sneak mission into the attorneys manor, the final mission and some of the longer driving sequences could be a bit tedious.\n\nBut the game still holds up very well. Mafia 2 and it's expansions are also awesome and challenging.\n\nBoth games missed out on the opportunity of filling the world with activities. I would've loved some GTA-style side missions like taxi driving to go for between missions. They missed an opportunity there but awesome games nonetheless.\n\nThe first game has two free roam modes with quite a few activities including driving people in a taxi, that are very fun and replayable\n\n&gt; Just looking at how cigarettes generated circular smoke patterns when characters were talking in cutscenes left me speechless back then.\n\nand lip sync!!! this was the first (major?) game to have actual face mimics match what people were saying and because of that the whole cutscenes looked like a movie, at the time it was groundbreaking\n\nI remember there's a way to \"cheat\" in order to win the race\n\nIf i remember correctly, at start go reverse to one of the narrow corner and wait there, start a collision pile-up with the rest of the cars, somehow they'll get stuck there unable to untangle themselves from the pile-up\n\ncontinue your race normally, easy #1\n\nThere was the switch car button, don't remember exactly how it worked but it was basically a cheat.\n\nThere's also a place where you can cut a corner, for a significantly shorter drive, while still counting as a full round. It's been 20 years so I forget where, but some walkthroughs probably still exist somewhere.\n\nGameFAQs: *This is my time to shine*\n\nGoing to the text-based FAQs on that website from decades ago feels like opening an old scroll in a dusty tomb to confirm the \"knowledge of the ancients\".\n\nIt's so much quicker than skipping around a hour long Youtube video of a random streamer that made a video about it.\n\nSo true, especially when you find ones where they built in search codes to jump to specific sections of the document.  It was impressive what they were able to accomplish with basic text documents.\n\nYep, you had to use the shortcut and cheese realism with the \"reset car\" button which would then teleport you to the finish line ahead of the rest of the cars.\n\nYou could also, on the straight past the lake after the first hairpin, hang a left between some barriers rather than going right and up the hill, and there was another bit of track. The game would declare \"wrong way\" and your position would fall. Resetting your car would put you back to the entrance to the closed road, with one excpetion. If you got to the barriers at the other end but did *not* continue back onto the actual track and hit the \"reset vehicle\" button it would teleport you to just before the finish line on your current lap - i.e. ahead of the rest of the cars.\n\nYou could basically skip the whole race if you did that for every lap.\n\nAh, the old F1 game strategy for winning in Monaco\n\nStarted that up last weekend cuz its on game pass\n\nNever played it before, saw it on game pass, loaded it up...\n\nWell damn if it wasn't one of the best games I've played in years. It absolutely holds its own against today's \"AAAA\" titles.\n\nWtf happened to linear, character driven, single player campaigns? Everything open-world is just too overwhelming, and requires the most bland kind of quests in order to spread out and use the whole space. This was a perfectly large map while still being concise, and also the cut scenes felt worth the investment of time. \n\nI'm honestly blown away by the quality, and very happy to have been given the opportunity to experience via the remaster because I probably wouldn't have been able to get through 2002 graphics. \n\n11/10 highly recommend\n\nFelt like I was playing a movie. I absolutely hated Paulie (Jeremy Luke) at the start of the game, but felt like he was a close friend by the end. \n\n^^Love ^^ya ^^Paulie\n\n[removed]\n\nIts up there along with Red Dead Redemption 2 as one of the best story and acting of all time.\n\nThe mission with Frank at the airport broke my heart just as much as the mission where Arthur gives John Marston his hat\n\nFuck me I'm crying just thinking about my horse. You were a good girl\n\nWho struggled with this race mission?)\n\nThere's even a reference to it in the remake. After the win, one of the npc characters remarks that even twenty years ago some drivers never finished the race.\n\nYeah there were a few changes in the script that were really neat touches.\n\nIt's hard even in the remake lol\n\nTook me about 6 tries\n\n(The remake is extremely good btw, you should play it)\n\nOn the \"realistic\" driving setting I couldn't do it. Had to use the easy driving mode to complete the mission.\n\n6 tries? I quit just because I couldn't finish it, fuck it was so hard\n\nI switched to easy mode just for this race\n\nAll the time. I don't remember how many times I had to replay that mission, but I know it was quite a few times.\n\nI think I got it on my second go. But then I played a lot of racing games back in the day.\n\nI actually finished 1st my first time. Don't know if it was a fluke or what but I'll take it.\n\nNah, was super easy for me since I have always been into sim racing. I also recognised that others will have a problem with it. they did build a historic racing sim for an action game.\n\nThis was my favourite game in my childhood! It was made by Czech developers and studio and it was one of the very few titles that had Czech dubbing which I could understand before I could speak English. And the dubbing and the one liners were hilarious, much better than the English version as I've found out much later. I also appreciate that they brough back most of the original cast for the remaster. Legendary game, truly ahead of it's time. Mafia II as well.\n\nOne of the greatest games ever made still today, the realism of the missions are what most game developers could take a lesson from today.\n\n22 years? Vile lies.\nThat was only 15 years ago\n\nBullshit. it was like 10 years ago.\n\npffft. that's practically last year.\n\nNah it was yesterday\n\nIs it really 22 years already! Damn! Feels like yesterday getting from school playing it.\n\nMan this is the only game I ran out of gas on a mission wtf\n\nI work in games and I remember this coming out and I played through it at work \"for research\" while we were between projects. It blew us away and I utterly loved it. \n\nIt was a wonderful experience at the time. I notivced a re-maters has just gone up on Game Pass so I will probably give it another go\n\nI just finished Mafia Definitive Edition.\n\nIt's a masterpiece.\n\nThe best looking DirectX 8.1 game by a HUGE margin. Nothing else was even close. It requires much lesser hardware while looking just as good if not better than GTA SA.\n\nIMHO this is THE GAME. Nothing ever came close to the narrative, cinematic masterpiece that Mafia is. From start to finish this game just pulls you into it's gangster world. Along with Thief and NOLF, Mafia is my personal favorite game ever.\n\nMr. Salieri sends you his regards.\n\n[removed]\n\nOne of my proudest gamer moments was beating that race on classic mode in the remaster.  I posted the video to youtube.  It took days of practice.  Not my cleanest race lines but the AI cheats so bad I had to play dirty.\n\nLosing bullets left in clip when changing should be in more games..\n\nMy favorite racing sim😁\n\nI played it on ps2 originally. It's one of my all time favorites. Crazy it's been 22 years since release.\n\nApparently the PS2 release actually got the racing level as a replayable feature?\n\nWhat a banger story and i really liked the realism with cars and guns and you die like couple of shots.\n\nI wish the same team that remade the first game would remake the the other two.\n\nI'm playing the definitive edition right now. Beautiful game.\n\nThis stupid race on the screenshot is still giving me nightmares to this day"

I have some horror games that are still guaranteed to give me a fright. XD\n\nBased on the leaks we have I'm gonna assume we'll have the new valve VR headset before steam deck 2.0 . This is just my opinion though but it does seem likely.\n\nIt'd be funny if we get something like that cardboard switch accessory that simulates vr by having you hold it to your face\n\nCould be interesting. The steam deck can apparently run VR wirelessly I guess but not sure how well it would do that. \n\nI've run my quest 2 wireless to my PC and it's a pretty good experience playing HL Alyx. \n\nI'd rather just have a modular system though if i were to settle on Valve for everything. \n\n* Handheld / Gaming system docked\n* streaming add on headset with enough processing power to handle the necessary features to use it + connect to steam deck.  \n* Upgrade either one and have them all backwards compatible. The VR headset could even have magnetically attached lenses for pop-in upgrades. \n\nNot likely to happen though, technology in the VR space has been advancing quite a bit and I think it'd be hard to future proof that. I'd be interested in a new headset though once the optics are more mature.\n\nThe lens upgrade of the Q3 is impressive, highly recommend giving it a try.\n\nYou know the bastards are gonna name it Steam Half Deck.  The only thing they love more than tech is trolling other people who love tech.\n\n&gt; The only thing they love more than tech is trolling other people who love tech.\n\nThey sat on their ass for a decade then out of nowhere build the greatest Nintendo piracy device, which also competes with the switch while also screwing over Microsoft by creating Proton and making Linux gaming a thing.\n\nJust a casual Valve W.\n\nNot to mention before they launched there wasn't a handheld market, it was the Switch and cellphones.  Sony tapped out long ago and everyone else has been too afraid to go against the big N in market share.  They're truly mad lads in the field of taking innovation and refining it, and generally do it in a way that's consumer friendly.\n\nThere was a very niche but growing market of handheld windows PCs for gaming. The Steam Deck just undercut them on price and over delivered on support and hype.\n\nThe price difference is insane, so many steam deck competitors are screwed. Mainly because Windows 11 performance on mobile is terrible.\n\n&gt; Not to mention before they launched there wasn't a handheld market, it was the Switch and cellphones. \n\nJust because you weren't aware doesn't mean there wasn't a market... GPD was around for years optimizing windows handhelds for a long time.

They can practically just do whatever the fuck they want without the need to screw over the consumer.  \n\nIt really is a blessing that Gaben isn't like every other money hungry CEO out there who can only think about hoarding as much as possible.\n\nAlso the fact that Valve isn't publicly traded so they don't have to simp over shareholder wallets\n\nThe private ownership is probably a huge part of the steam direction and success with R&amp;D.\n\nPlus the fact that they over time build a gaming focused social network that will probably take priority over any other service because you're already buying games on it.\n\nPrivate ownership is part of it, but i think its mainly just Gaben being great.\n\nSteam started as a DRM platform for Valve to sell games like Counterstrike.\n\nPeople hated it at first, but seeing that DRM was going to be a big thing going forward Gaben decided to instead make a DRM that offers values to the players.\n\nThen, when they had virtually no competition, they could have sat on their laurels.\n\nBut no, they kept developing steam and making it more attractive for Devs and players.\n\nYes like Apple they take their 30% of steam sales, but they also provide a store front, Multiplayer systems and Anticheat and even really recently added things like online split screen coop, which if your game has Split screen, its one button for the developer in Steam to enable Multiplayer through streaming for your game.\n\nTHey didn't have to add all those things, they did because Gaben seems to actually care about making a good product that *deserves* peoples money even though they effectively had a monopoly.\n\nThats rare in any massive company let alone an effective monolpoly.\n\n\nSteam and Valve do have their problems, but goddamn the fact they are as good as they are is very impressive.\n\n&gt;Plus the fact that they over time build a gaming focused social network that will probably take priority over any other service because you're already buying games on it.\n\nAbsolutely, things like Steam deck are just as much about driving people to use Steam as actually selling units. They dont have to care as much about releasing new decks constantly as long as people are using the ones they already have.\n\n[deleted]\n\nIdk, it works fine, it's only minor quality of life stuff that would change like exterior tracking and no cord. VR is kind of stuck in terms of good games, so idk what the point of Valve trying to push that again would be. Facebook hogs all the exclusives, so anyone getting an index gets a little burned\n\nNo cord is such a huge game changer in vr imo.  Going from a desktop headset to the quest and not having to be conscious of where my cord was at all times felt like such a huge upgrade even if its kinda minor in the grand scheme of things.\n\nIv really got to do my research on VR. When it first launched I said Id wait till the cords and multiple sensors are no longer needed. Then headsets without them came out but I always heard they were basically like gaming on your phone instead of a PC so I again kept waiting.\n\nFeel like I may be working with outdated info now.\n\n&gt; I always heard they were basically like gaming on your phone instead of a PC\n\nI mean, that is fundamentally what standalone mobile VR systems like the Quest are. Strip away the exterior, and you have a core built on smartphone architecture, right down to running a custom fork of Android.\n\nWhich also means there are performance caveats, as you're running very high resolution displays with a very high refrech rate on said smartphone architecture.\n\nIMO something like the Quest really only shines when you can offload the frame rendering onto a far more capable device via a system like Quest Link.\n\n&gt;IMO something like the Quest really only shines when you can offload the frame rendering onto a far more capable device via a system like Quest Link.\n\nYeah; or through Virtual Desktop, which will also let you emulate Index controllers &amp; vive trackers if you choose to, so you can get decent hand tracking (with a quest 3) and half-body tracking.\n\nThough I use the link cable if I'm doing war thunder VR.\n\nTheirs certainly still some experiences that are pc exclusive, but i think you'd be surprised how many great games run natively on the quests.\n\nEven still you can airlink a quest to your pc(going to need the latest wifi standards for best result) and play pc exclusives as well(assuming your pc is capable of playing them anyway).\n\nOh wow for real? I may have to do some research then and pick up a quest.\n\nThe best way to do it from my research is to get one of the cheap ~$40 routers that has 5GHz to use exclusively for the Quest. \n\nYou can find the latest recommended ones on their subreddit.\n\nI use a quest 3, it has decent stand alone games, and I'm finally playing Alyx via steam VR as I recently upgraded my gaming desktop.\n\nSuper happy with the setup.\n\nairlink. The only thing I run natively on my quest is the button to turn on airlink. \n\nEdit: Actually, I use the steam link button. It's pretty much flawless.\n\nThat's funny - I just got a cord for my new Quest 3 and prefer it so much more.\n\nThe grays of the index are fucking awful. Like immersion breaking-Ly bad. I’m honestly baffled they launched a game with moody dark scenes like Half Life Alyx without OLED\n\nYeah I think the technology is still waiting for an advancement that makes it a mainstream choice and not a niche hobby. I think Valve should wait until they can bring a big innovation before a new one.\n\n&gt; Idk, it works fine, it's only minor quality of life stuff that would change like exterior tracking and no cord.\n\nNah, an Index 2 would no doubt have substantially more than that. It would have eye tracking, possibly face tracking, maybe body tracking, much higher resolution displays, pancake lenses, and color mixed reality.\n\nBro fr. Mine is like 3-4 years old now. Very used. And I’m still just waiting for a headset to come out that can replace it.  There’s so many options that are better in one or two ways, but completely missing the mark on the rest. There’s nothing as all around complete as the index and the index is really starting to age in the VR market.\n\nIt’s lens are like actually bad, some of the worst if not the worst you can even get now on the market. There’s no auto IPD or eye tracking. No wireless option. Poorly built cord that needs to be replaced several times almost at least once yearly that adds on to its operating cost. I’m at the point of ordering my 3rd replacement cord for it, I’m almost the entire cost of buying the headset independently from valve in just replacing the cord.\n\nI switched to using a quest pro for gaming from my PC, and it's so damn nice not to have to deal with wires or being in a room with lighthouses. I can game in PCVR from any room in my house now and don't have to worry about tangling or damaging the wire. The quest 3 has better lenses and a better display than the Index, it really is an amazing deal for the price.\n\nI am worried valve will only be decent as long as gaben is alive and well.\n\nI'd expect a small dropoff but Gaben is passionate enough about the corporate structure of Valve that I'm sure he's expressed to his son that he wants to keep it that way. \n\nAs long as they don't go public it should be fine.\n\nNot going public is the biggest one I believe.\n\nWell given that I've heard his son quite likes final Fantasy 14 I'm going to go ahead and assume he has a heart of gold LOL\n\nImagine if Steam was a publicly traded company \n\nQuarterly decks that alternate between giving you 15% more battery life or screen sharpness.\n\nEach new Deck goes back to an LCD screen with an upgrade option several months later to OLED.\n\nHD becomes a subscription service that you have to pay monthly for.\n\nOh God don't give them ideas!\n\nNah the Steamdeck would never happened in the first place. A public traded company investing heavy in Proton to get Windows games running on a Linux Handheld? I highly doubt that.\n\nA public company investing in a technology to remove a dependency on their largest competitor? Happens all the time. \n\nThey didn’t even invest that much into it. 100 developers (which is apparently what they’ve grown to for all open source support, not just proton) is pretty small for most US listed companies, ~$25 million per year. A major project but in the context of creating a standalone gaming platform without Microsoft licensing fees, it’s fairly modest. \n\nThe steam deck is pretty much exactly what you’d expect a publicly traded company seeking growth would do - start trying to capture the rest of the value chain in gaming, build their brand and own the entire experience.\n\n“They didn’t even invest that much into it.”\n\nYou aren’t factoring in the massive logistical and financial overhead involved in creating a piece of hardware for mass production. You need to spend a significant amount of capital to prototype, test, and engineer a piece of hardware for mass production — and then you have the production costs of making the actual units for consumers, and then you need to pay for shipping and delivery of that inventory to the end user.\n\nValve is in a unique position where they don’t have to spend money on advertising, which is where other companies would bleed money on a project like this. But the idea that they only had to “invest” in paying developers to make the Steam Deck happen is just flat-out wrong.\n\nI was responding to the comment of “A public traded company investing heavy in Proton”.\n\nThe hardware investment had nothing to do with this.\n\nA publicly traded company would have done it the cheap and fast way with all the compromises and issues that entails. It's not theoretical either, look at Google Stadia, an example of a public company trying to use Linux to create a vertically integrated video game focused software/hardware stack. They even eventually rolled their own ground-up alternative to Wine.\n\nGoogle totally could have done it the \"proper\" FOSS way. Frankly, they should have. But they didn't, because then they wouldn't have a proprietary software stack all to themselves (not it ended up being useful or worth the money to do that, but shareholders like all those words).\n\nI think you mean thinner and lighter, with no headphones jack, now with 50% ^^^less battery capacity and 15 cameras!!!\n\nAvailable now in grey, dark blueish grey, sorta maroonish grey, silver, black, almost black but kinda green, and different black!\n\nI’ve never been a big fan of screens slicing up my soft flesh so I guess I’m on team battery life.\n\nI feel like Valve are as successful as they are because they're *not* a publicly traded company. No shareholders to constantly prove their worth to.\n\nIt basically just lets them plan out long term success as opposed to trying to make numbers go up every quarter.\n\nI think it helps a lot with Steam. No other digital storefront seems to be able to make major in-roads. \n\nIf Valve were publicly traded, there would likely be pressure to pursue growth, which would probably end a lot of the advantages of Steam.\n\ngoodbye user reviews\n\nNo you would still have reviews, they just would hide the negative ones like youtube.\n\nValve would allow game companies the ability to pay a subscription fee and they can remove and moderate their own reviews on Steam because $$$$\n\nShareholders are absolutely mental and are the ones to blame for every problem in the world. They have this expectation that the number MUST be green every single fucking day. If that number isn't green, then everyone must kill themselves to try and make it green.\n\nIt's really not rocket science to make a profitable company. Offer a superior product at a competitive price with solid customer service. The rest takes care of itself.\n\nIf I posted my feelings about the shareholder problem I would be banned 🙂\n\nSame dude, I think I'd get the FBI at my door lmao \n\nThese people are ruining our civilization and depriving us of our true potential. Parasites\n\n\"Every problem in the world\" is a bit of an overstatement, but yeah, it's definitely a shit system that incentivizes a lot of extremely harmful behavior\n\nHuh, an economic model that prioritises long-term planning over short-term returns for a small owner class detached from the workers, where have I heard that before?\n\nBig factor here is that Steam can play long game. They don't need to hit profit margins every three months. They could even do loss for 5 years if they believe it's better for the future.\n\nPublic stock is just way too short sighted. They only care what happens for next year or maybe two. After that if things go south, executives will just abandon the ship and try again in another company. That's why public companies are so shit.\n\nPrivate companies have shareholders too\n\nThats exactly it yea, shareholders are parasites obsessed with number up. Aggressive number up and long term consistent quality product aren't really compatible.\n\nMaybe it’s time to quit supporting publicly traded companies entirely\n\nreddit is publicly traded\n\n[removed]\n\nI would, but where would I go? All my forums are dead.\n\nDiscord! oh.... right people are posting important stuff on there that should actually be on forums :headslap:\n\nReddit became even more of a shithole since though...\n\nYeah I usually can understand how companies need to find ways to make money, but Reddit is entirely supported by people voluntarily putting stuff on the website.\n\n\"Not the ones I like, lets boycott only the companies I already don't consume\"\n\nI agree that Valve being privately owned has helped make them better. Protect them from really bad decisions.\n\nAlthough, Xbox, Playstation, and Nintendo all came to the same conclusion that you only release a new console when there is a generational leap. Valve released the Steam Deck 2 years ago, and last year released the OLED version. Those other consoles usually wait a bit longer than that for their mid-generation refreshes and ~6 years between generations.\n\nValve is resisting the smartphone release schedule. Which I don't think gaming consoles could sustain anyways. The console advantage over normal PCs is that you buy one and it is not obsolete 1 year later.\n\nGabe is such a libertarian he would never let shareholders tell his employees what to do\n\nHe's the smart kind of libertarian that treats his employees like adults and listens to advice from his peers, and he doesn't take himself too seriously.\n\nThat'd just called being an adult and good person.\n\nBoard members will.\n\nSteam is not a company.  Steam is a product.  Valve is the company.\n\nYes, we all know that Valve releases Steam.\n\nYes we all know that valves release steam.\n\nOr Gabe just wanted to do that. \n\nThere are plenty of privately held shitty companies.\n\nYeah but the public companies are shitty by design.\n\nShitty by law.\n\nNot shitty by law.\n\nShitty by people.\n\nThe company has to work in the best interest of the shareholders. That is not the same thing as maximizing profits. The problem is that maximizing profits for the company is also maximizing the profits of the people that run the company.\n\nPeople act like shareholders are some death squad with guns to the heads of CEOs. Nobody is forcing shitty decisions. They are chosen. I highly doubt there's any CEOs out there just desperately wanting to be a great company for employees and customers but just isn't \"allowed\" to.\n\n&gt; I highly doubt there's any CEOs out there just desperately wanting to be a great company for employees and customers but just isn't \"allowed\" to.\n\nThat's exactly what happened in the defining case law. \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodge_v._Ford_Motor_Co.\n\nno, shitty by law - SCOTUS precedent\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodge_v._Ford_Motor_Co.\n\nThis is a profit driven decision based on the lack or real competition.\n\nWait for Gabe to pass away, it will probably happen.\n\nIt won't go public when Gaben dies.  Ownership would transfer to Gaben's estate who will execute his will on his behalf.  It would be extremely unusual if there wasn't a plan in place already,\n\nWhat is likely is that ownership will be transferred to and shared by Gabe's wife and two sons. It also goes without saying that Gabe's family is not hurting for money so they would not have any compelling reason whatsoever to sell Valve or go public.\n\nIf there is any company on earth I actually trust wholeheartedly it's Valve.   Things will be fine.\n\nYou may be correct, but don't under estimate how greedy affects people. His whole family could turn on each other and destroy the company. Look at Bob Ross, the most wholesome person ever, got fucked over and had his estate stolen from his family and to this day, his family doesn't see a dime from anything with the name Bob Ross on it.\n\nThere’s a few companies that managed to stay family run and stand by their original principles as much as reasonably expected. Hermes is a good example of something we can hope ends up happening with valve.\n\nThe thing is being public doesn’t always mean more profits though, it’s just easier access to capital, which valve really doesn’t need\n\nit would be so much worse\n\nAds all over the store and sales pages.  Cloud save subscriptions, with multiple tiered options.\n\nValve/Steam is like the last human company on this planet and we must protect them\n\nThe cynic in me is leading me to believe that this statement is partly meant to give that tiny little nudge to those indecisive buyers contemplating on getting one during the holidays.\n\nAnd I don't blame them, cause this definitely would work on me if money wasn't tight!\n\nPartly it is.  \nThe other part is that it is acompletely custom designed brd and hardware and believe it or not: designing that shit costs money. Hardware Valve doesn't really design and produce themselves.  \nI suspect the other part is simply yearly revisions not being worth it at all. They don't push the  numbers to justify that.\n\nI've lost all interest in Steamdeck competitors because they just seem to make too many versions. With a Steamdeck most of your issues will already be documented online when you encounter them. Those devices with yearly releases will be lacking in community and manufacturer support long term.\n\nAlso the whole software verification would become meaningless fairly quickly. As is steam deck verification is hugely important apparently (all the games you can use a controller for seem to be investing in it)\n\nThere was a large sale, just after public comments from someone about there being no major changes on the horizon. Two weeks later they released the OLED version\n\nThat would be me, lol  \nI'm thinking of pulling the trigger on the OLED version or waiting for a 2025 model (if one comes). If there is no 2025 model in the works, it makes the decision easier.\n\nI mean, even if they kept releasing more upgraded steam decks.....\n\n\nThe old ones would still work just fine. They just wouldn't play as intense games, or as high a resolution.\n\n\nLike instead of a new console, and locking out a generation of games behind a \"Not backwards compatible\" wall, you'd still be able to use an old steamdecj just fine.\n\n\nThat alone has already made it worth considerably more to me than my switch\n\nValve has also done some pretty incredible software optimization on their titles and steam as a whole.\n\n\n\nThey probably will keep this up with the decks.\n\nYeah, I mean the fact that some games run almost as fast as on comparable Windows handhelds (or faster) while all having to be driven through translation layers to run on a Linux-based machine is very impressive.\n\nIt's not a translation layer, it uses native libraries that were clean room developed to be compatible with the equivalent Windows libraries.  \n\nThe underlying tech is an OSS project called WINE, which stands for WINE Is Not an Emulator (Linux/Unix developers love recursive acronyms)  to underscore the fact it was intended to give Windows apps native compatibility with Linux, rather than requiring an emulation layer.  \n\nValve has done a lot of work with the developers to optimize a special version of it for Steam, though.\n\nTIL what WINE meant lol\n\nSeveral run better, not even just at parity.\n\nBut keeping the base hardware relatively uniform makes it easy for them to tell you whether a game supports steam deck or not.\n\nThey aren’t wrong but it also makes the answer “no” for a lot of games for 3 more years. I love my deck for the games that work its just too little of my library.\n\nThe steam deck existing alone works as an incentive for devs to make sure their games work on linux and that they work on a moderate spec system.\n\nReleasing a new one would weaken the latter.\n\nSo I think not upgrading the deck until it makes real progress is good. They can't just stick a 4090 in it because it'd have no battery life at all\n\nI think perhaps you’re too young to remember the early days of video game consoles. Back in the days of Atari and Commodore 64, the hardware would remain static for a DECADE or more — but the SOFTWARE kept getting better and better. \n\nDevelopers learned to hack the hardware, making it do things nobody could have imagined when the silicon was new. They did this because the hardware wasn’t changing, so in order to advance the art, they had to advance the software. Also, since the hardware WAS static, they had the time to learn what it could really do if you pushed hard enough.\n\nHeck, the arcade game “Sinistar” was programmed and ran on a 6802 chip, which is the same chip the C64 used. In order to make it do the amazing things it did they had to create its own MULTI-TASKING operating system! This was 1983, long before the days of Amiga (one of the first true multi-tasking operating systems) or Windows NT.\n\nIn modern times the hardware changes so rapidly that developers don’t have the TIME to learn how to push it to its limits.\n\nWhich games consoles release new models every year?\n\nI think they're more so comparing to iPhones\n\nGot it, so making a comparison literally no one makes to make a point everyone already understands.\n\nWhich sell more units in one week than Steam Decks have sold since launch. Maybe the markets are totally different?\n\nOr maybe they’re just saying you shouldn’t be upgrading every year when the “upgrade” is single percentages in performance\n\nJust because they sell millions of phones a year, doesn't mean it's the same people buying them each year\n\nThe are a few lesser known handheld PC consoles like Ayneo, AYN, GPD Win that had a yearly release, sometimes more than one a year.\n\nWell, yeah, if you look at it as a console it makes sense. The expectation of yearly model updates comes from the mobile device and PC industries, where laptops and phones get refreshed on an annual cadence.\n\nBut it's not a console. It's a handheld PC.\n\nIt’s sold as essentially a handheld gaming machine that plays pc games. Yes it can be a handheld pc but that’s not what it’s advertised as really let’s be honest\n\nThe closest that valve themselves uses is “console -like”. They in fact focus on pc gaming. \n\nEDIT:  Somehow my post got messed up by auto-correct.  I was trying to say that Valve's website used to say that it was a PC.\n\nAll a videogame console is is a specialised computer designed for playing videogames.\n\nThats all the steamdeck is. It's a handheld console.\n\nHow many times are we gonna see this article?\n\nUntil the farm has raised enough crop for the harvest... and the harvest after that, and after that, and after that, and after that, and after that...\n\nYes\n\nIt’s not fair to charge your customers the same price for old hardware 2 years in a row.\n\nDoes that mean that Steamdeck and Playstations should get cheaper every year?\n\nTheorically Valve shouldn't be seen as the best of the gaming giants, they introduced or at least influence a lot of what gamers hate nowadays, such as games being only digital (and henceforth not actually owning the games you buy), lootboxes, and a monopoly on the PC market.\n\nIt just so happens that their competitors are more greedy, and incompetent. Valve isn't doing anything particularly special, they just treat their customers fairly, which apparently is way too difficult for the rest of the gaming giants in the industry.\n\nI dread the day that Gaben is no longer in charge of Valve.\n\nI feel like Gabe has the attitude of \"i already have more money than I know what to do with, why would I make things shittier just to make even more to throw on the pile?\" \n\nOnly possible because it's a private company run by someone who seems like they're not insane.\n\nMore like, \"if I'm banking 500 million a year plus inflation steadily, why would I take risks when I can just keep banking that half billion\". A publicly traded company in the tech sector, that isnt good enough, if you dont return 10% or more to investors over inflation and making 525 billion next year you're seen as a failure, so you start doing stupid stuff that can hurt you long term like cut product quality or start taking risks.\n\nFire staff to cut costs, etc, etc.\n\nValve being somewhat famously a company that doesn't really fire, and lets employees self organise into what they want to work on, so doesn't really have people quit either.\n\nI wonder how things would be if more companies followed this mindset instead of enshittify and pump and dump. Would probably be quite nice.\n\nthe 60's and 70's were, by all accounts, quite nice, yes.\n\nYou’d probably get more to the bad side of this where tenure trumps talent and the company ultimately ends up risk averse and avoids any changes until after they become necessary.\n\nValve could have easily ended up the same way if only all their competitors hadn’t sabotaged themselves with premature eatshitification. Microsoft and Apple wanting too big of a cut in their own stores. Ubisoft and EA generally not really user desire for single libraries. Epic not understanding their consumers enough to make a compelling case to migrate to the Epic Games store outside of game giveaways.\n\nHonestly, Microsoft screwed it up the worst by never fully committing to making XBOX and PC a truly unified platform. All their vision for such a thing since the Windows 8 days, they really should have had something like the Steam Deck for PC &amp; Xbox gaming.\n\nI find the 'you don't own digitally purchased games' view to be a bit weird. If you have a physical disc, yeah you have it and no one can take it away from you - great. It can also break, get scratched, etc, and has drawbacks. If online servers get taken down, you lose that functionality just as you do with digital games for example. \n\nOn the digital side, has Steam been renowned for taking back access to games purchased by customers? Not at all as far as I'm aware. It's been around since 2004. I've never had an issue and I've been using the service since 2005. Prey 2006 you can't buy anymore, but this was the decision of Bethesda and not Valve/Steam, and if you already own it, then you still have access to it.\n\nWhat you're saying on this point is not anything that different from what most people say on digital games of course, but just thought I'd poke my head up on it. Digital games have also brought considerable benefits of course, but there seems to just be a hyper focus all the time on the negatives because people are unhappy about consoles ditching disc drives, etc.\n\nThey've delisted games but that's the publishers fault or other licensing issues and not Valve.\n\nEven if it's delisted, don't you usually get to keep it if you already own it? I'm pretty sure I have a couple delisted games and I can still play them just fine, you just can't buy them anymore.\n\nCorrect, you can still download and play. I bought a Project Cars 2 key after the game was delisted and still played it.\n\nI'm pretty sure I still have Resident Evil Operation City (Yeah, I know) even though it's been delisted for GFWL issues.\n\nI also have the Payday 2 Scarface DLC, which is pretty rare now I think since it got delisted years ago.\n\n&gt; Theorically Valve shouldn't be seen as the best of the gaming giants, they introduced or at least influence a lot of what gamers hate nowadays, such as games being only digital (and henceforth not actually owning the games you buy), lootboxes, and a monopoly on the PC market.\n\nDon't forget the battle pass, first seen in Dota 2!\n\nThe reality about a monopoly on the market is that not that Valve set out to create a monopoly necessarily but that there just aren't any serious competitors. Epic is still missing stuff like the Steam Workshop  and a bunch of other little features Steam has that they don't. GOG is a fairly solid platform, but also has the perception of being for a more niche demographic compared to Steam. Company specific launchers are almost universally seen as an annoyance at best in the wider gaming sphere. Say what you might about companies using Steam as a marketplace and it creating a vicious cycle, and you'd be right, but Steam can occupy so many wierd niches at once that others can't. It can be Nexus Mods, it can be Discord, it can be a forum, it can be a meme channel etc. It may not necessarily be better at any one thing than any individual site (though it is a better modding site than the Nexus) but it can be a lot of things at once.\n\nMeh. Digital-only is more preferred for a reason. It is way more convenient. We don't \"own\" games but if they ever, for whatever reason, took our games away we would just pirate. The only real loss is reselling used games and just the nostalgia of it all.\n\nThey have a monopoly on the PC market because they were well ahead of any competition. Nobody was even thinking of a digital game storefront when Steam first came to be. It wouldn't get competition until like a decade later when everybody has a huge library on steam.\n\nThey did kind of popularize lootboxes. Not a fan of it but I still don't get why people can't control themselves.\n\nYeah the steam deck OLED has like literally 20 legit improved or added features that they didn’t even bother marketing, you have to go searching for the all the specs. They undersold the thing massively I bet the third iteration will be significantly improved\n\nStill waiting on hot swappable batteries and a separate battery charger.  There now you have unlimited battery life and a chance to make a little bit more off of people who want 3 or more batteries\n\nI like the underlying sentiment, but do wonder how this works in real life. Games and hardware are often in an arms race when it comes to new AAA games. Where there's known mass market processing headroom, the developers use it instead of focusing on optimization in order to hit release schedules. So the generational leap in CPU/GPU could also be met with a generational leap in game requirements, thus a net zero performance/efficiency gain on new games. \n\nThat said, back catalogue would benefit from performance and battery life boost, so I suppose it's still a good thing. And I do like not having the equivalent of an \"Iphone S\" release. Give us a whole hearted sequel, not a minor performance bump.\n\ni mean lets be real steamdeck sales have slowed right down and deck 2 releasing anytime soon wouldnt do anything for sales\n\nI get the point, but it's weird people keep pretending like this is big or special when practically no console is doing big yearly iterations and it's pretty much just phones that are\n\nI'd take a generational leap in battery life with the same compute, too\n\nDid they not release the LCD version and then a year later do the OLED version lol\n\nAlmost 2 years, and in the context of the actual quote they are talking about waiting to release new devices with substantial performance improvements.\n\nThe OLED has a better screen, bigger battery (because the screen is thinner), and more power efficient (because of 6nm SOC). It performs ever so slightly better than the LCD, but it is a difference of maybe 2-3 fps at max in the same game.\n\nIt's essentially a refresh, not a new device. Anything that runs on the OLED can run on the LCD.\n\nOLED is just nice to look at as well. It hits that sweet spot of appeasing both casual and hardcore consumers. Everyone goes bananas for OLED with that contrast ratio. I still remember the first time I tried eating it because I found out it was organic.\n\nIt honestly felt like a serious upgrade to me. Even the case was a massive upgrade (that soft shell hidden in the hardshell blew my mind). \n\n\nIt lasts longer, and is far more beautiful. It was fully worth it for me, and I am usually more than happy to stick with the oldest version of consoles. The portability and durability really make it stand far above the other consoles for me. \n\n\nI've practically thrown the damn thing accidentally, dropped it on river rocks, had the dog sneak up and sleep on it, gotten it covered in water or soda, etc. I've only managed one tiny crack in the case after all my abuse. This OLED version is a miracle and a testament to Valve's engineering. \n\nThey did. And this upgrade is more than a refresh because the LCD they used in the first version is really quite mediocre, while the OLED panel was one of the best you could get at the time of release. It's a substantial upgrade that makes a night and day difference with some games.\n\nWe don’t talk about that here.\n\nAlso Valve: turned CS into a slot machine\n\nSteam link was sent from the heavens\n\nIt’s a shame they are discontinued\n\nI never bought a Steam Deck because I was waiting for a second revision of the technology. If they’re telling me to wait for a while, I guess I’m not buying a Steam Deck for a while.\n\nThe OLED Deck is a second revision. The thinner screen, APU update, and memory change allowed for a bigger battery and better power profile. Its also lighter and has some small mods to improve the analog sticks.\n\nJust kept the shell and main specs.\n\nIts not unfair, no sane person would buy a new one every year. Just like no sane person buys a new smartphone every year.\n\nFeel like a lot of people buy gaming laptops and then sell them on eBay.\n\nHow about ones that don't succumb to stick drift in two months?\n\nhow am i seemingly the only one to have never had stick drift on any controller or device\n\nYou probably use it like a human being instead of slamming the plastic thumb sticks as hard as possible every time.\n\nI game with pure rage and frustration\n\nFriend of mine is a mechanic and does other odd jobs that require a lot of grip strength. He can do fine motor tasks like when it comes to soldering really tiny things but handling the sticks? The man goes through 2-3 controllers a year because of stick drift. He even got a “bruh” from a Costco employee because he keeps buying em. \n\nAnother friend of mine had his wife make like a bubble wrap shield around him when he plays video games because he kept making dents in the wall from throwing his controller in frustration during Stardew Valley.\n\nI think that dude should probably find A calmer hobby\n\nIf he does that playing stardew valley, the hobby isn't the issue\n\nOf all games, Stardew Valley? Dude needs some anger management for sure.\n\nImagine marrying a literal child, yeesh\n\nIt would be nice if every controller next generation adopts the Hall Effect sensors since it would get rid of the components, moving against each other that causes degradation and drift. That would fix the problem for most people.\n\nRight there with you bud.\n\nSame for me…everyone I see around consoles screams about stick drift on controllers and I dont even know how that feels 🤣\n\nI’ve avoided it all my life, except just recently my PS5 controller started doing it and it became unusable. Thankfully I have a spare\n\nSame. And I used to go ham on my PS controllers when playing budokai games\n\nBuy a $20 xbox controller off Amazon and use it for a couple months, you'll get it.\n\nEven my actual xbox controller died from it, so now I just buy cheap ones every 6 months or so.\n\nOdd, I haven't had drift on either my LCD launch model, or my OLED launch model.  I play it daily in short bursts.  It is also easy as hell to replace the thumb sticks.  I dropped mine between my bed and frame, and the frame sheered off a stick.  I was in and out in under 30 minutes, 25.00 later.\n\nThe Deck being quite repairable is one of the biggest selling points of it for me. Not only is this thing allowing you to take your PC games with you on the road, it's also designed to last a long time and be easily maintained by the user. \n\nNow, next time you replace one of your sticks, look into hall-effect sticks. There's aftermarket ones for the Deck and they'll reduce the chance of stick drift to essentially zero.\n\nTotally, not to mention it is pretty easy to play games \"other\" ways if you really wanted to, including emulation, but I don't even bother to since steam provides free online play and cloud backups.\n\nI also upgraded the SSD on my 64GB launch model, 100$ 1TB drive and about 45 minutes of work and my LCD has a larger capacity than my 512 GB OLED does.  I haven't opened my OLED yet though, 512 is plenty for a nice collection of games.  I mostly play indie games, but also have Cyberpunk, Halo MCC, and others on there.\n\nYes, I definitely need to upgrade the sticks to hall effects at some point.  Good idea.\n\nIs this a common thing? Maybe I got lucky but my OG deck is still rock solid on the sticks after thousands of hours of use\n\nMy brother uses a Steam Deck as his primary gaming device and even lets his kids play with it and he has never had issues with drift. Also if I remember correctly it is REALLY easy to pop open and replace the sticks if needed, pick up some hall effect sticks for $30 and never worry about it again."

    "all_comment_text": "You look more authentic than the movie.\n\nFr, Gina Gershon was a really odd pick imo. I know she's close to Moxxies age that she's supposed to be in the games, but Moxxi looks a lot younger than her age suggests.\n\nThe actors are all good just none of them are right for the part. It was a cast deemed by a number crunching executive doing a google search for popular actors. \n\nThe best part is since there have been a bunch of profitable game to movie / tv adaptations they can’t blame the video game for why it bombs. \n\nI can’t think of any adaptations that spit on the fan base doing well.\n\nI have to disagree, while a lot of the casting works aside from that they are clearly almost twice the age of the character, i can not and will not accept kevin hart as roland.\n\n&gt;i can not and will not accept kevin hart as roland.\n\nIm with you bud. I think thats the biggest afront to the movie honestly, that and Liliths casting. Like I can make a lot of concessions here and there but these are MAJOR characters in universe. Everything from their actions to their personalities shape how the universe and story moves. And you made Super serious army man the comic relief? With ALL the other characters with comedic value you made the WORST choice for the cheap laugh guy?\n\nAnd while I am on my high horse WHERE THE FUCK IS MORDECAI AND BRICK\n\ni dont even hate cate blanchett as lillith aside from the age. same with curtis as tannis i really think they wouldnt be bad castings aside from being damn near twice the age of characters. i personally am a little over jack black but him as claptrap 100% makes sense. no shade meant either because i know everyone will be ready with their pitchforks and torches, he is a great person and i wish nothing but the best for black but im just tired of his shtick at this point.\n\nI don't get why they didn't just go with claptrap's original voice actor. Like he already exists, just use him. It's not like he needs to do mocap or anything.\n\n\"Hey exe B, you know what will attract more viewers for our movie?\"\n\n\"What, exe A?\"\n\n\"Jack Black!\"\n\nThis all day, same reason we got kevin hart. Thats what makes this feel like such a cash grab as opposed to say the fallout tv series.\n\nThey should've cast the Rock, or Idris Elba, or literally anyone who had the body of a linebacker. Roland certainly wasn't a 5'4\" comedian.\n\n[deleted]\n\nRoland in the dark tower movie that I refuse to believe was created had Idris Elba casted as Roland. \n\nThey should have used this opportunity to cast him as a correct Roland.  As always though, they choose Kevin Hart.\n\nYeah Kevin hart and jack black for clap trap are really poor choices. I like jack black enough but Claptrap does not have jack black type energy.\n\nAlan Tudyk. He could have made a perfect Clappy.\n\nThe problem for me is that Jack Black is just Jack Black always. Every time Claptrap speaks, it will pull me out of this movie.\n\nThe only way Kevin Hart is going to work as Roland is if there's eventually a twist revealing that he's not the *real* Roland. He's a failed clone, or Siren magic messing with everyone's head or something. If they're just playing him straight he's the most miscast character since John Wayne in Gengis Khan.\n\nThey had half the budget for the Rock\n\nThe casting made me realize I hadn't paid enough attention at all to the story in BL 1 &amp; 2 (haven't played the rest).\n\nSomehow I completely missed Moxxi is in her 50-60s with two adult kids.\n\n[deleted]\n\nI couldnt tell you what her eye color is, but I can tell you with surgical precision the angle of the heart tattoo on her breast\n\nScooter and Ellie are her kids.\n\n\nI don't know if there are official ages for the characters, but Ellie is older than Scooter. If Scooter is twenty (and he seems older) and Ellie is just a couple years older, once you factor in time jumps between games, Moxxi ends up being about 50 at the absolute minimum, assuming she had Ellie very young at 15.\n\nAll the actors are ~20 years too old for the roles they're playing. It's like they went with someone's fan-casting from when BL1 launched and they forgot that time passes. \n\nThe whole thing is really weirdly cast. I enjoy Kevin Hart, but he only ever plays himself. He does NOT match Roland.\n\nYeah I'm hoping the vibe for Roland I'm getting from the trailer sticks though the movie. I want the serious Roland we had in the games. If Kevin Hart starts playing himself, it won't be good.\n\nI'm confident in Cate Blanchett as Lilith, Jamie Lee always smashes every role, Jack Black has done plenty of voice acting so I have faith he will do fine.\n\nI guess it's copium because I love the games so much I'm trying not to let the negative views on the movie get to me ahead of time. I'll wait and see the movie and judge it after.\n\n&gt; Jack Black has done plenty of voice acting so I have faith he will do fine.\n\nhe always sounds like Jack Black.\n\nalways.\n\nI thought she was a good choice but time will tell\n\nthe movie is going to be so bad\n\nIt’s a shame because I actually think a lot of several of those actors (Cate Blanchet, Jack Black, etc.) are great in almost everything I see them in, and if I didn’t know more about the game I would be stoked to see them in something together. This is probably exactly why they are cast for these roles, the producers are banking on the general populace seeing their names and not knowing anything else. I just don’t see anyway this ends up being a success though, because if this was their approach to casting, it doesn’t leave me with much hope for the other aspects (writing, directing, etc.)\n\nIt's a tale as old as video game-movie adaptations... production is focusing too much on making the movie \"accessible\" to as many people as possible which will inevitably cause issues with writing and world-building. \n\nIt's not a guarantee, but that's almost universally how the super-high-production adaptations go.\n\nI'm trying to think of a time when producers did that at it succeeded.\n\n\nBut every time they faithfully stick to the source material, it seems like they hit gold. I have no words for how idiotic Hollywood execs are.\n\nProbably a generational thing. Most execs and producers are fairly old, so they don't understand the kind of dedicated fandom that video games tend to attract.\n\nBig problem are the economics behind film making and the shift that streaming has caused. Now almost no profit is made from DVD, and the streaming residuals are much lower than DVD sales were historically. This means they have to pretty much make it all in box office sales, and now post Covid those are down and haven’t really rebounded as much. This all just means the accountants are very focused on “safe” recipes to maximize box office sales, which is what we’re seeing with the superhero films, and game adaptations with big name actors. \n\n1. Agreed OP is amazing\n2. Not sure, i just watched the trailer and that was enough for me. I would stick to the game and fans\n\nThe movie costume looks frikken horrible. \n\nhttps://x.com/BorderlandsFilm/status/1800295884007383088\n\nIn their defence they only had a few million to spend….\n\nHoly shit they missed the mark on the drawing style. The thick black lines in OP cosplay sells it. This just looks terrible.\n\nThe whole movie is just no. as a huge Borderlands fan the movie misses the mark badly.\n\nYou watched it already?\n\nWow, it's always impressive what people can do when they put their mind into it. Great cosplay!\n\nEvery time I see a cell shaded cosplay this good, it always looks like black magic\n\nRight?!\n\nAbsolutely, the amount of details is insane!\n\nI see things like this and I'm like daaaamn people be so talented it's nuts\n\nYeah, completely. I have no idea how I would start to make something just barely remotely looking like this xD\n\nDoesn't even look like a real person.\n\nAmazingly done.\n\nThe best thing for me is that there are (seemingly) no filters on the photo. The costume is so intricately detailed and you can see just how much effort it would have taken.\n\nThis is the height of cosplay, compared to yet another Lara Croft with bigger tits sat in a forest with camera filters and more time spent in photoshop than making the costume. This one is literally snapped in a bathroom. The costume holds its own.\n\nThe hat looks soo cute and the hairstyle is so damn perfect.\n\nThe hair is incredible! I don’t know the games that well but it looks amazing regardless.\n\nThat hair looks like it could stop a bullet.\n\nI'm still bummed the movie doesn't have this same level of detail. I'm sure it's going to suck, but it could have at least looked this good.\n\nwell, because in the movies they have to actually move\n\nWhat about this cosplay implies she can't move? The actors are moving plenty in the same costumes, minus the stylization. This is all paint, makeup, and prosthetics on top of the costume and model.\n\nAlso it's not like the costume crew was going to spend 350 hours on Moxxi's outfit.\n\nWouldnt have taken them that long there’s more than one of them\n\nJust hire 350 costume designers and it only takes 1 hour\n\nI’m just picturing 350 costumers doing one little thing in rapid succession a la the dwarves in lord of the rings.\n\nWell you look fantastic! You could have just popped out of the game.\n\nI'm going to say one positive thing and one negative thing.\n\nPositive: You nailed it!\n\nNegative: I am not a fan of the food Squash.\n\nThat is all.\n\nHad to do a double take when I read \"cosplay\", at first look I thought it was a drawing. Well done, much qudos!\n\nWow, so much effort. You look better than original!\n\nthats really awesome\n\nyou should've had a proper photoshoot in that rather than in the loo\n\nThis is a photo from Comic Con. There was a good light! I will definitely do a photoshoot in the future\n\ndeffo deserves with all the effort you've put in!\n\nThe attention to detail is crazy\n\nYou did a great job! I really love how the wig looks like a game character's hair. You have a talented wigmaker!\n\nBro you can't just take a screenshot of the game and call it a cosplay 🙄\n\nIt's so nice to see that fan's cosplay's absolutely blow away Netflix's costume and makeup department when it comes to characters.\n\nThe cosplay is looking awesome.\n\nIf you don't carry around a tip jar, you're missing a huge opportunity.\n\nFuckin' wooooow!  The IRL cell shading is insane.   Beautifully done.\n\nUses up a whole eyeliner pencil every time.\n\nHow could this possibly take someone 350 hours to complete?\n\nThats working on this, every single day for 42 days straight, 8 hours a day.\n\nGreat job.\n\nYou win!\n\nThat’s fancy!!!\n\nThis is crazy impressive work. Wow!\n\nI’m happy to look at it\n\nThats sick, keep up with what you makes happy\n\nEpic!\n\nWtf its amazing every detail is perfect\n\nLooking good, sugar\n\nPfft, that's nothing. It would take me at least 8500 hours to make that.\n\nthis is absolutely amazing\n\nThat's very impressive!\n\nProud of all your hard work, it looks phenomenal!\n\nWow. People like you amaze me with the amount of skill and talent required for this type of amazing art.\n\nholy cow, this.. this is super awesome! I'm looking at Moxxi irl. such a fantastic job! the movie producer/director should have hired you instead imo.\n\nFABULOUS\n\nLooks great! What part of the cosplay took the longest and/or which took the most effort?\n\nDress, belts, boots... Absolutely every detail! It took me about 30 hours to make one necklace\n\nIncredible. You are very talented.\n\nI like how your colors capture the shaders used in the borderlands game.\n\nincredible\n\nAmazing! You look so good, and it’s such an amazing quality cosplay!\n\nGod daaaumn  that´s hot and epic.\n\nWow amazing job. I’m terrified to imagine some of the messages in your inbox now\n\nOk this one looks amazing\n\nNeat\n\nHoly shit I believe it took 350h!\n\nI randomly get these cosplay posts, this is absolutely straight off of the cell shaded screen. Fuckin kudos to you!\n\nThat's amazing. Great job\n\nIt looks great, now you need to make a custom phone case that matches the theme, as you will almost always have your phone where ever you wear this ;]\n\nDamn, this is deadass the most realistic cosplay I think I’ve ever seen in my life. You did an incredible job.\n\npeak\n\nThe best I've ever seen. Hands down!\n\nThat is impressive work!\n\nHoly hell that looks fantastic\n\nThis is pretty  Effing awesome\n\nI’m always in awe with how cosplayers nail the borderlands look. Amazing.\n\nYou look incredible! 350 hours well spent! Wow wow wow!\n\nExcellent work\n\nLooks amazing and this is much better than what hollywood tried to do. Great job\n\nRIP your inbox\n\nHoly hell that does look like a 350h project\n\nOh my goodness 😍😍😍\n\nAwesome job!\n\nWow, you did a fantastic job.\nGood work.\n\nShe even looks cell-shaded!\n\nJust realized you said 350 HOURS! Holy crap that's dedication! And it turned out great!\n\nMakes me want to keep feeding your tip jar until you give me something nice.\n\ntop tier craftsmanship. are the fishnets body paint?\n\nWow well done!\n\nIt is pretty incredible when I can't tell what I am looking at\n\nThats so realistic can I almoust see the Poligons lol,awesome cosplay\n\nAwesome cosplay!!!\n\nHoly smokes!\n\nDamn you are hot. Great job on the costume.\n\nDamn girl you went above and beyond beyond.\n\nAbsolutely amazing work, respect!\n\nЯ вас видел на комикконе в Астане, у вас просто невероятный косплей, очень за вас болел\n\nThe effort shows, everything Is on point, down to the smallest shadows and colours, this looks amazing\n\nYou look spot on.  Your results are impeccable.\n\nThat’s really impressive.  I can only imagine the amount of work considering the detail.  Pretty wholesome for Moxxi quite honestly.\n\nI'm not a gamer and have no idea what that game is about or who the character is, but this came up in my home feed and I'm glad it did. You look absolutely incredible!!!\n\nThis is absolutely insane, looks better than anything from the movie, really goes to show how much borderlands fans care about the game\n\nLooks legit, great work!\n\nVery well done\n\nThat's very impressive!!! The amount of details is incredible! Fantastic job!!!\n\nI know nothing about boarderlands 3, but this is absolutely insane\n\nyoure making me question how fabric works. well done\n\nThis is so cool!  Great job\n\nGorgeous! Amazing work, you really nailed it. 💕\n\nHot\n\nYo Moxie! , this is truly one of my favorite cosplays I've ever seen. Thanks for brightening my day before a long shitty drive to work.\n\nYes. Please.\n\nSolid, 10/10\n\nIt paid off!\n\nThis is insanely good I don't understand how a person can make something like this\n\nI can imagine how much of a pain it must be to put on the makeup every time you want to wear this costume.\n\nI can’t get over how much you just look like a drawing. It’s incredible.\n\n😍\n\nstunning!\n\nYou could tell me this was a game screenshot and I’d believe you\n\nFireeee 🔥🔥🔥🔥\n\ngosh, i love it when cosplayers make themselves look like graphics. it's always so cool. you look great!\n\nI'm always baffled how some cosplayers pull it of to make the comic style from the games work in real life and actually look like the character in game.\n\nAmazing work! It really was worth the work\n\nActually love you kept the Comic book style of the outfit.\n\nAmazing! INCREDIBLE! Pure art. You’re extremely talented.\n\nIncredible work!\n\nExcellent work.\n\nYou look amazing!\n\nDamn, that's crazy. Good job!!\n\nI... Think I'm in love, lol\n\nWow\n\nUnbelievable. I believe this is the best cosplay I’ve ever seen.\n\ndamn that is so well done, love the hair and that hat\n\nHoly shit, that is worth every hour….\n\nThis is absolutely surreal to look at, makeup and clothing color are spot-on.\n\nwomp womp\n\nThat's ugly\n\ngreat that you included the time taken, but how much did it cost to make\n\nHow did the hair work?\n\nand you took the pic in a bathroom. Classy.\n\nu a women wright?\n\nLooks great!\n\nI’m a fan of details on your costume!! 🙇‍♀️\n\nThe cell shading on your skin!! Omg it's so well done to the tiny details.\n\nI didn't even know you could capture that art style with makeup. That's really cool!\n\nShe has done a great job well done👏👏\n\nThis is absolutely phenomenal the attention to detail is crazy good.\n\nIt shows. Excellent work\n\nActually dope as fuck\n\nI can't even think of a witty comment here, that's just fucking impressive dude\n\nYou put more time into this cosplay than they did in the movie - amazing work\n\nI was once in an elevator with Brina Palencia, the voice actress who plays Moxxi. I said hi, and she said hi back. Pretty much the highlight of my life.\n\nWooow! My dream!!\n\nDamn, you did really well with the makeup!\n\nThat's amazing! I wish I could up vote 100 times.\n\nThis is incredible!!\n\nI wish I had half the ability to sink time into a project I love like this\n\nIt's amazing!! You look absolutely incredible, I hope you're proud ♥️\n\nyou look amazing\n\nExcellent. It is honestly hard to tell at a glance what is physical vs painted. Impressive."

Saw them a few times. Top memories was them at Astroworld, when it was still a theme park, playing Deep In the Heart of Texas until someone brought them a snow cone. Another was them getting just pelted with bags of skittles and combos to the point that they had to stop and ask people to knock it off. Fun times.\n\nThe best version.\n\nCore memory unlocked\n\nI thought this was a bowling animation\n\nOmg you are so right ahah !!\n\nr/bowlingalleyscreens\n\nYes, or Corridor Crew's slightly offensive bowling animations, I love those!\n\nNever did get to see how far across the line Jordan actually went.\n\nOh, good point, that was the one that was deemed \"too offensive\" to release, a shame\n\nWas that the one that definitely _sounded_ like domestic abuse?\n\nYes. There were multiple in the history of the series that \"crossed the line\". Sam's middle eastern one is another example.\n\nMade me immediately think of VeggieTales.\n\nWe are the piiiirates, who don’t do anythinnnng.\n\nEdit: so you all can get it stuck in your heads, too\nhttps://youtu.be/XaWU1CmrJNc?feature=shared\n\nDAMN YOU! \\*angry upvote\\* Have you heard the metal version?

LittleBigPlanet had a costume where you'd play as the two dimensional stickman from the earliest physics prototype they had.\n\nIt’s a lil different but I love how in the resident evil 2 remake you can wear a skin that turns you into the original 1998 low-poly PS1 character model.\n\nAnd one of the ore-order DLC’s was the outfit of a character from the prototype. \n\nIt was however, utter bollocks that RE3make dropped the ball on costumes. No Regina, No Low Poly, hell Carlos only gets a haircut.\n\nHitman WOA has this as well, an unlockable suit that turns you into the low poly Agent 47 from the first game\n\nThanks for this, I never understood why there was such a ridiculous price for the most shabby cosmetic available.  \nNow it makes sense!\n\nThat was my first goal In game. That's my motivation, I find something expensive I covet then thats my goal for the new few weeks/months.\n\nYep. With the gilded voyages happening now, I finally was able to afford the complete Dark Adventurers Ship Set. I saved until I had enough to buy it all at once. 37.8 million gold total. Months of grinding. \n\nI don’t even like the ship set that much, but it’s nice to have the most expensive thing in the game bought… I put it on a galley for my guild and I’ll rarely run it. \n\nNow to finish buying all those stupid cherished fishing trinkets.\n\nDidn't know about that !\n\nIt's very strange. Sea of theives seems like it was out for much longer than 2018.\n\nAnd now I know Sea of Thieves released on my birthday.\n\nI think I've seen this episode of ReBoot.\n\nBest show\n\nThey also released a Reboot game on the original Playstation I think. I played the hell out of it as a kid, probably wasn't even a good game.\n\nIt was a great time, that show was awesome. I rewatched it when i was older and still loved it. It was corny but much better than other older shows i liked that were much more corny lol\n\nGod i miss that show. It's supposedly been trying to get a reboot no pun intended but last i heard it was in copyright hell lol ugh 😩\n\nIt's on Netflix, it's very different but has some of the characters I think.  Pretty sure Megabyte is mentioned at least.\n\nhttps://www.imdb.com/title/tt6849940/?ref_=ext_shr\n\nOmg they made a high school teenage drama on top of it. Awful!\n\nLooks like an actual island that is in the game right now.\nI want to say Smugglers Bay, but not super confident on my island names yet.\n\nYep, that's Smuggler's Bay, alright.\n\nIt’s an early version of smugglers bay. Less sand, more grass and the top of the islands is all stone.\n\nYeah sometimes the developers make the base game then sink into visuals (lets say character models and animations) later as the more important thing comes first, or as some say you eat the frog in the morning.\n\n[removed]\n\nYou see it pop up on here from time to time, most famously the “science based 100% dragon MMO” where an aspiring game dev posts all the work they have put into their game so far and it’s literally just a collection of concept art. \n\nThe gaming equivalent of the friend who approaches you saying “you know how to code right?” And then does you the favor of bringing you in on their amazing app where all you need to do is program it. 5% share of the company dude. I already did all the heavy lifting, i came up with the *idea*.\n\n\"science based 100% dragon MMO\" had to be one of the funniest set of threads I've ever seen, she got torn apart. I think the dev is still active on here too.\n\nShe got torn apart... eventually. I was early enough to the thread to remember all the highly upvoted comments saying how awesome her \"game\" was.\n\nHahah yea dude it was peak reddit\n\nHow do I revisit this timeline? Sauce?\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/p1ssv/dear_internet_im_a_26_year_old_lady_whos_been/\n\nNah she stopped being active 7 years ago\n\nThe top comment was a dev. That’s who I think they are referring to. I wouldn’t call that OP a dev.\n\n&gt;You see it pop up on here from time to time, most famously the “science based 100% dragon MMO” where an aspiring game dev posts all the work they have put into their game so far and it’s literally just a collection of concept art. \n\nW...who the hell is doing this?\n\nAight nevermind I found it, wtf were those dragons.\n\nAfaik the dragons were fine, but you can't make a game with just concept art and design documents.\n\nIdk dude, those things looked like they belonged on a very cracked episode of \"Xavier: Renegade Angel.\"\n\nThey looked like they had seen some shit. Like I get being amateur and having a cool setting, but Holy FUCK did she come in half assed.\n\nWow, forgot about the dragon mmo. I hope she's doing well.\n\nOr a triple A studio*\n\n*AAAA studio\n\nRare is a AAA studio\n\nDepends. All of the preproduction teams I've seen have been mostly design and programming, but there's usually a couple artists on board to show proof-of-concept visually as well.\n\nOfcourse. Different departments and all that. But a programmer isn't gonna start building mechanics with the final assets, even if they have already been made.\n\nI've seen a few games built around a fancy new graphics tech they developed, like Noita.\n\nOr games built from the ground-up as tech demos to showcase graphics hardware, like Crysis.\n\nEh noita is more than graphics. The graphics are tied into its functionality.\n\nThat’s definitely true, but at the same time it can be really important to find the aesthetics and theme of your game, which might lead to very different (and more fun) gameplay design than you had envisioned. This is basically what happened during the development of [Thumper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckm8_SEIXQM).\n\n*Star citizen enters chat* 😂😂\n\nNah it really doesn't. Star Citizen did not begin with the final assets and it currently doesn't have the final assets for a lot of things. The early access model requires some things be polished up earlier than it otherwise would, but you'd be mistaken to believe that the game didn't go through similar whitebox gameplay as shown here. We've seen plenty of whitebox images throughout the years.\n\nThis is pretty much the standard AFAIK. I have heard the phrase \"if your game isn't fun with minimalist graphics, it won't be fun polished either.\"\n\n\"What if we add Ray-tracing?!\"\n\nThat really should be how it is all the time. No point in putting a ton of effort into graphics when you don't even know if your game is fun yet.\n\nIt _is_ done pretty much all the time, especially with new IPs. Studios build a series of demos over a few weeks/months and decide which one they like the best (if they like any of them), then work on making that into a full game. A more directed approach happens when making sequels where teams often toy around with new mechanics, but it still happens\n\nin this case they went ahead with the graphics anyway\n\nWorth noting that this prototype was made in Unity and Sea of Thieves was developed in Unreal.  With a unique and risky game like this, I am sure they needed to multiplayer playtest it first to understand whether it will be *fun* and find an audience before committing to focus the team and redevelop it in UE.\n\nlol, I suspected as much - those pill shapes are the default shape for any first person entity in Unity, dunno about Unreal.\n\nSometimes? Always.\n\n&gt; or as some say you eat the frog in the morning\n\n???\n\nThe idea that if you have a plate of food, and one thing is a frog, if you eat that first you can then relax and enjoy the food without worrying about having to eat a frog at the end of it.\n\nIt's basically an idiom for \"get the less fun stuff out of the way first\".\n\nI’m too lazy to google, but the concept is if you eat a frog in the morning, there’s nothing much worse that can happen to you that day.  It’s shorthand for saying the devs are getting the crunchy non-glamorous stuff out of the way first before the “fun” stuff like graphics and artwork. At least that’s how I took the reference to mean.\n\nSometimes? Try every single time\n\nThis is how nearly every game ever is made.\n\nYep... Gameplay is king !\n\nIf a game is good with spheres, capsules and cubes then it'll be good with graphics.\n\nGameDev 101\n\nIndeed my friend!\n\nThis design reminds me of mighty beanz and crazy bones toys from the 90s\n\nif your game is not fun when it looks like this, it wont be fun with fancy graphics either.\n\nI would’ve preferred these bean guys as the main character designs\n\nSea of Beans\n\nThose guys have that mustache.  This is obviously Sea of Evil Beans.\n\nBea of beans: Bay of Beany Baes\n\nVeggie tales\n\nIt's like veggietales but instead if vegetables, they're prescription medications\n\nThere’s still Larry Boy and the Bad Apple on the PS2.\n\nLeisure Suit Larry and the Roofie Boyz\n\nAh yes The sea of Tic-Tac's or maybe Sea of Beans.\n\nSea of Beans sounds better\n\nThis is what I tell people who are game designing. Don’t get bogged down in assets at the start. A block shooting a block at a block is a game. Assets get updated over time.\n\n'Sea of Tic Tacs,' starring Cap'n Candy sailing the high seas on Ol' Jolly Peppermint!\n\nSea of suppositories\n\nSuppo-sea-tories\n\nEnema-ones\n\nAnd last but not least... Poop deck.\n\nWe are the piiii-rates who don’t do anything.  We just stay at home, and lay around.  If you ask us to do anything, we’ll just tell you “we don’t do anything.”\n\nI love the veggie tales vibes I’m getting from this.\n\nFor those who are interested, Rare made a Documentary about SoT not too long ago, completely free and fun to watch. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNGj9TEu754](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNGj9TEu754)\n\nNice thanks !\n\nI played this.\nAnd the core game fun was evident even in the prototype.\n\n[Hmm…](https://kingdomjc.com/soft/Graf/09.jpg)\n\nIt's a crime that we still don't have a proper vegetales game.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VeggieTales#Video_games\n\nPotato gaming at it's finest\n\nGameplay first, always.\n\nIf the game isn't just boxes and capsules during prototype, then I am concerned. This is the way.\n\nTeam Buddies? Nah, Crew Mateys 👌\n\nVeggie Tales cross over?\n\nIs that a map of Voya Nui?!\n\nTic Tac-piraka\n\nVeggie Tales?\n\nOne of the figureheads you can unlock for your ship is a reference to these character models!\n\nYeah guys this is how video games are made.\n\nIf I see a game that looks like this in year one I'm breaking my Do Not Preorder rule.\n\nNot gonna lie, as a game programmer that's a pretty decent looking prototype visually speaking. It's fascinating how quickly swapping out some art assets takes a game from something like this to release quality. Normally I'd expect the ship wouldn't even have individual stairs, or those nails/bolts on the cannons. Just crappy box/pill coder art.\n\nFucking TicTacs searching the onepiece I cant😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂\n\n[deleted]\n\nNever feel bad about your game !\n\nThey should make the game look like this on April 1st\n\n[removed]\n\nWell that's amazing\n\ncaptain... LOOOOK\n\nTampon commercial?\n\nwould be an amazing april fools joke if they just switched the ship and player graphics to these for a day lol\n\nTic Tac Pirates\n\nSea of Bimpson\n\nLore accurate for \"Pirates of the Carri-beans\"\n\nThey about to raid Voya Nui?\n\nDont let the hater of the leaked gts see that.  It will shatter their world\n\nRemember when GTA VI's leaks first happened and a bunch of know-nothing internet dwellers shouted about graphics being the first thing finished and that it looked awful? Absolute fools, the lot of 'em.\n\n\"Prototype without art\" ... I guess \"prototype with funny art\" works as well XD\n\nSmuggler's reef never changed a bit\n\nthe one holding the map kinda looks like plankton from spongebob\n\nYes, that literally what \"prototype\" means. Look up gray-boxing.\n\nAt least the Clippy artist landed on their feet\n\nsea of beans\n\nWe could have had a free roam veggie tales pirate game\n\nIt's 2024. If you told me this was a picture of an indie game that just surpassed the sales of Elden Ring, I'd believe you.\n\nI must play this\n\nLooks like Smugglers' Bay.\n\nI'm far more likely to play this, honestly.\n\nLooks like a much more interesting game already than what we actually ended up with.\n\nVeggietales - Jonah and the Whale\n\nSea of Beans\n\nLooks like some veggie tales kinda stuff.\n\ndamn what sexy penguin\n\nPlankton?\n\nNo, this is Patrick\n\nPatrick, that's Plankton.\n\nPlankton convinced his cousins to turn to a life of piracy with the promise of ~~root beer~~ rum.\n\nAlso, Mr Krabs is definitely rejoining the navy to hunt down Plankton\n\nIt was better like this\n\nWhen the prototype is better than an AAAA game.\n\nI unironically would prefer this\n\nIs this image suggesting there were more than 4 players per ship at one point?\n\nTicTac marketing dropped the ball here in letting that game go xD\n\nSea of Suppositories had such a better ring to it.\n\nGotta start somewhere\n\nSurprisingly, the ship looks familiar to what we see now in the game.\n\nMan this is what my pills must do whenever I’m away.\n\nIs it a game? Looks pretty funny\n\nlooks better than what they eventually released.\n\nJesus Vegetable Movies!\n\nLooks like a bowling animation when you get a strike\n\n\"🎵Welcome to Happy Burger where burgers are served with a *smile* 🎵\"\n\nToo Many Weapons new map just dropped\n\nBetter than skull &amp; bones"

[Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0btcOekQVI)\n\nHer [default skin](https://imgur.com/a/sBszoHG) isnt that much better but it is still better than the alternative\n\nOriginal does looks better. The paid one looks like a cross with some Aquaman movie.\n\nShe looks like an angry gumball machine\n\nI assumed this was some alternate Black Manta\n\nWow. Like why tho?\nThis paid outfit looks considerably worse. What does this achieve? No one is going to buy this, even if they were a fan of the game oor character. \n\n\n:/\n\nVery possible it was just an option that was designed during concept, they chose one but there's others that are fully done and ready to monetize if they want.\n\nMrs. Freeze? \n\n....okay....\n\nYes just turn Victor into Victoria easy peasy.\n\nNot sure if it's her, but apparently in the current comics Mr Freeze finally saved his wife, and she's a complete psycho who dumped him for being a pussy.\n\nsounds like my ex woo\n\n[deleted]\n\nNope, she's a lesbian and Nora still needs saving. Victoria Frias. They gave her the iconic video game lesbian haircut to boot. The variation of shaved sides with short to long hair on top.\n\nIt's not even multiverse fuckery. Just comic books running dry on storylines.\n\nCurrent storylines (past 4 years or so) have Mr. Freeze actually succeeding in curing her cancer. But, part of the cure was using the same treatments that turned him all blue and icy.\n\nEdit: Before the current reboot, Freeze had saved her once before. But, in that comic run she got the power to control fire and reanimate the dead. So... Mrs. Freeze actually makes more sense than that.\n\nWas she called Mrs. Flame?\n\nThat looks like fucking Elton John\n\nDamn, that default skin is insulting to LGBT women.\n\nI was going to ask if she was gay because they give every single gay woman that hairstyle lmao\n\nSeriously, it’s butch stereotype.\n\nIt's her Arkham costume but with the armor removed, they definitely should not have given the option to remove the armor. With the armor it just looks like a slightly worse version of Mr. Freeze's suit from the Arkham games, without it, this.\n\nMan we both being fucked with dawg\n\nAbsolutely not. It is. $20\n\n😂 why don't they want to make money?\n\nIt has to be money laundering or something. Tax evasion. Insurance scam? It can't be a genuine attempt to make a profit.\n\n[removed]\n\nIt's obviously both. WB will be like \"Well this game didn't do as good as we thought.\" FRANK!!! Fire up the calculators so we can claim this shit as a loss and so I get a 50 million dollar bonus next quarter.\n\nwhistle gold swim north direction soup bright expansion like employ\n\nI prefer the bimbos tbh at least they get combined woth bimbros.  Hunky men and women beaing all hunky together.\n\n&gt;bimbros\n\nNever heard that one before. I thought the term used was 'himbo'.\n\nIts called gender equality. If the women get to be hot, so do the men.\n\nAll I can say is I throughly enjoyed Deadpool 2.\n\nThis is the cope I huff every day\n\nHanlon's Razor says to avoid attributing malice to what is adequately explained by incompetence.\n\nI think them being tonedeaf and thinking DC = free money (not completely unreasonably, mind you) is simpler than anything malicious.\n\nI'm starting to see so many bad cosmetics being added to games that I'm starting to think they're doing it on purpose to make more expensive ones seem more appealing. Like \"Look, you could get this lame $5 skin but for just a few dollars more you can get this sweet ass legendary skin!\"\n\nI don't know what WB was thinking putting all that money in a game that was an obvious flop waiting to happen\n\nDid they even use their patented Nemesis system in this one? It seems like it would be perfect in their superhero games, but I don't really hear about it beyond that the games are universally shit.\n\nNo other games outside of the Middle Earth games have used the nemesis system and both of those games are great. \n\nIt’s supposed to be in the Wonder Woman game. That would be the first not named Shadow of Mordor or Shadow of War.\n\nIt's a great system, I played both of the Mordor games several times each and it really gave each run its own flavor. I wish they hadn't just sat on it for this long or just licensed it out cheap so other, more competent, companies could do something fun with it.\n\nI can't believe they managed to fucking patent it lol. Must have been greasing some palms on the committee that day.\n\nUsually when you patent things you do it for money. But these people have just sat on it. They could have printed money if they used it in games. I really don't understand why.\n\n\"ITS MY IP TO SIT ON AND DO NOTHING WITH\"\n\nRandy Pitchford owning Duke Nukem in a nutshell.\n\nSony &amp; Bloodborne 😔\n\nThey patented it so that other people couldn't make money off it.\n\nThey could have easily licensed it for a reasonable fee and made some money off of more games they didn't have to commit millions of dollars toward in development.\n\n*Some* money is not *all* the money.\n\nIt's like that Namco patent on Minigames in loading screens that they did fuck all with for 20 years and by the time it expired loading screens were already too short for anyone to bother gamifying them. \n\nMy theory is because a patent is an asset, and having the patent means they can list it, and it's supposed value, as part of the company/studio's total value.\n\nHuh. This actually makes a lot of sense. They could still license it on case by case basis, but maybe it is more complicated than that.\n\nYou would value a patent based on what you expect to earn off of it. \n\nIf you're not licensing it out or using it, that's going to be a low number.\n\nthis way they have it when they feel like using it and there aren't several competing indie games making it look bad when they deliver an aggressively mediocre example of it years later\n\n&gt;They could have printed money if they used it in games. I really don't understand why.\n\nBecause then other people would be printing money with their system. Capitalism 101 is even if you don't intend on using a resource you must abuse the legal system to ensure no one else gets too, especially if this negatively affects the consumer.\n\nI don't even understand what the patent is in this case. Is it the software code itself? Because if it's just the 'concept' of a nemesis for the main character, I don't understand how there aren't dozens of 'rival', 'arch-enemy', 'challenger' and etc systems already which totally aren't the nemesis system *wink wink, nudge nudge*.\n\nIt’s insane to me they don’t license it out. They could be making so much money.\n\nAnd allow other companies to illustrate how much better they are when given access to the same resources!\n\nIt's also amazing how greed makes these people both shitty AND terrible at their jobs.\n\nThey fought for years to do it, and from what I understand the patent is insanely specific to the point where even the slightest deviation from their exact system would be enough to avoid infringement; the problem is that no one wants to actually risk getting into a legal battle with WB even if they are likely to win due to the time and money it would cost them.\n\nI can't believe they still charge $50 for a 7 year old game and all 6 DLC's are full price ($120 additional).\n\nRANGER!!\n\nMANSWINE!!!!\n\nThey actually developed that system for a Dark Knight Batman game but they cancelled the game so it wouldn’t compete with the Arkham Games\n\nRandom Gotham Thug with his head stapled crudely back onto his neck: BATMAN!\n\nNemesis system does make sense with bad guys coming back since Batman doesnt kill, just beats them into a pulp.\n\nAh yes, the Wonder Woman game everyone is clamoring for.  Someone should tell Zsaslav the Nemesis system is valuable so he’ll sell it.\n\nIt's such a a shame because Warframe was actively developing its own Nemesis System when the copyright went through. They had to hard pivot a few months before release, and it severely effected the final product. \n\nWB did the industry a serious injustice by copyrighting an incredible game system then never using it again. Like, what's even the point?\n\nFrom what I’ve heard they have the system running for Wonder Woman but like every other aspect of the game is a mess right now\n\nThe nemesis system would be hilarious in a Batman game. That one jobber you beat into a red paste 5 hours ago with a 200 hit combo coming back for revenge like a sub boss\n\nI knew I shouldn't have been throwing assholes into that pit of chemicals over and over.\n\nRobin: \"Maybe, Batman, we should just kill them?\"\n\nBatman: \"No, we can't stoop to their level\"\n\nthe man who got punched repeatedly in the head and his face burned off with acid plotting revenge in the background: (ง •̀_•́)ง\n\nOmg, that would be crazy, enemies you defeated, gain superpowers, and come after you. Maybe have multiple different types of powers, similar to the traits from the Shadow series, with counter tech to each.\n\nIsn't the nemesis system just enemies that beat you getting power ups?\n\nIt basically means that enemies are unique and random. A grunt that kills you gains his own personality and will almost definitely make fun of you for that almost every time he sees you.\n\nAlong with that, enemies remember their interactions with you, no matter their results. If you \"kill\" them and survive, they will remember how you killed them last time. They may have learned to avoid or be immune to that kind of attack, or fear that attack so much that they are dazed any time it is used on them.\n\nThe final aspect is just that your actions have consequences on these randomized, unique npcs. By killing a leader, another random guy that you've never interacted with now becomes a leader.\n\nIt's mainly the uniqueness of the npcs and the fact that this uniqueness is influenced by your actions that makes this nemesis system so popular and sought after. Also the reason it was patented.\n\nThe only team that seems to want to use it is Monolith. They're fine sharing it to the other studios under WB (I think the Damien game was going to use it? Don't quote me), but no one else there wants to use it. \n\n\nThe Wonder Woman game is going to use it though. So that's something.\n\nI get so angry they horde that patent\n\nHow the fuck did they patent a game concept though, there should be a review process by the patent office so people don’t need to have $4 billion to contest this obvious mishap\n\nIt's been in development for like 10 years, they lost their golden goose with Arkham. Gotham Knights flopped despite multiple people on the project telling them they were not going to hook their 'Arkhamverse' players with a crafting focused co-op game, and then it didn't work and they did it AGAIN.\n\nPeople high up at WB Games have been brain dead for a while, they keep hiring people with like...a Business Bachelor's Degree to be the lead of a game dev department. I used to work there, and I can promise it's not just them these days.\n\nAnd then they doubled down on live service! Despite the fact Hogwarts Legacy, a single player game, was the best selling game the year it released\n\nEven more baffling is they had already seen Marvel’s Avengers crash, burn, explode, and finally crumble to ash. They saw how incredibly badly it could go and they still went “bet!”\n\nThe only positive thing about Marvel’s Avengers was its campaign. The story itself was good fun, and if they had released that campaign minus all the grindy, gimmicky, GaaS looter shit it could have been a legitimately fun game.\n\nSo Avengers’ only positive note is its campaign, Hogwarts Legacy makes great sales, all the feedback they get from players and reviewers is that single player is getting well received. They’ve had great results with Shadows of Mordor and Batman: Arkham, and despite **all of this** they still decide to push on with this shit show.\n\nThey pulled the plug on the Batgirl movie, when it was basically finished, but not THIS?!\n\nJust another case of “how hard can a game as a service be!?” Typical service game trash.\n\n- Sunk Cost Fallacy (almost 9 years of Rocksteady development I believe)\n- Recoup *any* development costs (see above)\n- Unfounded faith in the popularity of their characters (specifically Suicide Squad)\n- Big Eyes for that Live Service bag (many failures, but the Live Service titles that *do* survive make so, so much money)\n- Coming off of *the* most financially successful game of 2023 (Hogwarts Legacy, which actually outsold CoD, the first title to do so in at least 5 years)\n- Of course, out of touch management that shoehorned Rocksteady into a third-person-shooter live service in the first place\n\n\nI wouldn’t call it’s failure a historic one, but definitely one of the most predictable. You could see the game being terrible years in advance from miles away, and if you were paying attention you could catch most of the above reasons why it *would* launch exactly *how* it did before the game even dropped.\n\nLive Service = money  \nDC = popular = money\n\nSo they probably only thinked about how many dollars a DC live service game can produce\n\nThe funny thing is I've been playing it (got it on a steep sale), and it reminds me a LOT of Marvel: Avengers as well.\n\nGeneric looter-shooter with a superhero \"skin\", wide as an ocean with tons of missions and sheer map to explore and lots of little details in the background that you KNOW someone worked really hard on...but deep as a puddle with you fighting the same enemies 90% of the time with visual confetti and constant explosions and about a dozen different resources to track.\n\nIt's like they both made the exact same mistake with Live Service games, lol.\n\nThere's some mindless fun to be had, but it's also kind of sad to see all the work that went into certain details of the game (I wandered the Daily Planet offices at one point just reading the _articles_ the staff had written on Brainiac's invasion before they fled), when the core premise was always going to be so shit.\n\nTheir \"hurdurr we're making everything live service\" announcement last year was an enormous facepalm moment. It's hard to believe that no one stood up and \"This is going to fail big time.\"\n\n*It isn't about the money, it's about sending a message*...\n\nWhat the hell is that\n\nGender bent, lesbian Mr. Freeze.  Victoria Freeze is the name  I think.\n\nIf only there was an ice themed female DC villain they could've used, would've been killer\n\nNice pun. But in all seriousness, imagine having [this character](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/arkhamcity/images/6/6e/Batman-assault-on-arkham-avi_snapshot_00-29-49_2014-07-31_16-18-01.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20140805031400) in your archive and not using it. It's even IN THE SAME GAME UNIVERSE.\n\nIt’s mind boggling to me how botched the game play was from the word go. Rather than give us a satisfying roster of Suicide Squad members they decide to turn everyone into gunmen.\n\nKing shark should have been a melee brawler not a fuckin’ mini gun mobile turret.\n\nBoomerang’s boomerangs should BE his ranger weapons, not guns.\n\nIf they were so hell bent on just making it exclusively Borderlands with a DC veneer then just make it TaskForce X instead of Suicide Squad. Have them pull together Redhood, Huntress, Deathstroke, and Rick Flagg and have it be a government hitsquad tasked with bringing down the mind controlled league! \n\nDon’t completely bastardize established characters because you don’t want to make the effort to individualize gameplay!\n\nToo hot\n\nI get a blank Pic, is that the joke?\n\nIt was supposed to be a link to [https://arkhamcity.fandom.com/wiki/Batman:\\_Assault\\_on\\_Arkham?file=Batman-assault-on-arkham-avi\\_snapshot\\_00-29-49\\_2014-07-31\\_16-18-01.jpg](https://arkhamcity.fandom.com/wiki/Batman:_Assault_on_Arkham?file=Batman-assault-on-arkham-avi_snapshot_00-29-49_2014-07-31_16-18-01.jpg)\n\nGot it. Yeah I need to go back rewatch that one\n\nWith pants on, mister!\n\n[deleted]\n\nThe point was to make her gay.\n\nSo pandering to nobody?\n\nNot nobody. Not the customer either, but definitely not to nobody.\n\nI'm almost positive lesbian woman didn't ask for this, either.\n\nLooks like Mimi from the Drew Carey show.\n\nLeast mimi was likeable comparatively\n\n\"make her lame and gay\"\n\nIt's so fucking cliche to make a male character into a lesbian.  South Park officially killed the idea. \n\nPut a chick in it and make her gay!!!\n\nif that's my wife, you can leave me in whatever freeze accident i'm tragically stuck in.\n\nOh. And here I thought Mr freeze grew some moobs.\n\n&gt;What the hell is that\n\nObligatory: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2gNx4-REIA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2gNx4-REIA)\n\nIs that you Sandy?\n\n\"What, it's just an ordinary skin-OH MY GOODNESS! Squidward!\"\n\n10/10 reference\n\nWhich one of you is the real Dirty Dan?\n\nHi\n\nWho the hell decided to put Kim Jong Un in a frozen space suit?\n\nThis is a good one.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger is a better freeze then this\n\nBavtman ! Wat killed da dinozors ? Ze ize age !\n\n🤢 good god, take me back to 2015 arkham\n\nI guess they decided it was a complete and total train wreck so no point in trying to change course.\n\nWhy continue pouring money into it though?\n\nContracts were already signed. This is drip feed of the remaining content before they turn off the servers.\n\nDo you genuinely think they spent any real amount of money on this?  Look at it.\n\nSadly yes\n\n98% of live service games losing whole playerbase in first couple of months and ending up as huge flop.\n\nDead husks in business suits that sit on top in video game corporations: \"Lets make a live service game and make it as greedy and obnoxious as possible!\"\n\nThey just gave it away for free with Prime Days recently and I’m happy to be able to try it out for free but it really highlights why I wouldn’t pay money for it.\n\nParts of it are nice but it just doesn’t gel. And a whole chunk of the beginning is a lot of Justice League lore dumping that just makes me think about the game I would rather be playing than the one they made.\n\nBecause when they work it's printing money more than all their other games combined for years to come.\n\nWhy does Mr. Freeze have boobs\n\nBecause it's an else world Mrs Freeze, who happens to be a lesbian. My question is why did they give her the stereotype butch lesbian body?\n\nThat's how lesbians look according to devs\n\nso inclusive to use stereotypes of minorities!!!\n\nI swear half of the corporate “inclusivity” just preys on stereotypes of underrepresented people for a quick buck\n\n\"We need it to be immediately obvious who we're attempting to ~~pander to~~ represent, so we have to use stereotypes so that people will effortlessly see them in the marketing.\"\n\nThey maybe think it will get them a quick buck but there are FAR MORE people who don’t want this then people who do (the people who do usually aren’t even gamers but political activists).\n\nIf by half you mean 100% then yes.\n\nApparently they think every lesbian is manly, obese and ugly? Very inclusive of them and not at all offensive and generalizing.\n\nShe looks like she farted and she’s stuck in her own fart cloud 💨\n\nWhat is that?\n\nWHAT THE FUCK IS THAT?!\n\nApparently an alternate timeline Mr freeze now genderbent.\n\nwait, how is it an alternate timeline? isnt-ah fuck it. im tired of asking questions for this garbage game.\n\nThe game is about multiverses, why is it always multiverses\n\nIt looks like Grandma the fuckin thing!\n\na jelly donut sir!\n\nAll other issues aside: how is she supposed to move those goggles onto/off of her eyes, if she can't take take the helmet off?

I mean, how didn't a single person at Rocksteady realize how fucking stupid it looks?\n\nThe thing that blows my mind is this had to go through several different levels of development, all costing time and money, and no one was willing to stand up and be like \"Yeah no one's going to buy this\".\n\nBut maybe I'm wrong. Maybe even Suicide Squad has some whales willing to just hit \"Buy All\" every patch regardless of quality.\n\nEWWW\n\nThey pay us to wear it, right?\n\nWhy are the servers still online for that game?\n\nI genuinely don’t believe it.

    "all_comment_text": "Online gaming has been toxic for as long as I can remember\n\nYeah I remember playing counter strike circa 2001, and it was just as filled with asshole teenagers saying edgy shit. PvP games have always been a mix of fun players and toxic ones.\n\nIf you wanted a more welcoming community, MMOs were better and probably still are.\n\nI dunno\n\nI remember barrens chat\n\nDid somebody say [Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker]?\n\nAnal[Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker]\n\n\"[Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker] in bed\" was popular on my server.\n\n\"Anal \\[Dirge\\]\" was popular on mine.\n\nI'll admit to being a teenager once lol. I found a rare BoE ring called \"Ring of Pain\" and instead of use or sell it I kept it in my bags for whenever people started linking different abilities and items.\n\nWhats the origin of adding Anal before random items?\n\nGather round kids Gather round. Let grandpa Mortalcoil1 tell you a story.\n\nThe early level Alliance zones in WoW were smaller, better looking, had better lore. LVL 10ish to 25ish were over 3 zones in the Alliance.\n\nThe Horde had The Barrens. An enormous, ugly boring zone that they would stay in for days, if not weeks, or months, or even a year (clap clap clap clap)\n\nNoobs got bored. Addendum. We were all noobs back then. \n\nI remember the exact week that people figured out how to link items in general chat.\n\nJust like any new toy, people went hard on it. It went from nobody linking anything to constant links, and of course, people started linking the best gear in the game. It kept us motivated.\n\nAgain, lots and lots of people, gigantic boring zone. This is how we passed the time in The Barrens. Jokes about Mankrik's wife, Chuck Norris, and linking random shit.\n\nEventually somebody thought it would be funny to link an item like \"beads\" or something with anal before it.\n\nWe were all bored and tired of The Barrens, but there wasn't really anywhere else to go, so the joke caught on like wildfire.\n\nPeople kept finding more and more funny, and then ironic, etc. etc. items to link in chat with the word anal before it.\n\nAs was the style at the time.\n\n New person: Where is mankriks wife?\n Vet   Horde:  Heaven!\n\nShe died doing what she loved, being miles away from the quest giver.\n\nWas it AliBaba that had the map for that quest literally pointing to her body using corpses for the arrow\nThat could be seen from way up high?  \n\nI know my favorite screen shot was someone that was so sick of it in Barren’s chat he hopped on his max level alliance character and kited Mankirk to her body so he could kill him next to her. \n\nHe, of course, was teabagging Mankirk while dancing.\n\nWhoa whoa whoa. This is Barren's chat, not your quest log. It's gonna be spelled \"mankirk\".\n\nNGL, never have I ever played WoW. I stayed and read this tale. Good for you 👏👏👏👏 thanks for the story time.\n\nGood times. Barrens Chat while auto running was what kept the boredom away.\n\nMy original character was alliance and every time i tried to make a horde character i got into the barrens and my will to continue just died. Props to anyone who could make it through that shit.\n\nPeople used to shit on the Horde for the idiotic Barrens chat.\n\nI'm always like, no motherfucker! That's The Barrens' fault for seemingly being custom designed as some sort of psychological experiment to drive people insane!\n\nThis reminds me of leveling in Sebilis for the first EverQuest expansion: Ruins of Kunark. Back then, the exp curve was messed up, so there were a few levels that required way more exp than others. Originally it was L44 which took around 6 hours per \"bubble\" (20% of a level) to hit L45. most did in SolusekB. Levels before that were 6hrs for the entire level.\n\nThat was child's play compared to L54 in Kunark.\n\nIt took around a week at 6hrs a day for one bubble. At that rate it was 4-6 WEEKS to hit L55. And there were higher level mobs there to take you all the way to L60. So most people spent months in Sebilis.\n\nBecause of that, the chat could be quite demented at times due to everyone losing their collective minds at being in the same zone for that long. Especially before the days of voice chat, so everyone was a captive audience.\n\nYep. Our guild quit EQ and moved to WoW the day it came out.\n\nI know exactly what you are talking about.\n\nYou are referring to hell levels. lvl 40, 45, 50, etc.\n\nYou might already know this, but when EQ first came out, there was no blue line in your XP bar. It was just the yellow bubs, as was the nomenclature.\n\nSo many GM's had to answer people's bug questions that their XP bar was broken because it was no longer moving at lvl 40, the first hell level that they added the blue line to show that, yes, you were actually getting XP.\n\nGod. Karnor's Castle was the *worst* zone to lvl in. Constant trains to zone.\n\nbut Sebilis didn't have an easy exit so there would be times times that a train to the entrance would get stuck there and a guild would have to come in and clear it out.\n\nFun times! but IMHO, EQ didn't really find itself until Planes of Power, and I understand some people *hated* PoP for making the game too easy.\n\nSome people also are addicted to cutting themselves though. Shrug.\n\nThis is a piece of gaming history. A very important part of it.\n\nYou just unlocked some core memories lol. Brilliant.\n\nIt was funny as a rogue to type Anal [Rupture]\nI imagine everyclass has some funny innurendos.\n\nAnal [time warp]\n\nAnal [concussive shot]\n\nAnal [Hand of God]\n\nThat's the first one I thought of when I started reading this chain, such a good one.\n\n[deleted]\n\nI’ll never forget trying league, I played unranked with a hero I thought looked cool and immediately my teammate ripped me for picking him and quit lol\n\nI tried out league when my gaming group wanted me to play (2011, i think). They needed a tank, so I filled that role.  I decided to play the Gargoyle guy because his abilities seemed pretty cool. I looked up builds on whatever website was being used for that at the time and wrote a couple down on some paper to easily access during a game. They were upset with me for picking him over other tanks.\n\nThe first thing I was screamed at about was when I accidentally took a kill from the jungler in my bottom lane. I was told the tank is always supposed to give the kill to their teammates because they are more important. So I did my best to do exactly that. The nail in the coffin for me was towards the end of one of our games, the enemy team was making a hard push down center after they killed that boss for buffs. I began to make my way towards them to assist and when I got there, each of my teammates were below a third of their health while the enemy team was a bit above 50%. I ran up to that group and activated my ultimate. I have no clue if it's been changed now, but back then, it turned you invincible for a few seconds and forced all enemies around you to attack just you. Once the invincibility ended, it did an aoe that scaled off of the damage I would have received. My timing was impeccable because I activated it immediately after two of the enemy team activated their ultimates as well. I ended up kill 3 or 4 of them from my ult, saving all of my teammates from being wiped. We then proceeded to push mid and won a little bit later. My teams response to that upset? I stole their kills and should have stayed in the bottom lane. Yep, I was done playing after that. The toxicity was awful, and they couldn't even compliment me on doing that.\n\nHuh, that's some next level dumbassery. What server did you play on, if you're in SEA I got a group of friends that's willing to help out newbies\n\nIt was a US server, but that's all I remember. I'm not really into MOBAs and only played because they wanted me to. I appreciate the offer though!\n\nFor your first time playing your friends sound like complete assholes no offense\n\nYou're not wrong. It wasn't until years later after i stopped playing with them that I realized I was the odd man out. They played with me to fill their team but if another of their friends got on, they kicked me out.\n\nIt is just unbelievable how asinine MOBA players are. They would rather scream at you and insult you for ten minutes rather than just take ten seconds to explain what they want you to do.\n\nOn top of that, in HotS if your team runs up and has one bad engagement players will either immediately DC or BM and piss off and go AFK. Like a 2v1 trade in the first minute is gonna doom you in a 30+ kill game.\n\nIt always seemed to me that most randos have what I like to call \"main character syndrome\". Meaning they think they are the most important player/character on the team, rather than acting like they're part of a team.\n\nI just don't understand why someone would rather lose while being toxic than win while being decent. Coaching and encouraging your teammates isn't just a nice thing to do, it actively improves your chances of getting kills and winning. If someone doesn't know how to play, screaming at them is not going to improve their play, but saying \"hey, next time you see me power up, cast shield on me\" or \"stay close to the team, you're straying a bit\" or \"look out for when that enemy lights up, get out of there\" will actually make them play better and make your own game more fun!\n\nEhh there's two sides to that and both are the same problem. More often than not it just is not worth treating MOBA players like humans with brains. They are egos incarnate and even if you're playing with fresh accounts you can bet if you even suggest what your team should do they'll think more often than not \"who is this guy telling me how to play\".\n\nChat should just be disabled in all mobas.\n\nYou need better friends lol. I only play LoL with friends these days because randoms are too toxic but my friends are super chill.\n\nFirst time I played League someone just kept saying \"cycopl WHAT ARE YOU DOING???\" and I was like \"i dunno playing league of legends i guess\"\n\nI’ll never forget the numerous times my jgl tells me to stop dying when I’m being tower dived by their enemy jgl so I ask for help and he says go fuck urself and then we die again and he rages at us😂😂😂😂\n\nthe worst part about playing League of Legends is that you have to interact with League of Legends players\n\nI got called a tryhard for beating my opponents. Then when I lost to my opponents I was called trash.\n\nAnyone worse than me is a noob and needs to git gud. Anyone better than me are tryhards that have no life and needs to touch grass.\n\n— The Gamer’s Prayer.\n\nMy ex expected me to carry every game, if I picked a champ I didn't play very often and only played as well as the rest of the team she would say \"I don't want to play with you if you don't play well\" \n\nTo be fair to her the rest of our play group were inters, but we're broken up now and I've played nearly every champion on the roster 10+ games\n\nNever play summoners rift\n\nI tried to get good at Smite with some friends during covid lockdown, but I quit when someone messaged me and accused me of being a troll and throwing the game.\n\nSame but for Heroes of Newerth. Tried it out, picked a hero I liked, jumped into game. I was winning lane, thought I was doing pretty good. \n\nGot yelled at by my team for not helping defend their lanes, so I pointed out that I was winning my lane and that just made them angrier.\n\nMOBAs have a special power to turn relatively decent folks into raging assholes. The knowledge aspect of the games makes it much easier to blame people for playing badly (as opposed to a shooter where someone's unskilled execution is the main factor behind their failures) and a bad teammate can really sabotage your team as opposed to just not-contributing. Nobody likes that feeling of being stuck playing against overleveled opponents for another 20 minutes after you know you're going to lose, and it often feels like one of your own teammates actively made it happen by being lazy and stupid.\n\nNever seen that much shit-talking between teams though.\n\n&gt; Nobody likes that feeling of being stuck playing against overleveled opponents for another 20 minutes after you know you're going to lose, and it often feels like one of your own teammates actively made it happen by being lazy and stupid.\n\nBonus:\n\n&gt; \"We love the fact that if you waste more of your life on this Earth, you can make a comeback! No surrender vote.\" - Gabe Newell and Icefrog on DOTA2\n\nThe moment they added leaver penalties to custom games, DOTA2 died to me. Nobody wants to play against Golden Experience Requiem with full items for another 40 minutes cause he doesn't want to end a round of Anime Arena...\n\nMOBA's are the gold standard for toxicity. It'd have been hard to design a game to have more potential for it.\n\nI always have chat turned off when I play HotS\n\nI mean, Barrens chat wasn’t really all that toxic. It was mostly just nonsensical and full of mememing. And a fair bit of the MMO equivalent of Your Mom jokes.\n\nNowhere near the level of vitriol you see in FPS or MOBA.\n\n[deleted]\n\nAlways had fun with the inserting \"murlocs\" into movie titles in barrens chat..\n\nOne Flew Over the Murlocs Nest.\n\nAliens, but just \"Murlocs\"\n\nI do sometimes miss the endless Chuck Norris jokes in Barrens chat.\n\n[Me playing Halo or StarCraft 2 over a decade ago](https://youtu.be/MkKK49vrd6Q)\n\nMy tag was MrBlack. Big mistake.\n\nDepends on what you played, always felt like TF2 players were really laid back when I played between 2008 to 2014\n\nCoin flip,\n\nEither the most chill person you've met in a game, or the worst human being humanity has witnessed\n\nYuppp. I was an admin on a small community server back in the day, such a dichotomy of the most chill, fun people ever, and complete antisocial degenerates\n\nOlder server based games where more like Reddit. If you found a community that was chill and did not put up with anyone's bullshit, you could stick around there as much as possible and enjoy life. \n\nIf you step out of that rare server with moderation and good people, it was a gigantic mess.\n\nSnipe someone 5 times as Sniper or Ambassador Spy.\n\nHow they react is the toxicity test. Foolproof.\n\nThis is why I miss community owned servers\n\nRandoms feel almost always toxic, but when you're on a regular server, with folks who become friends, it's just so much better.\n\nI still hate classic MW2 for kick-starting that trend.\n\nYeah we’ve definitely lost something with random matchmaking. I remember some of my counter strike servers fondly.\n\nYes it was actually a community.  I joined a clan and became decent friends with a bunch of good dudes.  Just by playing in a favorite server every night\n\n\nNow anything I play I mute and pretend others are ai\n\nIt was better because dickheads actually got banned from the good servers. We had consequences that were meted out by the community.\n\nNowadays you can report someone and 99% chance nothing happens, or maybe it's a 3 day suspension or whatever, and since next game the people you're playing with are shuffled again people don't even bother reporting most of the time.\n\nCommunity CS 1.6 and Source servers around 2007-2010 were some of the most fun I ever had in a lobby game with randoms.\n\n[deleted]\n\n\"I bet you can't even afford the flood insurance for your house\"\n\n[deleted]\n\nI went back to cs1.6 last year to see what was up and I found a server with one Russian guy who wallhack headshot me then called me a\nFucking n word f word and I’m like.. wow it’s just like old times\n\nMMO's have gone to shit in that respect thanks to all the auto matchmaking and cross realm stuff.  There is no longer any incentive to be civilized, no need to worry about community reputation or anything else.\n\nAnd MMO are becoming increasingly solo focused so that feeling of community and team work has gone down the drains, before you had to make friends, guilds and overall socialization to actually do the content, nowadays you either do it solo or at max you go in the matchmaking/ looking for group function, you won’t find people in the world chat saying things like “looking for chill group for farming *********” and actually talk with people\n\nWhat a perfect summary of my issues with GTA: Online and Diablo IV atm\n\nNo real need/incentive to actually play the co-op stuff\n\nThe problem is we all grew up. I’ve got issues with modern day WoW for example, but I love the dungeon finder. I’ve got limited free time, if I had to spend it going “LFG…” over and over and then take the time to travel there and wait for everyone I probably wouldn’t play\n\nWith RuneScape I see people on the OSRS sub talk about how it started to go downfall when the GE came out, but if I had to sit in a bank typing what I want to buy or sell over and over then haggle on price, again I probably wouldn’t play\n\nI understand why MMOs are in the state they are in but it is a shame for those of us who do remember their glory days. Unfortunately I don’t foresee us ever going back\n\n&gt; “LFG…” over and over and then take the time to travel there\n\n...only for the main tank or healer to disconnect and the rest of you standing at the entrance forever\n\nI dislike when people say \"we grew up\" as if to imply there is only one generation of gamers.\n\n\nThe 30 year olds in 2006 didn't have time but the 13 year olds did. Now the 30 year olds in 2024 don't have time but the 13 year olds do. But it's *still* trending more solo. Why can't kids now do the things the 2006 kids did?\n\nThe amount of times I was called the N word playing Counter Strike as a 10 year old was insane. I was on mic too so they all knew I was a little white child.\n\nMMO’s can be just as if not more toxic if you play ranked/rated PVP.\n\nMy first memory of online gaming is my dad showing me the original Quake multiplayer, him greeting the other guy in german, and the opponent answering \"die nazi scum\" that's at least 25 years ago.\n\nLmao, my dad never showed me, I was a little too young for that at the time. But he’s told me stories about old school lan parties and the fact cod and halo lobbies were definitely not the first to invent online trash talk\n\nEven copy paste spamming a message in the game chat after killing someone was already a thing back then.\n\nOriginal Xbox live was just n word after n word. There wasn’t a lot of moderation and everyone had a headset.\n\n[This sums it up](https://i.imgur.com/CXMu09m.jpeg)\n\nShit, there are videos still up *right now* from 2005-2010 where logging into Halo 3 multiplayer was a near guarantee of nonstop homophobia/racism\n\nThe crunchy mics making it barely audible makes it vintage.\n\nAnd people circlejerk about how tough they were because they could take it and dish it out. Like bruh, no reason to be like that. Not every teen who plays acts like that; it's not normal.\n\nMy friends and I grew up during that time and they are like \"Yeah the old days were better; we were tougher back then\" and I was like \"Yall were getting so fucking heated and you fucking broke your xbox after someone called you a slur\"\n\nI will say, mmos during the 2000s was great for me. I made so many friends and experienced very wholesome moments. Also TF2 when it was brand new was such a fun experience.\n\nThis.\n\nLiterally every MW lobby was slurs and racism and implied sexual assault against everyone's mothers.\n\nUsing OW for this post was especially egregious, considering Blizzard did like zero to actually stop all of it until they got bad press for it, then they started banning all but the most kid-friendly phrases.\n\nShould've seen the things people would say in the OG StarCraft. Filters didn't exist, I don't remember any real enforced reporting system got language, all you could do was block the guy and he'd just trash talk you to other people instead. There were even racist and porn custom maps.\n\nI wanted to say Quake 3 Area too but I don't remember it being that bad. Matches were kinda quick, hard to focus on cussing out the other guys.\n\nIt wasn't assualt. Everything with your mother was consensual. \n\nWe were gonna be your new daddy. Then she realized a 16 year old COD pro isn't really husband material.\n\nBasically every online Warzone match:\n\n- \"Ok let's drop on my mark.\" No one responds. \n\n- Ten minutes of silence. \n\n- Random team member faffing about on the other side of the map from the rest: \"F\\*\\*k you, piece of s\\*\\*t. Yo where's the team? Y'all are trash, learn to play!\"\n\n- \"Rejoin the team, we're holding this high-rise.\"\n\n- \"Y'all f\\*\\*king trash. Why are my teammates always garbage!?\"\n\n- \"Dude, you got *matched* with us.\"\n\n- Disconnects.\n\nand even after that it did very little to stop the usage of slurs...\n\nIt’s funny to me seeing this comment in an Overwatch post because when Overwatch 1 was brand new everyone was praising how insanely chill and nice the community was.\n\nI have no idea when that game flipped into being known as a toxic cesspit, but in my mind it’s an example of a modern shooter that actually had wholesomeness for a while.\n\nOverwatch 2 can go fuck itself though.\n\n&gt;I have no idea when that game flipped into being known as a toxic cesspit\n\nRanked mode.\n\nThat came out a month after the game released.\n\nNah it was when they launched Overwatch League and it started picking up steam. \n\nEven at the beginning of ranked people were reasonably chill unless your team had 4 people trying to go DPS or something. Once OWL was established, the casual player base had a pro league that they could point to as the “correct” competitive meta and suddenly every ranked player became an expert in team composition and shot calling. The amount of people in Gold elo that flipped out if you tried to pick a DPS champ during GOATS meta was unbearable.\n\nThis game LITERALLY (figuratively) came out with a chat censor for gg ez to change it to funny phrases. Because all online communities are toxic.\n\nReally? That's hilarious.\n\nI imagine that people were immediately changing it to gee gee eesee or some bullshit with special characters.\n\nSometimes but usually the replaced message was funnier and you knew what it really meant so it was spammed anyways.\n\nYeah I suppose it's like \"Hello\" in Hearthstone and becomes triggering anyway.\n\nIdk. I used to purposely say it to trigger the filtered message, which therefore let the other team know you were being toxic, in turn causing them to become toxic back.\n\nThey added it in August the year it came out.  It was still toxic as fuck before then, which is why it was added.  But it didn't \"literally\" come out with it.\n\nMany games start out that way, and then slowly devolve in to mud throwing. Partially because small communities tend to support each other, partly because the waters have yet to be tested for the people that like being edgy. \n\nI like tactical shooters, and it's a common thing for small tight knit communities to slowly dissolve as those games gain more mainstream attention, and this in turn means less moderation and more toxicity. \n\nIt's simply the way of things. Many people will say anything that comes to mind, when there's no repercussions.\n\n&gt; I have no idea when that game flipped into being known as a toxic cesspit\n\nright about time the overwatch league made people think their no skill ass could have an easy career and quick attention\n\nFor real. I got called every name under the sun by Widowmakers for aimbotting them on launch. I was a Mercy man who knew the gun has no spread and 5 headshots was enough to kill a widowmaker that's standing still. \n\nIt wasn't as systematic as it is now\n\nSure, games are not chatrooms and that's not their purpose; But you used to be able to make a lot of friends in multiplayer-games. Now it's quite rare\n\nthere's always been a mix between the two.\n\nLiterally, the pictures are one game apart.\n\nOne’s a win and the other’s a loss\n\nThe trick is to play long enough and tilt so hard that the wins just leave you feeling like \"ok good, fuck, finally yes\" and the losses make you want to bite your desk.\n\nYou’ve just described the algorithm behind the matchmaking\n\nI played since OW beta and it was toxic as hell since the word go. My friend always wanted me to play competitive, not because I was super skilled, but because I was somewhat effective at reducing toxicity in the match and keeping morale high. \n\nOW has always been an extremely toxic game. I had one group throw the game while just repeating that they are glad my dad died. I certainly couldn’t remove toxicity from the match. \n\nThere are also amazing games where everyone gets along and is positive on both teams.\n\nThat story is fucking insane lol, and I wouldn’t believe if u I wasn’t an FPS gamer myself\n\nTop image is about video gaming before the Battle of Agincourt.\n\nWar. War never gg no re.\n\nOnline Multiplayer's never really been NOT toxic.\n\nOne of my first experiences in online gaming was slapping on my headset and playing SOCOM US Navy Seals on the Playstation 2. I remember a guy twice my age called me a \"butterscotch bitch\" because I didn't know how to play.\n\nim sorry but that insult has me rolling\n\nIt was devastating to me when I was like... 10? Now I find it hilarious.\n\noh good we can laugh together\n\nButter bar/bars was a negative term for players in socom ranked low or just new. They often got made fun of for it by the higher ranks, cookie and wings. That was probably what he was referring to.\n\nIm dead lmao. Gonna have to steal this one man\n\nThat is a hilarious insult, and I picture it with a British accent. Makes it funnier.\n\nAlmost as good as my friend Andrew calling me a baby back bitch when I left him to die in LoL back in 2012.\n\nI played hundreds of CSGO matches and I still vividly remember the one match where everyone was absolutely lovely. We were all pleasant to each other, offered encouragement and advice, and pulled a 5 round comeback to win. At the end one of the guys just said \"this was the most fun match I've ever had.\"\n\nIt's so much easier to be nice than toxic.\n\nThen you queue into the next game, and you have a team of silver 1 stuck racists that don't understand economy and call you slurs every time you die. Sometimes I get whiplash from how different back to back lobbies can be\n\nexactly, people have always been super competitive and toxic even before multiplayer gaming was a thing\n\nLet's not forget 12 year olds going on racist rants and talking about your mom on Xbox.\n\nEven before voice coms, there was teabagging and adding you after the game to send you toxic racist messages.\n\noriginally it wasn't, as far as I remember at least in the mid/late 90s very early 2000s, quakeworld ctf, unreal tournament, q3 arena, were competitive but nowhere near as toxic as things are nowadays. Probably due to the fact that all servers were hosted by the community and if you were banned it had way more downsides, so people behaved a lot more. Not having voice also helped of course keeping things cooler, but even text chat was way more polite than it is now.\n\nZoomer take. Why do you think the infamous CoD lobbies are talked about?\n\nAlso pregames in Halo.\n\nGetting called a f*g 4 times and having your mom’s chastity questioned all within the span of 10 seconds was a nightly occurrence.\n\nCounter-Strike voice and sprays. Hell, I remember Doom and Quake death matches being *full* of cunts.\n\nIt ain't new, and OP is either extremely naive or one of the most toxic people there and unable to recognise himself.\n\nLmfao are you deluding yourself into thinking that online gaming was ever a pillar of congeniality or just trolling? Because this is weak bait mate\n\nWho could possibly have any rose colored glasses about the toxicity level of online gaming? Its been a cesspit since the dawn of the internet.\n\nI liked when voice chat came about and I started to realize that all these guys who alleged to have fucked my mom last night hadn't even gone  through puberty.\n\nRight? Here people talking like it was better during OW1 while I distinctly remember all the \"gg ez u suk lol kekekekeke\" from playing Starcraft online last millennium.\n\nOverwatch has always been extremely toxic\n\nGames in general have always been toxic. Didn't overwatch come out in like 2018 or some shit? Cod was famous for being toxic like 13 years before that.\n\n2016 but before that pubG was main toxic game\n\nbefore the LoL was the main toxic game\n\nbefore the CoD was the main toxic game\n\nbefore that halo was the main toxic game (still is given how self destructive the community is)\n\nbefore that I would say the first release of counter strike, so nasty condition zero was dead before it even released\n\nand before that it's a toss up of unreal and quake\n\nThey were all toxic and still toxic. It's just one gets more media attention for being popular at the time.\n\nI would like ow1 back. 6v6 was more fun imo.\n\nThe lack of an off-tank took so much away from the game.. I really hope they go back to 6v6 one day\n\nApparently they are considering it and testing it. The reasons for OW2's existence eare dwindling by the day\n\nThe only reason it exists was to switch to f2p and charge €40 for skin bundles. They admitted ages ago that they knew for years PvE would never be what they promised.\n\nIt was so tragic too because the characters were designed such that they would hint at plot points that would have been so much fun in a campaign or a proper mission setting, maybe it was lack of resources but I do know the team has been in a state of chaos over the past few years\n\nWhy they couldn't do it doesn't really matter to me. Only that they knew they couldn't do it before launching ow2 but they did it anyway.\n\nIt's a damn shame. Overwatch 1 was one of the best multiplayer shooters ever made, and they somehow found a way to fuck it up. The Blizzard we knew and loved is dead and gone\n\nI'm still sort of in shock from ow2. I BOUGHT ow1. And now it's just gone. A perfectly good game just gets deleted because the sequel sort of released.\n\nI'm positive they'll try to rerelease it someday.\n\nYeah it's crazy that a game we bought disappeared\n\nAs soon as we moved from physical copies to digital, we stopped buying games and bought licenses to play instead. It's a nasty sleight of hand that none of us noticed until it was far too late\n\n&gt; As soon as we moved from physical copies to digital\n\nTell that to everyone with physical copies of Overwatch 1\n\nOW1 was amazing, I was completely in on it. I loved the story, the characters, the gameplay. Even competitive play was super fun with seemingly more helpful/positive teammates than negative. Then OW2 came and I stopped playing completely\n\nFor that exact reason I will never play OW2 and probably not another blizzard game ever again. I used to be a hard core blizzard nerd, but my god they have become one of the worst companies in the industry.\n\nThey said they're making trials to bring back 6v6, at least at some extent and if enough players provide positive feedback about it, so you have something to look forward to!\n\nthis makes me feel dirty but... I miss loot boxes.  I refuse to engage with whatever cluster fuck they've got going on for skins now (seriously; I used free coins to pay for a pass and the event skins I wanted were not even in the paid for battlepass ffs... those were 90$ each instead).\n\nWhat used to be excitement for a new event, trying to earn coins and unlock some skins via RNG, has turned to annoyance and apathy.  Their \"omg look at the skins in this event\" promotions hit more like taunting \"look what you cant have\" instead of something to celebrate and have fun with.\n\nThe only reason I still play is nobody else is even trying to do a team shooter that isnt just another \"pistol, riffle, shotgun, sniper\" game.....\n\nThe reason you miss them is because overwatch lootboxes were barely lootboxes. It was just a method of handing out free cosmetics. It's not like they gave you the box and then said \"great, now fork over £1.69 for the key to it\" (hello valve). You got it and then you opened it, and sometimes there was a cool skin in there, or there were credits you could use to buy a cool skin.\n\nIf those same boxes were added back to Overwatch 2, new players would lose their minds over how generous they are.\n\nit's almost like having the entire five person team's enjoyment depend on how well your single tank plays is a breeding ground for toxicity.\n\nI think everyone here forgot that most OW1 games ended with an \"mtd\" in chat, nothing new lol\n\nWhy they need 6v6 back. They ruined a good thing. Half the matches are going to be a random crap shoot because a single role can define the success of an entire match regardless of the other players skills.\n\n&gt; Why they need 6v6 back.\n\nThat wouldn't change anything tbh. People screamed main tank diff all the time when the game was 6v6.\n\nIdk wtf the person on the bottom said \n\nThere are no tanks on the enemy team. No difficulty. Easy win essentially. Basic overwatch toxicity at its finest\n\ndiff means difference. “dps diff” for example means the team won because of the ability gap between the damage dealers\n\nShoot. My bad. Cheers for the correction\n\nIs it even toxic if it isn't a 12 year old saying they fucked your mom while teabagging? I'm unimpressed \n\nSee, back then, toxicity was very general and widely applicable, teenagers now will explain to you exactly what your shortcomings in the game are. \"Is your mouse even plugged in?\" will always hit 1000x harder than \"i fucked your mom\"\n\nThat would honestly get a chuckle and a compliment out of me.   Ive been playing so long that the racial slurs and cussing comes across as extremely boring and dumb.  Especially because most of these people are morons and just repeat the same insult over and over. \n\nSo a detailed well thought out and delivered insult always gets me laughing.  That’s called good banter in my book.  Always welcome.\n\n&gt; \"Is your mouse even plugged in?\" will always hit 1000x harder than \"i fucked your mom\"\n\nNot if you say it right after walking into their room.\n\nGood game easy, as in easy win for us. No tank meaning you had no tank and thus no chance. When people say diff they are taking about the skill difference, usually they will say tank diff or something, as in we won because out tank was better. Saying team diff is just straight shit talk saying our whole team was better than your whole team.\n\nGg ezzz no tank team diff\n\nHope that helps\n\nGettin' a bit tired of this low-effort meme stuff.\n\nTime to leave the internet forever then. Later, GG.\n\nMy memes are so low effort they don't exist\n\nI have concepts of memes\n\n“No heals”\n-10K heals 🧐🙄\n\nCongrats on finally getting new glasses! For your next set, maybe use clear lenses instead of of rose tinted ones. \n\n\nOnline gaming has been like this for *at least* the last 20 years. If anything it's better because people have found it easier to just bitch about the game instead of taking a shot in the dark at which racial slur will actually apply to you. \n\n\nSource: white guy in his 30's who was called the N word in Halo 2 a shocking amount.\n\nIs this implying people were nice in s1 ow lol?\n\nI hate this about online gaming. People being so nasty for no reason because there isn't the immediate consequence for getting punched in the face.\n\nLike dogs barking behind a fence.\n\nfirst one was never real\n\nYeah who typed that out in chat? No one.\n\nAs soon as the game was open to buy, it went toxic. Played one match and was like nope. Work full-time job, don't need this.\n\nGG ez has been around since StarCraft. 1. Without brood war.\n\nNo, it was never like that lol...\n\nAbsolutely nothing has changed. Gg ez is still the mating call of the micropenis gang.\n\nI've been online gaming since it was implemented and it's always had toxic assholes.\n\n  \nHell, it predates this but there was a reason stuff like [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM2Jxc4zI90&amp;) was created.\n\nDelusional honestly, overwatch in particular has been a gutter since release. Just how shooters work\n\nOne of the reasons I just don’t play many pvp games anymore, I understand it’s a competition but it should still be fun.\n\nMiss Overwatch launch day when most people were just fucking around and doing stupid team comps for fun and no one got furious because of who you were playing.\n\nHalo 2\n\nRacist, antisemitic, homophobic, misogynistic, continual talk of sexual violence… and I never got banned\n\nAll I can hear is the Wonder Years theme in my head now imagining these fond memories of old\n\n*what would you do, if I sang out of tune*\n\nAh, yes, nostalgia for an imaginary past.\n\nas the \\_actual\\_ economy gets worse, people act shitter. this is a historic fact.\n\nLong gone are the simple days of telling someone you’re going to fuck their mom, where did the time go?\n\nold days of csgo were so fucking toxic but fun at half time especially. I miss those half time bouts\n\nMan, playing NFL 2k on the Dreamcast was toxic as fuck. If anything, things have improved with the tools we have now to report people.\n\nI think the bigger issue is that everything is overrun with kids now \n\nEvery once and a while I’m like “maybe if I put my headset on, I’ll have some game chat fun like the good ol days”\n\nThen the average age of players is like 8 years old and I turn the game off\n\nDAMN, I remember OW on release...(first and last game I will ever pre-order, for various reasons, one of them being the FULL GAME being released at the exact time they said it would be released, albeit with a 30 minute delay when the servers crashed when everyone tried to log in exactly at 3PM)...you would get a good team and people (myself included) would beg people to stay in lobby and queue up together...\n\n\nIt was like the CS community and the LoL/Dota community had this sort of symbiotic, newfound respect for the online gaming space for a brief, brief moment.\n\n\nAnd it was wonderful."

    "all_comment_text": "I forget about him but always find myself bummed out when I see some sort of anniversary post for his passing. I'm glad he's in the credits, though. It's such a shame he isn't here to enjoy it.\n\nSometimes I'll be looking through my sub list on YouTube and there he is. It'll always be there, it doesn't feel right to unsub even though his videos are fairly irrelevant now (being \"topical\" and many of these games being updated) and  I know there'll never be another upload.\n\nHis \"Arbitrary Game Awards\" were my favorite. It's what introduced me to Transistor 😭\n\na few years after he passed I thought to myself \"why do I feel like I am aware of so few games coming out these days?\" and part of the answer is simply that totalbiscuit is gone\n\n\nI do like that league of legends keeps \"[Total Biscuits](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Total_Biscuit_of_Everlasting_Will)\" in his memory even if the name has slightly changed (he was an early supporting voice for lol and my understanding is that people who got enough people to sign up with their referral code got various perks)\n\nWarframe too. They were live doing a stream when it was annohnced he past and the hosts broke down crying and ended stream. He was a huge supporter and most early people heard of the game from him\n\niirc they feel that without his early support Warframe would have died years ago\n\nHis first video he completely demolished the game because at the time they had no idea how to make a live service. So they took notes from the video and worked on everything he criticized them for.\n\nSpeaking for myself, he's the one who got me into the over 600 hours I spent playing warframe. And I'm sure many are like me.\n\nI watched that moment. The presenter really had a hard time keeping it together while signing off the stream.\n\nSo few people in the history of the universe have ever had such a positive and profound influence on others. It's a shame that you don't always see the full impact of that while someone is alive, but it's undeniable now. He helped shape an entire art form, and many of the things we love about gaming today wouldn't have happened without his influence.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/MYT2K_0oSYw\n\nThe worst part is that the \"Total Biscuits\" were a bullshit reward Riot gave TB. If I remember correctly there were several tiers of rewards depending on the number of referrals and the top one was you get to design a champion with Riot if you had like 100k referrals or something like that. TB was massive at the time and was a very early supporter so he easily cleared the top tier of referrals and Riot backpedaled on the reward, which soured TB to covering league from that point on.\n\nWhich is really dumb since their champ design at the time really had no rules or limitations. It would have been impossible to fuck up.\n\nThey did the same thing to Tim Buckley of all people (Ctrl + Alt + Delete webcomic guy) with his Cthuluphant design, and Heroes of Newerth (a now dated competitor) said '[hey we'll make it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTXz3eDYedE)'. \n\nAs you can probably tell by the dislike ratio (1.6k to 2.7k for those who don't have the addon) it was not well recieved initially, but I thought he was neat.\n\nMan, I fucking LOVED both Heroes of Newerth and CAD when I was younger. I had no idea that was his design. I loved MsPudding's hero spotlights too, this takes me back, haha. There's still a fan group keeping the game going in private servers and last time I checked it doesn't take too long to find a game. :)\n\nIronically that event led to him abandoning League and going hard on Dota. He really didn't like Riot changing the deal after the winners were decided.\n\nmore ironically is that the biscuits have become a staple across the seasons where other peoples rewards haven't.\n\n\nStill think a nice top hat would be more fun than deathcap\n\nAlso TB always struck me as a fairly reasonable guy. He had some misses in his career, but everyone has those.\n\nI think he would've just given Riot a general thematic idea for the hero and then maybe given feedback on the implementation. They could've turned it into a Youtube documentary (those didn't really exist back then though) on how designing a hero works at Riot, and TB would've been the perfect point of view for viewers. Knowledgeable on games, but definitely not in tune with game design for LoL.\n\nCould've been a great thing.\n\nCorrect, the other that had (a since removed) item was athene...\n\nI miss the co-optional podcast\n\n\"recently\" Jesse and Dodger started a podcast called Geekenders. While not the same without TB it's really nice and got similar vibes.\n\nLoved the episode in which Dodger just talks to the guest about turtles for an hour. \n\nReally reminded me of the old slogan \"We *occasionally* talk about video games\"\n\nIs Sips so unknown on reddit now that he's just \"the guest\"?\n\nI haven't watched any gaming podcasts since Co-Optional, soooooooo\n\nMy favourite is still his lets play series of Terraria with Jesse Cox. He still sounded so lively and happy back then. Before he had to start dealing with cancer. But yes his arbitrary game awards were awesome as well. And lets not forget his snarkatons of the game awards.\n\nHis \"WTF is...\" (iirc??) of Bastion led me to becoming a SuperGiant Games fan for life. I would've otherwise never heard of them until Hades and that would be a shame, because their entire catalogue is fantastic\n\nMe too man me too. And I still sub to a lot of his old circle (people like Jesse and Crendor and Dodger the yogscast etc) and he will get brought up once in a while. I can tell it’s getting easier for them but it was rough for a long time, especially for Jesse cox\n\nJesse Cox finally hit a million subs. He also started a new podcast with Dodger, which seems to be doing well.\n\nYes! It popped in my YouTube feed randomly yesterday and I cannot explain how happy it made me. I used to tune into Co-Optional now and then, even though I barely play on PC, but it led me towards fun small indie games.\n\nI know how I'll be spending my weekend!\n\nImagine if TB could be a part of the Scary Game Squad. I need his snark back in my life.\n\nOh lord you just triggered a desire I never knew I had.\n\nI can’t remember how TB did with horror, but the smack talk when everyone else got scared would be wonderful.\n\nAbout a week ago, YouTube randomly recommended me his \"WTF Is... -Guise of the Wolf ?\" Video, so I watched it again for old times' sake.\n\nMan. I remember that whole debacle as it happened. Utterly insane devs, same with Day One: Garry's Incident.\n\nHis response video to the Day One: Gary's Incident takedown was what introduced me to Total Biscuit\n\nhelps to have a map\n\nthe first thing to go through my head any time I've seen a map in any context for the past decade\n\nWe’re here to ask and answer one simple question: How has TB stuck with us so hard all these years? RiP\n\nOne of the last unbiased and great gaming journalists. I can’t think of anyone who could replace him.\n\nI used to watch him, The Jimquisition and Zero Punctuation. TB always felt like he was the most relatable and genuine. Sterling had always been critical of the industry, but now it's mostly griping and moaning. Yahtzee was always fun, The Escapist is probably gonna die afer the team quit.\n\nFor anyone unaware, the folks that quit the Escapist formed Second Wind. Zero Punctuation is trademarked, so rebranded to Fully Ramblomatic, and lots of other great stuff too. Cold Take is so good. The folks spearheading the move were extremely open and ethical about it and the support was so fantastic to see.\n\nCold Take guy, Frost, left after disagreeing with how Second Wind was being run\n\nI sometimes find a game on sale that he did a WTF on and it's a delight to watch the 40 min.\n\nI feel that,  how I used to feel about eddsworld.\n\nEvery time I see an FOV slider I gotta pour one out for my boy.\n\nMy man did not back down from advocating for the players and I'll always appreciate those efforts.\n\nIts literally the first thing I look for in every options menu when I start up a game. He might be gone now for over six years now, but dammit if he didn't ingrain that love of FOV and unlocked FPS into me.\n\nIsn’t he the LuL emote on twitch? I never was really aware of him till his passing and just heard that TotalBiscuit had passed.\n\nYep that is him.\n\nGenuinely still makes me sad that he's gone. He would love the relative golden age of warhammer games we currently have.\n\nEvery time there's a new controversy or new predatory business trend I think about how it might have been different if we still had him around. There aren't a whole lot of universally respected voices out there advocating so strongly for the consumer, and TB was one of the loudest and most effective.\n\nI wonder sometimes how different the market might be if we hadn't lost him and his ability to point at something stupid and shame it in a way that even AAA studios couldn't ignore.\n\noh, god. Blood Bowl 3 would have been roasted so hard.\n\nI don't know, I feel like the market basically trampled over us. The internet is larger and the voices of the internet are not as united as they were, getting a big publisher to change course on anti-consumer practices feels harder every day.\n\n\nWhen I played Elden Ring for the first time I imagine him loving it. Same with BG3\n\nHe would not shut up about BG3 I can imagine. But also Armoured Core 6? Giant mechs with good controls?\n\nEvery now and then I’ll scroll through Steam and see a comment from his Curator group. Never forget. 🥹\n\nhis [space marine review](https://youtu.be/nb50aAFiOpM?si=Ee0-IomEShB_EFb7) brought an amazing game to my attention that otherwise would have passed me by. I'm hype for the sequel directly thanks to him.\n\nI'll never get tired of listening to TB gush about a good options menu.\n\nThe man was responsible for half my steam library. When he said a game is good, then it usually was.\n\nI still have him as a curator on steam so sometimes I randomly be looking at a steam page and see his pfp and get sad.\n\nI'll never forgive those losers that tried to drag his name through the mud after he passed away.\n\nI forgot them as quickly as possible, fuck those dicks. TB is a legend\n\nWhat?  Who?\n\nSorry I don't know his story, can someone give me the rundown? I'm new to warhammer so I assume he was big in the community?\n\nHe held the starcraft 2 competitive scene up alone with his erect penis.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/0oBfIye.png\n\nThis thread brought a smile to my face, this comment and link brought something else entirely.\n\nI still remember early SC2 tournaments when we had to wait HOURS for the matches to start because Battlenet was acting up once again.  \n  \nIn their infinite wisdom of powerthirst Blizzard refused to add LAN Support.\n\nMan, I remember when he basically revived SlayerS after the debacle that ended that team. Axiom was a fun squad\n\nDude was big in the GAMING community. He was the biggest advocate for the consumer in gaming and can be attributed as the reason for a lot of good things in games. \n\nHe is immortalised all over the internet/in games in one way or the other. On twitch there are one or more emojis made after him and in League of legends theres an item after him (even though thats a longer story). \n\nHe spearheaded FOV sliders in gaming. It was a big point of his videos and it became a sort of meme. \n\nHe was also one of the first to really shine a light onto the indie dev scene aswell if i am not mistaken. \n\nDudes a legend, Rest in peace TB.\n\nAdding, he was a big proponent behind YouTube gamers, helped and supported YogsCast from their early days, was heavily involved with Polaris / The Game Station and ensuring YouTubers got paid - was just an overall legend\n\nif you ever enjoyed Co-Optional in the past, Jesse and Dodger do a once-a-week podcast that is very much in line with the spirit of that show called Geekenders that comes out every Friday. It's hilarious and everyone should watch it.\n\n&gt; helped and supported YogsCast from their early days\n\nRight up until they stabbed him in the back because he suggested they should tell people when they are doing a paid advertisement or sponsored video instead of pretending its their honest opinions.\n\nYoutube was the wild west back then and people did a whole bunch of shit that was blatantly illegal but hadn't yet caught the attention of regulatory bodies. TB pushed for more transparency around that kind of stuff and actually broke the news on several shady advertising initiatives where youtubers were being paid to explicitly give only positive coverage. The Yogscast were against that and were instead angling for stuff like revenue sharing with games companies where they would provide positive coverage, disguised as a genuine review or first impressions video, in exchange for a cut of the profits from game sales.\n\nTheir own fanbase raked them over the coals for it when one of them (Lewis) pulled the \"Well its not TECHNICALLY illegal, my very real lawyer totally said so\" defense on their subreddit and tried to pretend like TB was guilty of doing the same thing but couldn't provide even a single example. For years it was the most downvoted comment on their sub, if I recall correctly.\n\nSimon literally waited until TB was in the hospital and couldn't respond to start blasting him all over twitter.\n\nTB was the one at TheGameStation who suggested they get the Yogscast on board. Before that they were basically an obscure WoW related channel. 5 Months after joining TheGameStation they started their Shadow of Israphel series, which is what made them popular. Without TB there is a good argument to be made they'd never have gotten noticed and become famous at all. Despite that, the very moment he suggested they have even a shred of concern towards their audience they went full scorched earth on the friendship.\n\nHe had a fucking law degree, dude was smart, principled and pissed off a bunch of alt-right fucks during the gamer gate years. RIP John\n\nIirc he was adamant about having been to law school but not having a degree.\n\ntheres so many other epic eras of TB and his involvement in gaming.\n\nduring the Hearthstone closed beta, everyone was so hyped for it to come out, but had to wait. he was in the beta and made a lot of great content for it. he wasnt a top tier player, but he explained the cards and mechanics as he went (which a lot of other youtubers didnt), so his audience got to learn how the game works and be familiar with it when it finally launched. it made it so much more fun.\n\nhe did some cool events for planetside 2 when it was briefly popular around its launch.\n\nhe did casting for starcraft 2, and in many ways taught the community how to do esports commentary. he was just SO fucking good at it. he also sponsored a competitive team from Korea, i think. i didnt follow that close, but they were real contendors who would never got a shot otherwise.\n\nhe would take no shit from devs exploiting consumers. if any devs tried to pull fake DMCA shit on anyone, he would expose them. \n\nso many good honest and helpful reviews. every year during the steam sale, he'd assess what the top picks were based on game quality and discount....and this wasnt just like...random youtuber opinion shit...it was as objective as you could get and was a very reliable buying guide. \n\n\"Secret Hitler\" was great. (it was a social deduction board game) this kicked off the spree of games like Among Us.\n\nthe co-optional podcast was great. \n\nblood bowl tournaments were great\n\nterraria lets plays were great.\n\nvarious series of videos, like 'WTF is [game]', all great\n\nwhen i say great, i mean fucking epic.\n\nhe wasnt just a cornerstone of the Youtube gaming community, he was all four fucking corners.\n\nhe was also a loathing, cynical bastard and a complete asshole. but you know...like...*our* asshole.\n\n\"wtf is...\" was absolutely amazing because it was exactly as it was advertised. A first look at a game. No prep or anything before. It brought so so so many good changes to gaming in general.\n\ni also loved that 'wtf is' was a mix of things with niche popularity, but had some kind of buzz...like enough youd have heard of it, but still not know wtf it is...and then also truly obscure shit he just pulled out of his ass. like the weird stuff like 'Papers, Please', that most people wouldnt take a second look at, but he show you...no, no...this may have all the tech of a 90s DOS game...but theres a real game here.\n\nI've been reading a lot of comments, and this is the one to get me to actually tear up. I do miss that guy.\n\nAside from what others have said, look up his \"WTF is ... - Warhammer 40k: Space Marine?\" video to listen to him gush about the original for about 30 minutes straight.  Given how notoriously critical he could be, that was very high praise and probably helped a lot with the original game's success.\n\nWas that video that got me to buy the game.\n\nThat's probably the reason why he's in the credits of the 2nd game. Given that the original game had mixed reviews in the 7/10 region, seeing a review with as big an audience as TB had gush over their game probably made them very happy at the time. I can totally see them still being thankful for that.\n\nIf there is a FOV slider in a game you can thank TotalBiscuit for it. He was a great journalist, consumer rights activist, reviewer, podcaster and gamer. He was loved and the LUL emote on Twitch is him. Miss his co-optional podcast streams and WTF videos.\n\n&gt; Miss his co-optional podcast streams \n\nJesse and Dodger recently started a podcast together btw ([Geekenders](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFx-KViPXIkG73HSYKoj1bnQIoOfHiXDB)).\n\nWell they just got another sub...\n\nI still miss Co-Optional\n\nAlthough it's not quite the same, Jesse and Dodger has recently started a new podcast called The Geekenders. You should check it out.\n\nThey did one recently where ~~John Strife~~ Josh Strife Hayes joined them, so it was Jesse, Dodger, and a deep voiced British man with strong opinions on things sitting around talking for an hour or so. The Nostalgia was real.\n\nHis NAME is John Strife HAYES!!!\n\nDodger's husband Sam (aka Strippin) also does some voice acting in Space Marine 2.\n\n[deleted]\n\nThe episode after he passed was one of the most harrowing and difficult pieces of media I’ve ever listened to. It was so utterly raw and heartbroken and you could tell the will to continue the podcast was gone in that moment, even though it limped along for a little bit longer. There’s such a strong feeling through that episode that they really wanted it to be the last one, though they knew that’s not what TB would have wanted.\n\nI remember myself not being able to fully accept that he was gone because a few days before he passed, he was talking about pivoting his YT/Twitch channels once he was well enough to record again. It just felt surreal. It didn't click with me until that episode, when Genna mentioned that his ashes are in his SC2 team's GSTL championship trophy.\n\nIt was also touching that Genna mentioned that in TB's final hours, he was talking in his sleep and reviewing a game (Smite, maybe? I think it was a MOBA). I forget what it was, but he was doing what he loved right up to the end.\n\nIt's not 100% the same without TB, but Dodger and Jesse have been doing a weekly podcast for the last 6 months or so called Geekenders. It's format is pretty similar, and mostly just dissolves into them talking about whatever game or movie they're playing now, or whatever the big news is. Plus they have roaring weekly guests, both new and returning from Coop (not to mention the occasional \"we couldn't find anybody so Crendor is here again\" episodes)\n\nThe intro jingle lives rent free in my head\n\n🎶Cooooooo-optional tune in we're talkin to you🎶\n\nI'll never forget when he talked about playing Battlefleet Gothic and how everything about 40k is the most metal.\n\nHe always felt older and mature, but he was only 32 when he died. It's crazy to think he wasn't much older than me\n\nEdit: he was 33\n\n33 actually, nearly 34.\n\nAnd now I'm realizing I'm now older than TB. Feels bad man.\n\nSame dude. When he died I knew it was too young but 33 felt so far away for me at the time. Now I’m 35. \n\nI still catch myself thinking randomly while playing a game or watching a trailer “what would TB say about this game?” \n\nI bet he would have fucking loved Helldivers 2.\n\nI always thought about how he would have liked DOOM Eternal after his videos on Doom 2016.\n\nthere almost an annoyance with this \n\nlike you start to realise just how much good he was doing and  how much more he could of done   \n\nwe all lost something special when he died   and we will never know the full potential he could of reached\n\nHe took his job seriously so he was in turn taken seriously.\n\nI worked with him back before he became big on a small web radio for the original PlanetSide, called PSR. He was TotalHalibut back then, and was our most popular DJ and host, pulling in a whopping 2-dozen listeners at one point. 😅\n\nThat would've been when he was about 19; we were about the same age (I was 20 then) and I remember talking with him about how he was a DJ on his college radio station at the time.\n\nWe lost touch when he moved on to WoW, but it was exciting to see him rise to fame, though not terribly unsurprising. He was a good guy, a great personality, and a talented man. \n\nRIP, TB. 33 is too fucking young.\n\nTotalBiscuit taught us to never preorder. RIP, you glorious bastard. o7\n\nAlso to demand better of our PC ports. Like an FOV slider is a must.\n\nHe would have been proud to see the ports Nixxes has done\n\n&gt; Like an FOV slider is a must.\n\nWhich this game paying homage to him doesn't have.\n\nAnd here we are with people paying 100 bucks to play this game 4 days early lol\n\nNo one was an advocates for good PC gaming practices as TB did. And I don’t think anyone will ever come close, here’s to the best British ever made.\n\n\"We do not pre-order\" - House Biscuit.\n\nRIP. Many hours listening to this man try to get the gaming industry to be better.\n\nThe Bore Z video he did is still one of the greatest one. Magnificent bastard he was.\n\nThis game better have an FOV slider\n\nSpoiler: it does not\n\nThird Person Games as a whole tend to not have FoV sliders.\n\nIronically, it doesn't. Still seems like a decent PC version though from what I've experienced and read of other people's performance.\n\nWait till you hear about the number of preorders.\n\nSaying everything TB stood for is what the gaming community and industry have gone completely against hand in hand over the years would be an understatement.\n\nWe'll never quite know WTF is; 40k, Space marine 2\n\nThis hurt more than I expected.  Gods I miss that man.\n\nWTF is... Darktide and Vermintide 2 too\n\nFor the people who may not know, he was a YouTube content creator in the early 2010s when PC was disregarded by most developers, TB championed ports to PC and bringing PC features like changing FoV and other improvements for users. He also gave a platform for many indie studios that were starting out like Supergiant Games (Hades). He was also a BIG W40K fan and when the original Space Marine came out he gave it glowing praise, there weren't that many great 40k games at the time. He sadly passed away from cancer in 2018.\n\nTB was the one who got me into watching YouTube content in general, period. His content is what originally convinced me that the platform had a lot more going for it than just silly cat videos.\n\nHis Terraria series with Jessie, Game Theory, and the Game Grumps were it for me. I realized I was enjoying it more than the crap I was watching on cable, and I've basically never looked back. Thanks TB\n\nTerraria with him and Jesse was one of the first Youtube series I remember watching. They were just so funny. I should go back and watch sometime.\n\nI'm surprised no one's linked his [legendary first impressions video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nb50aAFiOpM) yet, in which he's literally squealing with childlike glee at the feeling of turning squads of orks into red mist within the first ten minutes of gameplay. For a guy who called himself \"The Cynical Brit,\" this was so out of character for him that it became one of the most popular reviews on his channel, and probably directly sold a ton of people on the first game. Of all the games people wish he could still be around to see him play, I'm sure this one is very near the top of the list, but this is a nice homage to his contribution to the first game's success.\n\nAs soon as he fired the bolter he knew it was gonna be a fun game. Good times.\n\nGod, the intro to that video just hit me in the face like a brick of solid nostalgia.\n\nHe was also a big Starcraft 2 personality, some of his earliest videos helped propel early Starcraft 2 to its height in popularity.\n\nI distinctly recall TB saying that he would keep the SC2 scene alive, even if he had to prop it up with nothing but his erect penis.\n\nHe was hosting SC2 tournaments and paying the prize pools till the bloody end \\m/,\n\nI have no idea if this is true but I laughed out loud and this made my day better\n\nIt is true. I remember when it happened years ago. The original comment might still be somewhere on r/starcraft\n\nI still remember Trump(the Hearthstone player) straight up breaking down during his stream when he heard the news.\n\nGone too soon.\n\nSame with the Warframe devs during their livestream, it was just heartbreaking. And TB was the reason I discovered Warframe.\n\nGenuinely his video on the game when it was in its infancy is possibly the single biggest influence one person has ever had on the success of a video game, he helped put them in the limelight which helped their player base grow when they needed it most and now it’s still very much going strong. Reb and Megan’s emotions were beyond justified on that day.\n\nTB was why many folk discovered Warframe. They basically owed their early success to him.\n\nAnd NOT because he praised them - because he CRITICISED them, and they took it to heart.\n\nHe was the reason Warframe even lived. He brought a stupid amount of people to the game.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/MYT2K_0oSYw\n\nThis one\n\nHe was very pivotal to Warframe's success, to the point where Digital Extremes adored him. He passed away on the same day as a weekly prime time stream hosted by Rebecca and Megan, and seeing them trying to stay composed long enough at the start of the stream to announce that they were cancelling it for the week is burned into my memory. The entire community held silent vigils in-game for him too.\n\nFuck cancer, love TB. He entertained the hell out of me for years and made me laugh my ass off. Loved his wtf is series too. Was always a good day when you saw a new TB vid post.\n\nI hear you and agree, but also I chuckled at the phrase \"Fuck cancer, love TB\" given how TB is often used to refer to Tuberculosis :)\n\nTBs review of Space Marine made me buy the first one and got me into the universe. I miss watching him on the podcast with Jesse and Dodger.\n\nFor some reason YouTube's been giving me a lot of old Jesse and Dodger clips lately, and it's surreal seeing TB pop up in some of them. Wild how time just marches steadily on.  It's sad that he's gone, but nice to know Jesse and Dodger are still at it.\n\nTheir weekenders podcast is hilarious. I was watching some of Jesse's FFXIV stuff so I think that's how I got into the Jesse algorithm again. Their friendship is really cute and I love how wholesome their podcast is. They keep it fun and don't get into all toxic stuff.\n\nwow that’s insane. i feel him being there in the credits is not a light thing. it’s actually a fuck ton of work to get credits down and most certainly requires sign off on all those other top names that someone else is above them. \n\nthen they all agreed TB be at the top. I guess he has a lot more impact than i ever thought. That to me almost implicates the game couldn’t be done without him. \n\ncould be some throwaway thing but again credits are not trivial to put together. So a lot of people had to say sure put some random english guy that maybe not even most of the studio even know. \n\nvery interesting\n\nOh dude. Go and watch his video on the original Space Marine. He spends the whole duration of the video gushing over his love for 40k, how awesome space marines are and how well the game captures it. \n\nAt one point he mentions that while Space Marine has some traits of a cover shooter, it's not one. Because space marines don't take cover. No, SPACE MARINES ARE YOUR COVER!\n\n&gt;maybe not even most of the studio even know\n\nThere likely isn’t a game developer alive today who hasn’t heard of TB especially if they’re doing a Warhammer game.\n\nI listened to him on WoW Radio from 2006 til whenever I quit World of Warcraft 3 years later. Some of those WoW Radio shows were great. He got me into Power Metal.\n\nThat's funny, I first came across him when he was doing PSR (PlanetSide Radio) before WoW and he introduced me to power metal through \"Emerald Sword\". \n\nHe also introduced me to one of my favorite bands \"Machinae Supremacy\".\n\nTB is directly responsible for keeping me from sliding into a right wing worldview. My family kept moving further that direction, watching TB helped me think about a lot of things more critically and opened me up to a wider variety of content creators.\n\nI still miss him, one of the greatest\n\nGNU TotalBiscuit\n\nFuck cancer! So much!\n\nLost one of my favorite YouTubers to it this very week.\n\nFuck cancer.\n\nRIP Paul Harrell\n\nPaul Harrell *forever.*\n\nI used to be a video editor for Jesse Cox in 2017-2018. Totalbiscuit was the nicest guy ever despite being known as the cynical Brit. Rest in piece, John\n\nMet him at a starcraft 2 tournament in 2011 or 2012. Got the chance to talk to him awhile. Super nice and seemed legitimately interested in what I was saying. Can't say enough good things about him.\n\nFirst thing you do when you boot up a new game: check the settings.\n\nHis podcast was great. No one has come even close ever since.\n\nIt's a different vibe without him, but the Geekenders pod with Jesse and Dodger has been pretty great since it started up again :)\n\nYooo its the weekend \n\n  \nRIP TB\n\nClosest thing I've found is dropped frames with JP who was on co-optional a few times\n\nThere's the Geekenders with Dodger and Jessie, watched a bit and can't quite get into to it without TB there.\n\nNot having a no-nonsense brit to counter balance mayhem and chaos just isnt the same.\n\nI still like it though\n\nLiterally the only pro-consumer games industry personality I've ever seen. He was so pro-us that game company devs tweeted hatred at him when he died. I'm never forgetting that guy.\n\nNever preorder. FOV slider or gtfo. 30fps unplayable.\n\nThere's also the opposite. Rebecca Ford, then community manager and now game director for Warframe, together with her co-host literally broke down during their monthly development livestream when the news came out and they ended the stream because they felt it was wrong to keep going. It was heartbreaking.\n\nAnd for those who think the comment is hyperbole, [it very much isn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYT2K_0oSYw).\nTB was instrumental in putting the spotlight on Warframe in his \"WTF is...\" series and DE themselves say that there was a \"before\" and an \"after\" the \"WTF is... Warframe\" video.\n\nTo say that his passing was an enormous loss is putting it VERY mildly.\n\nBefore was \"The only ads we could afford make our game look like a scam.\" and after was \"We are an actual real game with people playing it! A lot of them!\"\n\nI played it because of him, installed it on my crappy old laptop at the time and played at a whole 22fps it feels like…\n\nRoss Scott has taken up arms pretty vehemently against Anti consumer practices in gaming as of late.  He's gone from the Freeman's Mind guy to the \"Save The Crew\" guy.\n\nIt's worth mentioning that Ross is not specifically advocating to save The Crew. He's advocating to prevent *all* shutdowns of games that depend on a central server to be played. Whether through an offline patch or releasing the code so players can set up their own servers. These have both been done in the past to keep games running whereas nowadays, when developers say they are \"dropping support\" for a game, they mean \"killing it outright\".\n\nIt just so happens that The Crew dying was a big deal because it was sold as a good, not a service, and Ubisoft is a French developer and they have stronger consumer laws than the US. If anyone reading this would like to know what they can do to help out, go to [stopkillinggames.com](http://www.stopkillinggames.com) to find out. *Especially* if you are a member of the EU but most countries have something they can do.\n\nSidalpha while a much smaller channel has his Dirty Devs series which highlights anti-consumer BS\n\n\nBut yea TB was the light in the darkness\n\nI miss the man so much. I’ve still never found another podcast that scratched the itch like The Co-Optional podcast. It was the weirdest feeling in the world feeling like I lost a close friend who I had never met. \n\nRest in peace, TB. We still miss you.\n\nFor TB and iNcontrol, may the emperor forever guide their souls\n\nI can still hear his voice\n\nRIP, gone too soon\n\nHe's sorely missed.\n\nWe've never had a better advocate for gamers than this man.\n\n&amp;nbsp; \n\n&gt; \"_If ultimately you care about video games, if you're an enthusiast of video games, then the thing you want to be doing is educating and informing. Inform yourself to the greatest possible degree to minimize the number of mistakes that you make in purchase, and to make sure you have a full understanding of the situation going forward that you can share with others.\"_\n\n&gt; _\"Ignorance is the enemy. And ignorance is what breeds hatred. People who disagree with you are often more valuable than those that agree. They can give you a different perspective. Or if you're able to deconstruct their argument, they can inadvertently reinforce your own. And that is something that we should be embracing.\"_\n\n&gt; \\- [TotalBiscuit 2014](https://youtu.be/e78JRIHRjC0?t=1631)\n\nI knew John back before he became famous, we worked together on a tiny web radio for the first PlanetSide two decades ago. He was a good dude, great DJ and radio host. \n\nRIP John, I'm glad he was honored in one of the games I'm most excited about now, he would've been stoked.\n\nI'll always remember whispering him on WoW when I was a little barely a teenager to tell him I loved his YouTube channel and he took the time to actually sit and chat with me, I felt so honoured and it basically made my week❤️ he also introduced me to Rampage Knights which is one of my favourite games to this day. RIP John.\n\n\"EPIC\"\n\nWho was the loser that told him something along the lines of \"hope your cancer kills you\". Can't remember the SOB's name but i'm in the mood to hate on a mfer after being reminded of TB's death\n\nThere were many that wished him that when he made his diagnoses public. No point in harassing someone else about it either, no need to spread hate.\n\nKeemstar!\n\nKeemstar and the popularity of assholes like him make me lose hope in people. \n\nI remember Keemstar was one of the few people TB would publicly insult without any attempt at being cordial. He would normally attack arguments rather than character, but the guy was really just THAT much of a scumbag. \n\nI forget the exact wording, but I remember TB saying something along the lines of \"I have cancer, but at the very least I'm not Keemstar.\" Think it was a joke tweet or something like that.\n\nJessica Price (Delafina777 on Twitter, formerly of ArenaNet - \"formerly\" for good reason) was one of the people who did a bit of grave-dancing in the quote-tweets of TB's wife. It was vile.\n\nYou would not be playing Elden Ring on PC without that man.\n\nWait, is this the same “TotalBiscuit” that was the cynical Brit? Used to do WoW stuff? Holy shit.\n\nThe very same.\n\nTotalBiscuit’s story is why I never skip on getting myself checked out and don’t blow off the random “this hurts more than it should or this isn’t quite right today”. \n\nI never knew about his reviews and such until he had a few months left to live - but he’s made me healthier and increased the odds I’ll be around longer for my own loved ones.\n\nI genuinely feel like the Games Industry was unleashed to rapidly get shittier and shittier without it's most vigilant and professionally presenting watchdog.\n\nLike they waited for him to die. He had power and influence on companies, \\*especially\\* on options menus.\n\nLike I'm sorry James Sterling. She does good work, but sometimes you need people that suit up and lawyer up super-clean professional *to get corporations scared.* Crazy boglins isn't going to do it.\n\nSuit recognizes suit.\n\nDigital Foundry does a good job raking bad PC game practices over the coals, at least from a tech perspective.\n\nDigital Foundry: This game runs like shit\n\nPublishers: Yeah and?\n\nGames media also trashed him immediately after he died. Damned vultures. \n\nLUL in peace brother\n\nTB was the OG pro-consumer content creator o7\n\nI remain subbed to this man to this day, and will forever. A legend, a gentleman, and a scholar by all accounts. RIP to one of the greats.\n\nAw! That's really sweet of them remembering his adoration of Warhammer 40k!\n\nI still miss him, he is the person that got me from being a YouTube video viewer (as in watching some random vids) to a YouTube personality follower (being subscribed, watching someone’s new video when it came out, watching older videos etc). Made it even more sad that he passed away, because it was my first “YouTuber” I felt some sort of viewer connection to. \n\nNot only that I would also argue that he influenced and expanded the way I look at gaming and my gaming experiences. I really started to look and feel other things and aspects. \n\nSome people have tried to copy his review style, even fewer (partly) manage to do it… but nobody has ever come close. I will never forget him!\n\nRIP TB, the WTF series and the Polaris turned CO-OPtional Podcast were some of the best times of the internet. Everything was so full of passion and unclouded by greed.\n\nTotalBiscuit was the only real game critic I trusted to give me the raw truth of the game. He was the reason FOV sliders make it into so many more games. When we lost him we lost a special peice of the internet forever.\n\nRIP Total Biscuit. Fuck Cancer.\n\nHe surely is missed considering a lot of youtubers now are either shills or thrive on rage bait."

    "all_comment_text": "Howwsw???\n\nWe all know who the goty will be for 2025 😉\n\nHappy cake day\n\nThe OG gamers know that it’s well deserved…heck I can’t touch the modern games wearing gloves but this little one just brought the childhood joy to me. This is what games are all about.\n\nout of all, really didn't edpect astrobot to win. it's a cool paltformer and all, just not really goty. it must have been a real close call on judges i guess. also seems like wukong would not have won regardless, cuz china.\n\nwhat a lie\n\nso im so sad i play many good game and all goty desreved but the astro bot is not deserved this im not salty or angry just sad wukong desreved the goty in my heart i feel like this is ...... so sad\n\nJust from googling sales, wukong has 20x more sales than astrobot, is that information wrong? | edit: its not wrong, and just over half a month apart release dates | I know astrobot is a good game, but with that many more sales and still a similar rating, how did astrobot win?\n\nLate reply but sales don't equal quality, also Astrobot is bound to have lower sales given it's a PS5 exclusive\n\nAstrobot did have higher review scores, and it standing out from the photorealistic games and being a genre that doesn't see that much high quality releases anymore (3d platformers) really helped \n\nAll nominated games were great masterpieces, but astrobot really made a great impact because it felt like a breath of fresh air, and proved that \"100m budget cinematic experience\" games aren't inherently better than other ones\n\nExactly, it's a ps5 exclusive. what kind of GOTY is it when it can't even reach the majority of its audience. \n\nWe should just get fifa for GOTY every  year because for football players, that is the best game. Does this make sense?! \n\nAnd look at other GOTY they all had huge achievements, and all had one in common. People who weren't interested in the genre got the game. \n\nThe other Exclusive BOTW people bought switch just to play it. You can say a huge part of the switch's success is on BOTW, and it reinvented Open World kinda like skyrim did. Same with Elden ring people who weren't interested in Dark Souls and the same with BG3 Turn Based combat is dying out getting outdated BG3 Revived a whole ass genre. Why u think FF went into a real-time battle instead. \n\nAs for Wukong, many people upgraded their pc for it. It's the first Chinese AAA single-player PC game. It changes the gaming market in China, which shows what the pc gaming is capable of. instead of the phone gaming gacha cancer.\n\nI don't think anyone is going out of their way to buy a ps5 just to play astro it is a very good/fun game, but it's nowhere close to GOTY.\n\nwhat you say is true sale numbers don't always reflect, but 90% it's true look at steam chart and tell me top 10 or he'll even 20 isn't good game (I know banana game meme but that's why I said 90%) and also as much as I hate Genshin Impact I can't deny it's a good game for its audience. Cash grab = bad look what happened to AAA nowadays; also, I don't agree with gacha mechanics you should not be able to spend your whole life saving on games after all it's only entertaining not life especially when it's gambling and addictive. I mean, people can do whatever they want, but it doesn't make it right. You can also spend your whole life saving on a Panting/Art, but you can always get a portion of it back. As soon as you spend in the game, it becomes worth less. the money you spent is just gone, especially when Genshin Impact dies. Art or other physical items, on the other hand, can even increase in value with time if you are lucky.\nI was the first 1000 player to play Genshin Impact, but I quit after a week. It was too much of BOTW copy at the time. Everything was free and not much content yet, but I knew how costly/grindy the game became later. It doesn't respect your time it wants your money.\n\nI totally see where you're coming from, but having played all of them, I did enjoy Astrobot the most. Maybe it was my burnout from soulslike game and that I didn't play a good 3d platformer in a good while? But yeah, it felt like a reminder why I loved videogames: it was pure fun. And for that alone it deserved the title as games are supposed to be fun first and foremost \n\nThe other goty that felt this way to me too was it takes two, as once again it really stood out from the rest and is still one of the most memorable experiences I ever had\n\nIt's too bad that it's a ps5 exclusive (but to be fair the dualsense features are a huge part of the experience) and it's a shame so many people are missing out on the game. Accessibility is obviously a good criterea but I don't think they consider that in any awards show. It's just rating the experience\n\nGood point, Agreed. Same, I was burnt out by Elden Ring and convergence mod. I stopped at Act 3, but many of my friends did 100% achievements. Maybe someday I will go back and finish it. I judge GOTY by impact on gamers and gaming industry. ofcause positive impact\n\nreally late reply but how did this shit win for family its a single player game\n\nRelax people. Just a few more days and everything will be alright...next game awards will be under the trump administration and the voting will be too big to rig. \n\nDeserved\n\nIsn't game of the year a weird idea in the first place? It's like if I tried to compare a quarterback and a kicker. \n\nAnd I thought Balatro was the worst nominee in GOTY\n\nplease keep your trash opinions to yourself\n\ngood for astro 🙏\n\nConsidering that this comment section consists mostly of two types of comments: those who disagree with the outcome, and the others who ridicule them, I think it is safe to say that GOTY is not an award for the masses. \n\nCongratulations to the PS5 owners for their exclusive privilege of enjoying something most cannot.\n\nHappy Cake Day!\n\nAnyone who knows anything about this shit knows that goty is bought, not awarded 🤣\n\nNot in the case of this game, it is stunningly well made\n\nLooks like Mario. Heard it's pretty similar.\n\nStunningly? C'mon dude, Say No to Cope.\n\nLol, another person that hasn't played it\n\nA stunning assessment.\n\nBy a stunningly handsome poster\n\nI don't think its out of the question but I wouldn't hate on the game or the developer's regardless. (Especially if you haven't even played the game)\n\n\nHating on sony is fair it's a greedy corporation it deserves some hate.\n\nAll people talking shit diddnt play it or didn't take time to bother trying the other system out you may be loyal to one but when they both merge like everything else is doing you shit talkers are just going to look like ass holes\n\nNah, nah. Y'all the shit talkers, acting like Asstrobot is better than Black Myth: Wukong.\n\nGOTY: Bought and paid for by Sony\n\nPs look up the game the new chronos game. It's an Xbox exclusive but u can already wishlist it on ps5 through google\n\nGood for Astro\n\nGood for Astro\n\nBest game I’ve played in a long long time\n\nBest game I’ve played in a long long time\n\nJoke Of The Year 2024\n\ncry\n\nOnly on PS5 , what a joke\n\nregardless of if ill be downvoted im gonna say this, the users of this platform carry as much weight with me on average as a head of cabbage, but its really insane no one put together the fact Sony is a laughable, shady, downright shitty company and has always been, throughout all time, and that they would obviously pay for votes for their MID super mario galaxy wannabe to win goty. their MID platformer which is nothing but a mario inspired game thats \\*OMG\\* not on a nintendo console. its nothing special. Sony is a bunch of immoral sons of bitches and anyone who believes this game legimately won is naive\n\nIt won fair and square get over it. It got glowing reviews from both Critics and Users on metacritic. It won GOTY from multiple publications not just The game awards. Multiple YouTubers who played it praised it. \n\nYou're just in denial and are mad that the company you hate so much released a great game.\n\nNo one is arguing the game isn't good or even great. But you would truly prop this game up as GOTY? Next to the likes of God of War, Elden Ring, The Witcher, Baldur's Gate, etc. Astro Bot compares to these? Really? Come on bro.\n\nYou are forgetting \"It Takes Two\". That was a cooperative narrative platformer and it won a few years ago.\n\nYes, i would because it excels at a great design and has engaging gameplay. More so than some of those games listed. If you're like me and can recognize good game design you can understand why Astro Bot won.\n\nIt's Mario for Sony. If Mario Odyssey didn't win GOTY then Astro Bot shouldn't either.\n\nWhat are you even trying to say here? Mario Odyssey came out in a very competitive year. It lost to another game by the same company...\n\nYeah, but, Metacritic has collective, deep-fried brain.\n\nIGN does horrid reviews and even they gave the game a 9/10, it's just that good\n\nIf you think this game won fair and square. then you are extremely naive and delusional. of the fact that, the video game awards have always been rigged\n\nYou never played the game and it's obvious. It's perfection. No bugs, no microtransactions, no bullshit. Name another good game that released this polished in the last 10 years\n\nRDR2, GoW 2018, Half Life Alyx (Amazing VR game). just to name a few. The fact that FF7 Rebirth lost over Astrobot, proves that the game awards ARE rigged. Its always been rigged and will always be. FF7 rebirth is more then a remake. Its a reimaging of a game that improves on it in almost every way.\n\nRDR 2 definitely had bugs I ran into quite a few. FF7 is not even half the game Astro Bot is. It is a remake still. At least Elden Ring DLC didn't win. Only other game in the running in my opinion was Wukong\n\nElden Ring DLC shouldn't even been nominated. It's a DLC. No Dlc should ever be nominated. DLC is not the actual game.\n\nYou're the naive one here. i actually played the damn game for one. It's a fact that it won more GOTY awards than the other games. I can provide a link if you'd like.\n\nI see reddit is still a joke, people downvoting other people because of opinion, but its really insane no one put together the fact Sony is a laughable, shady, downright shitty company and has always been, throughout all time, and that they would pay for votes for their MID game to win goty. their MID platformer which is nothing but a mario inspired game, not on a nintendo console. its nothing special. Sony is a bunch of immoral sons of bitches and anyone who believes this game legimately won is so naive its pitiful.\n\nThe game creator wore the influence on his sleeve and told the audience that the game was inspired by him playing Super Mario when he was a young boy. At least for the developer, they didn't try to outshine Mario. You have to be able to separate the developer from the producer. Most producers nowadays drag developers through the mud until they close and are blamed instead for the producers greedy decisions. I agree that Sony sucks, but the game doesn't. It was a passion project for the indie studio that developed it. (And got the award).\n\nI have seen some people stating, \"Sony finally has their own Mario\", and it's pathetic.\n\nMen hate silly and just fun games, since when everything has to be souls-like or dark themed to win any type of recognition\n\n90% Jury to 10% vote, games industry people jerking themselves off. The game can be done in a night or two, and has nothing more to it. What are you saying.\n\nyou realize thats pretty incendiary? as a man i appreciate the game, but i think games are also an art piece at a certain point, and astro bot being better art than some of the other contenders...? I don't think people realize Sony is a soulless company who would obviously pay for fake votes.\n\nyou realize thats pretty incendiary? as a man i appreciate the game, but i think games are also an art piece at a certain point, and astro bot being better art than some of the other contenders...? I don't think people realize Sony is a shit company who would obviously pay for fake votes.\n\nI dont even care about sony itself, it's more over the fact that this is a GAME, it's supposed to be silly, cute, enjoyable and fun, having grown ass adults whining becasue they are pressed that their unsaturated, serious themed, completely normative game like the hundreds that are out there and basically have been running whats mainstream \"is\" for decades doesn't get it just ONE time, if you look at games at experiences and art, each one should be unique and yet we have a lot of the same out there\n\nYou are whining about people whining that the game won. Whether Sony \"cheated\" or not, it won. Don't sit here and highroad other games for choosing to be dark, which is a perfectly acceptable genre. Dont judge games by their covers and actually play them.\n\nStay mad edgyboy, have some color and fun in your life for once\n\n😂\n\n[removed]\n\nesports games are a handful of titles in a couple(few) genres. Lmao\n\nNo where near the context that was stated.. Thanks for learning english.\n\nyoure middle management for a specific niche in a hobby, you of course have heard about every game, apologies\n\nI haven't been middle management since.. 2008.. sooo.. lol\n\nIf you haven't heard of this game, that's on you. It's literally the most advertised game around. I was unable to escape it, and I don't even own a Playstation. \n\nIt's not an Esport game, but honestly Esports are becoming less and less interesting every year.\n\nIt's a bot/sockpuppet account.\n\nIt's a bot/sockpuppet account.\n\nSams.\n\nI literally.  LITERALLY. Never heard of this game...  and I'm running content management for 3 Esports teams.  I have sponsorship deals with Nintendo... and developing a new online tournament bracket system for most major games and have conversations with many studios....  \n\nNever.. Heard.. Of.. This game....?\n\nSponsoring of the year*\n\nSony Awards\n\nHahahahah, I guess the bar was pretty low this year. Another game awards year another time being proven that this event is a joke. \n\nsingle console games should be dq'd for goty consideration, that's my only opinion on the award as a whole.\n\nOh you'd sure love Nintendo games then\n\ni absolutely include nintendo games... nintendo screwed up and missed out on a huge cash cow if they had ported botw, hell all of the zelda series, to PC.\n\nI was being sarcastic but yes I agree. If Nintendo went full digital for PC games then there's very little other gaming companies would have that would compare\n\nCompetitive scenes in Nintendo are as small as they are because... Well... Nintendo\n\nMonster Hunter Rise was a Nintendo console exclusive before being released on PC, because Capcom realized they fucked up. Monster Hunter World having been a pc release and being far above and beyond Rise\n\nNow imagine Zelda games, Pokemon games, Mario, Splatoon, etc etc. if Nintendo just went full blown PC they can make some ridiculous games\n\nyeah i got downvoted so v0v to my reply\n\nnintendo doesn't get that console players are gonna stay console players even if N ports their games to PC as well, many will even buy for both. Hell I own a switch and a couple games on both PC and Switch. ex: Skyrim cause i'm an idiot, and NMS because it's awesome.\n\nI admit I had a great emulator and loved playing BOTW on my widescreen PC monitor.\n\nOK. I've never played it, so I won't judge.\n\nOnly sensible comment I have read so far lmao.\n\n\nAnd yeah I agree tbh idk how great astrobot is because I haven't played it and I don't mind it winning GOTY personally.\n\nI beat Astro's Playroom and doing Astro Bot ATM, it's surprisingly very unique but not in a groundbreaking way (and that's okay). \n\nIt excels in creativity and what it decides to do with its (Sony's) assets, all of it. Yes all of Sony's IP is somehow incorporated into the game in some way and it's really fun to experience.\n\nThey also implemented a Pikmin type mechanic where you can use your bot buddies to help carry things, unlock things, or forms ladders to get to new areas or get new loot.\n\nThere are a tons of collectibles for people that like to loot and unlock everything. \n\nIt finds ways to squeeze the most use out of all the functions of the controller: shaking, blowing, motion, varying vibrations, varying pressures, touchpad.\n\nIt's not perfect but I definitely say it's a very fun game and there's nothing really like it. A big part of the allure is definitely nostalgia due to the incorporation of Sony's IPs. Seeing a Solid Snake bot and a Crash Bandicoot bot running around to help you is just hilarious.\n\nOnly thing i know about Astrobot, it have Soul Reaver reference, that i have on my PS1.\n\nOK. I've never played it, so I won't judge.\n\nCompletely and utterly undeserved. Disgusting.\n\nPLAYING ASTRO BOT IN 2024 IS CRAZYYYYYYYYYYYY. BRO IS PLAYING GAME FOR KIDSSSSSSS, KIDS ARE VOTING FOR GOTY. BRO DID NOT HAVE A PC 🎉\n\nThis message made me sick to my stomach. This game just came out, it is literally a love letter to the ps5 controller, the story is good and the gameplay is better. Since this is just an opinion, I'll have to respect yours...

What are these dumbasses even crying about?\n\nFuck astro bot and fuck goty\n\nKeep crying from the sore losers stand, that'll change things! \n\nFind a hobby.\n\nYet another year Sony paid for never forget that the last of us part two got game of the year over ghost of Tsushima\n\nah yes, sony pays for their ps title to win over their ps title...you do realize they're both ps studio games so either way sony wins right?\n\ni get we're salty but let's at least use logic people\n\nThere is no way a game that has a 5.8 user score should get game of the year if u don’t see that a suspicious idk what to tell you\n\nbcuz it's the academy who vote not users... if u prefer user then People Choice award is a better option for u. Also by that logic, I think Taylor Swift won AOTY for her 1989 album is deserving bcuz 1989 was the most that popular consider that Kendrick was also in the same category for his TPAB which is considered the greatest album of 10s decade, but didn't make much noise like 1989 did...\n\nthe last of us was hyped for 7 years, got never had a chance\n\nSo it was still garbage every one agreed that it was\n\nopinion, not a fact\n\nTake a look at the  meta critic scores my guy it’s a pretty universally shared sentiment\n\nmore people like part 2 than people who hate it.\n\n76k negative reviews 87 k average score 5.8 positive for the last of us part two now let’s compare that with ghost to Tsushima universal acclaim score 9.2 815 negative reviews 20k positive by these metrics one is clearly better than the other they both came out during the same year when you look at the data points, it is clear as to what happened\n\ngo to the last of us subreddit and the people there are chill with it. r/LastOfUs2, however...\n\n76k negative reviews 87 k average score 5.8 positive for the last of us part two now let’s compare that with ghost to Tsushima universal acclaim score 9.2 815 negative reviews 20k positive by these metrics one is clearly better than the other they both came out during the same year when you look at the data points, it is clear as to what happened\n\nno way\n\nmy honest opinion:\n\n-Balatro: literaly made by only one guy just expected 6 sells and goes to a game awards this is incredible and the game is addicting\n\n-astrobot: Im not kidding when i say this game at first time i thought that was simply a demo to buy a PS5 ..., not saying this is bad game but looks like franchising game\n\n-Wukong: i say the game but i thought another souls game OK cool i like souls like\n\nPs: balatro deserved One guy vs Sony its incredible how this is possible\n\nYour thinking of astros playroom mate\n\nYes now makes sense why i thought about that haha\nMaybe in the future the PS4 VR gonna be like 40€ used condition to play that games\n\nAlso why so hate in my comment  i dont speak nothing about this 3 games i like to play each one but time is complicated and i ONLY play balatro because it  supports android so to me is the One i can enjoy time a time\n\nGotta be honest. I must be out of touch cause I didn’t know this game even existed let alone why it was in a category with Wukong and FF7 Rebirth. I kept hitting buttons on the computer screen on their website which greys out the other games but highlights Astro Bot. I was like, “Okay but who won!!! Wait what is this /scratches head.”\n\nGotta be honest. I must be out of touch cause I didn’t know this game even existed let alone why it was in a category with Wukong and FF7 Rebirth. I kept hitting buttons on the computer screen on their website which greys out the other games but highlights Astro Bot. I was like, “Okay but who won!!! Wait wtf is this /scratches head.”\n\nNot deserved.\n\nDeserved\n\nWhy and how is that possible? There are so many great and better games\n\nJust find out that it is mainly \"journalist\" who vote for GOTY.\n\nI agree.\n\nMan, the \"bots\" and sockpuppets are REALLY coming out of woodworks with this one and it's SUPER hilarious.\n\nfucking hell.....gets worse every year\n\nI was eyeing this one for a while, I had fun with the built-in thing on the PS5, I am going to have to grab it and play it.\n\nBesides I have not touched my PS5 in a while...this would give me a good reason to play it again.\n\nI dont get the hate on exclusivity. Where was the hate when BOTW won 2017?\n\nBecause it was a massive improvement compared to their competitors\n\nOr TLOU, GoW, and Ghost of Tsushima when THOSE won and got noms before they went multiplat. It's all just bullshit culture war posturing.\n\nAre you trying to pretend those games didnt get gare for exclusivity?\n\n\nBoth GoW and GoT got hate for being exclusive snd TLOU2 got hate for a while lot of other reasons.\n\n\nTLOU2 got hate for a bunch of reasons but not for being exclusive cuz anyone hardly gave a crap that joke of a game was exclusive omao\n\nMan. This game winning really HAS brought out every single bot and sockpuppet account out of the woodworks.\n\nSo basically you had no argument against facts regarding all 3 of your dumb as rocks examples since your claims were moronic.\n\nA primary student got 100 points and a college student got 80 points. So the primary student are smarter than the college student? haha it's ridiculous.\n\nNever played but i do play black myth wukong, love the game but the ending was messy, optimize bad\n\n[removed]\n\nWhenever there is injustice people raise their voice, it's like saying French revolution was started by butthurt people.\n\nGet over it quickly.\n\nBegone\n\nThose people so hurt the cute robot win, either they can't get the game because they only have pc, or they just too salty their chinese spyware didn't win lol\n\nJust get all platforms and enjoy all games if you're  actually \"hardcore\" gamers you guys claim to be lol\n\nThere are so many better criticisms of Wukong than \"Chinese spyware\" especially considering you're probably American and will acknowledge how much spying America does on its own citizens.\n\nCalling Wukong Chinese Spyware because it's made by a Chinese developer is literally stereotyping for the sake of dehumanizing a game🤦‍♂️\n\nAlso the issue for me isn't that they won its that they make it seem like it was just chosen by gamers when it doesn't make much sense that a game with less sold copies by 10x and less public eye got more votes than any of the other's, I don't blame astro bot as it does sound good from what I looked up, I blame GOTY for adding Dlc and Remakes to the nominees making everyone vote for literally anything but those two when imo Helldivers and Space marine to be nominated (mainly helldivers)\n\nThe G in GOTY stands for game, and last I checked DLC is an add on  for a game, not a game in and of itself. I can plainly see that SOTET could have straight up been a sequel, but it wasn't. \n\nRemakes however, I'm quite torn on. On one hand there are remakes that are completely different games to the original, remakes that took something messy, clunky, and hard to play, and turned them into masterpieces and I definitely think those deserve a shot at GOTY. On the other hand, some remakes just slap a thin coat of paint on the same game, and those don't even deserve a nomination. The problem is you can't pick and choose which should be allowed, either all remakes should be eligible or none should.\n\nSince most aren't loved i say give them a best Remake and dlc category and shouldn't be put on game of the year as that should be just reserved for newly fully fleshed games released as of that year\n\nThe G in GOTY stands for game, and last I checked DLC is an add on  for a game, not a game in and of itself.

Lol what\n\nIf you have a PS5 or access to one, please please please try out Astro's Playroom, the default tech demo game pre installed on every system. \n\nIt's the most impactful controller innovation since the Wii without any of the frustration of waggling. It's a pure, direct upgrade with no downside. It's extremely organic and really does enhance the controller experience in a way I think is potentially as impactful as the joystick.\n\nI do all my gaming or well 90% of it on playstation. \n\n\nNever bothered trying astroroom because it looks dum as rocks and sure as fk aint never going to pay 70 bucks for a p.o.s like astro bot lmao. \n\n\nEven 40 bucks would be overpriced lmao. \n\n\nLiterally every game out there, from the selections, deserved it more than astro bot except maybe belatro \n\nThat's literally what I thought too but then I had a game that took an hour to copy and download updates so I decided why not?\n\nAt first I was like wtf is this? But then I found out it's bigger and more creative than I thought. It's actually a lot of fun. It's like a Nintendo platformer but reskinned with a bot theme. \n\nI'm not saying it deserves GOTY but it's way better than people think aside from this GOTY debacle.\n\nMisspelling dumb is just the cherry on top of your wonderful comment.\n\nagreed\n\nPlease know that you are the exact type of person people laugh at when they read your comments.\n\nD1 glazer.\n\nI don't support exclusives, ever.\n\nEdit: You can downvote me all you want. I'm not going to support that anti-consumer behavior. I have plenty of games to play. Deal with it.\n\nSee I'm on the other side, I just find the money to buy every console, so I can support ALL exclusives, when a game comes out, on the Xbox (Series X), PlayStation (PS5 disc) or Switch or even Steam (steamdeck and PC), I am ready to play them.\n\nWhy fight it, when you can enjoy it..\n\nMore power to you dude. Vote with your wallet however you see fit.\n\nI've been doing the same thing from the Atari days. When everyone had a NES, I had a Master system as well. When people had a SNES, I had a Sega genesis and Turbo Graphics console as well.  We can go up from there for each gen.\n\nMost of my life I have had at least 6 consoles setup that I could play at all times, right now I have 9... Also always wired for the best possible picture.  My Current setup can do up to 8K 60hz (normally 4K 120hz) and even has a scaler for the retro consoles I have setup, the perk, you can't really see a single wire and all automated.....\n\nNever felt a problem with exclusives because of how I game.... Hated them back in the early day, this is why I do this.\n\nTruth be told, you don't support exclusives, YOUR LOSS.\n\nIf you played it you'd know why its exclusive to Playstation... The game is essentially a fan fare and *history* of playstation and their own ip's in a game.  \nIt is however the only game I've finished in recent history because its damn good game (as a pc player myself) and it wasn't even my playstation.\n\nOh, so it's practically a PlayStation fangirl thread. That explains why everyone is so upset that I won't play exclusives. But hey, my money, my choice.\n\nMake sure you also don't play games that are only available for Windows exclusively, and not for other OS and consoles, okay?\n\nbased.\n\nThen don't. Funny dude online think he's some member of justice league lmao\n\nUnless its an exclusive you like of course\n\nNope\n\nHoly Fuck they robbed Wukong from GOTY. \n\nLook at the history of past winners—every single one had a massive impact on gaming.\n\nAstro Bot is a good, fun game, but as an exclusive, it lacks the reach that other GOTY had. After all what kind of GOTY is it if it can't reach majority of its audience. Compare to the other exclusive, Breath of the Wild, which completely redefined the Zelda franchise, introducing revolutionary mechanics that inspired games like Genshin Impact. Or take Elden Ring, which expanded Dark Souls to a wider audience and introduced countless players to the \"Soulslike\" genre, sparking a wave of imitators. Last year's GOTY, Baldur's Gate 3, went even further, reviving an entire genre with incredible player choice and narrative depth.\n\nNow consider Wukong: the first AAA Chinese game, built on rich source material, with impressive player agency, combat, and storytelling. It’s a groundbreaking achievement, fitting for a GOTY title. While Astro Bot is undeniably fun, it's no where near the level of innovation, influence, or genre-defining impact that past winners have brought to the industry.\n\nI have to disagree, I don't think Wu Kong is that good. That being said, I don't think Astro Bot should be goty either, 2024 just doesn't have any game that spells goty for me.\n\nAs a Chinese, of course, I am glad to see a AAA title developed by a Chinese company, but much like the Chinese film industry wanting to producing blockbuster films like Hollywood, WuKong, at its core, is the chinese gaming industry wanting to produce something that has been invented/started by someone else, their innovation is the fusion of authentic Chinese culture and existing/proven game genre/mechanics, that is far more significant for Chinese players/industry than rest of the planet, at best, it could have made western developers feel threatened and wanting to improve their product, but that has yet to be seen.\n\nTBH wukong isn't 100% my type Elden Ring is. I play so much ER and Covergence Mod I was super burnt out I didn't even finished Act 3 (Many of my chinese friends did 100% tho). But i can see its potential. Someone gotta take the first step/shot rome wasn't built in one day (As for the first game its pretty impresive they never had any groundworks). I am just glad its going/can go this direction much better then gatcha cash grab. I still remeber an anime i used to watch when i was 10-12 星游记 it was a One Piece Copy sure but man was it fun. Too bad at that time Anime industry was too under developed u could say 星游记 was too advanced for its time. it was the first anime instead of cartoon now days manhua and anime are everywhere and yes china is trying to copy japan but i don't think its a bad thing copy, learn, improve. China has a rich history we should used that at our advantage\n\nI have to disagree, I don't think Wu Kong is that good. That being said, I don't think Astro Bot should be goty either, 2024 just doesn't have any game that spells goty for me.\n\nAs a Chinese, of course, I am glad to see a AAA title developed by a Chinese company, but much like the Chinese film industry wanting to producing blockbuster films like Hollywood, WuKong, at its core, is the chinese gaming industry wanting to produce something that has been invented/started by someone else, their innovation is the fusion of authentic Chinese culture and existing/proven game genre/mechanics, that is far more significant for Chinese players/industry than rest of the planet, at best, it could have made western developers feel threatened and wanting to improve their product, but that has yet to be seen.\n\nyoure absolutely right dude. Sadly there are lots of kids here, there's no need to argue with kids who won't get it. Wukong's story, graphics everything was top notch\n\nWukong is THE Elden Ring copy HAHAH Where the fuck is it innovative?\n\nBy your standards, Astro Bot definitely shouldn’t win Game of the Year because it’s essentially just another Mario Copy. \n\nI define Game of the Year by the influence it has on gaming as a whole, and if you understand a bit more about Chinese culture, you’d realize what a groundbreaking moment *Black Myth: Wukong* is for the Eastern gaming market.\n\nHistorically, China’s gaming industry has been dominated by pay-to-win, cash-grab, and gacha games. Gaming culture there is vastly different; people rarely use PCs for gaming or even work. Most gaming happens on mobile devices, with titles like *Call of Duty Mobile* being far more popular than PC or console games. This reliance on mobile gaming has created a market saturated with low-quality, high-profit games.\n\n*Black Myth: Wukong* is revolutionary because it’s China’s first true AAA single-player game developed for PC, showcasing world-class quality on par with top Western titles. This is a monumental step forward, not just for Chinese gaming but for the global perception of games developed in China. If *Wukong* succeeds, it could inspire more developers in China to move away from mobile-centric, cash-driven models and start creating high-quality games for PC and consoles. It has the potential to shift the market focus from mobile to PC, which could reshape China’s entire gaming landscape. This kind of cultural and industry impact cannot be overstated.\n\nNow compare that to *Astro Bot*. Sure, it’s a fun game, but it doesn’t bring anything groundbreaking to the table. It doesn’t push boundaries or redefine the industry in any meaningful way. For me, *Wukong*’s influence on the Chinese market and its potential to ignite a wave of AAA PC game development in a region previously dominated by mobile gaming is far more impactful and deserving of recognition.\n\nWukong is the worse rated goty nominee since TGA's inception.\n\nIf who developed it mattered, then balatro had a massive genre defining impact with a solo dev, but I don't see any argument for it being robbed. Also how is Wukong the first Chinese aaa game when Genshin impact that you mentioned exist ?\n\nDon't get me wrong it's a very decent game, but it was definitely not robbed\n\nDefinitely robbed. Wukong had no chance of winning. Change the whole jury to Chinese and developers of Wukong. Oh no I wonder who will win now\n\nI never who said developed mattered. For me its impact on chinese gaming market. I focus on how big of a positive splash the game made to determine GoTY. Genshin impact is a mobile/gacha not AAA\n\nI totally understand what you're saying but let me guess, you are considered a hardcore gamer. Think for a moment about what astrobot means to kids. It is a game that will introduce video games to millions of kids all over the world. Sometimes we forget that most people don't play everyday like some of us. Kids between 5 and 12 wil play this game and I imagine will feel like I did at ten when I first played mario brothers. They will find more joy in astrobot than we did on our first run through Black Myth Wukong, or how we'll feel during our first run through night in. I think it was just a choice that could have went either way. Im sure the devs that created BMW will give goty another run with their next ip. At least I hope so.\n\nThis is well said, lots of gamers on the Internet would only approve something that is sophisticated, and with certain difficulties, my 7 year old son loved Astro playroom, but Mario Odessey is too much hassle for him.\n\nGood games are not only the ones that require dedicated effort, or so-called \"skill\", but also the ones that focus on having fun for a good range of age, Astro Bot is a game like that, if someone can't find it fun to play Astro Bot, or thinks it is \"dumb\", that is his/her problem, not the game's.\n\nTrue. diffrent games are made for diffrent people and/or diffrent ago group. You don't have to enjoy golfing / fishing if you don't find it interesting. I think problem is a worng word to use here more like opinion. That been said game awards's targeted audiance isn't 7yr old, its some teenager + mainly 20-30 then 30+. Its like if they put in bunch of awards in there for favorite politician, celebrities. Nobody is gonna like that because it isn't \"Game\" awards anymore it isn't targeting at its main audiance \"gammers\". They could totally make a seperated award for best kid game, best games for all age (i know there is a family category). But they didn't why? cuz there isn't enough 7 yr old watching. And about what he said of hardcore gammers, Let me ask you this if you car broke down would you go to someone who has been fixing everyday for 50+ years or someone who only fixed car once in their life? I don't think Elon Musk is very accurate to GoTY and there is nothing wrong with that there is more than games in life and he is very busy man. But here is the thing he isn't the targeted audiance either nor do i think he care about GoTY. I do appreciate Astro Bot and more kids game is good, but it had no business in GoTY. What kind of GoTY is it if Alot of \"Gamer\" don't even have access to it?! (Alot of people still don't have a PS5, I have a 4090 all other Max spec. 64gb ram, 14th gen i9, etc. what do i need PS5 for?) what kind of GoTY is it if Alot of \"Gamer\" haven't even heard of it before.\n\nConclusion: targeted audiance. why focus on the minority when GoTY is About majority of the \"Gammers\"\n\nThis is well said, lots of gamers on the Internet would only approve something that is sophisticated, and with certain difficulties, my 7 year old son loved Astro playroom, but Mario Odessey is too much hassle for him.\n\nGood games are not only the ones that require dedicated effort, or so-called \"skill\", but also the ones that focus on having fun for a good range of age, Astro Bot is a game like that, if someone can't find it fun to play Astro Bot, or thinks it is \"dumb\", that is his/her problem, not the game's.\n\nIs it true that companies pay to \"win\" awards for more exposure?\n\nIf that was the case cod would be winning all year because of how much money they generate\n\nCod doesnt need exposure you dumbass \n\nSame with Fifa and other sports games. Those games sell more than most of the GOTY noms combined.\n\nI doubt, if so, Veilguard should've win\n\nI doubt that, with Veilguard sales, they couldn't afford that.\n\nNot at all. Complete conspiracy theory that people say when they don't understand that other people might like a different game to them.\n\nWhat other people?\n\n\nGame sold only like 1.5mil copies compared to wukong 20 mil \n\n\nIf you gonna argue about the people let me remind you wukong won people choice award my guy\n\nWell deserved!"

    "all_comment_text": "In the US, AI generated content is not protected by copyright law, so I do wonder what this means for fair use of their assets\n\nbatch edit all the assets with a filter/change a pixel so theyre no longer 100% AI generated?\n\nUnder US copyright law the original work has to be significantly changed, changing a pixel it doing a color shift wouldn't cut it\n\ngood! TIL\n\nThen only that pixel is copyrightable, and the rest of the work is public domain. The courts see through tricks like this. Enjoy that one pixel!\n\nI didn't expect Microsoft to spend all of that money on AI to not try to increase production and decrease costs.\n\nI know right! Im shocked. Shocked. Well not that shocked\n\nI'm actually surprise there aren't more of them really.\n\nThere probably are, but you haven't heard about them because they're not as big.\n\nPeople think that AI will be used to make more complex/larger games. In reality it'll be used to make cookie cutter generic games while employing the minimum amount of people possible.\n\nLike  A.I 'art'  it'll be used to spam out content, especially gun skins and recolours\n\nThat's the problem. I've been fascinated with AI long before ChatGPT came around. But watching it evolve has honestly become a bit frightening. Honest to god, in just a few years it's going to be fucking insane the things any Joe-Shmoe can do with it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBut that's besides my point. The problem isn't that Ai is being used in video games. I think the potential there would be fucking amazing. **The problem** is that it's being used for monetization purposes. AI can have its place in video game development, but its a pretty sore sight to see that the first implementations of it are being used for store bundles to be sold to players for profit. It feels scummy. What's worse is they're maximizing their profits even further by laying off a chunk of 2D model artists at the same time. And lets be real: In reality it isn't benefitting us players at all. Warzone is still a buggy mess with shit performance and cheaters running rampant.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI've done some actual pretty deep serious research into Activison as a company, how they started and their rise to massive success. And I gota say, it's been some backstabbing, Hollywood movie type drama from the beginning. The whole company is pretty fucking awful.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; **EDIT:** Getting a lot of responses asking why I am surprised. I am **not** surprised at all. Feel free to go through my post history, you'll likely find a lot of stupid shit, but years back you'll see I talking about how this would happen, and expressed that many, *many* times in multiple gaming subreddits. But yeah, I appreciate everyone's \"WhY aRe YoU SurPriSeD!? CaPiTaLiSiM bRo\" Let's try to have an original thought here people, your comments are all identical, which defeats the point you're trying to make by coming off somehow far more intelligent than you actually are, lol.\n\nIt's really sad to think about, these games are always online but they don't use the AI to adapt to a player, you can have Bots battling in every game but they don't use the AI to make them change and adapt to the players.\n\nInstead they use AI to do the easiest shit and take away the jobs that people love to do.\n\nLike that one tweet, I wanted AI to do the bullshit work stuff for me so I can draw, write, and play games. I didn't want AI to do the art stuff while I still am forced to do mind numbing dumbshit busy work for boomer bosses.\n\nUnfortunately that's the problem with automation.....\n\nPeople don't trust AI with the \"boring stuff\" as it usually is sensitive or critical.....\n\nI.e Judgement passing on quality checking to pass/fail batches or lots.\n\nAnd creativity/art are always seen as \"secondary nice to haves but not needed\"....\n\nFunction \\&gt; Form is the sad truth.... and this is the doomer scenario when you bring said idea (AI) to an environment where it's all about Form.\n\nAlso the truth is that for a lot of boring stuff, humans are cheaper than robots (at least in a quarterly profit sense). All of these implementations we're seeing are just the laziest, least effort and expense approaches.\n\nIt doesn't help that a significant majority of the AI tech bros these days are also part of the corporate malfeasance defence force.\n\nThe earliest example of AI in gaming that I remember was putting an AI against pro League players and seeing it beat them. I was so excited for the possibilities. Where did it all go so wrong...\n\nThe different AI in Perfect Dark N64 was ahead of its time. Having 11 different bots running around, all with different rules they follow. PacifistSim, VengefulSim, JudgeSim, CowardSim, etc.\n\nYup. I used to use bots in games way back then that would be that exact way. They were even customizable. I kinda miss that.\n\nTHEY WERE CUSTOMIZABLE! Omg I forgot about that, because you can create premade game setups and have them all have custom names too, lol! Wow, that game seriously was so ahead of its time, I swear.\n\nYou mean dota.\n\nThe players back then were hamstrung with ridiculous restrictions, didn’t really count. Now I’m sure an AI bot could beat most pros in almost any circumstances.\n\nThe type of AI you are thinking of is not Chat GPT. Chat GPT is a predictive language model. Video game \"AI\" is just a bunch of deterministic scripts. Nothing is happening in real time as far as decision making goes. Machine learning has been used to make \"AI\" for games like Starcraft but that is still a far cry from what I believe you are playing at.\n\nThis misunderstanding of what AI is capable of is what these tech companies are banking on. They want you to think AI is smart just like Elon Musk wants you to believe cars will be full self driving by 2018.\n\nIt's weird isn't it.\n\nIt's like the whole world just collectively forgot that AI meant machines thinking for themselves a la Skynet/Terminator.\n\nwhen it comes to multiplayer games AI is being used in more insidious ways like for engagement-based matchmaking, something COD has been known to have been doing for a while, where they intentionally adjust who you match with and even tweak hit registration slightly to make you perform slightly better versus your opponents when you've recently purchased a cosmetic item, to make you subconsciously associate having fun with spending money on cosmetics.\n\nIf it is done that is awful, but I would really like some sources for a wild claim like that.\n\nApparently, Activision has patented both a \"skill based\" hit registration system, as well as using skins to put people into easier lobbies. My guess is they're probably using those.\n\nLike how tasbot used AI to live play smash against humans, that was fun to watch\n\n&gt; The problem isn't that Ai is being used in video games. I think the potential there would be fucking amazing. The problem is that it's being used for monetization purposes.\n  \nThis is pretty much always how generative AI is going to be used. It’s designed to replace human labor, partially or completely. You might hope “oh well ideally devs could use it to save labor on tedious tasks so they spend more time on XYZ that will make the game good.” And sure, in theory that COULD happen. And maybe some smaller devs will use it a bit like that. But in the vast majority of cases, it will be used to cut labor costs down to an absolute minimum, replacing humans wherever it can save a buck or two.\n\nIn a capitalist society, the first to monetize new tech gets a huge advantage. It’s not at all surprising that AI is used immediately to reduce labor costs. Ai will undoubtedly reduce the number of global jobs that will be available. It will also allow companies to produce their products and services at far lower costs than before. A wise government would find a way to tax this additional revenue and use the income to create a form of a UBI. If not, we will have orders of magnitude more homeless in a decade.\n\n&gt; wise government\n\nMaybe we could also ask the tooth fairy.\n\nI knew from the beginning AI's potential for good would be squandered and it would be mainly used by grifters and morons.\n\nWe've been through this before. NFTs were originally supposed to be a way to help online artists. To prove who created or owned a piece, to facilitate the buying and selling of digital art. It was supposed to be a good thing.\n\nLook what happened to those hopes and dreams.\n\nWhatever genuine benefits AI could bring, I don't care. The whole culture is already poisoned by greed and corruption. Fuck all of it.\n\nThis game is just asset flipping with extra steps!\n\nI don't know, I think AI as a tool in human hands could enable larger scale games by removing tedious work load. Have it generate and populate large worlds and landscapes in an exploration have, for insurance, then go over that landscape and fine tune it. It's a LOT easier to build off the base idea than it is to generate an entire map from scratch, and the time saved not generating the entire map yourself can go into spending more time enriching the areas and story. \n\nBut trying to rely on the AI to *be creative for you* is doomed to fail from the start\n\nCompanies will always prioritize profit maximization over creative freedom and quality.\n\nThe product is not important, in fact the product isn't even the product anymore, the consumer is the product. The workers create the bait (game), the company catches the consumer (product), and the consumer's money is extracted and given to executives and shareholders. They do not care at all about the quality of the bait as long as it catches some fish.\n\nHow much you want to bet AI was used to shovel out those palette-swapped \"legendary\" reskins they want you to pay full price for a flipped RGB value.\n\nThey can already do that.\n\nIt's almost like the goal of every corporation is to increase production and decrease costs.\n\nAnd that the largest cost is labor and is always always always the thing they want to cut the most.\n\nAnd then the CEO cashes out before the \"eternal growth\" scheme eventually collapses, along with the entire company.\n\nWhich I find very interesting, because there have to be people with disposable income to buy the products those corporations make. So someone has to pay these people, or everybody goes out of business.\n\n\"Never mind all that! We'll worry about that NEXT quarter!\"\n\nSince the games will be made faster and cheaper by computers, they’re gonna cost less….. right?\n\nI mean what did you expect. Cutting labor cost is the whole reason AI is getting developed. And no random internet circlejerks will not stop it. Economic incentive always will win, thinking anything else is utterly detached from reality.\n\nReally makes me wonder who will be buying stuff when so many people are out of high paying jobs\n\nEventually every market will just cater to 3 or 4 members of the Saudi royal family who are incels for consensual sex.\n\nI think I remember hearing a story on reddit from one of the mobile game dev said their game is kept floating by a Saudi leviathan. Like every new content is just targeted for that guy.\n\nOh he like soccer and these teams? Soccer skins + team colors and locked them behind some giga low rate loot box and watch the money floods in.\n\nSaudis have no problem spending tons of $ on gaming. \n\nA YouTuber I followed told a story about how he spun up a custom Minecraft server with mods that was pay to play. It got to the point where he could charge huge amounts of money and only 30 or so players were still paying, almost all from Saudi Arabia based on their IP. \n\nIt's the old \"sell 1 thing for 10 dollars instead of 10 things for 1 dollar\" business model.\n\n&gt; Saudis have no problem spending tons of $ on gaming. \n\nIDK if he was Saudi, but motar2k was notorious in the CSGO community for dropping massive donations to the players he liked. $10000, to multiple streamers massive. Apparently gaming is huge in the ME\n\nGaming's big in ME for the same reason it's big in Scandinavia/Iceland. What are you going to do if outside climate is so inhospitable for such long times?\n\nThere's a literal saudi prince who whales in dota 2 as well.\n\nYup, was about to comment that I'm pretty sure we wouldn't have gotten the dota anime without him, from what I remember reading he just straight up said he wanted it and would pay LOL.\n\nThe business model has certainly always worked for the fancy restaurant industry\n\nThat must be nice, making game for one guy and making a lot of money from it. Where do I sign in?\n\nUp my ass and to the left\n\nYou like it that way, dontcha?\n\nYes, daddy\n\nDidnt expect to get this far, what now?\n\nTry to the right?\n\n[deleted]\n\nThere was a study done and this phenomenon has a name, but it escapes me at the moment.  Basically, goods will be sold only to the wealthy in the future and the poor groups will not contribute much to the consumer side of the economy.\n\nThat’s how Europe wound up in the dark ages.\n\nExplain\n\nthey are called Whales I think.\n\nIsn't that Saudi guy a streamer of sorts? IIRC there's some guy in the middle east who streams just hours of him opening lootboxes (not actually playing the game). I think i saw him do a CSGO one where he dropped like $50,000 on lootboxes.\n\nDamn. Not sure if it is CSGO. The dev didn't say the name of their game.\n\nIn the words of Charlie Kelly \"You gotta spend money to make money, economics 101 dude.\"\n\nThat makes so much fucking sense.\n\nWoah woah woah. They don’t care if it’s consensual!\n\n&gt; who are incels for consensual sex\n\nSo incel lost all meaning.\n\nIncel hasn't actually meant involuntary celibate in years honestly\n\nlol did you say Saudi royal family, incels and consensual sex in the same sentence?! This doesn’t add up.\n\n\"incels for consenual sex\"\n\n\nReddit moment\n\nYeah, but we can't change the system. What if I'M one of those members of the saudi royal family one day\n\nI mean there are some jobs that wont be able to be replaced. The people programming the ai, construction, teachers, etc\n\nIt does suck for the people who spent their whole life building a career in jobs like graphic design or voice acting tho\n\nLike the pandemic showed, doing an essential job does not mean you're going to be paid or treated well.\n\nThats a chance with a any job ever, Teachers have already been getting paid and treated like shit since forever\n\nTeachers need taxes to get paid. If fewer people are able to work, and will be required to work - if high-level intellectual work is taken over by the AI - why would society spend all that money on teaching people?   \nMight just end up with AI engineers and prompt engineers having their offspring inherit their jobs, like in the medieval times.\n\nOptimistic to think the AI won't take over the AI engineering jobs or prompt engineering jobs tbh.\n\nThose jobs will be able to be replaced in the future though.\n\n&gt;The people programming the ai,\n\nThe one guy putting in the prompts?\n\nAlso, I HATE when people say there are \"some jobs that wont be able to be replaced\" like, ok, yeah...but who's going to pay for construction workers when every other job is replaced with AI? Is everyone going to work construction?\n\nI think they meant the people developing the AI.\n\nI've been wondering this for a while, who buys anything once we are all poor?\n\nUniversal basic income is the only sane answer. Assuming that AI really does deliver the anticipated disruption (big assumption), there's going to be a whole swathe of society that are basically unemployable. We need to be having this conversation now, but the usual suspects on the right start yelling about socialism whenever it's raised.\n\nA system where your basic needs are paid (rent, insurance, transportation, basic groceries), and people work to earn money for luxury, with plenty of room to decide just how much work is fitting for you, would be ideal. It gives you a positive incentive (not 'I *have* to work or I can't pay my rent this month' but 'I *want* to work so I can go on a holiday trip next summer' or whatever).\n\nOf course, such a system would require a lot of money, which means a significant amount of increased taxes on businesses. In other words, the corporate elite would be shouldering the burden. And they're not going to let that happen.\n\nThe top ten richest people in the world could distribute 3/4's their wealth to every other living person on the planet equally and STILL BE THE TOP TEN RICHEST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD.\n\nThat's too much money for any one person to have.  We can create utopia TODAY but the rich want to be rich and keep the poor poor.\n\nLol it's never going to happen, that's why they created debt. The system is working fine when more than half of people are broke AF and they know that's only getting worse. they'll make you sell your future, your children, and the air your breath before they universally give anything back.\n\nGuillotines it is then, because I don't see an alternative if what you say is true.\n\n[deleted]\n\n&gt;It's not like before where the king had a huge castle and only so many soldiers to stop the people burning it down.\n\nWe still know where their castles are.\n\nThat still will result in a system where most people live with very little, now it just becomes harder to climb the ladder.\n\nYou think that's bad? \n\nMost people only view this as far as the labor of the company. \n\nWhat about the company itself? \n\nIf AI can get so powerful that cyber security companies no longer need all their employees, then that means AI is so good to no longer need multiple cyber security companies. Why buy from 100 companies if one can already do the job?\n\nLikely, the companies that can afford the infrastructure for an expensive AI will win, like Microsoft. Not only are employees being let go, entire waves of companies are just shutting down. \n\nSame can go for games. Why would Sony bother hiring various gaming companies when they can invest in AI that makes all the games they need?\n\nIronically, the very tool companies are using to replace you will be the tool that other companies use to replace themselves.\n\nThe future really is starting to look like the Judge Dread one.\n\nThat’s tomorrow’s problem. Executives aren’t paid the big bucks to worry about tomorrow.\n\nBasically it's this.\n\n[https://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/2012-04-03](https://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/2012-04-03)\n\nMany companies and their investors are very short sighted in that regard\n\nThey are quite literally incapable of looking past the next quarter.\n\nThis is a very weird time to live in. People are being replaced by an AI, which is inherently a good thing (as in more free time and options for self realisations) for many reasons. However those people will have to do something to sustain themselves economically, but it will be increasingly harder to find a job.\n\nThis circle will have to break eventually, because more people you replace, more people will rely on social support.\n\nAlso the more people you will replace, more will be unemployed and won't be able to afford to buy any of the stuff the AI will produce. So you have massive amount of easily produced products, but less and less people who can afford to buy it.\n\nThere will be some serious misery, until the circle breaks and corporation will realise they can't sustain this indefinitely.\n\nEDIT: This got a lot of attention and even though I appreciate all the opinions, I don't have time see all, so I am not replying anymore.\n\nI think you gotta see some movies where they show the high class of people live in a floating city while the sub class of people are living in the gutters below.\nBecause that's where we are heading.\n\nencouraging oil arrest dolls tap seed carpenter simplistic practice ring\n\nThe only reason they are on the ground is because technology hasn't advanced enough yet to where they can reasonably float above the masses, or construct giant towers that scrape the heavens. That is the ONLY reason.\n\nWell, there’s also not that much advantage (and many disadvantages) of having a literal floating city apart from being a visually striking metaphor for social stratification for storytelling purposes…\n\ndime work imagine deserve shrill upbeat humorous dinner placid sophisticated\n\nWalls are easier to scale vs gaining the ability of flight.\n\nThat's why we must learn carpentry and metalworking. Madame Guillotine must sing once more.\n\nRemember that movie Elysium? I've got a funny feeling that's what's gonna happen.\n\nmatt damon save us\n\nWe’re already there, we’re just too busy fighting culture wars while the elite extract wealth from our labors\n\nThe ultra-wealthy absolutely live in a different reality than the vast majority of us. \n\nI can't remember the last time I purchased a social media platform and changed the rules to facilitate extremism and sway public opinion. It's been a little while.\n\nYou ever watch Star Trek: Deep Space Nine?\n\nBell Riots are coming this year, we are just two months out!\n\nAmusingly enough, the districts mentioned in those episodes were based on real government ideas discussed during that period.\n\n…so it wasn’t completely fictional.  Smart men and women drew up plans in the halls of power.\n\nSpoiler; the corporations wont realise shit.  Profit maximisation is inherent to what a corporation is.\n\nThe only way effect change is political.\n\nWhen they start losing sales because the people laid off by other companies using AI they'll notice. Workers are also consumers, you can't make profit if no one is buying. Of course, that's *WAY* off in the future.\n\nYeah and people also said corporations would notice when mass extinctions and climate shifts started happening.  But they haven't and they don't because the tragedy of the commons is exactly that.\n\nyeah, they won't notice shit - they're just all racing to squeeze as much wealth out of the rest of us before companies start to collapse\n\nCorporations are just groups of people, so if they don't notice changes where they live they just won't notice.\n\nBut sales being down would absolutely change the behavior of businesses since profit maximization is the point. If there's no profit, they have to change *something*. That *something* won't be \"the morally correct thing\" so much as \"whatever generates profit now\". But, I don't think people (especially those executives currently firing people) understand how expensive and narrow AI still is and how expensive these decisions will be in a few years.\n\nNo, when sales go down, you don't change the strategy, you just fire more people. I've lived through a dozen waves of layoffs over my career in tech. The board demands profit, and it's easier to cut than to grow. So you cut. Then, next quarter, numbers are still not growing, so you cut more. Now the product is significantly worse, so sales are worse than ever, so you have to cut even deeper. \n\nEventually, the company is no longer sustainable, so leadership starts eating itself, the board votes to sell the company, everyone gets laid off, the execs and shareholders walk away with millions, and repeat the same thing at the next company on the list.\n\nYes, I'm sure this time will be the time the world industry decides not to replace workers with technology, unlike all the other times.\n\nWed already be out of human cashier jobs if they could come up with a way to stop everyone stealing from the self check out\n\nWhich would suck because retail customer service is like 90% of lower and middle class jobs\n\nWhen I shop in the morning, there are 0 cashiers. Just 1 employee helping out with 8 self-checkouts.\n\nWe've basically been there for a while. We aren't spending 700 billion on defense for fun. It's the UBI we wanted with extreme government shackling we didn't. How many people went into the Army that you know because it was they're only possible chance? \n\nI mean culture can shift the direction of the world of economics a little bit, but yeah, businesses are designed to make money, so they're gonna do just that.\n\nPeople who want to buy the next Call of Duty won't care. \n\nActivision Blizzard is already too big. It's like trying to boycott Disney. Will never work. The only thing that works is legislation but are they doing anything illegal? Copyright laws are not equipped to deal with this.\n\nAI generated artwork are getting harder to be recognise on first glance. People could use AI tools to create small logos or decals and you wont even know it.\n\nI used to be pretty good at spotting AI art. I'll admit I've been wrong a lot more often lately. It's getting really good.\n\nLike how you don't notice good cgi in movies because it's good, similarly you don't notice good AI generated 'art'. Initially it was a combination of AI not being good and people who actually had no clue about art using ai gen tools and claiming themselves to be artists. These low quality outputs flooded the internet because of how fast you could make them. For a moment it seemed like these \"artists\" were identifying themselves as some sort of discriminated bunch hated on by the evil artist overlords when in reality they had no clue what art is and thinking clicking 'generate' puts them on the same level as traditional artists.  In the hands of actual artists ai tools have sped up their workflow. They know what is wrong with an initial ai generated image to correct it and/or bring it towards their vision. But in the hands of a novice, they just think whatever AI spits out is a good final product.\n\nPeople complaining about AI artwork don’t realize it’s been an aspect of photoshop for years. AI tools in photoshop have been around for a long time.\n\nGenerating the entire image was the new thing.\n\nWell that’s still a drastic difference\n\nLmao sometimes I have imposter syndrome drawing on Procreate and using the hold technique to snap lines straight. Then I realize that even sign painters use an aid to get their letters straight. \n\nThere is a GRAND CANYON OF A DIFFERENCE between using tools to aid our creations and to use a tool that creates something *with zero user input or know-how.*\n\nEspecially if a human does some afterwork, I think it's super hard to notice.\n\nIt was always going down this road. People keep laughing at weird hands as if that’s not a technological hurdle that will inevitably be overcome.\n\nI mean AI art can be used as a template for an artist to polish it (and add new hands lol), cuts back on a ton of work, looks even better, and still is AI art IMO lol. It's gonna be harder to spot and call out especially when people start massively editing them instead of just generating and calling it a day!\n\nOne of the battlepasses they released featured an obvious AI generated loading screen you could unlock where one of the guys legs in it is twisted in an un natural position.\n\nOne of the things that make it tough to identify AI art with certainly is that the sorts of things that AI struggles with are the same sorts of things that humans struggle with. Drawing people with realistic anatomy in natural poses is hard.\n\n\nhttps://www.google.com/search?q=rob+liefeld+art\n\nI'd argue Rob's work is an assumed style, not incompetence in drawing human proportions.\n\nI’d argue this is what AI is best for - filler art\n\nSmall, unimportant, minor assets which a player will see but not actually look at closely or pay attention to\n\nThe problem is those minor assets were given to junior artists as a way for them to upskill in the profession. Yes AI can do those assets quicker and cheaper but if the business chooses this route over junior artists in a few years they'll be less people to replace the senior artists.\n\nThe skill gap is going to get bigger and companies will be trying to hire people with 10+ years of industry experience and trying to figure out why there aren't enough people.\n\nEdit: As a note this is already happening in the UK games industry and increased reliance on AI will only grow the issue\n\nhttps://www.gamesindustry.biz/how-can-the-uk-games-industry-solve-its-skills-shortage\n\nThis is something we are realizing in Tech as well. If you give all of the junior dev jobs to ai, we will quickly run out of senior devs. A lot of these jobs people are trying to replace for ai are learning/stepping stones for a human to gain the skill needed to perform at a higher level. Ai will never get better in a way that allows it to do senior level work simply by doing junior level work. That's an advantage humans have over machines right now - we are far better at transferring skills we learn.\n\nA big catch 22 with jobs is that they want people with experience and know how so they can minimize/avoid training. All the while they are dismissive of formal training if it lacks real world experience. That shitty problem is only going to get exponentially worse.\n\nAgility will solve this! The product owner &amp; product manager can just task the new devs to fo the thing! /s\n\nI do think this is a genuine problem that is going to arise over the coming decades. \n\nI wonder how industries will overcome it?\n\nWell, currently a lot of industries like machining where I live have been expecting people to just show up with years of experience, education in the field, knowledge on the machines and how to use them safely, and get irritated when someone without skill or needing to learn shows up to an interview while they market that they'll teach you.\n\n\nThe pay for the older guys keeps increasing to cling onto them and try and keep them working instead of retiring while not offering anywhere near the same pay or benefits that the old guys started with for newer people.\n\n\nAnd then the companies eventually collapse or outsource it overseas since there's no-one educated in the area to do the work once the older guys actually retire.\n\n\nI picture it kinda like that, but with tech and white collar jobs instead.\n\nYeah this is what I expect too, short term gains for businesses/shareholders with long term impacts that won't be seen until the current generations are retiring.\n\nMy dad is one of those older guys. Only person in the factory that knows how all the machines work completely. Only one with knowledge of all the weird quirks of each machine. A MAJOR brand owns this factory for one of their products. He retires in like 2 months. They are completely and totaled fucked. He attempted to train up newbies, but they run their employee's so damn ragged they end up quitting because Wendy's pays the same for 80% less workload.\n\nThe world is going to come to a full stop in 10 years if these companies don't figure their bullshit out already.\n\nI think the lazy/cheap companies will just increase their reliance on AI as it progresses using it for major assets and quality will degrade as they begin trying to build games with less staff and more prompt generated models/code.\n\nBetter companies will swing back to apprenticeships but that only works if they have the remaining staff to train new starters.\n\nIf you're familiar with \"no take only throw\", the result is that the ball stops getting thrown.  In other words, wide-spread shortage of qualified talent.  Given how much we rely on competent programmers to keep our rube goldberg-esque network running, I don't give it good odds.  Then again, the internet sucks now, largely because of the same AI that is also threatening entry level jobs, so maybe it'll be fine for it to just die.\n\nFor now\n\nIf anything AI art is getting easier to recognize. Newer models are less and less unique. You can see that across all major AI models, past version would generate quite unique results based on provided input. Not it's all smoothed out, weirdly detailed stuff.\n\nI know the state of AI in video games, I'm currently working on a game for Square Enix Japan.\n\nThis article is misleading, go figure. The skin wasn't an \"AI skin\". AI is not at the level where it can generate an entire AAA quality custom 3d character model and provide seamless texture maps, then rig it with no input. That's a pretty big insult to the modeller, surfacing artist and rigger that probably spent weeks working on the character. \nFurthermore the article goes on to blame AI for the job losses in the game industry recently, which is also false. \nThe current slump in the games (and animation industry as a whole) is partially AI related in some departments, but is mostly caused by over hiring during COVID, ripples down the pipeline from the writers strike, and general worldwide inflation.\n\nEdited to clarify I'm talking about AAA quality.\n\nI mean the headline is the equivalent of me saying “I ate beyond meat last night, and yes I did throw up this morning” while leaving out the fact that I also drank 15 beers and had the stomach flu at the same time.\n\nYeah it's a terrible headline that barely regurgitates the original article correctly. There was a 2D loading screen they sold as part of a package that looked like AI art\n\nsupersizeme moment\n\nPeople always talk about the elderly sharing blatantly fake information on Facebook but Reddit has so much misinformation like this. A half-truth buried under several layers of lies posted by someone desperate to push their agenda.\n\nAnd most people aren't going to read this correction, they've already taken the title as a fact and are going to readjust their worldview based on it.\n\nYeah. If it's something reddit has strong feelings on, people here will become just as aggressively disinterested in the actual facts as anyone else.\n\nYep, people are misunderstanding the difference between \"Was created by AI\" and \"Pieces of these were made with the assistance of AI.\"\n\nThe latter now being a regular practice, which you also being in the industry, must be keenly aware of.\n\nPrecisely. And since its the concepts that are AI and not the 3D assets themselves, the skin you actually see in game is 0% AI. Its just a clickbait way to word it by saying \"the skin was made by AI\"\n\nUsing generative AI was not a regular practice in the industry, especially for art assets, what are you in about? This is a recent development.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint AI upscaling, noise-removal, etc. which has been part of Photoshop et al. for years work the same way as \"generative AI\", often with the same datasets and models. Do not mistake your lack of knowledge of what goes under the hood for reality.\n\nThey need to use AI to optimize games so they work better, not spew out crap like this.\n\nsurely major stores like steam psn etc will disclose that this mega game uses AI like they require of small indoe games\n\nlol\n\nSteam allows the use of AI, there are just a few caveats that exclude the worst offenders. Don't get me wrong I really dislike AI \"art\" but steam hasn't fully banned it. https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4145017/view/3862463747997849618\n\n[deleted]\n\nMisread it. Thank you for correcting me\n\nThere's something funny about tech companies being obsessed with innovation, then going all in on AI, a technology that, by its very nature, can only iterate on what has already existed.\n\n\nI give it a year before their meetings start and end with \"Why aren't we innovating anymore?\"\n\n\nAI can't creat smart art direction. It can follow trends, but when everything being made is done with AI, new trends stop happening. You need human brains to make new, and 'interesting' usually requires 'new.'\n\n\nCompanies that tilt too hard toward AI are going to fall directly into stagnation.\n\nAs someone who's job could be heavily automated if not completely replaced by AI once it stops hallucinating so much this is scary as shit, but at the same time I simply do not think it can be stopped. The cat is out of the bag and there is very little that can be done to put it back in.\n\nIf you think your career is at risk over the next 5-10 years then you gotta start trying to upskill or move horizontally to not get left behind.\n\nIt's not just you, people who think their jobs won't be replaced will join the rest of us in reality within a decade or two. There is no upskilling that will save any job in the long run, hopefully society will move towards working on passion projects with necessities covered when all the menial jobs are no longer needed, the question really is just how bad things will get before the current system (that was not even remotely designed for this whatsoever) breaks.\n\nThat's how I see it, it's just a question of when. The consequences will be felt sooner than people imagine even with rudimentary AI.\n\nThe tech and rationalist sphere are mostly fixated on doomsday scenarios e.g. possible exploitation for war and apocalypse, but I think jobs and the structure of the new economy is worth as much concern. The way things are currently organized, we have a game of musical chairs, and when the music stops (i.e. AI takes over and the economy as we know it is forever changed), most of us are caught with our pants down, in more ways than one. We'll see some policy changes as an after-thought like negative tax / UBI, but productivity will still be rock-bottom, and sitting around passively consuming all day with chump change is neither good for society nor what society really wants. At the same time, there's not going to be much of a market for whatever artisan hand-made bullshit your neighbors will want to peddle. \n\nI think it will be important for regular people to have access to the capital and AI powers needed to work on cool stuff. I think it will be bad if this is behind a walled garden and people instead just have a no-strings stipend for a shitty room in an apartment, games, food and porn. Yes technically no one will \"have to work\", great, but it's naive to think society will be content to be artisans/artists or loaf around with no power to build things.\n\nIf you thought their games were half assed as is lol\n\nWhen we've all been replaced, how will we afford things made by AI?\n\nHow can you be a professional writer and think \"scolding hot\" is correct? Jesus.\n\nWhat’s that? Every tech company is using AI? You don’t say!\n\nIf warzone has an AI generated skin then don't they need to update their steam page with the AI generated content notice\n\nNot cool that people are losing jobs over it.\n\nBut will these companies pass the savings to the customers?\n\nSpoiler: No\n\n“As the Wired investigation notes, none of the developers who came forward were in favor of using generative AI. The push to use the technology almost always comes from the executive level, who sees cheaper costs and “good enough” art as acceptable.”\n\nThe issue isn't the use of AI in video games—it has incredible potential. The problem is its use for monetization. Generative AI is typically aimed at reducing or replacing human labor. While it could theoretically free up developers to focus on enhancing games, in most cases, it will likely be used to minimize labor costs, replacing human workers to save money.\n\nMakes sense why Microsoft studios are unionizing.\n\nThe whole point of AI is for humans to work less. That would be the dream, but in reality corporations will use it to keep us poor and in-line.\n\nCompanies are not charities.  If they can get by without you, they will.  It doesn't matter what you did for them before or how hard you worked or how loyal you are.  You are gone if you are not needed.  Always save money.  Always keep your skills up so you are in demand.\n\n[removed]\n\nAI is supposed to make work easier, not make it obsolete\n\nCompletely unsurprising, I'm very much not an artist but I can ask AI prompters to generate art for me and in a lot of cases it seems quite good or passable.  And that's just going to keep getting better.\n\nWhat I really want to see in games are AI chatbot NPC's that talk conversationally.\n\nAnd where games AI learns from the millions of games being played on it to get better instead of just relying on cheats like more resources or knowing where the player is.\n\n&gt; And where games AI learns from the millions of games being played on it to get better instead of just relying on cheats like more resources or knowing where the player is.\n\n\nThis makes me think that cheaters using AI is gonna happen sooner or later D:\n\nIt already has depending on the game.\n\n&gt; What I really want to see in games are AI chatbot NPC's that talk conversationally.\n\nThere's actually a buckwild Skyrim mod that does exactly this.\n\nYou pair the full-VR mod with the ChatGPT-fueled NPC dialogue mod, and you can straight-up walk through Skyrim having casual conversations with NPCs.\n\nIt isn't *perfect* (you can ask a barkeep to solve complex mathematical equations), but it is a really dope prototype for what we can expect in the future.\n\n&gt;What I really want to see in games are AI chatbot NPC's that talk conversationally.\n\nI keep reading this but wonder what the benefit would be. It is also not that easy to get it going. \n\n1. Massive hardware power required. Llama 3.1 needs 128GB!(!) of RAM to run locally for example. And if it is processed via servers, then once they shut down, all NPCs are quiet forever and the game is unplayable. \n\n2. If the NPC is quest related, you risk the NPC to fail to do it's job since they can go off-rails or it doesn't say the information it should in a critical moment. \nFor generic NPCs, they might seem more lifelike in chats, but in the end just talk useless information since they are not important or say the same thing but with slightly different wording.\n\nNice day for fishing, ain't it?\n\nAI can already replace the CEO. Just making that change will save 100s of millions.\n\nThey are also using AI voices.. voice actors just went on strike for it. 1900 jobs gone. Decrease costs by ending human roles in video game development is not the way.\n\nso thats why in german the \"back\" as in a go back to last screen button was translated to \"rücken\", as in the back of the body\n\nFuck that company. They banned my 8 year old paid overwatch 1 account for \"cheating\" except I never cheated. Of course they are too cheap to have customer support so when I put in tickets I just get pre-canned automated responses. Trash company. Do not spend a penny on them. If I was actually a cheater I would just make a new account for free and keep playing, but I'm not, so screw them.\n\nThe article does not say skin it says cosmetic, while also talking about AI mostly doing 2D work. So most likely the calling card was ai generated. \n\nThis could go a number of ways.\n\nAI is great at doing grunt work that is largely redundant for people, yet it's pretty terrible at creative work.\n\nA good comparison is how a talented curated level designer is vastly superior to an algorithm making levels in a Roguelike, right?\n\nI could see it replacing doing texture work, trees (think Speedtree but fully automated), help automate topography, develop better enemy AI, and other cost and time saving measures.\n\nLarge companies will obviously use this to reduce labor costs first and foremost, however, small teams could also utilize this so that a team of 10 could potentially do the work traditionally required by a team of 50. It could be a huge boon for indie and small developers.\n\nOnly time will tell, I suppose.\n\nYeah ever since Activision bought Blizzard, it was never the same....\n\nI mean, they are shooting themselves in the foot. People will know, they won’t buy it, then more layoffs will occur. And it’s an endless cycle where people won’t have money to buy things and then the economy crashes.\n\nCompanies are so stupid sometimes.\n\nWell, we just crossed the event horizon of the downward spiral into having nothing more than AI generated shit for games.\n\nWhat's an AI skin? Like a texture generated by AI?\n\nIt means they're using AI to make 2d art to base their work off of. An artist would take a generation that is ideal, touch it up or use it as reference. Then pass it down the process. It's not an entire skin made by an AI, it's just the beginning process."

I still remember the excitement of playing a 'true' 3d game for the first time. \n\nIt holds up so well that my kids play it now lol.\n\nThe craziest thing is that Mario 64 still plays smooth as the motherfucker. Now that's game design\n\nDragon age inquisition was 10 years ago\n\n[removed]\n\nI remember playing GTAV freshman year of highschool. Now I’m 5ish years into a career after university. WHAT THE FUCK\n\nGames are now decade-long projects. It fuckin sucks.\n\nI’m a star citizen backer, trust me I know.\n\nEdit: I’ve still had a ton of fun and made lifelong friends in the game. Check out r/starcitizen if you haven’t in a while. Personally I feel as if the popular “scam” quips about the game do not hold up anymore.\n\nFunny way of saying “I got scammed”\n\nWhile i partly feel this way too, i got my $45 worth. I got around 60 hours out of exploring, blowing myself up and just messing around. \n\nStill sucks to check in every few years and its only gotten like 10 ships and one new area.\n\nAnd still just a series of vertical slices as well.\n\nOof\n\nAh, Chris Roberts... even when you'd pay the infamous nigerian prince from the spam mails, your chances to get something in return are much higher\n\nBe honest though, how many ships did you buy?   \nHow much money did you throw at them?\n\nThat was Vice City for me as a high school freshman\n\nI remember when GTAV was considered the best game ever made. Now its feels mediocre and I think IV has the best vibes.\n\nI think GTA 5 still holds up to this day. It's just that it's been relevant for so long that you and other people are tired of it and I don't blame you.\n\nTW3 still beats many AAA titles today for graphics.\n\nAnd story and acting…\n\nAbsolutely\n\nWinds howling\n\nFor graphics? I think that's nostalgia, but absolutely for gameplay and the graphics do still hold up well\n\nThe OG Skyrim is almost 13 years old, what the heck.\n\nSkyrim looks its age, lmao\n\neven when it came out\n\nThat actually doesn’t seem *TOO* far fetched to me. But the fact that I was 16 when it came out, and will be 30 next year before we got an Elder scrolls 6 blows my mind.\n\nIn my mind, final fantasy vii is a decade old game, not fucking witcher 3  🥲\n\nThe remake is closer to a decade. The og is nearly 3 decades old\n\nThe original PlayStation console turns 30 this year.\n\nHence the 30th anniversary cashgrab.\n\nThe Spanish Inquisition started 545 years ago, and dispanded 189 years ago. I bet that makes you feel old\n\nNobody suspects the Spanish Inquisition!\n\nWow, has it only been 189 years? I didn't expect that.\n\nLmao what\nThat can't be true, it feels like origins is that old, ot Inquisition :(\n\nMy mind is still stuck in like 2018 or so so games from the 2015 - 2018 period are still \"recent\" to me.\n\nI can't believe Hitman Season One came out 8 years ago. That's the one realization that made me feel old as fuck.\n\n2017 was 7 years ago.\n\nI'm in a weird mix. Some things from 2015-2018 feel recent, while others feel old. Like GOW 2018 and Fallout 76 still feels recent, while Fallout 4 and Halo 5 feels so old\n\nCOVID 100% warped our sense of time. The past 4 years feel like it's only be 2.\n\nI hate that I remember people talking about it in lobby of OW.

Fucking hell...\n\nOh man I loved that game!!\n\nDoes it not feel like it's been a decade to you? Idk, maybe it's me, but the Covid lockdowns are like this barrier in my brain where everything before them feels like 10+ years ago and everything after them feels like last week\n\nI remember when a colleague forwarded me the teaser trailer, it was 2009 or 2010. I feel very old now. Those were the times of Little Big Planet and Uncharted 2 on PS3. So old.\n\nI think it was 2013:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/aCgWabJssVI?si=WkSE1eFV-nghBijR\n\nI remember the drama.\n\nThe civil war in the no man's sky sub was peak reddit drama.\n\nNo Mans Sky has in indeed come a long way in 10 years - I still remember the days when the path for this game looked grim and bleak\n\n[removed]\n\nThat shit is hilarious but 85K views in 8 years isn't exactly taking anything by storm \n\nIt's been re-uploaded by different users, most likely\n\nYeah, I probably seen it 85k times myself alone.\n\nYeah, it's been 10 years, so the original probably came out on NewGrounds.  Remember that flash websites guys??  That was only 10 years ago right guys?!?!??!?!\n\nI saw a video on Youtube recently that said it was uploaded 19 years ago and I chuckled to myself at what must be an obvious glitch.  Then realization set in.\n\nBut that would be legit one of the earliest videos uploaded on YouTube, since it's 19 years old this year.  Not \"19 years since Google bought it\" or \"19 years since it got famous.\"  Just 19 years old total.\n\nI mean, shoot, if you want to feel old, just think about Geocities (especially pre-popup ads), or Yahoo! when it was not only relevant but *the* site to use, or Ask Jeeves, or mailing lists, Netscape vs. Internet Explorer, or if you just want to feel the grip of death closing in on you, think about Usenet and MUDs, or even just Sierra Online.\n\nActual original video with 2.9m views (you can search up no man's sky Jurassic Park to see another report with 228k views): https://youtu.be/RvAwB7ogkik\n\nYou looked at the view count but not the description?\n\n&gt;Another stolen maymay.\n\n[Another one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXGUOWMNxqc) has the description \n\n&gt;This appeared on Reddit and we found it amusing so thought we'd add it so it doesn't get lost. Credit to the original creator of this. It made us smile.\n\n\"Credit to the original creator.\" - Person who doesn't credit the original creator.\n\nThat video had way more views. Everyone in the gaming community had seen it.\n\nEspecially when a quarter of the views are me alone.\n\nI knew what it was before clicking it, still love it after all these years.\n\nDont time fly by :)\n\nDude I came back to the game a couple weeks ago after 3ish years away and I  could’ve shed a tear of joy when I realized I could breakdown ships for parts to make my own now never mind all the other added features and what appears to be a total redesign of the space station interiors too!!\n\nYeah.  It's still the same game though.  \n\nI mean that little alien sitting on the chair sure looks different but functions exactly the same.\n\nThey added a lot of visual improvements, gimmicks, and chores.  But it's still the same game of shooting lasers at rocks, and looking at procedurally generated things move around in circles.\n\nI'm not attacking the game, whoever enjoys it's vibe - that's great.  But it's not a different game than it was.  They just added more ornaments and busywork.\n\nThe factorio levels of bullshit for crafting drove me absolutely nuts.\n\nAnd still did with each subsequent update.\n\nCreative mode just feels like playing a game that clearly was not meant for that type of mode cause damn does it make the game's flaws stick out badly.\n\nSometimes I wonder if the game could even have existed without \"the lies\". It took years past the release date to redeem the game. Would someone have wanted to finance the development for that long, from this small studio... possibly years without even announcing the game... I don't know.\n\nAs someone who's followed the game since day 1, I'd wager it would have been seen as a mild disappointment but otherwise would have been fine with another year of development. It seemed like Sony wasn't interested in financing another year, though. \n\n\nOne year after release, the game had updated multiple times to improve graphics and add a myriad of missing features like multiplayer, ship classes, and a complete quest system plus some extras like base building ground vehicles, a few universe resets to improve terrain generation, and freighter ownership. That said, it's likely that they were able to add those features only from sales from release. \n\nIt needed way more than a year to get even 10% of the promised feature that the lead was going around saying we're in the game already in every interview.\n\nPutting it on Sony not wanting to finance it is like blaming Sega for the state of Aliens colonial marines.\n\nAt least it turned into a playable game and not Star Citizen.\n\nThis, between hello games and cdpr i dont know who told the most bs\n\nSurprised the game maintained an audience. I usually forgot about a game and move on unless it's something spectacular.\n\nDespite the flaws even the launch version had some massive fans like myself and a bunch of people at /r/NoMansHigh\n\nBro lost his tablet and looks at you like \"you see this shit?\"\n\nNah, it's been almost a decade. My bro frog guy upgraded his tablet to augmented reality contacts. His chair is a proper gamer chair now too and even the base looks much more stable.\n\n&gt; proper gamer chair\n\nAs in, absolute garbage for anything resembling an ergonomic posture?\n\nThey’re Gek.  That’s a proper chair to meet their ergonomic needs.\n\nI was looking at it on the store last week thinking,  \"it's only been out a few years, is it too late to get into it?\"\n\nEdit: looks like I will have to download it tonight then. Cheers for the response!\n\nNever too late\n\njust make sure you dont get into it too early\n\nThat’s what she said\n\nAnother blast from the past.\n\nI don’t know. It’s incredibly overwhelming as a new player. I tried for a couple hours but there’s truly a fuck ton of content to wrap your head around.\n\nI was told to just follow the storyline, and that was solid advice. Do a mission, learn about a mechanic, spend a bit of time faffing around with that mechanic, do another mission, learn another mechanic, etc, etc.\n\nHaven't played for a couple years but this is the way\n\nYou'll just come across things where it's intuitive to learn more about its function then you explore that realm of the game. \n\nThen after hours go oh yea there's a story. Rinse repeat.\n\nJaw drop in awe at what theyve achieved.\n\nI got into it around a month ago and have been having a blast\n\nMan every time I reinstall I end up uninstalling again, I don't know how to enjoy it, I think I'm playing it wrong\n\nIt's probably just not your thing. If you can't find a way to enjoy iy let it go. I have done the same with a lot of games that are \"top 10 all time\" games like RDR2 and BOTW. They just don't click for me.\n\nI was so sad when I realized I didn't care for GTA. At least i got it on sale.\n\nGTAV I got free on Epic so I eventually played it, now waiting for RDR2 to go free\n\nRDR2 was free on the PS store\n\nAs someone who loved playing through GTAV's story years back I really didn't like RDR2.\n\nEvery action is just painfully slow and repetitive. I like other aspects of the game but looting and interacting with object is just so mind numbingly annoying.\n\nI remember hearing such good things about Hollow Knight. Bought it, played it, then I realized wait a minute... I don't like this type of game at all. Not all games are equally good for all tastes, and that's just fine.\n\nBotw took so long to click for me, think it was my 3rd attempt to play it  I just decided to ignore the exploration side of things until i got my bearings. \n\nRDR2 though I could never get into, despite the first being one of my favourite games.\n\n&gt; If you can't find a way to enjoy iy let it go.\n\nThis is the reason I've never pulled the trigger on it and tried it, even though it's been on sale a bunch of times. When I ask myself the question, \"Why will this game be fun for me?\", I can't think of an answer.\n\nI feel that. RDR2 is in all of my friends’ top 3 lists, but I hated it. RDR was something else entirely, though. That game holds a fond place in my heart\n\nLol same, game so boring for me, but nms i play the heck of it. Kinda weird\n\nThat's me too, I don't know how to enjoy it but I really respect the game regardless\n\nIt is very sandbox, even with the quest chains it has. If you want to try something a little more structured, try an expedition. I think the current one is still live for four more weeks, and is largely revolving around fishing.\n\nExpeditions are pretty similar - find/repair your ship, head to space, find specific locations. Each phase has 8 steps, each step rewarding you with items you'll usually need for further steps. Then each phase (there are five) rewards you with cosmetics usually, though the previous expedition unlocked upgraded to a craft. Some steps are super easy (go to space), while some will take exploration (find a mountain of X height). But people will build bases around important locations to help other Travelers find their way.\n\nNa it's not to late. You can tell the devs love the game and they continuously release new major content updates for it every few months. The universe is large enough to never see another player (outside of the hub area) or their base structures, unless you want to\n\n100% worth a go, it's amazing how much it has improved. I got bored after about 50 hours but that's about 49 hours more than any other recent game has held me for.\n\nits not too late, there are still a few planets never been visited by a player\n\n&gt;a few planets never been visited\n\nIf by 'a few', you mean above 99.99%, and by 'never been visited' you mean never *will* be visited, then you are correct!\n\nNo Man's Sky has an incomprehensibly large number of planets. Its getting massive, free updates all the time. Never to late to start, OP!\n\nI don't really understand, do all of these places have unique content? Is it done via algorithm or something? I feel like the servers must be absolutely massive but I also don't understand game design generally either...\n\nIt is done by procedural generation. Everything from ~~solar~~ star systems, planets, spaceships, weather systems, flora, and fauna. So it can be unique combinations of parts depending on the seed. There aren't any servers like an MMO, but there is a shared social space known as the Nexus that can have up to 16 random players. \n\nEach player has their own instance of the galaxy, and can see other players on planets if that option is set, but last I played you can't interact with them.\n\nFun space fact. There's no such thing as \"Solar systems\" in a plural sense. There is only one Solar system, ours, because it is named after our sun, Sol.\n\nTechnically other systems are called \"star systems\".\n\nPraise Sol!\n\nThat is a fun fact. Thank you.\n\n*Most* planets have a baseline of similar content, like normal outposts, having some form of \"trees\" and \"animals\". The content differs on stuff like what combination of resources are available on the planet, if there are enemies, what the terrain/fauna/flora looks like, what weather is present, what environmental hazards are there, some solar system modifiers for economy. Yeah, you'll encounter reused assets of course, especially a certain flora lmao, but even after 200 hours (obviously not all that time spent looking through every planet I find) I still see planets/environments that make me go wow...\n\nI was gonna say. Didn't they calculate it would take a few hundred trillion years to visit every single star in it? Just visit, not stay.\n\nJust bought it a few days ago myself, and I'm really enjoying it so far. It's never too late to get into it\n\nIt’s a great game tbh. If you have VR it’s probably the coolest VR experience out of any game in the category\n\nNMS might be the most shining example of persistence in gaming industry\n\nAnd also the game large studios point to when they release their games half-baked with \"We'll fix it in 3 years. We promise.\"\n\nRemember the planet from the demo was coded into the game and wasn't randomized at all. False advertising at its finest. But somehow this one got away with that. Would they have bothered fixing it if it didn't get the reaction it did? They weren't sorry they did it or else it never would have released in the state it did.\n\n&gt; Would they have bothered fixing it if it didn't get the reaction it did\n\n\nThey said well prior to release that they'd keep updating for the rest of their lives if they could, which has been pretty well proven out by the *eight years of free content updates.* If they just kept at it to get it in a working state then they probably would have called it good long ago.\n\n\n&gt; They weren't sorry they did it or else it never would have released in the state it did. \n\n\nThey delayed the game multiple times to try to get it in as good a shape as possible. At some point you either a) release, b) run out of funds, or c) get sued into the ground by your publisher for not delivering the product they asked for. \n\nIt's definitely perseverance, they held off the game for a long time, repeatedly. In the end they dropped it, and they brought it up to where it should've been. Still sad it didn't realize how it should've though. \n\nNo big company is gonna do that, no AAA comp. They spend so much money and then if it's not doing good enough on release, it's a flop, done and done. Gotta please shareholders or whatever I think.\n\nMore like shining example of repairing a major fuck-up.\n\nIf you told me Sean Murray was gonna go from scam artist to passionate guy who just got in way over his head in the public's eye I would have never believed you lol\n\nI honestly think he was just a game dev that needed PR training. The dude just couldn't say no or temper expectations. He was as hyped as he made everyone else which blew it all out of proportion.\n\nProblem being that the hype led to outright lying about certain features being in the game when they weren't. I enjoy how the game turned out but I really hope he got some public relations training for their next game.\n\nFF XIV too in a way\n\n[deleted]\n\nThat old character if you still have it has some unique 1.0 supporter glam then right? A scion tattoo and unique main story 'I was there yes' continuity dialogue options for some quests\n\nSame. Maxed out a few classes out of sheer stubbornness.\n\nWayfinder is also on this path and I hope they succeed as well as NMS did.\n\nNah, I think that title goes to Dwarf Fortress\n\n[removed]\n\nYeah this is very similar graphics just with different models and lighting… things have been _changed_ but not really significantly improved, from this image.\n\nOf course - NMS has been significantly improved in a lot of important ways - this image just doesn’t show it very well\n\nYeah if you really want to show off the improvements you got to show off the new planet tech, water/waves, volcanoes, firestorms, leviathans, etc.\n\nLEVIATHANS??!!??\n\nYeah there's space leviathans and dune style sand worms on planets it's pretty dope\n\nI actually thought this post was making fun of NMS for making no improvement.\n\nI was expecting a ~~more dramatic~~ difference\n\nHe's wearing darker clothes now.\n\nThus, No Man's Sky is the shining example of the greatest comeback in gaming.\n\nThis image doesn't tell us shit lol\n\nIt tells me the one on the right doesn't look any more realistic than the left, and my GPU fan is going to let me know it's busy until I put it in potato mode to look way worse than the left ever could.\n\nThis is my exact issue, I used to play NMS back when it came out.  Ran fine.  After all these updates I can't go two feet on potato mode without stuttering.\n\nIt would be cool if devs didn't alter minimum specs of an older product after people have purchased it and put several hundred hours in it.\n\nGuide for running older versions - \nhttps://nomansskyretro.com/wiki/Welcome\n\nHonestly, the current picture could've just has easily been the 2016 one lol. There's nothing impressive about the graphics.\n\nI commend the devs for sticking with the game, but the \"no mans sky is amazing nouw!!!11!!\" circle jerk here is wild. The game is still pretty shallow overall, and this pic tells us nothing.\n\nIt's still has the same repetitive gameplay loop, but with more bloat when starting new. I absolutely hate the starting tutorial where I have to build a house to progress, in a space exploration game. That's just my gripe.\n\nIt's so silly.\n\nIf you like the game, great.  Have fun with.  But the endless justifying and whitewashing is annoying.\n\nIt's not a different game.  It's exactly the same game but with prettier visuals and more busywork.  All they added was busywork.\n\nHonestly. It's a fine game, but when I play it, it really isn't anything that special\n\nGlad someone said it. If the image on the right is supposed to be a huge improvement, then color me disappointed.\n\nYou could switch the labels and people would be fooled.\n\nYeah need more than one image for a comparison\n\nAlso ones that aren’t on console so it can actually show the vast (or not) difference\n\n&gt;2016\n\n*looks at calendar*\n\nFuck me.\n\n[removed]\n\nIirc, they said something like \"we can fund the game for 50 years off the sales we've made\" or something like that. They aren't worried about payments. Plus, they have other game(s) in the works. Hopefully, they will do well. We need more game companies willing to admit their mistakes and fix them.\n\n&gt;Plus, they have other game(s) in the works.\n\nThe funny thing, is Hello games (sean specifically) is kind of open that they are using NMS as a springboard to test other tech and recycle it for their other games. \n\nNMS gets stripped down versions of it because of the graphics and how the current version of the game engine works. But their new game has an \"improved\" version of the water system rework that NMS is currently using.\n\nThe updates also sell more copies, so it's not like they don't have income.\n\n&gt;  that would have been full paid DLC's anywhere else.\n\nthey shit themselves with everything they offered from the bat, they seemed to correct it of course but one more reason to wait on buying games.\n\n\"Its great but you feel a funny itch in the back of your brain that you should really give them something\"\n\nLol\n\nMajor downgrade. The Gek no longer shout \"SALAAD\" at me.\n\n[deleted]\n\n2016 graphics remind me of Starfield a bit.\n\n[deleted]\n\nThe only thing like Stanfield is the colour filter, that's all.\n\nStanfield\n\nYou should see an ophthalmologist. Or buy a new rig.\n\nAs much as I love the incredible improvements NMS got, it really opened the floodgates for games just launching unfinished and getting patched over time\n\nAnd they haven’t improved the coop at all, such a shame. It just breaks immersion when your buddy is suffering from massive firestorms while you’re just chilling beside him.\n\nThat and also friends not sharing missions when playing together. Kinda stupid when each one of you has to do the same mission despite being in one group. That's what made my friends bounce off the game hard.\n\nI don't anything about the game but just from the image the old one is better.  The model actually sits in the chair.  The facial features are well defined while the new is an amorphous mass.  Is healthy &amp; fit while the new is a fatty.\n\nIt got worse...?\n\nI mean, is this meant to make someone go 'wow look at the major advances!'? It looks basically the same.\n\nI'm glad they were able to turn the page and ultimately deliver on their promises. But I'm still not buying the game, ever. There are other indy studios with better games that don't feature their lead dev going on late night talk shows and lying to everyone.\n\nI have no idea how people say this game “came back” at the end of the day the gameplay loop is the exact same\n\nUmm... is the point that they look the same?\n\nIt's still incredibly repetitive\n\nWhat a coincidence I just got into the game today.\n\nMan I'd still be playing this if the ending of the story didn't cause me to have an existential crisis.\n\nDear god I just realized the Witcher 3 is turning 10 next year\n\nNo way has it been 8 years holyyyyy shit I’m old\n\nI bought this game used for 10 bucks a few months after it came out. Came back to it a year later and didn't put it down till I was an economy crashing behemoth.\n\nThe one of the left has stronger and more unique art direction, especially with its warmer color palette that harkens to the retro-future look of space imagined in the 60s and 70s. The one on the right is generic.\n\nWhile I’m glad for people who enjoy the game now. That first expression ruined my fun so bad lol. I started playing it again to give it a chance and felt it was just as grindy as it was on release. That was 4 years ago though. I hope they made it fun!\n\nAh... No Man's Sky\n\nSunk 200+ hours into it until I realised everything I did was done in order to get slightly better ships and upgrades \n\nWhat for? So I could mine better materials\n\nWhat for? So I could get better stuff\n\nOnce that realisation hit, I kinda stopped playing...\n\nThats what survival games are, though"

The next day I try to launch and Ubisoft \"can't verify my ownership\"\n\nBro check my fucking steam library \n\nRefunded\n\nShit like that only badly affects those who play the game legitimately. If pirating is the only way you can play a game (DRM/online check removed), then so be it.\n\nReminds me of the time when Denuvo and Co were first introduced. Playing a legitimate copy with a DRM like that was a shit show. Meanwhile playing a cracked version was totally fine. In some cases the performance of the games even increased significantly when playing the cracked games.\n\nDRMs don't do shit. They're absolutely worthless.\n\nI'd love to know the legality of buying a game then downloading and playing the cracked version for convenience. \n\n\nBack in the day I bought a copy of Battle of Britain and always struggled with the CD authenticating that I could play it. Reached out to the devs who apologised and....hugely ironically....sent a copy of the German version of the game to me in the UK. Convenience designed in, but only for certain countries.\n\nThe legality is that is doesn’t really matter at all. \n\nPiracy is so hard to combat, with it being so grey like you’re proposing, most countries don’t bother at all with prosecuting people who pirate software. They go after distributors, but most legal systems literally could not accommodate the amount of people who pirate stuff.\n\n[deleted]\n\nThere's a reason they typically just go after the biggest actors.  The data hoarders who have _everything_.\n\nEven with movies they just kinda tell on you to your ISP and if you're using a VPN it's moot.  Warner Brothers is the only one I know who tries its hardest with honey pots to catch actual people to prosecute.\n\nNot the same field but a family member of mine spent his whole career in sex crimes. He said even for something as heinous as sex crimes, the legal system doesn't have enough resources to heavily pursue every single case that hits their desk.\n\nIf it's a quick open and shut like the perp was caught on camera then they'll handle it quickly. Open and shut type thing. But for the most part, he said they really only try and get the big fish. The serial offenders. The CP distributors. The ones making the videos. The sex traffickers etc. Not cause they don't wanna help everyone but because they literally don't have the manpower and resources to do so.\n\nPiracy is infinitely more common than sex crimes. Astronomically more common. It's a joke to think the courts could actually do something about it. Like you said - they'll go for the big guys with heavy convictions behind them but they arent gonna waste their time with personal use pirating. IDK why companies keep trying.\n\n…oh he worked in the sex crimes *division of law*. I thought you were being blasé about your sex criminal family friend.\n\nYes yes. Very important clarification for the meaning of the message lmao\n\n&gt; Piracy is so hard to combat,\n\nunless you live in germany where your internet provider and government happily bend over backwards to give out your name, adress, and help suing you for 3000 dollars just for downloading an episode of game of thrones, or downloading tetris\n\nGEMMA and BREIN even try to sue people outside of Europe.\n\nExcept ya know denuvo is pretty strong, not all games with it get cracked and some don’t get cracked till years later. Doesn’t do shit is isn’t exactly true, it does delay or prevent piracy for some titles. It does impact performance on some systems too still which is absolutely wild and why some games review copies will get sent without it and it’s then on the launch version.\n\nThat's only because the only person that was able to crack the denuvo left the scene, temporarily or not. Even when she was active, it took her only a few days to do so. It's only a matter of time before another talent shows up, maybe not so unhinged and spreads the knowledge.\n\nThe fact that only one person was cracking that shit and we still have no one else doing it, speaks volumes about how strong it is.\n\nIt's not so much that it's that hard, it's more a why? There usually needs to be a monetary incentive for someone to spend days doing something like that. If there is no benefit to it why do it?\n\nThere are dozens of games, it's basically a full time job cracking all the different games and types of DRM. It takes a very special person to do that, and usually if someone already is doing it nobody else will waste their time doing it as well since in software the task only needs to be completed once.\n\na shame she's batshit insane now though\n\nNow?\n\nLater they complain for the 🏴‍☠️\n\nAre they also sending out refunds?\n\nNice joke.\n\nEverybody laugh.\n\nPlease clap\n\nIn terms of meme candidates, I honestly think Jeb! would've been at least slightly more funny.\n\nAt least if we had gotten Jeb! we'd know that we were really being run by his older brother and father.  It wouldn't have been great, but it wouldn't be a lottery of what inane bullshit we'd have to put up with that week.\n\nNot until we force them through legal action\n\nHonestly besides signing all the stuff in the video trying to get some legislative change, going to small claims would also be an easy way to get a refund because Ubisoft won't bother to show up.\n\nMaybe they will ignore the court demands too and if you live in a country that has an Ubisoft office you can just show up with sherrifs and start seizing shit like what happened with that bank.\n\nWhoa....you got a link to this story?\n\nhttps://business.time.com/2011/06/06/homeowner-forecloses-on-bank-of-america-yes-you-heard-that-right/\n\njustice boners rise up\n\n\"we're sorry\" no, BoA, you're not sorry to the couple you tried to steal hundreds of thousands from and then gave them the run-around for so long. You're sorry you got caught.\n\nSituations like this, of blatant and vile theft attempts by a company to completely ruin 2 or more lives should be immediate grounds for dissolving the company, and the owner should have to pay the entire cost of transferring all accounts to other places and they should be banned from ever participating in anything that has any control over anyone's money.\n\nUntil the people that make the choices and set the policies of these companies are held liable, nothing will change.  Throw some general managers and vice presidents and board members in jail.  Then you'd see a bit of change.\n\nAs long as the punishment for being caught committing crimes is smaller then the gains from committing them there is no incentive to stop. It's just good business.\n\nKinda reminds me of the story where a dude demolished his house because the bank foreclosed on it. He missed like one payment or something and they immediately started foreclosure proceedings because the land (House, actually) was worth more than what he was paying.\n\nThing is he took a loan out on the land, then built a house. They thought they could foreclose on the house too, so he bull dozed it. He got sued, but the judge sided with him.\n\nThe problem is the people who have the power to do these things are probably being paid under the table to turn a blind eye\n\nOr you can do the reasonable thing and join the multi-national legal action specifically for this case:\n\nhttps://www.stopkillinggames.com/ is specifically about this game. With directions what to do on a per-country basis. With a direct action plan. Not some wishy-washy boycott, petitition but an actual planned attack on Ubisoft. Because UBI is a French company with a seat in the EU and they have tripped a couple legal wires with this bs.\n\nhttps://business.time.com/2011/06/06/homeowner-forecloses-on-bank-of-america-yes-you-heard-that-right/\n\nWe just have to beg the EU gods and hope they listen\n\nMan I can't believe how little Freedom™ they have over there.\n\nI want my NBA2k refund as well. \n\nThey turn off servers like 1-2 years after game was launched, and then there's literally no way to play the whole game. Even career mode is not allowed, just because the servers were turned off. And i paid 80$ for it (not dollars, but actually even more expensive in my currency)\n\nI'm from times where we could play a game 5, 10, 20 years later. I could very well download FM, Diablo, Pokemon, almost anything, and play normally. It's crazy that some companies put time limit to play a game.\n\nYour first mistake was buying any NBA2k game\n\nIf you own a copy of this game and you live in the EU, go to stopkillinggames.com and follow the instructions if you wanna help stop this.\n\n&gt;  stopkillinggames.com\n\nI followed this guide, but it turns out that Ubisoft have removed my account transaction history from before 2020. So I don't have a proof of purchase for any of the games that I own from before that year apparantly. That's like more than half my library with them, wtf?\n\nDepending on where you live, there might be laws forcing Ubi to store these transactions for longer period of time, even if they don't show them to you.\n\nThis is also a good reminder to always keep the purchase records yourself. E-mails and transaction history from your bank or payment system, invoices in the e-mails and such. Ubisoft can try to erase everything in their systems, but then you have your part of the transaction to show.\n\nYeah, I assumed I had those in my emails, but I simply can't find them. It's extremely frustrating, because I can see the games there in my library, and I can see when I played them, but not when or how I got them. \n\nIncluding The Crew which is still there, but greyed out.\n\nTry and get their customer support to dig up that info for you. Slim chance but they might find it.\n\nGDPR request for all your data might go back further.\n\nPerhaps you can find an email confirmation of the purchase?\n\nThe Pirate Party wants to bring it in front of the Parliament. Lets see whats going to happen.\n\nThe pirate party has been based ever since it pops up. They are largely bumbling idiots and too disorganised to do serious politics, at least in Germany, but the things they call attention to and the things they advocate for in terms of cyber protection and consumer protection are fantastic, and for that alone they are worth supporting.\n\nMan, I'd love for the CCC to become a party.\n\nLast national elections 6 months ago I voted for them because every other party was \"yeah no fuck that\". The Pirates seem to be least horrible of all.\n\n&gt;The pirate party has been based ever since it pops up. They are largely bumbling idiots and too disorganised to do serious politics,\n\nI think that is why they're less bad than all the others. Look at the greens. When they became a serious party they became like the others.\n\nI believe you do not HAVE to live in the EU. There is a tab you can click on for each country, and there are still steps U.S. (and other countries) consumers can take to\n\nVery true, there are some steps for other places like Brazil and Australia. Australia specifically has something potentially brewing up and Ross is collecting emails to send instructions to if/when the time comes.\n\nApparently this is their scorched earth response to Ross' campaign, doubling down and testing their legal ability to literally and directly steal from everyone.\n\nIt's a bold strategy, let's hope it really fucks them up in court.\n\nGiven the legislative power of the EU, if this happens here it’ll likely extend to at least other Western countries.\n\nUbisoft is making that Star Wars Outlaws game, right? \n\nI look forward to not buying it now.\n\nYar. No way I'm buying it.\n\nYep and sell it for up to 140€.\n\nUbisoft may not learn anything even after their fall. \n\nAt this point I just wish to see their demise since is clear they don't give 2 rat asses for us at all.\n\nRemember when people said they wouldn’t preorder games anymore after CP2077?\n\nThese companies are betting on gamers having extremely short memories and lack of self control. So I’d say not only Ubi won’t learn anything, literally nothing will change.\n\nAnd they’re right. For every million people in an online community like this that says they will never pre order, there’s millions more who don’t care and buy it anyway\n\nand even here on reddit (i know, different people etc.) you sure as hell can bet that on any new big release announcement there are numerous redditors saying that they paid full price for it already.\n\nGame released and the review thread starts? You have people buying day one without a thought and complaining how shit the game is.\n\nGamers just can't wait for reviews or just take a look at whatever they are actually buying (not just buy based on trailer or \"gameplay\" footage from the publisher).\n\nI had the most baffling read yesterday. Someone bought Vampire Survivors because he wanted V Rising and thought he bought V Rising even though he watched the description, videos and pictures of Vampire Survivors.\n\nLike wtf\n\nLeast they got a good game.\n\nThats the fun part. They didn't like it. Because they wanted a survival crafting game.\n\nAt least they got a cheap game\n\nYeah recently saw a comment of somebody who admitted they just buy new releases and dont play them because they still have so many unplayed games in their library… way to many people agreed with them.\n\nMeaing people just buy a brand bew game for supposedly a lot of money and then dont even play it. Wtf.\n\n[deleted]\n\nNew breed will also tolerate more nonsense if they have nothing to compare it with. They might not know that this same exact feature was already implemented in some other game 20 years ago, was easier to use and worked better. But since they don't know about it, new implementation is the norm.\n\n&gt; Ubisoft may not learn anything even after their fall. \n\nThe reality is, they're a step ahead. Ubisoft isn't real. It's just a vehicle used by rich people. They don't care if Ubisoft lives or dies so long as they can extract value from it. And if that extraction ends the company, that's fine, they were going to hop to a different company anyway.\n\n[deleted]\n\nThis is theft\n\nGrounds for a class action without a doubt.\n\nIt's grounds for a complete refund at purchase price in Australia if it wasn't made clear during the purchase that access to the game was only for a limited time.\n\nI'm sure they had something hidden away in their TOS, but that doesn't make it any less bullshit.\n\nThat likely wouldn't fly here in Australia. Our consumer protection laws are some of the strongest in the world, and 'but it was in the TOS you acknowledged' isn't generally accepted to be a defence for misleading consumers like it is elsewhere - the very act of misleading a consumer is not permitted, so if a reasonable person would have believed it was a permanent, irrevocable purchase, no matter what the TOS itself said, that's the end of the story and its not revocable\n\nThis. The ACCC don't give a single shit about any TOS haha.\n\nPretty sure they've stated that 2024-2025 they're going to be targeting all the shit they don't like about the video game industry. Hopefully this sort of stuff is part of it.\n\nLast time they got pissed off they had Steam paying fines because they weren't providing refunds to Aussies, which you have to do here. Steams legal team laughed at them in court and said they'll pay the fine and continue as usual. \n\nThe ACCC lost their shit, made them pay like 3 mil, and had them making their refund policy world wide. They're the whole reason Steam have their current refund policy lol. The ACCC were threatening to stop Steam selling in Aus altogether lol.  \n\nThe ACCC are a nightmare for these companies. I had a broken Switch that I wanted to take back that I'd had for like 10 days. Big store I bought it from said Nintendo told them no refunds after 8 days. I rang the ACCC and they laughed and gave me a direct number. Told me to ring the store and Nintendo and if they didn't give me the refund then to give them the phone number and they'd explain to them how consumer law works lol. \n\nGot the refund instantly after that haha. ACCC rang me a week later to ask how it went. When I told them I got the refund they sounded disappointed that they didn't get to go after them over it haha.\n\nYea its honestly not an exaggeration to say that most consumers around the world have additional rights over strictly their local laws due to our consumer protection laws and international companies needing to comply with them. They are written in such a way that they essentially boil down to 'it's illegal to be a cunt to consumers, end of story'. The ACCC even has a catch-all term for 'you were such a dickhead that even if it wasn't explicitly illegal to do what you did, you were such a dickhead its still illegal' - called 'unconscionable conduct'. And the legal standard for that one is also 'the company needs to prove what they did was fair to the consumer' and not the other way around.\n\nYeh, they're ruthless.\n\nThe whole thing in Australia where we can get refunds for things within 30 days or whatever is something companies made up and all use to try and make people believe it is true, when it actually isn't.\n\nUnless it's changed, the ACCC define a refund period as whatever seems reasonable to the consumer. It can be any amount of time really haha. I've taken stuff back to Kmart like 6 months later and got a full refund. They didn't even ask questions. They've been stung by the ACCC too many times for that lol.\n\nI've heard of some aussies pressuring Steam and getting refunds outside of the 2 hour/14 day window that Steam has because of this.\n\nYou can't do anything against the ACCC because it doesn't seem like they can be influenced. They exist purely to go to war with these companies over absolutely anything they can haha. Threatening to stop Steam selling in Australia altogether was a hilarious moment lol.\n\nThe reasonable period is about what would be considered a reasonable amount of time for the product to continue working - case in point, apple tried to maintain their limited 1 year warranty for iPhones, ACCC said yeah nah, make it 2 years.\n\nI've returned multiple games to Steam outside the window, and while I try to write something funny for the support staff (signing off Praise Gaben or some shit) - I don't push at all and have never been declined.\n\nI am now wondering if that's because I'm Australian lol\n\nMost likely it is.\n\nYou'd be surprised how many big companies just don't want the hassle of having to deal with our consumer laws lol. Way easier for them to just cave right away lol\n\nPity they aren't this tough on petrol cartels, I mean companies.\n\nBut they are pretty good otherwise.\n\nhad no idea, but that is wonderful stuff all around\n\nYou can't use a ToS to bypass statutory rights and law.\n\na lot of 'Hidden in the ToS' shit doesn't stand up in court\n\nThat doesn't necessarily make it legal tho.\n\nTOS don't let you do something illegal. I can't hide in the TOS that I now own your kidneys.\n\nFill out the steps on stopkillinggames.com\n\nRoss Scott is leading the charge on this\n\nNo telling whether it would be successful, because the policy verges on enough principles of contract law that I could see a court doing something about it, even if it’s not probable. Something like this is begging for a legislative solution tho and the landscape for that is actually not terrible right now, given a strong enough push by activist groups.\n\nPublishers will ruin their games with drm and always online to prevent piracy but have no problem getting out their own cocked hats and eye patches when they want to take away games you purchased.\n\nHell if you look into the history of any big IP owners they got their start pirating the industry that came before.  Our whole economy is an endless tower of ladder-pulls.\n\nThis is theft of an automobile game.\n\nWe'll see if the scale is grand enough next.\n\nYou wouldn't _undownload_ a car.\n\nI will no longer buy anything from this awful company. What a shitshow.\n\nUbisoft is seriously the worst. They have been pulling these from so many years now.\n\nThis might honestly be worse than any practice EA has done. This is egregious\n\nThere was that time EA tried to make you pay to play their games if you bought them preowned...\n\nIts ya boy ONLINE PASS, only $14.99 CAD. It’s funny because Ubisoft was the next one who implemented that shit so fucking pass as soon as it became a thing and Sony. Glad they dropped that bullshit.\n\n*proceeds to preorder Outlaws* \n\n-modern gamers in a nutshell\n\nFor every reasonable gamer theres 1000 people who buy FIFA every year.\n\n[removed]\n\n&gt; We need to boycott with our wallet \n\nIt's Ubisoft, it's not like they've not given you plenty of reasons for the last 10 years to stop buying their products.\n\nYep, haven't bought from them in over a decade.\n\nI'm on the same page with Ubisoft, Blizzard, Bethesda,  EA, basically all AAA except 50% of Sony and Nintendo single player games. If I can't have confidence in the company it doesn't matter how hard their game is marketed to me, how many twitch or youtube shills rave about it, how many of my friends are playing it on release, or whatever big memes are in the internet wave pool. If I see any of those names involved my wallet immediately shrivels up clenching my money in and climbs up my ass until the hype dies down and it's revealed to be a cash grab shit pile.\n\n&gt; same page with Ubisoft, Blizzard, Bethesda, EA\n\nIt's gotten to the point that a game having one of the big name publishers makes me think thrice, no matter how much I like the game or even if it's an older title\n\n&gt; EA\n\nI will say EA has been weird lately. C&amp;C Remaster and from what I understand the C&amp;C bundle release on steam were nice. I have zero trust in them or desire to buy anything they've produced ever I guess since this was all Westwood when it was good.\n\nI assume they have 1-2 people giving them general good advice though they're still EA.\n\nI'm pretty sure the last EA game I bought was battlefield Vietnam.\n\nI just snooped at their last posted financials and they’re up. What’s the reverse of boycotting? Because that’s what’s happening lol\n\n...girlcotting?\n\nPossibly due to increasing microtransactions. They don't care if most gamers stop buying their games, as long as the ones that are left spend much more.\n\nWhy are gamers the biggest rubes on the planet, completely incapable of not buying shitty cash grab products? \n\n\nSeriously they are the worst consumer group to ever exist.\n\nMay i introduce you to the average car consumer?\n\nI learned my lesson with Heroes VII. Learned it hard.\n\n&gt;  Heroes VII\n\nHeroes 6 for me, the janky weapons system, heroes not having real classes, the armies just didn't feel good. Which is such a shame as man I miss HOMM3 and HOMM5. Markal and his \"Griffon Undying\" was such a jolly fellow.\n\nSame, I tried so many times to finish even a single mission in Heroes6 but it kept booting me back to the main menu so frequently  I didnt even manage to progress to new autosaves\n\nDo you know about Horn of the Abyss? It's a mod for Heeoes 3, adds two new towns, and tonnes of content\n\nI didn't realize Ubisoft made Heroes VII. a lot about that game makes sense now.\n\nUnfortunately, boycotting games hasn't been an effective strategy. Instead, follow the formal legal complaint steps laid out on:\nhttps://www.stopkillinggames.com/\n\nReplying because this needs to be higher. There's a dude that is jumping through every hoop possible for a non-lawyer to try and prevent this and subsequently save future games\n\nThis 'dude' isn't just any dude. This is Ross Scott, creator of [Civil Protection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoaIZKTBXIM&amp;list=PL6PNZBb6b9Lsr6ZnEzRJ5FqBbSYI4rHFj), and [Freeman's Mind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SQhfkpX9bc&amp;list=PL6PNZBb6b9LvDWpI-5CPYUxG1Rnm-vr9V).\n\nIf Gordon Freeman ever gets a voice, I hope Ross gets to do it.\n\nAs a fan of his, I am so glad to see him get mentioned this high up in the comments. He has been on a crusade against this practice for years, and it's been a tough battle. As an American, the best I can do is spread his message :/\n\nRoss has been incredible for the last ten+ years running, I will support this cause whenever it pops up.\n\nHave you SEEN the legwork he has done?\n\nThis is the biggest chance we got in a long while. He made a script for everybody to follow. He has paved the way to legislators and regulators in multiple countries. And he went for the countries which are actually likely to do something.\n\nHave you heard how XBox is now emphasizing that they also are on board with game preservation?\n\nWow not only it's well done, but for each different country listed it says what to do according to each country's processes. Awesome.\n\nEdit : he even offers to refund the cost of sending the letter lmao\n\nThanks so much, as an Aussie this is straight up illegal. Fuck Ubicunt, I'm gonna do whatever I can.\n\nUs saying this over and over while every assassins creed and far cry sells like crazy every single year....the people who need to hear the message aren't the ones on here lol.\n\n[Legal action is the only answer.](https://youtu.be/w70Xc9CStoE) Boycotts don't work.\n\nA boycott would be acceptable for a lot of grievances against this industry, but I think this is one case where we really need government intervention to create a law to prevent companies from stealing from their own customers.\n\nThere is no other word to use to describe it. This is stealing.\n\nLink to the Ross video:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w70Xc9CStoE\n\n*you wouldn’t steal a car…*\n\nUbisoft: hold my beer\n\nStopkillinggames.com\n\nAccursed farms is doing a global campaign to stop this trend\n\nOn today's installment of things that should be illegal: this. \n\nYeah don’t think that‘s legal\n\nImagine you buy a tv, then one day you come back to it being gone with a note saying ‘Your tv privileges have been revoked’\n\nYep. [It do be like that.](https://www.wired.com/story/roku-terms-of-service-update-locks-tv/)\n\nThis is almost certainly a direct attack against the stopkillingames movement, they are probably trying to make it harder for people to come up with an offline patch. I checked my Ubisoft account and sure enough \"You no longer have access to this title\"\n\nReminder this the company that said: \"players should get comfortable with not owning our games.\"\n\nThis is what they meant. That eventually, every game you buy, will be shut down and forcefully ripped from your hands. Think about that when you buy the upcoming Star Wars Outlaws singleplayer game that requires a constant internet connection.\n\nEDIT: 2.7k upvotes in 2 hours, TAKE THIS SHIT TO r/ALL WE CAN DO THIS\n\nEDIT 2: WE ARE ON r/ALL WE DID IT MEN. GOOD FUCKING JOB.\n\nThey are missing out of a lot of the Steam Deck market with this always online crap.  \n\nI am avoiding them and EA like the plague.\n\nI’ll play them on Gamepass, but that’s the only concession I’ll make. Fuck Ubisoft.\n\nNever getting into the subscription model for games but definitely planning to boycott Ubisoft for a while, not even on sale will I buy from this publisher. Hope they get sued to oblivion.\n\nSteam deck is a big success and after the Steam Machine was unbelievable really, but like the handheld gaming PC market as a whole isn't that massive to matter too much. It's kinda like saying EA missed out in the PS Vita market by not releasing remasters on it, it's big but not that big.\n\nWhich is why I’m not buying any Ubisoft games. Shit companies deserve to die.\n\nI haven’t bought any Ubishit games in years. That stuff just makes me even more disinterested\n\nIt's a pretty easy boycott when they simply don't make games I'm interested in any more.\n\nThey killed Heroes of Might and Magic, and how can we forget Uplay the garbage spyware they want to side run with wherever you purchase your games, or the \"fun\" bait and switch with anno 1800. \n\nI just honestly dont get anyone buying ubisoft they've made their stance on things very clear.\n\n\"if buying isn't owning then piracy isn't theft\"\n\nThe law definition of piracy isn't theft but copyright infringment, so you are correct. Unless you steal the  physical copy from gamestop lol\n\nIt isn't meant to be a legal argument, but a moral one.\n\nTrue piracy would be commandeering a boat with shipping containers of games on it\n\nTrying to get refund as I purchased from steam. Hope it go though.\n\nGo to stopkillinggames.com for simple to follow instructions on what you can do.\n\nIf you can't get a refund, and ubisoft won't turn the servers back on or make it offline available, then you can complain to the consumer forces of france, which may end up in a change of laws and regulations, or even a class action lawsuit.\n\nWell hopefully the EU brings the hammer down on them. They seem to be the ones that do that since no other govt usually rushes to do it.\n\nYou're almost certainly correct. Why else would they do this? The timing is too perfect.\n\nI wish we had better consumer laws... I wish companies weren't so greedy.\n\nGood point about that SW game i see popping up everywhere suddenly.\n\nI got used to not owning Ubisoft games years ago by simply not giving them my money.\n\nUbisoft is dying as a company faster than they can kill people’s resistance to giving up on owning the games they pay for.  Hopefully whoever acquires the company will recognize the connection between Ubisoft’s business practices and Ubisoft’s failed business.\n\nUbisoft has been struggling well before they decided to destroy their brand and I think Ubisoft may go the way of Interplay in the 2000s.\n\nTheir stock price is in freefall because of long term problems, its been leaked they are looking for a buyout but cant find anyone interested last year, internal issues have been known for many years.\n\nNow the fear of losing your games isnt just a thing from finance bros who realize Ubisoft and their online store may not survive the next 10 years if they cant find a buyer. I doubt they will, its better to wait until bankruptcy and buy the valuable parts without buying the whole company. \n\nEveryone now fears licenses being taken away.\n\nIt’s amazing how they managed to lose money with franchises like rainbow six, AC, ghost recon, etc. feels like it should have been easy enough to stay in the green. \n\nIt's not easy to stay in the green when you don't take time to fully develop games. The latest R6 title was killed off a year after it launched because they didn't sink enough resources into planning and developing it, and it launched half-baked and stripped down.\n\nWas it rainbow six extraction? I played about thirty minutes of it and never touched it again it was so uninteresting\n\nI straight up never heard of this and didn’t know it existed lol\n\nThis is why people pirate. \nEdit: For people who misunderstood. I said \" this is why people pirate.\" I never said this is why people pirate this game. Im well aware its a server sided game.  \n\nThe real pirates are the publishers. Scamming you with full priced half finished games and then backstabbing you by dropping price by half after a month and then revoking your rights to the game and turning the games offline.\n\nThis just guaranteed I won't be buying their new star wars game. It was already iffy with their recent \"AAAA\" flop and the price tag, but yeah I'm 100% un-sold now.\n\nRoss Scott (the creator behind Freemans Mind) is organizing a movement to [stop this practice legally](https://youtu.be/w70Xc9CStoE), by using the shutdown of The Crew as a focus point! Bricking a game license that you *paid* for without offering you a chance to continue playing it or complete refund is fraudulent, the only reason it's still legal is that it hasn't been examined properly by courts (except for the US where they've largely sided with companies on this issue). \n\nIf you've bought a copy of The Crew and live outside the US, go to [stopkillinggames.com](https://www.stopkillinggames.com/) and see if you can help! \n\n[Here's an ADHD-friendly summary of the issue and movement.](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/iH7k0IZ5PYE)\n\nIf we're bitching about Ubisoft now, it might be time for me to tell people that Ubisoft's \"cloud sync\" for all their old games doesn't work. If you ever want to re-download games where the servers have been deactivated (Assassin's Creed 1, 2, Brotherhood, Revelations, 3, Splinter Cell Conviction), your saves will not download to your computer and you'll get the Failed to Synchronise Cloud Saves error.\n\nI reinstalled Splinter Cell Conviction the other day and got access to the Insurgency Pack DLC which I never paid for back in the day, but previous saves in the cloud refused to sync. Luckily I had a local copy of my saves.\n\n[removed]\n\nSteam based cloud games are the only ones I'll touch because Steam gives you direct download links to all the save files.\n\nCombined with the few games that offer private server apps it's all the benefits with none of the bullshit.\n\nFuck live service games\n\nLooks like Ubisoft needs to head in a new direction. I’m thinking they need to clean house at the top level. All C-level and vice president need to go. \n\nFuck Ubisoft. Talk about not reading the room. Talk about fucking tone deaf. This company is absolute blight on the industry. I’m sad for the talented developers they have, but their management is absolutely kneecapping their chances for success.\n\nImagine that LG barged into your home and just took your television away. Legally. Because of a button you pressed agreeing to just that, the first time you turned the set on.\n\nOr your car. Or your shoes. Or your stove. Because you don't own what you buy, it's just a 'license' to temporarily use what you paid full price for. \n\nThis has to end. This needs a legal action to end this practice forever.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/w70Xc9CStoE?si=zUM8jD7IgdxlKsRl\n\n\nThe battle lines are being drawn!\n\nYeah, I won't be buying anything from Ubisoft ever again.  Their games have been in total freefall for years anyways, so not a big loss.  Used to be my favorite publisher a loooong time ago.  Damn shame the greed took over.\n\nCrap! I use to play that game from time to time. I enjoyed just driving across the country with my music on the background. Last time was maybe a month. \n\nIt was very helpful to destress when I have so many things in my head.\n\nI'm going to miss that game.\n\nAssetto corsa with free roam mods should be a great alternative for that kind of stuff. Very enjoyable to drive around, specially with a steering wheel! Nothing on the scale of The Crew but good fun, and Assetto Corsa often goes on sale for $7 or less :)\n\nA lot of valid points being raised in this thread. Companies already have the mindset that, digitally, there's zero ownership for their consumers - and they love this... Consumers are still playing catch up with this understanding because we don't take the time to read the fine print. At best, we're 'renting' digital games but, because this is meant to be such a long-term thing, we tend to overlook it. \n\nThe majority of digital purchas simply provide 'access to' the game which could be revoked 'at any time' for any number of reasons big and small. While physical purchases typically evade this kind of nonsense (as does sailing high the seas) , Ubisoft's games are either always online affairs or need to phone home to work. Either way, it's an attempt to gatekeep that ownership, making it a little more difficult.\n\n[https://www.stopkillinggames.com/](https://www.stopkillinggames.com/)\n\nNot sure why anybody is still buying Ubisoft games\n\nIf you go to the publisher page on steam [https://store.steampowered.com/publisher/ubisoft/](https://store.steampowered.com/publisher/ubisoft/)You can go to options and block their content.  I just did.  I don't want to buy games from them anymore.\n\nI had already decided long ago to never give Ubisoft another cent.  Not ever.\n\nI'm glad they've decided to continue encouraging piracy though.  It's hilarious how they keep shooting themselves in the foot then blaming anything besides themselves for the situations they create.  Ubisoft management are collectively a belligerent 4 year old.\n\nubisoft is worse than activision.\n\nUbisoft future business model “5 year game lease, 10 year game lease”\n\nWonder where the “it’s so convenient to buy digital” and “theyd never remove peoples paid purchases” lot are now. Usually theyre so vocal when companies go full digital\n\nI can’t wait for Star Wars Outlaws to flop. Ubisoft is scumb\n\nSomeone will probably upload the game to an abandonware site\n\nDoesn't work for this one quite like that. Ross Scott does a better job explaining it but it's got something to do with needing a server to run it so they'd need to make software for hosting your own server. It's complicated on this one, i guess.\n\nIt will be unplayable without the Ubisoft servers the game tries to connect to on launch... Unless someone can redirect or patch that out.\n\nHere's some real-world action that can be taken that actually has a chance of changing things for the better:\n\nhttps://www.StopKillingGames.com/\n\nYeah but its increasing the difficulty of making the game work again when a singleplayer patch is created.\n\nIts alot easier to tell people \"Just install the game from your uPlay library and unzip this folder into the folder it installs into\" then telling them to download 20+GB from a sketchy warez site\n\nDon't buy their shitty Star Wars game!!!\n\nIf you think this not ok and want to save games from this fate visit: [https://www.stopkillinggames.com/](https://www.stopkillinggames.com/)\n\nExplanation about this: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w70Xc9CStoE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w70Xc9CStoE)  \nMinute version if you don't have time: [https://www.youtube.com/shorts/iH7k0IZ5PYE](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/iH7k0IZ5PYE)\n\n\"If buying isn’t owning then piracy isn’t stealing.\"\n\nUbisoft please\n\nWhy have the mods of /r/The_Crew removed the thread that OP linked to, along with every single comment?!\n\nThis will probably be removed soon, but [saving for prosperity](https://i.imgur.com/3vKzdIc.png) \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/The_Crew/comments/1c26d9w\n\nUbi has always had the worst practices in the industry.  Whoever buys their games this gen deserves this for supporting them.\n\n[deleted]\n\nStand your f*cking ground guys and when you say you won’t buy anything from them do it.\n\nFor some reason stealing away something you have paid for is ok. But not willing to buy something is criminal.\n\n\nCopyright protection needs to change dramatically, as in its current form it does way more harm to society than good. But each time you try to mention this, you'll get big publisher talking points as an answer. After decades of propaganda most people think these opinions are their own.\n\nI've been boycotting Ubisoft for 8 years now, stuff like this guarantees I'll never buy an Ubisoft game again.\n\ni wish ubisoft didnt own nadeo/the trackmania franchise, tm2020 is such a good game but ubi sucks\n\nStop buying Ubisoft games\n\nGrand theft automobile game."

    "all_comment_text": "This explains why Jack Black barely mentioned the movie at all on Conan O'Brien's podcast. It was hilarious actually. Towards the end he was like \"oh yeah, I'm actually here to promote a movie\". He even forgot they're called vault hunters and called them tomb hunters, when he's in the friggin movie himself. AND he played the original. \n\n\nAs soon as I heard all that I got the impression he wasn't particularly thrilled to promote it\n\nYeah bro was like “I recorded my lines before they even started directing the movie”\n\nHe did a good job of making claptrap sound interesting, the whole “against their will chipper demeanor when they honestly kinda hoped the rest die” sounds pretty good if I didn’t know who claptrap was\n\nJack black is honestly the only part of this movie I’m mildly excited for. Cause like, his take on claptrap as I’ve seen it in promotions so far isn’t quite, “claptrap”. But even jack black just being jack black, I can see that as a slightly different take on claptrap\n\nThe rest of the cast and movie though…? Idk, I’m very underwhelmed so far with what I’ve seen and heard\n\nBut like since it's a CGI character, why not let the voice of claptrap, be claptrap?\n\nYeah. This is why Jack black made me decidedly NOT excited for this movie. Claptrap has a voice. What other bad decisions did they make in pursuit of money over quality?\n\nThey should just call it Jumanji 3 Borderlands Expansion Pack\n\nThey want a name for the poster that sells tickets. That's why Chris Pratt did Mario instead of the guy whose done Mario for decades.\n\nDoing his best Linda Belcher impression\n\nLol I just finished that podcast and man did he ever why away from talking about it !! Recorded his lines before filming even started? Lmao.\n\nIt's a voiceover role, it wouldn't be necessary to record the lines during filming. Most animated shows/movies and videos games don't have the voice actors record with each other, and the animations are fit *to* their performances, not the other way around.\n\nYeah, Jack Black is a gamer as much as his YT channel is about gaming.\n\nFun fact: One of Jack Black's earliest acting jobs (at 13) was in an Atari 2600 commercial for Pitfall.\n\n\"visually repulsive\"\n\nThat's not an uncommon remark for an Eli Roth film.\n\nIs Eli Roth trying to be the next Uwe Boll, or is there a low budget horror to Video Game movie director pipeline that I’m not aware of?\n\nIts because writers and producers don't get to take credit for just retelling a story well.  They HAVE to insert in their own takes and ideas because they are so gosh darn clever.  And the people selecting who the writers and producers are, are people who are more concerned about the social scene in LA and paying off favors, and whose turn it is to get a try than who is going to do the best job because they have actually played the fucking game or read the fucking book and get it.\n\nThe highest regarded and critically acclaimed adaptations are, for the most part, ones that stuck closely to the source material.\n\n“Highest regarded” and “critically acclaimed” =/= “financially successful”\n\nI agree, the skill is adjusting the story for the screen not telling a brand new story.\n\nFirst thing I remember seeing about the movie was Ariana Greenblatt saying her Tiny Tina was inspired by Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn and was immediately thrown off by that  \nWhy is your Tiny Tina not inspired by Tiny Tina?!?\n\nAnd why is her Harley Quinn so terrible. \n\nSeriously, this is the worst casting I've ever seen in movie history.\n\nIn the trailer, she acts revolted by the piss landing in her mouth. I'm not saying I wouldn't be but given Tiny Tina's past, she's experienced a significant whole lot worse. I'd've expected her reaction to be COOOL! Or a much less girly reaction. Incredibly bad Tiny Tina portrayal imo.\n\nThe cast was the first clue the director had no idea what they were doing and has never played the game.\n\nAnytime I see an \"all-star\" cast like that, I usually just assume the movie is going to be shit.\n\nThere's a few exceptions, but usually seems to be using the cast as the draw instead of the story or quality being the drawer.\n\nIt’s not just “all-stars”. It’s old all stars and people that don’t fit the character at all. It’s like if they made a god of war movie and casted Paul dano as kratos. Good actor but never stands a single chance of fitting the physicality or personality of the character\n\nLooking forward to 10 years from now when the Rock is considered an old All-Star (if he isn’t already) and they make a God of War movie with him playing Kratos and Danny Devito play Mimir’s head.\n\nActually, an aging The Rock might fit into a God of War(2018) Kratos role.\n\nYeah I don’t think this is quite what I was going for. Does he fit the character that well? Nah but his body sure does lol\n\nThat’s what I was meaning. Like the Rock does fit Physically but you’d basically have to make Kratos a different character for the Rock to play him.\n\nMaybe a better example on my end would be Tom Holland playing Nathan Drake, I remember the movie actually getting pretty decent reviews but a lot of people were upset with the casting at first cause Nathan Drake’s a manly man and Tom Holland’s best known role is playing a junior in high school at the age of 28.\n\nGina Gershon as Moxxi, Cate Blanchett as Lilith, this would have been good casting if they were 20 years younger.\n\n\nBut I can't think of anyone less like Roland than Kevin Hart, who doesn't try at all to stretch his personality to fit a stoic character.\n\n\nClaptrap's original voice (Jim Foroda) should've been in the film. Jack Black's voice is too distracting. \n\nGina looks like a sad clown\n\n55 year old Cate Blanchette playing a 21 year old is such a strange casting descision\n\nThe entertainment industry in general but even more so for movie/TV has a massive ego problem. These hack writers think they can make whatever ip they latched onto great and better than it was by making these ips a jump point for their own worthless ideas that they could never get anyone to jump onto on their own merit instead of actually making a story that fits in said ip\n\nFallout succeeded because it was fallout\n\nHalo failed because it was nothing like halo\n\nThe Witcher had initial success because it was Witcher and then moved away and failed\n\nThese ips are being ravaged by these pathetic excuses for writers that all think they are the next big thing and that they know better\n\nYeah it's glaring these days. There are so many high quality actors/performers, production quality is high and increasing, CGI/props and other effects quality is high.\n\nThen come the writers. Quality is all over the place - often just bad. Not adhering to IP. Cliche/corny/bad dialogue. Often stories just...don't make sense. Incoherent, break character traits or are simply wildly unrealistic in the universe it exists in.\n\nSo when the quality of writing is mid to bad and it's directly up against an otherwise great production...it just makes it seem horrendous.\n\nI don't know if it's just that all these writers live in a hollywood bubble but something has to change because it's increasingly a problem with so many shows.\n\n[deleted]\n\nI have the same thoughts.\n\nIn fact, after seeing this happen so many times -- and especially with The Witcher -- I get the impression some of these writers actually *hate* video game source material. They probably view game stories as beneath them, and are possibly frustrated that they can't get to work on something more artsy-fartsy.\n\nAnother example that hurt me the most personally was Resident Evil: Welcome To Raccoon City. The first game practically begs to be adapted into a high-quality B-movie: tiny cast, taking place in a single location, simplistic horror scenario, tons of opportunities for campy action and fan service. All they had to do was get rid of the tedious video game actions and distill it into 1.30 hour of mystery and tension -- plenty of space to embellish, too. Instead, they decided to mash the first two games into a single movie, create new backstories for characters with *25 years* worth of established lore, and turn one of the most beloved &amp; cool characters (Leon) into a fucking village idiot.\n\nThese things aren't honest mistakes; they are deliberate attempts to stray as far as possible. At least the first two Paul W. Anderson movies were somewhat faithful to the general idea.\n\nJust to add a little to this with the series Arcane. It's an example that stands out by using established characters but making up a story. The reason it succeeded so massively was because it was made with care, flair and attention to detail. The character backstories were heavily modified while taking into consideration who the characters were to get something that both fits the world and gives you a character with a very similar feeling to the original\n\nThe reason it is like that is because it was created by Riot. they didnt hand the IP off to some randos. it was the people who came up with the characters in the first place who made the series. even the animation was done by Riot's usual animation partner\n\nWas anyone seriously expecting this movie to not be a pile of shit?\n\nAs soon as I saw Kevin Hart as Roland, I knew exactly what this movie was going to be.\n\nJumanji 3?\n\nWell...yes.\n\nSomeone will make fun of Kevin Hart's character and Kevin will yell at them.\n\nThere will also be a moment when Kevin Hart screams about being upset and unhappy with the situation the team is in.\n\nKevin Hart is also eventually going to say \"Ya'll can keep going that way but imma be going my way, crazy fools\"\n\nI like these cheap made-for-tv comedies.  Oh wait, this is a 120 million dollar budget movie?  Uhoh\n\nCheap made-for-theaters comedy. 🤷\n\nGuarantee at least 1 joke about Roland being shorter than expected\n\nAlready confirmed line from Tiny Tina\n\nDon’t forget when he yells about how isn’t even supposed to be involved\n\nI hate how accurate this is. Are you sure you weren't in the writers room?\n\n“You think this a video game? Then you better reset!”\n\nKaren Gillian would have made a good Lilith.\n\nAnd Cate Blanchett would've been great as Tannis instead of Lilith.  They literally had the woman in front of them and couldn't see it.\n\nBlanchett should have been commandant Steele, imo.\n\nBut then again, when is this even set? Such a mess\n\nThat's not fair, Jumanji does well at the box office.\n\nThe new Jumanjis were just as dumb, yet somehow twice as entertaining, as my expectations going in.\n\nBorderlands does look baffling though. Cherry-picking the 'popular' characters and ideas from across 3+ of the games?\n\nThe rock playing old danny devito as the rock was the first time the rock was funny. \n\nYou haven't seen Be Cool\n\nTwinkle Twinkle baby, Twinkle Twinkle\n\n*Eeeeeeeeeewwwwweeeeeeaaaazzzzzyyy*\n\nThe Rock *can* be funny, see him on snl.  He just doesn't do it much anymore because he is too protective of his 'brand'\n\nYup. None of the casting makes ANY sense. Claptrap is a VA role, use the game's VA. Roland is a big dude who's very serious and they cast Kevin Hart who is short and his whole shtick is comedy roles. Gina Gershon, Cate Blanchett, and Jamie Lee Curtis are all 20-30 years older than their characters. This supposedly takes place pre borderlands 1, tiny Tina would be like 6. If we are throwing age out the window like the rest of the cast, just use Ashley Burch. I just can't fathom how the movie/tv industry is still making these mistakes. All the shows and movies adapted from video games that have done well have stuck to the source material. Fallout, witcher season 1, the last of us, arcane, etc. Every time they make their own bullshit up and slap an IP skin on it, it sucks. See borderlands, later witcher seasons, Halo, Doom, etc.\n\nIt's movies designed by committee and studios trying to please shareholders, who want safe, predictable choices. Not exactly a recipe for brilliant film-making and well thought out casting/artistic choices.\nIt is  the same thing happening with the over-saturated super hero genre. Because it sells and it has Kevin Hart. It is big names with loud mouths (Because the general public seems to find a loud rant hilarious, even if the writing is not funny at all)\n\n&gt; It's movies designed by committee and studios trying to please shareholders, who want safe, predictable choices.\n\n\nThat is what is so baffling. They want \"safe\" choices but then when picking an IP to try and adapt they make tons of choices that turn off the actual built in audience that the property has! Like what is the fucking point of adapting a popular book/comic/video game when you throw out all the things that made those properties popular in the first place replacing them with generic bland trash?\n\nI assume they expect the fans of the game to watch it anyway, so no point in appealing to them anymore.\n\nBut beyond that, they want the actual movie to appeal to more people outside of that demographic\n\nBut what is safe about that apart from that it's safe to fail?\n\nBecause it's what people on a marketing and executive team think is going to be safe. They view this as a product with a bundle of features, not as a work of art that succeeds largely on execution. They believe that they can technocratically lift pieces of other successful movies and fit them together to create blockbuster after blockbuster. And when they fail, they don't get rid of this methodology, they assume they were mistaken about some aspect of it and try again.\n\n\nBorderlands has all the makings of a movie meant to be sold in a meeting to business interests. Big stars, focus on \"proven\" IP that they can say has already sold X hundred million dollars, with a director who's cheap but proven to be able to churn out a film without horribly mismanaging the project - and they got a pretty generic splatter horror director in Eli Roth. The project has to be financially engineered with specifics to how production and post production and reshoots will be handled so that it can be made in the most financially efficient way possible. Which in this case means a lot of reshoots with a completely different director and almost entirely made with digital effects. Hollywood has a stable of people who aren't making successful or good movies that they love because they view them more like middle managers than like artists. Add in ridiculous mergers and acquisitions and injections from venture capital, coupled with management more and more looking like the board of a Silicon Valley startup, and it's surprising we get any good shows or movies now.\n\nYou’re right, but in fairness to Gina, Moxxi has grown adult children, she may be 50s in the games and Gina is like 10 years older, but that’s honestly one of the best castings - Moxxi should be a hot old lady, which Gina very much is, it’s just in the game we kinda forget how old she is\n\nLiterally the only casting I saw and was like \"this is correct\". Gina Gershon not only has the right type of look, but also has made a career out of playing women with similar attitudes.\n\nIt was the perfect example of \"The people who made this movie did not understand the source material.\"  Roland is not a comedic sidekick.\n\nRoland is… the most “Main Character Energy” character across Borderlands 1 and 2 until… stuff happens. Why would you make him a comedic side character?\n\nKevin Hart is Kevin Hart.\n\nNo matter what role he’s in. He’s ALWAYS some loundmouth wannabe comedian with obvious little person syndrome :/\n\nBorderlands has humor. Great humor… At times (cheers comment below :)) But not the childlike humor of Kevin hart. It was obvious from the second he was casted what this film was gonna be like.\n\nHe should be claptrap. Jack Black should be the Gunzerker, Terry Crews or Idris Elba would have made a good Roland, Tina's voice is wrong, and why are Lilith and Tannis so Old?\n\n[deleted]\n\nOoh, yeah. Hit up the vfx team that did Arcane. I could see that visual style making for a solid Borderlands animated movie or series.\n\nSoooo old… all of them are too old tbh\n\nAll of the actors are about 20+ years older than the characters they are portraying. Who decided that?\n\nWesley Snipes was told he was too old to reprise Blade, who is supposed to be an unaging vampire, at 62.\n\nSo they hired a 50 year old to do it instead.\n\nThe actors themselves, who wanted a payday for CGI schlock, and the producers, who always go with the biggest names seeing cinematic universe in their wet dreams\n\n&gt; All of the actors are about 20+ years older than the characters they are portraying. Who decided that?\n\nHollywood.\n\nheck moxxie is almost as old as lilith's actor and like 3 years younger than tannis'. like... i know moxxie was technically older in game but not her 60s. mid 40s at most. then we got a 65 year old playing tannis and someone who should be getting ready to retire playing a young upstart lilith. roland is probably too old too. tina is ok but the voice ugh\n\nIdk in one clip Tina being disgusted at some gore really confirmed that that is NOT Tina.  Tiny Tina I feel wouldn't be disgusted at that.\n\nthe trailers made it seem like a weak clone of guardians of the galaxy\n\nYou mean the Protectors of the Solar System?\n\nSentinels of the stars\n\nMore like vainly hoping\n\nWhen I saw the first trailer I just said to myself….”why”\n\nI had zero expectations. I feel like that's the way to go into summer movies these days. Sometimes it works, like the D&amp;D movie last year. I came away from that one pleasantly surprised.\n\nAnd then when something like Borderlands happens, you don't end up disappointed.\n\nHonour among thieves was a love letter to the fans. These execs need to stop being so disrespectful to the source material and fan base. Netflix and the Witcher are a great example.\n\nGod I swear I've never seen a writer piss on the source material that hard like the ones from the Witcher. I totaly understand why Henry Cavill was done with that shit show and left.\n\nHe didn't quit the show... He was fighting the writers tooth and nail over sticking to the source material. It got so bad that he would literally refuse to work scenes if they were too far outside the source material. \n\nSo they fired him and recast him just to not have to deal with it anymore.\n\nI gained a lot of respect for Cavill for that.\n\nIn my book actively fighting against the nonsense they were making and trying to force them to stay closer to the source material is pretty damn close to him already being done and leaving, it's basically saying \"either you stick to the source or you'll have to bench me\". Now what people find of that is up to them, I respect him more for trying to make a stance against dumb writers butchering source material that needs no changes.\n\nOh I thought he quit himself. But doesn't matter I'm just glad he got out of that garbage show. He was a good Gerald and he did the best he could.\n\nIt's probably a bit of both.\n\nHenry Cavill and the way he's been, and continues to be, treated should tell you everything you need to know about Hollywood.\n\nOn the latest front, I'd rather not have Warhammer 40K than something that gets the Witcher, Rings of Power, or Wheel of Time treatment.\n\nTo be fair, Cavill is basically the guy in charge of the 40k adaptation. Given his love of the franchise, I wouldn't expect it to butcher the lore like the examples you mentioned.\n\nDoesn't mean it will be good, but I think we can expect him to be less dismissive of the existing franchise.\n\nThe moment I realized they cast *kevin hart* to play as roland I knew I wasn't going to like it. Roland is supposed to be the foil of the group, the no-nonsense merc who holds the group of chaotic idiots together. \n\nHe's not supposed to be this short, kooky, high-pitched voice sounding wackadoo.\n\nThe production of this movie was a huge mess. It was shot back in 2021, and has undergone so many reshoots without even Eli Roth doing them that the original writer wants his name taken off the credits\n\nIn the time this movies been in post production, Eli went on to write, shoot, edit, and release Thanksgiving\n\nAlso I don’t have a ton of evidence for this theory, but it seems as though the movie was supposed to be R originally and the reshoots are what made it Pg 13. I saw a quote where Eli Roth described it as super violent. Getting Roth for a movie like Borderlands is already weird, but to get for a Pg 13 borderlands originally is even crazier. His whole thing is making super gory splatter films\n\nWhat’s a bummer is I watched the behind the scenes video, and a lot of the cast and crew seemed to be legitimately pretty passionate about making the movie\n\nEli Roth wouldn't even have been a bad choice if they kept all the gore camp Borderlands actually has. Stuff like  shooting a midget psycho to pieces and his head flies off screaming 'thank yooooooou' is aggressively stupid but it happens in Borderlands.\n\nShoot me in the *faaace*!\n\nHonestly. How are you going to make a Borderlands movie and not include Face McShooty?\n\n[deleted]\n\nPeople born 2 years after the game came out are old enough to go see an R movie now. It makes no sense to me they would appeal to children like this. As a huge fan of the franchise I can't even take my kid to see this because of how bad it looks. There's no audience for this, what the hell were they thinking? \n\nI really want to know if the PG-13 was his decision, because he made CABIN FEVER\n\nI mean I guess he did House with the Clock in the Walls, which was a pg 13 movie with Jack Black and Cate Blanchett, but other than that everything he’s done is a super violent disturbing r rated movie\n\nRoth would have been a great choice if the went R rated and more with the tone of Borderlands 1 , which definitely had silly moments and claptrap but was also a pretty gritty dark world.\n\nHaving him direct a movie about tiny Tina and a bunch of silly internet humor is very dumb, have they watched any of his movies?\n\n\"it all just looks like celebrities participating in a Borderlands-themed escape room instead of an actual movie.\"\n\nPhenomenal quote\n\nI saw Eli say he never played the game and someone explained it to him for the movie. Like why wouldn't play the game your making a movie about?\n\nIt’s hubris.\n\nBut you would think by now somebody would understand this formula for disaster and help reign these Hollywood types in.\n\nThe actress that played Lucy in fallout went and played the damn games. Why is this so hard?\n\nCate Blanchett played all the Borderlands games in preparation and said she really liked them. Bummer.\n\nEDIT: since several folks have said it's BS. [Article.](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/borderlands-movie-cate-blanchett-gunslinger-eli-roth/)\n\n&gt; “My thumbs can barely control a phone, but I bought a PS5 and we played each other,” she says. “I wanted to know the limits of the game and what fans loved about the character. I got really absorbed in that whole world. The cosplayers. The YouTube make-up tutorials.”\n\nPeople can enjoy things.\n\nidk why but I can't even imagine Cate Blanchet playing a video game by herself, the visualization was immediately her laughing, looking to the camera \"This game is so fun!\"\n\n&gt;The actress that played Lucy in fallout went and played the damn games.\n\nShe was SO GOOD as ~~Goosey~~ Lucy.\n\nAnd she creeped the subreddit for\nMonths\n\nNo it’s goosey it says so right here\n\nElla Purnell is 2 for 2 with fantastic video game adaptations. Her VA work as Jinx in arcane took the character from a one dimensional “haha im crazy and like to make things go boom” to a very emotional performance.\n\nYea and tbh she didnt have to. Id expect the writers and directors to play the game or if her character was based off a character in the games but it wasnt\n\nThe moment I saw Lilith doing Gun Kata while dual wielding revolvers it was over, why the fuck The Siren, a character known for her freaky psychic powers is doing Gun juggling? If it was Mordecai sure I'll Buy it, but fucking Lilith? And then the action sequence looks like trash, like C movie trash, no Impact on those gunshots.\n\nAnd speaking of Mordecai, why'd they cut out the vault hunter with a cute animal buddy?\n\nOne of the best characters in the franchise. One of the most beloved and iconic that appeared in the first game isn't here. What a joke\n\nCate Blanchett is way too old to play Lilith. That's what turned me off immediately.\n\nMad Moxxi is played by a 62 year old woman. Cate is 55. \n\nIt's so bad it's funny\n\nThat one at least makes sense because moxxi is a lot older than she seems. She's scooter and ellie's mom\n\nI watched a trailer where they made a joke about Roland (Kevin hart) being short. \n\n\nRoland isn't short, at all. He's kinda tall actually. \n\nThat's the point they cast Kevin as Roland so Roland could now be the funny, comic relief male, so as to not actually be a leader and take away from all of our amazing girl characters... like fucking Tina...\n\nThis movie is a clear sign that Hollywood doesn’t know gamers. Oscar winners doesn’t always mean success. Plus I’m sick of Kevin hart. And honestly, I don’t even know why Boarderlands was selected for a movie adaptation. There’s so many other game plot lines that are substantially better.\n\nCasting him as the “big, buff straight man” is also a… choice.\n\nRoland’s from before every borderlands character was required to be whacky and weird\n\nTo Harts credit, [he actually did get pretty jacked for it](https://fitnessvolt.com/kevin-hart-jacked-physique-borderlands/)\n\nThat is impressive, but he's still a small guy. Needed a man in between rock and Kevin Hart, I feel like.\n\nIdris Elba\n\nI was thinking of Aldis Hodge maybe. Younger, tall, and pretty jacked already\n\nNo idea why they didn't go for him. He has the \"I'm surrounded by idiots\" down pat from his Deadshot role.\n\nbetween a Rock and a Hart place?\n\nI believe this was the working title for Jumanji\n\nHe’s looking good. Still, there is nothing about Kevin Hart that connects him to Roland in my mind. The casting for this movie is just awful.\n\nKevin Hart’s best role for me was his appearance on Modern Family. He plays a “straight man” doctor type and it’s the first time I’ve seen him act like a real person.\n\nI read in another thread that production on this initially started right after the first Guardians of the Galaxy film. They were definitely trying to capitalize on its success by making a similar film with Borderlands but they obviously didn't bother to ever play the game. Then it got stuck in production hell for a decade and for whatever reason they finally decided to release it when the Borderlands video game franchise isn't even really relevant anymore.\n\n&gt;They were definitely trying to capitalize on its success by making a similar film with Borderlands but they obviously didn't bother to ever play the game\n\nThis is honestly the weirdest part of so many of these adaptations. So many actors/showrunners/etc come out and say things like \"I have never read the books/played the games/etc, I just want to make this character/show my own\". How is that not the laziest fucking thing imaginable? I'm not saying you have to do shot for shot or beat for beat, but if you're adapting something just understanding the source material has to be a basic requirement no? The absolutely best work (not just personally, but critically and success wise) always comes from a team that is knowledgeable about the source material and treats it with love and admiration (even if they make their own choices and go in slightly different directions). I don't know how people can continue to justify ignoring source materials when it basically ALWAYS goes badly.\n\n\"How are people gonna relate to Master Chief unless we give him some booty to chase? And wait till you hear this... SHE'S THE ENEMY!\"\n\n\nCue gasps from the writing room and mumblings of being in the presence of a genius\n\nThe user is only partially correct in that the movie began development after the first Guardians movie. The movie stagnated with the first script being really poorly received, by both the movie studios and Gearbox.\n\nThen Craig Mazin (Chernobyl and The Last of Us) took over. His script for Borderlands was described as “fucking amazing” and many studios began fighting over it with Lionsgate coming out on top.\n\nThis is where it goes into rumour territory.\n\nLionsgate got cold feet as Mazins script was rated R and deemed too expensive so they ordered a rewrite to tone it down. After it was delivered Mazin thought it was atrocious and wanted his name scrubbed off it.\n\nIf you check the IMDB, one of the writers listed alongside Eli Roth has no other credits, which some say is Mazins pen name so he doesn’t have to have his name on it.\n\nActors not knowing the source material isn't really a big deal. It's the director's job to tell them what to do. Mark Addy never read anything about ASOIAF and yet his representation of Bobby B is an absolute knock out of the park. Harrison Ford famously doesn't care about the lore of any of his characters outside of maybe Indie.\n\n“Hollywood” is a broad brush. Look at what Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy have done with the *Fallout* tv series 🤌 a beautiful, caring recreation of the universe.\n\nSome people care.\n\nAnd then you look at the shit ass Halo series and it makes you sick, thank god it got canceled\n\nMaster Cheeks\n\nLegacy of Kain would be an excellent movie\n\nBorderlands would work if it was made like Fallout.\n\nIt would need to be chaotic comedy though but the format would work at least.\n\nA movie for most videogames just ain't it, they don't have the time to really give it justice anyway.\n\nBut who cares when you just want to steal a franchise and make it your own uh ?\n\nIve noticed animated adaptations are often way better than live action adaptations. Fallout is the exception all the other live action video game adaptations have been trash, meanwhile Edgerunners, Arcane, and Castlevania are 10/10\n\nThis shits been happening forever.\n\n\nI'm still pissed about Resident Evil movies.\n\n\nThey just take a franchise that has a built in audience, use the name to create a pile of shit ran through corporate filters designed to appeal to the most and offend the least.\n\n\nIt's not art anymore, it sucks.\n\nDragonball. \n\nStill pissed I dragged my buddies to the theaters for that pile of steaming dog shit.\n\nFun fact about the dragon ball movie. The actors were tricked into doing the movie. They were told that it was being directed by Stephen Chow, director of Kung Fu Hustle. \n\nIt wasn't until after they had signed contracts and were placed into a Mexican desert that they found out the truth.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/r2E7DJEIDsY?si=pfvInIi_hj8Bxe8_\n\nEdit: A bit of good news though was the movie was so bad, Dragonball's creator came out of retirement to write super in order to save some face 😂\n\nLmfao that’s insane. They probably saw the awful script and terrible costumes and thought “oh, this is intentionally camp like Kung Fu Hustle, Chow will make it work somehow in the end”\n\nand it would have worked if that were the plan.\n\nThey did my man Stephen  Chow dirty by adding his name to that movie.\n\nMonster Hunter was a travesty 😭\n\nThere was a monster hunter movie? 🤨\n\nYeah, it’s called Legends of the Guild and it’s a short and (bitter)sweet animated movie.\n\nWe don’t talk about any others.\n\nThose movies don't exist.\n\nSame here. Can you imagine the RE movies being treated like Peter Jackson treated LOTR? Everything thought through carefully, actors casted well, plenty of preparation, etc. It would have been glorious to see RE movies get the top treatment, not scraping bottom of buckets in desperation to milk the cow.\n\nYea I know, could be so good.\n\n\nI remember the first image I saw in a psm magazine of milla in a red dress.\n\n\nMy mind was racing, is she jill? Who's gonna be Chris and weaker and Barry? We gonna see the tyrant? The shark? Hunters? Snake?\n\n\nThen we got Alice with psychic powers and it just boggles my mind.\n\n\nEspecially because if it wasn't called Resident Evil it could maybe be cool. \n\nAs someone who never got into the RE games at all, I loved the first and second movies, but the second one was very confusing to me as a kid. After that they got way too weird and I lost interest.\n\nSilent Hill was pretty fuckin' good though.\n\nThe first one yes, it did feel like Silent Hill. The second one with Kit Harington was pretty shit.\n\nBonus points for Sean Bean not dying.\n\nI dont get it why after all these years, movie producers still decide to move away from the source material.\n\n1. If the source material is what made the IP succesful, why do you think your changes to it will make it better?\n\n2. Plenty of examples of movies/series that stuck to source and were good and ones that changed and were bad, and very very few that were the opposite.\n\nI get that producers want to reach a broader audience and make more money, but its know that changing the source material will kill the movie.\n\nI really dont get if its hubris or plain incompetence.\n\nIt's hubris. \"I know how to make successful movies\" they aren't trying to pander to fans of the game, i think they are expecting them to come just for the name, they are pandering to the general public. \"LOOK JACK BLACK! LOOK KEVIN HART!\"\n\nI mean I am not agist or anything but most of the cast are waaaaaaay too old for the characters they are playing. I love all if those actors but most of them were horribly miscast.\n\nI love Jaime Lee Curtis as an actor but they cast her as a character who is quite literally half her age. Cate Blanchett is also like a good 20-25 years older than Lillith is supposed to be. Makes no sense.\n\nAlso Cate's wig is so fucking god-awful, I haven't seen a single shot where it looks like that is hair that is actually on her head.\n\nThe IGN review said they could have called it \"Cosplay: The Movie\" but that would be an insult to actual cosplayers, and Blanchett's wig is the first thing that popped into my head lol\n\nIt’d be kind of funny to see all the critics who were writing about “comic book movies are dead, video game adaptations are king” have to write thinkpieces about this movie after it bombs and “Deadpool and Wolverine” crosses a billion. Just make good movies. \n\nBorderlands: \"We made it PG-13 to make more money\"\n\nMeanwhile Deadpool: hehe box office go brrrrrt\n\n&gt; Meanwhile Deadpool: hehe box office go brrrrrt\n\nMy understanding is Ryan Reynolds is basically the driving force behind the Deadpool movies being a thing now, and has a lot of push in keeping them R rated.\n\nNo matter what else can be said about the man, he knows his audience.\n\n...And it absolutely *prints* money when you have such a person involved.\n\nI mean look at the good things The Witcher had going for it before they shit canned Henry Cavill. We all knew as soon as he departed it'd end in failure.\n\nI don't always like Ryan but I respect the shit out of him being a  legitimate fan of the content he's making and pulling together a million threads to make the ultimate love letter to Xmen he could. He didn't have to include Channing Tatum as Gambit. That shit sank a decade ago. I still appreciate the fuck out of him for giving us that taste though.\n\nBorderlands is a movie based on a video game but not really. Lets not aim for the fans of the game of the last 15 years. Naturally, they get actors in their late 40s or(significantly) older to star in the movie to really appeal to that older crowd that's definitely wanting to see an action movie based on a game. Now let's make it pg13 to limit the gore(which the game was famous for) to try and reach the younger crowd who wasn't even born when the game series started.\n\nLike, who did they make this for? Who was their target audience? Even from a corporate out of touch view, they have pushed away all people who would remotely want to see it to appeal to who exactly?\n\nNo offense but I could probably eat a bowl of alphabet soup and shit a more appropriate cast for the characters.\n\nWhen I saw Hart was in this movie I figured he'd voice claptrap. I then saw he was playing Roland and lost all interest in the movie. The only way I'll watch it is of it eventually comes to a streaming service I'm already paying for.\n\nEveryone in every boardroom believes that everyone outside that boardroom is a complete idiot who will give their money up for everything.\n\nClaptrap is freaking iconic. Don't get me wrong, I love jack black but he's not the right casting for that and there's ZERO reason not to include the original VA who absolutely makes that character.\n\nrandy and the VA had a falling out that may be why. but seriously jack wuold have been a good marcus!\n\nIt's a real shame though, it could have been so good. They just HAD to cast actors that don't know anything about the game and are just there for the gimmick - Kevin Hart I'm looking at you\n\nBesides that, not sure if Borderlands would be movie-able either way.\n\nJaime Lee Curtis is amazing, but her being in this is just so off-putting.  I think she's the worst thing about the casting, and will still be the best thing in the movie.\n\nSorry but Cate Blanchett playing a 25 yo girl is the worst for me. Followed close by Kevin Hart playing a big serious military man like Rolan...\n\n[deleted]\n\nThey could have totally done a tales of the borderland style story! I agree the mainline games don't set up for a good movie, but there is a decent amount of ability to make a fun and compelling sci-fi adventure. The moment I saw the casting I knew it was over\n\nI feel like borderlands didn’t even have the stronger story anyway; half the characters I’ve encountered in them are just straight fucking annoying and I never would want to see a movie about it ever.\n\nFun games tho\n\nTales from the Borderlands had a fantastic story\n\nAnd then Gearbox went and made Borderlands 3 with the absolute trash fire of a story and script and burned all that goodwill from Telltale.  They took the ball and ran it all the way to their own end zone.\n\nIt especially sucked because BL3 is a blast to play. So many QOL improvements over the previous titles. From a gameplay perspective, it is by far the best Borderlands, but from a story perspective it's the worst.\n\nBL3 had wayyyyy too much voiceover/narration. Some is fine, but there were parts of the game when it felt like a hyperactive radio talk show with multiple background characters talking over each other at the same time. O_o\n\nToward the end, I just muted my TV and rage-rushed my way to the end of the game, because it was so goddamn insufferable.\n\nI still don't know how they looked at Kevin Hart and said \"Yeah that's Roland.\"\n\nJust give me a new game, not some cgi-fest with Kevin Hart ffs\n\nI hope Randy Pitchford is ousted from the company.\n\nThey can't.  He's too greasy.\n\nI’m surprised that he wasn’t let go when Nordic Games owned them, given how he is a walking PR nightmare among other things.\n\nWhen will the message sink in that the shows and movies that stick close to the source are successfully and the ones which deviate are always awful. \n\n\nLook at the difference between Halo and Last of Us for a perfect example.\n\n\nHell, Last of Us did change one or two things but they made sure it wasn't in such a way that is makes it stupid.\n\nThe Fallout tv show looked like it was lifted right out of the game.\n\n&gt; When will the message sink in that the shows and movies that stick close to the source are successfully and the ones which deviate are always awful. \n\nNever.\n\nBecause the directors have the hubris to think they know better than the people who created the franchises.\n\nAnd they also think they know what the fans like, more than the actual fans do, even though *every single time* they pretty mask-off state they have absolute disdain for them and want to appeal more to 'the general public' instead.\n\nIf the 'general public' aren't fans already, bastardizing the ip to appeal to them seems like a pretty fucking stupid idea to me even conceptually... but it keeps happening.\n\nThere's apparently infinite money to burn on failed adaptions, and nobody *ever* listens to the criticism.\n\nGood\n\nAnyone who wasn't expecting this is delusional. Game films are generally shite, but the last nail in the coffin for me was Kevin Harte as Roland. The tall, powerful, serious, stoic, leader of men. Kevin Harte. \n\nIf that's how little effort they're putting into their casting, what can you expect other than abject failure?\n\nImagine if they gave it to Terry Crews instead.\n\nThe man can do tall, powerful, serious, and stoic, but also funny AF when the time calls for it.\n\nStop giving Kevin Hart roles\n\nThis movie has been failing for years already.\n\nI have lived my whole life in the bliss of not knowing this movie existed.\n\nI revelled in the forbidden fruits of reddit, and now I am tainted by knowledge.\n\nI yearn for the simpler times, when I knew not the horrors that befell the world"

    "all_comment_text": "Company makes more money in year they release very successful game vs a year when they release no games at all. \n\nShocking really.\n\nReally make you think\n\nWhy not just release a hugely successful game each year? Poor management really.\n\nUbisoft has been trying that! They must be doing great\n\nThat's really stretching the definition of \"trying\"\n\nI dunno. Every game Ubisoft releases is at least one of the games of all time\n\nAlso one of the games in the world, universe even\n\nContinue existing just to spite the odds.. oh my god.. I'm like the Ubisoft of people.\n\nYou be soft, dude\n\n&gt; universe even\n\nI wonder if there are other universes out there where Ubisoft makes quality games.\n\nProbably not, but it's fun to pretend.\n\nWe were in that universe until the great universal split of 2016\n\nThey used to be on top man. Its really sad what they are now. The last good game they made was Watch Dogs 2 from 2016 and every other game has been kind of mid and just bad. That prince of persia metroidvania game that came out this year was really good but the team got laid off. Ubisoft was at its peak in probably 2012 or 2013. Now its just dying fast.\n\nIt’s so tragic to see. I loved Watch Dogs and AC man…I didn’t enjoy AC Odyssey but couldn’t even get halfway through Valhalla :(\n\nI have the very specific kind of brain rot that Origins, Odyssey, and Valhalla perfectly satisfied. I know they were bad, like.. I get it. But man I was just in the zone for literally hundreds of hours getting 100% on all three. I can't explain it, but it felt like Ubi made those games just for me, or someone involved has the same kind of moldy brain that I do.\n\nThose are beautiful games though. The zones are visually pleasing to look at, and I believe at least quite accurate to history. The only issue i think is the dragged out open world gameplay and needless quests. Adults don't really have too much time for games due to other commitments. I think they have to strike a balance for their playerbase. Teenagers aren't gonna have enough money to buy all the game and content, so target market for the price and how the game plays are  just different.\n\nI really liked the protagonist in Origins, Bayek. He is one of the best up there with Ezio imo.\n\ntime to invest all of nana's monies into ubisoft!\n\nIs this the new gaming circle jerk? I feel like it's been 5 years since \"DAE Witcher 3 Good EA Bad\"\n\nMore seriously, this is Call of Duty's MO with 3+ studios in an alternating cycle to usually hit once a year (it slowed down at COVID) and they are the most profitable franchise.\n\nCalm down there FIFA/Madden.\n\nThat’s a genius idea, you should run a game company\n\nHonestly, this is the biggest problem with publicly traded companies trying to create art. They always need to provide a return on investment or else why are the investors buying their stock and not a profitable one?\n\nPractice shows that even 10 years of development isn't a guarantee of releasing a good game. (I mean Veilgard, that has 0 replay potential, where only an illusion of Role Play, and your choice doesn't matter)\n\nThis is deep. Says a lot about our society.\n\n&gt;!**[Revolver Ocelot]**!&lt;\n\n&gt;!*Revolver Ocelot*!&lt;\n\n\nedit:&gt;!REVOLVER OCELOT!&lt;\n\nTrueeeeeee\n\nHas anyone investigated this? Surely there’s a correlation but who knows\n\nI think it is just a coincidence that people started randomly sending them money right after the release. Weird phenomenon.\n\nYeah, why did I suddenly do that last year? \n\nI did it too. Smells like a conspiracy….\n\nIn other news: Recent studies have shown that people are more hungry before they eat than they are after they eat.\n\nBack to you, Jim.\n\nThanks Nancy, now more updates on the weather. Meteorologists now confirm when it rains things will get wet.\n\nJoe here with sports, now we see sun shining at the field on sunny weather.\n\nTune in to Joe's sports podcast, where he explains how the team that scores the most points in a game is the most likely to win.\n\nI earn more money on one day of the month than the rest of it combined.\n\nPls share your secret\n\nHe is a male prostitute with 1 very rich client ofc\n\nWhat Wall Street bets does to a man\n\nWhy don't they release a very successful game every year? \n\nAre they stupid?\n\nWe should all do it at least once a year, to be honest.\n\nMBA’s don’t understand how this happened. The proper solution was to massively cut the work force in 2022 so they didn’t lose as much money that year. How they survived without maximizing short term profits is truly an unsolvable mystery. \n\nand the title is framed in a way that 260m seems like a super high number when the game is a masterpiece that took multiple years to develop.\n\nLarian deserved every penny and then some.\n\nThis is a perfect example of why companies sometimes pay $0 in taxes in years where they have high profits. \n\nConsider that Larian spent multiple years in the red while developing BG3. They get to roll those losses forward against this $260MM to reduce the amount of profit they need to pay taxes on. \n\nSpecifically they get to use the 2023 \"profits\" to climb out of the hole they dug in previous years, first. Only once those losses are made whole do they begin to owe taxes. \n\nOver time, a company is taxed correctly on all lifetime profits. It's the arbitrary annual checkpoints that make it look like they aren't paying taxes.\n\nBig if true.\n\nthe real takeaway is that it's worth it to invest time in a project since the gains will cover the loses. what a company would take away from your comment is \"release a game every year\"\n\nThis is how gaming used to be back in the 90s. The main thing I remember about those days is tons of studios went bankrupt because, despite the game selling well, it didn’t actually cover the costs / make a profit. It’s a huge risk to ‘bet the farm’ for years in hopes the game makes a profit. Companies like Sierra (or other publishers) eventually stepped in and acted as the money-man, then when those games didn’t make enough, they’d shut down the studio and move personnel elsewhere. That’s kind of what led us to the giant corporate video game industry. Games are a huge risk, and that’s a big reason we keep getting sequels / known IPs being remade, because it’s safer\n\ni wonder if there's any examples of games that were worked on for several years and weren't successful when released\n\n*Kingdom of Amalur: Reckoning.* \n\n\nIt started in 2006 with $75 million by famous baseball player and avid MMO gamer Curt Shilling. They got other investors too.\n\n\nThey hired every single great game developer and created a brand new IP with intent of spinning out single player and MMO in a big uniform  crossover series of different games. \n\n\nIt relocated the studio to Rhode Island when the starter government kicked in another $75 million.  \n\n\n2012 the game is released and flops. They needed it to make $100MM a year to cover costs. \n\n\nThe studio closes bankrupt with over $150MM in debt.\n\nOh, that's a crazy story. I really enjoyed the game and wondered why there was no sequel\n\nYeah, it is a real pity. The game is not perfect, but it is definitely very enjoyable. Like a 7/10 or 8/10 depending on your tastes. And the world building is amazing. Getting R. A. Salvatore to help with it was an amazing idea, and it translated super well. Combat is also very nice, like an improved version of Fable 2, imo.\n\nThe game idea was really neat.\n\n&gt; famous baseball player and avid ~~MMO gamer~~ piece of shit Curt Shilling\n\n\nftfy\n\nHe was both a piece of shit and also obsessed with MMO\n\nConcord lol\n\nTons.  But most of those were unsuccessful for various reasons; very few of them were unsuccessful because they weren't rushed out ASAP half-finished.\n\nAlan wake 2 was worked on for years and was received well but still hasn't turned a profit\n\nConcord\n\nDuke nukem forever \n\nPC gamer makes more money than Larian by pumping out worthless articles\n\nYeah I think the alpha was paid, so I guess there was probably revenue there, but definitely not as much as a full launch + rave reviews &amp; an enthused audience\n\nThis is why we get copy-paste or half baked games like Madden or CoD. EA or Activision need to show a profit for their investors. \n\nLook at Ubisoft. They put all their money on Star Wars Outlaws selling like gangbusters and it didn’t.\n\nHey guise, why don't we just push a game into production every year without all the hassle of QC or creating interesting content?\n\nOh wait...\n\nGuys, Divinity: original sin 2 is also a really great game by Larian.\n\n..and was wildly successful. Why does it feel like so many Redditors think Larian didn't exist before BG3?\n\nThe same reason From Soft didn’t exist before Elden Ring\n\nI'd say people are more inclined to believe that fromsoft didn't exist before Dark Souls. \n\nThe game won tons of Game of the Year awards when it came out. Even from major publications.\n\nIt might not have been the most popular game on the planet due to its difficulty, but it was still very famous.\n\nthe King's Field series by FromSoft can be frustrating, but lots of people who like the soulsborne games might be into it. \n\n\nIt is less intuitive (in my opinion) but full of really interesting exploration and experimentation. It is also technologically ancient to the point where I suspect any laptop made in the last 15 years could run it.\n\n\nI'm just trying to gas up people into trying King's Field-likes because there are some cool ones out there and currently in development that I am trying to will more support towards.\n\nShadow Tower Abyss is my favourite pre-Souls From title. Armored Core 3 is up there too.\n\nLunacid. The correct answer is to play Lunacid.\n\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/1745510/Lunacid/\n\nCookie and Cream bros RISE UP\n\n&gt; I'd say people are more inclined to believe that fromsoft didn't exist before Dark Souls.\n\nThese kids don't know about lost kingdoms.\n\nI still think Demon's Souls is one of the top 3 in the series.  It did so much right and tried so many things that were new to mainstream gaming.  Demon's Souls deserves the majority of the credit that Dark Souls gets IMO.\n\nEh, Dark Souls would've been a better comparison. FromSoft was well-established by the time Elden Ring came out. Hell, Elden Ring was pretty much the most anticipated thing in gaming for a few years next to Cyberpunk.\n\ngo look up how many copies of dark souls 3 and Sekiro sold.\n\nMore like before Dark Souls. \n\nNot many people played DeS and even less know about Armored Core even now.\n\nYeah, totally not true. Dark souls was well known before eldin ring was a thing.\n\nSekiro won game of the year 2019\n\nBecause BG3 transcended the targeted demographic Larian made their games for.\n\nIt's funny bc I've been championing Larian since I first stumbled into Divinity II: Ego Draconis on a steam sale. They make absolutely banger games and I put them up with Supergiant Games in terms of consistent quality\n\nPraise Maxos, rarely do I meet another who loves Ego Draconis in the wild.\n\nThe idea of turning into a dragon just tickles me pink, and I'll be forever glad that Steam decided to suggest the game to me.\n\nPeople think they're a tiny indie studio, and they get mad when you point out that they're one of the biggest multi-studio game developers in Europe.\n\nIn fairness, they only got so big *for* BG3, they massively expanded for it. I think they went from ~150 employees to over 400 in a very short time. \n\nBefore BG3, they weren't indie devs by any means, but they also weren't particularly big either.\n\nIt was pretty niche prior to BG3 to be fair\n\nTrue, but they are still a very old studio. A year younger than Bioware. Managed to stay independent and privately owned though.\n\nYea, I absolutely hate it when people try to push this narrative that Larian is just some indie studio that did a one hit wonder with Baldurs Gate 3. While in reality they are a well experienced AA studio that has been making banger RPG games since 1996. Their first really successful games being Divine Divinity back in 2002. \n\nFrom software suffers from a similar situation as well.\n\nBg3 had a lot wider range of players I guess. I never heard of Larian before, knew some of their games but never played any since I usually stuck to other genres. The feedback on bg3 was so amazing that I tried it anyways tho\n\nWildly successful yes and super fun, but compared to the staggering success of BG3 in terms of sales, awards, and general cultural impact it's like night and day\n\nLarian got a double sale out of me because I went back and bought this after playing BG3, I'm sure they saw a healthy boost to past titles after the success BG3 had.\n\nAnd, honestly, I liked Divinity more than BG3.  Yea it wasn't as polished or pretty, but I enjoyed the broader/more leveling system and lack of RNG with dice rolls.  I guess my lizard brain liked seeing big damage numbers go up and misses because of rolls frustrated me sometimes.\n\nGive us divinity 3 with the polish, updated graphics/engine and budget of BG3 and that is going to be a **monster** game\n\nI like aspects of DOS 2 more for sure, but I love dnd so I think I enjoy Bg3 more overall\n\nThat's interesting, it was the other way around for me. I enjoy D&amp;D and love both BG3 and DOS2, but thought BG3 being based on 5e D&amp;D was its worst feature since Larian had to struggle really hard to try to fit their excellent combat design in around D&amp;D's boring classes like fighter and monk.   \n       \nDOS2 had warrior types using a bunch of cool abilities every round, while for BG3 they were stuck with classes like barbarian that just spam basic attacks over and over. To their credit they came up with some pretty good workarounds like weapon actions, but working off such a flawed base means that area was never going to be as good as it could have been.\n\nYeah, I think the combat of DOS2 was better than BG3, but I enjoyed the world of BG3 a bit better.\n\nVery much so. There was more manpower, time and money spent improving it and its great to see such things are scalable, they created the exact kind of game except *more so* so we got a world even more fleshed out with more amazing little touches. The whole game does everything that DOS2 did well, and does it even better - except unfortunately combat, where it went from \"I charge through the enemies with Battering Ram, then take them all out with Whirlwind\" to \"I make a basic attack and then another basic attack\".\n\nBang on the nose, Bg3s biggest detraction is that it used D&amp;D combat classes and spells instead of anything actually good.\n\nYup. Its biggest weakness is the reason it was so successful. Dnd  has massive name recognition.\n\nThis is me too I was having flashbacks to tabletop days.\n\nImagine dos2 blackpits in ultra HD 🙃\n\nI liked dos:2 more than bg3. The Cinematics and production value is down but the story and combat were both better in my opinion. Worth playing if you liked bg3 anyway imo!\n\nAnd Divinity Original Sin, the game that resurrected them as a studio and kickstarted (eheh) the cRPG renaissance along with Pillars of Eternity.\n\nOnce I (finally) beat BG3 I'll probably move on to DOS2 assuming i can still buy it\n\nWith some incredibly stupid hard prologue. But yeah. Spent 120+ hours on my run.\n\nThe only hard part about the prologue is resisting the urge to add on new mods and start over... I've still yet to do it...\n\nWhat hard prologue? On the boat?\n\nHe means the prison island i think\n\nYeah on highest difficulty, unless you are cheesing you need to plan out every encounter, actually use consumes, etc.\n\nThose goddamn crocodiles...\n\nhard prologue?\n\nThey probably mean Fort Joy.\n\nYou still don't have the option to get skills and it's not like there is anything to fight to level up and the physical/magical armor on some of the enemies can really be hard to get through if you have a balanced party composition.\n\nI ended up brute forcing my way through the whole fort to try to see if there was some path or encounters I was missing, but it didn't seem like I was missing much.\n\nI don't know about the others but I did some fights scaled for a full party of 4 with 2 members. That was brutal. \n\nIt also doesn't help that you are learning about the mechanics and levelling is \"permanent\" during the prologue/first act.\n\nThe prologue is two easy fights though. I think this person is considering the prison the prologue when it’s part of the first act. The boat is the prologue.\n\nIf by the prologue you mean the whole prison segment that's the best part of the game.  Lik 99% of the time when you see a post hyping the game it's content from that chunk of the game.\n\nI actually think it’s the better of the two, Dos2 vs BG3 but that may be an unpopular opinion\n\nthat's probably more of a style and ruleset preference\n\nGood for them! Looking forward to whatever they're making next!\n\nThe industry needs more studios like them!\n\nI smile everytime some other company whine because Larian set up unreachable standards for gamers. Either give me a compelling story and gameplay or die. I'm talking to you Ubisoft.\n\nIt doesn't even have to be with rpgs.  Space Marine 2 is laser focused on providing the combat experience of a superhuman soldier in overwhelming combat conditions in a grimdark future.  You have virtually no options, but that's fine, that's not the point of the game.  Same with Doom Eternal, just laser focused on maximizing intense combat.  It's about figuring out the game they want to make, and making the best of that they can.\n\nNah man, settle for microtransactions, lootboxes ans pay to win modality /s\n\nStudios are building games a mile wide and an inch deep to appeal to the widest group of consumers possible and end up appealing to very few. This costs more money, as they're trying to cram as much stuff as possible into a game, make it as shiny possible, and with as many trends as possible.\n\nYour examples, Rockstar's games, Larian's games, games in niche genres, aren't building games that target every person under the sun. They're building games with a set boundry of what it is and isn't, and then making it really good at what it's supposed to be. \n\nWe need so much more of that.\n\nAnd then claim they're making AAAA games instead of AAA and that's why they need to charge more\n\n\nLmao\n\nThis reads like you’re holding the studio at swordpoint\n\nI think they are somewhat right in \"Whining\" as gamers tend to compare overall good/decnet games (in the context of ALL titles) that have obvious flaws to milestones in the medium. \n\nYes, BG3 is Great and yes if we want to see progress in the medium games like that are Benchmarks and lighthouses on what is reachable.\n\n  \nOn the other hand it makes the conversation broken when it is a BG3 vs. Starfield comparrison and setting BG3 not as the examplatory title that it is, but as the new \"this game is good and a fitting benchmark for the next 5 years\". \n\nWe need to be better and find a fitting term for decent games, just like movies have a ton of good movies that aren't the greatest thing since sliced bread. We don't compare Marvels storytelling to something like The Godfather\n\nAs others have said, this is literally how game development works. It makes sense you don’t make money when you haven’t really put out anything new, and you make back that expenditure when you release your game. Every game is a gamble too. This is why so many studios have been bought out by bigger publishers because publishers can better manage the financial burden of financing game development and they can juggle development assets between projects to help mitigate costs. \n\nThe only reason this could even be considered at all noteworthy is because Larian is a very small studio relatively speaking.\n\nSeems weird that they could *supply*  that much entertainment and make less than a billion.\n\nYeah, kinda crazy. I am playing BG3 for the first time, I am 50 hours in and I think only 2\\3 of being done the main story. And i didnt even do every piece of content, i'd probably have to replay 1 - 2 more times for that. All for 60€ cost... Extreme value\n\nBrother, I'm 500 hours in and have not seen every piece of content.\n\nAt 500 hours for $60, you’re paying about 12 cents per hour of enjoyment. One penny for every 5 minutes played.\n\nAct 3 still should have been way more polished. The last stand is a joke.\n\nYeah. Act 3 is so content dense that it's silly, feels like when your D&amp;D campaign took a year and you need to wrap up all the story quests in a day. Makes it feel super rushed and unpolished. I still loved the game but no desire to replay, I'd buy an expansion even though I know they said they won't make one.\n\nI beat the game once. I've started over god knows how many times. Get to end of act 2 and then started a fresh run lol\n\nTrue. It's much better now with all the added content and cutscenes, but nowhere near as good as Act 1/2\n\nYou’d need so many more play throughs than 1-2 to see all the content lol. 400 hours in still finding new shit on various playthroughs. Act 3 alone is PACKED\n\nAct 3 just now and overwhelmed and yeah there are choices you have to make or you won't even access certain story elements\n\n\n\n\nThe game kinda forces you into multiple playthroughs cause even im saying I might be evil and follow the Absolute and see what happens\n\n&gt; And i didnt even do every piece of content, i'd probably have to replay 1 - 2 more times for that.\n\n1,000 hours, beat the game a handful of times, and there is so much content I've still never seen.\n\nYou’re practically speed running the game. I was at 180 hours before I even hit the third act.\n\nThat’s _profit_, ie after paying expenses. Gross income is a _lot_ more\n\naccording to the article, their overall revenue was $446 million\n\nAdd in Hasbro's cut of $90 million and the platform holder's cut of 30% you're getting about 800 mil overall revenue for the game?\n\nHasbro only got 90?\n\nI still would have expected more. To compare it with another game released last year, D4 made $666 million in its first week and over $1 billion within a year, with $150 million just from microtransactions.\n\nI guess the EA 90$ copies carried a lot of D4 revenue, still BG3 revenue is just insane.\n\nBut also that's a yearly expense, not the total dev expense.\n\nDeserved BG3 is the best game I've ever played \n\nlemme introduce you to a game called raid shadow legends\n\nPlayed best through Nord VPN! Use this code for 10% off!\n\nYou never have to leave the couch with factor, 10% with code FACTOR\n\nI like that I can say \"BG3 is the best game ever created\" without even a hint of doubt in my mind. Like, obviously some people don't like CRPGs. But for me, it's at the very top, and *nothing* else is close. Except maybe DOS:2.\n\nDOS:2 Tactician was a more satisfying system then BG3 Tactician. I would fight on this, the only problem with that game is that the armor system is complete dogshit.\n\nEven aside from the armour system (which is *awful*), I find DOS2 does its difficulty in the most frustrating ways possible. I'm not sure exactly what changed between the games, might be that they altered companion pathing to put more distance between everyone, might just be the reduced AoE quantity, but every single gosh darned DOS2 fight is \"oops I walked into an encounter I didn't know was there, my whole team was standing on the exact same pixel, now they're all on 1/4 health, knocked down, frozen and mind controlled, and also the entire planet is on fire for some reason and I haven't had a chance to take an action yet\".\n\nNot to mention, even when you memorise the locations of ever fight and carefully space everyone out ahead of time, it's still a nightmare of instant kills and lockdowns. For instance, walking up to fight the very obviously signposted giant voidwoken boss of death in the act 2 area that creates the zone of decay, splitting my party and throwing out prebuffs, then having the boss win initiative, take *nine* consecutive actions in a single turn (for those who haven't played the game, you'd expect 2-3 normally), and bring my tankiest character from full to dead without me getting to do anything.\n\nIt's an incredibly cheesable system, has some of the most ridiculous and funny exploits of any combat system I've seen and there is genuine entertainment value in that, but god I hate trying to interact with DOS2's combat in any kind of \"fair\"/intended way. I am one of the world's biggest D&amp;D 5e haters, the system does suck donkeys and is one of the only bad things I'll ever say about BG3, and I still end up craving some nice, honest BG3 combat every time I go back to DOS2.\n\nAlso every single fight in DOS:2 just turned into the ground is on fire or random effects. They did a good job in BG3 turning those effects down.\n\nI'd argue Dragon Age: Origins is in that spirit as well, taking into account its aged quite a bit by now. Every other part of that franchise is meh though, Baldur's Gate 3 (and Divinity) is the proper successor.\n\nThat was the main reason I loved BG3 at first sight. It was the first time we got something like DA:O except modern because every actual Dragon Age sequel has been a disappointment\n\nThere's been some weird attempts to rehabilitate DA2 and DA:I in the last few weeks, as if they weren't both mediocre and disappointing compared to the original.\n\n\nI finished DA2 once and never looked at it or thought about it again. I have no idea how people managed to play through DA:I. Bought it on sale and barely made it 4 hours.\n\n\nI'd go so far as to say DA2 was the inflection point where Bioware really started to go downhill. I remember DA2 getting all these weirdly positive reviews that didn't match people's experiences at all, like the journos were playing something else or not playing very long. That was in the pre-Total Biscuit era.\n\nlet me introduce you to dwarf fortress.\n\nNewbs. Should have been doing mass layoffs in those years to compensate.\n\n/s\n\nDon't forget the loot boxes... /s\n\nIt is a great result but just shows how even one of the bests of best singleplayer games cannot generate as much revenue as good live services one\n\nI heard a lot about this game. Do you think a 1060 3GB could handle it?\n\n1060 6gb was a lag fest for act 1 an 2, and then act 3 was completely not playable.\n\nI played BG3 on my old rig: i5-6500, 8GB RAM, AMD 380r 4GB VRAM (compareable to a nvidia 960)\n\nI finished the game, and could enjoy it. The 1060 is a far better GPU. You can lower the graphic settings, but BG3 is a very CPU-heavy game. Up to Act3, the game was fluid around 30+ fps. Act3 is in the city Baldurs Gate with lots of NPCs and houses with multiple levels, and will demand CPU and GPU power. I experienced fps dips in the city.\n\nIf you're looking to upgrade at all, you could just buy a Steam Deck. I've got about 500 hours on BG3, multiple play throughs and about 90% of it was on my deck. I actually preferred the format over my computer.\n\nThere's a minimum spec list. Check that and see how you fare\n\nFor a game that was in development for 6 years? And people wonder why we don't get more games like that. EA Sports earns more than 7 bilions EVERY year. And all that is basically because of two games. Fifa (or whatever it's called now) and Madden.\n\nWell one is a good game and the other is a glorified slot machine with the sole purpose of manipulating people into wasting money.\n\nLet us praise Larian and belittle EA as is correct.\n\nI think my nephew tried to explain Fifa to me and the cards and I basically said so that's gambling.\n\n\nHe was trying to build his team and again paraphrasing honestly never played it but he was building a team and need said players platinum(?) cards cause they have the best stats and you can't compete online without having them or something along those lines \n\nYes Ultimate Team is disgusting. It is much worse than you imagine because every release you start from the scratch.\n\nYou drop hundreds of dollars (if you want to be serious about competing) and next year you have to do it again\n\nNot only do you start from scratch, but don't the cards have limited uses, meaning you have to keep grinding no matter what you do?\n\nThey're not talking about the value of the games but the fact that making the same game every year makes infinitely much more money. So all the more respect to Larian for providing actual good games\n\n&gt; And people wonder why we don't get more games like that\n\nWe do not wonder why, we know why.  It's easy to just pump out bullshit that makes money hand over fist.\n\nLet's instead praise studios that actually put in a ton of effort.\n\nThe fuck is baldur bucks ?\n\nThey frankly deserved it.\n\nBG3 will be counted amongst the greatest ever games made.\n\nthis is such a stupid article. of course they don't make money unless they release games.\n\nWhat's the coversion rate of Baldur bucks to Stanley nickels?\n\nIt's easily in the top-5 games I've ever played. I hope they will continue BG3 with expansions and why not do Neverwinter Nights 3 in the same engine as well.\n\nhttps://www.ign.com/articles/larian-studios-wont-make-baldurs-gate-3-dlc-expansions-or-baldurs-gate-4\n\n:(\n\nWizards of the Coast made sure of that and I don’t blame Larian for this\n\nIs quarter of a billion that much these days in gaming? For small studios sure, but they have Wizards of the Coast license for it\n\nFeel like just yesterday GTA 5 was the most expensive game ever made\n\nProfit ≠ revenue. Profit is what's left after operating/production costs. Some licences take 30-40% of revenue, can't be sure how much WOTC takes but quarter billion in profit is quite impressive after that. \n\nHasbro put out a earnings report earlier in the year, showing 90 million in revenue from the licensing agreement. That was feb, but at least gives you an idea of the split.\n\nThis is profit. You have to subtract the costs of development, marketing, licensing etc. I'd say BG3 has made at least half a billion, or even closer to 800million, in earnings.\n\nI mean in terms of just profit? Yeah that’s a huge number \n\nI mean that’s one year of profit. It will continue to sell for years and it’s basically all profit at this point minus some trivial overhead\n\nIt's a good amount for a singleplayer release with no microtransactions.\n\nlol yes, that is a metric fuckton of profit for a company like Larian. \n\nAlso, if you compare things to the biggest money printer of all time, of course it will look disappointing\n\nDeserved every dollar and more IMO\n\nGood, they're one of the few game developers who actually deserve it\n\nMay they make another $260 million. They created of the best and most memorable gaming experiences.\n\nStill need to play BG3. DOS2 was amazing.\n\nIf you liked BG3, go play Divinity: Original Sin 2.\n\nAll of economic history: you spend money to make money.\n\nModern CEOs: you make money and make money and take money from anything else to make more money until the business crumples, then move onto the next business, like a plague.\n\nSounds like a gaming business.\n\ni thought they still get revenue from Divinity: Original Sin series, they're still selling from ITAD data and there's an increase in ownership\n\nCompany makes landmark RPG, releases without copy protection, follows up and supports community and still makes a profit?!? Yes can be done, walk tall, Larian, this the way, and thank you for Baldur’s Gate 3.\n\nAll hail Swen Vincke and people he gathered in his company! 🫡\n\nThey deserve it!\n\nHonestly, I’m kinda surprised it’s not higher. They’re consistently topping the best selling games charts and have been for a while.\n\nNo gambling in the game hits the bottom line hard. Why do you think companies keep doing it despite the bad PR.\n\nThe moment the game was available to purchase I did. Never in my mind there was any doubt they couldn't deliver, I played the first EA for a 100 hours writing them feedback and bugs I found.   \n\nAbsolutely deserved success and I am very eager what they would do next. I'll be purchasing it again day one. Hopefully we get what Sven promised, a Sci-Fi game!\n\nJust wait till you see how much genshin generates a year.\n\nProfit and dividends are somewhat problematic, if you don't have a pool of money to get yourself through the dev years, then you're gonna have to shut up shop if a single game flops.\n\nSource: every company bought buy a monolith, squeezed for profit, made to make the \"hot new\" game, then excoriated of staff and stripped for assets when it all goes tits up.\n\nMajor companies suddenly deciding they don't do X and Y anymore because the last cycle was unprofitable is an ugly, risk-averse stupidity and I hope larian has a warchest so they can continue to focus on making good games\n\nlol what is this title. I think everyone lost money in 2022\n\nI wonder how much it cost in totality to create BG3.\n\nAnd they deserve every penny\n\nI know it’s never happening but with how tired and exhausting emil pagliarulo’s writing and direction at Bethesda has been, I would LOVE to see Larian handle the next Elder Scrolls"

    "all_comment_text": "I remember leaving my GameCube on for days on end trying to unlock Mewtwo in Smash Bros Melee.\n\nSame and then I learned you could just plug in a second controller and it makes it MUCH much faster. \nSuch a good memory with that game, man.\n\nDid all that work and I used mewtwo a handful of times before going back to Ness 😂\n\nGotta catch 'em all.\n\nMewtwo back air bullying was top tier. Also a down air into air dodge landing and grabbing the enemy was amazing. Telekinesis tech... Edge guard with orb charging... N-air platform chasing...\n\nUmm, i guess i pick Luigi?\n*Slaps buttons with wonton abandon*\n\nWanton lol\n\nWonton abandon is when a Chinese chef quits his job\n\nI know what i said 🥟\n\n[deleted]\n\n^ this guy mewtwo’s\n\nMe but with Ganondorf 😂😂\n\nSay what now?\n\nIt was 20 hours of playtime, but since two players are playing, you get double time.\n\nThey're gonna lose their mind when they realize they could have had 4 players for 5 hours\n\nOr 20 players for 1 hour!\n\nWe're going to need a GameTesseract for that one\n\nOr infinite players for an infinity small amount of time that humans can't even comprehend!\n\nThey may also write the entire works of Shakespeare while they're at it.\n\nDope lol\n\n4 controllers?! Optimistic. I was just glad to have a friend or two.\n\nI never had four controllers 😭\n\nI'm in my 30s. I got the game when I was 9. How did I never know this? Thats way easier then doing like 700 vs matches\n\nThe game counted play time for all players combined, so if you have a second controller, it doubles how fast playtime accumulates.\n\nI thought it was only 24 hours? I remember leaving a textbook on top of my GameCube thinking one of the cats would turn it off lol\n\nEdit: looks like it was 20 hours if you had two players so I probably just forgot about plugging in a second controller, still left it for more or less a day. 24 year old memories aren’t perfect, who knew \n\nEdit 2: I put 14 years old instead of 24. Jesus that is *bleak*\n\nProbably, this was back when we were too poor for computers so we relied on rumors from friends.\n\nYep. That's why I had a rib removed. Worth 👌\n\nEVERYONE ITS MARILYN MANSONS BURNER ACCT!\n\nIf you beat 1P mode in under 5 minutes with ness on Very Hard with no deaths and get a perfect target practice with &lt;100% damage on Master Hand, you'll unlock Purin!\n\nTRUST ME BRO, I READ IT ON CHEATCC AND EVERY ONE OF THOSE CHEATS WAS REAL\n\nHoly fuck I forgot cheatcc existed\n\nthe amount of excitement and disappointment for some of the cheats on cheatcc, I was let down far too many times\n\nWhat about gamefaqs?\n\nThe Mew is under the Truck. I swear it's there.\n\nOn super smash melee, my friend and I always made sure our favorite character stayed as top kills on our own saved file, so when he’d get marth close to my dr Mario in total kills, I’d let a bot match of all dr marios run all night while I slept to boost dr Mario’s total kill number lol\n\nA few days? You only needed to do a match for about 30 minutes. Me and my friend literally put a 5 stock match up on his system and played a game of basketball outside. By the time we were done, we came inside and unlocked Mewtwo.\n\n.\n\nI love when people do things like this.\n\n&gt; Why is this a problem? Some Black Ops 6 players were racing to become the first to hit Prestige Master level 1,000 and thus reveal the rewards themselves. Indeed, entire groups of players were working together to reveal the rewards first through legitimate play. One such group, called Nuke Squad, is made up of Call of Duty streamers who are sharing their accounts in order to hit the coveted milestone, but are now complaining about Beamishh getting there first.\n\nlol @ account sharing cheaters complaining about someone using ingame mechanics to level up without working shifts like dogs\n\nAccount sharing is considered cheating by the devs themselves so they should be banned for it.\n\nDevs gave them a ban exemption and they still got out paced LMAO\n\nBack in my day max levels took decades. Looking at you Tibia\n\nThose KMMOs where there'd be one guy who was level 97 despite played 28 hours a day for 7 years.\n\nLol, oof what a throw back. Absolutely impossible levels and play times that everyone tracked but the devs.\n\nThis is from back in our “mew is totally under that truck” type of rumour days but I’m fairly sure it was quite the event when the first guy on our server in Metin2 hit lvl 100 (or was it capped at 99?).  \nNot anything fancy nowadays and last I checked they’ve long raised the level cap to 120 or something.  \n\nThe difference back then was that there just wasn’t any content past lvl 70ish, so aside from next to no benefit for higher levels other than bragging rights (skill points started to become useless since you had everything maxed at 86, you’d just continue to get 3 mostly useless attribute points per level) there was no more new equiment past lvl 75 and the only mobs you were able to even farm for EXP gave so little that single percent points of a level up meant hours of grinding in a dungeon that had no notable drops\n\nI think with the level disparity you’d eventually stop dropping anything too, not even money to buy new potions\n\n&gt; Devs gave them a ban exemption\n\nDisgusting priviledged scum\n\nI hate how game companies cater so heavily towards streamers, give them free stuff, exempt them from rules.  Makes me tend to skip games\n\nI mean it makes sense, supporting steamers is basically really cheap advertising.\n\nDevs rarely take action against pros or major streamers in any game.\n\nThere are dozens of top ranked PUBG players / streamers that blatantly use wall hacks, with videos posted to the PUBG sub all the time and nothing ever happens\n\nThe free advertisement outweighs the cost\n\nRules do not apply to the rich and powerful no matter the scale.\n\nit unironically makes me so happy that these washed streamers thought they had a couple months of free content, but got totally hosed by this guy\n\nThis is my favorite part. These people had gotten a sweetheart deal with the dev not to be banned for exploiting and were looking forward to creating months of drivel content of them mindlessly playing a shitty game, trying to create value from nothing and no content, and now they can't. Not that it was doing much anyway because CoD streaming is dead af.\n\nWhole thing: \"Hey! They cheated better than us! No fair!\"\n\nI enjoy attending cultural festivals.\n\n\"Mr. Activision HELP US!!!!! We were abusing a strategy that gets EXP 24/7 to get max level, but this guy abused a different strategy to get EXP 24/7 and beat us!\"\n\nI'd sympathise a tiny bit if this was for the specific goal of being the first, but we all know they were going to spend months uploading dogshit videos like \"WORLDS FIRST LEVEL 500 - INSANE REWARDS!?!\" with a photoshopped gun camo for the thumbnail.\n\n&gt; This itself has caused some to wonder why an exception was made for Call of Duty streamers and content creators, leaving regular players with a disadvantage or facing a potential ban for employing the same tactic.... Santana has suggested Zombies AFK exploiters could get banned.  \n\nLet me do my cheating, but don't anyone else dare abuse the system.\n\nFuck the ‘Nuke Squad’ 😂😂😂\n\nThey should renamed to Cuck Squad.\n\nSounds like Nuke Squad is comprised of crybaby bitches.\n\nI mean they're Call of Duty players. The odds favored that likelihood by default.\n\nFuck them losers lol.\n\n\"hey! Our cheating was more fair!!!\"\n\nRemember when games were for fun?\n\nFuck those noobs 🤣\n\nThe same energy of killing friends spawn camping each other during quick matches to farm nukes. You didn't earn it don't complain\n\nA fucking men. I know it's accepted now to be a professional gamer, but if this doesn't highlight what a joke it is, I'm not sure what will.\n\nYeah once they started letting stream teams just start playing one account to do this, the races meant nothing.  These clowns are getting fed double xp codes and playing 24/7 because they are rotating players and they want to cry that someone else beat them.  None of you are the first legitimate player through play time.  It also doesn't matter at all!\n\nI remember leveling athletics in Morrowind the same way.\n\nI remember doing this to 100 sneak in Oblivion, put an elastic band on your stick to always be moving, just continuously walk into a wall nearby and NPC lol\n\nI remember leveling up alteration in Oblivion but shooting the unlock spell at the same door for hours on end lmao\n\nI always did it right at the sneak tutorial where the game just hands you a goblin who is looking away and is scripted to never leave his post unless he detects you.\n\n[OP leaving the starter dungeon like](http://i.imgur.com/nVpwvjk.jpg)\n\nWith the way Oblivion leveling worked, you'd enter the world at like level 12 but with no combat skills compared to the enemies at that level\n\nA lesson kid me refused to learn.\n\nA lesson adult me learned very hilariously.\n\nMy character can jump into and out of combat easily.  Which is good, because if combat happens I have no chance to live, I can only flee.\n\nTown guards ftw.\n\nThats only if you picked sneak as a major skill. Your level only levels up when your major skills do.\n\nMan that was such a bad system. Great way to fuck yourself really hard if you don't understand it from the get go.\n\nEnemy scaling was brutal as well \n\nForgot this when I replayed recently and left the Kvatch quest until level 20 or so and got fucked up. An entire castle of spider daedra paralyzing you while a squad of daedroth come to beat your lifeless body. One of the hardest missions I've done on any game lol\n\nI was not expecting that caption in the picture. The Fappening is a time that doesn’t get talked about as much as I expected it to be\n\nDoesn't matter. Just crouch and moonwalk past all those clowns now and then abuse custom spells and sneak attack damage multipliers\n\nThere was a hotel room you could do it in with an npc close enough below lol \n\nThe Dark Brotherhood quest that gives you the Blade of Woe has you killing a guy who just spends almost all day in bed in an inn. That's when I'd do the rubber band sneak trick and get my level 100 sneak.\n\nOblivion was my first, so Rubberband around the analogs while I let my boy swim and build Athletics.\n\n\nThere was an Inn with a really low ceiling, so I would spam Jump in one spot for hours to get Acrobatics to 100. \n\n\nCasting the lowest level Unlock Spell on a Barrel to level Alteration.\n\n\nSitting there for hours, letting Rats attack me, while I healed myself to level my Armor skill and Restoration. \n\n\nSpamming the Persuasion Dialogue minigame to make everyone love me and level Persuasion. \n\n\nI spent so many hours on Oblivion!\n\nI'm pretty sure oblivion programmed me to run jump everywhere\n\nThis was peak gaming in the 00s.\n\nfun fact about acrobatics in morrowind: the higher your skill, the steeper of an incline you can walk up\n\nso if you boost it to 50000 with alchemy exploit, you can just walk over everything lol\n\nCant you just make the super jumping potion and just jump across the map if you want.\n\nThe player’s ability to just completely break everything with general game-knowledge over time in Morrowind is satisfying in a way that I don’t think has ever been fully recreated for me. \n\n1st play through, an hour in you’re walking around with a shitty sword and some rags or beat up armor, terrified of everything. \n\n15th play through, an hour in you’re leaping and flying around like a fucking CHIM’d out fantasy AC-130 with a bone to pick.\n\nI'm down in the Virgin Islands, and back home Satisfactory is still running and pumping out nuclear pasta. \n\nGranted, it's a single player sandbox so it's fine, but it's bringing me joy.\n\nYou're playing games the correct way, the way it gives you joy.\n\nWait... is Satisfactory like a first-person Factorio?   Oh no.  I wish I didn't have this knowledge.\n\nIt is also more relaxed afaik. No enemies to worry about like factorio. There are creatures you can kill and they will kill you too but they're not as much of a threat\n\nThe car size spiders that jump 300 feet into the air bag to differ\n\nArachnophobia mode has been so nice\n\nHonestly, the cat gif scared me more. Are they still cat gifs after the 1.0 release?\n\nYeah, and they kinda suck. It still moves like the spiders, and you know it's a spider. I wish they'd implement an actual arachnophobia mode.\n\nSsssshhhhh shhhhh shhhhh. Don't mention the green ones\n\n[deleted]\n\nYou can also download a mod to replace their models with a kitten if you want cute instead of horrifying.\n\nafaik this is a built-in setting, not a mod\n\nThe game is amazing... You've been warned.\n\nBad news, your power grid just blew\n\n[deleted]\n\nTrain one of the lizard doggos to do it.\n\nFICSIT APPROVES!\n\nIm suprised to see a Satisfactory post this high up. But yeah .5 pasta/m is just fine when you have infinity minutes.\n\nSt. Croix represent 🙌\n\n\n\nI've totally fallen in love with snorkeling this week. It's unbelievable. I've kept snakes and turtles in my bedroom for 30 years, and this week I've been swimming with green sea turtles bigger than me! Just flying together! It blows my mind! This place is just unbelievable. Holy cow.\n\n&gt; One such group, called Nuke Squad, is made up of Call of Duty streamers who are sharing their accounts in order to hit the coveted milestone, but are now complaining about Beamishh getting there first.\n\nSo, a bunch of streamers were account sharing (prohibited) in order to cheat the system and get to the top level first. And they're now annoyed that someone else cheated the system and got to the top level first.\n\nYeah, that's sounds like streamers all right.\n\nWell, that guy didn't even have the decency to be making money from doing it!\n\nThat's why they're pissed.  Cut into that sweet streamer revenue.  Why bother watching them now?\n\nIt's fine when they do it!\n\nHonestly this is better than spending the time to actually get there legit. I play the game and it's a grind, it can be a fun grind but for the most part it isn't and if you have a job or school, grinding camos isn't viable as it eats away at your play time\n\nI got diamond SMGs and bowed out the camo grind. I'm happy with that. The difference between Diamond and Dark Pulse or whatever it's called is disgusting\n\nI did dark matter in CW and usually do it for MP most years, but it's feeling like a massive grind in this one. On the surface, it looks easier at least in mp, but the number of specials and elites you need is stupid.  Also, having to unlock each darm matter after getting every opal is annoying, finishing the diamonds used to be the end of the grind.\n\nyea especially with that second rocket launcher that doesnt lock onto shit needing you to shoot down 3 killstreaks per match 10 times (good luck getting 3 killstreaks that are actually possible to shoot down in a match with the current SBMM)\n\nI got 1/10, my friend finished it, but I think it was luck.  I was hitting CUAVs for a short while, but completely lost the knack of it.  It's bullshit that UAVs and CUAVs fly at different altitudes depending on map, there's no way to really learn it.\n\nI might be dumb, but don't you not need to worry about the launchers now that the dlc guns are out?\n\nCamo grind has been a fools errand for years now. A significant number of my friends play just with camo's in mind and bitch about literally everything else in the game, so clearly it works at player retention somehow.\n\nI still think the best camos are Red/Blue Tiger &amp; Gold. Theyre such a classic\n\nThat is all true, but this guy did it to get to Prestige 1000.  Are you interested in grinding to prestige level one thousand?\n\nThat OG MW2 Prestige 10 emblem unlock calls my name....\n\n.... Too bad I've never made it further than prestige 4 in a single COD besides MW2\n\nThat’s where I’m at. I’ll hit master prestige but never make level 1000. Which sucks because I want the Black ops 2 prestige master emblem but oh well\n\nMan when I first hopped on the game and saw all of the older prestige emblems I thought you'd unlock them as you prestiged, was actually looking forward to grinding through it, made it to prestige 1 level 56 and saw they still didn't unlock the older prestige 1 emblems and was gutted lol\n\n(Also on a side note, The prestige 5 emblem in BO6 just being a large number 2 is infuriating, just make that the prestige 2 emblem god damnit)\n\n&gt; One member of Nuke Squad, called Santana, tweeted to say they were “robbed.” “So saddening to see zombie exploiters ruin the level 1,000 rewards,” they said.\n\nGo outside. Pet a dog. Talk to a woman that isn't related to you.\n\nEspecially funny when it was pointed out that the streamers - with a ban exemption from the devs - were account sharing to grind it out anyway.\n\nJust mad they lost views. Such is life. They’ll be fine.\n\n\"They cheated in a more effective way we didn't think of! That's not fair!\"\n\nThey would have absolutely done the zombies exploit if they knew about it beforehand. Pot calling the kettle black.\n\nIdk if they would’ve though. They are streamers after all and no one would watch their streams if they were just doing an afk zombie glitch. This is their jobs and they do want to make money from people watching their streams. Like someone else said, they’re just pissed because it means less views for their streams now that the Prestige 1000 has already been reached. \n\nI relish these lost views. I relish the extra two months of shitty, boring, phone it in content they were planning to do being lost and hopefully worthless. I hope they keep doing it to ever dwindling stream numbers. They're already not even breaking 50k, what is even the point of continuing? Just call it done like everyone else did, guys.\n\nWhats even funnier is that these assholes were given special treatment by Treyarch to account share in order to get to Prestige 1000 and they still got beaten.\n\nAnd they have the audacity to cry about it.\n\nFuck streamers. Vampires, the lot of them.\n\nI wouldn't say all of them, but probably 95% of them. I like the streamers that don't consider themselves playing video games as content creation. It's the ones who are all \"I'm creating content here!\" while stealing other peoples' content or while just grinding out a game that I hate.\n\nSantana isn't even good. Doubt he would've got this anyway\n\nThey're mad because they got robbed of the content they were going to rob from someone else.\n\nAs if anyone was actually getting to level 1000 by legitimate means.\n\n[I don't think I will.](https://i.redd.it/l44dg5fhog4e1.jpeg)\n\n&gt;Talk to a woman that isn't related to you.\n\nDamn, you can do that??\n\nThis is one funny article. As in the Streamers who are upset cause they weren’t first yet breaking rules themselves/getting “special permission”…at least the glitcher admits he did glitches to achieve it and is not trying to hide it like these streamers do\n\nWhat's shocking to me is that its about to be close to 2 months since this game released, like why is time going so fast all of the sudden?\n\nYou're getting old\n\nthat hits way harder than it should, damn\n\nA decade turns to a year. A year turns to a month. A month turns to a day. A day turns to an hour. An hour turns to a minute. A minute turns to a second and a second turns to a blink. Enjoy every blink. They are fleeting.\n\n2015 is going to be a decade ago in less than 30 days.\n\nLies...LIES!!!\n\nI AM STILL YOUNG MAN!\n\nSo don't blink my eyes and I'll live forever. Got it.\n\nThe sun is the same in a relative way but you’re older. Shorter of breath, and one day closer to death. \n\nEvery year is getting shorter, never seem to find the time…\n\nSo old he thinks 25 October was 2 months ago\n\nhis username checks out..\n\nDunkey is still waiting for the game to load up\n\nTime doesn't pass quickly, it's when you don't do anything remarkable in your daily life that it seems to pass faster because all you recall are the same chores and habits you do everyday.\n\nIf you did different things every day you would feel like you've been productive and gotten tons of things done in a short amount of time\n\nWait what the game came out 2 months ago ?! I could swear it camd out like 2 weeks ago.\n\nOK I had to check this cause it seemed off to me. It came out 5 weeks ago, Oct 25th.\n\n&gt; Santana replied to this suggestion by claiming that Call of Duty publisher Activision had told Nuke Squad that its members were allowed to account share for the race, but were restricted to no more than six people, and no more than eight hours for each person playing. This itself has caused some to wonder why an exception was made for Call of Duty streamers and content creators, leaving regular players with a disadvantage or facing a potential ban for employing the same tactic.\n\nI hate this with a passion. Rude\n\nLol wtf?  Activision made it impossible for any non-cheater to win, they'd literally ban other people for doing the same thing.\n\nThose douches figured they had it in the bag with their cheat-pass.   It's funny as hell that they got out played.\n\nReminds me of the time I juryrigged a rotating fan and a ruler to keep myself online on World of Warcraft to camp for the Time-Lost Proto Drake (very rare mount).\n\nTook me two weeks on a tree branch before I got it in the middle of the night.\n\nThen I did the same for my girlfriend at the time and it only took two damn days.\n\nAnd the third time it only took 2 hours.\n\nstart a Time-Lost Proto Drake business immediately\n\nIt's gotten easier with the new sharding thankfully. \n\nI camped aeonaxx for weeks back in cata and had him despawn while I was clicking to mount for the combat part. \n\nNow with sharding you can get a shard by yourself so you are gaurenteed to see the rare that shares the spawn or the TLPD within I think either 6 or 8 hours? If you get in a fresh shard it immediately spawns one of the 2 of them. I've had him spawn 3 times and the rare a bunch but I'm usually too late or doing something else like qued content.\n\nThe ultimate way to win Call of Duty truly is to not play\n\nI've been winning for a couple of years now by simply not buying the games. I've slowly realised that Call of Duty just isn't fun for me anymore (and there's way better experiences to be had elsewhere).\n\nI mean, yea there's better experiences, but there's not really any good fast paced casual fps like COD out there.\n\nI say this as a person who spent the past couple of years looking for a shooter similar to COD to get into, the closest thing to it is xdefiant and that isn't great.\n\nSay what you will, I've never had more fun playing solo zombies in any other COD game, the campaign is also phenomenal, definitely one of the best in the series, it actually tried doing something a bit more serious than just shooting your way through bad guys for 6 hours.\n\nOh no, a streamer didn't get it, so then can't get all the fame and clicks to fuel their sad little lives, wah wah fucking wah!\n\n[deleted]\n\n[deleted]\n\nThe only reason I read the article was to find out and it's not even remotely discussed.\n\nMaybe getting himself set up in some unassailable but visible location near a pit or something? Do zombie deaths from fall damage count as kills? I'm thinking it's something like that.\n\nI wonder if they found a spot near a trap just out of reach of the zombies and like put something on the button/key (or a script maybe?) to keep activating the trap constantly. Seems like the manglers and abominations should still be shooting you though... Who knows\n\n[deleted]\n\nHe had a macro with the jetgun that allows you to fire it infinitely. The macro also periodically moves you so you don’t get afk kicked. There’s a frenzy guard glitch that allows you to remain in it permanently so it’s effectively impossible to die if you’re spamming the jetgun.\n\n*“You cheated!”*\\\n*“So did you.”*\\\n*“But you cheated better so you should be banned!”*\n\nHow’s my summary?\n\nBut how, he'd at least need to reset 10 times for the prestige levels\n\nSave files in Zombies persist between prestiges.\n\nOh so you can save the game and quit, prestige and then load the save and continue the grind. Probably had a timer set up after the first couple prestiges once he figured out how long it took to go from 1 to 55.\n\nOnce in the original killing floor I leveled up engineer class guy by letting a zombie bash a door all night while having the welder aimed at the door with a weight on the button.\n\nabused implies a victim, this just means used lol\n\nNeat\n\nCan someone explain how you can afk in zombies without dying, and how that even earns any xp at all?\n\nF*cking IGN with their crappy site coding &amp; ads makes it almost impossible to read the article.\n\nI gave up after 30 seconds when the website reloaded itself 5 times. I'm too old to try to read through that kinda bullshit.\n\nOh no he gained something that doesn't mess with gameplay... Looks like I couldn't give a fuck. Good on him\n\nPeople out cry about this but not the hackers in rank.\n\nI fucking LOVE all the tears from the \"groups\" grinding for it together. Sharing accounts, playing 24/7, and you got got by an afk soloing.....  Imagine putting a group together just to grind a videogame account to max... for the likes?? Nothing better than no-lifers getting a little perspective.\n\nHonestly I’m just glad that guy stole the joy from those 6 sweaty ass account sharing dudes\n\ngreat accomplishment, anyway…\n\nlol, the group of guys pissed at someone beating them.  One even suggesting a ban for the guy who “robbed”.  Chill the fuck out.  Dude paid for the game and sat around against PVE until some cosmetics were available.\n\nHis virtual penis is now 0.0721333... micrometers longer\n\nThis is the most gamer move ever.\n\n\"Well that explains the utilities bill for that month.\" - Mom, eventually\n\n\"Abused\"? It's a clever use of game mechanics! It's not up to the players to not use a glitch they find. It's up to the developers to fix stuff like this.\n\nWe used to have to do this for the original Playstation if you weren't able to get yourself a memory card. \n\nYou had to keep your machine on until you were able to beat the game\n\nOf course it wasn't legitimate. Anytime I hear of a CoD player being the first or only person to do A or B, it's always a glitch or exploit.\n\nI miss when nobody gave a shit about stuff like this let alone see an entire article published about it\n\nReminds me of in Horizon 5 where you could do a stupidly long race, leave everything on all night with most don't actually play the game yourself options enabled, rubber band over RT and come back in the morning to stupid amounts of exp\n\nForza 2 you could hire ai drivers, I would do the longest race possible go to school and come back to $$$\n\nI remember in Fable 2 how the amount you got paid for your various business was tied to your Xbox clock, so you could just go offline and set it to a year ahead and get a massive payment.\n\nthat’s on the developers, sorry\n\nPeople cheating by sharing an account complaining they were robbed by a player cheating by not even using the account.\n\nSound about right for a call of duty game.\n\nI remember taping my PlayStation controller stick, grinding a loop fountain on Tony hawk, going to school and coming home to 999999 points. 😎\n\nOH NO!!!!!\n\n\nAnyway...\n\nI feel like at P1000 the reward should be getting your money back from buying the game 🤯\n\nThere will be people mad about this\n\nPeople who only play games to be better than other people, and not to actually have fun"

In your face, what do you see?\n\n[Who knew the soundtrack to existential dread would be so upbeat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3fiaPBDfv8)\n\n🎺 🎺 🎺 \n\nSo many great tracks from this (and other) Pokémon games.\n\nEdit: Now that I think about it though, this generation was a period of flux for me. I still enjoyed the games, but I did start to have an existential moment while playing. I noticed for the first time that this experience didn't feel quite the same as I remembered the previous two generations. At the time I couldn't figure out why, the game was beautiful, lots of new Pokémon, some of my friends were playing, too. \n\nAt the time it scared me, but looking back it was an exciting time of transition.\n\nThe Dive Theme and Route 113 absolutely fuck in this game.\n\n100%, so good.\n\nI'm pretty sure I spent years at sea in Pokemon Sapphire like I'm Captain Ahab or something\n\n[And this (re-)masterpiece](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exutnZKmZ50) I swear I listen to it very often and I get goosebumps all over.\n\nAs much as I enjoyed Gen 3, I think I felt the same way because Pokemon started to show its feature bloat. Gen 2 was a complete upgrade from Gen 1. Gen 3, meanwhile, only had one region and only had 200/386 Pokemon available at first. I was definitely disappointed I couldn’t transfer Crystal Pokemon up to Sapphire as well\n\nidk, base building, AI friend teams, the little extra contests made the game feel very full. As in it felt like a pokemon world by the end game.\n\n\nI played og red and blue, yellow, and tried gold/silver/crystal. They were so nice, but it's the feeling of old gen which is its own comfy space. Gen 3 was exciting to me and showed me potential. I shortly dropped off after that though when year after year felt like new pokemon games and I was quickly burning out from trying to keep up with systems and the friends who played them.\n\n\nI wish I could enjoy the series again but things are moving way too fast to enjoy it.\n\nI'm Grinding for this gym right now, combusken, skarmory, and tentacrul do me good\n\nThat 7 year old kid that said that really fucked me up forever\n\nWhere is this from?\n\nPokémon emerald\n\nA lust for blood as I enslave sentient magical creatures and force them to battle for my own amusement and to improve my social standing in a harsh, cruel world.\n\nCollecting a trophy from each large city I conquer after exploiting their leader's weaknesses for my own gain.\n\nTraveling from city to city whirlwinding orphans lost in caves, on bike paths and grassy fields. The sweet acrid taste of last night's figy berries on my breadth...\n\nPalworld really scratched an itch\n\n\\* Despite everything, it's still you.\n\nThat quote left me reflecting a lot when I was younger and still does\n\nRunning through the ash on the route by the volcano was my favorite\n\nI spent so much time trying to get those flutes.\n\nAs a kid I thought the flutes could summon some mythical or legendary Pokemon. I think I got the connection because of the Time Flute in Colosseum summoning Celebi.\n\nYeah, this is before those effects were \"common\", they were still cool as hell when they happened. Remember in Mario 64 when you go into that room with the mirror and see the cameraman!\n\nThese were the last Pokémon games I bought. They still work along with my Gameboy Advance SP!\n\nSame! I clocked over 300 hours into Ruby before the battery died and it stopped tracking.\n\nIf you have any soldering ability, or a friend with some, you can replace the battery. I did mine a while ago now but it was pretty easy. At the time there were packs of batteries with leads already cold welded on so it was even easier.\n\nI used tape and literally just taped it down. The case hold it in place and just use a piece of tape\n\nThe battery is just for the day/night cycle and lottery tickets. The game should still work\n\nBerries don't grow and the daily/weekly challenges don't happen anymore \n\nand replacing the battery is actually pretty simple\n\nIt does, but it doesn't track time played anymore.\n\nThe battery isn't used to track play time. Just clock based events, mostly things that happen once per day, as well as growing berries.\n\nYou should still have that data. The battery in RSE carts just provides time/date tracking.\n\nThere was an urban legend I read about the space shuttle launch place on one of the islands once. The guy there would tell you the time since the last launch, so if you went there at I think 100 hours or days or something, you could go up into space and catch Deoxys. I was so let down by that\n\nIt's a fucking war crime that none of the games are available on the Switch. Literally just direct ports with online access. I'd pay the $100 Nintendo would undoubtedly ask for.\n\nI genuinely do not understand why they haven't done this. \n\nSometimes I find myself complaining about the same being true for the Fire Emblem franchise, but then I remember how much smaller that market likely is. \n\nBut Pokémon? That shit is literally the biggest cash cow ever conceived. How have they not put the minimal resources necessary on the task of giving the whole franchise the Skyrim treatment?\n\n&gt; I genuinely do not understand why they haven't done this.\n\nReleasing affordable ROMs of their older games would eat into their $60 yearly releases, so they don't. They don't want people playing HG/SS or Emerald or whatever for their Pokemon nostalgia fix, they want people spending $60 on the latest game.\n\nAlways wondered why they were so quick to sue people over piracy, but refrain from re-releasing classics. But this genuinely makes the most sense.\n\nStill seems short-sighted to me. If there are great games out there, people will play them - classic, or new. They could get casual gamers (which their ads like to target so much) to buy more consoles. But instead, they act like they've plateaued.\n\n I wonder what the trends look like for folks playing classic games on PS &amp; Xbox, by comparison.\n\nI agree. The logic on Nintendo's side makes sense, but I have a hard time believing the cannibalization of sales would be that high. I'm very highly slanted towards the first few gens and would certainly prioritize buying them over a new game, but that doesn't make me much less likely to buy the new game in addition to the throwbacks, nor does not having the throwback available make me more likely to buy the new games.\n\nBased on my anecdotal experience, the people who want these retro games available the most are the people who grew up with them, and probably aren't the core demographic target for the new releases anyway.\n\nThey could easily charge 40 bucks for every game and plenty of people would buy it. It's a missed opportunity by them.\n\nJust make a $60 pack. People would probably buy it.\n\nWhat's wild is the Virtual Console store for 3DS *did* have the OG Pokemon titles. Then we lost them and piles of other stuff when the Switch came out.\n\nNintendo loves its artificial scarcity that literally benefits nobody except resellers and turns off revenue streams they could be collecting on work done decades ago.\n\nThe games are 20 years old, emulators are free. It blows my mind you guys keep wanting to give Nintendo full price for rerereleased games\n\nWhat would be really cool is if they brought them out and a cloud service to store and transfer all our Pokemon between games\n\nYou mean the thing they just took away? Pokemon Bank was exactly that (with some extra steps for older games) and they decided they were done supporting it. Releasing gens 1-5 on switch, even with no updates, and then allowing them access to home would make them soooo much money lmao. They just won't do it\n\nStill got my original gabeboy ^^*gameboy, colour, advance and advance SP - all still work, along with almost all the pokèmon games for each\n\nGabeboy sounds like a steam variant of the Gameboy\n\nOne of the last times pokemon felt like it was technologically ahead of its peers\n\nYou have been awarded [a ribbon](https://archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/1/10/Footprint_Ribbon_VIII.png/40px-Footprint_Ribbon_VIII.png) for having a top-quality footprint.\n\nLiterally all it took for me was the Gen 2 day/night cycle, blew my mind that time followed me in the game\n\nThe day/night cycle was so cool. It was just *so cozy* seeing all the building windows lit at night.\n\nHad that with tomb Raider ( Not Sure which Part). When you climbed Out of thr water and it dripped down. Fascinating\n\nIt was only thing missing was the sessions and day night cycle I think. I am hoping that the one day we will have a pokmeon game that will have it all.\n\nI used to like that the grass ruffled as you ran through it too.\n\nI spent more time than I should as a kid running through those puddles\n\nNo, you spent the exact right amount of time\n\nI feel four bots just responded to the parent comment with variations of what you said.\n\nReddit has reached a special point where it's mostly bots and highly regulated communities where people are afraid to get really crazy or passionate. \n\nI mean, new to reddit is a thing. A place you go so you can post to get karma so 90% of the site doesn't shadowban your comments. That should never have been a thing.\n\nNah dude. You spent exactly the perfect amount of time.\n\nNah brother, you spent exactly how much you should.\n\nPokemon used to do the stuff everyone wishes other games could do\n\nNow other games do the stuff everyone wishes Pokemon could do\n\n[deleted]\n\nI hope it circles back someday\n\nNot for Pokémon sadly. Company stopped caring about quality because there’s always some subset of nostalgic idiots willing to buy the new one.\n\nAnd children. And children's children.\n\nBut the worst are game journalists who grew up with Pokémon and now praise the shit out of them at every release, reporting the most minor changes as \"innovative\"\n\nThat's the thing that turned me off of the series. Every new gen had some new gimmick that was dropped instead of being iterated on. Mega evolutions? Cool! Surely they'll add new ones with each generation as this new feature becomes a core feature of the series. Right? Riiiight?\n\nThe enshitification truly began with the jump to polygons from pixel art. Not enough time allowed/spent to do it right and it's been just a continuous train wreck ever since. I don't know who to blame, whether it's Nintendo, or if Game Freak is just low key incompetent.\n\nthat and you can't just implement things on a whim anymore.\n\nremember how mew got added by one guy in the originals\n\nor how late in development optimization in memory on the cardtridge allowed kanto to be added in full in johto\n\nyeah can't do that no more because of the complicated nature of big company development.\n\nits why i look to indie games nowadays, their smaller structure allows for some at whim additions even if they are abit unpolished ( not that pokemon is super polished either, but relatively speaking i suppose)\n\nI bought Sword, despite not liking Sun/Moon, because I figured I'd give them one more shot.\n\nI beat the league, but didn't really do any post-game content, and when I botched transferring to a new Switch and lost my save, I didn't bother replaying it.\n\nDidn't buy Scarlet or Violet.\n\nI did enjoy Arceus though!\n\nI found there was nothing to do in the post-game in Sword/Shield unless you got the DLC.\n\nI played the CRAP out of Ruby after I beat it, though. Slowly leveling my pokemon to 100 and getting them their contest ribbons.\n\n\"Safety is the death of innovation\"\n\nI really think the series should have stayed 2D. Or at most 2.5d.\n\nI think the graphics peaked in gen 5. Black/White where there's a mix of 2D and 3D, and the 2D sprites were all animated.\n\nThose graphics don't feel outdated because they had  a certain charm to them, same goes for the even older gens. I feel like that charm was lost at some point.\n\nThe transition to 3D has not been kind to many pokemon.\n\n[deleted]\n\n99% of the new pokemon being smooth and round doesn't help. Some gen 1/2 pokemon had shapes and detailing that they will just never do again because they're too lazy to model it in 3d. And they want everything to be easily made into a plushie.\n\nWhen I played the Switch pokemon snap game, I feel like THAT is what pokemon games of the most recent gens have been missing all this time. Seeing all of the pokemon as if they were actually in the wild was such an amazing experience. It blew away all the recent gens in my opinion\n\nPeak 3D is GameCube era for Pokémon 🤷🏾‍♂️\n\nPlus the whole sky battles thing ruined the battle sprites for so many mons. They used to be more expressive and now they are just static\n\nHow would you feel if the 3d [was like this fan art of mine](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/pokemon-firered-players-room-b23b6b253207463c97db2a7092adff74)?\n\nIn my opinion, Pokemon is a thousand times better with pixel art or simplistic art!\n\nThat would actually be pretty great. I can totally see that used for a faithful remake.\n\nPokémon doesn't need to have highly detailed graphics, it never did. A strong artstyle makes more than up for that.\n\nOctopath traveller is what pokemon had to be. Too bad the core mechanics of octopath were so boring.\n\nStrong disagree. The peak is above. Gen 3 had a mix of awesome sprites and beautiful overworld. Everything after that is an artistic dump imho\n\nTo each their own. Gen 3 is quite pretty indeed.\n\nI thought it looked like shit personally. Mainly the semi 3d part, the sprite work was great. Should've stayed full 2d\n\nAgreed. Either commit to 3D or stay in 2D where you have a winning formula. No one is asking for pokemon to have award-winning graphics but once they made the switch all the models looked awful. Gen 5 sprites are so much better than some current ones still.\n\nThat would be accepting their inability to make a modern game. I'd rather they had the ability to make a modern game.\n\nMainline Pokémon games should never have left 2D ,Pokémon game art can get realy good looking as shown by fan games,they should ve only done 3d games for once in a generation games along the lines of Legends arceus but with way more development,too bad this Will never happen,meanwhile palworld selling a shit ton as a new IP doing exactly that\n\nI don't agree. Pokemons graphics on GBA look pretty simple compared to other GBA games like for example Golden Sun which was released two years earlier. \nPokemon games graphics werent bad in the Gameboy and DS era, but they also weren't anything to write home about.\n\nYeah, this weird revisionism that Pokemon games were graphically superior to other games is insane. They were nice to look at, but there were always games that looked dramatically better on GB-GBA even before Pokemon came out.\n\nBest comment here\n\nBlew my mind as a kid, to have reflections and footsteps left in the sand in a game on a freaking Gameboy of all things.\n\nMost memorable Pokémon game of my childhood. I remember using the manual of the game to decipher the morse codes to get the legendary rock Pokémon.\n\nGood times.\n\nIt was braille wasn't it?\n\nYes. It was a series of stone monuments in an ocean cave, with braille on them.\n\nOnly blind kids know for sure\n\nAre you not from NA by any chance? I was confused and thought I didn’t read my manual correctly as a child so I looked it up and learned only NA didn’t include Braille in the game manual while every other region did.\n\nProbably one of my happiest moment as a kid though was randomly looking up what the heck “Braille” meant on a dictionary in the library and it included the chart. It felt like I struck gold. I was jumping with joy while copying the chart down, then I deciphered it and sent the decryption to all my friends.\n\nI remember getting phone calls from friends during Gold and Silver because a lot of us still didn't have home internet. How do you move Snorlax? How do you get Umbreon? How do I get Politoad?(Still one of my favs)\n\nBack before the day-0 spoiler culture \"how to get the most legendary {thing}!\" articles\n\n\ngood times\n\nGuys there’s a triforce underneath the ice in Zora’s Domain, trust me\n\nWe didn't even have gameboy in my country so I played all these Pokemon games on an emulator on my computer (I thought these were PC games lol) and us kids in school would discuss about the specific steps you needed to catch missingno or mew/mewtoo.\n\nThere was no certainty, no proof, it was just rumors that you had to try and see if they were correct. \n\nLife without Internet had its own magic\n\nI remember being so hyped for Gold and Silver, playing 50% English translated roms\n\nOh that’s even more satisfying! I’m from Europe so we did have it included on the manual.\n\nI remember writing down each letter in elementary. Pretty sure my parents thought it was for some more wholesome purpose.\n\nThere is nothing more wholesome than a kid making beautiful memories.\n\nBro the manual had braille? I had to go to the library and ask for a book. I felt like a scholar. Coolest thing I've ever had to do to accomplish something in a video game. I wasn't even mad. Now I'd just google it.\n\nthat big green game guide was amazing at the time\n\n*My face is reflected in the water. It's a shining grin full of hope... Or maybe it's a look of somber silence struggling with fear... What do you see in your face?*\n\n[removed]\n\nIt was insane how much new stuff there was compared to the previous games. And how it was still full and polished. I honestly feel sad for pokemon fans that still buy the new games. It must suck so hard to have a game that gets less improved than fucking Fifa.\n\n[removed]\n\nHGSS came out right after Platinum and were AMAZING. I think Pokemon continued to be a very strong gaming franchise up through Gen VI and even VII. Gen VIII was really when Pokemon took a sudden nosedive imo, though it coincided with insanely good sales, so...\n\nI sunk 600+ hours into that bad boi, the days when you only owned a couple of games and a gba\n\nCrystal and then Emerald for me.\n\nIt was crazy how at that time they had to be technically extremely creative in order to render stuff.\n\nThis was kind of the case for most games in the first few decades. I remember reading about how Crash Bandicoot could only be made to fit on a disc by basically doing a randomised compression algorithm and running it over and over again until they get lucky enough for it to fit. Then a designer would move a crate one pixel to the left and they'd have to rerun it from scratch, praying that they could make it fit again.\n\nThere's a great video on this with Andy Gavin the creator.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izxXGuVL21o\n\nThe TL;DW is that he talks about a lot of the tricks they used, including hijacking extra memory from the Playstation itself in order to make it all work.\n\nYeah I've seen this one (the whole series is great) but my white whale is the written version of this story. I read it years ago and it really stuck with me, but I haven't been able to track down that exact version again.\n\nI remember reading that version too. It could be this one. It's from Andy's personal blog. \n\n* https://all-things-andy-gavin.com/video-games/making-crash/\n\nThats crazy ahah\n\nI mean, RT (and a bunch of the shiny stuff in the new Unreal toolkit) is extremely technically creative, but it's more of an \"under the hood\" thing. It still takes quite a bit of effort to get good results out of it, it's just that, because it became a marketing buzzword for Nvidia, most devs just crowbar it into their engine, so you just get 10% more subjective fidelity out of it, at best. Doesn't matter, we can put the sticker on the box (or more likely, the Steam page).\n\nThere's a reason why, even after all these years, CP2077 is still the go-to showcase for RT; it's pretty much the only game on the market that was built for it, and it actually complements the neon dystopia of Night City.\n\n&gt;There's a reason why, even after all these years, CP2077 is still the go-to showcase for RT; it's pretty much the only game on the market that was built for it, and it actually complements the neon dystopia of Night City.\n\nWhich is a bit funny because Control was literally the game made to show off ray tracing. But the ray tracing in that game is really subtle and not obviously or readily noticeable in most places of the game. \n\nStill a great game and it looks great too, but yeah - no one really uses it for ray tracing benchmarking or showcasing while Cyberpunk 2077 is more or less the go-to option right now.\n\nIt's as you said; it's subtle. RT is being used in marketing as a big selling point, but it's only making a big difference with high-contrast scenery. Control, while it had some really cool environmental destruction effects, among other things, was still taking place in drab office spaces or industrial environments 90% of the time, so the RT was lost in the noise. \n\nAdd in the fact that, unless you have the RT quality cranked up to the absolute maximum (which requires top-of-the-line video cards that cost the same as a used car), it is often indistinguishable from really well placed rasterized lighting, and CP2077 ends up the only real \"contender\", because it's the game where you can't miss the difference due to all the glare and neon lights reflecting on all the chrome and everything.\n\nI've got a 4090, and Cyberpunk is one of maybe a handful of games at best that can even really put it to the test, and it's definitely the most visually stunning game.\n\nOnce you've seen one interior office window you've seen them all. \n\nThat's not a diss on the game, it's just a giant office building is not a very good way to showcase graphics\n\nIt's very interesting stuff. Some guy does [out of bound videos ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50bfj4Vfi7U) for some pokemon games, and you can see how creative the devs got.\n\nI mean, this isn’t really that crazy. It’s not ray tracing at all. How this works is just rerendering the reflected entities. Due to the extremely limited potential reflections in Pokémon, especially here, it’s also entirely possible that it’s just hard coded, or close to it.\n\nDoing a single reflection of a small space or limited assets is something really simple and been done for a long time, even in 3D. You just render an entire mirrored copy of the area and let players look at it. This is way simpler, but way more intensive than ray tracing at when scaled up.\n\nReflections have never not been cool in games\n\nHave you seen the reflections in Pokemon Scarlet/Violet?  They're pretty jank.\n\n&gt; Have you seen Pokemon Scarlet/Violet? They're pretty jank.\n\nFTFY\n\n[removed]\n\nI recently started playing old Pokémon games for the first time. They genuinely impressive, I can’t pick up my switch anymore. Fire red is better than any Pokémon game on switch.\n\nCan't wait till you get to the ds games, they're fucking amazing, especially gen 5\n\n*RAY TRACING* before it was cool \n\n\n\"RTX\" is a term invented by Nvidia (it's working i guess)\n\nThe *X* makes it cool.\n\nThanks Elon\n\nLooking into it...\n\nI wonder if Nvidia is happy that their marketing is working so well or worried that RTX might end up as a generic trademark that they can't enforce.\n\nIt's not ray tracing either. I'm pretty sure they just flip the character sprites and render them on water surfaces with some transparency.\n\nThat's super obvious\n\nWell based on the title people seem to think any reflection is rt lol\n\nThe exact way they implemented the reflections isn't obvious, but it not being ray tracing is.\n\nWrong, GBA used that technology 15 years before other games started doing it. Thanks Ningtendo\n\nYeah I remember this shit in mirrors in Duke Dukem 3D in the 90's.\n\nThese days I see RTX I think Raytheon. Then I see this post and wonder how they could've gone from making Pokemon to missiles.\n\nRayquaza tracing\n\nIf you're into pokemon games, do yourself a favor and try the fanmade games.\n\nChances are, you'll have a hard time going back to the official ones after that.\n\nEdit: Something of note regarding Pokemon Reborn, I'd advise against letting the youngest play this one since it is rather dark overall.\n\nWhat's your most highly recommended one?\n\nUnbound!\n\nPokemon Reborn\n\nEdit: it's a very good and hard game that introduces a new element to the game, fields. You'll  be tested and swapping out Pokemon constantly to build teams to move on. Most of the best Pokemon are locked to later portions to keep it competitive.\n\nReborn was one of my first pokemon fan games I ever played, absolutely loved it and the fields was a fun addition too.\n\nAnd then there's also Pokémon Rejuvenation, best fan game I ever played, world is just massive and I put in over dozens of hours. I haven't touched both reborn and rejuvenation for about 3-4 years or so but I can imagine that both updates have received significant updates from the last time I played too since they weren't finished at the time.\n\nGaia, then unbound.\n\nLastly, play emerald elite redux because the 4 abilities make everything else seem stupid.\n\nThere is also pokemon Crown, where they turned it into a cactus game.\n\nAll of these were done on hacked gba roms.\n\nI would say Pokemon Uranium. Really well designed region with a good story and a good gimmick of a new type. My favorite of the fan games!\n\nPokemon Crystal Clear is one of the best ROM hacks I've ever played. After sinking 80 hours into it, it's almost impossible to go back to regular GSC. There are some good YT videos summarizing the ROM hack, I recommend checking one out. I had a blast playing it.\n\nHave a look at \"inclement emerald\"\n\nThis one was great. As hard as you want it to be. I also really enjoyed Liquid Crystal, Perfect Crystal, Blaze Black/Volt White 2.\n\nPokemon Unbound is what you want. It's not a \"reimagining\" of any of the original games. It's not excruciatingly difficult. It's got a ton of great QOL without going overboard and the story is comparable if not better than most other Pokemon games\n\nPokémon Glazed\n\nNot fanmade but Vietnamese Crystal is goated.\n\nPokemon Azure\n\nPokemon: Too Many Types is a ton of fun if you have the old type chart memorized. It's like a gamble every time you attack to see if the move's effective or not.\n\nhttp://pokerogue.net is a free online roguelike that's been growing a lot the past couple months. You endlessly battle (no overworld) and build up a team until you lose.\n\nWhy would I want to play a Pokemon game without cities and places to go, the battling's the worst part lol\n\nGo, Pikachu!\n\nGoing even further back on little details like this: Tales of Phantasia actually did this way back on the SNES. Granted, the greater West didn't get to see it until the GBA days when we finally got it officially.\n\nI remember I played a fan translation of that in my teens. Such an amazing game, and graphics for the SNES. I remember one scene in a cathedral with 3d over layed lightning and some other effects used by the fx chip.\n\nThere is an NES game called [Battle of Olympus](https://portal.33bits.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/The-Battle-of-Olympus-6.jpg) that has a fight against an invisible enemy where you have to rely on your shadow.  I never played in the 80s, but that scene stayed in my head for decades.\n\nTales series is such an unsung hero in the RPG world.\n\nLmao dude. I remember thinking the reflections in the water were so advanced.\n\nPokemon at its absolute peak. All downhill from here.\n\nIt was good up to the 6th gen. Mega evolutions should have continued from then on. Instead, they keep making new gen exclusive gimmicks.\n\nMegas are the most overrated mechanic.\n\nTHey make the good Pokemon Broken and if you don't use those pokemon you're missing out\n\nNah, I loved gen 3 and it holds a lot of nostalgia for me but the series peaked at gen 5. Then Game Freak had to figure out how to make fully 3D games and to this day they still haven't quite figured it out.\n\nWas gen 5 the HGSS/ Platinum gen? Because that was easily the best. Even if diamond and pearl haven’t aged the best they were *so* hyped for their time\n\nYou're thinking of 4. It had the best mythology imo. \n\nI think people like 5 primarily for it's story? Not sure, I never played it fully. I never liked its pokemons that much so I stopped.\n\n&gt;I think people like 5 primarily for it's story?\n\nPeople like 5 because the game honestly feels like something that could come out today unchanged with how much content it has, from the simplest stuff like daily events and a side quest system that can be played with friends (which pokemon does in a very bare bones way nowadays) to the bigger stuff like being able to fight every single gym leader and champion the franchise had so far with brand new and improved teams and a whole other half of the region to explore after you're done with the game.\n\nAnd that's without considering all the small little details that just show how much love the devs put in the game like how every town has an NPC that when spoken to will begin playing an instrument that will slightly change the music of the town you're currently in.\n\nFor anyone who's interested to know just how much content this game has I definitely recommend checking out Chuggaaconroy videos about it, it's like over 80 videos of BW plus another 100 for B2W2 which just from numbers alone should tell how much stuff they managed to squeeze into a tiny little DS cartridge\n\nMy heart my agree, my brain knows 4 and specially 5 were great too\n\nYou can do reflections without raytracing. They existed before. Duke Nukem 3D did it.\n\nI think that's the joke.\n\nI remember reading about how it was a really limiting factor for level design cos they couldn't build doorways/rooms behind the mirror\n\nI think these are the only Pokémon games to run at 60FPS, as well. Game Freak's modern titles are lucky if they can hold 30FPS.\n\nThe jump in graphics and quality of life features (running, PC box organization, each pokemon having their own distinct party sprite) in Ruby/Sapphire is part of why it was my favorite Pokemon generation as a kid. It was everything I ever wanted.\n\nI watched the opening to emerald recently. Wow. They knew what they had.\n\nI don't think you know what RTX is\n\nReflection != rtx\n\nDon't know why this is downvoted, this isn't ray tracing, just a 2d sprite mirrored and some color filtering.\n\nLol I remember falling in love with this stuff as a kid\n\nThe ones on Mario 64 mirror and Star Fox 64 water blew my mind at the time\n\nas a kid this was some revolutionary stuff, still looks amazing even today.\n\n3D games like Tony Hawk were similarly doing this by having a duplicate model beneath a surface.\n\nPokemon peaked with emerald\n\nBruh I started playing emerald a few months ago and the water is the best part of the game 199%\n\nThat shit blew my mind back then for legitimately no reason.\n\nWe never forget the classics!"

    "all_comment_text": "[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRBgcvMHqU8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRBgcvMHqU8) found the video.\n\nSuch a small channel too. OP really should have posted the source.\n\nI like the Wendigo sounds, but they should’ve had The Rainbow Connection slowed down play in the background at times for max creepy factor\n\n[removed]\n\nSame here. I'd also like a SFW version of this mod. I get most gamers are horn dogs but at least put some pants on Kermit....\n\nThat is the SFW version! In the NSFW one you can see his massive cucumber swinging around.\n\nThe wendigo doesn't have pants on either, so it's lore accurate.\n\nThat is a work of art..If it only had Kermit sounds too :P\n\nI like the Wendigo croaking better lmao. It's so fitting.\n\nI want to add them at somepoint in the future, its just at the moment Until Dawns soundfiles are a jumbled unlabled mess it could take months to decode what each of them are. Once this is done I definitely want to add some kermit lines like \"it aint easy being green\"\n\nHilarious and terrifying\n\nHilarifying.\n\nOH NO. KERMIT CRAWLING ON THE WALLS IS A NEW NIGHTMARE.\n\nMy only disapointment in this is it doesn't sound like Kermit as well.\n\nDid they remove all the music that played in those tense scenes? Really strange hearing it that quiet.\n\nI feel like 99% of music is copyrighted by predators, so it's safer to just turn music to 0 than risk losing the channel or the video or whatever\n\nIt isn't just music that can be copyright claimed, but sound effects as well. The fun part is when they claim any revenue from the video and/or add ads to the video if there weren't any.\n\nIt's kind of fun to watch streamers panic as they shut off car radios in games. Like it seems minor, but if they don't pull that off, they're screwed.\n\nIt's a real life QTE!\n\nI am always amazed by modders and their creativity.\n\nWait how did they live?  They kept going outside of the oval over and over when Kermit was right next to them\n\nThey're playing with the alternate control scheme, which was made for keyboard players or controllers lacking the motion sensor.\n\nBasically, the rectangle moves out of the outline on its own, and you have a second or two to nudge it back within the outline before the QTE fails.\n\nThe original hold the controller still variant is still in the game, of course, this is just an an accessibility alternative.\n\nOh hah, that makes sense.  At first I thought they were deliberately trying to get Kermit to kill them\n\nIt's the dramatic lighting on Kermit that does it for me lmao\n\nTaking a horror scene and making exactly 1 element silly just makes it that much funnier.\n\nKermit's expressing some serious existential dread here!\n\n\"AM I THE FROG? Or just A frog?\"\n\nWhat if it is actually easy bein' green?\n\nFive Nights at Freddy's vibes.\n\nWe've gone too far.\n\nSkyrim Thomas the Train mod.\n\nThat's just too much for me. C'mon Masterchief, let's GTFOH\n\nIs that a dunkey quote?\n\nI do not watch Dunkey because he is black\n\nI am really stoned right now.\n\nI actually thought Dunkey was black for a long time, but he isn't, but I can't tell if you are being serious or not I am going to bed.\n\nYour comment broke me.\n\nIt's from a Dunkey video where he's quoting a comment Jontron left.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6uTKPwVnNI\n\nHaha that's actually a quote from the Dunkman himself\n\n'Tis\n\nAm I even exist??\n\nAs seen in the youtube classic [Ultimate Skyrim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6yHoSvrTss)\n\n... what the fuck did I just watch?\n\nYou just watched the best version of skyrim, directors cut, how it is intended to be played. Rated M for Maybe most ages or maybe just some.\n\nSkyrim My Little Pony mod.\n\nSkyrim Randy Savage mod.\n\nWar thunder My Little Pony event\n\nWe haven't gone far enough\n\nI will not be satisfied until we have every character replaced with Muppets\n\nI’d play the shit out of this game with this mod. \n\nImagine the scene where Mike goes through the sanatorium lol. A chase scene with a bunch of muppets would be hilarious.\n\nI respectfully disagree.\n\nNo this is amazing. Replace the xenomorph with Ms. Piggy next.\n\nThis is just right\n\nWe havent gone far enough.\n\n[deleted]\n\n[Frogs 100% would eat people if they were big enough.](https://media.tenor.com/z9y2PNY8MxEAAAAM/frog-frogs.gif)\n\nI feel like you could say this for a number of animals lol like house cats\n\nThat’s why I’m not worried about eating meat. They’d eat me too if they were able.\n\nMeat eater here too, this is somewhat flawed logic though.\n\nThere are quite a few animals that absolutely could hunt humans but dont, many species of bears for example basically never attack humans. \n\nThere are also many aquatic species that absolutely could hunt and kill humans, but they dont.\n\nAnimals that could attack us but dont is how we got dogs.\n\nWhat bears do you think don't hurt humans? Even black bears kill and eat humans on occasion, despite their reputation. And you said \"many species\"\n\nI can only think of pandas\n\nOnly polar bears really \"hunt\" humans, every other species is at best opportunistic or desperate, but especially black bears rarely display any hostile intent. \n\nIts true of course that *some* black bears still do it, and Im not claiming interacting with wild animals isnt incredibly dangerous, but judging the entire species based on what a minority of them does, as you said, on \"occasion\", seems a bit unfair. \n\nUnder those conditions, humanity would be the most insanely evil species to ever exist (which technically probably isnt wrong), and everybody would share blame for that equally. \n\n\nFrom a self-preservation perspective it makes sense to treat all dangerous things the same, but from a scientific or moral perspective, all the individual animals that *could* hunt humans but dont, should be considered separate, the same way we treat humans that kill humans separately. \n\nIf anything, humans even have a huge advantage in their attempts to be more peaceful due to society and education, wild animals only really have instincts and inherent intelligence to rely on.\n\nOr in short, not all animals are the same, even within the same species, same as people.\n\n&gt; There are quite a few animals that absolutely could hunt humans but dont, \n\nCorrection: There are quite a few animals that could hunt humans, but get absolutely massacred when they try it.\n\n&gt; There are also many aquatic species that absolutely could hunt and kill humans, but they dont.\n\nWe're pretty lucky that orcas don't like the taste of human meat, or they'd pack hunt our boats for snacks.\n\nDont think thats the reason tbh, most Orcas (like basically all actually) never even tried human meat.\n\nI was being facetious, I have no idea why orcas don't hunt humans, but we'd be fucked out there if they did. XD\n\nEh, I feel like it would go the way of the Tiger. \n\nAnimals that used to hunt humans \"conveniently\" gradually disappeared, or are near extinction now.\n\nMmmm, I don't know, tigers inhabit terrain that is penetrable by humans, orcas inhabit terrain that humans have a hard time getting to. They're also way, *way* smarter than tigers, can set traps and pack hunt. Might hunt them to extinction eventually but it wouldn't be as easy as a medium-sized land species.\n\nYou know they would get hunted down if they did that, so its basically the other way around, they are lucky they dont like to eat us.\n\n[deleted]\n\n&gt; And also a bear killing you to survive is not really evil\n\nIt's stupid, he'll just be hungry again in an hour\n\nObligatory course at Bovine University:\n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=JAxjqAfwfyI\n\nTigers exist\n\nCare to back that up with a source?\n\nshit you got me\n\nLike they have one.\n\nKhajiit will not devour your flesh if you have coin...\n\nIt doesn't even stop them for trying now!\n\nTo be fair, frogs pretty much try to eat anything that moves which they can fit in their mouths. Amongst which, other frogs are very much on the menu.\n\nDamned Gitrog Monster.\n\nAgreed. Just look at the [Gitrog Monster!](https://cards.scryfall.io/large/front/5/7/5790dd89-2be5-4a77-9450-2d3c1422bfc9.jpg?1576385351)\n\nTell me there's audio with little Kermity \"hnmm, yar... hmmm\" sounds\n\nUnfortunately it just makes wendigo noises\n\nGo on, say it. Tell me again about how its so easy being green! I DARE YOU!\n\nWhy isn't there a horror game with Kermit yet ahaha\n\nWhile not strictly Kermit, there is a survival horror game that's strongly inspired by The Muppets and Sesame Steet. It's called My Friendly Neighbourhood, and it's made by Evan Szymanski and John \"Ducky\" Szymanski, brothers of DUSK developer David Szymanski.\n\nCurrently, all three brothers are working on \"Secret Agent Wizard Boy\", which is sort of like those Harry Potter games except with a touch of chaos a'la Goat Simulator.\n\nDoes Poppy's Playtime count\n\nI don't know enough about that game to compare it to those classic puppet shows, but I am aware of mascot horror. I know about FNAF (who doesn't, nowadays?) and that Garten of BanBan nonsense (mainly through Mandalore trying to see if those games actually mean anything), and also Choo-Choo Charles, but I wouldn't say that those fall into the Sesame Street/Muppets (let's call it \"Muppet style\", since \"SesaMuppet style\" doesn't work as well as I hoped) category of mascot horror. MFN totally does, though.\n\nAlso, if you want to experience Muppet-style mascot horror as a beautiful slow-burn, check out the unfiction series \"Welcome Home\". Seriously, Welcome Home is beautiful and charming in its presentation of its characters in their own little neighbourhood, but it of course has that underlying darkness where things aren't quite right. At first the darkness involves the mystery of why such a delightful show became lost media, but slowly that darkness starts to creep into the media itself.\n\nI'm not going to go any deeper into it, even though I would love to, because you gotta experience this art for yourself. Whether you dig into the website on your own (it has elements of ARG to it), or explore it vicariously with Nick Nocturne at the helm (he can steer you through the ARG if you don't wanna sail those waters), you need to experience this sumptuous slow-burn and revel in the delightful performances. Because when the darkness starts to seep in to the neighbourhood, and things start getting strange, the performances shine even brighter than they did during the more grounded snippets that came before.\n\nLook up Maurice: In The Predator's Nest on steam  \ntheirs some funny YouTube videos out there of people playing it.\n\nThis is somehow more terrifying than the unmodded Wendigo.\n\nHe's gonna Kermit a crime.\n\nThis is very good\n\nInfinitely more terrifying.\n\nAs bad as replacing the Snake in Sekiro with Thomas\n\nGod I love moders\n\nThank you for letting me know it was a mod\n\nSomehow this is much worse.\n\nI wonder if there's a thomas the train mod....there has to be !\n\nI have never wanted a gif to have sound as badly as I do now\n\nDo they replace the wendigo sounds with kermit's as well? This is hilarious lol\n\nNow mod it with Kermit having a boner.\n\nNooo, not his willy\n\nSpoiler right in the title.\n\nFor an almost ten year old game.\n\nI mean The Hobbit came out in 1937 but I wouldn't spoil the ending of it to someone.\n\nHow old it is is irrelevant. And that's the kind of game where a spoiler is especially egregious.\n\nHave you played it?\n\nYeah dude I'm PISSED\n\nJust bought this yesterday and this just spoiled what's around you.\n\nKermit?\n\nWendigo. The game focuses a lot on the mystery of what's going on and who is evil. Multiple possible \"monsters\", but so far I had only seen humans so I had no idea monsters were in the game.\n\nThat and well wanting to keep a suspense horror game... Suspenseful...\n\nNow do it with CJ and big smoke!\n\nStill waiting for skyrims Thomas the train.\n\nHeeey I remember his game. I think this was the first game I got for the PS4. I was upset because I got the ending where everyone except the dark haired girl died. Great game.\n\nWhy does this actually terrify me? Must be the weed.\n\nImagine trying not to laugh and Kermit is just staring at you\n\nMaybe it's just me, but with the ridiculousness of the mod, it looks like she's trying to suppress laughter lol.\n\nThis is so much more terrifying\n\nWait, there's a wendigo in that game?!\n\nFrom HA to AH real quick\n\nArguably more terrifying\n\nIt's my birthday next Friday and I always stream for my friends and hang with them, usually streaming one of these types of  games so I can make all the wrong decisions and have a good laugh. I think I might install this mod and give this game a second play though. It'll be hilarious.\n\nSeriously, how did people unpack the files and repack them?\n\n\nI want to make subtitle translations mods for unsupported languages \n\n[removed]\n\nThe rectangle moves out of the outline on its own, and you have a second or two to nudge it back within the outline before the QTE fails. That's the version being used in the gif.\n\nThe original hold the controller still variant is still in the game on both the PC and PS5 versions. This is just an an accessibility alternative for people who don't have motion control compatible controllers, or choose not to use it.\n\nAmused, but not surprised\n\nSomeday we'll find it, the painbow connection.\n\nOMG\n\nIs this what Jurassic Park Survival is gonna be like?\n\nI love PC mods &lt;3\n\nWow\n\nThis might be the only way i play that game\n\nWhat’s a wendigo?\n\nNative American folklore I think. If you ever watched the movie \"The Ritual\" very similar to that.\n\nDoes he make Kermit sounds?\n\nXenokermit\n\nGod i love pc.\n\nHe's just making sure you drink Wilkins coffee\n\n😂😂😂\n\nWhere's me banjo, gives it back to us\n\nDamn, I really want to see the rooster teeth let's play done again but with Kermit. I feel like it would be very cool if there was a way you could record a game via the controls so it could be played again but with modifications. \n\nOh my gosh, I actually love this idea. Being able to download control commands of somebody you enjoyed the playthrough of but you can load it into your personal game with mods and watch\n\nThese are the kind of mods I need cause I’m a little bitch. No joke tho\n\nMan they suck at keeping the controller still\n\nSmii7y?\n\nYes please thank you here for active karma\n\nThanks I hate it...but it's glorious at the same time.\n\nI would watch a whole series of fully modded Until Dawn gameplay even the main characters. Like COD Waifu Advance Warfare series lol\n\nWould never have thought this was a mod without the title, thanks OP\n\nWendigo the frog here\n\nYou laugh you lose: fatal version\n\nWhen you mentioned the Cookie Monster on Hermit’s alphabet skit.\n\nPLEASE HE WAS SCREAMING AS KERMIT NOT A HOWLING SCREAM OF NIGHTMARE!\n\nOh sweet is this the DAU?\n\nOh man, someone send the mod files to SMII7Y immediately\n\nOh that will be fun when they all die\n\n(mod)\n\nPotato\n\nI wouldn't survive out there.\n\nJesus not sure but that mod makes it scarier than original model 😳\n\nSmii7y needs to play that\n\nNow do it for \"Alien: Isolation\"\n\n💀💀💀💀💀\n\nDefinitely scarier\n\nThis is pure gold lmao\n\nCan I ask. Is there already a shrek mod?\n\nOmg, I wonder what other mods they have?\n\nWTF I just saw this on my recommended on YouTube a few hours ago!\n\nTo be able to voice that\n\nHear me out…\n\nNow all we need is smi7y to play it\n\nI hear it's growl in kermits voice\n\nCJ mod when?\n\n(mod)\n\nFinally the game is scary\n\nKermit is nude. Remove this mod."

    "all_comment_text": "But why seriously horizon zero dawn didn't age that bad.\nThe remaster is not needed at all.\n\nI swear Horizon Zero Dawn released like 2 years ago\n\nYou're thinking of Forbidden West, Zero Dawn is the first game. Which is still 2 years younger than Bloodborne.\n\nWow, in my mind HZD is WAY newer, and the reason is they released it on PC so there was already a \"next gen\" upgrade to the game, while Bloodborne is still \"only\" a PS4 game that they haven't even patched to run at 60fps with no visual upgrades.\n\nYeah I played HZD 2 years ago at 100+ FPS everything maxed on my PC and it didn't look like an old game.\n\nBloodborne is still stuck at 30 fps.\n\nWell...the emulation scene on it has somehow been skyrocketing the last weeks. It went from being able to load the menu to being able to run the game at high fps (it still has a lot of issues but its amazing to see). And someone is working on a remaster project for it aswel, he already changed shadows from being baked in to actual real time shadows and he is working on full texture upscaling aswel. Sure its not there yet but we basicly almost got bloodborne PC.\n\nThe real question is where the fuck is inFamous and inFamous 2?\n\nI demand a Prototype remaster!\n\nAnd why have they left the IP dead?!\n\nBecause Ghost of Tsushima is just that fucking successful.\n\nZero Dawn is still one of the prettiest games you can play NOW. It still looks amazing and has hardly shown its age. \n\nJust fuck it, already. BB PC is the only thing were going to get until they launch BB alongside PS6 day one release.\n\nYeah, I don't think anyone but a kid could make the claim that it's an \"old\" game. I am confused at what they think they can do to make it worth the purchase. \n\nSlap the Sony logo on it and laugh all the way to the bank?\n\nThe same they're doing with the PS5 pro?\n\nI would have thought they would at least finish the trilogy before releasing this\n\nIt's still in my backlog, literally haven't gotten around to it yet. And it's already re-released.\n\nI agree it's re-releasing too quickly, but it being in your backlog seems kind of irrelevant. It released over 7 years ago, at this point it may be in your backlog forever.\n\nI played it a year ago and I thought the graphics were pretty amazing. Not sure what a remastered is looking to add…\n\nI played it a few weeks ago and it looks great, doesn’t need a remaster.\n\nI played it yestrerday and was impressed it still looks good compared to a few weeks ago.\n\nCan we get weekly updates on whether it still looks good?\n\nI played it a few minutes ago and it looks great, doesn’t need a remaster.\n\nThere's not even the excuse of updating things for a PC port that past remasters and remakes that felt pointless had. Sure it'll probably look a bit better but it really doesn't need an improvement.\n\nIt’s so they can sell you the same game another time with minimal added cost on their end. That’s why lol. If that wasn’t the reason then they’d just release a free update with HD textures and lighting effects for ps5.\n\nIt hasn't aged at all.  The days of doubling graphics are over\n\nAssassin's Creed Odyssey was just tweaked up a little for PS5 and it's a joy to behold. Why can't this be done for HZD? I don't understand the need, apart from making more money from people who already own the game.\n\n\nBloodborne is in dire need of a remaster, more than any other game from the PS4 generation. \n\n&gt;Bloodborne is in dire need of a remaster, more than any other game from the PS4 generation.\n\nSony put a Bloodborne reference on their other first party title (Poems in GOW Ranarok, Hunter Bot in Astro Bot) but aren't willing to do anything with the actual game. \n\nIt didn't even have any PS4 Pro upgrade, and it was one of the first major PS4 killer app, a big reason to own the console.\n\nSeriously their attitude with the game is frankly baffling at this point.\n\nI jokingly called my PS4 my Bloodborne machine, which was replaced by my Demon's Souls Remake/Bloodborne machine.\n\nI have no reason to get a PS6 unless a Bloodborne 2 or a remaster are launch titles; so much of Sony's stuff is coming to PC now, and I imagine that trend will only continue.\n\nYeah BB is the Main reason i keep my PS4.\n\nI have the Bloodborne strategy Guide exclusive Themen since day 1 and never changed it and thats another reason why i dont want to give Up my ps4\n\nI’m shocked there hasn’t been a BB2 announcement. The console’s been out for a few years, but nothing.\n\nWhat did Bloodborne do to Sony that all it gets is references in other games?\n\nBloodborne, GoW, and HZD are all referenced in Ghost of Tsushima too\n\nEasy $ grab, that's all this stage of capitalism can bank on. Minimum effort for any gain. Late stage baby! Let it burn\n\nWe can blame the companies wanting to do less effort for more money, but people buy these remasters every time.\n\nThis age of remasters that nobody asks for is so disappointing\n\nI want full on remakes of old games that actually need that upgrade. Remastering a 7 year old game ( especially when the remaster is just adding 4k textures and bumping up the price tag ) is pointless.\n\nI completely agree, remakes built from the ground up can be pretty great. Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1+2 is just one that comes to mind for me.\n\nRE remake series, FFVII,shadow of colossus, crash team racing,spyro trilogy and crash trilogy comes to my mind.\n\nNight Dive's System Shock remake was great. The original was the granddaddy to so many great games like the BioShock series, but it was a DOS game. So yeah, it really needed one.\n\nGotta throw in black mesa as well.\n\nHalf Life 2 aged so well, I was able to really enjoy it more than a decade after it's release and it's still enjoyable to this day. HL1 in comparison  feels like it's way older in comparison, so yeah Black Mesa is such a cool project bringing it up to more modern standards. Source engine in general is ageless\n\nAnd Mario RPG\n\nNintendo released some nice remastered versions of OOT and majora’s mask on the 3ds. Shame they never ported them to switch\n\nThey also did some beautiful remasters of Wind Waker and Twilight Princess on the Wii U. And I'm only a little annoyed those never made it to the Switch. That version of Wind Waker comes with a few really nice quality of life improvements that make the endgame in particular a lot less tedious. \n\nThere is a great remaster of Skyward Sword on the Switch though. Didn't do too much to the textures, but that game was always gorgeous. The resolution bump is all it really needed. And the ability to play it without magic wand controls makes me actually wanna play that game.\n\nI really don't understand why they don't bring those Zelda games to the Switch. \n\nI'd buy the 3DS texured OoT/Majoras Mask and Wind Waker, Twilight Princess in a heartbeat.\n\nI need them to do FFX so we can play Blitzball next gen.\n\nIdk if I can count ff7 there. It's less of a remake and more of a sequel.\n\nThere's also the advance wars and another code 1+2 bundles (nintendo exclusive) that came out recently that I felt deserve a mention in this thread\n\nIt's so dumb that THPS3+4 was canceled because Activision wanted to focus on Call of Duty.  3 and 4 were my young adult life for a couple of years.  Ah well...\n\nTony Hawk did announce last week that he has been talking with Activision about a new project, but hasn't revealed if it's a remaster of old games or a completely new game.\n\nWe need a THUG or American Wasteland remake\n\n*Everyone is someone in L.A.*\n\nOh man thps3 was the best. The level \"Canada\" was amazing. You may remember but it had two vert ramps with two rails in between them. It also was the first game to allow a revert into a manual after you landed on a vert ramp. Which meant you could in theory countinue one combo forever. Little me would spend sometimes an entire hour or more stringing together a singular combo worth 50 million+ of points. I also remember fucking up quite a few times after having spent 30+ minutes on a run, feeling absolutely demolished, hitting start right away to hit retry, and was off blasting another endless combo. \n\nOh to be a young preteenager again lol\n\nMan, I loved playing 3 and 4 when I was a teen. I never owned either of them though, would always play them whenever I visited my cousin.\n\nSeriously, playing through Persona 3 Reload and its a fantastic remake so far. Hope to play FF7 Remake soon as well. These high-res texture remasters are pointless.\n\nGive us a infamous remake, crimson skies, fuckin hell, remake both half life games on source 2.\n\nI came here to say inFAMOUS. That and shadow of the colossus were my favorite games as a kid and I would do anything for bluepoint to remake inFAMOUS like they did with SOTC and Demons Souls\n\nWas literally just talking to a buddy yesterday about how I'd kill for an infamous second son remake, or just another entry in the series.\n\nAnd those PS2 lord of the rings games too!\n\nMy wife, a friend and I would couch co-op the shit out of that!\n\nWe are currently on our 9th playthrough of War In The North.\n\nCrimson Skies was a gem.\n\nYou mean something like a remaster of The Resistance trilogy?\n\nLoved the creepy feeling of the first and second especially.\n\nCapcom does remasters and remakes better than anyone else I've seen. Even the AA remasters are complete rewrites of the entire games with updated HD art, and the Investigations remaster has straight up completely redrawn sprites and a new soundtrack. Then there's the RE remakes, and the new Dead Rising remaster looks pretty good, too - it looks like they remade everything there too.\n\nWish they would do a viewtiful Joe one\n\nRemake the infamous games? Best I can do is TLOU2 and Horizon lol\n\nYet KOTOR remains in remaster purgatory\n\nThe studio that are working on it recently received investment &amp; have it listed as a game they are working on, so there's still some hope.\n\n\nInterestingly they only called it \"Knights of the Old Republic\" rather than adding remake or similar to it. \n\nFor real. I think the absolute limit for remasters is the Xbox 360 era and below. Even the 360 era is pushing it, as most of those games have PC releases that look just fine.\n\nThis age is indeed tainted with the greed of men. Boots you into a pit….\n\nNo we are asking for remasters. Bloodborne remaster\n\nAll I want is pc port. Remaster or not\n\n If Bloodborne is ported to PC just as is, you can bet modders are gonna go to town on it. Remaster or not. AI enhanced textures, QoL improvement, new movesets, the works. Ever since Sony started porting their previous games over to PC, people have been asking for Bloodborne. Like I legit thought that after their big first party games, Bloodborne would be the best one to port over. If they're gonna freakin' remaster Zero Dawn, which nobody asked for, then we can forget about getting Bloodborne on PC.\n\nWell that one I get lol. There are a handful of games that people simply want a better framerate/resolution\n\nIt really seems like such a huge waste of dev time.\n\nEvery person who has bought a remastered game has asked for it\n\nMate this has been happening for a decade.\n\n\nPS3 The Last of Us 1 and then barely a year later the remaster for the PS4. Dark Souls 2 had Scholar of the First Sin remaster, Skyrim, Far Cry 1, God of War 1-3, etc.\n\nEven that wasn't as egregious cuz there was no backwards compatibility on PS4, this is insane because the PS5 will already play PS4 games in boost mode\n\nIm genuinely sad about this. Remaster of a game that's not even a decade old yet\n\nHZD is what, 6 years old?  We’re remastering games that aren’t even a single generation gone now?\n\nI don't think it's necessary but relative age isn't a major factor, it is for all intents and purposes a port with enhancements. Resident Evil for instance used to do this all the time back in the day, they just didn't call them remasters. It's also a way to give employees something to do when they aren't yet needed on the studios next project, or even to familiarize staff with their engine/PS5.\n\nI'm not going to buy it because I don't think it needs the update but this isn't a new thing.\n\nThey are calling it a remaster so they can sell it again. Meanwhile, Fallout 4 just updates the game.\n\nSkyrim: 👀\n\nBethesda gave skyrim Special Edition for free for people who owned the original with the dlcs on Steam in 2016. I know cause I was one of them.\n\nDamn I only played Skyrim on pc after special edition released, besides that I’ve also purchased it on ps3, ps4, ps5 upgrade, and switch lol. I remember when I bought portal for ps3(?) it had a free steam key along with it but I guess it being a valve game that makes sense.\n\n*GTAV enters the chat*\n\n7 years \n\nRelease date was in february 2017 so it is in fact closing in on its 8th birthday. Still don't personally believe a remaster is necessary at all.\n\nIt came out on PS4 hardware, and is primarily a Sony console game. Even though it had a quick PS5 patch that made it look better, it has a lot of room for improvement on PS5 hardware, and especially PS5 Pro. I agree it doesn't make as much sense for PC, but as a PS4 to PS5 update it makes more sense.\n\nBloodborne is going to be a launch title for PS6 so that Sony can sell soulsborne fans the next gen console. The same way they already did with Demon souls this gen\n\nDude if they do a full blown Bloodborne remake that looks as good as Demon Souls, I’ll buy that damn console day one.\n\nexactly :(\n\nWhat if it still runs at 30 fps? 💀\n\n*pls no*\n\nIt runs at 60 fps 60% of the time (40% odds of crashing every second)\n\nThey had performance mode for Demon’s souls. You’ll be fine\n\nGod it worked on me. I had it day one for DS.\n\nDemon’s Souls being remade made sense. It was a very old game stuck on a console not easily emulated. It was also a way to get everyone who jumped in from the Dark Souls craze to get a chance to play GrandDaddy Souls.\n\nIt actually emulates pretty well. You can even play online\n\nDays Gone remaster coming next. So fucking pointless\n\nThe Last of Us Part 1 Remake Remaster coming in 4 years\n\nI'd rather have Days Gone 2 or something. I absolutely love Days Gone but it clearly doesn't need a remaster because it still looks beautiful to this date in my eyes\n\nIf the remaster was a Director's Cut that included cut content, I'd buy it.\n\nSome cut content includes:\n\n• Cut story decisions during major events (scene a few times in early preview demos - final game always chooses the \"good\" option)  \n• Boozer morale system (would be influenced on said story decisions)  \n• camp jobs from Boozer (from Chapter 1)  \n• cut mission from Copeland, learning about his scars and tracking down/kill the Rager Bear   \n• each camp merchant (Freaker ear collectors) having a 1-2 job storyline  \n• cut mission near the end where you'd ride the bus, manning an armed machine gun gunning down bad guys as you drive to the final mission area (removed due to the devs feeling it was too \"arcade-like\")  \n• cut zone known as Pinnacles that featured 5-6 story missions, had it's own camp site in a stadium with a coach as their leader  \n• weapons such as a minigun and flamethrower  \n• being able to do to wheelies\n\nI thought sony wasn't happy with Days Gone sales or something? Weird of them to remaster a cancelled series.\n\nDayz Gone can be good, not because it needs it, the game is pretty good for what it is right now, but to get more sales and let publisher knows that people have interest in this game and franchise\n\nThe game already sold something like 9 million copies across it's lifetime, and the developers have recently come out and said they have no real interest in continuing with the IP, mostly because the director is a complete fucking tool and impossible to work with.\n\nYeah but I've never heard of anyone before this NOT playing it because they were waiting for a better version. If they made it a free update they'd get more sales but charging for a remaster isn't going to bring in the numbers.  The game is great, I loved it. I'd 100% play again if it was a free ps5 update.... but paying again? Nah.\n\ndon't worry, bloodborne will be released on pc\n\nright after silksong\n\nHeard it was one week after Half-Alice 3 comes out.\n\nValve/American McGee crossover?\n\nBro don't make me cry\n\nAt this point it looks like the emulation will be sufficient quality for a “port” before it gets an official real port\n\nit's almost fully playable on PC already\n\nis bloodborne even real? \n\ndo we keep asking for remake, sequel or pc port from sony of a game that didn't even exist?\n\ndid we really played at all?\n\nThat'd be the most Bloodborne thing ever if the game never existed and we just dreamed it up\n\nA game is a game, even in a dream\n\nRise and shine mr hunter, rise and smell the ashes\n\nNOT to.. imply you've been... Sleeping on the hunt.\n\n[deleted]\n\nMoney\n\nThe price\n\nI've played Horizon on PC recently and it looks amazing, why do a remaster of a game which still is amazing?\n\n[deleted]\n\nTo force people who plan on buying the Pro, but whom already own a disc version of H:ZD, to \"upgrade\" In short it's almost a scam.\n\nI remember when gamers looked forward to new games instead of rereleases and remasters.\n\nAs someone who just recently got into Soulslikes, rereleasing Bloodborne on PC would be awesome. I'd love to give that a try.\n\nIsnt that just releasing though and not rereleasing, Bloodborne hasnt been on pc right?\n\nKind of, except that's going to take so much work that you might as well put in a bit more work to make it 60fps, and suddenly it's a remaster.\n\nr/bloodbornepc would like a word...\n\nOne day you shall play Bloodborne on PC it may cost you 60$ or be free but thats for Sony (if they actually enjoyed money) to decide\n\nAt this point Sony should just come out and say why the lack of Bloodborne. If it's technical issues, they should just say.\n\nIt's a contractual issue for sure. Probably something along the lines of them having to cut a check or a vig to From even if all the work is done by Bluepoint.\n\nI think I’d die if bluepoint did Bloodborne like demon souls. I’d just die\n\nWould Sony even have an answer? FromSoft is the developer, no?\n\nFromSoft is the developer, but Sony owns the IP and was the publisher, and Sony's Japan Studio co-produced.\n\nThey can outsource remasters and remakes to developers like Bluepoint. Anyway, they are quite capable of talking to Fromsoft and asking for it and Fromsoft can give an answer.\n\nMiyazaki indirectly said that he would like a Bloodborne PC port by saying \"I'm not opposed to the idea\"\n\nFromsoft recently came out and said that they *can't* really do anything with it, because Sony holds the IP. They'd be more than willing to give their blessing but that's all they can do at this point. \n\nMy leading theory is that whatever codebase they had for the game got lost/destroyed/deleted when Sony shut down StudioJapan, so they literally *can't* do anything with it. But they don't want to come out and say that their most requested IP is literally gone for good\n\nEven if it were for a sequel, you're going to have to yell a lot louder in Sony's direction if y'all want Bloodborne anything. \n\nAnd right now Sony is currently seeing currency signs in the whites of their eyes from this 30th anniversary circus.\n\nHas Fromsoftware shown any interest in doing more Bloodborne stuff? Sony can do whatever they want, but if Fromsoftware doesn’t want to play, then nothing can happen.\n\nSony owns the IP. The last time someone explicitly asked miyazaki about a pc port he actually said lots of people at the office would love it. But it's not up to them. It seems like it holds a special place in their heart, and they get asked about it fairly consistently... It has to be Sony.\n\nMIYASAKI hates sequels and said he isn't interested in making anymore. However, he said he would love to return to Yharnum. So even he would like to make another one, but it's not his call. It's Sony.\n\nIt is on Sony so hard it couldn't be on Sony harder.\n\nEnough…I have suffered more than enough….\n\nOk which big AAA game will be released next to remaster this time?\n\n*For ref:* \n\n*1) Switch and Zelda BOTW came out when Zero Dawn came out.*\n\n*2) Elden Ring came out when Forbidden west came out.*\n\n*4) Forbidden West* ***PC version*** *came out day before* ***Dragons Dogma 2***\n\nHonorable mention: *Zero Dawn PC version came out month or 2 weeks after: Last of us 2, Ghost of tsushima and Doom Eternal + Animal Crossing. If that counts.*\n\n(Edited to add PC versions)\n\nThis series is cursed man, istg\n\nThere must be a reason they’re avoiding doing Bloodborne again. It was decently popular and critically well received, it doesn’t make sense to not do a sequel or remaster.\n\nThe codebase is not built on Sony's multiplat codebase, which makes even a PS4 Pro patch difficult. \n\nThere must be something, in the code, that makes it difficult to port. \n\nDue to the way consoles work, you cant just release a patch like you can on PC. Because at this time, the game has no way of knowing if its on a PS4, PS4 Pro, or PS5. \n\nFor whatever reason Sony doesnt feel like its worth it. We dont know exactly what those reasons are, but if I had to guess, the cost analysis of doing a free 60fps PS5 patch isnt worth it, and they want to save the 60fps remake for later in the PS5 lifecycle or something.\n\nIf shadps4 keeps going at the same pace, we will have playable (maybe even optimised) bloodborne on pc by the end of the year... unless sony FINALLY decides to just port the damn game to pc and get their money back from concord and then some\n\nI mean, have you looked at the progress this past week? It's already basically playable. The lighting is almost fully solved now, and you can progress the game fine.\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbEwjTl9abc\n\n\nWon't even need to be end of year, within the next month it seems like it's going to be a better experience than you get on console lmao. There's even people implementing real-time lighting mods and other enhancements.\n\nRemaster ragnarok fuck it blow my ps5 up with butt physics of kratos cheeks jiggling and 8k texture and real time path gen ray tracing.\n\nLOL Sony Execs writing this down as we speak\n\nBOY! Clap my cheeks!\n\nFuck I'd actually buy that\n\nZero dawn looks like a new game to these eyes and does not need a remaster possibly ever lmao\n\nPS6 launch title: bloodborne remake. \n\n  \nkinda sad since I have literally no interest in buying their overpriced consoles at all\n\nYou know what, go ahead and remaster it. Remaster everything. But make it like $5 for everyone who bought the original.\n\n🤣 How's the weather in Dreamland?\n\nthey did it with tlou 2, i don't see why they can't do it again\n\nHavent seen this mentioned, but this is from the bloodborne comic series. Havent read all of it but seems solid. Artwork is gorgeous though, recommend it on that alone.\n\nDays Gone is getting a remaster as well\n\nI just played the game, the graphics are great, why does it need a remaster? It just came out on  PC like 2 years ago\n\n\"We don't have any IPs!\"\n\nDidn’t Zero Dawn get a PS5 upgrade? It runs at 60 FPS right?\n\nYeah. They've done that for most of the prominent PS4 titles. They already look great and run at 60 so there's no fucking point to these PS5 'remasters'. They are literally just spinning their wheels because they have no new IP or even sequels to announce still.\n\nAt this point someone at Sony must have a grudge against Bloodborne...\n\nAt this point I have to think that there’s a reason for the lack of Bloodborne, like they lost a chunk of the original assets or something.\n\nI’m so bored of these companies remastering already gorgeous games\n\nNow Days Gone, which Sony hates, is also rumored to get a PS5 upgrade.\n\nIs bloodborne worth it if i havent played any souls game\n\nBloodborne is outstanding. It'd the only souls I liked enough to finish\n\nThe community will do what PlayStaydon't\n\nLook at the bright side, the longer bloodborne isn't released on any other system, the better the PS4 emulator gets 😉\n\npatience, dear hunters, the day will come.\n\nSurely tommorow\n\nThe question being fellow hunter who will deliver first? Sony or the internet? My money is on the internet.\n\nI mean the emulated version is coming along well, and there's no sign of anything from Sony. So I'd say that's a safe bet.\n\nEven if it does it'll require ps+ so the majority of the world can't play it anyway.\n\nIt's been almost 10 years...\n\nI really don’t get it — HZD is still _very_ competitive, technology-wise. It’s still stunning. There is a complete edition with the expansion, so it’s not even necessary to have a new bundle.\n\nEven Bloodborne doesn’t really need a remaster, just give  us a patch for 60fps on the PS5 and most of us would be happy.\n\nHZD looks stunning on PC and good on PS5, what improvements are they trying to make? 60 fps on console?\n\nWe're going to see the shadps4 release before we get an official release\n\nAh, another Sony Remaster Cash Grab\n\nALL that sane gamers want is the existing 60fps option to be flicked on. And a PS4+ port.\n\n*Looks at Infamous, Resistance, Sly Cooper, Legend of Dragoon*\n\nMaybe Sony will remember the other franchises that fans have been praying for a remake/remaster for.\n\nFor real? I literally bought this on Steam yesterday on sale to play for the first time and now they are remastering it?\n\nBut why?\n\nI liked the game and the sequel they’re pretty good but I always felt like it had much more hype around it than it deserved\n\nDon’t worry after that I’m sure we’ll get Horizon Forbidden West Remastered\n\nMost unnecessary remaster ever\n\nSony is a fucking joke right now\n\nSidebar if anybody's wondering where this comic is from, it's an official Bloodborne comic called \"The Death of Sleep\".\n\nAt this point I'm fully expecting a remaster to be released before the original game.\n\nIt's got to be a legal issue at this point. I'm calling it.\n\nThe reality is it's a relatively easy update for them to do and with PS5 Pro a easy way to show it off. \nAlso with the studio not in the middle of any major production again easier to allocate the resources to do it.  \n  \nAnd the thing I don't think people get is Bloodborne is not made by a Sony studio where Guerilla Games is. Yes it was a PlayStation exclusive but Sony and FromSoft would need to workout whatever but even then FromSoft is very busy ATM just releasing Elden Ring DLC and working on the Armored Core DLC\n\nIt's wild that with every remaster that comes out, the *entire* gaming community gets online and literally begs for a bloodborne remaster.\n\nSooner or later Sony will take the hint.\n\nAt this point I'm convinced they lost the entire source code and it would be up to Bluepoint to remake it from scratch.\n\nRemaster remaster remaster!\n\nI’m not buying any of them! \n\nGive me new games!\n\nFrom really respects players, don’t give it a second thought. They value your time and respect your intelligence.\n\nYou're missing the /s\n\nThe recent leak of Days Gone being remastered lmao.\n\nThis is fun\n\nSony hates money.\n\nStop buying remastered games of only 7 years old games."

    "all_comment_text": "High budget isn’t a replacement for creativity or knowing your audience.\n\nYeah, the big problem is people like Tim Sweeney running gaming companies when they have no clue about the industry.\n\nThey think the investors are the customer.\n\nBut they are. For him at least. He has to present more times to the people owning the money than to the people buying the product.\n\nGreat, they can all have a lovely shareholder meeting together off in Jackson Hole or wherever, but they will still struggle to get the returns they promise to the shareholders.\n\nWho gives a shit about the audience?  Can the game serve as a vehicle for recurring income with minimal development cycles?  Does the art style lend itself to Ai creation?  Can everything be offshored?  Are there any alternative revenue streams (e.g. In-game ads).\n\nMost games arent meant to be fun. They're mean to be profitable.\n\nYou're right - but what they keep missing is that a game being fun is key to it being profitable. \n\nNot if your market are gamblers, speculators and min-maxers\n\nthey won't join in unless there's people to show off to. you can market to those groups, but they require a supporting crowd of casuals to be better than - who's going to drop $10k on some in-game cosmetic if no-one's ever gonna see it and go 'wow, that's so cool!'?\n\nmaybe don't do live service/micro-transactions laden/empty open world games\n\nMy god it’s so frustrating not being able to play games I bought just because my internet sucks. I’ve been playing black ops 3 zombies lately and it’s immensely frustrating to loose all my progress and have none of it count because my internet cuts out for a few seconds. \n\nAnd micro transaction can go suck a fat one. I’m fine with dlc, even some of the more questionable ones. But as soon as they start selling an alt currency that you need to buy stuff in game and time gating normal progression I’m out. Fuck that and fuck them. There’s hundreds of games to choose from these days. I’ve been going back and playing a lot of older games lately just because I’m so sick of all the bullshit.\n\nI remember a few years ago complaining about a single player game dropping connection due to the shit internet I had at the time.\n\n  \nI was told \"Why don't you move somewhere else then?\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \nFucking WHAT.\n\na few years back when ms was attempting the greatest fumble in the history of fumbles, they announced that the xbox one would require constant internet connectivity even for single player games, to verify licensing\n\nsome people said \"hey what about people who have no or limited internet?\" \n\nand ms said \"we have a console for those people it's called the xbox 360\"\n\nAnd then they retracted that after seeing universal hate\n\nAnd fired the guy who tried to push that non sense.\n\nI'm guessing they fired the fall guy, not the entire C-suite  and board of directors who are the real people behind these terrible decisions.\n\nThey kinda did - Phil Spencer took over soon after.\n\n(&amp; look how great that worked out for them - Xbox are on top of the world!)\n\nYep it was a clever trick to let Don Mattrick take the heat but the Xbox One debacle was a team effort and most of that team stayed. In hindsight even the last years of the Xbox 360's life wasn't so great either with the excessive Kinnect push and random unwanted/unimaginative sequels (Crackdown 2, Fable 3, Halo 4). Whats-his-name Peter Moore was such a driving force behind the Xbox 360's initial success and when he left the Xbox execs coasted on his momentum until it came to a stop.   \n  \nNow they're addicted to the Game Pass bar chart and keep shooting themselves in the foot to make numbers go up at the expense of everything else.\n\n&gt; some people said \"hey what about people who have no or limited internet?\"\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; and ms said \"we have a console for those people it's called the xbox 360\"\n\nIIRC it was not even \"some people\" that asked that\nit was MS themselves in their marketing matertial saying 2Dont have internat all the time? dont worry, we have a console for that, its called the xbox 360\"\nmaking it even worse.\n\n[deleted]\n\n&gt;I’ve been going back and playing a lot of older games lately just because I’m so sick of all the bullshit.\n\nIt's so nice loading up a PS2 game and the main menu isn't asking you for more money.\n\nor a day one patch to make the thing playable.\n\nWhen I brought my PC for a week long \"vacation\" at a friend's place to chill with some games, I stared in disbelief when I saw that I couldn't launch AC Odyssey without hooking the internet up, because it had to validate the license. Like... I bought it, I installed it, their crappy *launcher* even loaded up my library after that week+ of not launching anything or the launcher itself, had the game marked as installed and ready to play, yet I couldn't launch it.\n\nThis was the moment I realized that modern gaming can truly suck massive balls.\n\nHonestly,  I'm tempted to just start pirating all the Assassins Creed games. No uplay, no internet, no expensive dlc\n\nBecause all that money isn't going towards making the best games they can make, plain and simple. They're just trying to scientifically concoct the most efficient money extraction machines, and that isn't very fun.\n\nThis. \n\nIt's less \"people don't want high budget games\" and more \"you can't throw money at a shitty game and expect it to become good only because of that\".\n\nI think the \"scientific\" part is copying the latest successful core gameplay loop OR recycling the last successful core gameplay loop your company experienced.\n\n\nShould be a sure thing, doesn't always work, because once something is stale it's no longer interesting.\n\nWell that and several companies hired behavioral psychologists to turn games into skinner boxes rather than games.\n\nThis is the real answer. Shitty games aren't shitty because they're chasing trends; they're shitty because they're C-suite wet dreams, thin veneers of a game plastered on top of a cash shop with seasons and microtransactions and skins and FOMO and loot boxes. The amount of money that they'll let you spend without giving an iota of gameplay is disgusting.\n\nI don't remember how many buggy messes I've seen in the last 10 years where the store works flawlessly. That really says almost everything you need to know.\n\nHappened early in OW2 release, game was a mess balance wise, servers kept disconnecting, some big bugs that ruined gameplay.. devs slow as hell to patch any of it. A couple weeks in the shop bugged and it was fixed in hours.\n\n[deleted]\n\n*cough *cough Ubisoft\n\nIt's pretty impressive to see a company create that successful core gameplay loop and over the next decade or so distill all the fun out of it while also oversaturating the market for it with their own variations, then be surprised when gamers who've wrung every bit of dopamine out of their IP-branded skinner boxes don't want to keep buying another one.\n\nMaking it harder to level up in an RPG only to sell normal XP rates in their single player microtransaction shop.\n\nOr have xp boosts that are impossible to turn off, bundled with the \"gold edition\" that break progression by making you level too fast.\n\nLol, that's pretty awful. I could totally see that happening. Who did that?\n\nAC Odyssey had that problem\n\ni don’t think any major video game studio other than ubisoft has done it to the point where it affects 100% of their output at this point.\n\ninsane\n\nThe problem is that the video gaming industry has gotten away from the \"video gaming\" and taken a hard turn into \"industry.\"\n\nI think we all get it here. If you put out a product you want to get paid for it. The execs are just thoroughly disconnected from the consumer base. We want good games. We want worlds you can immerse yourself into. We want gameplay mechanics that are easy to learn and difficult to master. We want turn-based games and lightweight games for when we don't have time or a lot of energy. We want shooters for killing things. We want strategy for when we're thinking. We want racing for when we have a need for speed. We want games we can play with friends and family. \n\nWe don't want to be treated like ATMs that pay out for the latest shitty alpha project that has a huge CGI budget, voice-acting by big names, and repetitive maps and missions. Build a world. Give us choices. Above all, don't treat the games we buy like you still own them once we pay.\n\nFuck you Ubisoft. Fuck you Bobby Kotick.\n\nIt's easy for private companies right now to let the artists and developers cook and create stable products, as long as they are generating revenue. With public corporate it's no longer enough to generate profit; you have to generate more and more. For this reason public companies will always have pressure to (although won't always) hyper capitalize every aspect of the gaming experience.\n\nA recent example is frostpunk 2 which generated a revenue almost instantly, but stock for the company fell b/c it didn't perform well enough in a profitability lens for the stockholders. Who the fuck cares, as a gamer? Well when a company is public there is pressure to \"have\" to care.\n\nA classic example is the subscription model of famous MMOs shifting quickly to hyper monetization once companies went public, Runescape and Wow are big examples here. They are also good examples of how consumers will accept incremental increased fees and charges and the normalization of them.\n\nWhat we want to pay attention to at this time are small developers, private companies with focus on sustainability and revenue, and to a less extent very grounded public companies of which some exist but understand that with this model of business you as the consumer are not the actual target audience, you are rather being leveraged financially to satisfy the demand for infinite profit. That means infinitely more complex ways to generate $$$ out of you.\n\nIn conclusion: since everything boils down to money, no amount of appeals will change things. These companies have a legal obligation to take as much profit from players as is possible, and the players aren't truly the focus. I know it sucks but it's actually best to stay away or at least not get invested in these companies, cause they aren't invested in you.\n\nThe stock market is the ruination of everything and the death of mankind.\n\nBut for a brief moment in time, stonks went up\n\nThey've literally been making Far Cry 3 for 14 years.\n\nholy shit\n\nit was a good game tho\n\nIt’s funny cause once every half decade or so I’ll go back and play Far Cry 2 or Far Cry 3. I don’t think I’ve played through any of the other ones more than once (I do remember liking 4 tho).\n\nThe fact that a lot of popular indie games on steam is made by devs consisting of one or two people just proves budget =/= good game.\n\n[deleted]\n\nAlso AAA games nowaday are an amalgamation of multiple mini genre and subgenre. Like those stealth portion of games, the escort part of the game, the assassin creed movement up building, driving point A to point B for exposition and plot movement  \n\nThere's no creativity and not a single good direction in those games. You can't feel the passion in it cause there's none. It's a project from a business point of view not a passion project like Terraria or Stardew Valley which still gets updated for free.\n\n&gt; Also AAA games nowaday are an amalgamation of multiple mini genre and subgenre. Like those stealth portion of games, the escort part of the game, the assassin creed movement up building, driving point A to point B for exposition and plot movement\n\nGames have had all those aspects for decades. How many mini games did the original FF7 have that was completely different to the main game. Riding in a car when escaping Midgar. Snowboarding. Sneaking into Shinra HQ. Halo had driving missions, escort missions, and you could stealth for a lot of parts. It's been a staple in gaming for decades to have some completely different gameplay mechanics sprinkled in.\n\nThe other problem is the more money that goes towards a project, the less risk it can take, which means the more boring/stale/repetitive it feels.\n\nTurns out games are largely about novelty, seeing and doing something you haven't done before. (especially big high profit low investment successes like Minecraft, Amongus, PUBG, Dota1)\n\nBut business seems to be about dumping as much money as possible into a formula you've seen work before in the hopes of replicating it's success.\n\nIt's kind of a catch-22, I suppose video games are a lot like Art. You can't hire Leonardo Da Vinci and ask him to make a yearly release of \n Mona Lisa sequels hoping that there won't be diminishing returns.\n\nThe worst thing to happen to gaming (and the rest of the entertainment industry) is the idea that every product needs to appeal to everyone. \n\nYou just end up with the most bland, generic, lowest common denominator shit.\n\nNot just gaming either. Movies and television also become worse as they try to appeal to as wide audiences as possible. Honestly any number of products made to entertain people are like that. It's the lack of passion. The people who make it stop caring about the product because there is too much direction coming from the people up top who aren't actually *making it.*\n\nI agree. You see this in TV and movies a lot too. So much of it feels so generic that I just can't get into it. There's no soul.\n\nWhich is funny because something doesn't add up. You'd think there'd be a min/max mentality towards game-making, trying to extract as much game out of the smallest budget possible.\n\nYet Concord, a damn shooter, with mechanics that have been around for a decade, costs as much as the annual budget of a small country.\n\nI really can't understand how they spent so much money on such a project. There has to be some tax-evasion wizardry or something of the sort behind these ludicrous amounts.\n\nYour comment made me look up the game's budget and.... almost half a BILLION dollars?? What a joke.\n\nAnd they didn't market it *at all.*\n\nMeanwhile the next week, Sony also release Astro Bot. A game made by a 65 person team, certainly costing much much less than Concord, and it's one of their most successful PS5 releases.\n\nThe thing is Astros world and maybe Astro bot (haven’t played it yet) are very clever games. Especially for first time gamers. My four year old loves it and I don’t mind playing parts for him so that’s a massive win.\n\nThat's speculation/rumor and was never confirmed. they say it took 8 years but it was only 4 years of active development. Only sony knows how much it cost\n\nThis is the correct analysis. Games used to be made out of passion of playing them and now they’re mostly about profit. That’s why indie games are the ones with the overwhelmingly positive reviews. Triple A 50Gb monsters are pretty but my favorite games are from no name devs.\n\nBaldurs Gate 3. That’s all that needs to be said.\n\nWhen other studios and Devs were complaining that BG3 set the bar too high, it was truly a facepalm moment.\n\nBecause BG3 should be the standard for AAA games and these company's DO NOT want that. They want to shit out the same generic ass game year after year and have gamers stumbling over themselves to buy it, w/ all the premium skins and shit, of course.\n\nLol Balders Gate 3 is just about everything I want from a modern AAA game. Like Damm they hit it out of the park, and I hope they stay in the Limelight for years to hopefully show gaming companies how to make a great game.\n\nLies of P was one of my favorite games of the past year, but I couldn’t tell you who published it TBH. All I know is it wasn’t one of the usual suspects, they’d never take such a risk. \n\nRunning around this Victorian horror hellscape as a cyborg Pinocchio slaying all the evil machine puppets and learning that your lies have consequences was soo fucking cool. By the end of the game, I really wanted my character to become human!\n\nWhen I play Wukong, I can tell the devs were passionate about the project and it was hella fun to play.\n\nThe effort difference between \"I made this game because I love games like it\" and \"I made this game because 14 senior product managers had a meeting and laid out a rough outline of what a GAS cash cow would look like\".\n\nWhen you hire psychologists to find the best ways to make people spend money, then design a game around it, the game isn't very fun. Like Diablo 4.\n\nMaybe don't make high budget shitty games?\n\nno one asked for a cartoony shooter/team game (overwatch clone) in a market already saturated with them. just because Fortnite is big doesn't mean we need 50 more, especially not with battle passes, f\\*\\*k off.\n\nExactly, and that’s the problem with executives making the big decisions, they don’t actually know what people want. They see a graph saying Fortnite made 70 bajillion dollars and think “ah yes if we make a slightly different clone of this we will also make 70 bakillion dollars”, which isn’t how the video game market works.\n\nIt's mind boggling these companies even survive. They don't even understand the market\n\nThe thing is in the past these companies were often started by passionate creatives hwo just wanted to make cool shit and were rewarded handsomely for making something quality. \n\nThen the big money got into games and saw how much money they made but they want to do what big money does to EVERYTHING .\n\nthey want to water down the core product ( less interesting gameplay ) , chop it up and serve it piece meal with extra costs ( micro transactions , battle passes,  unimpressive DLC) ,  and mass produce it and hope the masses swallow the drivel . \n\n People have said for ages traditional tech doesn't work  when it gets involved with games because they are a fundamentally different business... same should  be said of  traditional business people  ... running a game company the same way you'd run chipotle , or  Apple is a terrible idea  and that's what we're seeing Big money making shit-tier games choices.\n\nThat’s why seeing all these failures  is so delicious\n\nmy heart warms with each 400 zagillion dollar budget flop\n\nMy doesn’t cause they never fucking learn anything then blame us\n\nThey will outwardly blame and deflect, because it looks REALLY bad to shareholders to admit you fucked up, but I guarantee you the people in charge of approving Concord, Skull and Bones, those big flops, are getting absolutely demolished in the corporate world for failure.\n\nUbisoft is imploding right now due to years of failed or underperforming big budget games.\n\nShareholders see that happening.\n\nPity said flops just result in mass lay offs for the ground level work offs whilst the fucks up top just write shit off as business expenses or what tricks they have and never face real consequences for their shit judgement. Even though the failures of their products are entirely their fault.\n\nDon't forget huge payouts when they leave the company they ran into the ground.\n\nyep and people say shit like “ceos take all the risk of the company” to justify how much they earn, even though when things do fall through the higher ups get massive pay packages and a lovely golden parachute to go fuck over some other place. doesn’t sound very ‘risky’ to me\n\nI revel in the Schadenfrude too, but then I remember the hundreds of workers who get laid off and dozens of studios closed when these games fail. I wish we could have good games and workers' rights. \n\nI know the money has to come from somewhere. I know developers need a deadline otherwise they'll bloat the game to death. I just wish I worked a little differently.  I've recently finished Psychodyssey and Blood, Sweat, and Pixels. Great insight in the game industry for those who haven't experienced them.\n\na lot of them get laid off anyway even if their game is successful once the game is done\n\nAnother thing that's happening is wearing out customer Loyalty.   \nOnce its gone, people don't come back easily or not at all.   \nThere's only so much watering down and bullshit a loyal customer will handle before they just stop and walk away. Going back a step doesn't immediately bring back those loyal customers either because their patience and loyalty has already been expended.   \nThey've gotta go back to what the original passionate folks created and re-earn it from scratch, but good luck after shitting on those customers and catering to the shareholders.\n\nIts to the point that when I see a title from some of the major publishers like Ubisoft or EA I automatically have a negative perception of the title before I even look at it, due to stuff like loot boxing, building grind into their games, and just an overall hyper corporate feel to their games.\n\nLmao, I was thinking of the exact same two companies when I read the title of this post.\n\nCompanies are started by product designers, then taken over by finance people to manage growth, then managed by accountants after they hit peak market share and focus from growth to cost cutting until they collapse for good.\n\nThis is called enshitification. There is a word for it now.\n\nVideogames are art.\n\nMarket research does not make good art, just uninspired, same-old same-old slop.\n\nYeah, it's a creative industry, you need people with passion that are driving it. People who actually love games have a natural instinct to find what people like.\n\nActually market research is exactly what they’re *not* doing. \n\nIf they did proper research they would actually learn what people like from successful games and dislikes about non-successful ones, then use that data to design a product to fulfill a role in the market.\n\nBean counters buy successful companies and then make them do unsuccessful things and refuse to do successful things because those don't have the potential to become infinite money-printers like Fortnite.\n\nIt’s the history of an industry that never learns anything teeheehee hee\n\nIt's utterly insane they don't understand this\n\nI have Fortnite. I like Fortnite. If you make a game like Fortnite, why would I play your game over Fortnite? How can you offer me an experience that is better than Fortnite, when I just want to play Fortnite?\n\n(I don't actually play Fortnite, but it's the game Sweeney mentioned)\n\nThe exact same shit happened with WoW and MMO's too. So many games were released trying to pull gamers away from WoW by trying to be like WoW, when gamers already had and liked WoW\n\nYou might not ever be able to have the market capture of WoW, but if you offer an entirely different experience than WoW, you at least won't be competing with a game that has insane inertia\n\nWhy didn't they learn from the lessons of what, 20 years ago?\n\nWe remember how many “WoW killers” came out and flopped hard or just sputtered on supported by a small handful of whales.\n\nWoW was the Everquest killer though. Overnight just destroyed it. Though granted SOE shot itself in the foot at the same time and taught the MMO industry to never release a sequel to your cash cow.\n\nEveryone thought if it could happen once, it could happen again, and kept trying for like ten years.\n\nThe problem is that they're still thinking like they did back in the 90s and 2000s. Remember when Street Fighter II came out and suddenly everyone started making their own fighting games (and companies would often have multiple ones) resulting in a golden age for the genre? Same with C&amp;C and WarCraft starting an RTS arms race. While that worked back then, it doesn't work now due to the high cost and long development times for games.\n\nEase of access and prices also play a factor.\n\nWhy should I buy the knockoff when all my online friends are playing the other one? They're both available for similar price on the same online store as well.\n\nYeah. In the arcade days you play whatever machine is available. In the console days you play whatever your parents buy or let you buy. Then it was just availablity and word of mouth but Now with internet people know how and where to get the \"best\" so anything half baked doesn't fly for long.\n\nThey only fly when there's a market for it.\n\nNew genre? Look at PUBG for an example\n\nOther games neglecting the playerbase or untapped markets? New one comes in and takes over, like Fortnite on console\n\nAdd to that, the culture changed. Back then, you wanted to play what everyone else was playing. Who was everyone else? People you knew personally. So if your circle played Street Fighter, guess what you played? Then a totally different circle wants to play what everyone else is playing, but their \"everyone else\" is playing Tekken.\n\nToday, playing what everyone else is playing means the one single game the steamers and YouTube people are playing. Why? Because everyone else is playing what they're playing. And everyone else is almost literally everyone.\n\nThe diversity within genres from back then have stayed (the handful of fighting games instead of one or two), but new games and IPs are \"this is the one\" and all others are rendered irrelevant.\n\n[deleted]\n\nThe golf game I just got has a fuckin battle pass\n\nKill me now \n\nFor me it's not even the cartoony part that bugs me. I simply hate playing online games. I want a game I can pop in and enjoy a story or long single player campaign for a while and immerse myself. instead of ....  run 'n gun then loot bs.\n\nMeanwhile, here I am loading up my 10000 Terraria playthrough.\n\nThat's exactly it. The market is already saturated with exceptional games that people spend most of their time in.\n\nI don’t just miss the 90s-00s because there were quality games that didn’t demand 5000 hours of my time, I miss them because developers did *weird shit*.\n\n\nThat era got us stuff like Animal Crossing, Rez, Katamari, Mirror’s Edge. A little later on we got Noby Noby Boy, Portal and Patapon. (Obviously this isn’t remotely an exhaustive list.)\n\n\nGaming is currently at a level of generic I didn’t think possible. We used to mock stuff that “looked like mobile games.” And now every large title is just devoid of any aesthetic imagination, much less gameplay innovation.\n\n[deleted]\n\nOh, you must mean that you want another game as a service with a built-in battle pass and paid DLC that we've already been working on instead of finishing the beta version that we're going to shamelessly sell you for $70 (but don't worry, we'll probably have the base game finished sometime within the first year).\n\n--way too many CEOs\n\nThey are too dense and will only realize it too late when they start to go bankrupt.\n\nEven then, they won’t realize it. They’ll just blame somebody else.\n\nAnd they will lay off the devs. You know, the people who actually MAKE the games.\n\nWelp, he was right in the first half, a lot of high budget games aren't selling. Tho because \"they're not social enough\" is a level of brain rot that's indicative of the overarching real issue.\n\nSaying this right after a single player game sold 20M copies in like 2 weeks is crazy, too. How out of touch can this guy be?\n\nThat's because for game execs, a 20m sales single player its not \"success\". What they want is a chicken farm of golden eggs like Fortnite or gta online.\n\nThen they can continue to go out of business. Nobody is happy with a decent year or minimal growth year. They all want a super high profit year and line must always go up. It's what has rotted the entire american economy from the inside.\n\nEdit: I'm salty because I saw my dad as a small business owner be happy to keep his 2 guys employed at an autobody shop. Not concerned with growth, just constant work and good quality. Business was sustainable, which was enough to raise us and put food on the table. Insurance companies basically put him out of business. He couldn't do the work without losing money on some jobs.\n\nMy econ classes in college really underscored how detrimentally consumptive and unsustainable our current model of capitalism is.\n\nI don’t even think you have to learn it in an Econ class to understand it’s unsustainable. Just have a job that discusses financial goals and just experience it for yourself. I work for a consulting firm I just look at how my company will have projected revenue and profits for the business. It’s always an increase in profits. Even if we miss by a few million which is still an improvement from last year but NOT QUITE the projected value, we get a round of layoffs. It’s absolutely unsustainable. You’d think when if we were to smash the projected values we all get nice raises or bonuses right? Naw but the big wigs at top sure do. We get raises that don’t even keep up with inflation. The jobs are going to campus hires and offshores like India to squeeze that extra bit of profit every year so forget about quality of service at that point.\n\nHogwarts Legacy was one of the best selling games last year.  No multiplayer, no online and microtransactions.   Just a solid game.\n\nCan we just admit, too, that this game was just fun? It had a bunch of nonsense in it with a pretty silly storyline, but it didn't matter because it was simply fun to play. I don't know what has made game devs think people want to play tedious games with chores in them constantly, yet that seems to be so much of what is released these days.\n\n\"devs think people want to play tedious games with chores in them constantly\" my brother in Christ, have you seen how much money mobile games make? its obvious that they would try this for PC and Console games too, and it fails hard as we can currently see.\n\nThe problem that they don't seem to be able to see there is that mobile games are time wastes for when you are on transport and the like. Whereas when you are at home you kind of want and have access to better and more rewarding forms of entertainment.\n\nYeah I don’t want to play anything that needs a control pad or keyboard on my phone, touchscreens are too small, fiddly and insensitive for that. So for the best experience I’m limited to the established phone game stuff since that’s all optimised for the control format. \n\nWhen I’m at home and wanting to game, I’m on my PC or my console and never my phone, and I don’t really want anything that could be on a phone gameplay wise because those games suck compared to good console/pc games. \n\nIt’s not fucking rocket science is it?\n\nI'll gonna be honest .\n\nI bought the game day 1 and dropped half way .\n\nThe quest and rewards are awful , it's just numbers. Very repetitive\n\nAgreed. It's beautiful, but as shallow as a puddle.\n\nI would go so far as to say, forcing social features into games is actively making them less enjoyable.\n\nThis. Gaming is a great way to get away from people for some alone time when you have to interact with them every other occasion.\n\nCompulsory multiplayer just sucks the joy out of it.\n\n&gt;The perceived value of a game, he continued, \"grows in proportion to the number of your friends that you can connect to,\" for everything from playing games together to chatting by voice, watching virtual concerts, or \"doing other kinds of cool, virtual things online.\"\n\nHe's so close yet so far. The social aspect of a game is extremely important, but being online and multiplayer doesn't necessarily equate to this. Zelda Breath of the Wild was a very \"social\" game because the world was interactive in unexpected ways and there were people talking about new cool things they found for months. We need more fun interactive games. They're devoting too much money toward graphics, IP/franchises, and big open worlds when they should be focusing on gameplay first and visuals second. Maybe adding multiplayer last.\n\n&gt; Maybe adding multiplayer last.\n\nMultiplayer focus is fine, its just got to be multiplayer *for the benefit of the player and gameplay*, not an afterthought that mostly exists to force people online and create monetization paths.\n\nI love all of the social aspects of (checks notes) Elden Ring?\n\nElden Ring has social aspects, like the messages and invading. But yeah, it's not the reason why it became so popular.\n\nGames like that are \"social\" in that people will talk about it online, watch streams of people playing it etc. \n  \nSurely that's got to be the goal? Make something that takes over the social conversation amongst gamers, without necessarily having to be a \"social\" game with online play?\n\nYes, but I think this is confusing causation with correlation.\n\nArguably any really good game that gets a big user base has people talking about it regardless of genre or mechanics. So at that point is more a result of the succes rather than the source of the succes.\n\nFort\n\nNight\n\nI don't understand why anyone would buy *any* AAA game at launch. I have too large of a backlog to drop $60 on a game that won't be finished for another year.\n\nBud you nickle and dime us with bug ridden games, shove a battlepass down our throats and riddle the games with micro transactions. The Fuck do you expect? Give us quality games with those budgets instead of games as step away from mobile games.\n\n[deleted]\n\nI can't wait til I have to pay a subscription for each bolt and screw in my car\n\n\"AutoSecure, the revolution in vehicle assembly fastener solutions... Now only $14.99 per month! (per unit, fees apply)\"\n\nNews tomorrow morning: 3 killed in unavoidable one-in-a-million freak accident when automated vehicle screws unfasten at highway speeds, driver negligence suspected\n\nReddit comments tomorrow afternoon: Wake up, sheeple! The driver agreed to waive liability in the Terms&amp;Conditions when he decided to have a car to get to the job he needed in order to not die, so it's his own fault if you think about it Logically.\n\nGame studios should take note from Hollywood.  Eventually you are putting too much money into your project. Money that doesn't even need to be put into it.\n\nThe money isn't the issue. The people spending the money thinking that means they understand what makes a game good, is the issue. Corporate heads and finance people should not be dictating what's in a game, but they are, in part because they're investing a lot of money.\n\nI think developing a good team of developers and not firing them right after a game is launched is pretty important too.  I don't believe it's just a gaming industry issue but companies don't put enough money into staff training and retention.   They should treat good developers and managers like star athletes and work on their bullpens.\n\n“If we reduce the number of employees for better short-term financial results, employee morale will decrease. I sincerely doubt employees who fear that they may be laid off will be able to develop software titles that could impress people around the world.”\n\n- Satoru Iwata, CEO of Nintendo, 2013\n\nNote that this was during their worse years of the Wii U era\n\nIt’s important to have corporate leaders who understand both the business AND game development aspects of their company and industry. Without that experience and personal investment, a company will not achieve meaningful long term growth\n\nI want to add that, during same said era, Iwata and other high level employees at Nintendo took large pay cuts. I believe Iwata himself saw a paycut of 50% personally. There are a lot of lessons other companies could take from Iwata and his leadership style. \n\nI'm willing to get had it been anyone else, the Wii U may well have been the end of Nintendo in the console race. Dumber corpo shitheads would just axe the console division to save money and move on.  Say what you will about Nintendo as a company, but that would have been a tragedy. Thank goodness they had someone who could appreciate the art as well as the business.\n\nEDIT: Another good quote;\n\n&gt;_\"[On my business card, I am a corporate president. In my mind, I am a game developer, but in my heart, I am a gamer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DaqD2_Cn0Q).\"_\n\n— Iwata speaking at GDC\n\nNintendo maybe a piece of shit company to consumers and customers alike, but they know how to make games. Unfortunately, Pokemon isn't one of them, but hopefully that changes.\n\nThey only publish pokemon, Game Freak develops it.\n\nPersonally speaking, as both a  consumer and (former) developer, that’s the most important thing\n\nI buy a game because I want a good game, and Nintendo, to this day, consistently makes good games\n\nNot every project they make is maximally profitable, but every bit adds to their total portfolio, which pays serious dividends in the long term thanks to remakes and remasters\n\nToo many other big game companies nowadays are too busy floundering around with other nonsense and aren’t focusing on that most basic of principles\n\nI personally feel that Nintendo still understands the core values of the craft, and definitely are NOT a “piece of shit company to customers and consumers”. But we’ll agree to disagree there\n\nAlso they aren’t in charge of Pokemon. They only have a partial ownership over TPCi\n\n&gt; I buy a game because I want a good game, and Nintendo, to this day, consistently makes good games\n\nHoly shit, this.\n\nIt doesn't matter what console gen in history you're talking about. You could walk into a shop at any time since the release of the N64, buy a brand new console and any random Nintendo IP launch title blind and you're guaranteed of a few things:\n\n* The game will be good.\n\n* The game will be finished.\n\n* The game will be playable on your hardware.\n\nIt's a sad indictment of the rest of the gaming industry that at least points 2 and 3 aren't the standard, but that's the current gaming environment.\n\nTo be fair, Gamefreak makes Pokemon, and the IP is shared between them, Nintendo, and Creatures Inc, who mainly handle merchandise and the TCG. The games are simply a means to make and sell merchandise, which as far as I'm aware, is the real moneymaker for Pokemon. Unfortunately, this means the games will never have the time needed to be really fleshed out experiences, as they're moreso excuses to get 100+ new potential toy designs into the public consciousness.\n\nRight, that's a part of what I'm saying. The Execs go \"We're &lt;insert long-standing studio name here&gt; we make good products.\" and then forget that the *reason* that studio makes good products is it's team. They don't trust the team, so they don't attribute their success to the team, so they don't care about the team, and so the team doesn't perform for them.\n\nno, I'd argue the money is also an issue.  Didn't one of the new Tomb Raider games, I think the 2nd one, sell like 5 million copies, but it didn't meet sales expectations due to how much it cost to make?\n\n[deleted]\n\nThere are plenty of single player games that sell extremely well that aren't social at all, though?\n\nComplain all you want about Valve. As long as they stay a private company, I'm happy with them effectively holding the reigns of PC gaming.\n\nIt's been almost fifteen years since EA boldly stated 'single player games are finished'.\n\nThese corpo fucks are choosing to be ignorant.\n\nFinal Fantasy 16, Cyberpunk 2077, Baldur's Gate 3, Black Myth Wukong, God of War, and like every Zelda game says hi. 🙄\n\n\\[Edit\\]\n\nAdded a few more obvious games.\n\npokemon the most profitable thing ever is a single player experience first for most of the games before you can trade and battle\n\nand they're still getting lazy with that. there's so much they could do to make that experience richer for the billions of fans they have, yet they're churning out weird mechanics for another 100 more Pokémon or variations in another bs region and oops ran out of time, here's a half-assed rendered world to plop them into, we'll take your $€60 and no sales 5 years after release.\n\nBecause that’s where the money is.\n\nPokemon is an oddball among game franchises because the actual game sales only comprise a minority of their profits\n\nThe bulk of the franchise’s income stems from the **ludicrous** volume of merchandise and licensing they do based on the Pokemon designs. It’s like 4-5 times the game sales\n\nIt’s no exaggeration to say that the 100+ new designs per game they make generate far more profit that the game they were made in\n\never since they graduated from the 3ds these games have gotten bad and i say this as a life long pokemon fan\n\nIt started with the 3DS. Sun and Moon was the last game I bought.  \nHow do you lag a console by making a pokemons model glow?\n\nAnd that's not even scratching the surface\n\nElden Ring, Wukong etc.\n\nThe single player statement is from a time when the RTS was on the way out and the MMORPG was in its prime and MOBA exploding in popularity for sure, but its still funny because Skyrim released like the year after, and hit like 60m combined sales last year.   \nThey thought they could see which way the wind was blowing but lmao were they wrong.\n\nBG3 being the most recent--and arguably most fervent--argument against this \"games have to be social\" thing. Just make a good game.\n\nThere are some multiplayer games that are doing well. Warframe is seeing a surge in players right now. Turns out if you listen to player feedback and make the game FOR the players instead of for profit, people actually like it.\n\nElden ring is the first single player game i played in a long long looooong time. I loved it.\nBaldurs gate, while capable of multi-player, but solo play was more convenient, so I'd count it as a single player game. Both are great.\n\nMy brother in christ I do not want to be social. I want a rich and rewarding gaming experience. The market is saturated with multiplayer games if that's your thing. People don't love live service. People have had enough battle Royale shooters. When a game is good, you're not gonna believe this, but it sells.\n\nI honestly miss the old fashioned one player game. The reason The Last of Us, Bioshock, Red Dead Redemption, etc do so well is because you get to focus on the game as you purchased it. There’s no pressure to buy your way through it to defeat other players or to look cool in front of other people. \n\nIt’s not a social pressure environment.\n\nGod these CEOs and high level execs are so fucking dense.\n\nThere are tons of games with obscenely high budgets that sell *very* well. Want good sales? Make good games.\n\nSweeney is just being a salesman here and so many people don't see it. He purposesly doesn't mention WuKong, Elden Ring, Baldur's Gate.\n\nAnd purposely doens't mention concord. And he seems to think Suicide Squad is not a live service game.\n\nWhat’s funny is WuKong was built on Unreal Engine so they made a pretty penny off of that game.\n\nHe is literally only fluffing up Fortnite and jerking off because it still prints money for them. \n\n\nIf he wants to put his money where his mouth is he would make a new IP that has all those features and see if it survives in the market place. It wouldn't because people don't buy video games because they can \"talk to their friends in voice chat\" in them.\n\nYeah the games are high budget, but that isn't reflected in the final product. *That's* the problem. You don't see anybody complaining about BG3, and there is zero social interaction with other humans in that game.\n\nAlso, if we wanna use BG3 as a good example, looking at the game of the year every year sonce 2017, only one required you to play multiplayer.\n\nThe rest were all single play games. Zelda: BOTW, God of War, Sekiro, TLOU2, (It Takes Two), Elden Ring, BG3\n\n\nSocial interaction has nothing to do with this. It's that the ones in control know nothing about game design and similar, and force those below them to trace trends which ends up with games made with little actual passion behind them. Amongst other things.\n\nAlso, as far as I am aware, *none of these games have microtransactions* (Though I didn't check, so I may be wrong, but I doubt it)\n\nThis was my thought exactly. The truly great games I can think of in the last decade were primarily single player. Sure some have multiplayer/online components, but that’s not the driving point of the game.\n\nYeah you put 100 million into a game. \n\nFeatures are missing, it’s buggy, incomplete, hollow and shallow. \n\nOf course it’s not selling.\n\nTechnically you can do coop. It’s just not forced on you which is nice. \n\nThe game has also - surprise surprise-.... NO microtransactions! Such a coincidence!\n\n\"We keep spending obscene amounts of money to make shitty games with no soul or creativity while shoving micro-transactions into them. Why are the games selling badly??\"\n\nGames are now:\n\n80$ for the base game\n\n40-50$ for DLC\n\n60$/year for battle passes\n\nNearly unplayable at release due to glitches\n\nMediocre gameplay/story with too many cut scenes \n\n\n\nBut it’s probably because they aren’t social enough\n\nOh man I have a CRAZY industry idea - focus on making fun games, not slot machines\n\n\"High budget\" most spent on looks, gameplay is just copy pasted from other games. No wonder they fail, you play one, you've played them all.\n\nI guess Concord and BG3 were just anomalies then?\n\nEdit: first is an example of an expensive multiplayer game that failed, and BG3 is a single player game that was super successful. Both contradicting his thesis\n\nConcord should have been f2p. I honestly thought it was a borderlands style game from the first trailer I saw and I was excited about that. The characters and world could easily be re worked\n\ngames are obviously costing way too much, have too many people working on them, and are taking forever to make. the original world of warcraft was created by less than 100 people, cost $63 million (more or less $100m today adjusted for inflation), and was made in 5 years even though they completely wrote the engine from scratch.\n\nthe reality is that a game like that would probably have 3-400 people working on it nowadays, cost half a billion dollars, and take 10 years to make. imo profit-driven corporate bloat is the biggest reason why we now have so many shitty titles that cost way too much to make.\n\nHigh development cost used to signal quality. It no longer does, and gamers know it. \n\nThe fact is, AAA gaming has been largely unimaginative, soulless, and boring over the past decade. And in that time, developers continued to milk every last drop of cash from a generation of gamers who grew up during a period where gamers were the opposite. They were inventive, creative, and mind blowing. That time has long past. \n\nIf the gaming industry is gonna survive, its gonna have to return to its roots. Smaller dev teams, longer incubation times, less overhead, more freedom to break boundaries. Bring in better writing. Bring in new ideas. New dynamics. gaming in the 2020s is defined by the \"genre\", limited by it, handcuffed. \n\nEvery developer making a game right now should step back, and look objectively at their project, and ask \"does this game need to be made?\" It's a simple question, but deeply informative in the dialectic. \n\nNo we don't need another reskinned battle royale, or moba, or hero shooter. We don't need another wow clone, or open world checklist simulator. We don't need more of the same. we need more of the different. We don't need more \"games as a service\" when all that \"service\" entails is different ways to squeeze the player into forking over cash. \n\nTo be fair, gaming is not alone in this unimaginative black hole. Entertainment in general is in a serious gully. Movies, Television, and even books have been far less impressive and captivating than in years past.\n\nWhere is all the money going anyway? So many games used to be made with budgets a fraction of the size and were superior by almost every metric. Surely 80% of the budget doesn't go to paying mocap actors\n\nProbably shouldn’t have raised the prices and also have the games run like ass on release\n\nIf they want to keep upping the prices of games, fine. But the quality better reflect that. I see no reason to spend X amount on a brand new release when it's going to be buggy as fuck and not playable until weeks, if not a month after release.\n\nMaybe people are done with shitty bussiness practices?\n\nJust👏🏻make👏🏻finished👏🏻single👏🏻player👏🏻games\n\nMost of us aren’t looking for Fortnite, COD, Battlefield, etc\n\nStopping trying to setup the ability to milk the corpse of a game.\n\nOh look it's Tim Sweeney. \n\nThe guy who...\n\nclaims Steam is a monopoly while he pays publishers to not sell games on other store fronts, claims Apple is a monopoly while at the same time making excuses why it's okay for consoles to use an Apple like ecosystem, claims he is fighting for \"consumer freedom\" on mobile while his store front doesn't natively support Linux, and who pushes for side loading on Apple, but won't push for the same on console.\n\nOn the Linux topic, UT2004 shipped with the Linux installer on the disc. Now when they buy studios they make them remove native Linux builds, for example Rocket League. Tim can fuck off, he is a rotten waste of oxygen.\n\nyep, Tim Sweeney is a giant douche. \n\nIt's clear from listening to him talk for a few minutes all he cares about is extracting as much money as possible.\n\nThe problem is that making a good game is no longer the top priority.\n\nMaybe make good games? Idk man it doesn’t seem that hard.\n\nBig games with big prices don't sell because they big suck. \n\nPeople don't want to pay premium to beta test a game advertised as complete.\n\nMost high budget games these days are the 5th or 7th iteration in a series. Because investors wanted a safe bet on something that worked before. Or they are a clone of something that worked for another big company to compete.\n\nThey just haven't innovated enough or been creative.\n\nMeanwhile budget indie games are blossoming because they try out new concepts, some fail but others work beautifully.\n\nSo maybe take risks with smaller budgets?\n\nIt’s funny. When it’s a passion project, we see huge success. Minecraft, Terraria, Stardew Valley, Shovel Knight, etc., are all examples of gamers making the game they want. Sure, you can argue they’re just indie devs being indie devs, but they all just started making a game they wanted to see. They didn’t start to appease shareholders. We need to get back to supporting developers who make games that gamers actually want to see.\n\nFor every indie dev developing their passion project that succeed there are hundreds, if not thousands of others that doesn't succeed. The game industry as a whole is infamous for relying on passionate developers who love the medium to compensate for the relatively lackluster pay.\n\nfalse equivalency though. You dont see all the indie devs that fail because why would you? They had no money for marketing. You see every triple AAA failure because they spend so much on marketing. This makes it seem like AAA games fail more than indie games, but they are just more visible."

    "all_comment_text": "I mean that’s good for Steam Deck users since many developers are blocking Linux.\n\nSD user here. Yep I appreciate knowing if I’m going to be wasting my money or not\n\nIsn’t Steam’s refund policy pretty friendly about stuff like that?\n\nyes, pretty much the only issue is you buy it on your PC, play it for long enough to be out of the refund window, then try to play it on your SteamDeck after you've logged enough hours on your windows install and realize it doesn't work.\n\ntelling people upfront is good though, since there might be a few similar games and being able to play on a portable unit might really matter to me.\n\nIs anything preventing a dev from adding this anti-cheat to an already existing game? \n\nYou could log 2000+ hours and then one day the dev randomly drops a new update and now you can't use it on the steam deck anymore.\n\nI think that's a special case enough for a refund, although you may need to escalate it to a human CS rep. Steam's 2 hour refund window only apples to the automatic no-questions-asked refund.\n\nSteam shouldn’t be held accountable for developers screwing people over 2000 hours later\n\nThen steam needs to implement policy to prevent that. Otherwise Steam will be known as the platform where \"developers can screw you over 2000 hours later\"\n\nValve has refunded customers when things like this have happened in the past. Looong after the customer purchased the game.\n\nYeah I think GTA:V was a recent example of this. GTA:V just got some flavor of Anti-Cheat and a TON of Linux Users got refunds from Valve because it broke Linux compatibility\n\nI mean developers can screw you over 2000 hours latter is a common occurrence. \n\nAlways online and then they shut down the servers is common.\n\n[deleted]\n\nI think even in those cases, the cost of refund still hits the developer's wallet in the end.  Steam might front the money but just take it out of future sales for the dev till balance is paid off or outright take it back from the dev in a charge. Either way, I'm sure steam has a system in place so a dev can't just abuse things 2000 hours later and keep the money.\n\nSpeaking as a developer they have no such system in place, and they really should.  The only requirement is that you keep a single version of your game up, it doesn't even have to work well.\n\nYou'd be surprised how many people will say something like \"Well you got your money out of it.\" I'll admit I can see both points of view but yeah I'd still prefer if customers were able to get their money back if a studio does something shady even after thousands of played hours.\n\nSteam should be held accountable for the products it sells on it's store.\n\nThat's a bullshit take. If you buy the license to play a game, you don't do so with the expectation it'll be revoked within 2,000 hours of play.\n\nSteam should be held accountable because their contract is with the customer. Their contract with the developer, their supplier, is their own problem.\n\nDoesn't Steam issue refunds when devs break their games? IIRC Steam issued a ton when the Helldivers PSN account thing happened and a bunch of people suddenly couldn't play.\n\nIt has happened several times where devs implement new DRM breaking Steam Deck support. For Anti-Cheat, recent examples were GTA Online and Battlefield 1. (though the overlap of BF1 players and steam deck players are probably minimal, given that PC handhelds tend to focus more on the single player non competitive aspect of gaming more than the reverse, especially since most pvp shooters have anti-cheat by default and is not steam deck friendly in the first place.)\n\nApex Legends also axed linux support recently.\n\nEA WRC added kernel level anti cheat about six months after launch\n\nRust dumped native support, then added Easy anti-cheat requirement on all official servers, effectively killing proton use\n\nHelldivers 2 was this exact instance. The game was released globally, and then Sony changed the rules to ban players outside areas they offer PSN and were trying to implement a required PSN login.\n\nValve agreed to extend refunds to players who were upset by this change, and Sony eventually dropped the PSN requirement after backlash, but never relisted the game to the affected regions.\n\nI mean I think that’s something similar to what’s happening with Apex Legendary atm. Granted, I only have very light passing knowledge on the subject so please correct me, but they are getting review bombed at the moment because they just completely dropped Linux/Steam Deck support  due to people I guess spoofing one or both of them while cheating, so they went the nuclear option instead of actually trying to solve the issue.\n\nIn a similar vein GTA Online just randomly shoehorned an anti cheat into their game recently (added hilarity since they were notoriously god awful on that front for years choosing to allow the online to be festered with cheats since day one while they went after single player modders instead) and now many people can’t even play the game anymore because of how poorly it’s affected performance.\n\nLastly on a not at all similar note, you could also argue shit like the PlayStation debacle with Helldivers 2 as problematic where 3 months into the game they started trying to push a required PSN account in order to keep playing the game (which is only valid to do in a handful of countries and basically blocked 170ish countries worldwide from being able to play) causing mass refunds thanks to Steam allowing it and now still prevents people from even purchasing the game since last I checked those countries are *still* locked out.\n\nThat just happened to GTA V.\n\nHappened this week with Apex. Ran pretty ok on deck, but now no longer supported due to anti cheat changes\n\nLeague of Legends did this. Update came, all Windows 7 users were forced to uninstall.\n\nAhhh yeah that would be an issue. I guess if someone has a SteamDeck it’s good practice to try any new games on it to cover their bases.\n\nIf I was within the 2-hour window, I've never had them give me an ounce of grief about a refund. I once refunded a game like 5 years later lol, forgot it was in my library. No issues.\n\nBut yeah, like you said, if you exceed the window before you realize the anti-cheat (or just general Linux incompatibility) is gonna cause problems, then it may be a different story.\n\nBut if you just explain yourself honestly and earnestly and it's not a bullshit reason, they may very well let you refund it. I have refunded things after the window before, due to extenuating circumstances, and that hasn't ever been an issue either.\n\nIn my experience, their customer support is pretty damn good.\n\nYes but paying for and then potentially downloading and trying to run the app to then figure out it will refuse to run on your system and then have to go through the refund process is a huge pain compared to one more row of info on the store page\n\nDefinitely a great point. I was just saying it’s not like with Sony where if you download the game you’re basically told to fuck off regardless of your reasoning for wanting a refund.\n\nIt usually is but still annoying to have spent the time to buy it and can take a few days for the money back. I think there are also some exceptions concerning games that are linked to other account services or launchers like the Ubisoft or Activision launcher (not 100% if that's actually still the case)\n\nOnly until you own a game for a year and then they add Kernel Level anti-cheat but don't refund your money.\n\nThanks WRC, EA you fucking dicks.\n\nHave you actually tried refunding if that's what you want? Explain in the ticket what's up and maybe they will honor it.\n\nThere have been cases of returns past 14 day/2 hour mark. I don't know if it will work for a year, but considering it's something the developer has done and not you, it has a chance to work\n\nIt is friendly in general, I’ve never been denied a refund.\n\nFor all of their flaws their refund policy is pretty solid. I refunded over 40 DLCs and games (because I was a dum-dum and paid for them with a card that is supposed to only be used for business expenses) \n\nThey didn’t even bat an eye.\n\nNormally, as long as it's not made well after you bought it, as it has happened in some very high profile cases lately. F'em!\n\nProtonDB I think let's people know if it can be played\n\nNot protondb areweanticheatyet  shows compatibility for games that use anticheat \n\nhttps://areweanticheatyet.com/\n\nIt does but PDB is reactive\n\nGenuine question: are there really many devs blocking Linux? Or is it just a few big publishers mandating it? (not that the answer actually changes the end result)\n\nareweanticheatyet.com\n\nmost confusingly, many non-kernel-level anti-cheat options DO support Linux but the developer chooses to opt out (or refuses to opt in) of that support. some games using Easy Anti-Cheat work, others don't. I'm guessing Microsoft is paying to influence that choice in many of those cases.\n\nAre these anti-cheats actually any good, though?\n\nUsually, no.\n\nYou're going to get lots of people saying \"no they're garbage because I still see cheaters!!\" It is much more involved than this. First off some games are more vulnerable to cheating than others, usually due to game engine exploits or client authoritative behavior. No anticheat is going to be bullet proof. Cheat developers and anticheat developers are constantly going back and forth with new ways to exploit/detect. The point of an anticheat is to raise the bar to cheat. There will still be cheaters, but if they're made to pay you might see one every 20 games rather than every game. At the end of the day anticheat will only be as good as the games code allows. If it's entirely server authoritative with kernel level anticheat then cheaters will be fairly rare.\n\nAm a dev but not personally on a project with anti-cheat, so take this with a grain of salt, but what I've heard from friends from a previous studio is their publisher decided to not support Linux in the anti-cheat specifically because of Steam-Deck.\n\nLinux makes up a *tiny* portion of players (&lt;2% overall, but for this type of game &lt;1%), Steam Deck way less. Generally Linux users were technical and understood the limited userbase comes with limited support from companies and a lot of DYIing solutions to get things working.\n\nSteamDeck however is marketed and sold the same way a console is, to a general less technical audience that expects everything to just work. So when something doesn't, it leads to a relatively big influx of support tickets from a tiny userbase. \n\nUltimately it just isn't worth spending the time and money doing Q/A, development, and support when the userbase is too small to make back that investment. The easiest way to opt out is with a blanket Linux \"ban\" by using anti-cheat that doesn't support it.\n\nIt also helps make the options for anti-cheat less limiting for the publishers. This is especially important for them as they tend to have years-long contracts to ship X amount of games with the anti-cheat that may have been signed before the Deck even released, so Deck support wasn't even necessarily able to be considered when the anti-cheat was chosen.\n\nAt the same time though, I know of another (singleplayer puzzle) game that specifically did add SteamDeck support because the singular OS version and hardware made it easier to add and Q/A Linux support, and it happens to work on most other Linux installs too (though without official support on other distros). \n\nThey didn't have a publisher, which likely helped push for support, but in turn it's helped them as a tiny indie studio to get a relatively high percentage Linux playerbase and a meaningfully more successful launch. So if a bigger publisher sees a similar result, I could see them making similar decisions too going forward.\n\nThat’s another thing you need to QA for. Prob not worth the squeeze \n\nThat's interesting if so because Halo is supported according to that website.\n\nIts two things.\n\nWindows vs Linux architecture is different enough that some things require much more work to get going.  Linux has a tiny market share so its just not worth the effort.  Same reason why even Apple has trouble with games (Linux based OS).\n\n\nLinux can offer much more control over your OS and deeper systems, such as Kernel.  This allows for much easier ways to circumvent anti-cheat engines, be it kernel level or otherwise.  This is a weaker argument as the market share is again tiny; so its more the anti cheat takes too much work to get going on Windows and Linux and just not worth the effort.\n\nOSX is Unix based, Linux is Unix-like but not directly Unix based\n\nIsn't OSX more closely related to BSD?\n\nin terms of timeline yes, but the BSD that OSX is based off of (NeXTSTEP) is a proprietary Unix OS. SO the chain is that OSX is ultimatelly a Unix Based system, but Linux' roots from a system thats Unix-like, but not unix itself.\n\n&gt; in terms of timeline yes, but the BSD that OSX is based off of (NeXTSTEP) is a proprietary Unix OS. SO the chain is that OSX is ultimatelly a Unix Based system, but Linux' roots from a system thats Unix-like, but not unix itself.\n\nWhy the fuck is this word salad getting upvoted?\n\nNeXTSTEP is normally not considered a BSD because it's a mix of Mach and BSD code, usually when we're talking about the BSD that OS X/macOS is based on, it's mostly FreeBSD parts, but they have some code from Net and Open.\n\nAs far as your \"in terms of timeline\", that's not a relevant to anything nor does it make sense. OS X/macOS is not related to Linux in any other way that they're both Unix-like systems(or as in macOS' case, a certified Unix). Linux' root is from Linux. It's not derived from anything other than the ideas of Unix. And before you start, no, it doesn't share code with Minix.\n\nThis sub proves, yet again, that no one here knows what they're talking about.\n\nThis is because kernel anti-cheats are fundamentally incompatible with a free system. Kernel anti-cheats depends on technology that forbid you from doing certain things with your computer, because the only way to ensure you don't bypass anti-cheat tech is by literally forbidding you from doing anything that could bypass it. Linux is built on the philosophy that you are the sole owner of your machine and thus nothing should ever be forbidden for you.\n\n&gt; Linux is built on the philosophy that you are the sole owner of your machine and thus nothing should ever be forbidden for you.\n\nYes, you are free to do whatever you can do with your system **but** you should not expect to be serviced by a third party if you don't agree with them on how they offer the service. Basically you can't have your cake and eat it.\n\nI'm sure they're tired of the refunds and complaints about not being able to play those games.\n\nFolks will really just do *anything* not to develop a more robust server-side detection system.\n\nYeah maybe that's not nearly as easy as it sounds.\n\nOh, I’m fully aware that it’s *incredibly* difficult but the other solutions end up being anti-consumer, compromise security, and/or don’t work. I detest that.\n\nOf course at the same time, I hate the opposite extreme: A game where cheaters abound, the dev/publisher DGAF, and your legitimate effort is a drop in the ocean.  For the minority to whom this matters, like myself, it's a dealbreaker.\n\nLike, I recently had to contend with this in the PC release of _Earth Defense Force 6._  I eventually reached a point where I just didn't care if people used autoloot cheats.  It was very lucky indeed that players could be identified by nationality, as being able to avoid Chinese gamers reduced my personal encounters with cheaters by like 98%.\n\nMost people who care about competitive games don’t give a shit about kernel access, I sure as hell don’t and can’t wait for it to become the norm. Valorant is the only competitive FPS where you can actually enjoy ranked at a high level without constantly having to worry about whether or not someone will suddenly toggle their cheats on halfway through the match to avoid losing.\n\n90% of the time I read people’s negative opinions on kernel anti-cheats it’s people who don’t even play competitive games, and the other 10% are people who aren’t even ranked highly enough for it to be a real concern.\n\nCan you explain the relationship, what is the context?\n\nYeah I  have been gaming on Linux since proton was first launched it seems recently many developers are having a vendetta against Tux and the steam deck  this is definitely good \n\nRockstar enabled battle eye and didn't support Linux. \n\nRiot added anticheat to league no Linux support \n\nApex legends added anticheat no Linux support anymore \n\nConcord added a specific error message if you try and play on Linux\n\nDesktop Linux user here who has no interest in the SD. This is an extremely good change. Even though I've no interest in owning a SD, I will be eternally grateful to Valve for making it due to it skyrocketing Linux gaming popularity compared to how it used to be.\n\n[deleted]\n\nnice, gabe making all the right moves lately fr\n\nlately? We're only where we are cuz he's been making good moves for a while\n\n20+ years.\n\nBe Gaben\n\nLook at video game service market\n\nSee competitors shoot themselves in the foot through short term greed\n\nChoose to produce something targeting value for the consumers\n\nConsumers happy\n\nRinse, repeat\n\nSince steam machines Valve is the only reason there are even games made for Linux and gaming  and wine and dxvk are in the state they are in currently.\n\nPoor Artifact forgotten as always.\n\nBlessed be Gaben\n\nOur Gabe, who art in Bellvue, Hallowed be thy games. Thy steamdeck come, thy will be done on the move as it is at home. Give us this linux our daily driver and forgive us our rage as we forgive those who rage against us and lead us not into piracy, but deliver us with sales. Gaben.\n\nNot fully if they can just add it in a month after launch. They have been adding this in to things years later.  That should never be allowed unless you can get a refund for it from every place it can be sold not just steam. People that use third party stores would still get screwed.\n\n&gt;\"This one specific platform requires developers to disclose kernel level anti-cheat\"\n\n&gt;\"YEAH BUT WHAT ABOUT OTHER PLATFORMS????\"\n\n...?\n\nGabe can't control the policies of other platforms. As for \"just adding it a month after launch\", they'd still have to disclose it for future sales, and often in cases like that where the product has been modified significantly, you *can* request a refund from Steam support and it has a very high probability of being approved.\n\nGood i hate having to install kernal anticheat it feels like a violation giving anything that much access i mean what if someone hacks the anticheat you are fully boned. Equally playing tarkov/roblox they have to do somthing to make the game fair as there are clear hacks going on.\n\n\n\nBlew my mind that evan for GTA 5 campaign i needed to install anticheat\n\n[removed]\n\nFor single players it's blows my mind as most games work with nexus mods. \n\n tbf I'm moving to gog due to this bullshit steam can pull the game you don't own it just a licence which is a goddam con when you have like 1000s of pounds worth of basically rented games pisses me off. \n\nGog have put it in black and white you buy the game the game is yours.\n\nGOG is still technically in the business of selling licences, though obviously in a more consumer-friendly way. That said, it's still digital copies and 1000s of pounds worth of games installers are gonna require 1000s of GB of local storage, which is not nearly as realistic to the average gamer as a shelf of DVDs used to be.\n\nHey you could always put them into blue rays yourself and then put them on the shelf! \n\nWell, if the game fits, i suppose..\n\nBlu-ray disks are something like 27.6GB. 4K blu-rays are twice as large I believe. Not the worst option!\n\nA year ago, I'd reply that that too, is expensive. Today, though, we know that Sony is slowly shutting down production of blank Blu-ray discs. \n\nFunnily enough, they developed super large discs as well (~200 GB IIRC), but there was no percieved market for them, just like for the classic ones.\n\nThe games you buy on GOG are not yours, you can just download an offline installer and that's it, which is a far cry from what you can do with old PC games on a physical media.\n\nor you could buy the games on steam and just download a copy to save from distribution websites\n\nFor single player it's bonkers. Like why does anyone care whether I cheat alone in my house so much as to demand control over my computer to ensure that doesn't happen?\n\nIt'd make sense if they have microtransactions.\n\n[deleted]\n\nAnticheat programs are doomed at a fundamental level.  Their purpose is to make multiplayer clients trustworthy, which is impossible.  Focus on making the client as *dumb* as possible and doing everything that matters server side, the cloud gaming platforms show there's no hard limit on how far you can take that.\n\nI think the security is fine, for me it's that if they patch in a bug it can basically brick your pc.\n\nYeah I'm in the same boat I don't like it but cheaters just straight up ruin games so it's tough\n\nYou could only really justify it if the anti-cheat actually worked. it doesn't. There are still cheaters in all those games lol\n\nKernel access is unjustified tho. It doesn't make it more efficient to have that kind of privilege. And no, i'm not saying \"muh there's still cheaters\". What i mean is, it would be like putting security cameras pointed at your bed, front door, shower and toilets in order to make sure nobody breaks in by the front door.\n\nA normal anti cheat has the same exact privileges as a kernel level anti cheat, they both can do whatever they want, any app can do whatever it wants, you should read up on UAC prompts and what they do.\n\n\n\n\nThe only difference between a kernel level anti cheat and non-kernel one isn't security or privacy or access, it's that a kernel AC can actually see what's running in the kernel, the kernel was created to protect certain system components and it was made so it's hidden from normal apps in higher rings but once viruses and cheats started using it to hide anti viruses and anti cheats both moved there to combat them, but as far as going through your files and data, kernel access hasn't changed anything, Valve's anti cheat can search your browser history and it's ring 3, the furthest ring from the kernel, and this is only what we know for a fact, it can do a lot more.\n\nClientside anticheats in general do nothing against cheaters anyways.\n\nHave you tried playing any mildly popular game and the play CS2 which doesn't have a kernel level anti cheat? You'll go from 1 cheater every 20-30 matches to a cheater practically every match, and guess what's the least cheater infested place in CS2... Private servers protected by kernel level anti cheats, yeah I'll still take a little bit of cheating over practically unplayable games.\n\nThe day that Steam goes public is the day that PC gaming dies. They are the last bastion of consumer rights in gaming.\n\n&gt; They are the last bastion of consumer rights in gaming.\n\nLiterally GOG sitting there being anti-DRM as fuck, something that Steam openly embraces the shit out of. \n\nBro. GOG is *the* consumer rights store and platform in PC gaming. They sell you files that are *yours*, no DRM bullshit which is flagrantly anti-consumer.\n\nGOG is cool too, but they're a small fry and publishers that dont want to play by their rules can just not sell with them. Publishers NEED to sell on Steam, so Steam's rules are more impactful. Publishers have tried leaving steam, but that did not go well for them.\n\nPraise be.\n\nUnder his eye\n\nIn His Divine Shadow\n\nCan we just be happy that we can deal with GOG and Steam, but not have to deal with Origin or UPlay if we don't want to?\n\nOh, and Humble Bundle. Good for more than just games.\n\nSadly, plenty of games are exclusive to those platforms.\n\nthe point is some can succeed (Riot is doing completely fine on its own, a lot of china's stuff of course has always done so), and some dont(e.g Ubisoft and EA). The point is you either need to have a better user end service, or have a game that people are willing to leave a platform for to play.\n\nDevelopers can 100% have a platform, but they have to give an incentive for users to seek out the other platform. What's considered pro developer is not necessarily considered pro consumer and the reverse, and conflation of the two being one is why people argue about something that isn't the crux of the problem.\n\nI think there's a pretty huge difference between asking someone to go to a new store to buy the game there, compared to games like League that have a free installer to the game and then charge inside the game client.\n\nDon't use survivors bias as an excuse. Riot doing well doesn't mean anything when dozens of others fail.\n\nThis. GOG is great and all, but unless they can capture a significant chunk of the market, they are basically irrelevant in the publishing sphere. And until they can get a LOT more publishers to sign on to their no-DRM policy, it will stay that way.\n\nBasically, if the gaming market wants to promote GOG, it has to first reject DRM.\n\nNo DRM is better than any DRM, but steam's DRM is the least intrusive I've ever seen, and it allows publishers to feel safe putting their games on there. Steam is one of the main reasons for PC gaming's success and you could go your entire gaming life without even knowing it has DRM.\n\nSteam DRM and DRM from games on the steam platform are 2 very different things. Steam DRM is only for validating someone owns a game pretty much.\n\nValve even claims:\n&gt;The Steam DRM wrapper by itself is not an anti-piracy solution. The Steam DRM wrapper protects against extremely casual piracy (i.e. copying all game files to another computer) and has some obfuscation, but it is easily removed by a motivated attacker.\n\nVersus the DRM mandated by individual games sold through Steam which can be anything from no DRM to Valorant level DRM.\n\nHell it's not even mandatory, plenty of drm free indies on Steam.\n\nThere's a fly in your ointment. GOG Galaxy is unavoidably multiplayer  DRM.\n\nYup I was very dismayed to find out some of the games GOG sells requires their launcher to play multiplayer. I think Stardew Valley was one of them? Definitely not completely DRM-free.\n\nThat's less DRM and more the developers not providing their own multiplayer servers or enabling direct hosting.\n\ntbh Steam's DRM is not intrusive nor very effective, seems like it exists to let developers tell their investors they've added a DRM to their game without actually adding intrusive crap like Denuvo. While I'd rather DRM not to exist, since it's something that only affects legit users, I don't think it's much of an issue.\n\nThat said, I still prefer GOG selling you the files. It's the closest we can be to buying a DVD, where the game is yours forever and you don't depend on companies deciding whether you still own the game you paid for or not.\n\nIts the masterlock of drm, good enough to dissuade casual piracy and that's about all its good for.\n\nAnd tbh that's about all DRM needs to be. Just enough to dissuade the masses from doing it.\n\nSteam's own layer of DRM is optional. I like GOG and what they stand for, but overall Steam had a much bigger impact in gaming because they are willing to do small concessions like that.\n\nI don't think you technically own files.  Still better than Steam DRM games though.\n\nYou never did, since floppy disks where a thing\n\nGoG may ~~sell~~ license you files without *invasive* DRM but you do not own the game files. Even with GoG it is ultimately still a license. Is there an easy mechanism (DRM) for game publishers to enforce their license? No. Does it make it impossible to enforce? Nope. Copyright is a fickle mistress. \n\nAnd just so you know Steam will do the same thing as GoG if the license holder for the game decides to blatantly be anti-consumer if it’s within their power. Steam itself is DRM as they manage your license. Same with GoG.\n\nThe main difference is that with GoG the games, once downloaded, are not tied to any account. You can keep them, delete your GoG account, and the games will continue to work. With Steam, everything is tied to your account. If you lose that, your games are gone.\n\n&gt; With Steam, everything is tied to your account. If you lose that, your games are gone.\n\nThat's not completely true. Steam has fully DRM free games and they work almost identically to GoG games. The only real difference is that GoG provides an installer while for Steam DRM-free games you need to copy-paste the install folder.\n\nSteam DRM-free games are no worse from an ownership perspective than GoG DRM-free games.\n\nhttps://steam.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_DRM-free_games\n\nvalve might be better than the other giants but they are not saints\n\nThis is a dangerous narrative. \n\nMajority of \"pro consumer\" moves they took are either because EU forced them or for selfish reasons, like in this case because Steam Deck support\n\nYeah, we can see what valve really thinks from the monetization on their games.\n\nLike in every other big FPS game if you buy a weapon charm you can take that charm out of a weapon and put it on another one for free.\n\nValve charges money in cs2 if you want to remove a weapon charm without destroying it.\n\nIt's also worth remembering that time that Valve skipped hand in hand with Bethesda in trying to monetise mods for Skyrim back in 2015.\n\nThey only backtracked from that because everybody and their dog complained about it and pointed out the massive issues that would result like policing the content to ensure people were not stealing others work and getting paid for it, or selling customers content that could very easily break the next time they patched the game and the creator would be under no obligation to fix it etc.\n\nValve are an ok company, I love Steam as a service. But people idolise them to a ridiculous degree and forget that Steam's championed a lot of the shit people complain about today from DRM to DLC, Paid Mods, Early Access etc.\n\nThey get a pass because their software has enough good points that people forgive them for it, and most competitors end up shitting the bed trying to compete with them.\n\nLet's not forget that Valve originally began the whole Steam OS / Steam Machines thing in response to Windows 8 having the Microsoft Store.\n\nWindows 8 was obviously not a very good OS to say the least, but Valve's beef seemed to be purely that they'd have competition with another storefront.  It's not like they criticised Windows 7, where Steam-bought games ran all the same as they did on Windows 8.\n\nYes it's great that there's a choice of OSs, and some investment into Linux gaming with Proton etc..  But we can't pretend the idea wasn't mainly about promoting an ecosystem that binds you more into the Steam platform.\n\nIt's still pro consumer, and nothing nefarious about that. That's even something everything can benefit from, even people that aren't their customers.\n\nSure. I didn't say otherwise. Nor do I want to imply Steam is a bad company\n\nBut Steam has done it's fair share of anti consumer practices and putting the company on a pedestal for either being forced to change or because it changed for its own good, is not a healthy practice\n\nGetting dragged kicking and screaming isn't pro consumer\n\nIt took governments getting involved to bring things like refunds in. If they didn't get involved they wouldn't have done it\n\nI mean they already helped popularize lootboxes and microtractions. That consumer rights shipped along time ago. Also Australia forced Valve to do refunded.\n\nImagine if gabe made steam employee owned\n\nIt depends, do we like the stock enough? Every dime I have would go there.\n\nDoesn't matter. Eventually big companies would have a controlling share, because naturally big companies whose goal is to make obscene amounts of money from investing will have a lot more money to invest than private individuals.\n\nNot worth it.\n\nIf they went public, I'd buy the stock. But still would know its at the loss one of the few companies that seem to actually care about my experience as a customer.\n\nNot just video games too. It feels like practically everything is out to get every little dollar out of your pocket by any means necessary.\n\nThe moon?\n\nWe're taking that stock to Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri.\n\nA billion dollar company that rents you games is in no way the last bastion of concusmer rights\n\nSteam def won't be going public\n\n[deleted]\n\n[deleted]\n\nI've seen this on this sub at least 3 times this week\n\nThis is the first time I’ve seen it.\n\nCommon Steam W.\n\nAlright nice, now give cs a better anti cheat.\n\nLet's see Paul Allen's anticheat\n\nNice, easier way to see which games not to buy. Especially if the game isn't PvP, and has no excuse to use this nonsense, like Helldivers 2\n\nAfter the Crowdstrike antivirus fiasco I think MS is working harder on restricting kernel access. I wouldn't be surprised if some of those kernel anti-cheats stop working in a few Windows Update cycles.\n\nDo not hold your breath on this. \n\nMicrosoft might push for tighter restrictions, but they are going to face significant corporate pushback on any changes to kernel access. \n\nMicrosoft’s policy around the kernel has put them in a bad spot.\n\nI mean the crowdstrike issue happened because crowdstrike essentially did a workaround to avoid normal kernal-level railguards.\n\nThe EU kinda forced Microsofts' hands there. They got punished for putting up more barriers to kernel access\n\nThe EU is the ones who forced Microsoft to open up kernel access. It's not going away.\n\nNo lol, this has been how Windows has worked since before Windows was called Windows. Maybe the EU has mandated Microsoft allows equal access to kernel-mode drivers, but they definitely did not start this shit pattern, they are only making sure single companies don't get advantages because of it.\n\nHow many times is this shared\n\n11\n\nWhat happens to games that decide to change their anti cheat policy later on?\n\nYou can update your own store page, so I don’t see why you wouldn’t be able to update the statement\n\nThe issue is for the people who purchased the games before the change on Linux or did in app purchases in live service games thinking it would always support Linux\n\nYeah that’s a big problem that goes bigger than just kernel anti cheats. Look at what helldivers just did, with selling the game in countries that it then later revoked official access to via a new requirement. \n\nIt’s just down to individual publishers. We do need something done about it, but idk what. \n\nIf no linux support was indicated on the store page then that's on the customer. Steam deck verified doesn't mean that the game officially supports linux.\n\nWhat’s kernel mode anti cheat and why is it a big deal for gamers?\n\nYour CPU has a set of instructions that will do certain things.  Add a value, store a value, move a value, etc.\n\nSome of these commands can typically only be run by the operating system.  If a program contains these instructions, the CPU will read them but the instruction will fail to execute if a 'kernel bit' isn't sending a signal to the CPU.  This bit is normally only active while the operating system has control of the cpu and not when a generic program is running. \n\nKernel-level anti-cheat is basically giving software access to those special instructions.\n\nIn specific, those instructions typically involve interfacing with other hardware, and involve accessing memory outside the range of memory space allocated for your program.  That way you can't have your program look at what other programs in other parts of memory are doing.  Normally you send a request to the operating system to do something with the hardware, or read something in memory, and then the operating system interrupts the program, decides if you ought to be allowed to do that, and if the answer is yes, it does that thing or retrieves that information for your program and then disables the kernel bit and hands control back.\n\nWith kernel-level access, programs can run those instructions itself, and basically look at the entirety of your computer and interact with all your peripheral devices, no questions asked.\n\n[How a single bit shields your operating system](https://youtu.be/H4SDPLiUnv4?si=77e7QeCPRA7mgDA8) - Core Dumped video if you want some more detail.\n\nAlso. When a normal program crashes only the program dies. When something in Kernel mode fuckes up, the system will blue screen. Crowd strike knows a little something about that.\n\nSo basically that anti cheat can do anything including fucking up everything.\n\nI'm not going to say it's malware... but it has everything that malware wants to get access to.\n\nActually heck, I call Windows 10+ Malware at this point.  So Yeah. Everything at the kernel level is basically malware, except for the hardware drivers.\n\nfound this as I was close but not an expert\n\n\"Kernel mode anti-cheat is a technology that allows developers to detect and prevent cheating in virtual worlds by identifying malware and hacks directly on the computer. Kernel mode is a privileged state in an operating system (OS) that gives unrestricted access to hardware and system resources.\"\n\nThe kernel is the lowest level of your operating system. Kernel anti cheat is allowed to run \"legally\" at this level and therefore has far-reaching powers. If the anti cheat is now compromised, e.g. by hackers, you have a program that is allowed to operate in the deepest and most important area of your operating program.\n\nAt least that's how I understood it.\n\nOne thing I don't understand, isn't that the same case for cheaters too?\n\nThey basically running obscured program on a kernel level from a guy knowingly fucking others.\n\nIt pisses off cheaters who then vent on reddit..\n\nIt's wild to me that a developer that can't figure out how to count fake money server side is allowed to access the kernel of millions of computers they don't own.\n\nWhat happens if they add it after the fact? Retroactive refunds?\n\nDisclosure is always good. It's sad we even need such intrusive anticheat, but people really are the worst and love ruining every shooter in history.\n\nGood. I would avoid games with kernel anticheat because that's like spying and there's no guarantee the anticheat is safe from being compromised.\n\nCan I get an ELI5 please?\n\nIf games can access the kernel, they are basically as powerful as the operating system (Windows). They can communicate with every part of your PC, look at every program. \n\nSounds good, because if you are running a cheating program in the background, the game can detect it.\n\nIn practice, this can be very bad. It opens up a huge security hole, that malware can exploit. It is also means you are okay with having no privacy on your computer. Finally, kernel mode anti-cheat has known to make performance a lot worse. Pirated versions with the anti-cheat patched out run better.\n\n[deleted]\n\n\\[Everyone liked that\\]\n\nMight as well just call it the \"approved piracy seal\".\n\nAs they should.\n\n**Good.**\n\nThey should allow to fuss refunds for developers who break their games for Linux users well after release too.\n\n*Stares intensely at Space Marine 2*\n\nwhat happened to SM2?\n\nTo be fair, they never sold it as a Linux game.\n\nAnd EA WRC\n\nI have straight-up refused to purchase games I'd desperately love to play because of DRM. Looking at you, Marvels Midnight Suns. Fuck Denuvo.\n\nGood.\n\nWhat’s Kernel mode and why’s it matter\n\nWhat's this mean for the non computer savvy?\n\nIt's like the computer version of signing up for your local casual soccer league. So the league sends an agent to search your house, read your financial and medical records, and plant a GPS on your car to make doubly extra sure you aren't using performance enhancing drugs. \n\nThen you show up to the field and one of your opponents looks unnaturally ripped and has some obvious injection marks anyway.\n\nBasically kernel level anticheat means everything on your PC can be read by them and you have no guarantees on security. \n\nIt also historically does not stop cheating.\n\nGood\n\nI wonder if this will stop the people who are freaking out when one game they have says it has kernel anti cheat saying they quit it, while having a dozen other games with the same anti cheat... Nah prob not\n\nThat's pretty good IMo.\n\nI cant check right now but I wonder what the policy is for games like Halo MCC where the anticheat is optional if you're okay with just singlepalyer &amp; custom lobbies. So the game does indeed run on Proton (i imagine, never tested). Feels like that should at least get a mention, as opposed to the games where you literally can't run shit at all\n\nThey should also be held accountable for changing it down the line.\n\nI hope in the disclaimer they also have to explain how potentially harmful and dangerous it is.\n\nWhy have you posted a week-old article that has already been discussed a lot here?\n\nOMG, what shitty developer is in here downvoting everyone who is happy about this.\n\nThat's good. Games should have to disclose if they are secretly rootkits."

    "all_comment_text": "“Faces backlash” I’m sure he’s real tore up about it\n\nHe's actually probably sweating right now. Sony is in the steps of \"taking over\" Bungie development currently due to lack of performance, which they said they weren't going to do. The key reason? Mismanagement. If this were any other scenario I'd be sarcastic along with you because it'd be a joke that this guy would have to worry about anything. This time though, he's got the public and ex-employess painting a *huge* target on his back and telling Sony exactly why they should aim for it.\n\n\n\nEdit: People keep saying he has nothing to worry about. He's already being outed as spending insanely and boasting while his company sinks and bellyflops after essentially getting a goodwill loan to keep the lights on. If he gets fired, who's going to hire him?\n\nUnfortunately, I’m sure Pete will get a nice golden parachute when he gets the old “see ya later”.\n\nEdit: since this has some eyes on it. Fuck Pete Parsons. Destiny is my favorite franchise of all time. I’ve been playing since before I got married and I’ve been married for 10 years now, the devs at Bungie are some of the most awesome, invested people I’ve seen in the industry.\n\nThese executives get paid more to leave a company than I'll make in my lifetime. Insanity \n\nDon't you wish you could do your job badly enough to get paid millions of dollars to fuck off?\n\nSomeone once told me \"in this world you fail upwards\" and that seems truer and truer everyday\n\nIt still surprises me that a lot of people are under the delusion that the tech industry is a meritocracy\n\nMany 'meritocratic' hierarchies function under the Peter Principle.\n\nI've yet to work anywhere that doesn't; in my 30 years of employment it's been everywhere I've worked.\n\nIt's always just a few good middle management and then the grunts that keep the profits coming in.\n\nCEO is basically a job where you're sailing a ship across the ocean and being paid by the kilometer travelled.\n\nEven if you completely fuck up and have no idea where port is, you can still sail in a random direction and make millions before you hit something. \n\nMeanwhile the developer jobs are the same but they're sailing a cruise ship down a river.\n\nIt is weird how humans have made a world for ourselves where jobs get easier the higher up in a company you get, rather than higher risk / more skill meaning more pay.\n\n&gt; It is weird how humans have made a world for ourselves where jobs get easier the higher up in a company you get, rather than higher risk / more skill meaning more pay.\n\n\nMostly the people who get those jobs are wealthy and usually come from a lot of family money too, it's so wealthy people can have cushy jobs that guarantee them even more wealth and easy living. Those jobs are easy when you compare how much pay you make for thinking about what is good for the business and then making a choice about it ( executives also follow trends \"copying each others homework\" ). On top of the fact they still get paid a lottery jackpot sized payout regardless of how good they were.\n\nEdit: Executive jobs are not much harder than a lot of other higher up roles, they are basically attending long boring meetings all day every day forever and they live in excel spread sheets. Sure they are \"busy\" but not busier than any manager wearing 10 different hats and not being paid enough for it. At the end of the day whatever decision they make, they still get paid for it and then move on to another company after a couple years of investing and taking a vacation once their tenure has ended.\n\nHe doesn’t need it, that’s kind of the problem.\n\nDoesn't need it and he'll *still* get it anyway.\n\nYeah, just another symptom of the disease.\n\nThe fish rots from the head, so they say. So I'm thinking, why not cut off the head?\n\n&gt;Destiny is my favorite franchise of all time.\n\n&gt;I’ve been playing since before I got married and I’ve been married for 10 years now,\n\nDestiny is not....\n\nOh fuuuuuccckkk me\n\nYa. I had this realization too. Welcome to old age, friend.\n\nYeah, dude isn't sweating shit. \n\nHe's spending 2.4 million on cars, he doesn't have to care about what a bunch of angry gamers he will never meet think about him.\n\nThe problem with modern compensation packages is that being publicly fired from your CEO position has no material effect on your wants and needs.\n\nThis is what pisses me off so much about these chucklefucks. Yes, this dude sucks and might lose his job for sucking, but he will never have to worry about food scarcity or housing. He never has to worry about education for his kids, medical expenses, or anything else that is a worry for normal people whom his shitty decisions effected.\n\nIn short, he is fully insulated from the results of his actions. This sucks and is a failing of our society.\n\n&gt; being publicly fired from your CEO position has no material effect on your wants and needs.\n\nIt has very little effect on future employment for them, either.\n\nI remember seeing this interview with a CEO a few years back who said something along the lines of \"Regarding CEO pay, I think its justified. People don't understand the pressure that CEOs are subjected to and just how stressful and difficult it is knowing that if you make a bad decision you can drive the company to ruin and it will be your own fault. I have known other CEOs to be brought to tears due to the stress of the job\". \n\n.... as if people aren't regularly stressed to the extreme over work, or its not that common for someone to end up crying due to things going badly at work. Especially if they got fired because the CEO figured the company would be better off and more profitable with an overworked skeletal crew.\n\nI'm a nurse in a long term facility. My decisions have impact on whether someone lives or dies. \n\n\nI make $40/ hr.\n\n\nThis guy collects millions and does nothing even remotely close to the stress normal folk have every fucking day. \n\n&gt;This guy collects millions and does nothing even remotely close to the stress normal folk have every fucking day. \n\nAs a school bus driver, who makes $26/hr, I second this accusation.\n\nWell fucking put\n\nOh, poor baby. \n\nPeople with the most basic jobs in an organization are often driven to tears. The difference is this cock oven isn’t going home to hungry kids, nor a 10-day shut-off notice for their heat in the winter. \n\nIt’s tempting to call it zero self-awareness, but it’s actually lying, pandering bullshit.   \n\nCEO's cry because the company they are running is failing and it's looks bad.   They cry because they're humiliated in front of their buddies at the boat club.\n\nNormal people cry over work because they could get laid off and watch as their kid is forced to live out of a car.\n\nIt's hard to choose between taking your Ferrari or Lamborghini to your second vacation home when you're all stressed out about everyone else doing all the real work,  okay.  You just don't get it.\n\nChrist what an asshole.  The last retail job I had, the front end supervisor was the kindest, sweetest woman.  She was 'brought to tears' regularly by the biggest raging cunt of a store manager I've ever seen over super important stuff like not making her cashiers smile more, or not being domineering enough over bathroom breaks or other stupid ass bullshit.\n\nWhat I wouldn't give to make that CEO work her job and see how he likes it.  Take away all his money so he has to choose between daily emotional abuse for pennies or being homeless and then let's see how justified he thinks his former salary was.\n\nTo be fair, it's a failing of our society that anyone needs to worry about those things. It's just galling that the people who cause those issues are never the ones suffering from them.\n\nI really wish we had alternatives so life didnt have to be just a struggle to live and pay rent\n\ni'd be honestly fine with that if the amount of money they get was ever equal to the value of work they'd done for society. sadly its never that simple, the most value work is almost always underpaid or in a loop of profits being invested right back into that work\n\nIt’s worse, the next company will hire him and pay even more. Don’t know why that is.\n\nGuess you never heard of Bobby Kotick. These type of people literally don't give a shit as long as they get paid. If he cared at all, he'd be like Swen Vincke of Larian Games, but no, he was spending millions on classic cars while his employees were dropping like flies. He's probably sweating in the sauna he bought for firing these people.\n\n[removed]\n\nThe real concern - shareholders and executives are painting a target on him. If they fuck their employees over, their client and customers over, the general public over - cost of doing business. If they fuck their shareholders over, it’s game over, even if they’re taking care of everyone else. Shareholder value above all else.\n\nIt’s almost like rampant capitalism constantly being deregulated does not produce high quality CEOs. Who in the world could have ever seen this coming?\n\nProbably as sad as Bobby K was about how disliked he was.\n\nHey! I've seen lots of meanly worded Reddit comments. He better look out.\n\nHow would he ever sleep at night? imagine the consequences?\n\nProbably laughing about it as he drives his expensive classic convertibles.\n\nI’m sure the company email he had chatGPT write was very thoughtful though.\n\nI worked at a game company where the CFO had to be specifically told to stop driving his insanely expensive cars to work every day because it was bad for morale\n\nReminds me of the first job I got out of college. It was at an energy tech company. They were paying everyone drastically below industry standard, and then all upper level guys were driving these expensive fucking Mercedes. The kicker was when you walked into the office there was a giant poster ad for a Mercedes dealership. Saying *company name* employees get 10% off. Shit was so demoralizing.\n\n“So you’re saying I need to buy and drive a top trim Camry that tops out at $40k instead? Wtf this sucks!”\n\n\"You mean I have to drive my brand new Subaru instead of my Bently??? People are gonna think I'm poor!\"\n\nThis actually isn't far from the truth. \n\nUse to work for a small pharmaceutical R&amp;d company and the owner said he *had* to have a nice car so when investors show up, he looks \"successful\".  The last one he bought was a 2018 BMW 650i xDrive Convertible. The kicker was he would complain to us about how he was living paycheck to paycheck and how the company wasn't making enough to give us a raise. \n\nThese people are the worst. It honestly took longer than we expected to see him get punched in the face by an employee who hadn't got a raise in 7 years.... Which also happened to be his brother-in-law.\n\nWhen my grandpa started selling insurance in the '80s one of his bosses told him to get a nicer car and start wearing an expensive watch because customers wouldn't trust him if they thought he was poor.\n\nIt's the consumerist culture that makes people that can barely afford rent get the latest iPhone. All to sell the image that you can.\n\nBoiler room sales culture bullshit.\n\nWhat? No it isn’t.\n\nHow you present yourself 100% matters in most professional places. Especially sales.\n\nGet off of Reddit and go into the real world.\n\nI’m not defending CEOs pay but what they wear and drive DO affect things.\n\nSame with literally almost every professional.\n\n\"Why don't they just get expensive cars too?\"\n\nLet them eat cake! (The cake is a lie)\n\nUhh yo what this means is that you can drive a car up to $150K.\n\nJust stop bringing your $5m, and $25m ultra rare only 25 made in the world shit around here.\n\nMy ex gf worked for weed delivery app as a dev. The owner would roll up in his new Rolls Royce. She was friends with the personal assistant and she told her that he was instructed to drive a new car. Since the Rolls was super flashy and most employees were fairly entry level. Instead he parked it further away.\n\nWeed delivery app...?\n\nyeah its a thing lol. in the us, some states have made recreational cannabis use legal. so, some of the dispensaries and other services offer order pickup and delivery. you still have to verify your identity and all that on delivery and it has to be hand delivered but you get the point\n\nWow sounds interesting. Not interested in weed, but cool.\n\nIt’s a pretty diverse industry. From delivery driver and retail associate up to geneticist and some pretty high tech stuff. I interviewed for a DE role at farm that was doing breeding and had a team of botanists and geneticists that needed tons of data support for their work. Then all the ancillary business: marketing, land management, trucking, construction, banking, etc.\n\nThey should really respect the people that actualize their business instead of treating them like a copy machine.\n\nThey have no incentive to sadly\n\nthis is a thing. there was a story about how the most common mega rich person typically choses to drive a toyota land cruiser to work to not seem so out of touch. might have been a lexus gx but you get the point.\n\nBezos drove a Toyota while he was mega rich. But that was when he was still married to his (lovely) ex-wife, before his villain arc, midlife crisis and stripper dating\n\nI think the point was land cruiser is very expensive and its also pretty expensive to run.\n\nYup. Worked in games for a while. Once we lost our publisher, these 2 ceos showed up out of nowhere. One drove a ferrari, the other guy had a 30k watch. One of them bragged they could keep the company going for a year with his savings (people at this company had worked there for years with no raises whatsoever). Surprise surprise they closed the studio 2 months after that and blamed it on covid.\n\nI feel like this kind of news story is common enough that I’ve seen your comment before.\n\nWhy not get rid of the guy altogether, then? That would surely 'boost morale'.\n\nCan’t answer that, I was one of the plebs they worried might lose morale if they saw how much better he got paid. They made him CEO instead of getting rid of him though\n\nBecause the ones that told him had expensive cars of their own that they kept at home\n\nHe has every kind of classic car.\n\nTriples of the Barracuda \n\nTriples is best, triples is safe\n\nBut he *has* a wife\n\nAnd SHE asked him marry HER.\n\nAnd she's beautiful, but she's dying...\n\nShe's sick, but she's hanging in there.\n\nTell the kid!\n\nShe’s sick. But she’s gonna get better.\n\nTriples of the roadrunner\n\nand triples of the nova\n\nand triples of the road runner.\n\nHe's also got a weird thing for inviting employees over to look at his cars. A few female employees have come forward about it and one employee talked about him doing it while the employees were talking about how to put bread on the table. \n\nMan walked over to two people talking about being underpaid and asked if they wanted to see his vintage car collection\n\n“They must be feeling bad about going hungry. I know! A quick look at my collection will do the trick!”\n\nIt's better than food too because food only keeps you fed for a day, but a look at the classic cars feeds your soul for a lifetime.\n\n“Classic Cars for the Soul” is the new “Chicken Soup for the Soul”\n\nAssert dominance try to eat the car\n\nA car is very rich in iron.\n\nLmao\n\nI once had a regional manager show a room of underpaid assistant managers his check to I think inspire us? But oh man it was infuriating cause he was either obtuse or an asshole, maybe both.\n\nThat's right, all 15 of you can also have this one day, except you can't because there is only one position and i have it already.\n\nYah that was the kicker, plus he knew the owner of the company which is basically why he had the job. Gotta be rich to get rich.\n\nThe classic \"with hard work you two can end up in my position, except you won't because we like it up here and plan on dying up here\"\n\nHow does anyone think that's a good idea ? Let me guess,  he also tells employees not to discuss how much they make with each other?\n\n\nIt's like my aunt, she's rich because she's a gold digger and when my mom was over (my mom is very poor) asks her \"Do you want to see how much money I make a month ?\"\n\n\nOf course she's the only one thinking about what to do with my grandma's house when she dies when no other family members are even thinking about that. She also visits and helps out the least. \n\n\nMoney ruined her. My mom told her the house was going to me (it isn't) and she flew into a fit if rage. I used to like her better when she was a meth addict.\n\nI feel like she was ruined before the money\n\nYeah, you'd think that when you hear meth but at least she was compassionate and just had her own problems. She stayed with an awful man for his money and pushed away her son and he passed away, So essentially she chose money over her son (without knowing) and just hasn't been the same since. Has embraced being rich though I have a feeling her current husband is just gold digging her so, what comes around...\n\n[deleted]\n\nYeah. The wonders of inheriting apartment compounds in a very rich area. She still has to kind of manage things but I think she just found some guy to do that and cut his rent down a lot.\n\n&gt;How does anyone think that's a good idea ? Let me guess,  he also tells employees not to discuss how much they make with each other?\n\nUnfortunately you can be dumb as a bag of shit and half as useful, but still be rich. It's debatable that most of the wealthy people in the world are utterly useless, out-of-touch morons: Hell, just look at how many were born on third base but rabidly defend that they earned it. The cleverer chunk of them are rarely any sort of genius so much as scammers who aren't *technically* breaking any laws, they're just utilizing their complete lack of morals, like your aunt there.\n\nAt a job I had a long time ago, we had layoffs that affected 20% of the team or so. The following Monday, the director makes the entire team come out and look at her new Mercedes. She was a psychopath, so it tracks.\n\nI had a boss like this once. They took a guy out to lunch to let him know he was going to be terminated and the whole time the CEO and the CFO were arguing about whose house was bigger. Couldn’t wait to get out of that company.\n\nWorked for a company that the owners did the same. Bought cars through Covid and properties oversees (site unseen) and then 40% of the team\nWas laid off due to budget constraints. They always brought up their toys in conversation around the office. Even got their vaccines early to go see the properties.\n\nThen the rest of the employees motivation plummeted and everyone was working for 2-3 people until the rest of the team crumbled and left for greener pastures.\n\nYou’re supposed to say: triples is best.\n\nBut his wife’s sick\n\nShe's going to make it.  Tell the kid she's going to be OK.\n\nShe’s beautiful, but she’s dying\n\nAnd he’s rich. And he doesn’t live in a hotel.\n\nHe has doubles of every classic car. Actually, he has triples. Triples is best.\n\nHis wife is also a supermodel, and he didn't EVEN wanna marry her!\n\nTell the kid\n\nThat way he can drive one and know he has a prestige one in storage. Then, if one gets scratched it’s ok, he doesn’t have to care.\n\nDoes he have doubles?\n\nTriples is best. Triples is safe.\n\nAnd he doesn’t live in a hotel.\n\nthe bungie of today are not the ones who came up with marathon and Halo, that has long since passed.\n\nIt's heartbreaking really\n\nA lot changes in a quarter of a century \n\nSame story at Blizzard. The souls is gone and it’s just about the money now\n\nThe suits kill everything beautiful\n\nThe moment a thing becomes successful or gains a reputation, it draws the eyes of those looking to exploit that.\n\nThe second there's shareholders involved, the joy is dead.\n\nits the same at bioware right?\n\nEvery single successful game studio.\n\nFrom software, id, naughty dog, Santa Monica. Some studios did not cash out.\n\nYeah don't become a public IP or sell to company with investors. Larian shows that too with BG3.\n\ni think the internal dev teams have gotten better at blizzard but the execs are just as bad as they have ever been and they control the greedy decisions\n\nSame thing happened with Dice. Pretty sad that 2042 was so bad…\n\nThey might be the ones that made Oni\n\nThey went down the live service route and lost their soul in the process.\n\nThe final shape was decent, but then the devs of it were all fired\n\nFood: 300\n\nUtilities: 200\n\nRent: 2,000\n\nVintage Cars: 2,400,000\n\nMisc: 50\n\nGuys please help me manage my finances, my game studio can't afford to keep all its employees\n\nHave you considered not eating\n\nJust stop buying latte and guacamole sandwiches\n\nStop buying vintage cars\n\nNo\n\nYou’re fired\n\nEase up on the avocado toast buddy, let's try get that 300 food bill to 280.\n\nCan you explain the 50 misc? Maybe start a spending journal to properly log all your outgoings, make sure to cut all essential spending, try do away with the streaming subscriptions. \n\nCan you move to an area with lower rent? Or if you maybe have a spare bedroom you can get a roommate, get that rent to 1000.\n\nTwo executives did get laid off. \n\nMark noseworthy and Luke smith.\n\nhttps://x.com/paultassi/status/1819184989122224179?s=46\n\nLuke Smith weaseling his way into an exec role will never not be funny.\n\nI grew up reading his Halo 3 community updates as \"Lukems\" and his community engagement was honestly fantastic.\n\n\nHe was in some Halo:Reach vid docs and seemed engaged and having fun in them.\n\n\n And somehow got promoted to higher and higher roles. \n\n\n I stopped playing destiny and sold my copy the day he came out with his \"You'll throw money at the screen for these emotes!\" shit. \n\n\n Bungie totally lost me that day, and it was clear they were not the company I grew up with. \n\n\n\n This is coming from the guy with a Halo 3 poster in my living room, the art of halo 3, the graphic novel etc.\n\n\n\nGuy might be a decent dude, but Bungie doing a 180 since their 7/7 Bungie day times really sucked and made me leave.\n\nHim and Frank O'Connor both, literally how?\n\nIt seems like the whole cashier to manager at a chain restaurant.\n\n\nBy process of attrition they end up being in management.\n\n\nBut also whoever promoted them was a grade A goober\n\nI remember him at 1up, never liked him much back then.   \n\nI was surprised when he was promoted from a glorified forum mod and amazed to hear he’s still stealing a living.\n\nThe scarab lord himself. His vision for the game was always gindy and elitist.\n\nThings to remember when your employer asks you to sacrifice.  Leave at 5 and take all your vacation.  You are never gonna wish you worked harder for them.  This is how it is now.\n\nI worked 9 years for a company that somehow “never made enough for bonuses”. I recently found out they made millions in pure profit the last few years and I was promised 5% profit share as I was a founding employee of a startup. I’ve yet to see a dime. I’ve been looking for a new job for a month now.\n\nI’m guessing there’s no actual paperwork to show the “promise”?\n\nwith all due respect, 5% profit share is a shit ton of money, why would they even offer that? How come in your position with such a good promise, didnt realize the company was getting millions of profit?\n\nThe most rational conclusion is that he meant 5% of salary as bonus. 5k on 100k not too shabby.\n\n&gt; The most rational conclusion\n\nIs that he's a liar.\n\naverage reddit moment\n\nIf he's one of the first few partners to join the group, it's not unheard of, especially if their first few years were hilariously underpaid.  It's a commonly-used tactic among startups to use as a carrot to keep a few dedicated employees around to start building the company up.\n\nOnly problem is, if they haven't seen a dime, that means it was almost certainly never written down and signed.\n\nConsult with a lawyer in the meantime. Even if that promise was only made verbally, you might still have enough leverage for a case/settlement, especially if you have any proof past hearsay.\n\nExactly, my boomer co-worker always gave me shit for calling out and taking all my vacation and sick time. \n\nManagement couldn't give a fuck and literally were like yeah dude use your sick time. \n\nThen about 85% of the company got let go and he was tweaking about never getting his vacation or sick pay. \n\n  \nSucks to suck, it's not 1980 anymore my guy\n\nBro I am the only one who actually uses all their leave and like, what are my coworkers doing??\n\nMay this is a one of those \"weird\" European white collar things, but here if you haven't used up all your alloted annual leave come December, the manager calls you and tells you to fuck off on a winter holiday.\n\nOftentimes companies in December work on skeleton crews of the people who used up all their vacation days in the summer\n\nLol those types are the ones who let these people stay in charge\n\nThere's absolutely no reason to sacrifice at work and even more so at a company you don't own / share ownership of.\n\nSometimes I look at my bank account and  im like \"Damn my money never seems to go up.\" Then I remember I spend all my money and free time on my nieces and doing shit I enjoy and im actually happy. \n\n\nI know for sure I wont be on my death bed wishing I worked more.\n\nWhen people don’t take their full vacation time I’m like, “what is wrong with you?!”. Even if you just sit on your couch alone- that’s your freaking time. You earned it. You owe your company nothing.\n\nI've met a few people that can't deal with time off.  Taking unneeded time off makes them more stressed and miserable. They're absolute exceptions though\n\nTurns out corporations cold turn you to stone before you realize.\n\nI’m somewhat of a car collector myself\n\nHot Wheels or Matchbox?\n\nMicro machines\n\nNow we're talking\n\nMicro machines? Look at Mr. Moneybags over here\n\nI once had a classmate in I think the 3rd or 4th grade who stole a bunch of micro machines from me when he was over my house. I lost a fortune that day, and some would say that's made me bitter...\n\nIf I were on your jury, I'd acquit you.\n\nLmao\n\nTriples is best\n\nNot to be too obvious and cliche but the gaming industry has been taken over by greedy suits who don't make games to expand the art, improve the human experience, or put passion into the medium or the industry, they use games as a trojan horse to get users addicted to a product and sap as much cash from their wallet as possible.\n\nThat money isn't desired because it will pay well deserving game devs and make game development a stronger industry it's desired so that the cars, mansions, vacations, and country club memberships of the CEOs and shareholders can be paid for.\n\nThese people are parasites of society and they just flock to anything that becomes popular so they can leech off of it.\n\n&gt;the gaming industry has been taken over by greedy suits \n\nBuddy, it's been \"greedy suits\" the entire time. A few small sincere projects do not change the reality of what an industry has been. It's always been capitalism. The only respite from it is when business owners voluntarily choose not to pursue profit, but that is rare and dependent on the goodwill of someone who holds power. It's like a monarch choosing to be benevolent - yeah, it's nice when they do it, but the fact that they could *choose not to* makes it a systemic issue.\n\nAnd of all the different facets of capitalism, gaming is the least affected by it because you can simply choose to do something else. Compared to, say, landlords, a gaming company has almost no power over you.\n\nChrist these people need to be held accountable. That's garbage-tier human behavior.\n\nIt's a real politician's move. Vote for your own pay rise, forget the chumps you represent, then retire on a fat pension that most will struggle to get in their working lives. People born into money have no idea. People who grow into money soon forget what it's like to struggle, or feel empathy for the troops they cull.\n\nReminds me of The Platform on Netflix\n\nGreat movie\n\nThere’s a sequel on the way\n\n[deleted]\n\nAccountable for what? And how?\n\nWe dropped feudalism for the same thing with extra steps. The executive class has created this system where they act like they are vital to succeed and pass these jobs down to their kids or other executive class kids they know. Generational wealth is only a real thing for these people. Others can succeed in this system. But never at the level of these lazy fucks at the top.\n\n&gt; Christ these people need to be held accountable.\n\nThe CEO's #1 job is to make their company profitable and make shareholders happy.\n\nThat is the ONLY reason ANY company exists.\n\n[deleted]\n\nMy fav is some woman who worked there tweeted:\n\n'Real cool of you to invite me to see all your cars two days prior to laying me off with no warning.'\n\nI swear most CEOs and even a lot of executives are just an utter waste of money. Especially making millions or hundreds of millions. Insane.\n\nFrom Investopedia:\n\n&gt;The tech and entertainment conglomerate also said it plans to buy back up to 30 million shares of its own stock.\n\nSorry, folks, can't afford to pay you, we need to waste a couple billion dollars artificially pumping our stock price.\n\n&gt;\"faces backlash\" \n\n\nOh God no! Did people complain on Twitter or something? What a terrible punishment. I'm sure that he learned his lesson. \n\n“People who don’t matter to person criticize person who is not listening to them”\n\nI bet those people sure \"slammed\" him with their comments.\n\nI don’t give a shit how people spend their own money. \n\nContinuously upping already *outrageous* executive salaries while at the same time having mass layoffs is the problem. Executives should be having great paydays *when* the company is prosperous &amp; killing it. Anytime I hear mass layoffs &amp; don’t hear executive pay cuts in the same breath, I know it’s fucking fake &amp; it is an indictment against this corporatist bullshit that massive companies get away with every year.\n\n$2.4m is nothing in comparison to the wages of 220 people.\n\nCall me crazy, but I think a LOT of companies would perform a lot better if there wasn't such a huge disparities in payrolls. Like sure, you should get paid more for doing more work, and harder work, but the way it is now is just ridiculous.\n\nNot trying to defend the multi millionaire here but 2.4 million is not that much money. It probably wouldn't even pay all those 220 employees salaries for a month. The real problem is/was Bungie investing in other games besides Destiny. Marathon isn't happening, Bungie. Stop trying to make it happen. Move on, fully invest into your most successful IP instead of giga flops.\n\nYeah it says 2.4 million since September 2022, rounding that up to 2 years (not that it matters) is 1.2 million a year, across 220 employees  that's less than $5.5k/y...\n\nThat's 11k per person over the course of how many years?\n\nCEOs are bribed to FUCK OVER both the customer and the company for the sake of 3 month profits for share holders.  C-CLASS IS STRIP MINING OUR WORLD.\n\nThe core mechanism of capitalism is to take the value that workers create, give them a tiny fraction back, and keep the vast majority to funnel up to a handful of execs and stockholders. This is the exploitation of the workers.  This story is a particularly gross example.\n\nDoesn’t that break down to $5.5k per year per employee? His car collection didn’t kill jobs.\n\nYou have to have triples really, one for driving, one for show and one just in case. triples is best. Triples is safe.\n\nMan bungie sure fell off. Crazy how times change.\n\nThe spending isn't the problem. Once the money is in your wallet I don't care what you do with it. The earning is what's the problem. If the company is really in the kind of shape that these stories are making it seem like then he shouldn't have been making the kind of money that would allow him TO spend that kind of money on cars and shit."

I play it on Steam Deck.\n\nWhat kind of PC do you have right now? Does it have any decent gaming capabilities?\nLossless Scaling ($7) on Steam can give you frame generation on any game.\nIf your PC can hit 30-40 fps, you can triple that to 90 or so.\nAdds a bit of latency, but it's unnoticeable for the most part.\n\n Bruh you better upgrade or buy a ps5 before the trade tariffs kick in. \n\nInflation is about to go brrrrr on electronics.\n\n&gt; Remember kids the industrial military complex gets paid by the shot not the target\n\nMilitary Grade means built by the lowest bidder.\n\nTarget acquisition is on the user, not the weapon.\n\nHonestly, WTF did they think was gonna happen?\n\nYeah if you deploy planetary bombardment you don't also deploy yourself in the middle.\n\nHey can you not bring politics into my fascist colonial wargame please?  I like media without politics like Starship Troopers and Starwars.  ASMONGOLD 2028\n\nlmao\n\n“Even if I do a bad job they gotta pay me”\n\nAre we the Wagner baddies ?\n\nI don’t think helldiver players are that shocked, honestly\n\nJohn helldiver here.\n\n\nI'm not shocked \n\nHoly shit - pleasure to meet you john, big fan\n\nThis is like when I ran into George Halo:combatevolved.  Totally starstruck!\n\nOr the time when I met Henry The Legend of Zelda\n\nI think Halo is a pretty cool guy.\n\nEh kills aleins and doesn't afraid of anything.\n\nHas Anyone Really Been Far Even as Decided to Use Even Go Want to do Look More Like?\n\nHow are babby formed?\n\nWe need way to instain these comments\n\nI couldn’t even imagine!\n\nHey John, quick question- is it the kind of game I can casually log onto, okay a few matches and bounce? Or will that enrage others with my lack of ability willingness to grind and practice?\n\nTy\n\nNo one who plays with strangers cares if they leave after a mission. Leaving during one is annoying, though. Missions are either 12 or 40 minutes long (but could be finished more quickly depending on difficulty level and squad competence) and you can choose a 12 minute one if you're pressed for time.\n\nIt's co-op and there are difficulty levels you can select when matchmaking. If you're gonna be super casual about it then stick to difficulty 6 or below and and you'll be fine.\n\nI haven't played in a while so I\"m just learning about this here, but I gotta say, indiscriminate killing feels fitting for Helldivers.\n\n↑→↓↓↓\n\nHonestly, it feels very in character for Super Earth to shell like this and I kind of think it's on purpose.  \nAfter all these gunners are civilians that have been pressed into crewing these weapons with less than a day of prep, and to Super Earth the Helldivers are very expendable.   \n\nIt does however not translate to the most fun gameplay, and even if your entire team wears heavy explosive resistant armour you'll still die from the occasional direct hit.\n\nPlot twist: the crew become (or already are) disillusioned with managed democracy and sympathetic to our enemies, they mutiny and helldivers storming the DSS becomes a set of missions \n\nA rebellion story arc would be pretty cool imo. Cliche sure but could be fun\n\nWasn't that the bots plot in 1?\n\nAndroids were 2nd class citizens and rose up.\n\nBots were made to put them down.\n\nBots, 100 years later, want recognition.....\n\n&gt; Honestly, it feels very in character for Super Earth to shell like this and I kind of think it's on purpose.\n\n&gt; It does however not translate to the most fun gameplay\n\nthat could be fun. the problem is that they didn't think through the implementation. assets only exist when players are near them, so this supposedly global rain of ordinance is actually just a rain cloud directly over the players' heads. \n\nthey need a system to reflect the ongoing attrition the enemy is experiencing that the current system for spawning doesn't account for. enemies calling for reinforcements should sometimes fail because the reinforcements are already dead, players should roll up to find a base already heavily damaged. the mission should be easier with surviving the barrage offsetting that.\n\nDrop with a shield. They can tank a direct hit.\n\nI GENUINELY love that it kills indiscriminately. What an amazing play by the devs. \n\nI hope they don't crack to pressure and instead double down. This is amazing. \n\n\"Are we the baddies?\"\n\nIt's completely in character for this game. Like, hands down it fits with the entire schtick. I love it.\n\nI feel like Helldivers really got screwed over by its popularity. It's clearly supposed to be a game where occasional random deaths are *part of the fun*.\n\nThe fact that there are so many ways to die from friendly fire is not supposed to be some ultra-sweaty difficulty-fetishism thing. It's there to give you a laugh when your friend says \"I got them\" and you say \"No, wai-\" and then ragdoll across the screen. If it were just about forcing you to be really careful and punishing mistakes, they wouldn't give you a bunch of extra lives. It's not exactly subtle about any of this in its presentation either.\n\nEven to the extent that the higher difficulties are there for sweatier play, they're supposed to be sweaty in part because you have to prevail despite how unfair it is. It's Starship Troopers rookies vs skeleton robots with chainsaw arms and laser eyes, and the sense of accomplishment is from managing to scrape out a victory despite the relentless onslaught of complete horseshit, not from a guarantee that if you are careful and methodical enough you shouldn't ever die.\n\nRespect to Arrowhead for swinging for the fences with an insane gameplay idea, but with all due respect - thanks to Helldivers 2 unexpected popularity, most of the actual players are not up for or open to crazy shit like that.\n\nNot shocked it is killing me, I'm shocked it is useless at doing anything OTHER than killing me\n\nAt least it’s killing something \n\nRun INTO the enemies not away from them. Take them with you. It’s the explosive hug of democracy.\n\nThat was since release. Run to edge of the map, get labelled as a deserter and run to enemies(or kite them)\n\n*I’m doing my part!*\n\nThe Deserter Barrage at least has a pattern that you can exploit. The DSS is just random.\n\nHonestly, that is a developer gag worthy of the early Fallout games.\n\nWe still haven't seen what the Eagle Storm actually does, and in theory we can use it to quickly perform gambits or blockade the bugs/bots from attacking other planets.\n\nThe Planetary Bombardment absolutely sucks though. They do need to tweak the hell out of it.\n\nWhen I see \"orbital bombardment\" on Stellaris or other scifi games, I generally imagine ship dropping nuke-style bombs, not those peashooters the DSS is using, but maybe it's just me .\n\nDont need nukes in orbital bombardment. Just a waste of funds. What you need is mass. A decent size rock will do just as well as a nuke.\n\n[Rods from God](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_bombardment).\n\nIn Rod We Trust\n\nFor being a Fascist, expansionist empire, the Helldivers are hilariously underpowered.\n\nA 500 pound bomb? That's cute, where's the Rhode Island sized carrier that warps above a combat zone, opens 8 square miles worth of bomb doors, and removes an entire strategic map from the game?\n\nOur carriers have less firepower than a real life AC-130. \n\nOur enemies literally did not have air power at the beginning. Where's our air dominance!\n\n500 kg bomb, but yes.\n\nAlso, the fact that they are underpowered is intentional.\n\nCan't keep the entire population under a war economy and war time controls if the war....ends, right?\n\nSo you equip your military with equipment that is juuusssttt good enough, while still ensuring lots of casualties to drum up support for the war at home, and lots of material requirements to keep the factories busy\n\nLook we can only estimate effectiveness from visually confirmed loss data, and the only visually confirmed losses we have are from Helldiver helmet cams...\n\nI’m not. I’d be more shocked if it didn’t. \n\nIt’s very on brand for the lore lmao\n\nOh, the subreddit is lousy with people missing the obvious humor of it.\n\n\n\nIt's a royal pain in the ass when playing and clearly (hopefully?) not working as intended, but it's doing *exactly* what was on the tin; bombarding the combat zone from orbit.\n\nYou should take a look at their subreddit, then. \n\nHalf of them are in fullblown meltdown mode. The rant megathread has absolutely *exploded* with comments about how people are going to quit the game over this lmao. It's hilarious.\n\n&gt; Half of them are in fullblown meltdown mode.\n\nHalf of gaming subreddits are in fullblown meltdown as a norm, tbh.\n\nI like to think it's a rage flu that goes from game reddit to game reddit.\n\nYeah I've been watching Rocket League die about 48 times now. \n\nAnytime there's a new change:\n\n\"This is the end of the game!\"\n\n\"It's ruined!\"\n\n\"You dug your own grave!\"\n\nGigachad meme: See ball hit ball\n\nThe primary Helldiver subreddit is...very not chill. Also fairly bad at the game on average.\n\nAnd also grinds like it's an MMO at times. I'm max'd everything and that's just because it's a super-low commitment game to jump into and have epic stuff happen. Like it's a really great \"I was at work all day and don't want to think too hard\" game. \n\nAlso you can just like...not dive the DSS planet at the moment.\n\nYeah its pretty pathetic. Rather than making their complaints known and taking it as the funny event that it is and just going to another planet for a bit they'd just rage on reddit. Usually why I don't follow a game's primary subreddit.\n\nMy teammates are hella shocked. Because the morons keep walking into my telsa towers placed in the open.\n\nmany of them are truly in denial, it's a blast 😅\n\nWhat does your title mean\n\nIt's phrased as irony. The verb \"shocked\" is ironic given the provided context that a superweapon *obviously* will kill indiscriminately.\n\nNgl, it caught me off guard when I hopped on this morning. Got the full Death Korps Of Kreig experience and was laughing the entire time\n\nSir,  the artillery bombardment is starting! We must retreat!\n\n\nNah,  I have my shovel. See you on the other side, heretic!\n\nKrieg troopers be like: \"Orbital strikes comming in? Neat. That lets me know where to run to to find the enemy.\"\n\nArtillery? You mean range finder?\n\nThis tickled my funny bone\n\nAlso for tying it to Kriegers;\n\nMaxims for Maximally Efficient Mercenaries rule 44: If it will blow a hole in the ground, it will double as an entrenching tool.\n\nRule 5 overrides rule 44.\n\nClose air support and friendly fire should be easier to tell apart.\n\n“Nah let’s leave our trenches and smoke the heretics out of theirs!”\n\nWe are guaranteed to have the element of surprise id we attack during our own artillery strike!\n\n[deleted]\n\n[deleted]\n\nFirst shelling in my game was incredibly helpful. After that pure WWI fear and terror with each bombardment.\n\nIt's such a wild feeling when a strike wipes out the base you were approaching and you have a moment of elation before the next shell lands right on top of you.\n\nI'm wearing the armor that gives you 50% chance to survive lethal damage. The shell lands and the armor kicks in but it flings me into a mine. Another time the shell landed on a hellbomb and blew me up.\n\nI played a few this morning and honestly it was kind of hilarious getting ragdolled all over the place. I dont think any of them ever killed me or even injured me much at least. It did add to the general chaos of the game, which is half the reason I play\n\nThe friendly fire kills allow the gunners to refine their initial 5 hours of training on the orbital platform systems.  Your deaths bring us incremental steps closer to victory over the ruthless bots and bugs and furthers the goal of protecting our glorious managed democracy.\n\nYeah, do you *not* want the most experienced, practiced gunners defending you?\n\n*DO YOU HATE DEMOCRACY?!*\n\nFrankly if you didnt hate democracy it obviously wouldnt have hit you, all its doing is weeding out future traitors\n\nTHEY CAN SEE YOUR MECHANICAL INCLINATIONS FROM SPACE \"\"\"HELLDIVERS\"\"\"\n\n\\*minutes\n\nFiring an orbital super weapon is expensive. The helldiver providing the targeting for the super weapon is disposable.\n\nMy life for Super Earth 🫡\n\nThey just need to add something that indicates where a missile is going to drop. They do it with the purple light when a meteor is about to hit I don’t see why they can’t do something similar.\n\nBut I still think the constant barrage is awesome.\n\nNo markers on impact point does change my opinion a bit\n\nYeah, the article neglected to mention that *very important part*\n\nI think it would be fine, and a mild annoyance at worst, if you just knew where to stand. \n\nI’m fairly certain it also functions like the traitor barrage, where it’s oriented around the player, rather than the enemies. I don’t think I’ve actually seen it hit an enemy yet, unless I decide to take a suicide mission\n\nYeah but then the poor ai who created this article would have to do more than just quote a bunch of people on reddit\n\n&gt;I don’t think I’ve actually seen it hit an enemy yet, unless I decide to take a suicide mission\n\n\"Now, some egghead says that *some* people are timid and *afraid of the enemy*. This won't do. Because of this, the tracker on your suit now doubles as a targeting beacon for our artillery. If the enemy is holding a fortified position, simply breach the position at best possible speed and our artillery will do the rest while you clear the blast zone. Dismissed!\"\n\nI've seen it kill a few bots. Mostly divers though. It's hilarious and I love it.\n\nI’ve seen it finish off a Factory Strider. \n\nI’m hearing speculation that when you see the message on screen, it means that now YOU are at the center of a 100m radius and usually the shots land near the edges of that.\n\nBut then the buggies will run away\n\nMuch like earth dogs, bugs can't look up.\n\nYou here that from Big Al?\n\n&gt; But then the buggies will run away\n\nSome of you may die, but that's a risk I'm willing to take!\n\nThematically it seems cooler without it. Like of course it massacres its own sides disposable grunts without care.\n\nThematically it's fun but just like the original \"use your stratagems, also here's a -1 stratagem modifier and 5x more heavy enemy spawns than stratagem uses you get, have fun dying instantly because helldivers are expendable\" balancing, they can get pretty unfun once the novelty wears off.\n\nI mean the thing is, they'll fix it and you can just dive other planets while that's happening.\n\nSometimes you do end up dropping on a planet that's WAY overtuned and it sucks, but yeah, just go somewhere else if it sucks. Or be amused by how completely ridiculous the game is all the time. Or just play on 7, it's never too bad on 7. I have never been in a fun squad that didn't think a wipe was hilarious FWIW.\n\nHelldivers will get old at some point I guess but if you are a casual sort of person that only games with friends a few hours a week... Still a lot of life left in it since release. If you want to game 5 hours a day 7 days a week I'm sure you would have burned out on it though and shit would just piss you off.\n\nFor me, what I want is some stat of how many enemies the DSS killed. I get the feeling that it isn't doing anything while it absolutely obliterates me, and I'd love evidence to the contrary.\n\nIts not even indiscriminately, the way it setup its far more deadly for Helldivers than for enemies\n\nI watched a shot obliterate a lone trooper standing in the middle of nowhere. It was amazing, like the person aiming from the DSS had a personal beef with the little guy.\n\n\"Try taking the last pudding in the mess hall again, asshole\".\n\n\"I warned you Dale! What did i say? The next time you eat my pudding, I am going to turn YOU into pudding!\" - Hungry DSS Weapons Operator\n\nAnd thats why Serviceman Chung, we do NOT eyeball it!\n\nConsidering the lore of the game I would be surprised if they even had sights for those weapons.\n\nThe thing has iron sights.\n\nEvery time this gun fires, its going to ruin _someone's_ day, _somewhere, sometime!_\n\nSir Isaac Newton is the deadliest son of a bitch in space!\n\nNO CREDIT FOR PARTIAL ANSWERS\n\nBiggest difference is even if its blasting enemies, the enemies can endlessly be respawned, something helldivers have a limited stock of.\n\nEdit: you know what would be an easy fix for this actually?  \nDSS kills don't deplete helldiver reinforcements.  \nIt'd still be annoying but at least it alleviates losing because of RNG entirely.\n\nLiberty is infinite soldier\n\nThat would be a pretty big buff, especially with a Hellpod efficiency booster. Never run out of ammo, grenades, or stims.\n\nIt would signal a theme of \"We are using significantly more resources to do this\", which seems like it should fit with \"We put a giant station of death in orbit around this planet\"\n\nalmost as if the results of democracy are not always predictable.\n\nLet's.... Let's just not today, ok?\n\nOn brand\n\nI’m not familiar with the game, is this on brand? Like the devs did it intentionally to troll and it aligns with the spirit of the game?\n\nIt's a satire on fascist military dictatorships in the same vein as starship troopers.\n\nHelldivers 1 was a twin stick shooter where your bullets would collide with your friends and your automated turrets didn't care about friendlies between them and the enemy (since it's essentially 2D the only way for a bullet to pass over someone instead of hitting them was for them to go prone). Before that Arrowhead made Magicka where you both hit any friendlies in your line of fire and your magic was incredibly capable of exploding yourself and others. Friendly fire is the core of their design philosophy.\n\nI don’t see how you can still be in the Helldiver community at this point and not have expected this to happen.\n\nFreedom is indiscriminate. It rains down on all, friend or foe\n\nMe thinks perhaps some people do not understand the concept of “planetary bombardment”\n\n[deleted]\n\nUsually you do the bombardment *before* deploying troops to a location.\n\nthat's just inefficient, if you do them at the same time the battle takes half as long. I can see you don't know much about being a general\n\nbasically what happens is that most shells will start falling in a roughly 80-100 m circle around the diver. however, another big chunk of the shells will also spray more inwards, sometimes just landing on top of your head. Also, if you advance too fast, you will get caught in that \"ring\" before it catches up to your new position, \n\nI really tried finding a pattern in it but could not find a way to make sure I don't get a shell on top of my head. Holding still will get you hit not much slower than keeping a walking pace.\n\nBut its not a planetary bombardment. Its a you bombardment. It would be cool if it bombards target areas but it follows you instead.\n\nPlanetary bombardment would include firing at keypoints on the planet including enemy occupied bases, not a random helldiver out in the middle of nowhere.  You don't just aimlessly fire at a planet you intend to inhabit in random locations like you're carpet bombing the whole thing.\n\nYou're not thinking this through. Good helldivers go towards the enemy, so if you shoot at them, you'll probably hit the enemy. And bad cowardly helldivers deserve to get bombarded, so it's a win win.\n\nClicked the article and saw it described as a death star. Are people really shocked theyre not surviving if a death start is targeting the planet theyre on?\n\nAnd people can just… choose to play a planet it’s not on. I personally love it. I get that lore doesn’t always trump bad gameplay, but the surprised pikachu faces going: “Wait, super Earth doesn’t care about our lives?” is somewhat funny to me.\n\nOn a more serious note, I see that adjustments to the mechanics need to be made if it wants to remain as a long-term feature.\n\nThe problem is that it's currently on a planet that we need to fight on to win the major order. If we go to other planets, we won't have the numbers to take it.\n\nTo be fair, this is exactly what would happen in the lore of the game.\n\nAnd it's exactly what *did* happen in the lore of the game!\n\nsounds like a lesson to be learned, like the whole experience is trying to tell/teach you something\n\nReminds me of\n\n&gt;Sci-Fi Author: In my book I invented the Torment Nexus as a cautionary tale  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Tech Company: At long last, we have created the Torment Nexus from classic sci-fi novel Don't Create The Torment Nexus\n\n[Source: Alex Blechman on Twitter](https://x.com/AlexBlechman/status/1457842724128833538)\n\nThe first time I saw an ad for Palantir on the walls of the Pentagon Metro stop I almost thought it was an elaborate satire--but no, it was a real product.\n\nLetterkenny-tobefair.gif.... the Palantir were perfectly great tools used to communicate over large distances for the benefit of elves/numinorians... They just got into the wrong hands...\n\nGiven the person behind today's Palantir IS the wrong hands...\n\nHaha--true! I was thinking about how every time we read about someone looking into a Palantir, one of the parties gets bamboozled. Even Sauron was tricked by Aragorn, and even when Peregrin looks in Sauron is just confused by what he sees.\n\nAnd boy oh boy, Peter Thiel is definitely not someone we want near anything potent. That's just bad news.\n\nFortunately it’s not like he totally owns the guy who will be the beat of one clogged, tweaking-on-meth heart away from the presidency in two months\n\nFrom the article, it looks like the weapon doesnt attack everything on the map randomly. Instead, it seems specifically focused on targeting player teams and having the bombardment happen near players...which barely kills any enemies. This is probably because the map areas are only active if there is a player nearby?\n\nThis is a poor design choice. The weapon should have kill indiscriminately across the entire map, or kill in a somewhat \"directed\" killzone with a huge blast radius/kill radius if they were trying to make a point.\n\nThe article isn't really accurate. For one thing they call it a \"350mm\" barrage, when they probably mean 380mm, but in-game it is more like the 120mm barrage except over a much larger range and slower firing rate.\n\nIt isn't literally just over the players. My team had enemy bases 150-200m away get hit. People are just exaggerating and whining because it isn't what they expected.\n\nSeriously, I ran a operation last night and while it can be frustrating at times, large outposts will be killed by themselves as long as you're in the general vicinity for a while. Chaotic fun, run personal/emplacement shields\n\n&gt; as long as you're in the general vicinity for a while\n\nThats sort of the issue. Its fire tornados all over again\n\nHelldivers *appears* to be a surface level parody of fascism, but it's actually an incredibly well thought out satire that has a bunch of deeper layers to exactly how it drags players into the fascist worldview before slapping them in the face with it.  I cannot wait to get destroyed by the military industrial complex I helped to fund.\n\nThere's a deeper meaning to this...\n\nsounds like treason citizen, I’ll have to report you to the nearest democracy officer at once\n\nAs an avid Helldiver, this development cracks me up.\n\nIt's basically traitor trigger but it's on 100% of the mission no matter what\n\npure comedy\n\nAnd now they gave us shield strategem for free 😂\n\nPersonally I thought accidental friendly fire was one of the best parts of the game. I always laughed when someone threw down a barrage and I didn’t notice and ran straight into it.\n\nIt's funny when it's an action that one of you actively took (tossing a strategem/grenade/whatever), doubly so if it's something they can see coming before it kills them. It's also generally a one-time thing. Reinforce, grab your stuff, and keep going.\n\nIt's not funny when you're just running to the next objective and get sniped by a random shell that's impossible to see coming. And the barrage never ends. You can die, get reinforced, grab your stuff, and immediately die again to the exact same thing.\n\nYeah, this exactly. It's fun when it's something you can trace to your own mistake, or a hilarious coincidence that doesn't happen often. But when it's happening constantly for the entire mission, and you have no control over it - that just isn't fun gameplay.\n\nMy group always plays at level 6 because it's hard enough you have to pay attention, but easy enough you can laugh when team kill accidents happen. We have a lot of fun.\n\n6 or 7 is the sweet spot and where my group usually hangs out, though the team-killing is a lot less \"accident\" and a lot more \"totally predictable consequence to our actions.\"\n\nTake the funniest joke you've ever heard\n\nRepeat it 100 times\n\nIt's probably not funny anymore\n\nAre any regular players shocked?\n\nThis is very much on the nose for the game.\n\nAs is the reaction\n\nThey have just put in some temporary changes to how it works due to, in their words, \"an unexpected steep increase in heroic sacrifices\" while they work out a longer term rework\n\n I love the metaphor of this so much, this is exactly what real world Superweapons like nukes do, they kill everything ultimately.\n\nI really wish this game would actually come to Xbox one day (I know it won’t) I can’t afford a new PC and that’s only going to become a more distant dream over the years so I’ll fight for democracy through all you.\n\nSounds kinda like if you bombard an area your military is, you might get casualties. What did they expect? What sense would a bombardment make if it laser focused on just an enemy?\n\nIt's a *bombardment*.\n\nYall forget the average lifespan of a helldiver in combat is literally 3 minutes\n\nOnly unlucky divers get killed by the bombardment; and to be unlucky is treasonous\n\nYeah no I’m not shocked at all. It fits the bill perfectly. \n\nThe fact that there hasn’t been a full scale mutiny in that game yet is surprising\n\nFeels on brand to me.\n\nThis sounds like the gaming equivalent of leopards ate my face.\n\nSo it's doing exactly what anyone who understands the game would expect it to do?\n\nHow can they be so into the game and completely ignorant of the messaging being satire of hyper nationalism and military industrial complex situations?"

I just happen to have a Tiny Violin Pro, new in box, if you're interested.....\n\nI have a entire stock for cheaper!\n\nDon't really want one, but I guess I'll take it if you'll come down to half price.\n\nCan you meet me by the tiny McDonald's on Small Street? I'll be there at 2:30 PM. I drive a Mini.\n\nI only meet at around 1am, you know, the small hours of the morning.\n\nHow much for the Mini?\n\nComes with horsehair bow and horseshit prices\n\nViolin strings sold separately\n\nWasn’t there a single post clamoring that it was selling well and that Reddit was an echo chamber 🤪\n\nFuck, the scalpers played both sides!\n\n[deleted]\n\nFor the price, I'm surprised they didn't include 6 or 12 months of Extra or Premium. I'm sure games look nicer, but most people are still fine with 1080p streaming even though 4k exists. I still think the base PS5 looks wonderful, even if I didn't own a PS5 I don't think I'd pay extra for the PS5 Pro.\n\n&gt;  I'm sure games look nicer, but most people are still fine with 1080p streaming even though 4k exists.\n\n...and because they're still making almost every game PS4 cross play, the Pro is mostly useless. Until they make games that are pushing the boundaries of what the PS5 can handle, like The Last of Us and Sleeping Dogs did with the PS3, no one needs to spend $1000 on a console that's a slight upgrade. None of the current games are really stressing the PS5 system...\n\n\"Oh, no. Anyway.\"\n\nThey better start buying tiny violins now\n\nGoddammit scalpers got to them did they?\n\nMaybe the scalpers should sell tiny violins instead?\n\nI'll sell you one. Strings sold separately of course.\n\nNo strings attached?\n\nIt's always nice to see a uplifting news article. \n\nr/MadeMeSmile\n\nI didn't know this was a thing. Thank you for posting it.\n\nHeads up, it's mostly dystopian horror like \"kid secretly saves allowance to help pay for mom's cancer treatment\"\n\nThat's r/OrphanCrushingMachine\n\nThe title of the current top post in r/MadeMeSmile :\n\n&gt;My mom has been struggling with a degenerative neurological issue for a few years, leaving her almost completely unable to use her hands. Today she was able to finish this weaving.\n\nI see no difference between the subs.\n\nThat doesn't seem like r/orphancrushingmachine to me\n\nYeah, OCM needs some kind of societal oppression or malfuction. Illnesses aren't (necesarily) man-made\n\nMore like r/OrphanMakingMachine in this instance, but the genre of the posts is the same: \"Look at this absolutely heartwarming ray of sunshine in the miserable life of this person caused by the horrid state of our country that would make you want to die if you thought about it for a minute. Doesn't that make you smile?\"\n\nIt's the majority of that sub's content\n\nJfc what is wrong with people, thanks for looking out!\n\n[deleted]\n\n&gt; The author is mistaking plentiful production (undercutting scalpers) for \"a lack of interest\" in PS5 Pro.\n\nYeah exactly this. \n\nSmart scalpers understand supply and demand and the inherent market inefficiencies and potential PR issues that big companies have when pricing a product to swoop in and resale at it's \"true\" market value in a shortage.\n\nDumb scalpers think they can just buy up and resell anything for a profit, not understanding that plentiful supply means no one is gonna pay over the better offer available.\n\nIt's a completely fabricated story....\n\nScalpers would simply return the console if they can't sell it. There is absolutely no reason for them to sell at a loss.\n\n&gt;\n\nStuff like this is also funny \"You can get a PS5 Pro for significantly cheaper if you go through an auction\" then in the same paragraph they admit that it's not true because obviously the price of an auction with a week left isn't the final price\n\nGood luck finding a retailer that'll let you return 100 PS5 pros for no reason\n\nGood luck finding a retailer who sold 100 PS5 pros to one person.\n\n[deleted]\n\n&gt;People love an uplifting story, even when the story is garbage.\n\nFeels like the entire United States just had a big deal on swallowing horseshit when it echoes what they want to hear.\n\nAnd they call reddit \"the echochambers of all echochambers\". All I gotta do is roll over to the conservative subs and its just mind boggling propganda non-stop.\n\nThe console also has only been out for 3 days. Who the fuck starts selling at a loss that quickly?\n\nProduction is only going to ramp up going into the holidays. If there isn't enough demand at launch to outstrip retail supply, then there won't be. They sell them now at a loss rather than sit on them and sell them for possible a bigger loss later.\n\nThe real questions is why they can't just return them.\n\nIt would depend on the returns policy, if they original seller would be willing to restock without fee, purchaser (consumer or business), jurisdiction, quantity, if it can be done as a consumer as opposed to a business.\n\nPretty sure if I tried to buy 100 of something as a consumer, most times I could get away with it. But if I tried to open 100 identical returns, depending on the retailer then that's going to raise eyebrows and it'll get flagged as commercial (and thus not subject to the free returns policy) or potential fraud. I'd then have to fight to try and get my returns accepted without fees.\n\n15% restocking fee\n14 day return policy\n\njust posted it there\n\nFuck those scalpers\n\nWhen I worked at Best Buy, there was this one scalper who ordered 20 or so Xbox One consoles on different cards all at once, and our system wasn't smart enough to catch that the order was all put in by one guy because of that. Whoever processed the store pickup didn't cancel it for some reason, even though most stores did if they noticed the same customer on an item with limited availability.\n\nWhat the guy hadn't realized is that the entire company had received oodles of consoles and they were no longer on back-order, and for the most part, they were never going to be on back-order again. He tried to return them after failing to sell them and an awesome manager basically said lol no.\n\nAfter dealing with rude scalpers for months, it was great to see the tides turned.\n\nWhat was the rationale given for saying no?\n\nI could see them saying that the scalper maliciously broke the store policy by purchasing more systems than were for personal use, so they can’t benefit from the store policy that allows returns. If the scalper disagrees, they can seek a remedy from a Court.\n\nThis sounds pretty accurate. When you purchase anything you're making a type of legally binding contract. A store's return policy is part of that contract, but the customer broke the terms of their agreement by not following the 1 per customer limitation that the store put in the agreement. So because they broke that rule, the longer benefits of the contract are null. The store has already been monetarily compensated, but they no longer have to hold up the rest of their obligations to that customer. Hence, no return policy.\n\nI really hope they stay from  the Nintendo switch 2.\n\nWhether they do or don't, just don't buy them.\n\nYou can wait. If you buy anything from a scalper, then you have no right to whine because you are the problem.\n\nI waited years for a ps5. So long that I didn't even want it when it was finally on shelves in retail.\n\n&gt;I waited years for a ps5. So long that I didn’t even want it when it was finally on shelves in retail.\n\nSo the common wisdom to “sleep on it” before making a big purchase to make sure you actually want it is instead (for video game consoles) “sleep on it for a few years”?\n\ni mean, yah i guess? I got a used PS5 last year for $330. Purchased about five games. It's still a nice console, but i mostly use it for streaming.\n\nThis happened to me for Xbox Series X. Was 12+ months after launch before they started appearing on shelves and by then I didn't want one.\n\nI just stayed with my Xbox one. Only moved int a series S once 1/3 of my friends had gone next gen\n\nYep same\n\nEnded up buying a PC with the money i had saved for the Xbox\n\nYeah I remember waiting about a year or so. Then one day I ran into an electronics place by me to buy a phone charger and they had a stack of them. Was like oh shit I guess todays the day lol\n\nPeople acting like covid is going to cause a chipshortage again.... or forgot covid existed.\n\nAI is causing the shortage instead.\n\nI don't understand why people don't wait a bit. I got my switch about a year after they came out and I didn't miss out on anything. The only thing I missed out on was crazy people paying double or triple the price.\n\nScarcity is one of the oldest sales tricks in the book. We've all fallen for it at some point.\n\nI did that. Decided to wait for PS5 on principle even though I could've afforded to buy it from a scalper. Took some time and luck but I'm happier for it.\n\nNo problem for me. I'll gladly wait 1, 2, 3, or even 4 years for a switch. If it means they are collecting dust in a scalper's warehouse burning rent money, I'm happy\n\nHave bad news for you then...\n\nIn all fairness, a lot of the PS5 supply issues were mainly down to Covid shutting everything down.\n\nPlus a larger than expected demand from people noq stuck at home with nothing to do.\n\nThey're gonna be all over it like no tomorrow. Good luck.\n\nThe margin will be better smuggling them across the Canadian border to evade tariffs.\n\nnonono!..see, tariffs are paid by the other countries and actually make goods much cheaper for citizens!\n\n-source: every trump voter ever.\n\nJust go to a store the day the preorder is announced and pay for it then. \n\nGoing in store for a preorder gives you a much higher chance of getting the thing then doing it online, and then you're good for whenever it comes out\n\nI'm sure they will if you ask nicely\n\n[deleted]\n\nWould be kind of sick if Sony just dropped the price. Managing to tax the whales and scalpers in one move just to actually sell at a real price.\n\nYeah just lower the price, surely that will help the scalper issue and not make it worse instantly.\n\nGood. Get fucked, scalpers.\n\n[removed]\n\nI’ll never forget the lady who brought her three kids with her to Walmart, just so she could buy the last four RIGHT in front of me.\n\nI remember. It's so scummy. This world is becoming a terrible place filled with terrible people, and it's nice to see some of them get their comeuppance.\n\nIn my country, they're even doing this with driving tests now.\n\nScalpers are parasites seemingly everywhere.\n\nHey Scalpers, I'll take one for free otherwise no deal.\n\nya, i don't want one either but if it's free i guess i can think about it a bit\n\nBest I can do is $3.50.\n\nfound the loch ness monster!\n\nIt makes no logical sense to scalp a PS5 Pro. The demand was not there and the online discourse was extremely negative. PS5 Pro is a luxury item and people who can afford it got it. It's like, the writing was already on the wall. Whoever tried to scalp PS5 Pro's are idiots.\n\nYeah the smart scalpers bought all the seperate disc drives and now there are none on the market knowing these rich kids want a disc drive for their new PS5 Pro so their parents are willing to pay more.\n\n&gt; Yeah the smart scalpers bought all the seperate disc drives\n\nGameStop has had them in stock lol. I ordered one when my Pro shipped and it came on the same day as the Pro. Just checked and they’re still in stock online and the local brick and mortar locations have it too. Idk what kind of amateur hour operation these scalpers are running because average normie rich kid would check this kind of shit.\n\nBloomberg claimed there was a 2-month wait for an nVidia graphics card on the day I bought mine from the nVidia website.\n\nIn the EU, stock is a lot more limited. And legit stores started raising the prices as well not long after the PS5 Pro was announced not to come with a drive. They used to sell for €130 (which was still a lot) and now they cost €160+ in a lot of places if you can find them in stock.\n\nI looked into this today, and they're only available for delivery if you have Gamestop Pro, and no stores near me have them in stock.\n\nYup.\n\nStill find it hilarious that the “pro” version of the console needs a separate disk drive. Shouldn’t the pro be the definitive edition?\n\nAnd the difference just depends if you care about graphics that much. Sure, it's impressive, but I've been playing games on performance mode for so long I don't care much about graphics now. We're a bit far in for that.\n\nNormal PS5's still play the same.\n\nWould I like things to look nicer? Sure... but unless my PS5 craps out on me or it's a PS6 (lol) I don't need to upgrade.\n\nmost of the games I have played on ps5 are ps4 games I really don't care for the extra ray tracing or whatever it does.\n\n100% this!\n\nMy PS4 is still chugging along and I am still playing great games on it. I want to play Baldur's Gate 3 but until there is another PS5 only game I won't be buying a PS5.\n\nI bought a ps5 pro because I don't have a ps5 yet and given how every game for 5 years was a ps4/ps5 game I'd rather have the pro for when there's 5 years of ps5/ps6 games so it can run decently.\n\nMaybe in 5 years it will crack 15 exclusives.\n\nAnd still won’t have a remaster of bloodborn.\n\n…or a 60fps patch\n\nBlooodborne will come aftet the ps6 remaster of hzd and last of us /s.\n\nI know too many people freaking out over the new PS5 with 60hz non-OLED TVs.\n\nConvinced it's just people infected with end-stage FOMO.\n\nIf my PS5 craps out on me with how little I use it (PC mainly) the hell would I reward Sony for it's failure?\n\n“the online discourse was extremely negative”\n\nOnline discourse for anything is extremely negative. There is always a subset of the market willing to pay more for the latest thing.\n\nReddit is going to Reddit and forget how disconnected they are from the real world.  Last month the PS Pro was a complete failure and Kamala Harris was going to win the presidency by a landslide if Reddit is your only news source. Last year Reddit decided the playstation portal was a failure too and it's made Sony a fortune.\n\nYou could’ve ignored all the discourse, all the whining, everything online.    \n   \nIf you held onto pre orders of the Pro and never realized that not a single retailer was sold out of pre orders, every single place online had pre orders available, etc and you didn’t cancel those orders the day before…they’re just fucking idiots.    \n    \nEven the ones who can simply return them are losing out on gas money, time, etc so even then they’re losing money.\n\nOnly a true genius thinks they will make money scalping a product that never went out of stock. \n\nI bet they saw the hustle and money the scalpers made during covid with the ps5 shortages, so they figured they'd do the same thing with the pro version, but there's no shortages like back with covid and as you said, the ps5 pro is a luxury item. Most people who wanted a ps5 already got a ps5. I mean the ps5 got released 4 years ago and it only has 22 exclusives (including games that are to be released) which includes : 4 VR games, 3 remakes, 1 remaster, 2 small demo-like games, that's nearly half the PS5's catalogue of exclusives.\n\nLike there is not a single reason i can think of why anyone would buy a scalped overpriced PS5 pro\n\nThey tried scalping GPUs which only did well at first then quickly a ton of people just didn't because the people that wanted it already had it.\n\nJesse Cox said this is his feel good story of the week. Totally agree. Because it's been a rough week.\n\nThis, plus I found out POS co-worker was given a termination letter (f’ing finally!)…makes me hopeful for the near future at least\n\nJesse Cox is such a stellar lad, my brother and I have followed him for over a decade at this point\n\nGonna be a rough 4 years, at least\n\nFuck Scalpers. All my homies hate them.\n\nIts not “lack of interest” it is “sufficient supply”.\n\nHoly shit, let’s not motivate companies even more to keep supply low so they can brag about demand.\n\nExcuse me, sufficient supply does not fit the Reddit echo chamber.\n\nCovid was the wet dream of Playstation cos everyone wanted one and they were able to even push up the price instead of lowering it after launch. They were so behind in supplying every single hardware flew off the shelf thanks to scalpers.\n\nNow that there’s a ps5 pro being prepped for release, demand is decreasing a little but Sony has sold 65 mil ps5s so far, about what the ps4 sold about the same time after launch. Supply has finally caught up with demand though so the scalpers cashing in on the covid supply chain problems aren’t able to get the same money.\n\nIt’s almost like PlayStation learned from launch of the PS5 and the shortages that caused bottlenecks and trying to rush to the market didn’t happen this time so there was a decent supply at time of launch.\n\n“Enough availability is forcing scalpers to sell them for a loss”. Fixed.\n\nI wonder if this is the way for me to get a cheaper one 😂\n\n“Look at me. I am the scalper now.”\n\nWhat an awfully written article\n\nSo is there no interest or are they outselling the PS4 pro? I’ve seen both\n\nThis news really isn't mutually exclusive with the PS5 Pro outselling the PS4 Pro. Scalping is failing because retailers have enough consoles to meet demand, which could also just be a consequence of Sony making more consoles before going into launch.\n\nYeah shit ain't Covid times.\n\nWhen I preordered mine on Amazon I was going to get one for me and one for my daughter but it only allowed 1 per customer so I got her a slim.\n\nOr what's going on is that Sony made enough units to cover demand.\n\nIt's just that COVID and the chip shortage meant there's been an expectation creates that things need to be Out of Stock to be a success in any way.\n\n\nBut really this is the normal way of things. That you can buy the New Product.\n\nIt's not a lack of interest so much that it's that there is enough consoles being sold that people can just go to the store and get one. \n\nIt's kinda funny how peoples expectations for new things nowadays is that they should be sold out or they are a failure.\n\nIt’s not lack of interest, it’s Sony being able to produce a normal amount. \n\nCovid isn’t causing shortages anymore\n\nGood.\n\nThis article is so fucking stupid.\n\nFirstly, it's an \"article\" about another article.\n\nSecondly, there are only a few auctions with bids less than MSRP. The \"article\" literally says most scalpers still have them listed well above MSRP while they have only found a handful of consoles for less than MSRP. \n\nGag me with a spoon.\n\nFun fact: PS5 Pro costs about the same as PS1 did back in the day.\n\nThe headlines says it's low demand but the article says it's because it is readily available online \n\nThose aren't the same thing\n\nYeah, Amazon will get me one by tomorrow. Why go to a scalper?\n\nExactly.  I don't know how well it's selling but Sony says they have no supply constraints.  Scalping only works when there is more demand than supply.  Sony can supply tons.\n\nIt’s ironic how scalpers thought they could cash in on a mid-gen upgrade that barely moves the needle for most gamers. With decent availability, they’re just stuck holding overpriced bricks. Maybe next time they’ll read the room before betting on a product that no one really asked for.\n\nIs it a lack of interest, or was Sony ready with a proper supply this time?  The 30th pro sold out instantly and is very scalpable due to limited numbers.  \n\nThis headline just feels inflammatory in favor of \"no one wants a pro\" despite them selling decently, according to Sony.\n\nThis. It seems that since the pandemic, any piece of hardware that doesn’t sell out instantly and is impossible to get a hold of for months on end is a failure. And if they do sell out, the companies are berated for not upping their production or accused of generating artificial scarcity. There’s no winning against the chronic complainers.\n\nIt seems as though this is the case with everything: games, movies, tech, cars. If something isn't breaking some sort of record, it's a flop. I think it's due to content creators/media wanting to get clicks. \"Product sells as expected\" won't get as many views as \"Experts  got it wrong! Find out why &lt;insert product here&gt; is failing to meet expectations.\"\n\nIt’s this, and that’s why the “reddit is an echo chamber” narrative continues to get stronger. They’re selling like hot cakes, despite the Reddit consensus being that nobody would want one. The reason scalpers can’t get rid of theirs is the sufficient supply, so no one has to look on the secondary market to find one. Scalpers are only selling at a loss because no one is gonna buy a retail-priced console from an individual seller when they can get one from any electronics retailer with all the protections that purchase comes with; returns, warranties, etc. \n\nDon’t get me wrong, fuck the scalpers and they deserve it, but them not being able to sell theirs =/= a lack of consumer interest.\n\nFuck every dirty scalper. They all deserve to get fucked.\n\nBut why\n\n\nThey could return them for a refund, this doesn't make sense\n\nThey should have read the room.  Most people were not excited about this, especially given the price tag.\n\nSo busy trying to scam the room I didn't read the room.\n\nSeems like the console is selling well enough for Sony, but they were able to get a plentiful amount of stock out there. Hopefully this can happen with a few more tech releases so more scalpers can eat shit and stop doing this nonsense.\n\nIts not lack of interest its more that its readily available compared to PS5\n\nWhy a loss? I mean usually you can get a full refund on opened ps5\n\nMost stores won't accept a mass refund on items that have a high return rate or are very expensive. These aren't regular customers that are trying to return a single PS5.\n\n[deleted]\n\nThis was my feeling on the article too, felt like pandering or trying too hard to create a narrative.\nI find it hard to believe that scalpers were targeting the PS5 Pro.  I hate scalpers as much as the general populace here on reddit but lets not fall victim to sensationalism.\n\nScalpers are just returning them, obviously. They’re not selling at a loss.\n\nPretty sure someone pointed out this is likely false since they are all still within the return window\n\nWhat a misleading headline, the reason the scalpers are selling at a lost has nothing to do with \"lack of Interest\" and everything to do with an elastic supply chain/plenty of stock. \n\nWhy would anyone buy a ps5 pro of some dodgy guy of Facebook for an inflated price, when they can go to any retailer and buy a unit on their credit card with full warranty.\n\nI'm guessing some less-informed scalpers got caught which fed this feelgood headline. Meanwhile, the smart scalpers are making bank off PS5 drives and R7 9800X3D.\n\nTight, where can I get one of these so called discounted scalper ps5 pros then?\n\nI don't think it's a lack of interest, it's selling more than the PS4 pro did in the same time frame. It's just that Sony have provided enough stock for a change\n\nbrave childlike disarm melodic quaint poor enter party public tub\n\nThis articles are so stupid. Scalpers will just return the console before they sell it at a loss\n\nThey could just return them, no?\n\nit hasn’t been out that long.\n\nScalpers are probably the reason Sony announced that the PS5 Pro price tag wasn't affecting sales. Extra fuck 'em.\n\nlack of interest ? maybe they have plenty avaible from sony. there is no chip shortage. no doubt they are not selling like regular ps5s but lack of interest is a reach. the scalpers can get fupped.\n\nis this really news? i read the article and it didnt even say how many people are selling their console for a loss or how many over priced mark ups they found. the writer might have found 2 pro's being sold for $1000 each and 1 going for $560 and made the article about it.\n\nOr, you know, their supply is meeting demand so people don’t need to buy them for inflated prices.\n\nLack of interest, or high retail price and generally good supply?\n\nCouldn’t they just I dunno, return them?\n\nEvery other day the headline is either the ps5 pro isn’t selling well or it’s the ps5 pro is outselling everything before it? Bro\n\nCrazy. \nDisc drive scalping in Europe is out of control. 250 bucks for a disc drive is what they are asking for.... Insanity. \nPeople are returning their consoles to Sony since they can't use them properly without a disc drive.\n\nIt’s actually selling quite well. Better than the ps4 pro. Sony just made plenty of them so no shortage to exploit. Fuck scalpers.\n\nHere, let me play the world's smallest violin \n\nI hope it financially ruins them\n\nScalping should be illegal, fuck people who defend it. It has no place in society\n\nCost of living crisis with inflation is probably not a good time to release an expensive console.\n\nThe only way the ps5 pro is a good choice is if you get it discounted and if you don't already have a ps5\n\nScalpers aren’t the brightest people.\n\nSuch trash click bait. It's not \"lack of interest\". Sony simply has enough stock, so that you can get it for the actual retail price instead of overpaying some dumbass scalper. We don't know sales numbers. Maybe they aren't selling well, maybe they're selling like gangbusters. There's no chip shortages this time around limiting stock.\n\nCan't they just return them ? Lol\n\nSell at a loss? Couldn’t they just return it?\n\nGood. So I will wait until early next year before getting one to replace my PS4.\n\nI doubt it's a lack of interest. I feel it's more likely that Sony has simply been able to keep a steady supply of PS5 pros. It's not going to sell as fast as the PS5s did at launch. It's a half-gen upgrade. And an expensive one at that. They're not going to fly off the shelves, but I don't think Sony really expected them to.\n\nI just checked the Best Buy website and saw that they have them in stock as I write this comment. With that in mind, why would anyone buy from a scalper instead of an actual store?\n\nIncorrect\n\nPS5 Pro has outsold the PS4 Pro, which had the advantage of 4K output for the market's new 4K TVs\n\nThe Pro machines of the last generation were outsold eight or nine out of 10 by the base models, this is expected to be the same for this generation, cuz the pro machines are only of niche interests for niche needs \n\nThankfully, this time, unlike the PS5 launch, Sony don't have the same supply or labour issues that dog the PS5 launch, and they've planned for supply to satisfy demand, unlike the disc drives which are only available from scalpers at huge markup\n\nAnd without warranty, let's not buy from them\n\nLike below suggested retail price? That is a win for consumers?\n\nI was able to buy mine easily at target 😄 it was such a nice feeling to get it instantly. Can’t wait for Monster Hunter!\n\nExactly why ps4 games are still being made lol\n\nlol people around me on marketplace have them listed for $900-1000 when they’re in stock on playstations site for $700\n\nI bought a PS5 ... and all I play is Rocket League ... perhaps I'm finally outgrowing video games.\n\nDid the scalpers really thought people would rush for a ps5 pro? They really cant read the room cant they lmao\n\nAfter what they did to the PS5 launch I have no pity, let them get burned.\n\nAll I'm hearing is ps5 pros on sale already.\n\nImagine Sony planned it all along, copium\n\nWouldn’t it make more sense to just return them it hasn’t even been out a week yet\n\nBased on what Sony has said about demand, I think more likely that they actually met the demand for launch in terms of producing units.\n\nSeeing greedy people get fucked over will never not put a smile on my face.\n\nYou just love to see it, not this time fuckers.\n\nI’m in no rush to upgrade (if I ever even do). The only reason I wanted the ps5 was because of the decreased load time and COVID. I didn’t buy a scalped one; I just followed the restocks to get one. I will never spend even that much effort again let alone the price tag\n\nPS5 Pro. But we made the disc drive and the vertical stand DLC\n\nWhy anyone would game on anything but a PC is beyond me. I used to have every console and a PC and one day realized, consoles fucking suck now. It was different back in the 80s and 90s. Eventually PC took over, and consoles steadily got shittier.\n\nthe world is healing"

PalPyramids. You’re welcome.\n\nThis is literally what Nexomon did in their games.\n\nThey even made a joke about it in the newest game when they mention Pyramids being a really annoying shape to throw and that balls would be better before your sidekick cuts you off mid sentence to not get you in trouble.\n\n&gt;Really annoying shape to throw \n\nWe need guns with Pal capturing bullets\n\nHow American of you.\n\nLook at all the Pals I caught with my PP!\n\nPP is in Pokemon too tho. Need something else.\n\nNintendo copyright my PP 😢\n\nI'm actually shocked they waited that long\n\nIts because it isn't due to trademarks or likeness according to the press release, but due to patent infringements.\n\nI thought you couldn't copyright a genre. Nintendo can't claim they own the monster catcher genre...\n\nThis isn't copyright, it's patent. This press release doesn't say which patents specifically.\n\nIt's uncommon, but game mechanisms have been patented in the past, like loading screen minigames, the Shadow of Mordor nemesis system, or even the idea of 'tapping' a card in Magic The Gathering.\n\nSega patented the arrow pointing to your destination in Crazy Taxi and sued Simpsons ~~Hit &amp; Run~~ Road Rage over it. I mean the game was a clone otherwise but still. They patented an arrow pointing to a destination.\n\nEdit: As others have pointed out, this was Simpsons Road Rage rather than Hit &amp; Run. My mistake.\n\nAnd just because you can patent something, doesn't mean the patent will hold up later in a court case. There's many many examples of patents getting thrown out once under scrutiny in court.\n\nSure, except Sega won theirs, and you have to be sure you can throw money at them until you win, because they absolutely can and will throw money at you until you lose or give up.  If you're not *certain* you can, and that it will be worth the fight, that's a huge disincentive to even test it.\n\nLike Terrence Howard’s 97 patents\n\nAll 0 of his patents\n\nI believe BioWare has also patented the dialogue wheel.\n\nForgot about that. That’s pretty low and I’m fine with saying that despite my love for the Mass Effect trilogy.\n\nWould've loved to see the nemesis system in other games, just another reason WB sucks.\n\nor loading screen minigames, wtf. I always wondered why that wasn't more popular\n\nIt expired in 2015 I wish people would give you something to fidget with. If probably get caught up and get annoyed at it ending though.\n\nSince things load off SSD instead of disc these days loading screens aren't long enough for mini games. They aren't even usually long enough for tips anymore.\n\nThat is why that pattent SUCKED. Never used in anything and nobody else could do it while it was still relevant. Bs\n\nConversely that is why the patent holders let it expire. It had no economic value left.\n\nThe irony is I still play Budokai 3 at times, and even on an emulator the loading screens are too short to even use them lol, modern hardware is too stronk.\n\nDevs have also gotten really good at hiding loading screens behind other gameplay activity\n\nCyberpunk elevators and god of war caves haha\n\nYep,  watching your character squeeze through a thin gap hasn’t been overused at all.\n\nI haven't seen a loading of more than 5-6 seconds in years, when I even see one. I feel like these days the efforts are put on making the loadings shorter instead of more entertaining.\n\nYeah, it would have been relevant when there was minute or longer loading screens. Loading screens are incredibly short nowadays, and sometimes the loading screen is hidden behind some sort of game traversal (like squeezing through a crack in the wall”.\n\nAhh yes, the notorious patent that finally expired when loading screens became obselete.\n\nI would love to play a Star Wars bounty hunter game with the nemesis system\n\nStar wars, super hero games,  medieval kingdom era warfare, etc. Etc.  \n  \nSo many uses. It was a great and fun system.\n\nIt was SO good. Sucks it essentially got shelved and likely won't see the light of day.\n\nOr sanity effects from Eternal Darkness.\n\nThey patented that??? That freaked me the hell out the first time my tv went crazy and the volume automatically started going to zero.\n\nI would sell my kidney for a new Eternal Darkness for this generation.\n\nI would even take a modern remaster of the original. I love that game so much.\n\nGame mechanic patents are absolute horseshit\n\nIt isn’t uncommon at all.\n\nAnd they don't. There are plenty of other Mons games out there.\n\nAgain, it is related to patents, not copyright. You can patent certain game mechanics and game mechanisms.\n\nThey needed to build a case. Get lots of documentation of the issues and work out the best way to attack it legally. They want to win, and they have a pretty decent track record of doing that.\n\n[deleted]\n\nDoing this intentionally hurts your case tho, youre supposed to sue as soon as you discover the infringement. Although, using the idea \"we were building a case/waiting for proper evidence\" would probably suffice\n\nI honestly don’t think they really care about money considering who they typically sue. Modders, or pirates or people who develop emulators or maintain shady websites are usually just normal people. Most of which have so little money their endeavours only survive on handouts. It’s much more likely what I said. They needed to make sure that when they attack Pocketpair, it hits with the maximum force they can muster. So that when the dust settles, Palworld won’t exist anymore.\n\nNintendo put Gary Bowser into $14 million of debt for just a lil piracy. The money sends the message.\n\nYep, because as litigious as Nintendo is, the point is almost always to protect their IP. Not to settle or find a middle ground, but to burn an area around their properties so large nothing can even approach it without being spotted and dealt with. And I honestly understand because unlike Xbox or PlayStation who really survive on the reputation of their hardware, Nintendo’s existence is almost entirely maintained by the love of their software. People buy a switch because they want to play Mario or Zelda. People buy a PlayStation because they can play anything else.\n\nSince it’s about patents, they probably were doing due diligence in figuring out what patents were violated, so they could have a solid case. This isn’t a copyright issue, so they’re not going after designs. \n\nIt’s probably not the monster catching mechanics, as many other games do that. It’s probably something more niche, that may not stick out at first. Some gameplay element violates some patent, likely.\n\nIt’s not about the creatures, it’s something about the game itself. But Nintendo is likely going this route to punish them, as they probably didn’t have enough standing on copyright grounds.\n\nDefinitely mashing A and B buttons to make sure you catch the monster.\n\nYeah. Not suing based on copyright could just have been \"this way is easier to prove than copyright so why bother\"\n\nOr maybe a copyright suit is in the works too\n\nI’m shocked they actually did it. \n\nI figured given how long it’s been surely they dropped the possibility, but wow they’re actually going through with it.\n\nThey waited for the hype to die down, that’s the cynical reality.\n\nIf they had announced this back when everyone was playing and loving it, the backlash would be a lot harsher.\n\nEveryone here is acting as if Nintendo is not a near centenarian company at this point. It knows what its doing. It doesn't even needed to win a case to \"win\".\n\n[deleted]\n\nI mean, from a certain perspective 125 years could still be close to 100\n\nNintendo was no doubt exploring their options.  They might be super litigious but they aren't stupid and won't pick a fight they won't win.  They've probably had their lawyers looking into ways they could go after Pal World and only now confirmed they'd be able to make a case under patent law.\n\n&gt;They might be super litigious but they aren't stupid and won't pick a fight they won't win.\n\n[not always true](https://youtu.be/J3xuy5YALl0?si=psEIb1sm3IMfbT7Q).\n\nThey also attempted to sue and lost against a porn company. Nintendo owns the distribution rights to Super Hornio Bros 1 and 2 because it was cheaper and easier to just buy it out than attempt to deal with it in court after that.\n\nThat’s fucking hilarious\n\nAlso shows just how petty they can be.\n\nmountainous makeshift grab amusing pen squeal dazzling overconfident sable squash\n\nI'm curious what Patents Nintendo own for in-game mechanics because I haven't heard about any and companies that Patent in-game mechanics usually get absolutely draped over hot coals for doing so.\n\nDynasty Warriors and Shadow of Mordor both got major heat when their companies patented in-game mechanics and Im sure we would have heard if Nintendo (especially Pokemon) had done similar?\n\nPocketpair/Sony signed up to branch out into other avenues (like TCGs and stuff), maybe thats what they fell foul of, rather than the actual Palworld game.\n\nNintendo don't own catching mechanics, even when including the Pokeball method of delivery.\nOther games (like Nexomon) use a similar mechanic and have never been sued, this just seems weird from Nintendo.\n\nA *patent* lawsuit? Now I want to see the documents for this, because I've never even seen suggestions from anyone that Nintendo had any sort of grounds for such a suit.\n\nIf I had to guess what it could be about, it might be the catching mechanics in Palworld that are super similar to those in Legends: Arceus. Could also be simply the act of catching creatures in a ball. Either of those could be patented.\n\nNext update: Introducing the Pal Cube!\n\nFollowed by a Nintendo lawsuit for patent infringement on the Gamecube\n\nShit, how about Palbox One Series X?\n\nPalworld gets bought out by Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft immediately shutters the studio\n\nPhil Spencer releases yet another relatable, heartfelt video about having to make tough choices.\n\nAs if Microsoft could ever make such a simple name.\n\nIt would be Palbox One Scorpio Edition Series X 2 Platinum.\n\nThey would eventually come out with a sequel which consists of that exact series of words but in a different order.\n\nSo that’s how World of Final Fantasy stayed away from Nintendo’s wrath!\n\nBecause they used a cube! No one tell Nintendo men have balls with small creatures inside or else we’re in for it!\n\nHonestly, most monster catching games use something else than a ball.\n\nYokai Watch has coins, Nexomon has triangle things, etc.\n\nMy first thoughts also went to the pal sphere. Most other mechanics in palworld are industry staples by now, but the not-a-pokeball does seem a bit on the nose.\n\nThere's no patent to do with pokeball that I can see.\n\nThey patented the Pokeball Plus which is their accessory for Pokemon Go iirc?\n\nThey have a copyright for Pokeball but no patent for the in-game mechanics I'd assume.\n\nWhere would you be able to see their Japanese patents?\n\nMake them football shaped I guess, and you'd throw them like Brady\n\nThat...sounds unironically cool, bizarrely enough\n\nArk survival evolved has similar things to pokeballs for capturing, storing and releasing creatures\n\nHell, World of Warcraft has a pet battle system, where you need to weaken wild animals and throw cages at them to try and 'capture' them. Can then release them, put them in storage, or train them up to battle other animals.\n\nHas to be something else me thinks\n\nPatenting a gameplay mechanic is terrible for the entire game industry, because it limits on what games can use in their game design. It is because of this we don't see secondary games in loading screens (Namco patent for Ridge Racer); the pointing arrow navegation system (Sega patent for Crazy Taxi, this is why games go for the GTA mini map approach); or the nemesis system from Shadow of Mordor.\n\nYou can tell Nintendo is just being petty because they never sued any of the countless Pokémon clones made in the late 90's and early 2000's, many of which feature the same gameplay mechanics and even art style. But because Palworld grew to become a popular IP, they will strike.\n\nMini games in loading screens was patented, and we all suffered for years for it.\n\nIt was patented but not valid as those were already existing in the MS-DOS era\n\nPatenting pieces of artwork is such a terrible thing for the society. And yes, I consider video games art.\n\nImagine if Michelangelo patented the concept of a naked dude with his tiny wiener out. We'd be sued by his estate every time we tried to send a dick pic.\n\nWe are talking about the same company that patented the D-pad. This is why every Non-Nintendo game console used a different design for their D-pad (Sega's circular shape; Playstation separated four button D-pad; Xbox's weird D-pads over the years). Nintendo would patent the Jump Button if they could.\n\nThe D Pad patent covered the physical mechanism. That's infinitely more defendable than software patents.\n\nI’d imagine a patent for catching creatures in a ball is either expired or it was filed long after the original Pokémon. Patents - in the US - last about 20 years, IIRC.\n\nBut unfortunately, broader ideas for software systems can be patented, in a way that I think they really should not be. It used to be if you wanted a patent for something like, say, a duck-call for hunting, you had to have a real design for one, and only that design was patented and someone could improve upon your idea and get their own patent for it. Ideas for software systems are so much more abstract, the patent rights they grant are too broad and stifle innovation.\n\nHere's an example current gameplay patent owned by the Pokemon Company: [https://patents.google.com/patent/US11433303B2/](https://patents.google.com/patent/US11433303B2/)\n\n  \nYou can see other patents an applications assigned to them by clicking on THE POKEMON COMPANY under application events.\n\nThe thing that proves your point the best is the nemesis system from shadow of mordor. The fact that other devs cant improve or create their own system that is similiar is ridiculous.\n\nI didn’t realize you could patent stuff like that.  That’s a shame.\n\nIt's disgusting is what it is. Hitting the gas pedal on cyberpunk dystopia.\n\nI'm going to patent cyberpunk dystopias and sue anyone who moves us closer to it for infringement.\n\nSoftware patents are BS.\n\nPretty much the case whenever patents get brought up. Shit needs reform.\n\nSoftware patents are and always have been complete and utter bullshit.\n\nActually, the patent I can find is around the losing items when you are defeated and the being able to retreive them.\n\n&gt;An example of a server receives first event data from an information processing apparatus. The server stores therein event management data, including event state information that indicates whether a second event has already occurred or has not yet occurred. When receiving a request from the information processing apparatus, the server transmits at least one piece of second event data to the information processing apparatus. The at least one piece of second event data includes second event data based on event management data in which the event state information indicates that the second event has already occurred and/or second event data to be transmitted when the second event data stored in the first storage area is insufficient. Upon receiving the third event data indicating that the second event has occurred, the server updates the event state information so as to indicate that the second event has already occurred.\n\nPlayer A is defeated and loses item (loss event)\nPlayer B finds lost item ( pick up event)\nPlayer A gets the item back ( recovery event)\n\nThis is the patent they filed with Arceus.\n\nI'm pretty sure prior art exists for that\n\nSierra's The Realm had that mechanic.\n\nThere are many MMORPGs where you lose your stuff you're carrying when you die and another player can pick it up, or you can retrieve it if you come back to your corpse.\n\nWhat's so special about that?\n\nZero shot that holds up if that is the patent\n\nSo... they patented the Soulsborne system for when you die?\n\nNot exactly. In arceus, you find items dropped by *other* players, and interacting with them sends them back to whoever lost them.\n\nAh. Ok.\n\nNow that's fucking cool.\n\nIsn’t that in Nier? You can salvage the fallen player android or send something back to the owner of the dead body?\n\nYeap, to a tea. this is also the same or similar to the one in nioh 2, its a pretty common mech. Even dark souls has a similar mechanic with estus flasks and message ratings.\n\nNo way that holds up. Been in games for ages.\n\nThe Patent part was really surprising\n\nA lot of people joked that Palworld copied homework in character designs. But those would be under creative property infringement\n\nPatent implies that specific trademarked technology and features were copied, which is significantly more serious\n\nLooks like Pokemon actually essentially patented the Legends catching system, got it last month as a continuation of a patent application from Sept 2022\n\nEdit from a response to a comment:\n\nThat’s my initial belief as well [that the current 2024 patent would not give cause to sue] , that this current patent would not give grounds to litigate. But for clarification, the current patent was applied for May 2024, granted august 2024. The patent application merely states it is in furtherance of a patent application from Sept 2022. I’m unsure if or when the Sept 2022 application was actually granted and didn’t want to sift through 2 years of Nintendos patents to find out.\n\nThere’s also the chance it’s an entirely different patent, but the timing and nature of this one being so specific to Palworld made it stand out to me. \n\nIn my opinion, they believe they can get Palworld on the Sept 2022 patent and simply filed a new application in furtherance to make it even more airtight in case Palworld tried to adjust their own system to no longer fall under the scope of nintendos patent.\n\nPalworld was in development since 2021, no?\n\nAnd it would be on palworld to demonstrate that they had their system prior to Arceus's patent extension. If they did it should be very easy for them to show timestamped development records/documents of their having the system implemented prior to the patent.\n\nAh. If that's the case then this lawsuit doesn't hold water. Especially if they only applied for the patent in Sept 2022.\n\nIf they were only _**granted**_ the patent last month then they can't sue on the grounds that Palworld violated their patent. Because they didn't have the patent when Palworld was presumably in development.\n\nIn the US, if the invention in question already existed and was created by someone else at the time of the patent application, this is grounds to cancel the patent.\n\nIt’s a Japanese company filing a lawsuit against another Japanese company.\n\nIs the lawsuit in the US, I assumed it was in Japan?\n\n[removed]\n\n[removed]\n\nThe games industry is already bad enough, patents/lawsuits will make it even more dead. People should be able to innovate from a starting point thats already there.\n\nYeah it's absolute shit that Nintendo borrows from other games and then patents their novel aspects to ensure no one else can do the same.\n\nBasically the Disney model for game development.\n\nI hate how a win for Nintendo is a lose for the entire fucking world.\n\nThanks ChatGPT\n\nWhen studio ghibli suing them for yellow totoro\n\nThey waiting for Nintendo to test the waters first\n\nStudio Ghibli is an animation company.\n\nNintendo is a law firm with a games division.\n\nMight makes right\n\n&gt;Nintendo is a law firm with a games division.\n\nLet's not forget they used to dabble in love hotels.\n\n**PATENT** lawsuit!?\n\nHUH!?!?\n\nThat was absolutely not what I expected. This had nothing to do with copying IP, character designs, or other creative property\n\nPatent implies specific tech matters like gameplay systems or coding was copied\n\nAlternatively it could be for an entirely different game not related to Pokemon entirely\n\nA lot of people here are saying that this may be related to the “catching monsters with a ball” thing, but I don’t see how they could patent that? I mean, wouldn’t the code be the same whether the used a ball, cube or any other shape? “Pokéball” is not a mechanic\n\nPatents can be as vague as general ideas. In the US, the idea of having buttons on the back of a controller is patented.\n\nPatents also come with expiration dates, the international standard is 20 years. Pokemon Red came out in 1996, so even if they did have a patent it would've expired 8 years ago.\n\nAlso true, but they could've filed new parents on any number of ideas and systems that have gone into the new games. We won't really know until the actual court docs are made public.\n\n[removed]\n\nMore likely here would be a mechanic they patented for Let's Go Pikachu or Legends Arceus, not the original games I'd think.\n\nThe lawsuit is in Japan. Not the US.\n\nNot really code, could just be an entire gameplay mechanic on its own, like how minigames in loading screens and big ponty arrows on your screen got patented and nobody else could ever used anymore. It would be kinda ballsy (heh) if Nintendo is suing for \"throwing a sphere at a monster in a 3D open world\", but we'll have to wait and see.\n\n[Wouldn't be surprised if it's this patent](https://patents.justia.com/patent/20240278129)\n\nSounds like the Legends Arceus open field catching system, which Palworld is super similar to.\n\n&gt;Thus, by switching between the first mode and the second mode, the player character can be caused to perform different actions, i.e., an action of launching, at a field character as a target on a field, an item that affects the field character, and an action of launching a fighting character that fights against a field character on a field, according to an operation input for causing the player character to perform a launching action in the direction indicated by an aiming point.\n\n&gt;The item may include at least a catching item for catching the field character. The game program may further cause the computer to perform operations comprising: when the catching item launched in the first mode hits the field character, performing successful-catch determination relating to whether or not the catching is successful; and when the result of the successful-catch determination is positive, setting the field character hit by the catching item in a player's possession.\n\n&gt;Thus, the user can choose whether to catch a field character or cause a fighting character to fight against a field character.\n\nCraftopia had that years before Palworld.  And it was planned and/or implemented before that patent IIRC.\n\nI have to think that would be at serious risk for either not being novel enough to be patentable, or having prior art somewhere in the world.\n\nAny legal experts know the difference between this and something like Digimon? You can’t own magic or pets, or any combination of the sorts.\n\nIt's a patent infringement lawsuit, not copyright. So it's likely related to some gameplay systems.\n\nGameplay systems.  Hmmm....\n\nDigimon evolve.\n\nSo do Pokémon. \n\nCheckmate Monster Ranchers.\n\nDigimon actually go through Digivolution it’s a completely different process!\n\nNotably pals don’t evolve\n\nthere's stuff even older than Digimon. Megami Tensei goes way back\n\nHack is even earlier than SMT\n\nAfter experiencing both franchises, Digimon and Pokemon are a lot more different than people lead on. Only real similarities are having monsters that evolve. Can't even what monster catching system they have if they have it but i only really remember them having 1 partner.\n\nDigimon has no mechanism for catching monsters in any iteration. That's one of the main fundamental differences between the two series.\n\nPeople still think they do for some reason. lol\n\nIt’s worth noting as well that even the ‘evolving’ works differently in each. Pokemon evolve into a higher form and then can never go back. Digimon digivolve into a stronger form for a short time and then revert back to their weaker form. Funnily enough Pokemon did eventually add digivolving into the games with mega-evolutions\n\nGame mechanic patents are pure cancer. The crazy taxi arrow, the Namco little games during loading screens…. They kill innovation where everything is an evolution of a previous concept. Nintendo didn’t invent jumping over things and they built an empire on that mechanic.\n\nAs a game dev for a living, I don't know a single developer (as in, actual developer, not lawyer or corporate idiot working for a game development company) that has a single positive thing to say about patents on anything digital. It's blindingly obvious to everybody who actually understands anything about the way games (and, frankly, computer programs in general) are made that the whole concept behind patents (how they are supposed to incentivize putting more resources into R&amp;D) simply does not apply in this field.\n\nYou can at least make an argument for why patents are \"good\" when it comes to pharmaceuticals or heavy industry or stuff like that, where R&amp;D is genuinely capital-intensive and risky (I still don't think that kind of patent is a net societal positive overall, but you can at least make a case for them that isn't built on diluted farts). For software/games? There is nothing. \"Research\" isn't capital intensive. Almost all patents that have ever been granted in the field are quite literally one guy thinking about the problem for 5 minutes and patenting the first idea that wasn't complete shit. And on the flip side, I have *never* in my professional life, and I mean *never once*, heard of someone looking through patents for ideas on how to do something, which is supposedly half of their intended purpose: incentivizing companies to release their \"secrets\" to the world in exchange for a time-limited monopoly on them. Because the ideas are so self-evident that it'd be faster to come up with them again, and even if you were going to \"copy\" them, you can do that by simply using the damn product, which once again displays how little need for patents there is in the field.\n\nBut you know what I *have* seen devs, or, more realistically, lawyers paid by devs, go through the patents list looking for? Things they can't do, because somebody else patented them. That's all it's good for. Arbitrarily limiting what companies can do, while ensuring IP lawyers have job security and, by extension, that game development is significantly more expensive for absolutely no upside. Fuck patents.\n\n&gt; I don't know a single developer (as in, actual developer, not lawyer or corporate idiot working for a game development company) that has a single positive thing to say about patents on anything digital. \n\nTo this day I still remember the famous n-LinkedList that was being paraded around by patent trolling lawyers from LSI.  LinkedLists (and doubly/triple/n linked lists) are a data structure that predates the patent by almost 50 years (mid/late 1950s vs early 00s).\n\nPatent: https://patents.google.com/patent/US7028023B2/en\n\n(Side note: the person who patented it patents a lot of \"already invented\" tech or ideas)\n\nThe Shadow of War Nemesis system.\n\nGod it hurts WB patented the nemesis system to never use it again\n\nSo Nintendo waited until Palworld made a bunch of money huh?\n\nIt's easier to get a bunch of money out of someone once they have a bunch of money to lose.\n\nThis guy moneys\n\nI wish I money’d\n\nMight have just taken this long to go over every possible way they could go after Palworld and build the strongest case they could.\n\nI'm suspecting that's the actual reason.  You don't default to game play patents on something that leans parallels that close to one of your main IPs unless nothing else can potentially stick.\n\nIf they couldn't make a \"look at how similar all these models are to pokemon, that's infringement\" stick, they're probably desperate.\n\nThey've gone down this \"derivative works\" patent style lawsuit rabbit hole before with the game genie and it bit them right in the ass.  Maybe the systems will be different enough, though I'm not hopeful because I don't think Japanese courts typically favor the defendant.\n\nOK this is not the kind of lawsuit that people were expecting. It's not a trade mark or copyright/infringement like most people would have thought it to be, but a patent lawsuit. That's VERY different in claims and it's something that is VERY specific that the game is doing.\n\nNo where does it say WHAT those patent infringements are though so it's hard to say. Depending on what they are this COULD (although extremely unlikely) come back to bite Nintendo if it is found that the patents they are claiming are too broad and overstep the vision of the patent.\n\nEdit: granted this is done in Japanese court so things can be very different.\n\nAnother day, another Nintendo lawsuit.\n\nLet's see how this one goes.\n\nFuck software patents\n\nWhat is Nintendo's batting average on shit like this? I remember them always winning and being unnecessarily cruel/extra about it.\n\nCatching mechanic has been around before Pokémon. Just look at Gerbils and hamsters 🐹 in a ball 🤷‍♂️\n\nShin megami tensei had them beat by like 10 years if we’re talking about video games.\n\nAye but the specific catching mechanic isn’t in Megami Tensei. You negotiate or fuse demons in SMT, which is different from Pokemon even if they are still both monster collection games\n\nI want Nintendo to lose\n\nTime to grab the popcorn\n\nMaybe the reason they are doing this now instead of before is because of the recent announcement about Palworld Mobile? Crafton said that they are working with Pub Studio on this not too long ago which means Palworld might be competing with Nintendo on the portable gaming market.\n\nI hope they fucking lose.\n\nIf you follow Nintendo's litigious history. They don't even need to win to actually win.\n\nI know, some of their lawsuits seem to be won by bleeding their victims dry until they can't afford to defend themselves anymore in court.\n\nWhich is so shitty, so instead of embracing the first real competition they’ve ever had they are choosing to run their competitor out of business so they can keep pushing out crappy half baked games uncontested\n\nIt's rare for a monster collecting game to do extremely well, and when it finally does, Nintendo sues. Fuck them. If only they used that money to make Pokemon better instead.\n\nThe wild part is that Palworld isn't even really a monster collecting game.\n\nIt's a survival game like Ark that happens to have monster catching.\n\nIt genuinely wouldn't be compared to Pokémon at all if some of the designs didn't look like Wish versions of Pokémon\n\nIn a few years time Pokémon games might be up to Dreamcast era graphics.  Please understand, they are a small indie developer you know, very few financial resources, so they can't be making games with every Pokémon and feature.\n\nah yes, nintendos favorite hobby. sueing people.\n\nThe biggest thing here for those of us in the US is we need to understand this is all under Japanese law. Things like fair use don't exist there, and under their legal stricture broader patent and such maybe possible or they may use words like parents and trademarks in a more similar way.\n\nWe need to have some individuals with more specific knowledge break so we can understand the nuance. The pokémon company and Nintendo are both large enough and intelligent enough that they likely would not be bringing a suit if they did not believe they could win.\n\nIf anyone can win a software patent case, it’s Nintendo, but I’m not sure they’ll win here. Basic premises are a lot harder to patent than the nuances of game play.\n\nCatching enemies to use as allies certainly isn’t unique to Nintendo.\n\nAlthough… honestly, the game plays like a mashup of Valhiem and modern Zelda.\n\nI wonder if it’s the *Zelda* patents that they’re trying to enforce. That might have more teeth.\n\nThe fact they didn't go after copyright or trademarks is fascinating.\n\nBut that they did go after patents instead is even more interesting, as numerous other games (people have listed lots of them) have mechanics like Palworld has, but Nintendo hasn't sued them."

    "all_comment_text": "Everything was inspired by Akira.\n\nEverything with a motorcycle at least.  Akira slide.\n\nI remember seeing Akira slides without motorcycles involved, tho.\n\nI know there's a handful of horse Akira slides\n\nThe occasional tricycle as well\n\nCatch me when they do that in a diesel locomotive\n\nLike I'm not using that bike in every playthrough I do in cyberpunk 2077. They know what they did to me!\n\nevery god damn time\n\n[deleted]\n\nYou practically have kaneda's bike.  How could you not\n\n[Akira Slide](https://youtu.be/A9hCzjBc7Q4?feature=shared)\n\nI love that Jordan Peele gave us [a live-action version of it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-C9GaCgrMA), in Nope, of all things.\n\nI think Akira was inspired by Blade Runner\n\nDon't think so, both the manga and Blade Runner came out in 1982.\n\n[deleted]\n\nBlade Runner came out in 1982, Neuromancer didn't release until 1984. There's a story William Gibson tells of leaving the theater with tears in his eyes because he saw the world he was creating already up on screen.\n\nAkira doesn't have much to do with either of those sources, though. It's more the look of Bladerunner that people think Akira borrowed from.\n\nBlade runner is an adaptation of a book: Do androids dream of electric sheep? from 1968. So its not out there for akira to be inspired by that as far as timing is concerned.\n\nPeople think inspiration means copy and paste.  It's so much more.  Both Blade Runner and Akira are great and have their own take in the sci-fi dystopian genre.\n\nTo be fair, Blade Runner and DADOES? are actually very different. The core plot is the same, but the cyberpunk aesthetic (among other things) is almost completely original to the film.\n\nEven cyberpunk aesthetics aside Akira and Blade Runner/DADOES are vastly different stories.\n\nThere is no similarity between Akira and Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?.\n\nNone.\n\nYeah, people who say stuff like this have never read Electric Sheep. That book is weird, and although it was the inspiration for Blade Runner, it's the visual aesthetic of the _film_ that is most commonly referenced by derivative works.\n\nI need to rewatch Akira, that art still holds up.\n\nI need to watch Akira, holy shit that animation is crazy\n\nWatch Ghost in the Shell after\n\nGhost in the Shell is incredible, and if that's the comparison you're drawing, I'm super excited for this\n\nOne of the most influential films of all time not even just in the animated or Anime genre. The one scene of Kaneda peeling out on his bike away from the camera was so technically superior, it has been reproduced numerous times in other media.\n\nSomeone post the slide compilation!!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9hCzjBc7Q4\n\nKaneda's bike slide is to animators what Whilhelm scream is to audio editors, something you have to use every chance you get.\n\nYu-gi-oh really liked it.\n\nIt was an entire anime based on dueling on motorcycles.\n\nOf course they referenced it to death\n\nYu-gi-og and motorcycles isn't a match I was expecting.\n\nShit I still need to watch FLCL Alt\n\nFuck that shit. Stick to the original.\n\nI like how Gurren Lagann is in there\n\nI think the most recent iteration of the Kaneda slide I saw was in Nope\n\nShadow has been shown doing the Kaneda Slide in the Sonic 3 trailer. The legend continues.\n\nI love Nope doing because it like tests different compositional skills to get to work.\n\nLike, in theory, one mad artist can make the Akira slide work, spending their life to do so, with someone else just taking the photos, or already having a digital storage system to convert stills into frames\n\nNope requires replicating the feel on set.\n\nYou need to produce a motorcycle sliding gracefully, put something that can be confused for a person, or an actual person on that bike, and point a camera at that. \n\nYou can't do that with one person.\n\nSame. I giggled like a little kid.\n\nNo Akira no Matrix.\n\nNo Akira no Final Fantasy VII. \n\nThe memories... One of the first games that truly made me wish my working day was over and get back to that PSX &lt;3\n\nAnd holy shit that *score*! I would never have thought of marimba and voice for a cyberpunk bike battle, but it’s one of the best moments in film score history. Also gamelans in a futuristic setting was a bold choice that completely worked.\n\nThe Kaneda slide is on par with the Yamcha pose in terms of how profilic their homages are in media.\n\nAkira is so good!! I’m really excited for you watching it for the first time.\n\nEven just the sound tracks of both movies are amazing.\n\nYou'll start making connections as to what other media since has drawn inspiration from Akira, both in terms of style and plot.\n\nThen watch \"ghost in the shell 2\", the art in that is sublime, there's a shot of one of the characters cars that has over 200 layers to achieve the effects.\n\nAlso \"Redline\" (2009) is another incredibly good looking and hand drawn (I believe) movie.\n\nAlso got to mention the cowboy bebop movie for great animation, the roto scoped scene that opens the movie is still unmatched for me.\n\nEdit: apparently the opening of cowboy bebop isn't rotoscoped, apologies. However this knowledge just makes that opening even more amazing to me, unbelievable skill.\n\nEdit 2: just wanted to second \"paprika\" as it's beautiful and intense. Also I remember watching \"sword of the stranger\" and thinking that the animation was really fluid and impressive, I don't know anything about it's making though.\n\n[deleted]\n\n&gt; it ranks among my favorite movies despite it's ^^^^^^^sic shortcomings in the story department\n\nIt also has boobies.\n\nAlmost bankrupted the studio in the process.\n\nThey had it up on youtube for years. It's one of the best hand-animated movies. \n\nPeriod.\n\nFucking hell that was awesome.\n\nBoth of those are phenomenal. I watch GITS just for the cloaked fight scene, absolutely bonkers.\n\nRedline is so amazing. I love it!\n\nI think Shinichirō Watanabe said at a convention panel that they never used rotoscoping.\n\nPaprika is also a fantastic anime with great art\n\nThe original release not 2.0.\n\nThis is important.\n\nAnd Ninja Scroll\n\nAnd then the two Patlabor Movies\n\nOh man, patlabor 2 is *so* good.\n\nAnd then Spriggan then Blue Submarine no. 6\n\nThe bike slide scene in Akira is probably one of the most recreated scenes in animation.\n\nLive action does it too\n\nYou’re in for a hell of an experience of it’s your first time. \n\nI remember watching it as a kid when it first came out and being floored by it. The aesthetic just made something click in my brain. It’s also a phenomenal film.\n\nAkira and X. \n\nBuddy loaned me those on VHS when I was like 10.  Only Anime I'd seen at that point was DBZ. \n\nThat weekend changed my life lmao. I went down the 90's anime rabbit hole. Ghost in the Shell, Vampire Hunter, Gundam, Deep Blue, Berserk and all that.\n\nI had Deep Blue on VHS somewhere, that and all of Trigun and Serial Experiments Lain.  I spent too much as a teenager at Suncoast...\n\nMy daughter is in her teens and had only known current anime.  I'd show her old stuff sometimes and she would be like, it's neat but kind of boring.  Then I showed her Akira and she reacted almost the same way I did when I was like 11.\n\n  \nIt's an actual masterpiece.\n\nOld made for television anime was hit or miss.  If it had a decent budget, you'd have some of the most gorgeous hand painted backgrounds ever with fairly decent animation.  If it didn't, it was obviously made for cheap with still images with zoom effects to try and hide the lack of animation.\n\nRurouni Kenshin season one fell in between, where they had a good budget for art but not a lot for animation, hence why a lot of the fight scenes were just cut to black slash or still images of their faces with slash lines going across the screen.  Story held that one together.\n\nPoint is....people diss on modern anime because it's 90% done on the computer, even if it's still hand drawn, but honestly it's still better than a vast majority of what we got back in the 80s and early 90s.  The *aesthetic* however, has changed.  They could easily do the same aesthetic using modern drawing techniques, but refuse to.\n\nI feel like some new gundam is a good example of people using computers to generate animation but keeping the older style of animation.  Not 100% but there's way more of it there than I've seen in other series.  And I agree, it's incredible when they combine both.\n\nThere is like a 2 second clip of swirling vapors in Akira that will make any art student lose their shit. I heard that the clip took the animation studio 2-3 months to create, and IT SHOWS. \n\nAkira is one of the best pieces of animation ever made by a long shot, and the Manga that the movie is from covers twice as much story, telling one of the best sci fi narratives I've ever experienced. \n\n\"Masterpiece\" doesn't do it justice.\n\nGod, the manga is like holding an IMAX movie in your hands.\n\nFYI, there was a FULLY COLORED version of the entire thing released in the past, and it's all available to read online. The illustration of Tetsuo floating in space with the moon taking up nearly the entire background? \n\nThat illustration is AMAZING in full-color. Just... completely amazing.\n\nIt's hand drawn.\n\nThe OVA generation was full of amazing works of art.\n\nMetropolis is another thing to look at if you haven't. Redline, for the most modern example.\n\nI miss OVAs....\"here's a pile of cash for you to go and do something experimental have fun\".  Got some of the best random anime.  Key the Metal Idol, Memories, Robot Carnival, Steamboy....nowadays everything is churned out to appease nostalgia or whatever is currently popular.  And that's not JUST anime.\n\nBro, you got a long list of old 90s anime to watch. It’s so much better than the new stuff.\n\nPerfect Blue\n\nNinja Scroll\n\nCowboy Bebop\n\nEct…\n\n&gt; Perfect Blue\n\nI thought this would be another boring ass artsy movie, but it was very surprising. These Hollywoodian “slow burns” could take a page from its book.\n\nAll of Satoshi Kon movies are exceptional.\n\nPaprika is another top one. Dude passed away too young at 46.\n\nTokyo Godfathers is my favourite Christmas movie.\n\nAranovsky certainly loves copying Perfect Blue\n\nThe music is a huge part of that scene as well: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hglrXwyE4xU\n\nI had never seen it and I took my 14 year old to a local theater that was screening it last year…. Absolutely deserves all the hype. The animation is truly timeless.\n\nRewatched it a few months ago. My wife isn’t really into anime, but will give things I am interested in a chance. She doesn’t always like what I’m watching, but that’s fair, we each have our own tastes. So, figuring she won’t be all that interested I fire it up while I’m eating lunch. I’ve got my surround sound up pretty loud. She comes out and asks what I’m watching. I reply the usual stuff, most groundbreaking animated film etc. She sits down. 15 minutes later she says, “this is really weird”. “Yeah, it only gets more weird”, I replied. We watch mostly in silence till the end, and she says, “what the fuck did I just watch?” That’s not to mean she didn’t enjoy it, more that it had its intended effect. That’s my Akira story. Thanks for listening.\n\nHahaha I sat down my teenage daughter (16 at the time) and was like \"You need to watch this\" and had almost word for word the exact same reaction\n\nThat is more or less how everybody's first watch goes. Art direction is 10/10 but I think most people start to get uncomfortable around the point the wrinkled children show up.\n\nYeah it goes from blade runner to berserk pretty quick\n\nYou left out the part where you yelled Tetsuo, completely selling the “gets more weird”.\n\nNot only does it hold up it still leaves many films in its dust.\n\nStill holds up? Bruh the city, the opening, that 2 and a half minutes is some of the most detailed architecture and fine detail I’ve seen in animation. And all of those animation frames? They were only used in the opening. Thinking about the sheer amount of hours that went into it is insane. Also, I’m a fan of Akira.\n\n[removed]\n\nFor audiophiles:\n\nIf you get it on 4K, make sure you get the Japanese version and watch with the Japanese track. Standard Region 1 Blu-ray has the same Japanese track as the Japanese version, so no worries about importing there.\n\nOf course, this only matters if you have the right equipment. You need a processor that can handle it properly, and speakers capable of reproducing the high res audio.\n\nIt's one of the few movies with audio encoded at 192kHz, 24-bit.\n\nCheck out a follow up piece called “Memories”. It’s on Prime and it was done by a lot of the same artists. I never hear it spoken about but in my eyes it’s up there with Akira in terms of quality story telling and beautiful visual art.\n\nMe too, but I’m still getting over my trauma from the giant mutated blob scene though. Maybe I’ll give it another year or 10.\n\n&gt; that art still holds up.\n\nit holds up better than Ops link did\n\nI never watched it until a few years ago, I got to see it in a local theater. \n\nHonestly, not at all what I was expecting from what I've heard and read about it.\n\nAnimation is god tier, and there's nothing like it, but plot wise it came out of left field for me because it didn't match the expectations I had.\n\nYeah it’s overhyped at this point because it is such a legendary movie and incredibly beautifully animated. They cut so much out of the manga to make the movie that honestly the plot doesn’t make a whole lot of sense.\n\nIIRC this came out while the manga was still being made, so the mangaka decided to change the protagonist to a side character and tell \"their story\". Or something like that.\n\nBecause it's hand drawn.\n\nThere’s a flying scene in heavy metal that is like 3d animation except it was hand drawn and done in 1981\n\n[You talking about the WW2 Fighter Pilot segment? Because yeah. That's great.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtH0ZF6u0Hc)\n\nI know it's rotoscoped, but it's still awesome.\n\nNo Taarna's flight\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic0pAU8Ud98](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic0pAU8Ud98)\n\nEven better. Couple of great examples of how good hand drawn animation can look like CG.\n\nHeavy metal is beautiful, just watched it again this week. Totally written by a horny 14 year old tho \n\n[https://media.giphy.com/media/l0HlK3RyTkaJIfRJu/200.gif](https://media.giphy.com/media/l0HlK3RyTkaJIfRJu/200.gif)\n\n aikra is probably the most influential anime of all time\n\nIf it wasn't for Akira, Kishimoto wouldn't have got back into drawing and wouldn't have made Naruto (my favorite shounen)\n\nDid you ever check out his brother's manga, 666 Satan? Nobody ever mentions it but it was great, one of my favorites actually.\n\nholy shit a wild comment referencing 666 satan, take my upvote\n\nI've found my people!\n\nGhost in the Shell is close but Akira is absolutely #1\n\nGhost in the Shell is one of those movies that I love despite not actually liking all that much.\n\nI know that sounds odd, but what I mean is that there are whole huge parts of it that I love.  It asks big important questions about the human condition, which is rad.  It has fantastic art at times, and when the plot turns to action, it is phenomenal.  I like the characters at times, the gist of the plot, and still other things.\n\n*But*...I find that watching the movie is tedious.  Part of it is probably a style choice (and I try to not hold that against anyone), but a *giant* part of it is that I think the movie does a generally poor job of *conveying* it's plot and helping us understand the characters.  Watching it feels like a chore.  In effect I love the parts but the whole just doesn't really work for me, and I'm not even sure that I think it's the movie's fault.  (I could level the same criticisms against many a famous anime, after all, so perhaps it is communicating things via means I do not perceive or makes assumptions about what I'll guess when I very much don't.)\n\n-Edit\n\nAlso:  The sound in general and music in particular are things that I adore.  The title track is buried in my various running playlists and has been for a very long time for a reason.\n\nCompletely agree with you. Themes aproached are great, movie direction, not so good.\n\nThat and Ninja Scroll.\n\nI don't think we can pin any one anime production as *the* most influential.\n\nLeiji-verse anime proved that anime can have very adult themes and drama.\n\nAkira proved anime can have a high production value.\n\nDB/Z kickstarted the shonen genre that has dominated manga and anime for decades.\n\nUrusei Yatsura laid the groundwork for the magical girlfriend genre, began the concept of using pop music for opening/endings, and kickstarted the (ironically) more domestic humor.  It also started and/or elevated *MANY* animator's and director's careers, such as Mamoru Oshii.  And it was one of the very first fan translated series that kickstarted the trend in the 90s.\n\nSo yea, there's no one most influential anime, but several that were made in the 70s/80s/early 90s that all contributed to the boom we saw in the late 90s/00s.\n\nAnd then.....*sigh*......isekei came along.....\n\n&gt;And then.....sigh......isekei came along.....\n\n\"I was reincarnated in a world where the 90s anime boom was still ongoing and now my VCR is in love with me!\"\n\nI'd watch it\n\nThat’s the problem! \n\nEva deserves a shoutout among these imo\n\nAstro Boy is the most influential.\n\nI was about to say where's the respect for Astro Boy?\n\nAll these comments of people being blown away by the art on Akira for the first time makes my heart happy\n\nFr peak anime art style under appreciated, same goes for bebop\n\nThe lady with the eye patch was also totally Sigourney Weaver\n\nIt's Halley Gross, she's an actress but she's also the narrative lead and co-writer on The Last of Us Part 2\n\nIn my opinion the voice did not match the character at all.\n\nThe voice reminded me of Natasha Lyonne, but younger. I'd say 20's. Natasha is in her 40's and the character looks more like she's in her 50's. I like her voice, but I agree that it felt off.\n\nI was thinking that as well.\n\nyeah. it feels like she should sound like a 70 year old woman. instead she just sounds like a 20 year old twitch streamer\n\nI was getting major Sigourney ViBes from the main character\n\nI got Sigourney vibes from the picture of Kumail Nanjiani.\n\n[removed]\n\nAnd anyone who has only seen the movie should check out the manga. It's amazing and a way bigger story than the movie. The movie barely covers anything and is very different.\n\nYep. Movie feels incomplete after reading the manga.\n\nThe movie's strength is the animation. That's why everyone should watch it. The story is meh, just like in most 2H anime movies.\n\nPlot felt really incomplete for me so it was hard to get into the hype\n\nAkira the character isn't even in the movie!!!\n\nIt's iconic and influential because it's was *the* anime that made people realised that adult content could be made from the medium, and has amazing animation that still holds up. But as far as content goes it's alright.\n\nThe Cowboy Bebop of anime movies. Personally it's not even in my top 5.\n\nYeah. I agree with this take. I think a bunch of people are about to watch it and be like \"lol wut?\"\n\nI had this same reaction with ghost in the shell seeing it recently for the first time ever. Sometimes if you see influential media too late it just doesn’t hit the same.\n\nPerfect blue however absolutely lived up to the hype everyone gave it.\n\nground breaking at the time, doesn't mean that it remains excellent. Akira is fine, but you really have to be able to put it in context of it's time.\n\nI've watched it twice and it just didn't connect to me. The world building was incredible, but I wish they told a different story within said world.\n\nWhat am I missing?\n\nSaw it first when I was a kid, probably 12 or 13. Blown away. I finally rewatched it like 15 years later and I gotta say, it really didn't hold up to the perception I had of it from my childhood\n\n[deleted]\n\nIt is sad to say that a lot of people are and all for the wrong reasons.\n\n[deleted]\n\nI’m just annoyed people are reading so much into an announcement trailer like this. Same with The Witcher 4. I saw people in the comments genuinely angry and disappointed the game wasn’t silent-character led, an idea that came about from literally nowhere based on nothing whatsoever except a single render image of a lynx medallion in the snow. \n\nWith this game, people are immediately extrapolating *what kind* of game it’ll be, despite the video not giving a single hint, really. It just sets up the most general, basic outline of the setting and story, that’s it. \n\nI love sci-fi and I love Akira, so no wonder this video got me hyped. Doesn’t mean I won’t also wait for more details before I put any hopes into it. People are so weird sometimes.\n\nNeil and ND have become a target for chuds ever since the last of us part 2. It's extremely toxic and breathtakingly pathetic.\n\njust realised ND can stand for both Neil Druckmann and Naughty Dog\n\nWhat isn't inspired by Akira. If you wanna do sci fi or cyberpunk, gotta throw in an Akira reference.\n\nI was getting Cowboy BeBop Universe vibes this whole trailer.\n\nThe second part, after the very obvious Akira \"homage,\" is literally right from the opening sequence of Cowboy Bebop.\n\nI mean, if someone wanted to make a bounty hunter Bebop game, I wouldn't complain. Shit, I would probably actually spend the cash to get the OST because, if done right, the songs on that game would slap.\n\nSongs are done by no other than Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross. They gonna slap regardless.\n\nIt's Trent Reznor, so it'll slap\n\nThe game is also inspired by cowboy bebop aswell\n\ntime for another akira rewatch, thank you.\n\nA lot of stuff people like is inspired by Akira. GOAT anime movie for a reason\n\nI love Tati Gabrielle omg.  I couldn’t believe it during the preview, and the music is amazing.\n\nSoundtrack is gonna slam. Reznor and Ross throwing down and on ARES OST too!!!\n\nLooks 80's retrofuturism. I'm guessing some alternate history?\n\nTo be fair, almost everything was inspired by Akira.\n\nBut this is definitely an homage\n\nCowboy Bebop\n\nIt was very blunt with the colour usage, you cannot watch this and not think about Kaneda and his gang.\n\nThe list of media not influenced by or referencing Akira is probably shorter than the opposite.\n\nAkira is some cult classic shit for real good reasons.  \nIt inspired generations and probably many more.\n\nAkira is not a cult classic it is just a regular classic.\n\nKanye West cites Akira as his biggest creative inspiration \n\nThe reach goes everywhere with Akira\n\nAkira...cult classic...what?\n\nAkira. I love you.\n\nReddit the game\n\nI watched the awards live last night and hung out on the gaming thread and eventually I just had to back out because it got so fucking gross. So negative. \n\nOne I kept seeing was “uh! Why won’t this just end!” Like… is someone making you people watch this!?\n\nI gotta stop looking at post game discourse in general. There was so many insane announcements here, and wanted to see a lot of chat about them, but I legitimately think there’s nothing that can satisfy the general gaming public\n\nPeople mad at Ciri as new protagonist despite Geralt’s story being confirmed over\n\nPeople upset at ND using real world brands as corps despite it being established in the genre\n\nLike fuuuck, I can’t help but think half of us hate this hobby and just live to be contrarian and feel like they personally could have better directed every reveal\n\nIt is *exhausting*. Motherfuckers, Onimusha's coming back, Virtua Fighter's coming back, *OKAMI* is coming back, we're getting a new game from the Shadow of the Colossus devs, Naughty Dog finally gets to make a new IP, and all I see are people bitching about The Last of Us Part II coming to PC. \n\n\n\nSome people just live to be miserable.\n\nyeah Reddit's darling, Naughty Dog\n\nBarely anything about the game but people have made shit up from nothing just to get mad at it lmao.\n\nTypical.\n\nRegardless of whatever the game winds up being, I'm confident the soundtrack is going to be fucking great. I'm always stoked to hear more music from Trent and Atticus.\n\nthe whole Game Awards was Reddit the Awards\n\nNot based on the hissy fit over silly robot beating monkey dark souls.\n\nIt might be inspired by Akira visually, but will that mean it's good?\\`Probably not. Should rewatch Akira though.\n\nWhen it’s big companies, “inspiration”.\n\nWhat wasn't inspired by Akira?\n\nProbably Akira\n\nThe only unrealistic thing is a CD lasting that long into the far future.\n\nWe still produce vinyls today so maybe they are still producing cds in the future.\n\nEspecially when they're using CRT monitors. Retro tech is part of this future, not just a throwback.\n\nI’m sure it was inspired by a lot of 80a anime\n\nI got cowboy bebop vibes from the anime playing on the monitor\n\nYeah the director said Akira and Cowboy Bewop were the main inspiration behind the game.\n\nLast boss is going to be fucking wild then.\n\nHow do you say \"no shit\" without being rude?\n\nThere's things about this reveal that don't really get me all that excited but the confidence I have in Naughty Dog is un-wavered.\n\nThe art direction is also incredibly awesome. Love the 80's future vibe.\n\nAbsolutely baffled by the reaction to this game.\n\nWow, you mean a retro-futuristic sci-fi game was inspired by one of the most well known and influential retro-futuristic sci-fi movies? Holy hell, next you're gonna tell me that a modern fantasy series is inspired by Lord of the Rings.\n\nA LOT of things were inspired by AKIRA.\nIt's a seminal anime for a reason.\n\nI’m excited as hell for this game.  Naughty Dog in outer space is not something I was aware I yearned for, but here we are.\n\nBro never played Crash 2. \n\n(/s just in case)"

    "all_comment_text": "I remember everyone and their mom hating steam when it first launched.\n\nWell...yeah, it was a bloody nightmare. The game needed Steam for no good reason (it was a single-player game), it took ages to download, then hours to decode when it finally launched. I literally could have walked to the store, bought a CD, came back home, installed and played before the Steam version finished decoding, to say nothing of downloading. There were very good reasons to hate Steam early on. I suffered though it when I had to, but I didn't start actively using it until 2010s.\n\nExactly. It had a ton of issues when it first released and not a lot of obvious benefits either. It also took awhile for it to really get polished and come into its own. I was annoyed because HL2’s code had been leaked and the games release date was pushed. I just wanted to play that game so bad, I didn’t want to mess with steam!\n\nI didn't get involved with Steam until the Orange Box was released.  That was my first real intro to FPS games in general, and I think at that point steam was just getting to the point of not being a huge issue, but I still bought games physically when I could.\n\nBack then it only *had* the Valve catalogue and like 3 indie games. The only reason you'd have Steam installed was for Valve games.\n\nBut thankfully, now it's a substantial distributor of digital games; arguably the best in the business. I say arguably, since there are aspects of Steam that could definitely be improved (like actually being able to own and transfer your bought copies), but it's still the head horse in a race where most of its competitors are lame mules.\n\nOn the one hand, it speaks to the quality of Valve's service, but on the other hand, one could be less charitable and say that \"in the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king\".\n\nSteam's one of the very few spaces on the internet or increasingly in life that isn't monetising your engagement outside of its marketplace/catalogue.\n\nThe reason i still use steam as a primary communication method with some friends is because it just wants to be a chat tool and nothing more. Honestly, Gabe missed a trick by not turning steam friends into what discord is. Until discord started to pick up...steam (whoops), it was THE place to communicate with gamer friends.\n\nNever thought of it before but that is true. I’m not going to fault him for that when hindsight is 20/20 but they definitely could have leveraged that position.  \n\nBut I mean it’s not like they didn’t know, I just think they were thinking about competing against stuff like TeamSpeak rather than being something like discord\n\nAll he had to do was add voice rooms and it would have taken off. Mumble and TeamSpeak were a pain to set up/host for most. Just being able to invite and talk was what people wanted for gaming.\n\nTo be fair, I don't know if this was necessarily a mistake though. Discord is an enormous money pit sustained almost entirely through venture capital, and likely data harvesting.\n\nEveryone in PC gaming still pretty much exclusively uses Steam either way, except now someone else has to pick up the slack for the data storage costs.\n\ncoming from irc getting a channel that uploads images for free was weird.\n\ndude, valve brought gamble boxes to the mainstream and had to be scolded to crack down on child gambling predators. they are super monetized to fuck years before most others.\n\n&gt; outside of its marketplace/catalogue\n\nnull\n\nAnd boy am I glad they did. The Steam Deck is hands down my favorite piece of technology I've ever owned.\n\nYup.  Steam has a lot of problems still.  It's BRUTAL to developers who want their game on it.\n\nThat was the big splash Epic made to start, when they launched their own store.  They said they were going to give a bigger portion of proceeds to the developers.  And that got a LOT of people watching them.  It would sure be nice to buy the game for the same price, but know that the developer was getting 88% instead of 70%.\n\nBut for all Epic did, it showed how much it failed to do even more.  Like having a shopping cart took them over 3 years.\n\nAnd Epic DID push Steam to be more competitive.  So that's a win for developers and consumers.  But Epic is like the kid down the street playing against Michael Jordan on the court.  Sure, he might put some points on the board, but he isn't a real threat to Air Jordan's dominance.\n\nSo Steam changed a few small things, like improving developer cuts on large games (sell enough, and Steam takes less).\n\nBut there's still no real push for them to make any sweeping reforms.\n\nYep I think the first steam game I had was audiosurf but that was in like 2008\n\nEven when I got the OB, I ended up not playing the darn games for a year because Steam sucked so bad. \n\nNow, 99% of my games are on steam.\n\nOrange box...wow  core memory unlocked.\n\nhonestly there was no benefit initially because the client was horrible, offline mode was broken, only certain areas of the world had the bandwidth to make it worthwhile and even then installs sometimes just broke mid download. data corruption was also much more common and the recheck feature used to be horrible, sometimes requiring redownloading the whole game. it didn't have the extra features it has now like steam overlay/controller support/easy search for content/community pages like reviews and mods.\n\nIt's not surprising that people didn't think it would work since version that really got popular is nothing like the original version other than the vague concept of downloading games off a client.\n\nHaving to be online to turn on offline mode was a genius idea...\n\nYou have to initially download the game. It's also a security / anti piracy check to verify you own the game before enabling offline mode. \n\nIt *sounds* silly but it makes 100% sense.\n\nExactly. Internet was not only much slower then, but also less stable. Steam was a PITA at first. Obviously it’s everywhere now and has a lot of benefits, but I still think it’s GUI looks old AF.\n\nplease do not change the ui. too many things drop the old ui style and they end up so much less functional in the pursuit of looking nicer.\n\nMy first modem was 2400 baud. Upgraded to 14.4k then 56k. Still abysmally slow. Tried paying $80 for DSL for like a bit faster but not ton faster and couldn't get it connected to my house - too far.\n\nEventually moved in with a coworker and we had 1MB ADSL and it felt like the big leagues. Now that feels so slow. \n\nThink I was paying about $20 for Earthlink dialup, then over $100 for ADSL. 1995 me would be blown away by the gigabit fiber I have now for $50/month. I used to look at T1 line advertisements and drool.\n\nI still remember upgrading from 56k to ISDN. Double the speed, and I could still use the internet while my mom was having two hour phone calls with her friend a few towns over!\n\nI remember upgrading from 56k dial-up to cable. We were in one of the first markets Charter beta tested cable internet in, and we got into it pretty early, around 2000 or so. Not tying up the phone line was a game changer, and 256k bandwidth meant I could download a song off Napster in less time than it took the song to play!\n\n&gt; offline mode was broken\n\nI still remember moving in 2009 and the internet wasn't set up for the first week in the new home. I was like, eh, it'll be fine, I got plenty of games installed :)\n\nSet up my gaming rig and... Steam refuses to go into offline mode without first logging in. Fuck.\n\nNo neighbors with WiFi, no smartphone to tether with, just nothing. I was just completely unable to access my Steam library because I couldn't log in to turn on offline mode. Ughhhhh.\n\nI actually ended up buying a USB data dongle thing so I could have cellular internet for a few days because I couldn't think of anything better (not like I could have googled it or anything).\n\nIt was more than that.  Many/most hated the very concept of Steam\n\nMany still do! RIP ownership of many games.\n\nI used steam just to play TF2 for like 3-4 years until I start to notice there were games other than something valve related. Entire time I thought steam is just a launcher for valve games lol.\n\nPeople really forget how bad internet downloads were even in 2003.  It was about 1-2 Mbps.  Games might have only been an average of 2 GBs but it was a long time getting a game to download, and there was massive amounts of restrictions (not including dial up was 20-40% of all internet connections around that time in the US).\n\nRemember when pre-loading wasn't a thing? Staying up until midnight only to *start* the download at release\n\nOh god, yeah.\n\nAnd how the servers were so overloaded that you could get partway through the download, it failed, and have to redownload the Entire thing because there was no progression save/resume for the games\n\nAnd 1-2 mbps was for cable, the phone line based options were even lower.\n\nWhat's more, they killed WON, the network we played CS (pre 1.6) on, which was working very well and everyone could host a server and there we no restrictions like \"oh your CS or HakfLife version is too old, you can't play\" - as long as the server you connected to supported it, you could play with your old/outdated version (and upgrade later.. i.e. over night.. because dial-up).\n\nWON was also only used to lookup servers - once you found one you liked and knew the IP, you didn't need WON anymore.\n\nWith the switch to steam, we now had to have a current game version h which was a nightmare... The steam servers couldn't handle it and we had mostly dial-up internet back then.. also you couldn't just host a server anymore.\n\nAlso, if steam went down - it would kick you out of CS.. which wasn't the case with WON (see above).\n\nI'm still bitter about it, because a lot of good servers were gone after the switch to steam and I could never find those people again.\n\nIt made me effectively quit playing CS.\n\nI didn't have internet at home when HL2 launched but I really wanted to play it. But it would not launch without communicating with Steam. So I physically moved my entire PC to a friend and installed the game there. It had to update for ages but it finally worked.\n\nThen I moved the PC back and had to learn that offline mode (back then) was completely fucked. So again I could not play the game for several days.\n\nThrough a lot of trial and error I managed to get it working by launching it at my friends place, then turning Steam to offline mode, then relaunching it, then unplugging the internet and then finally launching it.\n\nSteam back then was absolute ass. Took them years to actually make offline mode feasable.\n\nTook me 12 hours to update cs1.6 in 2006\n\nI can’t even tell you how many HL1 mod downloads were ruined because my mom picked up the damn phone.\n\nIt's also arguably less of an issue now. Back then, the servers were *hammered* on launch day, so even if you had Internet at home, it might not work. Now... I mean, it's a much more reasonable assumption that you have Internet at home. I *think* offline mode is better, but I haven't had to test it in over ten years.\n\n&gt; Took them years to actually make offline mode feasable.\n\nYou unlocked some deep memories there I'd forgotten.\n\nReally seemed for years that all going \"offline\" did was just flip the text from online to offline, lol.\n\nRemember how the friends list didn't work for like a decade?\n\nThe worst part was the transition to sending you a physical case with a flipping steam key in it, no disc!\n\n\nWas very annoyed at that transition, would have been fine if it was steam key + cd for non steam usage but nope.\n\nlol portal 2 was a physical disk that only installed 1/4 of the game files, i didn't have internet at the time so i was super pissed.\n\nEven back then it was a godsend for people who lived in the middle of nowhere. I was only a teenager but it was a day round trip to get to a store to buy games back then. Just being able to access new games was incredible.\n\nPeople don’t remember the days of downloading at 80KB/s \n\n“dad why did you turn off the computer I had something downloading overnight!!!! 😭😭😭😭”\n\nEdit: then you finally download the game just to find out it was straight 💩💩💩💩💩💩\n\nMy main issue with Steam is the updating, I can't think of a time where I've been able to turn on my laptop, open Steam and not have to go through an update first which has no timer to tell what's going.\n\nEverything took super long back then...\n\nMy girlfriend and I are blown away that we can download a 70 GIGABYTE GAME now FASTER than we can get ready to even GO TO THE STORE. \n\nLike...by the time it is downloaded, we would have been 4 minutes into our hour long trip. That's insane.\n\n20 years ago you'd have to wait for minutes for a pixelated jubblies picture to load. 🤷 Now you can't stop them from loading\n\nAt least the image loaded top to bottom so you had a few minutes to enjoy those jugs before the giant erection loaded.\n\nI remember someone I knew that didn't have the internet having to take their tower to someone else's house to play Half Life 2.\n\nI personally only just got a broadband connection when Steam first came out, went from 56k dial up to 150k cable broadband. Games were smaller than now, but the internet connections speed were much slower relatively. \n\nA game might be one or two DVDs (18GB) max vs something like the newest COD (140GB), roughly seven times bigger. \n\nBut I had 150kbit connection, it would take 266 hours for those 18GB. I now have a 250MBit connection, and would take 75 minutes to download that newer 140GB game.\n\nI don’t remember it being that miserable. But I also am likely looking back with rose colored glasses.\n\ni can remember only using it for HL2 at launch, and then vowing to never touch it again.   im pretty sure i didnt log back in for a solid 18 months, which by that time it had already improved quite a bit.\n\nI actually lost my first account because any email address or phone number you gave to Steam was instantly burned with spam and telemarketers.  So once I forgot the finger-mash password I discovered that the Hotmail address had long since been purged, and I couldn't get back in.  Worse, I still had the damned Half Life 2 discs and I couldn't play them because the CD key was assigned to the lost account.\n\nI think I stayed away another five years because of that.\n\nI remember computers struggling to make it run smoothly. It was very clunky for the first couple of years.\n\nslap wild abundant alleged public touch society ghost advise pie\n\n&gt; and this was over 56k internet\n\nWhen Gabe says 99% of people thought Steam would fail, I think this is the reason. Internet speeds sucked back then, and 99% of people didn’t have the foresight to see how much of our infrastructure fast internet would become. \n\nNot really.  I mean it's probably part of it, but [this gif](https://www.area51servers.com/images/steamupdate.gif) really does a decent job of outlining the issues old steam used to have\n\nI remember this shit back when every 1.6 pub server had some tiny files to download (like ad banners in random parts of the map or slightly different unreal tournament announcements).\n\nYou couldn't lend games to your friends either.\n\nI was just so confused in the beginning.  Like what's wrong with clicking the Icon on my desktop, why I gotta launch this program to start my game.  But I adapted quickly and grew to love it immediately\n\nGabe dragged us into the future kicking and screaming.\n\nHe dragged me into the future by not making me have to hunt down which of 5 CD pile my 3 game discs were in, or worrying that I downloaded this game 2 times already and was on my last download, or that I didn't have to reinstall my operating system because Unreal 2k thought my legitimate disc was pirated and locked me out and forced me to download a pirated copy of the game to play the fucking game I fucking bought legitimately and not lock it out of windows for fucking eternity.\n\nLet's just say it didn't take long for me to see the value.\n\nYep, I was more than happy to deal with the issues of Steam after losing several CD keys or having scratched CDs making it impossible to reinstall the game and play it.   It was obvious Steam was going to be 100x better than physical media, and definitely has been.\n\nLove when installing a new computer and selecting the games I want to install and then walking away/going to bed to find them all ready to go.\n\nAs much as i love products that eliminate my need to have to think.... accidentally buying 2 copies of the same game HAS TO BE a very niche issue no? I mean for people who didnt have issues organizing games before, what other specifically \"launch-related\" features would you say make steam worth its reputation/share/power?\n\nThey were referring to DRM, not purchasing the game more than once. The disc for Spore for example would stop letting you download it anymore after a certain number of uses.\n\nAh shit yes that is a worthy distinction i didnt notice. Im out here living under a rock lol i think i just game too little on PC hehe\n\nThis. Just like how we hate every new game launcher we have now, steam was viewed the same way at the time. Crazy to think now it's the standard\n\nwe just need a launcher to launch launchers\n\nyeah thats what steam is now\n\nSteam is capable of that.\n\nSteam can launch the runescape launcher I think\n\n&gt;Just like how we hate every new game launcher we have now, steam was viewed the same way at the time.\n\nTwo major differences.\n\n1. When Steam was figuring it out, they had no one to compare themselves to or learn from.  They had to try and fail on their own.  When Ubisoft or Epic repeated Steam's own failures, that's just them not paying attention.\n\n2. Like streaming, no one wants to deal with 18 different launchers.  And like streaming, the end user is more likely to pick 2-3 primary launchers and abandon the rest, making the barrier to enter much higher today.\n\nThe other launchers are just dogshit and for that reason hated. Steam just works.\n\nFor example just the other day I wanted to end my ubisoft plus subscription and the launcher is some webshit ported to desktop. Then I needed ages to find where I can cancel just to realize I have to login again on the website and do it there.\n\nIn Steam almost everything can be done in a few actions. Even stuff like refunds.\n\nubisoft specifically is dogshit\n\nYou can still do the desktop icon thing with steam\n\nWhen it was first added, it made counter strike have worse performance, and the UI seemed like downgraded universal unskinned ugliness. It wasn't obvious at first what was actually being gained, because at first, there wasn't much being gained. As more features were added, more games, more connectivity, it made a lot more sense.\n\nWell, it was a buggy mess when it first released.\n\nIt was so annoying when CS 1.6 (or 1.5?) came out and you were forced to use steam. Like bro I already have this game why do I have to use this shitty puke green BS that can't even connect to servers right\n\nAlso, internet was slower and computers had significantly less memory than they do now.\n\nDriving to the store to buy a game was quicker and it didn't require a program running in the background.\n\nI was thinking of this the other day.  How people adore Steam,now yet back when it was being released people were the opposite.  \n\nIt was a mess and being forced to use it to play Half Life 2 ( I think?) pissed people off more.\n\nI think that is when I had to make an account.\n\nNobody adores Steam, the program. Its job is just to piss you off as little as possible when you want to launch a game. Now the Steam *store*, yes, people do like that.\n\nId definitely argue the contrary.\n\nSteam, the program, has very loud, and proud, defenders. Likewise with valve. **especially** in this, and similar subs\n\nFor good reason too. Steam was not good when it came out. And as much as I love Steam, it did start a really bad trend in some ways. I remember getting Dawn of War II on a disc and it needing both Steam and GFWL. It was an absolute joke how bad it was. What was the point of having a disc if I needed to download the whole game anyway. These days most people have adequate internet, but back then we didn't. Teenage me spending hours getting stuff to download on my 8mb connection... And not to mention how much of a buggy mess it was.\n\nLet's also not erase some of the other hurdles it took to get here. Steam support, who we now call heroes for their openness to refund consumers in the face of corrupt publishers, used to be awful. Steam support had a reputation for being one of the worst support services around. Aspects of Steam back then, before Valve became a financial powerhouse, were really not consumer friendly.\n\nSteam took a good few years to get going. My account is pretty old now, and I've seen more or less the whole journey ever since I first saw my cousin play Counter Strike. We're just lucky that Gabe and the Valve crew had a vision in mind that was good for consumers, because it could have gone very badly for us. Tim Sweeney is a massive idiot, but one thing he got right is that Valve is an effective monopoly and could be dangerous. It's just that Gabe is actually intelligent and has morals, while Tim actually did everything in his power to stop Epic from being good. I find it baffling how you could just do everything so obviously wrong...\n\nYeah, I get the feeling Tim Sweeney is just mad it's not HIS virtual monopoly and that's his real complaint...\n\nI hate to play Devil's Advocate here but he may have been genuine in his original intent, considering how he initially tried to enlist Valve on his mission against Apple and Google but they rejected him, and the discovery phase yielded an email where an exec pretty much went \"U mad bro?\" on his proposition.\n\nWhat Tim doesn't get is that that split is the reason why Valve has the means and budget to make things better for everybody while paying their own employees. The research spent on Steam Big Picture and how that ended up benefitting Linux greatly, experimenation with VR and controllers which lead to Alyx and the Index, Valve also being able to sell the Steam Deck at a loss in order to force their competitors to sell handheld gaming PCs below $700 if they want to compete with the Steam Deck, which ends up benefitting EVERYONE in the process (GPD and Aya Neo used to sell handhelds at $1.7k, literally the same price as a gaming laptop). In comparison, Sony, Nintendo and Microsoft are in the same exact position with the walled garden setups of their consoles, yet every console release has only lead them to shoot up the price every time.\n\nHis intent may have been good originally but he's either too stupid to recognize what Valve is doing with that 70/30 split, or worse, he's forcing Valve to cripple itself by making that split less.\n\nEspecially what they got right was to see piracy as a service problem. Offer a better service and people will pay. Many publishers thought pc gaming was dying back then\n\nGFWl was fucking terrible, steam was literally years ahead in terms of stability and function.\n\nI remember Steam crashing all the time, Disconnecting all the time, getting kicked mid cs match, Not being able to play without Steam when it was down. \n\nat first there were plenty of reasons to hate on steam. \n\nBut they kept working on it and it got better.\n\nIt didn't seem to have a purpose.\n\nIt was 2004, I still had dial up. I had to wait a minute or two just to see a 640x480 picture of a nipple and you expect me to download gigabytes worth of data?\n\nYep it fucking sucked and back then the majority of us were still only had dial up as a option or if you were lucky ISDN, only those living in select cities and suburbs were able to have cable\n\nI refused to touch it until 2010. It's taken a lot of control away from people. For example by Steam rules when you die your game library also dies, your kids don't get it. That's going to upset a lot of people in the future. At some point Steams also going to go offline or turn to shit under new management. \n\nDon't get me wrong it has done good things too but at some point in the future it's going to wipe out peoples libraries. That might be 1 year from now or it might be 500 years from now but it will fall and when it does lots of games are going to be lost.\n\nI was wondering why the Half-Life developer was trying to make a game store instead of just making more kickass games.\n\ni didn't have broadband when it came out\n\nYup. Steam pre-dates widespread high speed internet in the US. Of course it was an awful idea. Until the tech caught up and they were in prime position.\n\nIt was one of those ideas that was awful at the time unless you had the foresight to see that internet speeds would get faster and more stable. \n\nI feel like all the people who doubted the idea are also the same people who laughed at Netflix and bought Blockbuster stock.\n\nRedacted For Privacy Reasons\n\nI had a 2GB monthly cap when it came out. I had a physical copy of a game but had to download a 5GB update to play this game I owned. I was only ever going to play single player but I had to be connected to the internet anyway. Took me 3 months before I could play the game I bought (Shogun 2: Total War). I hated Steam with a burning passion.\n\nThankfully there were never caps in Sweden for land lines.\n\nYou had a 2gb monthly cap when shogun 2 total war came out? So, it's release date was 2011. that's like one 2 hour 1080P movie. Should you have directed your anger at steam....? or your isp?\n\nHe wouldn't have to redirect his anger toward anyone if the game's single player mode can be played without requiring an internet connection.\n\nBought L4D, took it to my grandmas house for the summer. I was so excited, only to find out I needed internet to install. 2 months staring at it, I’ve never been so fucking upset.\n\nYeah it seemed like a nice idea, but total pie in the sky when we were on dial up\n\nExactly. Steam came out at a time when broadband wasn't readily available for a LOT of people.\n\nI remember buying a game and hearing that it was also available on Steam. Cool! I don't have a great Internet connection so I won't be doing that.\n\nWhen I got my physical copy, do you know what it asked me to do? I had to install steam and download it from there. I. Was. LIVID. \n\nA game I'd be waiting for ages, got an actual PHYSICAL copy of it, and I still had to download it via Web. \n\nSteam left a very bad taste with me for years over that\n\nSame.  I was on dialup until 2006.\n\n\"It was a very weird time,\" says Gabe Newell. \"I don't think people understand how many times we would go to people and say, 'No, you will be able to distribute software over the internet' and have people say, 'No, it will never happen.' I'm not talking about one or two people. I mean like 99% of the companies we talked to said 'It will never happen. Your retail sales force will never let it happen.'\n\n\"But also people would say, 'Users aren't gonna want this... people want physical copies.' There were so many bad faith arguments that were being made. Retail sales is not the goal, right. It's actually an impediment, it's somebody who sits between you and the customer.\"\n\nAt the time, him saying all of this was ridiculous. Users DIDN'T want this.\n\nGen Alpha and younger Gen Z kids just always had good internet and Steam. When Steam launched, it was awful. You had to go online, and you'd download games at 200kb/s over several days. It was unusable if you were poor and had data caps. Most public Wifi networks were paywalled and expensive.\n\nAlso DRM is extremely normalized now (Totalbiscuit is rolling in his grave) but at the time it was expected you own your games. Steam didn't have ANY of the features it has now. You were forced to connect to the net for no reason. It screwed everyone over.\n\nBlizzard allegedly had the idea for Steam way before Valve but didn't want to pursue the marketplace idea.\n\nIt also took Valve doing the Walmart strategy to really take off. They had to deeply undercut retailers in order to draw people in. Hence why Steam sales are so famous despite being pretty milquetoast nowadays.\n\nValve just did extremely well in being ahead of the curve. PCs and internet connections got significantly better, and Valve had their marketplace coded ready. Other companies like EA were pitching their tents, while Valve was upgrading their outdoor grill and handing out burgers.\n\nNot to detract from your argument, but it's milquetoast. \n\nMilk toast is a very milquetoast breakfast option from New England.\n\nYeah I know :( I usually use the correct type of toast but I just wasn't very awake when writing it.\n\nSure, but the word is named after a character who is named after the breakfast.\n\nSteam is just a dictatorship where the current dictator is relatively good. If that ever changes things are going to be really really bad. This is why I think it's shortsighted to be so anti Epic, steam needs to have a viable competitor.\n\n[deleted]\n\nI didn't expect PC gaming of all things to be where this is tested...\n\nTo be fair, there have been lots of places, often marketplaces, where this is tested all the time.\n\nOr goes crazy.\n\nHeh... Of all things, the \"Dark Warrior Duck\" time travel episode of Dark Wing Duck came to my mind first.\n\nIt does. Platforms like Epic and GOG appearing are also what have forced Valve to drastically improve Steam already.\n\nIn polisci, I generally learned that a besign dictatorship is the best form of government, but keeping the dictator benign is the difficult challenge.\n\nSteam has prevented enshitification in its space, unlike say amazon, reddit, Google search, YouTube, etc.\n\nThat's because Steam is private compant and those other are public companies and shareholders prefer quick profits no matter what. If Steam ever goes public it will be the same as other public companies.\n\nAdd to this that the investors are often very opinionated about how this is to be achieved.\n\nSuddenly everything has to be a live service offline open world on-rails class-oriented shooter RPG, even though that niche is already completely filled by that one big example.\n\nI assume that is because investors see what a milking cow other company has made and they want one for themselves, they do not care about interesting games, only what makes the most money with as little effort as possible.\n\nI wanted to write how they don't even achieve that goal, since this \"more of the same\" strategy generally fails, *especially* for games-as-a-service, where that one big competitor doesn't just vanish.\n\nBut while writing I remembered some things about investment.\n\n- There are huge counter examples like Fortnite – meant to be an entirely different, somewhat niche game, it jumped on the band wagon of Battle Royal games reusing the mechanics originally meant for base building against zombies and has become one of the biggest games ever.\n- Investors don't care about whether an individual investment is successful. They hedge their bets, and if spoiling 99 out of 100 projects with their demands gets them a 20,000% ROI on number 100, that would be their direction.\n\nThe main thing with games is they thrive by evolving and changing. Yes you can piggyback a popular game *if you're releasing at the same time*, but investors see X do well and go \"We want the game to do X!\" even though its 2 years away, by which point Y is the new hotness.\n\nSteam aside, if Valve ever goes public I assume that's when half life 3 finally comes out, and it will be some run of the mill shooter with short campaign and a micro-transaction ridden multiplayer\n\n[deleted]\n\n&gt;  If that ever changes things are going to be really really bad\n\nNot if, but when. Newell won't be around forever and you never know who is going to take over and what their intentions will ultimately be. I'd imagine Newell will name a successor he trusts, but you never know what happens after they ultimately take the reigns. And even if their intentions remain the same, it just takes one misstep to sink a ship.\n\nEpic already is the nightmare we’re afraid that Steam might someday become.  I would simply fall back to GOG (and other methods, arr) if Steam became Epic.\n\nI am anti Epic entirely because of how they conduct themselves, if steam was the upstart with it's current Ethos and Epic was in the place Steam is I would have already moved. Steam needs to have a viable competitor, Epic isn't it from an ethos or model standpoint.\n\nTo this day I still take in and appreciate/marvel at casually achieving 500mb/s download speeds and downloading 50 gigs in like 5-10 minutes. I’m not sure kids could really grasp it today that we would need 2 or 3 days to download a movie. I remember T1 internet being like a holy grail.. 1000kb/s 😂😂 today 1000mb/s is becoming the standard. OG Steam UI was also sweet\n\nHaving to reinstall WoW was a nightmare. The game was huge.\n\nBy Wrath of the Lich King, there were like 12 install discs.  It took about 3 hours for each one. Once you were finally through them all, you had to then wait hours for it to patch...\n\nOverall it was about two days.\n\nAnd that generation of PC games was incredibly streamlined compared to the generation before it.\n\nEvery stat about early WoW sounds made up.\n\nHalf of all daily internet traffic was World of Warcraft at one point.\n\nIn the days before Youtube and streaming video, 10% of the internet's bandwidth was just people downloading the game and its patches.\n\nPlay Nice goes over some crazy Blizzard stats.\n\nStarcraft 1 was such a huge success in South Korea that they sold a copy to 1/10th of their population.\n\nWoW also overshot Blizzard's sales expectations so much that they had to scramble to deploy all of their servers and copies they had planned for the year, and it still wasn't enough.\n\nThe downfall of Blizzard was extremely sad. Peak Blizzard was such a great era culturally. Especially the early Blizzcons.\n\nExactly, when Steam came out my family had just ditched the 40kbps speeds of dial-up two years prior and was on that blazing-fast 150kbps DSL - the fastest speed offered in our area. It would have taken literal days to download a game from the internet. \n\nIt was absurd to think of Steam as a platform to distribute games at the time. Between 2004 and 2011 the only game I had on my account was Counterstrike. Then one day a friend invited me to play Team Fortress with him and his gaming buddies - it's free and on Steam, so why not? It still took me something like 5 hours to download because I had shit internet even then.\n\nFor a couple years there, it was still faster for me to physically haul my desktop computer to my college campus and download from their wifi after 5pm when everyone left campus, and then haul the computer home than it was to actually download at home.\n\nWhen Steam was released was there such a thing as data caps? Lol, I feel like Steam outdates data caps. Was cable Internet even around then? Back in 2003 it was mostly DSL at the residential level, so like 1.5Mbps max. But most people still had dial-up. Cable internet was still in its infancy and even still if you had it you didn't have much better speeds than what was available with DSL.\n\nDamn near everyone still had dial up, data caps were unthinkable. It would take me days sometimes to install games.\n\n&gt; It also took Valve doing the Walmart strategy to really take off. They had to deeply undercut retailers in order to draw people in. Hence why Steam sales are so famous despite being pretty milquetoast nowadays.\n\nMost people really don't remember the early days of Steam sales where relatively new games would be something like -90% off. And games would normally cost $49.99 and there weren't any Deluxe Editions and Season Passes, that meant that you could get a recent AAA game for $4.99 and that was a regular occurrence at these sales. Nowadays on Steam you're lucky if you can get a five-year old game at half price yet people still talk about the Steam sales like it's the most important season of the year.\n\nGood example of the argument being correct but not to the extent that it matters. Many gamers still hate digital downloads and want physical copies, but sooooo many more don’t care or actively dislike the annoyance of managing physical copies. \n\nOften people stop thinking once they think of an objection rather than asking how much that objections actually matters.\n\nNot many, the majority is increasingly only digital\n\nOn PC I’d argue the extreme majority are digital only\n\nAren't PC \"retail\" packages just a clamshell with a digital code inside?\n\nYes, because not only have most PC gamers moved on from discs to digital, but also because of limitations on the DVD format.\n\nA single-layer DVD can only hold 4.7 GB of data. A dual-layer DVD can only hold 8.5 GB. The biggest DVDs on the market are blank discs capable of up to 15.9-17 GB, but those are for storing data, not playing media off. All the while, the fastest DVD/laser combo can only read data at 21.6 MB per second.\n\nDVDs were fine as a delivery method back in the 6th gen when most games averaged only 3-7GB of total size, when systems still had under 4GB of RAM, &amp; the common storage drive could only read tens to hundreds of MB a second.\n\nUnfortunately, these days the average AAA game require 50-120 GB of storage space &amp; read/write speeds in the GB/s range. For reference, according to Sony, the PS5 requires an SSD that can sustain read speeds of 5,500 MB/s just to operate smoothly (that is to say that the PS5's OS is too demanding to run effectively off a DVD or HDD).\n\nXbox and PlayStation have managed to retain physical releases because they transitioned from DVD to Blu-ray, but most PC gamers don't have a DVD drive - much less a Blu-ray drive that costs exponentially more (DVD drives can range from $5-40, but bluray drives start at $40 and average $50-70).\n\nYup, was a sad realization on my last PC build when I opted not to have a drive.  I looked at how many years it had been since I last used it and just shrugged.\n\nKinda surprised consoles haven't gone digital-only by now.(I know there's a gradual push like PS5 Digital)\n\nI only have an internal BR drive because of my efforts to digitize my massive collection of movies &amp; games. \n\nIt's so much easier to play my old console games with a modern wireless controller &amp; emulators through Playnite than it ever was to have to sort through the discs and change them between games.\n\nHonestly, it's mostly just holdouts from the Gen X and [my fellow] Millennial generation who don't want to let go of holding a physical disc even though the rest of the world has started moving on since we discovered MP3 players &amp; iPods, or subsequently were raised in the era of smartphones being a disposable commondity.\n\nPeople aren't even putting CD drives into their PCs these days lol. That's ancient technology.\n\nThere's still a few tasks where having a physical copy is useful, such as installing an operating system on a brand new PC, but we aren't using CDs anymore for that. We're using USB thumb drives. USB ports are just a better version of a CD drive because it can be used for multiple accessories (e.g. keyboards, mice, jump drives), not just one.\n\nNowadays I think so\n\nThe many in this case is absolutely a minority.\n\nIt's weird because it depends. With a trusted platform like Steam, I love having a digital library. I know I'll have those games until the end of time, no matter how often my computer changes. That means I don't need a physical copy.\n\nBut if it's a platform where there's no trust that I will still have my game in 3 years, I want a physical copy that does not require an Internet connection.\n\n&gt; actively dislike the annoyance of managing physical copies. \n\nI love physical media and wish it wouldn't go away, but even I had to admit that it's not practical after a certain point.\n\nSure, if you're only buying/playing one game a year it's not much of an inconvenience, but I had 400+ discs across the first four PlayStation generations before I finally gave up trying to find a way to store them all &amp; transitioned to PC for digital-only purchases.\n\nIt's nice, in theory, to have physical copies of all of your games, but once you get multiple generations in and have a collection in the triple digits, it's more of a burden than a benefit to have them all on individual discs in individual cases. The cases take up *way* too much space in the long run, and even the biggest CD cases are only really effective up until you hit like 120 discs - then they start bulging at the seams or require 20+ minutes sorting through them just to find something interesting to play.\n\nAlso I'll be honest, I do not miss the constant fear of scratching the disk.\n\nMe neither, but that fear mostly went away for me when Sony transitioned to Blu-Ray. Those discs are hearty af and can go through a lot of abuse before they stop reading.\n\nI remember testing the myths of the durability of PS3 games with an ex's copy of Oblivion. \n\nFirst we took a fork to the back &amp; made shallow scratches. No effect.\n\nThen we took a steak knife and cut deeper scratches. Still read the disc anyway.\n\nThen we took steel wool to it &amp; made it look like countless PS1 and PS2 discs that didn't read anymore and it *still* successfully installed &amp; ran the game.\n\nEventually we got fed up and smacked it with a machete. That did the job.\n\nI have since replaced my entire 600+ disc movie collection with Blurays where available, but have also taken to ripping them to a NAS drive and storing them safely in a box out of the way.\n\n“Many” = a small vocal group on Reddit\n\nI greatly miss the days of retail copies of games.  Where you owned that copy and didn’t need any internet to play it.  Hell, often the game was fully complete and working right out of the box.  Also the boxes were size of cereal boxes to contain all the swag that used to be included with games.  Good times.\n\nTo be fair the first versions of Steam were absolute shit.\n\nValve did what no other video executives ever wants to do: listen to critiscim and improve.\n\nEmphasis on the improve. So many companies update simply for the sake of updating so employees can justify their job, and they end up completely ruining the product or service. It becomes bloated, ugly, and buggy. What used to take 2 clicks now takes 8.\n\nValve, on the other hand, go out of their way to try and make the absolute best version possible of everything they implement. They really pour their hearts and souls into all of their projects and try hard to ensure every update is a progression. Things actually get better instead of more complicated. They are legitimately a groundbreaking company.\n\nA game i play did a fucking dumb change like that somewhat recently.\n\nTo full mute a player now you have to take 2 actions instead of just hover and click mute.\n\nLike what the fuck man, minor thing but fucking annoying.\n\nEven Microsoft is doing this with Windows. Now I have to click \"more options\" to access the shit I've always had immediate access to since the very first time I used a computer decades ago. And of course there's no setting to customize this. Just fuck you if your workflow depends on a specific right click action. \n\nI genuinely don't understand the obsession with dumbing everything down as much as possible, while in the same breath making it more complex. Nobody asked for this.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/exf5j65\n\n[bruh](https://i.imgur.com/eMoEqUx.gif)\n\nIt took them around a decade to turn it into a good and consumer friendly platform.\n\nMost people \"remember\" only the last 10 years.\n\nI remember everything....\n\nDon't be ridiculous, they got better way faster than 10 years.\n\nI'm not sure how vocal I was about digital distribution, but I do know I bought Half-Life 2: Silver. That was the deluxe release on Steam, with no physical component. I think that made me an early adopter of digital delivery. \n\nAlways believed it would work, always figured the positives far outweighed the negatives.\n\n&gt; Always believed it would work, always figured the positives far outweighed the negatives.\n\nSame here! I used to live somewhere with no stores where we could buy PC games. Steam was a game changer, hours of downloading HL2 beat having to wait more than a week for an online international order to come in.\n\n&gt;Always believed it would work, always figured the positives far outweighed the negatives.\n\nWow, an actual outlier.\n\nOkay, I do have to agree in some form. Maybe not economically, as I don't have knowledge there, but on a personal level.\n\nThe idea of buying games on a platform was so new to me, so when I first saw Steam when I wanted to play RUSE, I disregarded Steam as a scam/illegal distribution site. \n\nNow Steam and GOG are the only places I buy games at all, if I am not forced to a different platform. What a transformation!\n\nRUSE…such an underrated and amazing game. First time in over a decade I’ve seen someone mention it.\n\nBack when steam launched I wouldn't have wanted digital-only games. \n\nI had 1mb/s down and 100kb/s up internet\n\nNow i have 1GB/s down and 100mb/s up. \n\nTime makes a huge difference\n\n[deleted]\n\nHow long would a game from that era take to download? Like HL2 or something?\n\nLiteral days. I had 56k when HL2 came out. Back then they still sold a physical copy comprising of I believe 5 cd roms. I got it for Christmas, I was so excited for it.\n\nEven just activating and patching the game took a few hours. If I had to download 5 CDs worth of data (around 3-4GB), it would have taken literal days with my internet running 24/7, which wasn’t possible. I remember trying to download a Linux ISO when my family went camping. I left the internet and download running while we were gone for like 5 days, and that just one CD ISO worth of data. \n\nWe eventually got 1mb bandwidth which was glorious in comparison but even that would have taken about 8 hours fully saturating the connection to download 3.5 gb. \n\nDang, y'all really did have to hike uphill both ways.\n\nLmfao \n\n1 mb/s was incredible back then...\n\nI was one of them but THEN.....this happened:  \nOrdered Fallout 4 online, from the same shop as usual...on disc. While I was at work, they tried to deliver...wasn't at home, so it ended up at the post office. Next day, rainy friday, took a day off, I went there....forgot they take a 2 hour break from 1pm to 3....so back home....in the rain. Had to go there again, still raining. And while I was standing out there in the rain, because the place was PACKED with people -.- I said to myself \"next time, you buy it on steam, install, play\". Because I saw my alternative-universe-Me sitting at home, dry, happy, playing, while I was dripping wet and pissed.\n\nYou open the box and see no disk, but an install code.\n\nBack then you had at least 50% of the game on disc, then it was just a link on a disc it seemed like.\n\nI know Fallout 4 came out like 10 years ago, but Steam had already been a successful thing for like 10 years by Fallout 4's release, and you were still doubting it?\n\nDamn, I was gonna say, \"yeah, Fallout 4 just came out,\" but 10 years? Damn. I just realized it's not even the most recent Fallout game. Damn...\n\nYes I watched the Half Life 2 documentary. And so should you. I'm fucking tired of seeing these tidbits split into 'articles' and 'news' every day. Do you know why they didn't make episode 3? Do you know how they won the Vivendi case ? Do you know why Gman stutters when he talks? Go watch that doc, it's really good, geez. \n\nAlso. OP is a bot\n\nYeah this documentary is really sustaining games journalism this month\n\nYouTube keeps recommending “reactions” and “breakdowns” and “analyses” of the documentary. Web sites and blogs are going through it with a fine-toothed comb for “news” and “articles.” God, I hate modern Internet “content.”\n\nI mean, if they hadn't made it a requirement for playing HL2, it would have utterly failed.\n\nSmart of them to bundle the service with a killer app.\n\nYeah, people have memory holed early download services like Direct2Drive.\n\nSteam wasn't first by a long shot. It got market dominance by forcing install to play half-life 2. \n\nAnd then achieved infamy by crashing for the first month of the games release to the point where plenty of gamers I knew wrote off steam as a scam for years.\n\nI know steam was hated at first but people also romanticized how damn messy PC gaming was at the time. I became a believer when a game I had was patched on its own and it just worked which obviously nowadays sounds insane, we expect that bare minimum, but back then that was not easy. \n\nYou either had to brave file sites and pray that all you got was the patch and nothing else or the game had its own patcher and if it didn't work for whatever reason you were SOL. I had several games that refused to patch for months for no reason I could see and I was stuck with very buggy (or outright busted) games.\n\nLol yeah we take it for granted now lol, it was a hassle process back in the days.\n\nCheck games forums &gt; check comments are mostly positive &gt; download and install&gt; and pray 🙏\n\nI’m old enough to remember being sent a patch in the post on a 3.5 inch floppy.\n\nOh yeah I was there. When the ancient texts were written. Everyone was scathing about the idea of a digital storefront. People hated the concept.\n\nI remember being pretty anti-steam to start with. I didn’t like the idea of having a separate launcher, it wasn’t until I changed computers once and I didn’t have to find all my cd’s and product keys and the first big sales that I started to appreciate it.\n\n the only ray of hope in these dark times. Bless you Gaben\n\nI got Steam back in 2006, purely so I could play Counter Strike: Source with a friend from school. It took 3 days to download, since in those days, living in in rural Lancashire, my Internet was painfully slow, and I would constantly get kicked from servers for having high ping. Naturally I stuck with physical media where possible, the only games I got on Steam for a long time were Valve games you couldn't play without Steam.\n\nNowadays I can't imagine gaming without it. It really was ahead of its time, a piece of software for the high speed broadband age being released at a time many people had to make do with a painfully slow, unstable Internet connection.\n\nOk, well 99% of people also think you'll never make half-life 3.\n\n\\* Crosses fingers and waits for him to prove us wrong \\*\n\nI take it this documentary will be shared to reddit one sentence at a time.\n\nAs I recall it was The Orange Box which really seales the deal for Steam. And it was, unexpectedly, Portal which sealed the deal for The Orange Box. Portal was included as a kind of tech demo, hence not being sold stand-alone. (I don't think it was ever sold on its own in-store.) And yet... I think without Portal there'd be no Steam. That should easily make it to the top 5 most influential video games ever sold.\n\nSo is the new topic that’s gonna keep being reported for the next week?\n\nIt was referred to as \"Steamin' pile o' crap\" when it first launched\n\nIs steam basically THE biggest factor in the downfall of disc drives for PCs?  I understand tons of software was sold via disc, not just games. But Steam showing the capability of digital distribution had to be a huge factor in major companies like Microsoft switching as well.    \n  \nOr are things like portable USB drives a much bigger factor?\n\nThe capacities didn't keep up. When USB drives could store more, no one cared about discs. When internet got fast, also. When smartphone storage for huge a long time ago I dropped USB drives. These days with fast internet and cloud storage you don't even need anything.\n\nIt's not Steam, it's faster internet. Faster internet made Steam good."

Ever since he expanded into the multi-person format, I don't like it as much anymore.\n\nCuriously, his videos mostly vanished from the algorithm too... No idea why *that* is. \n\nThat aside, also Physicist. So that particular video was more of a \"WHY DIDN'T I THINK OF THAT??\" moment.\n\nGotta love gaming logic where that is a sword lol\n\nCould just put the wood beam stopper across the gap and walk it\n\nIt’s like in Fallout when a door is 99% destroyed and barely hanging on, but it’s locked, so you can’t go through it. Even though more than half the door isn’t there.\n\nMax strength, rocket-powered two-handed hammer means nothing to a 100+ year old door.\n\nWhen an unstoppable force meets an immovable object\n\n[The Stoppable Force](https://www.wowhead.com/item=25402/the-stoppable-force)\n\n[The Movable Object](https://www.wowhead.com/tbc/item=25407/the-movable-object)\n\nWhen a stoppable force doesn't hit a movable object\n\nitem level 69 https://y.yarn.co/c50afde2-08a4-4d89-87b8-24860efe5f84_text.gif\n\nWow had so much life in it's design back then\n\nI even specifically remember looting that item from some random mob in STV just from how it stood out to me lol.  Everyone was discussing how Michael Jackson had just passed away.  \n\n\nFunny how stuff sticks in your mind like that.  But there was a lot of memorable stuff from wow before you got to the 35th expansion or whatever.\n\nPTSD from PvP server STV\n\nI was one of those rogues\n\nDid somebody say [[Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker]](https://www.wowhead.com/item=19019/thunderfury-blessed-blade-of-the-windseeker)?\n\nThis is a huge issue with Bethesda RPGs. \n\nYou can't actually play to your character.  \n\nStrength should,  in some situations, be an alternative to lockpicking. Same with spellcasting in Elder Scrolls. Removing the Unlock spell reduced the roleplaying ability of the game.\n\nYou should be able to force open  a chest, but then risk damaging the contents. \n\nedit: This is possible in nethack I believe.\n\nI can kind of see this, but then I think \"how much accuracy is enough?\".\n\nLike, if I'm using a small hammer to smash a padlock off, I would only risk damaging the most delicate things, like potions in glass vials.\n\nIf I used a sledge hammer to destroy the chest, and wasn't particularly careful with how I did it, maybe I could chip or break a sword, dent armor, MAYBE rip some cloth armor or something, but almost no amount of smashing should ruin a pair of cloth boots.\n\nSo, do I make a chart for every item in the game and compare it to the risk level of HOW I'm smashing it open? Do I consider the size of the object vs the size of the chest? Do I add durability to a flask if it's wrapped in cloth, or even just laid on top of some cloth armor? If not, aren't I just swapping one level of lack of realism for another?\n\nAiming to break the lock is one thing to do, for sure.  But why wouldn't weaponry, even significantly magical, be able to slice through or snap the hinges?  Surely there's enough points of weakness for a chest that a lock, no matter how intricate, is simply no match for a crowbar and a working knowledge of leverage.\n\nThere's a book that pops up in Elder Scroll games that mention that. The author notes finding chests with strong locks, but the chest is weak so the lock is still intact, but the rest of the chest is broken open.\n\nThat would depend on the strength of the overall materials used, strength of the tools, and time. If the owner didn't care about the contents, the container would be made of rotten wood and rusty iron nails which would be easy to pop open. If the owner went with the strongest available materials and/or enchantments, you will need tools and/or spells that are at least as strong or risk damaging your tools and the contents. Then we need to factor in how much time you want to spend on opening the container. More time usually means less force and it doesn't guarantee you can find a weakness to exploit so you can open the container with lesser tools.\n\nThey should make it where if you lockpick it's undetectable. If you hulk smash they'll investigate and aggro\n\nYeah just pry it open, or like use a sword to cut the wood in chunks lol.  Pry open the lock, I mean a master lock model 1440 can be opened with another master lock model 1440 and I'm sure the locks weren't nearly as good back then lol.\n\nAfter \"Mimic Mania\" in which thousands of innocent chests were needlessly destroyed, much of the world's chest-makers unionised.\n\nIn deference to how long it takes to craft a quality chest, anyone caught needlessly damaging a chest is immediately disbarred from ever purchasing a chest ever again.\n\nThat is the delicate balance of game design. You want a realistic game, but how realistic do you make it? Do you want it to be fun for casual people, or be more unforgiven. What level of tedium do you want? Are you going to go mainly off your personal artistic/creative direction or do you want to try and make a mass appeal game?\n\nHow much money, time, and effort do you have to sink into this? Every extra “realistic” feature is that much more money, time, effort, and risk.\n\nwell, baldurs gate 3 did it just fine and i'd say it was much more fun because of it\n\nIf you're going in from the start intending to simulate that items could just have some sort of fragility stat and modifiers to that based on packing method, fullness of the chest, etc, and then you just make a handler function or class that manages all this and can be tweaked on its own, but only like really silly hyper simulationist roguelikes where \"doing an entirely silly level of detail for a funny little game conveyed only through an interface that would have been considered janky and outdated 30 years ago\" is their whole identity would bother. Because that whole vibe is done through little subsystems like that which are both absurdly complex but also pretty self-contained and relatively easy to implement for a programmer who doesn't have to sell several managers on why they should spend hundreds of hours of labor making this silly little system work and then implement it with a ton of oversight.\n\nI love it! In fact, forget the rest of the game. We're just gonna make Chest Opening Simulator a new genre! -Some Indie Dev Probably\n\nCongratulations, you just designed Baggage Handler Simulator 2024, with the TSA DLC.\n\nGive Dwarf Fortress another 10 years and that is what it will be.\n\nalso triggering traps as well at least with finesse lockpicking you'll have the option to disarm the trap. so yea it is a good compromise.\n\n7 days to die does this. Loot value is reduced if you smash open a locked chest instead of picking it.\n\nBaldurs gate 3 did it right, can't lockpick then just use your 2 handed ax and beat the door/chest down\n\n2 handed axe? I'm a monk ill punch and kick till it opens.\n\nConvert the chest and now it will open out of friendliness.\n\nThis was the case in divinity 1 and 2 as well\n\nUltima Underworld (the granddaddy of all 3D open-world RPGs) allowed for that back in 1991. Nearly every door can be bashed down, if you've got enough spare weapons to do so. IIRC there was even one door near the starting area that deliberately did not have a key, so players might discover that doors are destructable.\n\nIn Neverwinter Nights you could just repeatedly cast area of effect spells like fireball and then loot everything from the floor, no need to lockpick or smash every chest individually.\n\none issue is that getting into locked doors and boxes is an absolute fuckton easier in real life than video games imply. And its purely because of the mechanical value of getting into these places. The result is the other stupid trope, being good at lockpicking costing the same resources as being equally good at all fields of biology, chemistry, computer programming, and physics at the same time.\n\nBethesda games went more dumbed down with each installment.\n\nYep. You actually *could* bash doors down in Daggerfall.\n\nYou could do a lot of things in Daggerfall that didn't even make it into Morrowind, let alone the later installments. You could climb literally anything, even a sheer wall (provided your Climbing skill was high enough). Most creatures had their own languages you could learn individually as a skill so you talk to them instead of fighting. You could buy a whole ship and become a pirate. There was an entire banking system, including loans. Quests had actual time limits in terms of days, weeks, or even months you had to complete them in. No game after it had anywhere near as many weapon and armour classes, skills, magic schools, etc.\n\nGranted it was mostly procedurally generated outside of towns and cities and the dungeons were a complicated mess, but the freedom was unmatched. Plus Daggerfall Unity fixes a lot of the more poorly aged features and has plenty of QOL improvements and customisation options.\n\nThe piracy and language things were more planned features than actual features, but there's remnants of them in that you can buy a ship (which lets you speed up fast travel along the coast) and that the language skills exist and provide a chance of the monsters that speak them choosing not to attack you unless you attack first. \n\n\nWhich is Daggerfall in a nutshell. They really did bite off more than they could chew with that one, and Morrowind was scaled back to make sure they actually finished it, unlike later games that were progressively scaled back to make them more accessible for people who don't like RPGs.\n\nI loved the Morrowind magic system where you could customize and combine your spells. Adjust the radius, intensity, etc. Make different spells for different enemies like blinding them and burning them over time. Them not including that feature going forward always felt like a huge lost opportunity to me.\n\nIt felt like they were taking the players for inept morons the more they went. Everything needed to be very simple, it seems.\n\nThe Morrowind spell crafting was amazing, spent so many hrs tinkering with it. The enchantment system was similar. Used to create my own cursed high quality armor/cloaks that when you put them on would kill you from poison damage and then pickpocket an NPC and give them the gear. Just wait for them to equip it and die then I can safely loot the corpse without being caught for pickpocketing.\n\nThey did that in Daggerfall\n\nThe sad thing is that you *could* do this sort of thing in the original *Wasteland* from 1988, that Fallout is ultimately based on.\n\nLocked door?  You can pick it, sure - but you can also use strength, an axe, TNT, a rocket launcher - pretty much anything that makes sense, you can do.\n\nUp until recently I don't think destructible objects were really a thing in the Creation engine, apart from vehicles. In order to give something health it had to be classified as a creature or npc. Mods would implement a version of what you're suggesting by doing it through changed actor states and pop-up prompts, rather than you actually hitting the chest to visually break it open. Or by having a script run on chests to track if you hit them with a weapon, but that has performance impacts. \n\n\n\n\nBethesda does need to really lean back in to the RPG aspects of the games, but they've abandoned some of the obscure elements like these alternative solutions to problems outside of dialogue or menu prompts. All in favor of widened appeal, but BG3 is new proof that deep RPG mechanics can have mass appeal. \n\nHero’s Quest/Quest for Glory worked like this in 1989. Get your shit together, Bethesda.\n\nCan do that in Fallout 1 and 2 but you try it in safes and nothing will be left to loot lol\n\nSame in AC Valhalla, I have Thor's Hammer, I have the Excalibur, Im wearing Thor's armor, still I cant put down a wooden door that is barred by a wooden bar and lock\n\nThats what I loved about daggerfall. Locked door in a dungeon but you're a mindless barbarian with no time for lockpicks? smash it down!\n\nSee? Why couldn’t they do that in their modern games? Or when you’re in the dc ruins and there’s just a pile of rubble in the way. Like I get it’s limitations with the engine and stuff but cmon, my guy who has battled super mutants the size of buildings can’t climb a pile of rubble??\n\nIt’s not limitations with the engine. It’s game design. Visually lazy game design, yeah, but if you can’t cross something it’s because the devs don’t want you to cross it, not because they can’t figure out how to make it happen.\n\nSame in Arcanum. Just bash the locked doors in the dungeons.\n\nThats the nice thing about 7 days to die. Literally everything can be destroyed if you smash it long enough.\n\n[deleted]\n\nI just made my character green and maxed his sledgehammer and yelled SMASH SMASH SMASH.\n\ngiggity\n\nThere's a specific door in Fallout 76 that you have to pick. But if you walk around the building, the entire back wall is gone so you can just walk in. 😂😂\n\nShit man, I think there’s a door like that in Fallout 3 &amp; 4.\n\nPlaying through FO3/FNV via TTW. Came across a very hard (lockpick 100) door in the Museum of History. Next door down was wide open. Theres a hole blown in the connecting wall.\n\n4 has one like that on one of the cabins at Sunshine Tidings, if I remember correctly.\n\nJust saw a fo4 mod to let you break doors the other day. Considering it.\n\n[Remnant 2's impassable door.](https://imgur.com/gallery/5HkbA15)\n\nSkinny sort required ahead.\n\nAs if you can’t just reach around and unlock the thing either way, this is definitely a good example\n\nhttps://youtu.be/0Yh80SvW9mo?si=-6yna42K-R9oVtOh\n\nFallout isn't the worst with locked doors. For one thing, it doesn't have the system newer games do where lockpicks are consumable and even opening a low-level door with a high lockpick skill will destroy several of them. For another thing, if you fail the skill check, there's always [dynamite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZQBQ_JT64)\n\n[Divinity: Original Sin acknowledge that early on the game, you find a chest that is placed beyond a piece of rope that is literally a foot high, and your characters are unable to jump over.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XofIODizzS4)\n\nEspecially with the other character carrying a fucking torch.\n\n[removed]\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/qPqvpYj.png\n\nThat would not be polite.\n\nThis is absolutely hilarious\n\n[The path is blocked by a fallen tree.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Yh80SvW9mo)\n\nDOS 1&amp;2 are just *muah*\n\nAgreed. \n\nBG3 is great, but I just love the battle mechanics DoS2. I think DoS2 is a better game because it's not forced to use classic D&amp;D mechanics. Larian was free to improve upon classic D&amp;D, and they did.\n\nI didn't like AP being for both movement and actions. But that's about my only complaint.\n\nIm not a fan of the seperate physical and magical armor. It kinda forces you to play either an all physical or all magic group...\n\nIn fact yes, this is by far the worst part of the game.\n\nMy only “issue” with DOS2 is that every battlefield just ends up a clusterfuck of different terrain effects. It makes it fun and intense but sometimes it’s downright annoying lol. I still love that game with a passion. Teleporting an enemy 3 feet past a ledge to watch them fall like Wile E Coyote is 😙🤌🏻\n\nTo each his own. To me the whole \"cover the entire battlefield with effects\" is way too big a staple in DoS. It's present to a degree in BG3 but it seems to be like the bread and butter of DoS. Kills my ability to suspend disbelief and enjoy the story.\n\nSo does stealing every explosive in BG3 to crash your computer one-shotting a boss, but that's far more optional than covering every battlefield with ugly stuff is in DoS.\n\nTo each their own.  I absolutely despised the ground effects in combat and wasn't a fan of magical vs physical armor.  On the other hand I never got tired of the BG3 combat.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBU1yGF-GMg\n\nI thought it was gonna be this. Not really the same without the zoomout reveal. https://i.cbc.ca/1.3173445.1438223040!/fileImage/httpImage/winnipeg-blue-bombers.jpg\n\nMore people need to know about Larian's greatness...\n\nThe Fable games are terrible for this. Especially fable 3\n\nSame for the Dark Souls series. Your character can slay demigods, but can't climb a knee-high ledge or step over a small pile of rubble. It took until Elden Ring for your character to learn jumping up.\n\nWell you were already able to jump. It’s more like the character learning how to jump like a normal human.\n\nI'm studying to become video game programmer rn. I promise I'll do the exact same setup in one of my future projects and let you go over the barrier just to let u die the moment you jump across and the bridge collapses. You have my word.\n\nDo what the Family Guy video game did and have a mime actively creating an invisible wall to prevent you from passing.\n\nPokémon did it…\n\nThere was a, um, power outage!  Yeah!  A power outage which prevented them from being able to let you through.\n\n\"We dont have a reason for blocking you. We just like standing here\"\n\nBut... aren't the lights on right behind you?\n\nPower. Outage. Move along!\n\ndidnt the simpsons game do it as well?\n\nI would love to find a game with a similar situation, then the NPCs say \"shit, we can't go there, let's do this quest objective to advance\", but you actually can cross, so:\n\n- some players won't even try believing in the clichê\n\n- the ones who just go and cross have the NPCs in shock like \"how did you do that?\"\n\nBorderlands does that! I don't remember which one though. \n\nThere's a mission where Claptrap tells you to \"just walk through the electric barrier, it's totally safe\" \n\nThe mission reads \"walk through the electric barrier, it's totally safe\"\n\nIf you try to it fries you\n\nIf you shoot the electric box the mission changes to \"It probably wasn't good call\"\n\nBorderlands 2, the mission calls for you to shoot through the electric fence to hit the fuse box, but only after telling you through example: run through the fence, fucking do it, we dare you. \n\nIt doesn't kill you if you don't stand in it, but you cannot pass it, and it fries your shield. There are many red chests (solid loot) throughout the game hidden behind electric fences that require similar shit, following wires to find the fuse box.\n\nNo wonder I only vaguely remember it, it was like ten years ago, damn time flies\n\nI recently did 2.5 playthroughs, so I repeated that mission a couple times in the last couple months.\n\nyou might have missed the point where he says the bridge collapses\n\nAnd the part where they *fucking die* lol\n\nThat should happen *after* the npc says “How did you do that?”.\n\nPeak game design\n\nThere should be an auto save beforehand mid-dialogue so that it literally spawns you into the middle of a conversation with an NPC telling you not to say that. \n\nThe localizers will hate you, but it will be funny.\n\nI feel like they were just riffing off it with their own slightly different idea, you know, like a conversation\n\nwhat the heck is a conversation?\n\nYou may have missed the part where they said \"with a SIMILAR situation\" not \"the exact same\" situations.\n\npokemon black/white is an inspiration for its mindset of \"yeah, you aren't supposed to be in this area yet. go fuck yourself. there's a power outage or dancing practice or some shit, who cares.\"\n\nA video game programming nurse?! That’s amazing!!\n\nThat’s the right way to do it\n\nIt's German logic\n\n\"The barrier is up, I cannot cross the bridge\"\n\n\"Sure you can\"\n\n\"The barrier is up, I cannot\"\n\n\"But you can jump it\"\n\n\"The barrier is up! I cannot!\"\n\nIt's forbidden to break the law.\n\nDamn those law abiding citizens!\n\nThis was France's issue in 1940. They assumed the Meuse river would be a natural barrier but in reality they needed to put out some wooden blockades and signage saying \"DO NOT CROSS.\"\n\nor at least an arrow pointing right so all the Germans would have ended up in the Netherlands.\n\nBelgium goes forgotten again\n\n[Red goer, dead goer.](https://youtube.com/shorts/xNCeG8sO-bQ?si=FP36qJQ6GnaBsA0X)\n\n\"Set a better example mate\"\n\n\\*core memory created\\*... nie wieder\n\nWe’ve got to give Han more time!\n\nTo be fair, nothing good ever came from Germans crossing barriers.\n\nThe fall of the wall? David Hasselhoff wouldn't agree.\n\n[y’all have forgotten.](https://imgur.com/a/JWJBGg8)\n\nisn't the joke there that the door was locked but when you try to open it the wall collapses and you jump through?  It's been a while since I played Max Payne though.\n\nThat's exactly what happens lol\n\nMy favorite was not being able to open a small wooden door in MUA when my team consisted of: Wolverine, The Human Torch, Hulk, and The Thing.\n\nOne of those is tactically redundant.\n\nHey if you have a huge guy already might aswell have two huge guys\n\nI don’t want to know what the fuck those 4 are needed to fight. Doomsday from DC?\n\nMostly doombots\n\nMUA?\n\nMarvel: Ultimate Alliance\n\nHonestly of all the possible examples of this across gaming history, this one is maybe the lease egregious. \n\nI wouldn't look at that bridge and think it's safe to cross, and even if I was able to jump that gap I wouldn't trust it not to collapse when I landed.\n\nThe most egregious ever was the Pokemon power \"outage\": https://i.imgur.com/ORNENWi.png\n\nBoooo, lame. They should've just done what they did in Gen 5 and just have a bunch of fat guys randomly blocking the path ahead, at least that was funny.\n\nOr have again a sleeping Snorlax blocking the path\n\nNothing will ever beat Ds2 [pile of rubble](https://i.redd.it/mrglll8w25db1.jpg). That one is especially bad because that bit of rubble causes the protagonist to beat 4 old ones and traverse the lands. It's just so fucking silly.\n\nYou don't have to jump thr gap though, just walk across the right edge where it's mostly all there. It looks really sturdy\n\nThat’s not a bridge. That’s termites holding hands!\n\nIt’s pretty realistic. IRL, if someone fell trying to cross, they would shut it down. Spoiling the fun for everyone else. We have lost some fun things this way. Lawn darts, clackers, glass blowing kits, etc.\n\nI have 4 total packages, still sealed, of Lawn Darts. Found them in an online auction. I'll give you one bro\n\nWholesome-RimjobSteve moment\n\nNow I’m just going to assume the early version of the game let people cross the bridge until one of the beta-testers fell down.\n\nIn my home town kids refused to stop crossing this like 150 year old railroad bridge that got used like once every couple of years for reasons I don’t know.\n\nSo they built a walking bridge underneath it and connected the bike trails on both sides of the river.\n\nWe had an old train trestle. What the city did was attach some standing beams, then a thick, wide layer of plywood to those.\n\nIt's realistic in that they blocked it. It's unrealistic in that two saw horses and a beam do not an impassable barrier make. I'm pretty sure they could just shimmy along one side there and make it across.\n\nNow if the bridge were to collapse and kill everyone, well... that's on them for trying to cross the closed bridge.\n\nFF7 Remake did this, too - Cloud's stuck in Hojo's lab? He tries to cut through a security door and his sword bounces off. He's fighting Sephiroph at the end of the game? He cuts through entire buildings with a slash. JRPG logic goes brrrrr.\n\nI mean ehhhhhh you can at least justify it with that the levels actually MEAN something. It's actually a major part of the story that at the start Cloud isn't as strong as he thinks he is but by the end he's genuinely able to match up against the God-like Sephiroth. \n\nIf anything it's way worse when a JRPG acts like the characters have been just as strong at the start of the game as they are at the end - like in that case, what the fuck was the point of all that grinding I did???\n\nTwo words: Limit Break\n\nSince when is the buster sword in xvi? I only played it once at launch\n\nYou get it if you buy one of the dlcs. It's the same stats as the free onion sword so it's effectively just a cosmetic\n\nPeople who try stuff like that irl are the ones you read about in the news who died in a bridge collapse. The structure is compromised. \n\nThere are way better examples of this stuff in games, because some do it pretty badly lmao.\n\nI mean while true to an extent, we're talking about characters that could probably clear most if not all of that bridge in one jump\n\nThey're also almost never allowed to be themselves in the actual free roam. \n\nKiryu used to have trouble stepping on/off a curb in the Yakuzas. Not just into the road and outside of the play area, but he was literally not able to walk over small curbs lol\n\nOr even \"The Long Dark\" which just makes the gap to big to hop. There's no jump, but you can do a bit of air carry if you have velocity, or the gap is small and the other side is lower.\n\nThe same game doesn’t allow you to walk past chairs bc the chairs are fixed to the ground and it’s against the law to step over them.\n\nThe super limited mobility of FF games while not in combat really kill the fun for me unfortunately.\n\nI hear you but I’m not walking on that. Are you kidding?\n\nIt's almost as if we forget the knee high walls of the olden' days without a climb/jump button.\n\nYou are assuming their is no underling structural damage that could be worsened by jumping on it.\n\nSure, it's probably dangerous... But this is also final fantasy were character can survive stuff like getting hit by a meteor as long as they're not scripted to die.\n\nYou could walk along the railing instead of jumping though.\n\njust don't go all shocked Pikachu face when it naturally falls out from under you because the last thing that railing is at this point is structurally sound and able to carry the weight of a full grown person and whatever the fuck the gigantic hunk of sheer metal called the buster sword weighs\n\nIt's a raggedy old, broken wooden bridge suspended over a cliff.\n\nWould you balance yourself on a wooden beam railing with no support above a drop that means instant death? Like would you confidently hang your entire body weight on that single wooden railing, on the broken section of a bridge while you move and shuffle along it?\n\nEdit: Also don't forget, Clive is a 5'10-6'1 muscular man wearing bulky armor with heavy weapons strapped to his back.\n\n[removed]\n\nIf I saw that is real life I'm not crossing.\n\nFor me it’s FromSoft and little wooden doors that “don’t open from this side”. Bitch I have a 300lb hammer and armor made of dragon scales this door is opening from any side\n\nIt's called Giant Crusher, not Door Crusher lol\n\nGod of War has entered the chat\n\n\"Joshua\" - Clive probably\n\nIn old *Resident Evil* games, locked wooden doors can send you backtracking for twenty minutes to find some red jewel or hand crank or creepy statue.\n\n\nMost of these people are cops. \n\nI mean, IRL i wouldn't dare to jump that too\n\nTo qoute a random post I saw some time ago  \n\"Sometimes I get annoyed when I can't jump in a video game. Then I start thinking, when was the last time I jumped?\"\n\nGotta love the old resident evil games too for having crusty wooden doors that’s impassable due to being locked. Damnit Chris you have a shotgun just use it!\n\n(I completely understand it from a game design perspective and I love the old RE games)\n\nThen Chris work out, got jacked as shit and still could not break down doors in a falling apart village lol\n\nI love RE too\n\n[Viva La Dirt League](https://youtu.be/0Yh80SvW9mo?si=QWYj7hTV1XwRx4Nq)\n\n\"Damn that looks like a cool room I could loot\"\n\nSmall couch sitting sideways in the corridor: oh no I don't think you will\n\nI ran up the side of a mountain with no shoes and 65 Elk pelts. I cannot climb over this couch.\n\nFor one moment I thought this was the bridge you blew up in Red Dead Redemption 2.\n\nBro there's an old game where you can't get through a door because it's locked but despite the fact that the door itself looks like it's being held together by hopes and dreams there is a FUCK OFF GIANT HOLE in the wall not less than 1 foot to the left of it.\n\nSounds like the locked fallout doors\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBU1yGF-GMg\n\nThat bridge does not look up to code. Trust me, I'm OSHA.\n\n[removed]\n\nTo be fair in real life even if there's a comparatively small hole then crossing that bridge is very dangerous and risky. The mere existence of the hole means that the whole bridge's structural integrity is compromised.\n\nMay I introduce you to our impassable friend, wooden fence\n\n...in a game where characters usually jump 10 meters (and stay in the air for several seconds) to attack aerial targets during battles.\n\ni think the biggest let down in a lot of modern games is their overworld and traversal design. we are playing superhuman mega soldiers, capable of blasting dragons with out 50kg swords through buildings but as soon as the fight is over, we are pushing boxes to reach 2m high places, are climbing like were nathan drake in uncharted 1 and cannot cross 3m wide gaps..\n\nFF 16, FF7 remake/rebirth, stellar blade are all guilty of this.. and its fucking annoying. these games are all great but the devs did not put time or thought behind how to traverse/limit the overworld in a way that makes sense"

    "all_comment_text": "This has Sony E3 2006 written all over it.\n\nIt's RIIIIIIIIIIIIIDGE RACEEEEEEEER!!!\n\nSo here's this Giant Enemy Crab\n\nAttack its weak point for MASSIVE DAMAGE!\n\nHistorically accurate feudal Japan\n\nIt's funny that we're still not living that down after we got our *actual* feudal Japan game.\n\nMan at least the PS3 had more value from the fact that it doubled as a Blu Ray Player while being substantially cheaper than standalone Blu Ray Players at the time. \n\nAlso it was basically 3 consoles in one.\n\nThis is 100% the reason I got the PS3 bundled with MGS4. Still have this sucker - box and all, too.\n\nIt's almost funny that even non-gamers have the console just because they can use it to watch movies at a fraction of the cost of a standard blu-ray player.\n\n\"599 U.S. DOLLARS\".\n\n$951 today adjusted for inflation!\n\nI could be wrong but they were still selling PS3s at a large loss initially—like 300 per console. Those bluray drives were a huge value and initially a bluray player cost anywhere from 400-800 dollars alone iirc\n\nAbsolutely not\n\nThis is possibly the most bullshit product in the history of gaming.\n\nSure there's plenty of shitty consoles and peripherals, but nothing at this scale, as a frontline entry by one of the biggest brands in the industry...and so utterly useless.\n\nThe PS5 isn't even close to being fully utilized yet.  There's maybe 3 games out there that are actually next gen in terms of hardware potential.  And even they're just entry level.\n\nWhoever buys this is a fucking imbecile.\n\nI spend most of my time playing old ps4 games because of how few truly next gen games there are. There is nothing to justify a pro version of this console.\n\nI'm happy with my PS5, but truth be told, only because of reduced loading times.  \n\nOutside of Demon Souls, I'm hard-pressed to think of any must-play games on it that you can't get elsewhere.\n\nI’m the same way. I can’t think of any PS5 exclusives aside from Demons Souls that I’ve been interested in\n\nReturnal is pretty good but I’m pretty sure it’s on PC now. But if you had to pick a next gen feeling game that would be one of them imo.\n\n£700 and the vertical stand is still sold separately 🥹\n\nAnd so is the disc drive. 🫠\n\n$700 dollars! I'm not sure if that's worth an upgrade honestly\n\nNo disk drive either.\n\nDigital Foundry made a good point about this. Given the price, the PS5 pro will likely appeal to enthusiasts for the most part. The problem with that is enthusiasts typically like to have physical copies of their games as well. Not having a disc drive is going to be a massive turn off for the audience this console is trying to appeal towards. This is of course just speculation, so we'll just have to see how the sales turn out.\n\nThis describes me perfectly. No physical disc drive is a dealbreaker at any price.\n\nwithout a disc drive its basically a pc where playstation controls your entire digital library.\n\n~~Doesn't~~ Sony sells a separated disk drive. It's less of controlling your library and more of nick and diming their customers IMO.\n\nIt’s $80.  \n\nSo getting this thing and then a disc drive is $780.  That’s a steep proposition for a console.  I think we’ve learned by now that the highest base price people are willing to pay is $500 for a console (I’m aware there are SKUs that go higher, but those typically have pack-ins or other gimmicks that sweeten the deal).  I think this thing is going to flop.  Those willing to spend this much I think are more likely to spend more and get a gaming PC.\n\nDont forget the stand is also sold separately 😬\n\nlmao what?\n\nAt the bargain price of $40. It's actually comical.\n\nWant the stand? It costs extra\n\n&gt;\tIt’s less of controlling your library and more of nick and diming their customers IMO.\n\nIt’s both. Buying a digital game means you only have *temporary* access to it. Buying a physical game means you have permanent access to it, with all else being equal.\n\nEdit: all else being equal as in not needing a day one patch to run, the disc actually has all the files on it, and not needing a network check for a strictly offline game or something. And obviously if an online game is discontinued by the makers themselves, you can’t blame Sony for that (mostly).\n\nNot always, having to download critical files for DRM purposes or needing to ping a server before you can play your \"physical\" game is still a thing... or they can just remove the ability to use the dis... oh lol..\n\nThat’d be true if all game data was stored on the disc. A lot of the data is digital now and they can turn off access to a disc just the same as a digital download. The disc is basically just a key card\n\nSony saw they finally have no real competitors in the console market so they reverted back to their most anti-consumer form and mindset\n\nEdit: for those who are defending this price and the big corporation, just to be clear, I’m a fan of Sony products and have been a PS guy my whole life. But Sony do plenty of anti-consumer bs in lots of their products, and they will keep doing it if nobody calls out their bs. They did so with launch PS3’s high price, tiny storage and unfriendly developing environment which lead to the lack of games until the very late stage of that console generation, memory cards for PS Vita, their cameras, phones, music players, headphones, etc. PS5 is already plenty anti-consumer with the save backup functionality locked behind PS Plus AND they raised the price for PS Plus last year. Ofc you can keep doing whatever you want and pay for how much you want to Sony, but a regular person with common financial sense will and should call this bs out. And I sincerely hope Sony will learn a lesson that’s honestly long overdue for them.\n\nI’d give gold to this if i had the money. This is why. Without competition they’ll just do whatever they want.\n\nWell if this tanks Sony is going to find out exactly how much competition it has. \n\nI remember the Xbox 360 days when Xbox was \"absolutely untouchable\". Hell I remember when every console was \"a Nintendo\". These things turn on a dime.\n\ne: Between everyone who's \"arguing\" with me by proving my point that these things come and go, and everyone who's \"arguing\" with me by digging in their heels on non-sequitirs, it's clear the fanboyism is hard at play right now and I'm not interested in dealing with that. I'm turning off inbox replies.\n\nSame here most of my games are physical it not having a drive means instant no for me. Honestly if all digital is the way things have to go then fine but imma do that the pc way if need be. Paying extra on top for the drive is asinine.\n\nMy PS5 is also my Blu-ray player so fuck this, I ain't upgrading.\n\n90% of the reason I upgraded from PS4 was for the 4K UHD player. Great value for that and a game console.\n\nThis is my exact reasoning, too. I’ve had my ps5 for about 7 months and my movie collection has grown tenfold what my game collection has.\n\nGeez, I missed the lack of disc drive. Yeah, that's a non-starter for me. Don't get me wrong, I don't hate digital, I love my steam library, and I've got games on my PS5 that are digital only that I could probably never find a physical copy of, but I'm sure as hell not going to make the switch mid-generation (not that I particularly want to given the state of 'not owning our games').\n\n[removed]\n\nIt feels like they’re trying to gaslight people into thinking digital is the objectively better way to go.\n\nwell, for Sony it for sure is. No 2nd hand market, no third party deals, no lending of games to friends, etc... \n\nyou always have to pay what sony asks and cannot wait for prime day, black friday, etc...\n\n&gt; well, for Sony it for sure is. No 2nd hand market, no third party deals, no lending of games to friends, etc...\n\nYeah it's totally anti consumer\n\nyeah... and the weird thing for me: on PC I'm fine with buying stuff digital, but on console it just feels wrong... the deals are not nearly as good as steam/epic and the base prices are higher...\n\nThe deals are better and it’s easier to upgrade storage on a pc, I can just add another hard drive without having to copy any files over or anything. I know external hard drives exist but those aren’t as convenient or fast (they might be fast now I dont remember them being particularly quick in the past though)\n\nThe thing with PC is that Steam isn't the only way you can buy games. There are multiple storefronts. With PlayStation. You're stuck in their locked in ecosystem\n\nI have seen lots of people commenting on reddit that their only reason for upgrading is GTA6. \n\nLike... okay I guess? The differences showed for Last of Us, Spiderman 2 and Ratchet and Clank were not ground breaking.\n\nYes, this generation is a fuck fest\n\n700 and no physical games without another purchase....extremely hard pass.\n\nIf they were going one or the other, should only have been one with a disk drive.\n\nOh, they can fuck right the hell off.\n\nalso 700$ and no disc tray at all, have to buy the attachment if u want to play any of you old games. what a joke\n\nStand sold separately too btw.\n\nNot sure:\n\n#I’m absolutely sure\n\nNo disc drive and £700. Fuck off.\n\nIt's also $700 in the US, which is around £530, they literally just changed the currency. What a disgrace.\n\nI would have considered it for £530, but £700 is nothing short of laughable\n\nFrom Playstation's website.\n\n\"The PS5 Pro console will be available this holiday at a manufacturer’s suggested retail price (MSRP) of $699.99 USD, £699.99 GBP, €799.99 EUR, and ¥119,980 JPY (includes tax). It will include a 2TB SSD, a DualSense wireless controller and a copy of Astro’s Playroom pre-installed in every PS5 Pro purchase\" \n\nIt is indeed £699.\n\nWhere the fuck is 699.99$ equal to 799.99€? It’s 634€! Goddamn! I’d rather get a PC worth 3-4 times more than that than even the 500€ release price of the first ps5 and the ridiculous ps plus subs prices nowadays. Fuck Sony\n\nYeah I wonder why Europe is paying so much more for this shit\n\n700 plus tax in many states, Texas will be 6.25% so 745$\n\nThat converted is still 570 so where the fuck did 700£ come from, daylight robbery\n\nI'm looking at stockx they have ps5s selling as low as 271, way better deal tbh\n\n$960 here in Canada. With my provincial sales tax rate it'll come to $1104 CAD. Fuck that and the horse they rode in on.\n\nMy pretty high end Gaming PC I just built didn't cost me very much more than that.\n\nAnd again, pretty high end. I could have built something that was good enough and would outlast the current console generation for $1104. Not including monitors and such.\n\nI don't doubt it. It's been years since I've built a PC so mine's basically obsolete. \n\nI mean you need a TV or monitor for a console anyways. And it's not like your other peripherals are going to cost more than the 4 or 5 dual sense you'll need to buy over the life of the console thanks to stick drift.\n\nEU price is 800 EURO WTFFFF\n\nI'm confused who is going to buy that? I'm in one of the EU countries with higher average salaries and I'm not going near it at that price. I'm pretty astounded.\n\nWas interested in buying a used PS5 a month ago and thought to myself that i might as well wait for the Pro announcement. Fuck that not gonna pay 800€ for a console lmao\n\nNo stand either, it's beyond ridiculous lol\n\nYou can potentially build a ~~better~~ similar performance PC with 800 euros, which is funny because the main selling point of consoles are their lower prices\n\nAnd another main selling point is having physical media. Anyone who buys this is supporting the death of physical media.\n\nCan you though? I'm genuinely asking because it feels like GPUs as good as the one in the PS5 are also stupid expensive.\n\nYou can't. The PS5 Pro essentially comes with a 7800XT, which is around $500 by itself. Doesn't leave you with enough money to also buy the rest of the computer.\n\nI know it was expected, but... £700!!!!\n\nJesus  Christ... 🤣\n\nlmfao early PS3-era Sony is so back\n\nEdit: for those who are defending this price and the big corporation, just to be clear, I’m a fan of Sony products and have been a PS guy my whole life. But Sony do plenty of anti-consumer bs in lots of their products, and they will keep doing it if nobody calls out their bs. They did so with launch PS3’s high price, tiny storage and unfriendly developing environment which lead to the lack of games until the very late stage of that console generation, memory cards for PS Vita, their cameras, phones, music players, headphones, etc. PS5 is already plenty anti-consumer with the save backup functionality locked behind PS Plus AND they raised the price for PS Plus last year. Ofc you can keep doing whatever you want and pay for how much you want to Sony, but a regular person with common financial sense will and should call this bs out. And I sincerely hope Sony will learn a lesson that’s honestly long overdue for them.\n\nAt least the PS3 had the brand new blu-ray tech in it, multiple card readers, 4x USB ports, full hardware-based PS1 and PS2 emulation and so much more that was cutting edge for it's time.  \n\n\nMeanwhile this has no disc drive and 'AI upscaling'. Actually shocking how poor this is from Sony. The least appealing console they've ever launched. \n\nAnd for all the early PS3 era faults, Sony responded by unleashing an onslaught of console exclusive bangers to help close the gap quickly. This gen…?\n\nI mean, Astro Bot looks fun, I’ll probably pick that up. But where is everyone else?? Sucker Punch? Housemarque? Blue Point? Naughty Dog? Spider-Man 2 DLC? Sony’s given us barely anything, in terms of what is on the horizon or what to look forward to, which gets me worried.\n\nI'm a big racing game fan and still sad at the death of the likes of Motorstorm, DriveClub, ModNation Racers, WipeOut.   \n\n\nAll fantastic PS Exclusive racing franchises thrown away\n\nNeed a petition to bring Motorstorm back. One and two were soo F'ing good. The apocalypse one was decent as well, but it didn't capture the vibe from one and two as well as it should have.\n\nThis has been such a weak generation from Sony. Theres still barely any PS5 exclusives. Which means virtually none of the games even utilize the full power of the current PS5. Now they’re selling a Pro version? \n\nWhen GTA 6 launches, if it does some cool shit on the Pro I may pick it up then. Otherwise, meh. This has been a bad generation for Sony, and this isn’t helping them\n\nBut think of all that *Pro* you're getting. So much *Pro*.\n\nSO much Pro you will have to visit a PROctologist once Sony is done with you.\n\nYeah hopefully this fails and we get rid of exorbitantly priced mid cycle console upgrades\n\nI feel like £650 with disc drive and stand included would have been much easier to swallow.\n\nAbsolutely. £700 for no disk drive and no stand? And US getting it like $200 cheaper? Yeah they can f*ck right off\n\n$700 for this thing is absolutely BONKERS seeing as the PS5 was $500 at release. What the hell is this?\n\nSony has gotten too cocky again for being on top during the previous generation. Their pricing scheme for the PS5 Pro is eerily similar to their OG PS3 price announcement. I wouldn't be surprised if the head of SIE would tell us to just get a 3rd or 4th job to afford it.\n\nThere is also no disc drive. So people like me that only buy physical copies of PS games, can't even get it because they won't be able to play their games.\n\nOh but there is a disc drive... as a separate add-on for another $80.\n\nAh yes, an $800 console...\n\nJesus\n\nIt's 700$ for US. For EU it's 800€ which is 882$. For UK it's 700£ so 930$. It's PS3 situation again.\n\nSweet jesus WHY?? I don't get it. I know they're not going to be cheap but this just seems insane to me.\n\nInflation and no real competition. Xbox is falling in sales. \n\nAs a PC Gamer im just waiting for the Switch 2. \nDont need neither Xbox or PS5 (Pro)\n\nHonestly the only appeal to ps5 pro was for GTA 6, but at this price point I'd rather just wait the year+ for it to come to PC\n\n&gt;seeing as the PS5 was $500 at release.\n\nYou mean $400. The pro doesn't come with a disk drive, it's like the ps5 digital that you need to buy it separately. So it's a $300 increase\n\n£700 - fuck off 😂\n\n[deleted]\n\nAnd £25 for the stand so it doesn't fall over when a light breeze passes by\n\nSo £825 for the full kit and caboodle \n\nAnd the DualSense got a £5 price increase this week\n\nYep. Have fun with your stick-drift controllers and GARBAGE TIER battery. AND basically no third party options (which I have 100% no doubt  Sony's grubby hands has a play on why this is), means you are fucked no matter what WHEN the issues pop up.\n\n&gt;which I have 100% no doubt Sony's grubby hands has a play on why this is\n\nOh, we already know this is the case. If you are familiar at all with arcade sticks / fight sticks, a huge headache is the fact that Sony uses hardware authentication to (attempt to) prevent the use of unlicensed controllers. Pretty much every third-party stick on the market requires a separate adapter dongle or some other bypass to pass the authentication and actually function.\n\nWtf is even so good about the pro anyway? For that much money I can probably upgrade by getting a 4070 Ti.\n\nAnd that 4070 ti will go way further than the pro will.\n\nAlmost double what a digital only PS5 is going for on Amazon right now, damn. I don't understand the value proposition on this one, and I'm a person who upgraded their PS4 to a Pro\n\nwas gonna say i could buy two PS5's. Delusional pricing that.\n\n800€ in Europe. \n\nNo f***ing way. Thats nuts. \nI dont see that sold that well in Europe.\n\nWay to expensive.\n\nIn France, it's literally the price of two digital PS5\n\nThat's **CRAZY**\n\nWas going to get one for GTA and Spider-Man 2 but might as well wait them out for PC  releases lol, 800 is way too expensive like you said\n\nCPU is almost the same as base version so GTA will launch at 30fps.\n\nYeah, higher fidelity at 30fps is worth exactly 0 dollars to me. 60fps on every 30fps exclusive game (or in the quality modes at least) and I would be interested.\n\n\nI don't understand why companies don't get that frame rate is a component of image quality, especially in motion.\n\nI'm keeping my regular PS5 tbh\n\nIt’s cost $950 Canadian thats insane\n\nPlus tax 😅\n\nThat pricing is quite frankly, Absurd.\n\nI watched it all, and other than the framerate increases, I couldn't notice better graphics.\n\nEdit to add, if anything this should drive the sales of the Regular PS5 higher, if it also results in a price drop, then sales should grow considerably, Maybe that's the idea.\n\nBad tongues would talk about Sony increasing the price of the base ps5 a few months ago to better \"prepare\" their customers for the price reveal of the pro\n\n&gt;if it also results in a price drop\n\nThey JUST raised the prices in Japan for the base PS5 like a week ago...\n\nThis is some nonsense.\n\nSo... you sell your PS5 to upgrade, pocket maybe $250 - $300?\n\nEven with that you're still dropping $400 - $500ish on a frame boost.\n\nMaybe I’ll actually buy a ps5 now if I can get one for $300\n\nI agree. Though, to be fair, we are seeing footage that ultimately gets compressed for YouTube.\n\nThat was a great ad for a new GPU for my PC.\n\nI'm putting those 800 euros to upgrade to the 9800X3D / AM5 and DDR5 lmao\n\nWhat even is this? Moderate improvments to already existing games? Sometimes multiple years old? Why? And $700?! That's wild. \n\n\nEverything they showed is most likey something PS5 owners have already played through (I know I have finished all of those titles save Hogwarts and TLoO2) - and if you are looking for a giant leap in fidelity and performance you can get a PC...\n\n\nI think the only shot this thing had is if it launched alongside a Bloodborne Remake.\n\n\nYeesh.\n\n&gt;Moderate improvements to already existing game?\n\nIsn’t this what every pro version does?\n\nWell given the previous history of pro models being limited to just the PS4 Pro, then yes, moderate improvements is all\n\nThe PS4 Pro showed a much larger improvement in a shorter timespan (3 years vs 4). The GPU was 120% more powerful, the CPU was 33% faster, and they added 1 GB of ram. The disk drive wasn't removed, and the price was the same as the original's launch price. \n\nAlso, the One X was essentially a \"pro\" console, and the improvement was extremely better than this.\n\nVote with your wallet as usual.\n\nI couldn't vote *for* this even if I wanted to.\n\n[deleted]\n\nDon't forget the 30$ for the vertical stand because it doesn't come with that either\n\n[deleted]\n\nThen they would have to discount the regular PS5…\n\n[deleted]\n\nActually, they just [recently increased the price](https://blog.playstation.com/2022/08/25/ps5-price-to-increase-in-select-markets-due-to-global-economic-environment-including-high-inflation-rates/) of the PS5, and now they’ve also [increased the price of the DualSense controllers](https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-quietly-increases-the-price-of-the-playstation-5-dualsense-controller-worldwide).\n\nAll following Concord, the biggest flop in gaming history, and a failure to properly market Astro Bot, their best game of the generation by leaps and bounds.\n\nThey’re going to tank hard, and they deserve it\n\nOooh, $700 to play 6 year old PS4 games? Sign me up!\n\nCan't even do that all my fave PS4 games I have on physical.\n\nRight? Sony is crazy if they think this thing is appealing to anyone\n\nVote with your wallet! Absolutely not.\n\n\\*Vertical stand sold separately\n\nAnd Disk Drive!\n\nMan the greed is really running rampant everywhere...\n\nIt's crazy because even though it's more powerful, I would consider it a downgrade from my launch PS5 if it has no disc tray.  Pay $700 for a downgrade, zero chance.  Like I wouldn't even TRADE my PS5 for a PS5 Pro straight up.\n\nThey can go fuck themselves for that amount and no disc drive.\n\nSomeone must've thought that \"enthusiast\" meant \"sucker\" at Sony HQ. The console is practically an insult even to those who can comfortably afford it, and basically has no market otherwise.\n\n$700 and no disc drive\n\nNo thanks\n\nCool, but are any games currently pushing the standard PS5’s hardware?\n\nGames are starting to get really fucking lazy using FSR as a crutch to boost performance. Space marine 2's performance mode is absolutely dogshit. Performance and Image Quality. For what is a pretty basic looking game, it's performance metrics are baffling.\n\nWatch how they gonna remaster Last of Us again just for the pro version.\n\nNo disc drive? No buy\n\n[deleted]\n\nNot sure if the specs are worth 700$\n\n&gt;no bloodborne remaster\n&gt;no new games\n&gt;$ 700\n\n\nThis is dead in the water\n\nNo disc drive btw\n\n800€? For a console? 50 more and I can buy a fucking 4080 Super brand new.\n\nSony has officially lost their marbles lmao\n\nFor 150 less you can get a 4070 Super, which is almost on par with a 3090.\n\nDisgusting prices.\n\nNo wonder they didn't do a big event for this\n\nThe entire point of gaming consoles is that they're supposed to be a much cheaper &amp; more user friendly option for playing video games compared to an actual PC; affordable plug &amp; play experiences.\n\n  \nIf consoles are going to abandon what sets them apart and just become gimped gaming PCs, then there's no reason for people to not just get a PC for gaming.\n\nCharging $700 for a console without a disk drive, in the middle of the generation, and with no exclusives is wild.\n\nMight buy it to get the most out of Stardew Valley\n\nThis is what happens when Playstation has no real competition. They throw prices like this out. Get your shit together, Xbox\n\nthat won't happen, and Nintendo is in their own world so fuck man, next gen is looking rough lol\n\nSix hundred and ninety nine US dollars is deranged.\n\nThe most impressive thing about the PS5 Pro might be that it makes the Xbox Series S look retroactively like a smart move.\n\nOkay Nintendo, time to reveal the Switch 2 at a €349 price point, and hardware that’s less than 3 years old\n\nYep, I think I will go with nintendo when switch 2 comes, pc plus switch is all I need\n\nDaylight robbery. 800€ in Europe with no disc drive, no PS5 stand and just to have constant 60fps ??? There's is NO point in PS5 pro.\n\nI feel like if you added a few more of those black ridges, you'd get an accordion\n\nSomehow PS3 has returned\n\nExcept worse because ps3 was the cheapest Blu-Ray player when it released. So it had a use. This doesn’t even accept discs without an add on\n\n800 euros, who the fuck is gonna buy this\n\n$700 is DoA. That's $300 more than an original all digital PS5. The only people buying this are content creators and people with fuck it money.\n\nIn the UK this is double the price of a digital ps5 (£350 vs £700).\n\n&gt;Other enhancements include PS5 Pro Game Boost, which can apply to more than 8,500 backward compatible PS4 games playable on PS5 Pro. This feature may stabilize or improve the performance of supported PS4 and PS5 games. Enhanced Image Quality for PS4 games is also available to improve the resolution on select PS4 games. PS5 Pro will also launch with the latest wireless technology, Wi-Fi 7, in territories supporting this standard. VRR and 8K gaming are also supported. 2TB SSD. \n\nSome welcome changes but damn the price.\n\n8k gaming lmao\n\nYou don’t have an 8K TV??\n\n\"Don't you guys have 8K phones?\"\n\nUpscaling a 720p resolution game to 4k/8k should count as deceptive advertisement.\n\nNot that shocking, Sony has consistently shit the bed price-wise this entire gen. We're four years in and the price for a disc model has only dropped $50 from launch. Even the Slim launched at $500, the same price as the original model, which is fucking insane when those have historically been intended as the budget option.\n\nEdit: Jesus christ I just saw that you have to buy the disc drive separately for another $80. These people are fucking insane.\n\nI've never bought a Pro version of a console. Maybe this one?\n\n\n$700\n\n\nTROLLOLOLOLL NOPE.\n\nThe core argument that they're making, of not having to pick between performance and fidelity and instead hitting 60 with fidelity, isn't really enough to justify this. \n\nI can't name a single game that looked bad on performance settings. I just treat performance as the default, or I even run games in PS4 mode. I may not be Digital Foundry, but I am sensitive to performance and to visual clarity, and on a 4k screen I haven't had any problems with the visuals. \n\nThat's different than other pro releases. The New 3DS made the 3d effect massively better, increased the size of the screen, added more controls, and improved performance. The PS4 pro opened games up to having fidelity or fps options to keep up with the then-increasing demands, when the base PS4 had bad loading times and poor framerates that held the console back. \n\nThe current PS5 has amazing loading times, great performance and fidelity options, and games that broadly target the specs. Demon's Souls on performance mode is the prettiest game I've ever played and Horizon Forbidden West on performance is up there. Even with the advent of far more powerful pcs, no high profile games have even tried to push the hardware, and performance failures have primarily been because of the CPU, which devs have as a trend forgotten how to worry about. This doesn't update the CPU meaningfully. \n\nPrevious pro releases stayed with the standard price, or did a mild increase, while lowering the cost of their base consoles. \n\nNothing about this lines up with the motivation or marketing of previous pro consoles, and that's scary. They practically announced it in the release. \"3 out of 4 players prefer performance when given the option. We aren't improving performance.\" was the pitch.   \n  \nThis is Sony getting overconfident, and ideally they get punished for it. Ray tracing and AI upscaling just aren't important features to 90% of gamers, and hopefully $700 usd is more valuable to people than brand loyalty.\n\n\"Vertical stand sold seperately\"\n\nSony returning to their villain era.\n\n\"A global cost of living crisis is the _perfect_ time to release our luxury-priced frivolities machine!\" - Sony, for some fucking reason\n\nNo disc Drive?\n\nit’s an insane gut punch considering plenty of people have old libraries of games, and clearly sony gives 0 shots about backwards compatibility\n\nFinally, I can play the remaster of my favorite PS3 games in their full glory!\n\nDoes it come with a demo for Concord?\n\nYeah but what games honestly? I can't think of a decent PS5 exclusive which warrants even an upgrade at this late in the generation. PC has most of the games covered by now\n\nThis reception is eerily reminiscent of Sony's 2006 PS3 launch at $599 that did so well.\n\n$700 is vile. And what am I to do with the physical games I bought? Ah, that's right, $80 for a disc drive addon. Disgusting.\n\nFor $700 they could have included the Dual Edge controller.\n\nFuck off sony\n\nThat going to be a no from me.\n\nI was holding out for the Pro. Now I feel like a massive cunt. No disk drive, no deal.\n\nI hope there will be a huge backlash\n\nSony has entered its Apple era\n\nIt's a miracle the console will even have a controller included\n\nI’m old enough to remember it used to ship with two controllers…\n\nI know they have to make up the money from concord but this isn't gonna work.\n\nI'll take my Switch 2 (whenever it releases) for very likely less than this thing's base model's cost.\n\nFuck off Sony\n\nL.\n\nNo disc drive, stand not included, no new games taking advantage of a $700 system.\n\n$700 with no disc drive or stand. WTF? This is absurd pricing. If you’re going to need all that, you might as well start building a PC, holy shit. The regional pricing is even worse:\n\n- ⁠£700 is currently $914 USD\n- ⁠€800 is currently $882 USD\n- ¥119,980 is currently $841 USD\n\nThe UK and EU really getting the short end of the stick with this one. If you’re also getting the disc drive and stand, you’re well over $1000 USD in those markets.\n\nNo disc drive? That's a deal breaker. Does sony have an external disc drive?\n\nWhat a joke piece of shit. Will they falsely advertise 16k on this one this time? You have to BUY a disc tray attachment. Let me just say this fellas. I recently bought a new computer for 1000 dollars that had twice the power of this thing. Consoles are a fucking scam nowadays.\n\nJesus Christ, €800 and the disc drive AND stand are extra?\n\nWe're talking close to €1000 for a Playstation. Never has the argument 'just get a PC' been more valid.\n\n$700 and no disc drive. Sony can fuck right off with that one. \n\nAnd basically it has AMD fidelity RX to artificially boost performance. No thanks"

    "all_comment_text": "Every issue the games industry had from 2000-2015 was because of vivendi it's not surprising\n\nDon’t worry, they’re part of Activision/Blizzard now, so they are kind of still part of every issue the gaming industry has to this day.\n\nThis has acutally quite a funny story behind it.\n\nBobby Kotick saw in 2006 that MMOs monthly suscription model was lucrative, and noticed that Burning Crusade was an absolute cultural phonmenon.\n\nHe wanted a piece of the pie, but Activision did not have any experience with MMOs, so he outright approached Vivendi's CEO to offer him to buy Blizzard. The CEO refused, and down the line offered a fusion of both companys.\n\nThis in turn would lead to Activision Blizzard, and Bobby Kotick ruining Blizzard, just because he wanted to own World of Warcraft.\n\nI miss the times when videogames were a 'fad' and the suits didn't care.\n\n\nNow they all want their  grubby little hands on every franchise and to implement [current buzzword] into them..\n\nIndie games are the only place where the dream is still alive, because they are too small for them to care.\n\nStardew Valley\n\n\nSoftware Inc\n\n\nSlay the Spire\n\n\nAstroneer\n\n\nDyson Sphere Program\n\n\nThe Long Dark\n\n\nTurmoil \n\n\nThey Are Billions\n\n\nRimworld\n\n\nStardew Valley\n\n\nFTL\n\n\nSubnautica\n\n\nParkitect\n\n\nGame Dev Tycoon\n\n\nTo The Moon\n\n\nThis War of Mine\n\n\nOffworld Traading Company.. \n\n\nI have 100 hours in almost all of them, and some of them I'm closing in on 1,000. We're in a golden age of indie games.\n\nStardew Valley so good it got on the list twice.\n\nIt’s the New York of games\n\nStardew is god tier of gaming. Not sure how many hours I have in total, as I play it on Steam, mobile, and have played on gamepass in the past, but it's in the thousands. \n\nSo much better with friends, even better with mods :)\n\nIt's not really my cup of tea, I could never get into it solo, never enjoyed it without at least Automate to make it less tedious, and mostly played with friends.\n\nI still have 210 hours in it though. Pretty impressive for not really being my kinda game.\n\nTotally get that. I only play it on my phone when on the bus or something. Otherwise on PC, with mods, and friends.\n\nThere's a severe lack of Oxygen not Included in this\n\nIs Klei considered indie?\n\nI would argue yes but I believe they had tencent buy a bunch of them so maybe not anymore?\n\nTencent coming in to fuck the games you love once a company shows it can be lucrative. A tale as old as time at this point.\n\nThis list requires Project Zomboid.\n\nDon't forget Terraria. The indie game that became so big, everyone forgets it is an indie game.\n\nBalatro too friend\n\nFactorio\n\nYou've got great taste, but you're missing Hollow Knight, the best of the bunch.\n\nI find indie games are all I play now. AAA games - even in the rare cases where developers really care and make something amazing - are so big it's hard to find the time to invest in them.\n\nI'm the exact same. Games like Elden Ring, for example, I would've gone crazy for when I was younger. But no I'm tired and want nice music and charming characters with a plotline.\n\nIt’s like Steve Jobs said about how companies thrive when the talent runs the show. But eventually fall because the people with MBA’s in marketing get promoted to the top and only look at how to make money over offering products. These people will step over a dollar to pick up a penny.\n\nIn that case whatever you do, don't start looking into the history of Star Wars Galaxies and how trying to copy WoW turned it into a shadow of it's former self all because it was chasing dollars. \n\n\nI've been gaming for over 40 years and the loss of SWG is the most raw to me.\n\nI remember thinking of Blizz as the greatest devs, with a lot of integrity (except the harassment which we've learned about since), great game design and a consistent record of releasing amazing games. Imagine my devastation when I found out they were owned by Vivendi, who I hated for what they did to Valve, and then they got into Activision, an arguably worse company, like how is this even possible??\n\nBlizzard in its heyday used to employ some of the absolute best game devs who ever worked in the industry, and it allowed them to work in a \"product first\" environment. The goal was to make the best game possible, with the understanding that chasing excellence would bring profits.\n\nI recall a time in my youth back when Diablo 2 was current. Gold selling was considered a massive issue. The dev team made strong public statements against gold selling. The very concept of a player spending real world money to get a competitive advantage in the game world was considered abhorrent.\n\nAt a certain point when I was a World of Warcraft player, I watched in real time as their corporate mentality completely switched. Activision-Blizzard chose to change the objective to chasing profits, and they lost excellence in the process. That's the Bobby Kotick effect.\n\nAfter Steve bannon finished working as ceo of biosphere 2 he started in the nascent gold selling industry and got involved in gamergate, before working with then-candidate trump on his election campaign. Before going to prison earlier this year he helped get RFK to run\n\nJust a little insight into the kinds of people working with the gold farmer industry\n\nIf I remember rightly Mike Ybarra was selling boosts when he was president of Blizzard. \n\nI keep trying to get back into WoW but it's just lacked the magic for a long while.\n\nThe community drove me away from WoW in the end. It was a great game. Then the stewardship of the game was ruined with the Activision merger. Slowly but surely they made change after change to maximize profits via whales. After years of pay-to-progress was drilled into the player base and bot farming was normalized as a part of the economy, the social dynamics within the community changed. Everybody became obsessed with obtaining rewards and rankings in the most optimal way instead of enjoying the *process* of obtaining those things organically.\n\nWhen you’re a publicly traded company that makes one of the most profitable products in the modern world, big fish *will* come swimming looking for a piece of the pie. \n\nBlizzard themselves couldn’t really stop the sale of ownership, it’s just *really* rich guys trading companies among each other, the end result is video games.\n\n[removed]\n\nthat's just the project managers and RTO-mandatory staff trying to figure out what they're supposed to even do in a software company when they don't write code\n\nWell they were basically a Frat house making games for fun. The kids working there literally took pay cuts just to be a part of the group dynamic, it was so legendary. \n\nThe higher-ups let them do whatever they wanted as long as the games got good and on time. \n\nNow, you might be asking yourself “why don’t we do that today?!?”  And there’s a good reason for that.  Drunk college aged men turn into animals and harass and abuse everyone when left unchecked. \n\nYou can literally find articles on this whole thing with Blizzard right now. They were a bit of a monster, and Bobby Kotick was just the perfect storm of a boss to let them get away with it as it continued to spiral unchecked.\n\nDon't ask why a prominent Overwatch character got his name changed overnight\n\nReading Play Nice, the book about Blizzard, and the amount of times I've said \"Man, fuck Bobby Kotick\" was astounding. Dude honestly ruined Blizzard, along with so many other franchises simply because of short term growth.\n\nWe all already knew before he bought blizzard. He was the guy who killed Guitar Hero. Then, the guy who \"killed\" classic call of duty by fighting the guys from Infinity Ward to the point of them leaving after the original Modern Warfare 2, starting Respawn Entertainment, and creating Titanfall.\n\nI remember discussing how the purcahse of Blizzard was a bad omen in high school after class, between me, a guy who played Guild wars 1 and Call of duty and a bestie who played WoW since WoW classic.\n\nHe has always been a ugly sack of shit.\n\nEDIT: Like, I was about to purchase the book, but then someone described me what it goes on about and I was like: Wait I already know all of this, i have lived through this.\n\nI had a friend who worked in the activision QA department years ago, and Kotick said that people working on and testing games were having too much fun at work and implemented a bunch of policies (I can't remember the specifics) designed to make the job more miserable. Like, they weren't even productivity focused, they were just about making sure no one ever cracked a smile at work. He was more cartoonishly evil than Ebeneezer Scrooge.\n\nHe’s the human embodiment of rot economy\n\nCorrection: They're part of Microsoft now. \n\nSo they're now connected to Bethesda Game Studios, ZeniMax Online Studios, id Software, Arkane Studios, Machine Games, Tango Gameworks, Alpha Dog Games, Roundhouse Studios, Blizzard, Treyarch, Infinity Ward, High Moon Studios, Toys for Bob, Raven Software, Sledgehammer Games, Beenox, Radical Entertainment, Vicarious Visions, Rare, 343, The Coalition, Mojang, Ninja Theory, Playground Games, Undead Labs, Compulsion Games, Obsidian Entertainment, InXile Entertainment and Double Fine.\n\nLucky us.\n\nThey call it \"activision blizzard\" but let's be real, the relationship between Blizzard and Activision is that between a male and female anglerfish.\n\nSo, a redundant prick.\n\nAnd the franchise that probably brings in the most money isnt even in the company name (candy crush).\n\nYea, holy shit. I don’t think a lot of people know that Candy Crush is 100% the bread winner of the company.\n\nKinda like how Hasbro owns Wizards of the Coast, and people may assume they get DnD money hand over fist.\n\nNope. It's Magic the Gathering that's the real cash cow.\n\nActivision taught the shareholders that spending some pocket change developing Candy Crush was a much better business than spending millions on AAA games like Overwatch.\n\nHuh?\n\nI don't have a list but Valve recently released a documentary on the 20th anniversary of half life 2, they go into a fair bit their lawsuit with vivendi and how scummy they are and how they almost killed: Valve, steam and half life.\n\nThe evidence shows Vivendi are criminally corrupt:\n\n\n\nThat needle was discovered by a summer intern who's only identified as \"Andrew\" in the documentary. Andrew was a native Korean speaker, so he was put to work looking through all these documents in order to find something useful. As Quackenbush explains, \"He said, 'Well, there's these other emails between these vice presidents, where one says something like, \"Hey, we destroyed those Valve documents like you asked.\"' And I said, 'Are you sure it says that?' And he said, 'Yeah, that's what it says.'\"\n\nObviously, destroying evidence is a bit of a no-no in the legal world. Vivendi disputed Andrew's mistranslation, but he was both a native Korean speaker and had a major in Korean language studies at UCLA. As Newell recalls, following the revelation of this email, the judge essentially concluded that \"All matters of fact are now according to Valve. You don't get to contest any of those. Now we're just discussing how much you're gonna have to pay and what the damages are.\" And thus, Valve survived to change PC gaming forever.\n\nI had no idea who Vivendi was before watching that documentary, but now I hate them. They were indicative of the profit-driven, creatively-bankrupt cancer that would eventually swallow most/all AAA game development.\n\nThe only think that trickles down from the top is trouble.\n\nWait which documentary?\n\nhttps://youtu.be/YCjNT9qGjh4\n\nCriminally corrupts and still making 13.000B € a year.   \nThe world is such a fair place\n\nAnd Spyro!\n\n/Yes, we're counting Enter the Dragonfly here.\n\nStill absolutely disgusted by the redesign for Spyro and using him as a launchpad for Skylanders only to then nudge him out the door completely. \n\nWait, what do you mean they nudged him out the door?\n\nI know about Skylanders and Spyro trying to be the main mascot, I didn't realize he was kicked out too.\n\n[deleted]\n\nHe was dragon down the profits.\n\nBoo lame\n\nHe got Rabbids'd\n\nSkylanders was originally a Spyro game with a similar \"toys to life\" gimmick. It was all dragon characters. There was a demo reel of that very, very barebones concept, you can find it on YouTube, I think.\n\nIt got reworked into the Skylanders known now, with Spyro being involved in some way. Beyond the first game's title, and the 3 figures and their variants, Spyro is not that big of a character, at least in the games.\n\nIn comics and the Netflix show, he was a main character and more prominent than in-game. Wasn't really nudged out the door, just used in various media.\n\nWait, I thought Spyro was a dragon?\n\nWere getting Spyro 4...../copium /cries\n\nOne time I had a lecture with a Vivendi executive in Paris. He spent the first 15 min lecturing us about pirating software and music... The lecture was about marketing.\n\nTook me a minute to realise you meant an academic lecture. Thought some Vivendi exec just cornered you in Paris and started ranting about piracy\n\nTrust me, he did sound like he cornered us in a lecture hall. It was at their own HQ. Felt like indoctrination.\n\nTrying to manipulate young people into feeling bad about piracy is probably the main reason they agreed to do it.\n\nShout out to Disney who used cartoon pirates to teach kids not to copy files from the internet because stealing is wrong\n\nthe height of irony coming from fucking Disney\n\n“You are trying to steal what I’ve rightfully stolen!”\n\nVivendi is also owned by the Bolloré financial family, which are amongst the most influencial and hatable people in France. Everything they touch you can throw away, and they keep touching french politics and media so we'll soon have to throw the 5th republic through the window\n\nVery interesting, didnt know that! Thank you!\n\nBolloré is our Murdoch, buying medias to spout far right bullshit and protect the rich\n\nHe's a piece of shit\n\nEw\n\n\n&gt;buying medias to spout far right bullshit and protect the rich\n\nI have no idea who this Bollore bloke is but I'm not surprised that's his game plan.\n\nI see you too are a fan of defenestration.\n\nName of the documentary?\n\nthere you go https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCjNT9qGjh4. Chapter five they talk about the lawsuit, and the last 10 min approx of chapter 9 too.\n\nHalf-Life 2: 20th Anniversary Documentary\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCjNT9qGjh4\n\nIt's 2 hours long but it's worth it, really interesting :)\n\nIt's on Valve's Youtube channel. Was uploaded in the last couple weeks.\n\nThe perfect example of why people saying \"Companies only do things for money\" is wrong. They also do things because the people in them are complete psychos who would rather destroy tens of millions rather than take the L on some ego thing.\n\nThey also took over and effectively ruined Gameloft, the once-largest mobile game developer and sister company to Ubisoft. They would have pulled the same shit with Ubisoft as well but the Guillemot brothers struck a deal with Tencent to prevent Vivendi's hostile takeover.\n\nWhat do they gain from buying and bankrupting businesses though?\n\nWell, Gameloft didn't go bankrupt. They're still making free-to-play mobile cashgrabs as a mere cog in Vivendi's machine.\n\nShort term stock price increases and higher executive bonuses.\n\nHe's not wrong per se, it's just a complicated take about the corporate side of video game history. Notably, Vivendi bought Activision in 2007 and merged them with Blizzard (who they had owned since 1994), putting their games divisions on par with EA. They also owned the publisher Sierra Entertainment (which people of a certain age will recognize with great nostalgia). \n\n\n\n\nVivendi was / is a *massive* multi-industry conglomerate of which it had subsidiary publisher companies across many mediums, including video games - it's strategy of buying and consolidating studios, pushing recurring subscriptions as a core business model, and aggressively doing cookie cutter licensed tie-in games are business practices that a lot of publishers have adopted. (That said, there were some amazing, original IPs that came out of their stable during the 00s). \n\n\n\n\nFrom a certain point of view, Steam exists as a response to Vivendi (Vivendi was Valve's publisher for their games up thru Half-Life 2 when a legal dispute accelerated their conscious uncoupling). \n\n\n\n\nSo yeah, Vivendi is without a doubt one of the major contributors to the current state of the business side of video games.\n\n&gt;They also owned the publisher Sierra Entertainment (which people of a certain age will recognize with great nostalgia). \n\nPlaying Caesar 3 right this moment. I miss Sierra Entertainment.\n\nCaesar 2 was my favorite of the series.\n\n\"PLEBS ARE NEEDED!\"\n\nI have \"YOU AGAIN!? AAAAAGGHHH!!\" \\*cup smash\\* \\*startled gasps\\* seared into my frontal lobe.\n\nI am not a native English speaker, but to me it always sounded like he said \"You're dead! Raaaargh!\"\n\nMay as well be if you don't get that denarii flowing ASAP!\n\n\"PLEBS ARE NEEDED!\" is burned into my brain.\n\nQuest for Glory tho\n\nThe voice line from that one lad who wants to be a lion tamer lives rent free in my head because of this game\n\nI've still got the original 1/4 floppy disks for police quest. They still work too.\n\nLoved those games growing up. Even 4 with its terrible live graphics that were all the rage at the time\n\nFor those who are too young to remember, Sierra published absolute bangers back in the day such as the original Half-Life, EarthSiege/Starsiege, the original SWAT games... list goes on.\n\nKing's Quest was a very important game at the time\n\nImportant is quite the understatement. It codified and basically birthed a genre that took the pc market by storm (while it may not have been the first graphical adventure game, which coincidentally was *also* made by the founders of then-named on-line systems, later sierra entertainment, it did establish a lot of the genre conventions throughout its run).\n\nLeisure suit Larry too\n\nSwat is part of Sierra onlines police quest line of games from even further back\n\nEarthSiege was a cool concept. It's basically Humans VS Skynet but with Mechs, and the sequel has AI Robots from the moon attacking Earth!\n\nI loved SWAT. One of my favorite games back then.\n\nFEAR and No One Lives Forever as well\n\nThanks to vivendi the NOLF licensing is somewhere in bureaucracy hell and Nightdive can't remake the game, even though they really wanted to. Imagine what we could have had.\n\nVivendi is so bad Activision bought independence from them.\n\n\nYes, one of the greediest companies in gaming hated Vivendi so much and were so concerned of being under them, that they bought their way out.\n\nWhat's funny is Activision was founded because employees from Atari thought they weren't getting enough credit/compensation.\n\nDid you know Vivendi is/was Compagnie Générale des Eaux or CGE who was founded by a certain short king?\n\n\n\nI know emperor but short king is funnier.\n\nSo in short, we need someone to go back and obliterate Vivendi after the creation of Steam, thus penning a slightly better history.\n\nAfter all, with the wretched history we've been handed, we are existentially entitled to scribble down a thousand new histories, in the hopes of penning at least one that's better than this one.\n\n\"Goal complete, and the Vivendi buyouts of gaming studios thwarted, the hero returns to the present. Looking at a news site on the smartphone, tears are shed: 'Musk's Xtavision completes acquisition of Square Enix; vows more alpha males in next FF release.'\"\n\nI miss starsiege tribes.\n\nI should play the new one, I guess.\n\nThey merged their gaming division with Activision in the 00’s to form Activision Blizzard. OP might be a tad hyperbolic but they’re right in that Vivendi are not good guys in gaming (or any business venture really)\n\nThey tried to flood Valve/Steam full of bullshit court cases that almost bankrupted them in their early days, they're literally scum considering without Valve what would we have?\n\nI'd be willing to bet without Steam the indie gaming industry would be a fraction as successful as it is, and many of the amazing games it produced simply wouldn't exist.\n\nLike, Stardew Valley, Terraria, hollow Knight, Dead Cells, Binding of Issac, everything Supergiant... all would probably not exist in a world where everything was decided by a giant publisher.\n\nI've just accepted that every major publishing house is villainous in some way, even valve with their 30% sales cut and CSGO almost single handedly normalizing the modern lootbox scheme. 2€ keys to unlock a 0.03€ skin 95% of the time my ass.\n\nSteam's 30% cut is completely justified though. The offer exposure, transaction handling, hosting, bandwidth, serve as a guarantee that the customer would get a refund, they give a ton. Selling on your own website and keeping 100% vs selling on Steam and keeping 70% is a no-brainer.\n\n\nEven insanely popular companies like Ubisoft and EA find it more profitable to be on Steam than to only sell on their own. Steam's value prpposition is unmatched.\n\nNot to mention all the extra features: the gamepad utility (Especially people with PS gamepads remember the nightmares before that one was ready), coop options through remote play, cloud saves, workshop, community hub and forum. All well worth 30%\n\nAND one aspect not often talked about, generating keys is free. So if you sell your game on humble, fanatical or any other online platform steam doesn't even take the 30% cut.\n\n99% of gamblers quit right before they win big. Keep it up bro\n\nYou could buy the 3 Cent skin for 2,03 and create value. Its all imaginary anyways?\n\nAlso Valve is the reason ultra predatory Season Passes exist. Since they invented them; and did so in a predatory way. They managed to sell 100 dollar skins without making the public angry. Freaking Genius. They think so low of their audience; and they are right.\n\n\nI hope one day people would get that Valve is not the good guy here. What they are is better than Google and Apple. But they still hold a dominant position in the market and we still pay a lot more than we should. \n\nThat 30% sales cut is something that we are carrying from when there was physical media. And whenever you bring this up. There's always a moron that tries to justify it. Why? Because apparently those hundred dollars in comissions I pay Valve a year are worth a forum and being able to rate games. Which Metacritic does for free by the way.\n\nValve is so good at PR that a competitor can come up, offer a 12% freaking percent rate and still be the bad guys.\n\n**Edit**: Just for all the fan boys out there. Look at Valve vs Elliot lawsuit to see how Steam is preventing Publishers to have lower prices on other platforms, like Epic. It prohibits them for selling you a DLC elsewhere for less. It factually **supress competition** of Non Steam Key games. (We all knew about them doing it with steam keys). Doesn't allow you to sell your game for less on other platforms like Steam as a policy. Steam suppresses competition on price. Which is factually the easiest way to enter a market.\n\nAnd it's dumb and bad faith to say that Steam is a better deal than nothing.  OBVIOUSLY!. All MONOPOLIES ARE BETTER THAN NOTHING. OTHERWISE THEY WOULDN'T EXIST.\n\nI don't know if it needed 3 but it definitely deserved a sequel. We got cheated\n\nA much more advanced open world game set in Springfield would have been a lot of fun. Springfield is so large and has such a sprawling set of characters that there is a lot of creative potential there. Just driving around got old but an open world game set in Springfield would be amazing.\n\nAnd let's not forget Dark Springfield... aka Shelbyville.\n\nbut what of our attractive cousins?\n\nGlad I'm not the only one who saw the title and thought this. \n\nWith the context that this was my first ever console game, and I lived and breathed it for at least a year, and then played for years after. This game is *formative* for me and is the thing that hooked me on gaming. I'm glad it was a one and done game.\n\nI hate the way modern media and audiences demand sequel after sequel, draining a popular thing dry until it's just a money husk for soulless corporations to keep flogging. Sometimes a good thing is just great, needs no iterations and nothing dragging it out. A good story requires a good end, not an infinite amount of follow up. Some things are good because they're a tight single film/game or limited run show. \n\nStop demanding sequels, stop demanding whole universes of content for stuff. Otherwise companies will just keep pressing the same button that makes money come out without coming up with new stuff.\n\n&gt; Stop demanding sequels, stop demanding whole universes of content for stuff. Otherwise companies will just keep pressing the same button that makes money come out without coming up with new stuff.\n\nIt's possible to have sequels which innovate and develop stories further though. Likewise its possible for new games to repeat the same working formula. \n\nI think realistically in this case Hit and Run is a game that has a lot of good but also a lot of bad. Developing the games further and further with a couple of sequels could have resulted in 3 very memorable and good games.\n\nLoved that game\n\nIt's a crime it was never remastered or rereleased or something\n\nI recently came up YT videos of people speed running it and holy crap that was a rabbit hole to fall into lol.\n\nAm i wearing rose-tinted nostalgia glasses? Yes of course they're on! Wouldn't be talking about this game otherwise. There's definitely a way to remake this while keeping the original feel, but making it modern.\n\nSummoning salt is the goat all his speed run vids are interesting to watch\n\nI wish he'd go back to videos less focused on speedrunner personalities. I can't fault the delivery, they're well made, and there are certainly exceptions, but even the rivalries are usually not particularly interesting and the length tends to be a bit more of a marathon too.\n\nI agree but it partially depends on the game. Like, if no new strats are found then the history literally is just who was setting records. There was a video where it chronicled how one player held all the Mario kart records at once or something so it had a narrative.\n\nSummoning Salt is good but imo he really, really cares about *The Scene*™ in a way that I personally don't. After the first 30 minutes of each video, it really seems like they are all \"this guy beat this guy, who then got beat by this guy, until **this other guy** returned!\" and I'm just waiting until he explains the next trick.\n\nSo like the Water Emperor thing in Futurama?\n\nHe's pretty good, but I'd say ThaRixer does it a bit better.\n\nI mean he’s good, but cheesyfartgod69 is a little bit better imo.\n\nI literally have no idea which of these are real\n\nThat’s for you to discover my friend…\n\nTomatoAnus does some good stuff too, but more comedic leaning.\n\nTomato goes in depth on the mechanics of one run and Salt does the history, they’re a good counter to each other.\n\nI really liked ThaRixer until they started doing exclusively videos on Jak and Daxter, a game series I give absolutely no shits about lol.\n\nQuality content, just lost my interest. I'll be back when they cover other games again.\n\nSomeone on YT remastered the game.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/2PBIFunhha4\n\n[deleted]\n\nI really enjoyed watching this series. I’d never heard about this guy before and come across his channel by chance while he was developing the game. I tuned in every episode to see all the updates. He even added some cool stuff to the game like linking all the worlds together into one big map.\n\nthats so cool\n\nI downloaded an emulator and the game on my phone, casted it to my TV, and connected my Xbox remote to my phone it worked fine. I got to 100% it's still a fun game\n\nI hope that guy gets a kidney stone\n\nAgreed, Vivendi would have probably lasted a while longer if they made them.\n\nProbably not. Vivendi is a massive holding company that's still around. A handful of successful Simpsons games would not do *that* much for them.\n\nYeah a few good Simpsons games wouldn’t have moved the needle at all, it’s more that it’s emblematic of their poor business sense to have not made them at no license cost and how decisions like that across the business hurt their subsidiaries. \n\nVivendi owned Blizzard which was a massive powerhouse through the 2000s... especially after they made WoW. That made their gaming division worth multi-billions, and that was probably the first ever game asset to reach that kind of a milestone. So they saw dollar signs upon the success of WoW. In comparison, Simpsons Hit and Run was worth basically nothing - totally agree.\n\nTake it easy Satan.\n\nI just Emulate it on my Steam Deck. I absolutely would have thrown money at a remaster/remake\n\nWhy emulate it? The PC version works far better on Steam Deck than the emulated version. Use the Donut Mod Launcher for near instant load times, any resolution you want, flawless controller support, and lower battery consumption as it's easier to run than an emulator.\n\nYou can also lock the FPS to 60, as the physics is linked to frame rate when it runs at it's native 500fps on modern hardware it's basically unplayable\n\nRan into this issue with Fallout 4 and couldn’t work out wtf was happening haha.\n\nCreation engine moment\n\nHoly shit is there a community for this game? A long time ago I tried just running the original on PC to see if I could get my nostalgia fix real quick but it was a janky unplayable mess. The physics engine was just straight borked. I'll have to look into this again.\n\nThere's a pretty decent modding a speedrun community.\n\nQuite a few decent story mods too\n\nI didn't even know there was a PC version.\n\nI once saw an argument between a Nintendo Switch physical collector and a Steam fiend. The Switch person tried to argue that physical games can \"never be taken away\". The Steamer said \"In 10 years, you'll be able to play all your games in 720p 30fps on your aging Switch. I'll be able to play any of my games on any device I want\".\n\nLeft me shook. We all talk about ownership. Isn't a part of ownership being able to take something with you wherever you go?\n\nPhysical games can very much be taken away. Anything that requires a server or DRM is at risk. \n\nIt sucks game companies don't want to take risks with adult cartoon IPs anymore, besides South Park.\n\nSouth Park stands apart because Trey and Matt have complete control over any game made based off the IP. After the 90s games (South Park and Chef's trivia game) they were so frustrated with how the games came out they locked down control of licensing the IP to video game companies and said no to everyone that wanted to make a game until they themselves had the resources to make the current slate of games.\n\nStick of truth was made by Obsidian with some og fallout devs working it. Like, I'm sure the South Park guys also played a role in its development but that game was pretty much set up to be good.\n\nYou're OP is right* when he says they had complete creative control. Same for SP:TFBW. They oversaw all story elements, dialog, and design. If course they had a game studio make the game but they were 100% at the helm of those games and that was a stipulation for them being made.   Obsidian is a great studio but those games wouldn't be near as good as they are with out Matt and Trey being as involved as they were. They learned their lesson from games prior. Shame that snow day ended up such a poor piece of work.\n\nSpeaking of South Park I still wish we'd get another RPG with that IP. Like I can appreciate they chose to try something different with Snow Day, but it just wasn't as good as Stick of Truth and Fractured But Whole.\n\nWill never understand their choice to go 3d rogue-like. And I _adore_ rogue-likes!\n\nWas FBW as good as SoT? I loved SoT!\n\nYou should play both games if you have the time, FBW is essentially a continuation of the same story that starts in SoT.\n\nI liked the story of SoT better but I preferred the combat in FBW\n\nDid the first game make money?  I know it’s got a cult following on Reddit but was it actually profitable at the time?\n\nits in the PS2 bestsellers list\n\nOh absolutely. That shit sold like 10 million units\n\nIt was basically GTA for kids.\n\nIt was the only version of 'GTA' that was permitted in my household. A cousin bought it for me and I was super stoked. Even with how watered down it was, my parents were still a little miffed simply due to the nature of the game.\n\nI loved it.\n\nI bought it on a whim with my 6th birthday money. I probably put more time into it than Mario Sunshine and Smash Bros. Even as an adult I go back and play it every 4-5 years.\n\nIt released when Simpsons was still only hated by contrarians and GTA was thriving but hadn't yet reached the point of being required gaming for children. It won multiple awards and sold very well for the time. Was rated well by critics and gamers alike, was child friendly but enjoyable enough for adults.\n\n\nIt isn't the greatest game ever made like the fandom will claim but it was an unquestionably successful game in pretty much every measurement. Best Simpsons game isn't hard to claim as they had a lot of bad games worthy of AVGN videos.\n\nThen it's very surprising the bosses at Vivendi turned it down.  Usually bad decisions like that are made by someone simply looking at numbers on a paper and deciding it's not worthwhile.\n\nThat's the wild thing. The only logical reasons to not make a sequel are either abandoning the industry or having artistic integrity that couldn't find an organic story to make. Both of those reasons are entirely invalidated by games released after Hit and Run.\n\n\nPersonally I think it ultimately was for the best not to make a sequel at the time but it does stand out as weird.\n\nNobody in my family ever watched The Simpson and we had the game and played it often.\n\nYeah, but it was also released at a time when developers still had a say in how they choose their projects and not be contracted in to publishing endless sequels every year.\n\nNot enough time to create sequels when you're unethically suing every rival gaming company out there.\n\n[removed]\n\nHot take but it got really repetitive after a while.  \"Go here pick this thing up and drop it off here\"\n\nI don't think it holds up to today's standards but back then it was pretty innovative.\n\nIt’s unfair to compare games in that era to the modern time. Especially when it was a pseudo-open world game. \n\nIf being overly repetitive is its knock then why doesn’t the original Super Mario Brothers game get the same criticism?\n\nI mean it was GTA for kids that parents could let them play without worrying.\n\nWhich naturally is an idea that sold millions.\n\nVivendi almost sunk Valve (and therefore Steam, and therefore PC gaming as we know it) and they prevented us from getting multiple Hit &amp; Run sequels?\n\nFuck that stupid fragrant French company. Va te faire.\n\nI’ll take stupid business decisions for 600, Alex.\n\nSuits ruining everything as usual.\n\nCongratulations “someone at Vivendi Games”, you’ve made an enemy for life\n\nMeh. The armosphere and references were 10/10. \n\nBut that gameplay loop... goddamn.\n\n100%. I recently replayed it for my YT channel with a buddy, and there’s like MAYBE 3 mission types? It starts getting old when you get to Lisa’s level.\n\nI feel like they blew their wad of good show references in the first game though. Kind of like how south park stick of Truth was so much funnier then the second one because they were able to use all of the old references that everybody loves and then FBH was stuck with all the modern stuff that isn’t as iconic. You would have hit and run 2 with a bunch of references that people stopped watching the show when it got bad won’t get or it will just be the same bunch the first game had.\n\nVivendi was also the company that I recently learned lost a key lawsuit to Valve in the early 2000s thanks to that 1 intern that spoke Korean. Vivendi just sucks at business it sounds like.\n\nVery stupid decision. They had a video game franchise that would have basically printed money\n\nI want blood. 🩸\n\nSure the license might have granted them 3 sequels with no additional licensing fee but Vivendi Games was still looking at millions of dollars of developer salaries, facilities costs, marketing costs, manufacturing costs (back when games came on disks), shipping costs, etc. \n\nThe first game was successful enough that a sequel probably would have done well, but let's not pretend like producing the game would have been free.\n\nAfter watching the Half Life 2 documentary, and now seeing this, just adding wood to the \"fuck Vivendi\" pile."

    "all_comment_text": "Great paper, the gaming industry could do more of this publicly\n\nI'm a SysAdmin for a large school district. I stopped telling anyone what I'm doing. Because every single time I told people things, the help desk would get calls with anyone's old problem insisting my upgrade did it. Joke's on them. I didn't do shit. I was pointing out to my director why telling the users every time I made a slight change was lunacy.\n\nI remember way back in the day when we implemented a way to remote in to people's computers to fix things, employees at the remote sites were infuriated. Instead of putting in work orders, they would wait until we showed up on site and pull us off what we came there to do so we could fix their other problems so they didn't have to have their new broken issue sit in a queue for a long time. Once we started fixing everything remotely, all of a sudden none of those other non-documented problems were getting fixed and boy were they pissed. Once they figured out their old process didn't work, they got clever and started using your excuse that the last thing we did broke something else and now just needed to come over and fix it. Now though, everything was documented and we could remotely check on things. They would get even more pissed that we would check to see how long their computer was on when they specifically told us they just rebooted even though we could clearly show them their computer has been on for a month straight. Lie after like, anything they could do to get us on-site. It was a pretty toxic place to work for a while, but they eventually figured out that using the work order system got better results.\n\nPeople put more work into not changing their process than it takes to just change the process and it infuriates me\n\nTo be fair, low and middle level employees are very often not allowed to or not paid enough enough to be changing things in many businesses. I think corporate culture is just as responsible for problems like that as laziness or malice.\n\nI see it all the time where I work. I see these young kids come in with a bunch of ideas to improve the place (I was the same way when i started, as well), then you realize the old geezers higher up will never go for it because they hate change and think their way is the best way. \n\n\nThankfully, I got smart enough not to say anything and just did it without asking and saved myself the pain of them knowing and trying to get me to do it their way. Even impressed the CEO. As much as I wanted to reveal that I did it differently, I knew it would rock the boat.\n\nLot of places seem to encourage the \"easier to ask for forgiveness than ask for permission\" by accident because of these mentalities.\n\nLast 2 places I've worked, if you tried to get permission to do something or make a change, it would sit in red-tape approval purgatory forever. If you just went ahead and did it, you might get questioned for it, but as long as you could show your reasoning and it was done correctly, the higher ups would shrug and mumble \"good job\" under their breath.\n\nOld school sys admin here; when you want it to work do the forgiveness path, you want to kill an impending change do it by the book and let the process kill it.\n\nYup, working \"to the rule\" tends to slow a bunch of shit down, and it's difficult to complain when you are following their process.\n\nHaving been on the other side of this issue, sometimes things are done some way for a reason and that reason is not obvious. I absolutely hate redoing my employees work because they \"figured out a shortcut\" or \"have a new idea\". A lot of this shit has been done before and fucked something up, that's why I showed you exactly how I want it done when you started working.\n\nAnd part of the problem is \"why things are done the way they are done\" is almost never actually explained, it's just \"shut up and do it\" and that generates justifiable natural rebelliousness. High, mid, and low, everyone is guilty of just wanting to \"get through the day\" and not taking the time to do what should actually be done for the best-functioning team mentality.\n\n&gt; And part of the problem is \"why things are done the way they are done\" is almost never actually explained, \n\nThis is why I always ask. Sure there may be a valid reason I'm not aware of or it could have been a valid reason 5 years ago when the system was implemented, but no longer relevant to today. Understanding why gets you far.\n\nthis is a perfect comment- r/optimusfunk i hope you see this response:  you need to foster an environment of your employees bringing you \"shortcuts\" or \"new ideas\" because you want to keep people motivated and keep them thinking and ambitious.  \n\nbut you also don't want them doing shit you know doesn't work.  \n\ni think something that would be great for morale would be to find a long term employee that first thought of that thing and then proved it didn't work, and pair them up with the new person who thought the same way.  great way to make mentors without killing ambition.\n\nYeah this exactly right. You need to teach people the WHY not just the HOW. Otherwise, they can't troubleshoot when things don't go exactly as expected, and they can't find their own, often better way, of doing things.\n\nSooooo.... where you work, you don't explain why things are done the way they are?\n\nIf find when you tell employees the \"why\" even if the answer is just some mundane \"because state regulations say we have to,\" they remember it better and actually do it.\n\nI work in a department where I audit the actual workflow of of our employees, tell them what they do wrong &amp; right. The amount of times see people working harder at not working than if they just did their jobs is actually mind blowing.\n\nIt shouldn't be mind blowing. It's typical human psychology. \n\nDon't forget that all of our technological progress ultimately boils down to the invention of time saving and especially labor saving technology and methods. Ironically if humans didn't put a maximal effort into being lazy we would still be doing basic crop* rotation, with hand operated wooden tools, or we'd be hunter-gatherers still.\n\nYeah, the entire point of our brains is \"work smarter, not harder\" but society's like \"you just reduced the labor to do this by 40%, but I'm still gonna need 9 hours of your life today\".\n\nAnd that much of our current societal system is based on \"employment\", which means that culturally, \"labor-saving\" is a bad thing.\n\n*And that much of our current societal system is based on \"employment\"*\n\nA farce perpetuated by idle wealthy people who do no real labor at all other than annihilating vast amounts of wealth through idiotic political games. \n\n*which means that culturally, \"labor-saving\" is a bad thing.*\n\nObviously. If the poor aren't in a life or death labor race against each other how will the wealthy know who's deserving of trickle down rewards?\n\nA bit more nose than I was going for, but yeah.\n\nI work pretty closely with some mid-level managers at my job. They're all working their asses off all day, just busting their balls to try to get orders completed on time. But the thing is, they could invest a modicum of time into actually *managing* and make sure their direct reports are doing what they're supposed to be doing, and it would make their job 100x easier, and they just won't do it. \n\n\"Oh man, I had to stay 3 hours late last night to make sure the Johnson account got finished.\"\n\n\n\"You know, you could just look at the computer system for 30 seconds each morning, check to see if the milestones for accounts are completed on time, and then follow up with your team if they aren't and then you wouldn't have to give up your nights to do your team's job for them, right?\"\n\n\n\"You want me to do *more* work by actually doing what I'm paid to do in the first place?! I'M WAY TOO BUSY FOR THAT!\"\n\n\n\"K\"\n\nThat's the mentality needed to become a mid-level 'manager'.\n\n&gt;That's the mentality needed to ~~become~~ **stay** a mid-level 'manager'.\n\n**FTFY**\n\nWith so many bad managers out there, any decent one can level up quickly.\n\nMy absolute favorite IT joke will always be:\n\n\"have you restarted recently?\" \n\n\"Yes\"\n\n*Checks*\n\n*Uptime: 48:21:30:11*\n\nTBF shutting down and starting up WAS equivalent to a restart, and now no longer is. \n\n\nBut yes, users are lying little hecks at times.\n\n&gt;wait until we showed up on site and pull us off\n\nBritish slang and a dirty mind made me chuckle.\n\nI am in infosec and we had a director that blamed my testing for everything going wrong.  I started announcing the dates everything would run but not test anything. He started blaming us and I said we haven’t started. It became a running joke with everyone after that. “Must be the testing and not your shop”\n\nYou should have asked him to document everything that went wrong each time, then tell him that you hadn't started.  Then you have a nice, clear paper-trail you can take to his higher-up when it suits you.\n\nSame thing over here in Cybersec. If we perform any change, telling our user base beforehand, suddenly that’s the reason any issue occurs. So now everywhere I work I have my team get the all clear, perform the change, and only mention it down the line whenever it’s an SCCM update and folks are ignoring the restart button for whatever reason.\n\nSame we recently switched to Crowdstrike and users have been calling non stop about some random windows crashes lately. I just tell them to put in a ticket.\n\n/S\n\nI have to inform everyone a week in advance if I want to so much as fart, while cybersec unilaterally deletes software I need to do my job _while I'm using it_.\n\nI'm an audio engineer and used to do live sound.  The amount of times someone will say \"turn c instrument up!\" And then I don't but ask \"is that good?\" And they say \"yea! Way better!\" Is higher than I'd like to admit.\n\nOne studio I worked with had a designated button on the console that was not actually wired to anything it just turned green or red and it made everything better somehow.  Should have done a study on how many people preferred the green sound over the red.  \n\nAlso saw a Neve desk with a really shiny spot near the center, it was where they would pretend to push a non existent button when clients were in the recording room and wanted to watch you push it through the window.   There was no button but from the other side of their tiny angled window it looked convincing.\n\nThe power of the placebo effect!\n\njust like Leland Sklar's \"producer switch\"\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/shorts/KtO3QCagKF4?app=desktop\n\nAs someone with a clip on mic on a mid/low brass in front of monitors, if I can't tell a difference after the request I don't bother pushing it. Either they can't or won't do it, or if they do it any more they risk feedback. Sometimes it's a placebo for people, but for others it's not worth the struggle when you don't know the engineer enough to know how much to trust them.\n\nIn my head I'm always thinking \"It sounds exactly the same, this guy has no idea what I'm asking for.\"\n\nThen out loud I go \"Yeah, that's great\" because I just don't have any interest in arguing with someone non compliant. I almost never work with those people again, so we both win ultimately.\n\nThis is especially true when there's no audio at all but the engineer doesn't believe it. I'll play without monitoring just to not deal with the ego. It's happened at least twice, which is still twice too many.\n\nThe only ones more egotistical than musicians are sound guys. You guys are made for each other.\n\nWell, no, since the sound guys are usually musicians too\n\nSo you actually just get a double-dose of assholery\n\n&gt; And then I don't but ask \"is that good?\" And they say \"yea! Way better!\" \n\nHint: They could tell it sounded *exactly* the same and they just didn't want to keep fighting the dude who controls the sound of their music.\n\n\"Hey can you work with me here to make this show as good as it can be?\"\n\n\"Fuck no. I'm in charge.\"\n\n\"Well okay then.\"\n\nI've watched an A1 get fired for doing that to someone on stage who also was very experienced but the A1 only knew them as an artist.\n\nYep, I agree. I've even seen some people complain about issues that they ALREADY HAD, and blamed them on an update that just happened.\n\nGame developers measure and A/B test everything in every live game constantly. There's really just too much to talk about. \n\nDo you want to know all about how turning a button from blue to green and moving it 10 pixels down improved the first-time use funnel by 0.2%? Or how putting the daily login award screen AFTER the news screen improves 90 day retention by some sliver? Because there are multiple full time jobs dedicated to that sort of thing at live service game companies.\n\nI run operations for a Data Analytics toolchain for a large-ish Bank, so yes this stuff is very interesting to me. These kinds of tweaks to A/B testing are all over the landscape, in real life, and they should be talked about more! More discussion can inspire interesting new ideas cross-functionally.\n\nAt a high level, everything in live service games is captured. Whatever you imagine is being tested, is being tested and optimized. Bigger companies have teams of data scientists for this, but smaller ones make use of turn-key services to help with it.\n\nThat's how things work in theory, but many big businesses (including the fortune 500 I worked for as a data scientist) value the gut feelings of executives over analytics and optimization. People would rather take credit for coming up with mediocre solutions than understand data-driven solutions\n\n[deleted]\n\nI remember watching Asmongold's chat collectively change their opinions as soon as he said something different than what they expected him to say. Was so fucking funny.\n\nI think that with those amounts of viewers you can't really tell if the same people are typing in chat. Might just be that people who agreed with the statement started typing to agree with it. \n\nMight just be he brought up points good enough to change someones mind. But with these kinds of things, you really shoulnd't look at chat. Not a single person has had enough time to buffer and actually think what the points are and how they could be wrong.\n\nOf course it's not the same people.\n\nIt's hilarious when some idiots like the person you responded to try to highlight something as if it's a major gatcha. You'll have the same idiots claim everyone is always unhappy no matter who is elected when in reality it's different people expressing their disapproval LMAO.\n\nSame thing happens on Reddit. People make posts all the time saying stupid shit along the lines of \"why was everyone hating this thing yesterday and suddenly today you all love it\".  It's cause it was different people you idiots.\n\nThe loud gets quiet and the quiet gets loud. Pretty normal occurrence in this setting.\n\nAsmongold and Hasan chat have no opinion on their own they just like to parrot yep\n\n90% of Hasan's streams are him bitching at his chat lmfao\n\nYeah, at the one dissenting voice, who gets piled on by the entire rest of the chat as well. And is likely to be banned extremely soo. He has cultivated an incredibly conformist community.\n\nLmao Hasan is always fighting with his chat.\n\nyea the issue is just those two channels.\n\nLiterally every stream ever. People just like being part of the show. I'm sure those same people would be able to put up points why the streamers are wrong. But there is no point in doing that.\n\nTwitch is not really the place to gauage out how stupid people are.\n\nAlso possible that they're different groups of people lumped into \"chat\"\n\nGoogle \"asmongold dead rat alarm clock\" and \"asmongold bedroom\", and then \"asmongold cockroach\". Then recoil in horror as you slowly realise that THIS is someone for whom who tens of thousands of people lean off their every word.\n\nI don't think you need to google any of those things to see the squalor he lives in. Not only is much of it on screen, but he's up front about how much of a slob he is and he's cleaned out his bin of rotten food on camera before. It's part of his draw, that he's the quintessential male gamer stereotype. Disgusting living space, doesn't shower, subsists on junk food, lives in his (late) mother's house, has a body pillow of his waifu...\n\nE: To the guy who thinks I made up the bit about the body pillow: his fans literally sent him one of Y'shtola. It's in one of his mail videos. He opened it and laughed before moving on to the next package.\n\nI had never once heard of the man until he decided to play a game I enjoyed, singlehandedly destroying the servers and saturating the community with his followers.\n\nWhen I decided to look up who this guy was I was VERY confused. I thought I had the wrong person, could not figure out how somebody like this could move such an army of blind fanatics.  \nHonestly I still don't understand it.\n\n[deleted]\n\nSo a career politician, then?\n\nCloser to a radio talk show host.\n\nThis sub was against SBMM everytime the topic popped up, it's not just streamers, people remember good times in COD4 and such and think they will actually still have fun if they brought back all the jank and limitations of that time.\n\nThe reason the \"good old days\" of video games is gone is due to metagaming, not SBMM. SBMM is an attempt to mitigate the consequences of metagaming on the game's playerbase. Streamers account for a major portion of the blame for metagaming being so prevalent to begin with.\n\nI see thread of people asking what the most \"meta\" build is for *single-player* games. People are thoroughly optimizing the fun out of their games and then complaining video games aren't fun anymore.\n\nAnd they forget even back then there was SBMM but everybody was ass so didnt matter LOL\n\nYou weren't forced to search for a new lobby each game back then unlike current CoD\n\n[deleted]\n\nOverwatch used to have it and I really liked it.  \nIt was fun staying with roughly the same group. You actually got to talk a bit.  \nI want to believe that it made players think of each other more as actual real humans and that it reduced toxicity.  \nA few years after release, most people would just instantly leave the lobby after the match ended and requeue for some reason. It wasn't even faster than just staying.  \nOf course the remainder of the lobby was usually too small which made the matchmaker just disband the lobby instead of trying to fill the spots.  \nI don't think that feature exists anymore. As far as I remember, you'll just automatically get kicked out into the main menu after each and every match now...\n\n[edit] forgot to write down the main thing I wanted to say:  \nI wish more games had persisting lobbies, but I would be surprised if players behaved differently than in this example.\n\nThat's the real difference here. You would get a lobby and stay in a lobby. Now you get a random mix at all times.\n\n[deleted]\n\nMy hypothesis that I will decline to test is that people who post in forums are more likely to be better players, and so removing SBMM *does* make them more likely to play against worst opponents.\n\nI have no doubt that people who are above average do enjoy matches without SBMM more, but most players are not above average, and so SBMM improves the experience for most of the players who don't frequent forums\n\nFrom my experience, the people who bitch about SBMM are usually higher tier players who simply want to turn their brain off and stream roll.\n\nThat they have happen to them what they do to others doesn't register in their pea brain and they whine abour always having to be 'on' like they deserve their kills.\n\nTurns out facing them with similar skill level is 'sweaty' when they don't realize how much they sweat\n\nThat’s because normally streamers are above average by a bit of a margin. And they just want to beat up newbies so they can look good and not tilt. If they had SBMM they get upset cause they have to play the game. \n\nBingo. Back in the day we called it pub stomping. All the good players played on private invite only servers, any of those people that joined a random public server would wipe the floor with everyone \n\nI been saying this streamers are a cancer to gaming just like micro transactions but their cult like following always come to the defence\n\nNo real surprise here. I think xDefiant points out that no SBMM is ok or even fun (for a while) for people on the right side of the distribution curve but sucks the bottom 40-50% who statistically will be cannon fodder and quit. \n\nI think it's overall worse for the bottom 50 and the top 10-20. Either you're constantly losing or never challenged. \n\n[removed]\n\nAh yes, the age-old dichotomy of \"How dare they make this game more appealing to new players!\" followed by \"This game is dead why aren't we getting any new players?\"\n\nAhh, the old Destiny 2 philosophy.\n\nI argued with so many people on SBMM. \"We just want to relax when not playing ranked, it's such a sweat fest with SBMM.\" Oh yeah, at whose expense?\n\nIn general, I like Aztecross and what be brings to the Destiny 2 edutainment talking head space for the game. But when he started to rail on SBMM and how Crucible was just for people to go and chill and not sweat, I stopped watching his content. He was out of touch and not a little bit insulting.\n\nThe only destiny cruicible streamer that wasn't railing against SBMM was cammy cakes, because cammy and drewskie are so far above the rest of the content creators they aren't a real challenge for them.\n\nCammy was fully in the camp of wanting the challenge, and wanting the difficulty but the rest of the creator sphere told him he was so wrong he gave up on trying to improve the game with his platform and just stomps the crap out of top 1% people now.\n\n\"yea, how dare all these new players not want to suffer for 6 years like i had to in this game thats been out for 6 years to get to my skill level! for this game thats no longer getting any updates!\"\n\nTrials of osiris in destiny 2 had this problem: essentially it had massive population decay issues because the bottom 10% would drop out completely each week and never come back, so the mode just kept getting harder and harder to play until even the tryhard players were complaining about it being too sweaty\n\nTrials by design can never be successful unless it gives worthwhile loot to the fodder for engaging with it.\n\nAlso important to point out for people who don't play destiny, Trials is a unique PvP mode of 3v3 where the goal is to win 7 games without losing. Winning 7 games or going flawless will then get you to the lighthouse for the best rewards. You can see how this is a pretty flawed (heh) designed game mode because winning 7 games in a row of anything is extremely rare. Or only the very best players can ever realistically achieve it.\n\nBungie has constantly tried to rework Trials to be more welcoming and rewarding to less skilled players. There have been mixed results with some success and some failure to increase the player pool. But as long as the main goal of the mode is to win 7 and go flawless, it's going to continue having the same design problems.\n\nThe only real knock against SBMM is when the system prioritizes SBMM&gt;Stable connection, especially in a P2P situation vs playing on a dedicated server.\n\nI think most people will agree that playing with/against players of similar skill level is when the game feels best, but when you’re playing at insanely high pings as a result because the game is pulling players with poor connections to keep the matchmaking fair, it can ruin the game for everyone in the lobby.\n\nIt can also be over tuned to the point winning a game feels like a pitty throw or doing good one game results in markedly worse game next as it tries to adjust your matching to aggressively\n\nYup in Halo Infinite the SBMM has already predicted whether you'll win or lose before the match begins.\n\nIf you go to the Halo Waypoint site, log in, go to your Service Records (top right menu) and navigate to Stats &gt; Summary, you'll get a nice graph of your last 20 games which also shows the PREDICTED kills/deaths and how they line up with how you actually played. And it's usually pretty close!\n\nHuh, so they clearly knew my dumbass teammate that went 0/11 in a slayer and cost us the game was gonna do that. Interesting.\n\nCan't predict someone having to let another person playing. If my wife tried to play CoD on my profile she'd quit after the first game. SBMM has pretty much killed our ability to play shooters together.\n\nThe system was/is flawed in that to get a balanced game, it would pull a few great players and then lower the expected win rate by drafting the worst players in queue to fill the rest of the slots. It didn’t average to get the lobby as close to together as possible skill wise, it basically calculated how many kills on bad players a team’s carry could farm per minute. This meant better players had crazy inflated kill numbers because it kept matching them against teams with a carry and some easy picks, it is a bad feedback loop that is also technically speaking still accurate data.\n\nMicrosoft big data basically figured out how to balance skill imbalances by making it more unbalanced predictably.\n\n[deleted]\n\nGoes to show the level of amnesia the community seems to exhibit. \n\nEveryone acted like getting rid of SBMM would solve everything but the situation with xDefiant is nothing new. That’s exactly how things worked before the days of SBMM. The bottom 50% would get stomped on, players would quit, the new bottom 50% of players would now be the ones getting stomped on, and more players quit.\n\nAnd the top 50% gets more experience and stomps even harder and the new players get stomped quicker and leave quicker.\n\n\nAnd people wonder why private lobbies were such a big deal among friends\n\nUmm… what’s SBMM?\n\nEdit: thanks everyone! Wow, I this is a pretty innocuous comment ti be getting so many upvotes\n\nSkill Based Match Making\n\nAnd this is a reminder that SBMM  is very different from systems like group ELO MMR like what you find in games like league of legends. \n\n\nThis is because SBMM will presumably use your individual performance within its' metrics and put less weight on the groups win and loss. ELO MMR from League does (or did?) not use your individual performance or puts the majority of output on the win/loss of the team. Obviously that's not very effective with randomized teams *unless* you play an obscene amount of games where it may(or may not) level off for you individually. \n\n\n\nSBMM &gt; ELO in randomized team games.\n\nIt’s true that your ELO may fluctate due to team’s performance but stating that it takes an “obscene amount of games” to reach appropriate ELO is completely wrong. Either you are misinformed or coping. Pros and smurfs time and time again climb the ladder in just a few games with the occasional dry period from tough luck in matchmaking. We’re talking 20-50 games should normally bring you near your true ELO and within 100 it’s almost guaranteed to be accurate. It’s hard to call that an “obscene amount”.\n\nObviously it would improve the ranking system if the game was able to measure individual performance and add that to rating calculation, but the way you present its accuracy is extremely misleading. The only common denominator between multiple games is yourself so it will ALWAYS level off and that is a tough pill for some players to swallow.\n\nSuper Bash Mothers Melee\n\nSomeone being brave enough to ask for an acronym to be defined deserves the upvotes.\n\nAlso means anyone else with the same question can find the answer.  Double win.\n\nIt used to be common writing courtesy to fully write out whatever was going to be abbreviated the first time\n\nOr name which game a post is specifically about\n\nafaik, op cba 2 tl;dr...  IOW: op dc 2 'splain.\n\nThis is the human equivalent of a zip bomb.\n\nTrying to unpack it definitely stalled my brain.\n\n“As far as I know, the original poster can’t be bothered (arsed) to write a “too long, didn’t read” section. In other words, the original poster didn’t care to explain properly.”\n\nThe fuck is a zip bomb.\n.. what do you **fucking** people MEAN?!\n\n.zip is a common compressed file type, which is basically achieved by finding common sequences of bits and using a shorter form to express them.\n\n\nFor a period of time, decompression programs hadn't accounted for malicious uses. After all, they were originally only used to compress existing files.\n\n\nBut knowledge of the filetype allows some people to edit the .zip itself, so that a little innocent-looking file can carry the instructions to generate an obscenely large file which hadn't existed originally.\n\n\nLike, hey: write three trillion 1's to your hard drive.  If software isn't prepared to refuse this, then bad things would happen, so sending zip-bombs was a type of cyberattack.\n\nTranslation for those whose english is not a first language:\n\nAs far as I know, Original Poster can't be arsed to give \"too long; didn't read\"... in other words, Original Poster doesn't care to explain.\n\nI came to the comments just to find out what sbmm was. In scholarly papers, you're required to write out what the acronym is the first time you use it. I didn't realize until social media became big that this wasn't done everywhere.\n\nAnnoyingly the term is not in the paper itself either, making it even more confusing.\n\nSkill based matchmaking.\n\nIts become a bit of a boogeyman in games as they can be implemented incredibly poorly.\n\nIts essentially the word for \"hidden MMR\" or \"hidden rank\" but also in casual play, and is used to match you closer to the same skill level of player.\n\nThe benefits are that fights should be closer and more balanced, leading to a better gameplay experience.\n\nBut the negatives are that its often perceived as \"if you do better you fight vs better, so you can never try anything new because you will just get trounced\"\n\nand it can be implemented far too aggresively which it did in one of the reason COD games, where it was so swingy you would go 30 - 2 because you played vs noobs, and then next game you went 2 - 30 because it kicked you up so hard, and then kicked you down again.\n\nRecently most famously xDefiant has sold itself as being \"No skillbased matchmaking, everyone is just mixed\" which was praised as it was a \"more fun casual mode\", but im not sure what the outcome of that was due to how many other problems the game faced.\n\nThe people afraid of it are just bad at math and think everyone deserves to win over 50% of the time. \n\nMy interpretation is people mad about it are the same people that make non-ranked accounts just to beat up on casual gamers.\n\nYea thats exactly my thought. Those try hards invest a lot of time but get upset because they keep getting matched against other try hards. So their time investment doesnt pay off in the way they want. Thats why they do things like make smurf accounts. So it stands to reason they dont like SBMM. \n\n Any game i ever played that releases without good SBMM has sucked major ass until they add or fix it. No one playing casually wants someone in their game that plays it like a full time job. Its hilarious to me that they also dont want other people like them in their own games.\n\nExactly! I mean they’re literally saying in this thread that’s what they want!\n\nI think its one of the many problems of hidden game design that everyone knows is there but they just dont admit.\n\nLeague of legends has fairly recently added your \"Hidden MMR score\" to your profile so its visible for you, and you can get a decent idea what its trying to throw you against, but people get mad when their number goes lower, so thats why its hidden most of the time.\n\nI think it leads to better games that its there, but its also much harder to get good games if your mmr are wildly varied, i remember playing R6 many many years ago with some online friends who were super good at it and i felt worthless at the game, only occasionally doing okay, and then when i played alone where my mmr was actually supposed to be i did so much better, and even outperformed.\n\nBut it took months for me to realize that is what happened as i was never told about it ingame.\n\nAs opposed to in the same scenario assuming no skill based matchmaking and the teams were more varied i might have hit more teams where i did well against and more where i got wrecked.\n\nBut i have my own hate boner for how poorly games handle premades vs non premades and thats an entirely different can of worms.\n\nEDIT: turns out what i was told was league mmr was just the total score of your challenges added to your profile, mb\n\nYeah I noticed that as well when I'd play PUBG with my more skilled friends, they'd be popping heads left and right and I'd be getting trounced, whereas if I played solo I'd have an easier time. I don't think there's any other way to do it though.\n\n&gt;but people get mad when their number goes lower,\n\nSee people are dumb. That number going down makes it more likely you’ll win in later matches. \n\nMyeah well.\n\nThere is a huge ego problem of people not understanding that the reason a rank in a videogame is impressive is because the rank is meant to reflect the skill level, but so many just chase higher ranks without becoming better, so they call it things like \"elo hell\" when they refuse to improve but wont rise in rank because they lose games.\n\nThese types of people wants to get all the recognizition with none of the hard work, which just isnt how it works.\n\nSee gamers almost admit that they want to be lied to. \n\nIf a game was designed fo just lie and shower then with false praise and a false rank I bet they would complain a lot less. Until they figured out they were being lied too. \n\nFrankly I think the whole lot of them needs to be placated by a computer telling them they’re a big man number. \n\nThat's why I respect the hell out of games that will give you real ranks that go up and down based on your performance (Rocket League and CSGO are the ones I'm most familiar with and have played the most. Rocket league has an animation showing your rank actually going down, it hurts to see but man it you know you need to improve when you do,)\n\nIn classic wow PVP (2019-2020) I found great joy as a rogue from attacking people at full hp that were  2+ levels higher than me and winning. I would still lose sometimes but I was fine with that because the challenge and thrill of potentially winning fights I shouldn't be winning was enjoyable. I found no joy in attacking people at 50% hp or lower level than me, i.e. where I'd be dramatically favored anyway. \n\n=\n\nI later learned that the bulk of people found their joy in dominating people significantly lower leveled than them, and engaging in unfair 4v1 (etc) fights. When I would question some people why they would do this they would attribute it to their own skill and prestige as if playing like this meant they were a good player because they were winning and winning = skillful player. This taught me that, IMO, though people don't like to admit it, many/most of them do want their own little power fantasy and to win win win even if the fight is not fair at all.\n\nBut it is a part of design to make sure even the dumb people get along, *especially* if they are the majority.\n\nIf you show someone their skill level, and then they can see it decreasing... that's just a really bad thing to see for most humans.\n\nThat's why a lot of games have a ranking system that is more based on time played than your actual MMR. For example the ranking in MTG Arena where you rank up from wins but don't downrank from losses up to Silver, and get 2x points up from a win and only 1 point down from a loss up to Platinum\n\nSuper Brash Mrothers Melee\n\nSuper Big Mommy Milkers\n\nhonestly, it was a bad choice for op to abbreviate it in the title. i dont think ive seen sbmm before.  \n\n\ni've seen \"skill based mm\", and i'm well aware of it being a longtime cs player... ive just never seen it called sbmm. it took me a minute.\n\nI'm so tired of unnecessary random acronyms\n\nI mind them less when they're defined first use. And I mean first use per post, not in a community. I will not go hunting for what your acronym means, I will just skip the post.\n\nDon't you know how Reddit works? When faced with an unknown acronym, you have to either play a word game to try to find the right answer, or you have to Google it. Basically OP's laziness in not wanting to write 2-5 goddamn words results in 5 times more work *for every single person* who reads the comment and doesn't know the acronym beforehand.\n\nIt's even worse because the article OP linked doesn't mention SBMM a _single_ time. It doesn't even put the words \"skill based matchmaking\" together, anywhere in the article.\n\nMy biggest issue is that I have a hidden rank. I want to know where I stand to even know if I am improving. Unfortunately, letting players know that are barely functional potatoes doesn't sell games.\n\nHidden rank makes too much sense to me.\n\nGo back a few years to games that have score boards and you’ll see why. It’s no fun knowing you’re 2,398,124th place on the board. And the top 10,000 players have scores so high they’re obviously cheating.\n\nBut if by rank you mean gold silver or bronze I think that’s reasonable.\n\nUnfortunately basically everyone who can't climb out of bronze will just quit your game\n\nWasn’t league ranked (not counting accounts with no ranked games) like 50% of players in iron/bronze before they added emerald to smooth out the rank distribution?\n\nOnly bottom 5% were Iron, but yeah like 65% of players were bronze or silver\n\nLeague has a *lot* of people in Bronze / Iron\n\nThe whole backlash against SBMM is people repeating the things that streamers say. High level players grow entitled to feeling like they should absolutely dominate games and play against lower tier players. So they bitch about games that put them against similarly great players - suddenly they can't have rounds where they have 30 kills to 0 and they blast SBMM and everyone repeats it.\n\nNo one seems to understand that in order for one person to go 30-0 with ease, 30 other people are not having a good time.\n\nA common argument you'll hear from them is \"I want to be able to relax [and win easily]. I don't want every game to be some sweaty struggle just to win\" but ffs, having to do your best to win is exactly the right level of competition. You aren't entitled to half-ass a game and still win easily anyway. There's necessarily another human being on the other end of that situation that essentially has zero chance to win no matter how hard they try.\n\nOf course people like SBMM. The only people who don't are on the top 10-20% of player skill and want other human players to essentially be like NPCs they can beat up on. It's not fun for the \"NPCs\" to get crushed easily.\n\n“I don’t want to play against sweats” — person playing 14 hours a day\n\nBut how else are they going to make that incredible montage video where they get those sick headshots constantly?! /s\n\nIt's also really funny because guess what happens if you don't tryhard with sbmm? Your MMR goes down and your games are good again quickly!\n\n“I just wanna have a chill relaxed match (but still win and go 2:1, its unacceptable for me to lose or go negative)”\n\nThe ven diagram of people who hate SBMM and have main character syndrome is a circle.\n\nI hate it for exactly 1 reason. I'm ass at shooters. Since MW4 came out, like 20 years ago, I've never eclipsed a .75 kdr in any shooter I've ever played. With SBMM I can not group with my friends because our levels are too skewed. I can either play solo and maintain my humble 7-10 average, or I can play with them and go 2-24.\n\nNow we just skip the misery and play helldivers\n\nEdit: I'm glad people like it. I'm glad SBMM is enjoyable for other people. Online shooters just aren't for me anymore and that is okay. Not everything needs to be catered to my wants or desires. I don't want SBMM to go away. Y'all don't need to try and convince me. I support your enjoyment! The medium has just evolved past my desire to participate. And that's okay.\n\nTry hell let loose. It equalizes the playing field, everybody gonna die a lot k/d for infantry is ignored as it’s almost always negative. Being at the objectives when you need to is what wins the game.\n\nHLL is disturbingly fun.  It's so real, but it's of course a game.  Always recommend.\n\nA lot of veteran players lovingly call it “the ptsd simulator”.\n\nIt helps that the teams have a hundred players on them so the system would have to try very hard to create an unbalanced match.\n\n&gt;Now we just skip the misery and play helldivers\n\ncracked the code 👌 \n\nI used to play competitive twitch shooters when I was younger, now that I can't compete, I either play slower shooters or just PvE games.\n\nAnother hero of Democracy I see.\n\nTo your Hellpod, Helldiver!\n\nThe funny thing is, the data in the paper shows that when SBMM is relaxed, 90% of the playerbase leaves more games and plays less overall. There is no way only the top 10% are the people complaining, the majority of the people who hate SBMM would absolutely have a worse experience without it.\n\nYou're forgetting the part where most people think they are way, way, way better at a game than they are.\n\nI know I'm in Bronze, but that's just because of shitty teammates. I'd be in Diamond if I got anybody who could actually play on my team.\n\nLmao thats the attitude fr.\n\nWhat's funny is that all 5 people on that bronze team are saying the same thing.\n\nApex subreddit every single day (its my teammates that are holding me back)\n\nThey think that relaxing sbmm will allow them to dunk on noobs, not realizing that they themselves will become noobs to be dunked on.\n\nI'll have one match a night that I'll call my good match. After that, everything is downhill.\n\nI wonder how much of this is due to an entire generation of players having being in sbmm their entire lives. They're accustomed to *apparently* not sucking. \n\n\nIf players were used to having a wide skill mismatch in games (and losing more often) like they used to be,  would they still ragequit as much?\n\nIf only SBMM was the biggest thing that made parroting others a problem in our society. We'd be living in a utopia. Instead, with more information than ever before, we have large groups of people who refuse to listen, just spouting nonsense. SBMM only fails in games that are too small to find decent matches. In any game with a big enough player base, it's a main reason for longevity. The players who would otherwise get stomped, often get challenging competitive games.\n\nIf you want to see dominance watch eSports. It happens regularly. Entertaining streamers are much more fun for casual play.\n\nNot even the top 10-20%, it's probably a much lower percentage like 3%.\n\nenemy team has 2kd average and my team has 2kd average. but i have 5kd and my teammates struggle breathing and moving the mouse at the same time.\n\nI think people forget how variable performance can be. You see this kind of complaint in chess ALL the time, even though it's not a team-based game at all and the player ratings are super transparent. \"I can't believe a 1200 player found these great moves!\" \"I can't believe a 2100 player made a 1 move blunder!\"\n\nYeah, they did. And it's normal. Sometimes people have a good game, sometimes they have a bad game. Furthermore, there are lots of reasons why people can be assigned a certain rating. Maybe they're technically strong, but not fast enough. Maybe they're good at the opening, but bad at calculating. Maybe they take big risks that pay off sometimes and blow up other times. Maybe they move super fast and fluster other inexperienced players, but lose when they face someone who has seen their shit before.\n\nAny given matchup can result in one player feeling like they're better than their teammates or worse than their teammates, but you might very well have the same MMR and just suck in different ways, or be having a bad day. The system can't guarantee all players will perform equally well in all matchups. It's just a heuristic based on overall performance.\n\nAnd God help you if you wanna party up with friends of varying skill-levels\n\nThis is what's ruined it for me and my friends. I'm significantly better than all but 1 friend at these fps' and then he's significantly better than me. So when me and him played together I got drug up to his lobbies and while it was tough,  we managed.  But if ever wanted to do more than duos, it became a total disaster. Friends were just too bad to handle the sbmm. And now instead of it being 1 or 2 dudes in the lobby tearing them up,  it was every fucking person.\n\nThis is kind of what happened with a friend of mine. I'm decent at shooters, he's amazing at them, and his other friend is amazing at them as well. Our other friends aren't great. \n\nWe tried playing valorant- I was brand new, but I was being put in lobbies with their skill level, and couldn't even *attempt* to learn how to play.\n\nSo, they made an alt account and played with their own personal handicaps to make it more chill for all of us.\n\nBut.. what ended up happening is we started only being matched against other smurf players on obvious alts.\n\nThis isn't specifically SBMM but rather treating players as an aggregate team, which is almost always bad unless the team is a prestack. This is a huge problem with modern game design. It's trivial to rate players based on their personal performance, but companies would rather patent their matchmakers to try to sell lootboxes to children than make good matches.\n\ntl;dr Rate players as individuals, put individuals with similar rating together, and quarantine prestacks to be aggregated as a group and put against other prestacks also aggregated as a group. Matchmakers and rating systems have been solved for 30 years.\n\nThis is the part of the argument people happily gloss over or blatantly ignore. It's not the SBMM that's the biggest issue since it can be tuned different in and out of casual or ranked gamemodes. It's also an issue that a lot of SBMM complainers fail to recognize mind you.\n\nIt's the fucking grotesque lobby balancing that takes place in casual gamemodes to try and equal out the teams so if you're a good player you're essentially tasked with dragging a bunch of anchors across a beach.\n\nIt's not equal skill distribution. It's trying to create a \"fair\" match so good players become outliers and constantly end up in situations where they are flat out expected to carry by the lobby algorithm.\n\nAs someone else said as well it becomes a nightmare to queue up with buds unless your buds are also good players.\n\nI tried to play COD the other day when I saw it was on  Game Pass, I haven't played any games in the series since the one with Kevin Spacey, which I only played the campaign, and I haven't played the MP since Black Ops 1. So I am not good at it to say the least. I decided to play some rounds and every game I was in, I was the only person who was level 2 and everyone else was 600+. I immediately start getting verbally abused for being new, and then doubly so when I only got one kill the whole game.\n\nI uninstalled it after like 4 games. I dunno what a normal new player experience is like for that game but that was genuinely just... not fun.\n\nGotta love when you get thrown into a match and lose horribly, check the stats after and basically see the SBMM going \"Bro why didn't u carry?\"\n\nIt's an interesting paper, i read it, but... i'm just too old. I was used to server browser with lists, where you could join a server in titles like UT99 or Q3A. But there was a serious advantage, not related to SBMM, it was that we could set up dedicated servers and use these for clan wars etc.\n\nThat's a thing, the old titles still work because you can join servers per IP. No main servers are needed. For newer titles, once the main servers are offline, you can't play the game anymore.\n\nCommunity servers also policed bad actors or had servers deliberately for them so invasive anti cheat that is a bad update away from crowdstriking players wasnt required. But publishers had less control to push mtx and otherwise control the player base so clearly it had to go.\n\nAlso playing on servers like this allows you to maintain the players as you move from map to map. In a modern game like say Halo infinite the match is over in less than 10 minutes. There is no chatting, no map change, everyone instantly queue next and no one will see eachother ever again. Playing a game with a server browser you can stay playing with the same people for an extended period of time. This allows you to actually determine your skill level compared to others. Also you can try and get revenge on the player that dominated the last game. If you get completely destroyed you can say \"just a bad game\" because you actually have a chance to redeem yourself against the same competition.\n\nThis is the difference between holding down the pool table at the local bar because you are playing well, or going to a new bar with new players for every single game.\n\n&gt;There is no chatting, no map change, everyone instantly queue next and no one will see eachother ever again. Playing a game with a server browser you can stay playing with the same people for an extended period of time\n\nI think that's why CS (&amp; DoD) had such a huge impact 25ish years ago). Chatting while waiting for the next round, and you started to get to know the people on your favourite servers. There was a sense of (banter &amp; trash talking) community, and it felt less toxic than many online communities do today.\n\nI don't understand why most modern games abandoned private open servers to custom host games.  I played in a league in Team Fortress Classic and before I was on a team I had 3-5 servers bookmarked and you would quickly learn the regulars, which led to friends, which led to teams/clans, which led to community.  I feel like it's harder to develop those communities now without those dedicated servers.  Was the social aspect just replaced by Discord?\n\nI've always felt that publishers abandoned dedicated servers and self-hosted games because they can't turn those off. The only way to get players to move to a sequel was to *actually make the sequel better.*\n\nBy forcing everyone to use publisher-hosted matchmaking servers they can shut them off and the community either plays the new game or doesn't play. Now the publishers can force devs to pump out annual rehashes with fewer features and more MTX.\n\nFew things to note\n\n1. **They did not measure whether people liked the changes**. They measured whether players returned more often after 14 days, of which it was assumed that if people played the game less that means they disliked the changes\n2. **They did not remove SBMM**. They loosened the strength of SBMM over a period. However players were still ultimately matched based on skill, just not as strongly\n3. **They should do this same test but this time start without SBMM and gradually increase the strength  of SBMM, and observe whether the results are the same or different.** This is important because what they could actually be observing is that people dislike that there was a change at all, not that they necessarily disliked what it changed into\n\n&gt; They should do this same test but this time start without SBMM and gradually increase the strength of SBMM, and observe whether the results are the same or different. This is important because what they could actually be observing is that people dislike that there was a change at all, not that they necessarily disliked what it changed into\n\nThey actually did that as well, and got consistent results - the bottom 20% of players loved it, everyone but the top 10% at least liked it.\n\nI dislike SBMM when it’s like MW2 launch.\n\nAfter a good game or 2 I went from people who play normal to adderall snorting b-hop cornerstrafing pixel peek masters who move like they are using a Cronus or XIM\n\nI liked how halo reach and 4 handled it, definitely SBMM\n\nYeah that's fair we can all shit on bad implementation.\n\nSBMM has never been the problem. The problem is that games like COD don’t use true SBMM. In COD they’ll purposely put you in games where you out level people so you crush the other team and do well. Then a match or two later they’ll put you in a game where you’re a lower level than everyone else and get destroyed. They purposely have these high and low matches because it keeps people playing longer. Casual players don’t like being put in even matched games and tend to stop playing after only a few rounds\n\nThere's some games out there that, without sbmm, the games skill gap would be comical.\n\n- Rocket League, a GC player vs. bronze players, those bronze players aren't even touching the ball lol\n\n- Overwatch the bronze players aren't getting a kill\n\n- Valorant and CS they might get a lucky headshot. They go 1-15 k/d at best.\n\nI could go on, but I think there's just a severe disconnect with some players. They don't realize that for the bottom 50% of player, statistically, SBMM is HELPING them. \n\nIn addition to that, the higher level players *should* want to play against players within their skill range. What fun is it playing a rocket league game where the opponent can't touch the ball...\n\nThe ONLY players a lack of SBMM would benefit is high level players who want to beat up on noobs\n\nThe paper showed that for the bottom 80%, SBMM is helping them have a more fun time. (not just the bottom 50%).\n\nSBMM is a necessity for any multiplayer game worth its salt. Yes better players enjoy stomping noobs but even then only for so long. Noobs need as much help onboarding as possible, especially if the game has a sharp learning curve (which invariably most multiplayer games have since it's determined by the avg playerbase skill). So SBMM is better for everyone except gronks who just wanna stomp noobs. \n\nThe big problem is shady EOMM that's trying to keep you addicted and mainlining whatever game has it. Especially since no company, publisher or producer will ever be honest about it. Not like they can say \"hey we track your stats and give you occasional free wins timed perfectly to stop you from rage quitting\". I guarantee it's in many games already but it's difficult to prove outright, despite many people having anecdotal evidence.\n\nRobert Bowling basically said as much. SBMM existed in COD4 but not like or how it's evolved into today's COD.\n\nAnd even then there was still a server browser. You could play outside the confines of SBMM if you wanted to.\n\nAlways walking a fine line between knowing the systems playing you and being a full blown conspiracy nut. \nRemember when games were fun and not cash grabs.\n\nIt's been around forever.\n\nI remember thinking my older brother smashing controllers and getting mad at Tecmo Superbowl on the NES because \"the game is cheating!\"\n\nEnded up later that, yeah, the coding would change some stats on the NPCs and it would.. cheat.\n\nIt struck me when I found out about that, because he would rage in the early 90's about it, and eventually it turned him off from gaming completely. He just couldn't trust it for a fair game so he gave up. \n\nWe always thought he was just too touchy and just sucked at the game, but it was just.. someone trying to have fun that was getting cheating out of it.\n\nIf they are going to insist that sbmm/eomm is better for everyone then they should at least let you see your MMR/ skill ranking number. \nSeems like that would solve the majority of issues people have with the current system.\n\nNot really, there is a reason why so many players do not play ranked. Some like to think they are better than they actually are, having a rank would destroy that illusion, some hate the pressure of having a visible rank, and so on.\n\nYes the system behind it does essentially the same, but showing it to the players or not makes a difference in how it is perceived.\n\nI like it that they released such a paper, but CoD's SBMM (or maybe EOMM, I have no clue at this point) since MW19 always felt like it was full of shit IMO, so I am full of doubt as to whether \"SBMM works\" is a good way to put this.\n\nIn MW19 and BOCW, I'd either get absolute noobs who never touched a PC/Console in their lives or I'd get a team full of shit bucket sweatlords where I could barely do anything without trying to become a sweatlord myself and thus taking away all fun and enjoyment from the game, nothing inbetween, and it was blatantly visible when you reverse boosted or if you had a good or sweatlord puinishment match, and my lifetime K/D was always stuck on almost exactly 1, as the braindead games and sweatlord games effectivelly cancel eachother out.\n\nCoD is the only case where I observed anything like this, any other multiplayer game that I played without such SBMM, I am either doing consistently great, or if I have a bad day or if the enemy is much better than I am then I logically shit the bed, or I am consistently mediocre because I myself lack the skill in a given game."

    "all_comment_text": "one thing i do love of old assassins creed is hanging off a pier when tailed by multiple enemies and watching them all jump in the water and instantly dying.\n\nNever gets old\n\nDon't get me wrong, I loved that but even better was when during tailing mission 30 the enemies would stop and stare at your direction and be stuck there until you force it to restart.\n\nok that never happened to me and i played up to AC 3 so my condolences to you\n\nI'm playing through them right now, currently near the end of Revelations. I've definitely had to restart missions or forfeit full synch because NPCs refuse to move. This happens in all of the Ezio games.\n\nLike you need to stand within 10ft of the guy you're protecting, but neither he nor the enemy 100ft away will move, so the quest doesn't progress.\n\nMaybe this is a recent Ezio Collection bug? I played the ezio games like, 50 times each as a kid (I had no friends) and even once recently and have never encountered this bug.\n\ncurrently playing the ezio collection, i just finished 2 with about 60 hours and it was a pile of shit sometimes. i had exactly the same glitches with the tailing missions a heartbreaking amount of times but i also had issues with ezio catching ledges after you get the jump upgrade, and the counter timing felt off but that was probably a skill issue\n\nNah, it happened during the OG trilogy. Rarely, but it did happen. At least, rarely, for me. And other people, per the comments.\n\nYeah I've done 100% on AC2 and Brotherhood and actually in the middle of working on Revelations now, the original Steam versions, not Ezio Collection, and I think I've had to restart a bugged mission maybe 2 or 3 times total in hundreds of hours.\n\nThat's a classic in old GTA. Get 5 stars and then drive to the edge of that unfinished bridge and watch cop cars fly off into the river in droves.\n\nI found a spot in saints row two where if you stood there, any car coming at you ramps off a small hill and straight into the water behind you \n\nTurn that cheat on that makes cars just want you dead immediately and you've got hours of fun\n\nI used to do this exact thing all the time when I wanted to laugh.\n\nDamn this is making me think of when I found ways around barriers in true crime streets of LA and where I found that residential street that was out of bounds haha I must have played the fuck outta that\n\nI wish they didn't change the AI in GTAV from when the cars on the highways would just piledrive into one another at full speed. It was hilarious watching that in San Andreas\n\nI loved lining cars up on the highway so one driver crashes, the blocking off the sides so he can't turn out. Then they just ram back and forth until the car is damaged, setting off a chain of explosions as cars get stuck in traffic.\n\nI didn’t know early saints row had the “crazy drivers” cheat too. I remember turning that on in gta III when I was far too young to be playing that game and I was freaking out bc I couldn’t figure out how to turn it off and didn’t think to just… reboot the console\n\nWhich one is \"old GTA\"? There's quite a few that would qualify as \"old\" :D\n\nGTA 5 is over 11 years old now (September 2013) so let’s say “all of them”\n\nI haven't played any since PS2 so I just said old to cover my ass. I assume you can still do this in new ones, or at least, you should be able to.\n\nI think he's talking about GTA 3, by unfinished bridge he must be talking about the Liberty City bridge that gets blown up\n\n(I will be shocked if he's talking about Liberty City Stories, no one ever talks about LCS)\n\nBeen a really long time since I played 3. But I do recall that bridge, I think. That's where the game started after the prisoner escape?\n\nThe E in Wile E. Coyote stands for Ezio\n\nDoscovered this only yesterday playing Syndicate. Was like “fuck he found me.  Nevermind. LOL”\n\nI did love how the most powerful weapon in the game was a broom. \n\n\nYou can solo a good amount of soldiers with your trusty broom.\n\nNope, sand. I used to wear all black like Batman and use nothing but the sand throw to stun and then bare hand guards throughout the night lol. You destroy em. Try it. It's a blast. \n\nThat’s it I’m setting up my PS3 and doing a Dale Gribble run. Pocket sand shshshaaaa!!\n\nYou will disassemble enemies, I'm tellin you. Ezio barehanded goes hard af. \n\nI'm super bummed going from 3 to Black Flag and finding out that everyone besides me learned to swim.\n\nEzio channeling the Blues Brothers.\n\nThat sounds hilarious.  Is there a video of this somewhere?\n\ni got nothing sorry \n\ni looked\n\njust picture the city guards yelling at you while you hug a pier by your fingers and then they jump and immediatedly die\n\nBest ones were when he reached for a ledge and you see him make the motion but just miss. Like why didn’t you grab the ledge you Italian muppet!?\n\n[you have to press a button when he is falling and he will grab it.](https://youtu.be/AOFtp1AspEM)\n\nOh man that would not only *traumatically amputate* both his arms but if it didn't, the force would probably rip the stone out of the wall of the building\n\nI love these games and I don't care for \"realism\" in them though, but I was like... DAMN that's impressive\n\nSafer to just land in the tiny haystack instead!\n\nIIRC in at least one of the games they have someone dead next to a haystack, indicating that this is some Super Special Secret Move they do.\n\nAlso it seems they have drastically reduced the heights these can be used from in newer games, or more like, I haven't found a single location in Origins or Valhalla where it's like 70 meter drop into a haystack.\n\nThat still doesn't stop me from leaping off the top of the building after synching, it has to be done.\n\nThat's in the Witcher.\n\nAhahah oh my poor old memory, but I'm sure there's at least a mention of how it isn't simple in Assassin's Creed? Doesn't the second Assassin break their arm doing the very first jump in the very first game?\n\nYeah, in the first game one breaks their leg.\n\nMe and my partner had a real good laugh at quest in Origins where you run around town with a group of kids showing them you can leap off buildings lol\n\nDammit Bayak....don't teach the kids that!!!!\n\nNot to mention decellerating that fast is the same as just hitting a stone block at that height\n\nJust hold B/Circle/Whatever on keyboard while falling and he grabs whatever is in reach. You can even pivot him to grab in a left/right direction\n\nIf anyone played this game and didn’t know this, they need to replay it. It’s a game changer to the parkour\n\nman, fuck that room. first time you also had to do that backwards hanging jump that was never explained anywhere\n\nThats sort of inherited from the old Prince of Persia series, parkour puzzles. But god i hate some of the camera works in ac2\n\nThat's why I never got into PoP.\n\nyoung me spent an insane amount of time playing PoP on our first family pc.  good times.  so many fun death animations :D\n\nNo, no, no. That's not how it happened...\n\nNew Tomb Raider games really lean into that too. You can watch Lara snuff it in like hundreds if ways lol\n\nOnly one I've played was the original 2D side scroller.  No camera issues there!  But some of them timed jumps were tricky.\n\nAnd after that, the tutorial pops up every time you need to do it. Very helpful to see it in the last 10% of the 4th game lol\n\nThis just gave me that one Altair sequence where you have to jump on a beam above a door PTSD\n\n[This fucking bastard](https://youtu.be/h6hxknNBjk8?t=20s)\n\nI fucking hated that part. Also, that particular timed parkour in one of the underground tombs was frustrating for sure!\n\ntook me till about revelations I think that I can simply do that to get higher ground\n\nCan't you run up the tower wall either side of the beam and do the tic-tac kind of jump towards it? It's been a while since I've played that one, but I think that's how I did it.\n\nDoes anyone remember the AC2 Tower where all you had to do was stand still and jump? Approaching it with parkour made it so you couldn't reach the post.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/h6hxknNBjk8?si=jCu-MeGwnUfLdluX\n\nJump backwards and hold your breath, hope for the best. I hated that. I miss it in a weird way though.\n\nWait i just enetered Venice but I though you can't do ejects from a hanging position, and that you need to be next to a wall so you can kick of it\n\nFor me it was the Altair memory and you had to climb tower. \n\nLeap of Faith ❌\n\nLeap of Death ✔️\n\nLeap of Fail\n\nEpic Leap of Fail.\n\nMemory unlocked of having to climb the exterior of a huge tower, getting *right* to the top and then jumping off into oblivion rather than to the next hold.\n\nOr [this specific bastard piece of wood](https://youtu.be/h6hxknNBjk8?t=20s). I swear I died like 5 times there\n\nI knew this was the Altair ledge/wooden post before I even opened it\n\nThe lantern just noping out was pretty funny tho\n\nHello, my name is Ezio Auditore da Firenze\n\nYou tried to kill my order \n\nPrepare to diIiiiiiiiiIIIIIIIIEEEEEEEEEEEEEeeeee\n\n[thud]\n\n“Good! A way up if I fall”\n\n*dies*\n\nRequiescat in pace.\n\n[throws hands with the pope]\n\nI don't think it means what you think it means.\n\n“Fezzik, are there rocks up ahead?”\n\nI recently started replaying the Ezio games (In the Ezio collection for PS5) and got I totally forgot how terribly clunky those games where control wise. So many points where Ezio suddenly became suicidal and decide to just hop of a tower instead of diving in the haystack…\n\nIt's because the \"sprint\" button is tied with the \"jump\" button. The moment you learn to anticipate ledges and press the free run button strategically instead of holding it down, it's a game changer.\n\nYeah in Brotherhood in the VR training thing they actually specifically teach you this if I remember correctly. (Obviously would've been better if the first 2 games explained it but at least they got to it eventually)\n\nYeah, whenever people call these games “clunky” I know they’re just holding high profile + legs without even looking where they’re going and then acting surprised when the game does what they controlled it to do. Later games just take away much of the finer control away specifically because of these kinds of complaints.\n\nLeap of faith back then required pretty specific conditions to take place. afaik usually you wouldn't be \"queued\" to take a leap of faith unless you noticed your camera starting to move into a special camera angle designed for the leap of faith.\n\n\nIf you just ran forward holding the jump button, the game would assume you want to take a normal leap, rather then using the leap of faith. Future AC game fixed this by having the leap of faith jump take priority no matter what if you got onto the ledges where you could take the plunge.\n\nAC2 kind of punishes you for being a cocky shit and assuming you are better then what the developers expected. Then the jank kicks you in the nose.\n\nACB/ACR is where these things start getting \"fixed\"\n\nThis is just factually incorrect. If a leap of faith fails it's because the angle is off.\n\nIt's one of those things where you're standing on the shoulders of giants. Better maneuverability came with newer consoles\n\nYep, gamers nowadays have it too easy. You are stuck on the leap of faith rail as soon as you touch the ledge. Back then you had to meticulously line up to trigger the jump.\n\nAt least those games gave you catch ledge to correct the mistakes of the snap targeting system. Unity is half as reliable and breakfall is completely usseless\n\nI never felt that way. Maybe the Ezio Collection is different. I suggest just playing the originals.\n\nClearly forgot to use the dagger of ti… sorry, wrong parkour universe.\n\nWoof those PoP camera angles\n\nI feel like it was the result of the freedom provided by the free running system, played Valhalla recently and it just doesn’t feel the same\n\nHonestly climbing the inside of the churches was one of my favorite parts of 2. There was a lot of janky bullshit but it was fun. I still think AC2 is where they peaked\n\nBrotherhood is peak because of the chain killing, AC2 had cooler environments though and not so much emptiness\n\nYou did go from a careful assassin that would pick his fights to an absolute murder machine, though.\n\nIt feels like brotherhood is where the fantasy started to slip.\n\nIt's been a while, but I distinctly remember being an unstoppable murder machine in AC2 as well. I never really felt like I had to pick my fights, even against many enemies I always felt pretty safe. At the very worst, you could always kill a few, then make space with the free running to get away.\n\nYou were pretty safe due to the tv tope '1 enemy attacks in a group of 10' thing that was going on. You could counter for days, but if you actually picked a fight like that, it'd take 20 minutes to churn through everyone. Brotherhood meant you could kill 20 in as many seconds.\n\nedit: i think that was the point, really. You were always supposed to be this wicked martial artist that couldn't really be bested in 1v1's, but group engagements were always supposed to feel insurmountable/difficult and escaping was the better option.\n\nFuck now I'm gonna have to replay these games again\n\nI still don’t get the Brotherhood love. It’s good but the crossbow and summoning assassins trivializes the entire game. I honestly liked Revelations more as had some interesting mechanics with the bomb making.\n\nMy head cannon at the time is that it should be difficult to do this so the mechanics were difficult. This was coping but still lol\n\nBlack flag was peak\n\nThat was a pirate simulator with AC tossed in the background. Great game, but not peak AC.\n\nI'm not sure if this is a popular opinion but God I really loved Syndicate. That's my peak AC.\n\nBlack flag was an okay AC game, but a FANTASTIC pirate game\n\nThis specific jump is the result of the devs making the decision to reposition the camera for a nice cinematic shot of the jump. Since the controls work relative to the camera, suddenly moving the camera like that has predictable results. The free running system generally worked well in places where the camera remained under your control.\n\nStarting with Unity the parkour stopped being a platformer and basically turned into autopilot and has stayed that way into the RPG style games. Lack of consistency in your jumps and a simplified moveset really hurt that game. \n\nThe older games had levels set up just for parkourinrg and they've increasingly trended towards realism in the environments. \n\nThat being said I actually think that style works better for the RPG games, I've been playing odyssey and I think the one button \"climb anything\" system works quite nicely.\n\nIf I remember correctly the auto climb started with AC 3.\n\nDamn I missed when we the parkour wasn’t fully automated just for the sake of style\n\nI've platinum'd AC2 back then but the newer AC feel not that good freerunning just due to the enviroments. Revelations gave the hookblade, actually really cool way of traversal and AC3 had the running in tree's but it also let you mix it with urban area's. The less urban an AC game is the less freerunning just feels like its a part of it.\n\nOh the hookblade?  That's the one where first you have the hook, and then you have the blade, right?\n\nw^h^a^t\n\nSkill issue\n\nFor real. All they had to do was release the free running button. Then you can easily walk slowly to the end of the beam. Then you jump. The free running system has its flaws, but this is just someone playing the game badly. This is like trying to take a sharp turn in a racing game without letting off the accelerator or using the brakes.\n\nYes, you could hold RB/R1, the character would move a little faster and wouldn't jump, but since he also hold A/X and moved the analog Ezio jumped at an angle\n\nThe old AC games had the most free parkour, in the sense that you had more control of your character and what to do, spotting blunders like these is easy when you know the system\n\nBahaha I remember this bit from when I was a kid. My GF was playing this maybe a year ago and watching her battle and rage at this exact jump was gold.\n\nSkill issue\n\nStarted replaying brotherhood on the switch! Such nostalgia\n\nHow does it hold up on Switch? I've been thinking of getting it\n\nGreat, but I had audio sync issues with AC Revelations.\n\nTo this day, when I'm playing a game and the character just jumps in a random direction to their death like this, i call it an \"Ezio moment\"\n\nWhenever i say that to people they instantly know what i mean too.\n\nI miss parkour being a challenge and not just push your stick forward.\n\nIt’s a “challenge” in that you’re wrangling the controls to get you where you want to go. Not exactly what I consider peak gameplay.\n\nIt feels so unintuitive in 3. I hope it isn't like this in the other games. Like the character gains a life of his own too.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI wanna play Titanfall 2 now.\n\n1, 2, Brotherhood, and Revelations all share the same general feel. You have a high level of control, but it's pretty janky at times. \n\n3 introduced some of the sticky/contextual feel that makes Connor feel a bit like he's doing what he wants instead of what you want.\n\nThat direction continues for a while—the character gets better at assisting you, whether you like it or not. It's cool to look at and more forgiving, but less fun. \n\nThen that system gets completely dropped for the straightforward \"climb straight up anything\" style that feels more like Breath of the Wild.\n\nThe controls are mostly fine in the older AC games, this is a skill issue.\n\nI’ve fine with a challenge so long as wonky controls and the camera don’t get in the way. Replayed AC2 and those tombs were a sonofabitch\n\nWhen was that? I played 2 and the parkour was exactly that besides some puzzle areas where I needed to figure out how to get up\n\nBefore Origins because you could only climb on clinging anchors instead of just scaling a wall because you can. Like in Origins you can just climb the side of a mountain whereas in Assassin's Creed 3 there were dedicated areas for it and usually a small puzzle\n\nI have mixed feelings about this mechanic. On one hand, I completely agree that the old way was much more fun for climbing. On the other hand, in a game of the scale of *Origins* or *Odyssey*, I don't think such a system would work. So, for the scale of those games, I think they did a good job changing the climbing mechanic.\n\nLiterally one of the best parts of AC Odyssey was climbing a mountain to assassinate one leader in a fortress, and then jumping off that cliff and landing like a superhero. \n\nAfter so many AC games with punishing fall damage or limited climb areas it felt so good to have that freedom.\n\nYou have absolutely not gone back and played 3 in a long time.\n\nI hated origins game was so pretty but the gameplay and grinding aspect sucks.\n\nI'm about to play it for the first time, can you elaborate on your specific experience?\n\nI disagree with that guy. I really really enjoyed origins. If you like to be thorough then the game is not grindy cause you’ll gain levels as you complete areas and explore them. My biggest issue was having to hunt animals to get materials for upgrading, but it wasn’t that bad and “makes sense” for the game. Have fun with it! I wish I could play it again for the first time\n\nIt’s just Grindy. The game is very pretty but I don’t want to level up a ton to even fight certain enemies in an area. Just not my kind of game. If your okay with grinding levels to be able to continue the story then you’ll love it but that was my only gripe. Gameplay just wasn’t as fun as older assassins creed games but it felt smooth\n\nThe only way any of the most recent 3 games are grindy is if you dont engage with any of the side content. As long as you mix the side missions in with the main story, you'll be just fine and properly leveled. If all you do is blitz through the main story missions, then you'll have some difficulty, but I feel like that's a normal thing to expect with RPGs. \n\nI hope you enjoy the games as Valhalla and Odyssey are in my top 3 for the series. If you do end up enjoying Origins I would suggest staying away from online communities lol. Overwhelming negativity and in-fighting.\n\nI sure didn't downvote you. Lol\n\n\nOrigins and the other two I have not played yet. I have been an AC player since the first one with the hours-long, no save point cutscene you're forced to endure the minute it loaded. \n\n\nI am a bit excited.\n\nBasically yeah it's just like any RPG. AC players just aren't used to RPGs so it feels grindy for them.\n\nOrigins was the first game from the modern Assassin's Creed RPGs, which is notable for a few reasons. First is the progression of your character, which is a combination of looted weapons, tier-based armor upgrades and XP-based level-ups (1-50 I think?) where you invest points into a skill tree to unlock new abilities in combat, stealth and archery.\n\nRegions have level ranges associated with them, and if your level or gear falls behind you may find yourself having issues. The most notable is that if an enemy is higher level than you, stealth kills aren't guaranteed - you can upgrade your hidden blade to do more damage to counteract this, but that requires you to gather some resources as you play the game.\n\nOrigins is a fantastic game, one of my favorites in the series, and a large enough one that if you enjoy exploration/side content you won't have much trouble keeping up IMO. But it's understandably very jarring to some players to see such significant progression changes from the older games, which make it possible that you would need to go do points of interest to get more XP to keep up with the enemies in the next region. In previous games, you could basically always push through with skill thanks to stealth instant kills.\n\nIt's also the first AC game to have selectable difficulty levels, and if you find it getting too grindy I highly recommend toning it down. I enjoyed the hardest difficulty, but I had a lot more time on my hands back then and I'm not sure I'd do it again on another playthrough.\n\nThank you, this is very useful. \n\nYeah this gif was all the challenge old AC parkour had. The camera/controls glitching out and causing a mistake.\n\nChallenged\\*\n\nYou have not (re)played any of the older games, have you\n\nI don't remember it being a challenge. Just extra steps to get where you wanted to go. Only thing I miss is wall ejects and side jumps to reach higher platforms. I absolutely do not miss the clunkiness of it or the inability to climb anything you want.\n\nWhen? Parkour in mainstream video games is literally never a \"challenge\" and is all just pressing a direction.\n\nMirror's Edge\n\nI mean puzzles are a challenge and I totally remember getting through some of those feeling puzzle-like.\n\nI'm seeing so many comments about the older AC games having clunky controls and like... did we play the same game? AC1 and the ezio trilogy was the best the series ever felt to play.\n\nThe people making those sorts of comments didn’t know that they sometimes needed to stop sprinting, or even just stop doing high profile actions altogether. Someone else in this post said it’s like trying to take a sharp turn in a racing game without letting off the accelerator or using the brakes and then blaming the game when you crash into the wall.\n\nGonna be honest this post is actual just a pure skill issue, the original games did have a more rougher parkour system but if you are fumbling around like this and what looks like and spamming buttons to the point where you make Ezio do some weird diamond jump pattern it's a patience/you problem.\n\nMore like a tutorial issue. Old AC games (up till syndicate basically) have mechanical depth in its movement system, but you can 'get by' just by holding down the climb/sprint button. I was one of those people until I stumbled upon Whitelight's video on the subject.\n\nThat's basically the crux of AC lasting this long and becoming a franchise that primarily targets the broadest most casual audience.\n\nWith AC3 they removed the whole \"puppet\" system and high/lo profile thing, which mean making it a lot simpler. But that also removes the direct, tactile, detail experience of movement that the Ezio/Altair games delivered. It's a compromise that has its benefits and problems but it cemented this idea that the old games are \"clunky.\"\n\nWell soon enough, people complained that AC games became too \"hand-holdy\" and easy and dumb, that you just press forward and climb everything.\n\n\\*shrug\\* you can't have it both ways\n\nIm glad I’m not the only one who suffered on this part of the parkour puzzle\n\nI can not understand what they thought while they were doing that sharp angle changes\n\nAC3 Trying to dive into haystack below the leaves somewhere, then Conner just fucking jumps to his death. They changed it so the chatacter would use a specific pose if you were going to do a leap of faith later on.\n\nI died more often from unintended jump directions than from enemies.\n\nI still get glitched ass movement in ones like Odyssey. Where I'm just like \"WHY? WHY ARE YOU NOT JUST CLIMBING UPWARDS?!\"\n\nThere were a few times where I just jumped off the towers just to kill Ezio for being so janky at times.\n\nI remember thinking just jump there, nope jump off the whole entire building then resync\n\nTypical Ezio\n\nI played Valhalla and that drove me batshit crazy. Chasing those damn flying pages and trying to run along a rooftop when all of a sudden Eivor decides to take a sharp left and drop down on top of a 6-pack of guards.\n\nI miss assassins creed games with assassins creed style gameplay\n\nI don’t remember having this problem. I remember a little jank but not that bad\n\nI think you were supposed to jump straight\n\nNever had problem with this on my six playthroughs\n\nSkill issue\n\nthat's not too different from what you have in Mirage\n\nOlder? I had this same stuff happen in Valhalla lol\n\nGood times.\n\nThose ported from console to PC controls were sometimes SO HORRID.\n\nYou don't miss being bad at them, that's fair\n\nBeggars\n\nYou got the best camera angle for the jump\n\npretty sure i died this exact same way as a kid. and then you have to start at the bottom\n\nTriggered\n\ni remember this game, it was so fun. I agree with you though this feature was pretty annoying.\n\nWild but I literally played this tomb earlier today and did the same thing. I haaaaaaate the jumping angles in this game\n\nCurrently playing through AC:BH right now. This post made me laugh. Sometimes Ezio just jumps into the void for no reason. It angers me so much\n\nResident evil ahh moment\n\nI know the frustration OP is referencing here, and I get it, but I will take the parkour system of Ezio trilogy over the \"new\" contextual systems any day. Even with the frustration and bugginess and at times general dysfunction, free movement and having the ability to jump will always rank higher for me than any drawn out flowerly movement set the character can make only in a given context\n\nOh fuck that mission! The sudden camera perspective change was infuriating!\n\nI do this on Valhalla regularly\n\nCazzo!\n\nNeed work on your camera adaptability. Been there, done that.\n\nThats exactly what I miss. The climbing was one of the best things in the old Games.\n\nThis is why shadow of Mordor/war are just so much better at being a assassins creed than assassins creed games.\n\nSame thing could happen with prince of persia sands of time its predecessor, but fortunately we could rewind back time there.\n\nStill good games though\n\nGood old days..\n\nAre you a bot?\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/z8bb2s/older_assassins_creed_games_in_a_nutshell\n\nevery rooftop guard had a PhD in eagle spotting.\n\nTo go from kind of engaging story with clunky controls, to tighter controls with nothing to hook you story wise.\n\nI agree honestly. It's a shame the narrative has taken a nose dive.\n\nWtf are you doing?\n\nYeah, there were a lot of accidental deaths during my playthroughs of 2 and brotherhood. The parkour could definitely be wonky, and aiming your jumps was truly a combination of science, art, and blind intuition.\n\nI fucking love those games. I've played through Brotherhood more times than any other game, except maybe Spider-Man during Covid lol. In my mind, Brotherhood is the peak of AC. The story was fantastic, and I was still engaged with the characters. But Rome...oh my god, what a game world. The city and the surrounding countryside had so much character and detail. For me, the setting was immaculate. Honestly, the only other open world game that can compare in terms of atmosphere and immersion is RDR2, in my opinion. Ubisoft really was fucking awesome back then.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I've played all the way up to Odyssey, although I haven't finished it. I love Origins, and I really enjoyed Syndicate as well. It's my belief that Ubisoft will never make another game that makes me feel like Brotherhood did. Classic AC was basically my entire teenage years. It's a treasured memory of safety and escape from an otherwise rough time.\n\nBack then AC2 and ~~Far Cry 3~~ Skyrim with guns were my go to games, replayed both like 4-5 times as a kid! Such amazing gems.\n\nAC 2 was the first game of this kind I played, and I too still love it. 2 probably more than Brotherhood, but the whole Ezio trilogy and kinda also every game up to Syndicate. Played them several times each and I'll be replaying 2 and Brotherhood next year because I'll be visiting Venice, Rome and Florence in May. I'm really excited to see some of the places in reality.\n\nAlso I can only agree on RDR2, that game is so beautiful and well written, it's a masterpiece. If you haven't played it yet, I'd like to recommend Horizon Zero Dawn / Forbidden West, these two are the only ones that I love as much as the old AC games and RDR.\n\nZero Dawn is amazing! I love it so much. I haven't played Forbidden West yet, because I don't know how it will run on my PS4.\n\nI have a basic PS4 and Forbidden West ran fine on it. I'm not too bothered by performance mode or such stuff, and the loading times were a bit long, but other than that it worked fine. Oh, and the DLC will only run on PS5, of course, but as you can upgrade from 4 to 5 (at least you could, I assume you still can), I'd say go for it,\n\ni tried playing ac2 but it was janky ASF. went back to playing black flag and i did not regret it\n\nThat’s why its called the leap of faith, cause you don’t know if you will leap 8ft to a ledge or 80ft to your death\n\nI have 100% AC2 and probably have 1k hours on it… i dont remember this ever happened to me.. there were times of the camera being weird and awkward but never messing with the input. Skill issue if you ask me\n\nSkill issue\n\nNice\n\nHaha good times"

    "all_comment_text": "I had no idea one voice actor played both roles, which is a testament to her talent. RIP.\n\nShe was also several Pokemon, including Jigglypuff. She's actually the VA for Jigglypuff in Smash Bro games.\n\nSo she was the real jiggly puff from above this whole time.\n\nShe is now ♥️\n\nbruh\n\nDamn, now I'm gonna have to let a Jigglypuff main win Everytime now\n\nSo all those scenes of Misty cuddling up to Jigglypuff, she was cuddling herself!?\n\nAnd she must have been only 19 at the time! That's crazy good talent\n\nher age was widely misreported, she was \\~28 when she started pokemon. doesn't take away anything, of course, i've just seen 46 in so many articles, but she was 55\n\njames/brock had the same va too.\n\nHe was also kaiba\n\n[removed]\n\nThe first region of Pokemon anime had such a bizarre bite to it, thanks to funny one liners and great voice actors like her\n\nAnd that one time Ash had a gun pulled on him. \n\nPeople always talk about the banned Dratini episode, but in the Squirtle Squad episode, he entered a shop and had like 4 guns pulled on him immediately.\n\nWhat about the giant Tentacruel episode, where the old lady is shooting two AK47s?\n\nthe one that was banned because of 9/11?\n\nWhich is funny, because Tentacruel destroying a skyscraper was in the intro song to every episode.\n\nI'm pretty sure I had that one on VHS lol.\n\nBanned Dratini episode? You gotta clue me in here.\n\nhttps://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/EP035#Banning\n\nThat’s pretty tame.\n\nIt might have been right after Columbine. Having a gun pointed at a ten year old wasn't a good look after that.\n\nThat’s fair. I guess I was just expecting something way out in left field.\n\nDon't forget James in a bikini punching himself in the inflatable tits.\n\nIt’s wild how coded James was, and I never once noticed. I just thought he was funny and slightly dumb. I’m not sure if he was meant to be gay, or trans or something else.. but one thing is for sure.. he was not a smart cookie.\n\nWatching his compilation scenes from the early seasons is hilarious, especially when he got sassy at Jessie. To me, the original dub will always be the superior dub. RIP Rachel.\n\nPulling a gun on a 10 year old? Wow, I can't believe that Japan would appropriate American culture like that.\n\nFunny enough, it got that episode banned in the US. That's why there's a jump when they go to the Safari zone, then the next episode Ash suddenly has a shit load of Kangaskhan. Or however you spell it. Because the episode where it happened was banned.\n\nEdit: spelling\n\nTauros, you mean, right? The one you’re thinking of is spelled Kangaskhan though. Both are found in the safari zone and are fairly rare 😁\n\nMaybe it was Taurus. I forget exactly. It's been forever since I watched it.\n\nEdit: double checked on the wiki. It was 30 Taurus.\n\nIt was Taurus.  I remember an episode where Professor Oak was comparing Ash and Gary's pokedex entries.  Ash had caught more Pokemon, but only because most of them were the Taurus he caught.  Gary had more unique Pokemon species at the time.\n\nAsh's approach to capturing pokemon was extremely weak. Strong contender for worst trainer on the continent.\n\nTo be fair, asking a kid to catch and care for 151 wild pets is kind of a big load to carry.\n\nAt least Pokemon Ranger makes a bit more sense, since they only ask for assistance, then release the creature back into the wild.\n\nHes just a kid!\n\nIt was such a striking addition, too. Normally you have the main characters catching pokemon and caring about them equally, but all of a sudden you now have Oak dealing with a whole ass herd of Tauros in the background for a couple episodes purely as a brick joke. Then you just stop hearing about them, soooo.... yeah.\n\nDon’t worry, they were delicious.\n\nThey did show up in the final episodes cheering for Ash's world champ stuff at least. Although not all of them, just a few for some reason...\n\nReminds me of what happened when Outlaw Star first ran in the US. There is an episode near the end of the series that takes place on a planet filled with hot springs with a ton of fan service so it got cut/banned and never aired...*but* the episode was also super vital to the plot because it's where and why the main character gets some incredibly powerful bullets for his gun. So people watching the show just arrive at the episode afterwards where he's like yeah I got these bullets and etc and you're watching like wait what? where did he get those?? who is he talking about??? wtf??? but the show just moves on because it assumes you saw the prior episode. ¯\\\\\\_(ツ)_/¯\n\nTo be fair no way was that going to make the cut on cable TV, there was way way way too much nudity for it to ever make it past the censors. It's in the OVA collection and it is well, very Gene, to put it mildly.\n\nahh outlaw star censorship was a trip. My favorite was the pilot being hurt and passed out and the kid coming up and putting a hand on him and finding a ton of blood on his hand.  They cut all the injury stuff out but still had the kid put his hand on him, then stare at his emty hand and declare \"Oh no! what's this?\" IT'S YOUR HARD, NUMBNUTS!\"\n\nReminds me of the Yu-Gi-Oh episode where they edited out the guns so the guys are just pointing their fingers before Kaiba skillfully Gambits them with a playing card.\n\nThe Squirtle Squad ep wasn't banned and it had a whole saloon of people point guns at Ash\n\nOh, that happened more than once.\n\nAsh and Misty dissing each other like adults in season 1-2 was crazy\n\nBeen rewatching this recently with my kids and some of those one liners are legit laugh out loud funny, totally goes over their heads though\n\nyep and thats the whole point. So its enjoyable for us all lol. Ash being a little misogynistic prick in a kids show is so funny because as a kid i didnt pick up on it\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWEYIx2pZY\n\n\"This camera is my life.\"\n\n\"Get yourself a new life!\"\n\nHis diss on Todd was hilarious how have I not recalled that one\n\n\"Misty, please, only one of us can hallucinate at a time.\" Holy shit that was great.\n\nThe music is cut so hilariously a few times. A song will just like keep playing for an extra 30 seconds\n\nGen 2 is identical. I'm watching through it right now, and season 5, and it has me laughing just as much. It doesn't really start changing til gen 3.\n\nIt seems like this voiceover was a part of everyone’s childhood\n\nDamn had no idea she voiced both characters, and both were so different too. An iconic voice from my childhood for sure.\n\nRest in peace.\n\nShe voiced Jigglypuff too.\n\nand pikachu when they needed fresh lines because the japanese were too dirty for him\n\nWhat is this about dirty pikachu?\n\nPikachu was a foul mouthed asshole in the first few episodes.\n\n&gt; Voiced by Danny Devito\n\nCan I offer you a pokeball in this trying time?\n\n\"I'm gonna tray-ashh that gym leader!\"\n\nMagnum dong joke incoming\n\nOops I dropped my pocket monster condom for my Magnemite dong.\n\nI will never get the sight of dvitochu out of my head now thanks to you\n\nPikachu has a different voice a couple of times because they usually kept the original Japanese voice actress' lines in the English dub, but sometimes they were mixed up with another character's lines that needed to be redone.\n\nI hope this doesn't awaken something in me.\n\nNot the same line but she voiced princess Charolette from berserk also. Pretty big deal for both communities. RIP Queen. Fuck cancer.\n\nI knew and enjoyed every bit of that game. May she rest in peace.\n\nBrock and Misty were also James and Jessie respectively \n\nMost animated shows only have a small cast of VAs and they reuse them as much as possible for budget reasons. In SpongeBob, Plankton and Larry and “My Leg!” Fish and many other side characters are all voiced by the same guy.\n\nSee also: Futurama.\n\nBilly West voices like 20% of the main cast and like 90% of the supporting characters.\n\nThe most invisible legend of our time.\n\nGoing father back, mel blanc was pretty much all the Looney toons\n\n90% of The Simpsons is just Dan Castellaneta and Harry Shearer.\n\nDon't forget Hank Azaria\n\n&gt; and they reuse them as much as possible for budget reasons\n\nI mean, this also works heavily in the VA's favor. Shows they have tremendous range, multiple characters to put on their resume, and gives them more leverage in future negotiations (don't want to pay a fair wage? Good luck replacing not one but _multiple_ characters in the show)\n\nIt's even more pronounced in Anime, where only a few dozen VAs do most of the English dubs.\n\nbrock and james had the same VA too\n\nFor anyone wondering the cause of death, she unfortunately lost her hard fought battle to breast cancer \n#fcancer\n\nFuck Cancer, indeed. I do prefer Norm Macdonald’s opinion on it: \n“I’m not a doctor, but I’m pretty sure if you die, the cancer dies at the same time. That’s not a loss. That’s a draw.”\nRegardless, very unfortunate news.\n\nThis comment means a lot to me. Never heard it explained like that, but means my Dad didn’t lose in the end. Thank you sincerely\n\nYeah.   Lost both my folks within 2 years.   Stage 1 esophagus cancer, stage 4 lung and stage 2 breast(survived), stage 4 brain (inoperable).   I'm grateful everyday they didn't linger and it was quick.   Fuck cancer.\n\nI just lost my Dad to esophageal cancer two weeks ago, he only found out 7 weeks before he died at 60. F*ck cancer.\n\nHugs to you.  It's a shitty thingy to go through.\n\nYour dad fought a long and hard battle with everything he had. Cancer is a battle of attrition, and unfortunately he had to pull the final card in his hand to bring it to a draw.\n\nMy mother is fighting cancer right now, it's something I think about a lot.\n\nThank you for your kind words and hope your mother and yourself are doing as well as can be. It stays on your mind for years afterwards and never truly goes away but he fought it with dignity and the same spirit he had through life. \n\nAlways here if you ever want to vent or talk.\n\nMan what a beautiful quote, gonna keep that one.\n\nNorm was a tough dude.  He fought cancer for a *long* time, for years and years and never said anything about it.\n\nI didn’t even know he was sick\n\nFrom what I've seen, very few people did\n\nSame with Chadwick Boseman, not many people knew he had colon cancer (iirc on not many people knowing), died around the same age (think 3 years younger) as Rachael Lillis.\n\nFuck cancer.\n\nTrue. But also, search \"norm\" and that quote\n\nNorm was a cool dude, he made a career out of being one of the smartest guys in the room pretending to be one of the dumbest.\n\nThe more I hear about this Norm fella, the more I like him!\n\nWatch his appearance on Late Night with Conan when Courtney Thorne Smith is the guest. He kills.\n\n\nhttps://youtu.be/bKmadR4Ye54?si=Xp8vMsHI7ZoE7M6r\n\nAh, that ol' chunk of coal\n\nI always enjoyed a quote I remember but don't remember where it originated from. But it sounds very similar to yours. Was something like...\n\n\"I fight to live longer than it wants me to out of spite for it. And when I do die? I'm taking it with me out of spite too.\"\n\nNorm was such a legend. He had his own draw with cancer and told literally no one he was sick. Still miss his wry smile.\n\nOr so the germans would have us believe.\n\nUnfortunately in the case of Henrietta Lacks it wasn't a draw.\n\nHoly shit, She was just diagnosed with it at the beginning with may as far as I know too..\n\nreminder to everyone to get checked regularly\n\nI dont have the money to do that lmao i love this wonderful life\n\nIf you are in the US, I believe your insurance is required to offer you free mammograms every 1-2 years once you are 40yrs old or older (that's when you really need to start checking)\n\nAFAIK, it's once yearly free mammogram. My gyno also said that for a person with no family history and no preconditions or risk factors (beyond age), you can get away with doing it at most every 3 years.\n\nWhile mammograms are more precise, you can also do a self-exam. This guide is fairly well explained:  \n\n\nhttps://www.breastcancer.org/screening-testing/breast-self-exam-bse\n\n\nIf you notice anything out of the usual you should visit even a family doctor and I'm sure they can help you find a way to get proper screening. \n\nMy mom died about 25 years ago to breast cancer.\n\nBack then I was certain that people would figure out a way to heal cancer soon. That she was just unlucky to be born too soon. Now look at us. More than 25 years later and people still die because of cancer. Fuck cancer!\n\nI was with my fiance while she battled cancer. Never felt more helpless while trying to be hopeful. The strength of anyone fighting through that is beyone admirable. F cancer.\n\nEdit- thanks to everyone for the kind words in my inbox.  I feel the need to clarify.  My fiance is fine. She won her battle and has been in remission for almost 2 years now.\n\nF cancer indeed.  My wife was diagnosed 2 years ago at 35.  She’s luckily cancer free after chemo, radiation, and a double mastectomy but that is definitely not the end of the battle.  She is now in medically induced menopause (in her 30s) for 10 years and has anxiety with every ache and pain she has.  As an example, she’s going to her oncologist this week for what is more than likely a swollen lymph node just to be sure.\n\nSo say it with me F cancer.\n\nFUCK CANCER\n\nI refuse to shorten fuck to F because I'll not pay my respects to cancer\n\nShe tied.\n\nOh NOOOOO. I’m so sorry for her and her family.\n\nMan I know it's probably just the Baader–Meinhof phenomenon but lately it just seems like everyone is dying of cancer. Just lost my MIL to cancer 3 days ago and then this headline and then it seems like the last 10 people I've looked up or 'X person has died' headlines have died to cancer.\n\nLike 10 Facebook posts on my wall were related to cancer too, plus my Youtube feed (I watched like one video and now it's filled to the brim with people dying of cancer and saying their farewells or just posting updates of their treatments...it's a nightmare).\n\nIt's draining and I'm sick of thinking about it.\n\nFucking awful. Her voice work was legendary and irreplaceable. Rest in peace.\n\nDamn, Misty was my first crush\n\nDamn, Jessie was my first crush 😭\n\nAnd for one episode, James\n\nWe all know the one.\n\nThe one we discover he is rich\n\nFlaming Moltres\n\nOnly one?\n\nIn the first (maybe second?) season of the show, James disguises himself as a woman and well.... He was kinda stacked, ngl.\n\nHe did that a lot. Most of his disguises were womens' clothes, for some reason.\n\n\"for some reason\"\n\n[Team Rocket, destroying gender roles since 1997.](https://preview.redd.it/5snqnbvv1ky41.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ee80750161138e1a9b85bd31a05f5deb0e2ee136)\n\nSame. I .. might have a type. \n\nThis is extremely sad news.\n\nDefinitely Jessie for me as well. At least one of my first crushes.\n\nHaha same first anime waifu\n\nI was like 6 or 7 when Pokémon came to America.\n\nVeronica Taylor, the original English voice of Ash Ketchum, shared the sad news:\n\n&gt;\"We all know Rachael Lillis from the many wonderful roles she played. She filled our Saturday mornings and before/after school hours with her beautiful voice, her terrific comic timing, and her remarkable acting skills.\"\n\n&gt;\"It is with a very heavy heart that I share the news of the passing of Rachael Lillis on Saturday evening, 10 August, 2024.\n\n&gt;\"Rachael was an extraordinary talent, a bright light that shone through her voice whether speaking or singing. She will be forever remembered for the many animated roles she played, with her iconic performances as Pokemon's Misty and Jessie being the most beloved. Rachael was so thankful for all the generous love and support that was given to her as she battled cancer. It truly made a positive difference. Her family also wishes to thank you as they take this time to grieve privately. A memorial is being planned for a future date.\n\nWow she died young\n\nFr kids just started watching Pokémon, to know she was only like 21 or so is crazy to my kid brain\n\nShe’s only a couple years older than me and I still feel like a kid.  Fuck man. \n\nYeah, I was surprised at that age given how long ago the show was. She must have been really young when she started.\n\nI'm seeing NY Times and wiki say she was 55. And conflicting birthdays from wiki cached image vs page. Other sources say 46.\n\nCorrection NYTimes says she was 55:\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/12/arts/television/rachael-lillis-dead.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;referringSource=articleShare&amp;sgrp=c-cb\n\nI thought she must have did the voices in the newer adaptations of Pokémon because she was so young. Nope, she started when she was only 20. What a gig to get at that age.\n\nAnd Revolutionary Girl Utena 😔\n\nCan you really say your girlfriend loves you, if she doesn't literally turn into a car to illustrate you seizing control of your own destiny?  🙃\n\nFair winds, Rachael.  The power to revolutionize the world, lives on in your work.\n\nMy anime goat\n\nGod damn. She was part of the childhood of MANY millennials.\n\nRest in peace Rachael. You are a legend.\n\nImportant note, this was the OG voice for Misty and Jessie, as in she voiced Jessie and Misty up until after Pokemon: Lucario and the Mystery of Mew released, in which they switched to another voice actor.\n\nIconic woman. She will be missed.\n\nPart of the 4KIDS group\n\nRIP. Iconic voice for my childhood\n\nThis is so sad. Way too young to die\n\n[removed]\n\nSad cause Meowth’s voice actor died in 2008 🥺\n\nJames is all that we have left.\n\nJames voice actor retired last year too\n\nI’m glad he’s alive.\n\n): fuck cancer\n\nRest in peace.\n\nGenuinely sucks to hear cancer take another victim.\n\nMy childhood favorites just slowly fizzling out... guess it gets worse as you hit your 40's...\n\nVery sad.\n\nShe passed at 46. The first English episode of Pokémon was in 1998. Doing the math, she started doing the voices for Misty and Jessie when she was 20.\n\nThat stood out to me as well... I was a big pokemon fan at the time and had no idea Jessie's VA was only a few years older than me.\n\nRest in peace :(\n\nJust to note she was alsoo the voice of jigglypuff, including being the one who son the jigglypuff song.\n\nWhat??? I'm shocked and terribly saddened... Really makes you think how long we have on this earth... Another 60 years? 20? 5 years?\n\nGod damnit...\n\n[removed]\n\nOne of the best moments in the marvel movies is when the Sorcereress supreme is dying and talking to Strange about waiting and stealing  another few seconds just to watch the snow. \n\n“We don’t get to choose our time. Death is what gives life meaning. To know your days are numbered and your time is short. You’d think after all this time I’d be ready. But look at me. Stretching one moment out into a thousand... just so that I can watch the snow.”\n\n[removed]\n\nI love the strange movies. Even multiverse I liked a good bit.\n\nWe humans are the stars that shine the brightest, but just for a few moments, but oh man, how bright we shine, thank you Rachel Lillis\n\nNo... Jesse was my first crush...\n\nF cancer\n\nMe and all my Caterpies hate cancer.\n\nCome now. Say it with your chest! \n\n*FUCK cancer!* \n\nAlmost took my Wife's bio mom. I dread to think it happening to my girl.\n\nFuck cancer\n\nRest in peace\n\nThe Latin American voice actress also passed away in 2021.\n\nFuck cancer. That is just wrong. 46 is far to young.\n\nDamn looks like team rocket blasted off for the final time.\n\nBro. 🥲\n\nR.I.P Another legend gone…\n\nShe was *just* diagnosed in May. Perhaps it's insensitive, I just... I'm baffled. I have to wonder how terrible it was, did she not get checked, what happened to the point it had gotten so aggressive so quickly, or was it undetected? Either way, biggest FUCK you, cancer. Just awful...\n\nI believe that part of the article is a bit off, because that’s around the time the go fund me started and they were raising the money to help get her better care in a nursing home, and not in a hospital where she was too uncomfortable to rest.\n\nShe had breast cancer that spread into the spine. When I read that part for the first time, I googled what happens when cancer spreads into the spine and saw it was BAD. That’s when I knew if I donated it was to help her last few months be less painful. And so I did…\n\nAnd her sister kept us updated through the go fund me. Just a few days ago the sister said she was in a lot of pain again and that they hoped to get her comfortable soon. And then the next day… That was that.\n\nIf you want to see the updates on go fund me, written by the sister, it should all be there.\n\nSome of it can be pretty sad though. Some of it is rather touching.\n\nThe whole thing is such a shock…\n\nConsidering her age bracket doctors may have fobbed her off initially. At lot of doctors are very lazy about cancer testing if you’re not in the age bracket for high risk.\n\nThat's so crazy... in recent years we have had an *unbelievable* jump in breast cancer diagnosis numbers in women who are UNDER 40, let alone who are over that. This country really makes me want to flip tables sometimes.\n\nWay too young. RIP\n\nAww man, that's so sad. Misty was many a kids first crush back in the day.\n\nThat’s too young.\n\nI remember most of the Pokémon voice team also doing the Slayers anime RIP\n\nWow. Terrible news. She was talented as hell\n\nThat's terrible. She was far too young\n\n\nRest in peace \n\nOnly 46? Dang \n\nSo fucking sad.  I wrote her a fan letter in middle school after I found out she voiced literally all of my favorite characters, and told her how I wanted to get into voice acting someday.  Not only did she send an autograph but she WROTE BACK- like, pen on paper, with tips on how to practice and stuff.  Such an incredibly sweet and talented person 🖤\n\nsad to lose a legend like her, crazy that she voiced two of the most iconic characters in the og show\n\n*\"I was prepared for trouble- but not like this...\"*\n\nWe truly lost a voice acting baddie and icon today💔\n\nI feel like a piece of my childhood just died.\n\n\nI didn't know anything about her, but she is connected to some good memories of watching this before going to school.\n\n\nRIP \n\nShe was really great as Jessie. I will miss her voice acting.\n\nWay too soon for her to pass away. It's not fair.\n\n“Today, the anime fandom is mourning following the loss of Rachael Lillis. The voice actress made their mark on dubbing with roles dating back to 1997, but their work on Pokemon as Misty and Jessie has transcended generations. Sadly, the actress passed away on August 10 amid her battle with breast cancer. Lillis was 46 years old.” - From the article\n\nYeah just fuck cancer.\n\n46 is so young.\n\nShe was 55.\n\nI pray for the repose of her soul.This is the first time I've heard that Misty (Kasumi) and Jessie (Musashi) are played by the same VA in the English version.\n\nIs no one gonna report on the fact that every new source got her age wrong? Lol\n\nher voice was ?? incredible !!???? she fucking voiced two almost major characters and i could NOT tell it was the same perspn??? also this is making me feel incredibly old lmao\n\nOh no that's so sad I grew up watching Pokémon 😢\n\nBeing a 30 yr old parent who watched Pokémon growing up as a kid, 46 is not that far off from me. May her rest peacefully; and her family, and the Pokémon team all grieve and and cherish the thought about her. She’s affected so many childhoods\n\nDamn, man 😢\n\nRIP\n\nman this sucks."

    "all_comment_text": "I had really good memories with the magazine as a kid back in the day. RIP\n\nPassing around Game Informer magazines in high school just to get a glimpse of Vice City screenshots is a core memory for me.\n\nI remember reading release of the GameCube and Xbox with such obsession! Staring at pictures of halo and rogue squadron and speculating about smash brothers and Mario 128 and the Zelda space world demo with my friends in middle school. Definitely a core memory\n\nOmg, Mario 128.\n\nYou sent me in quite the memory spiral\n\nI used to usher movie theaters as my first job back in the day and I very strongly remember walking the halls waiting for ratatouille and transformers to get done with my coworker buddies just reading the modern warfare article just mind blown they were going modern and how good it looked. What a time to be alive then\n\n&gt; ratatouille\n\nsame time as CoD4? No way......WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK!!!\n\nFuck, modern warfare was so dope back then. I remember seeing all the info about it. The sniper mission is still imprinted in my brain. Also besides Blackhawk down and unreal tournament, was really the first game I played online a shit ton.\n\nJesus Christ this makes me feel old lol.....\n\nI re-read the Skyrim article like a thousand times because my parents weren't keen on me playing an M-rated game. A friend eventually let me borrow a copy and my dad was like \"oh yeah that looks fine.\"\n\nSo many GI magazines. Kinda wish I'd kept a subscription to collect them all.\n\nThe Skyrim one was really good. I had that one when I was in college lol\n\nOr the time I printed out some porn and stuck it in the San Andreas gameinformer, forgot about it and brought that issue to school. I was so popular that day.\n\n&gt; printed out some porn\n\nOh, this is a brand new sentence for some of the younger folks here\n\nJust thinking about how long it would take for the picture to load on a 56k modem and then print on a slow ass printer makes me laugh, that's some dedication right there haha.\n\nThe amount of ink used just to stare at some boobs.... Idk if I would be mad at my kid for the porn, but for wasting so much money on printer ink.\n\nInk?? Back in the day we dot-matrixed those titties, and we were thankful to do it!\n\nHey, boobs had a lot more value before 2005ish. \n\nThe same guys would watch scrambled Playboy channel for hours in hopes that it would clear up enough to see some boobs or bush. Or steal nudie magazines from their Dad or find a copy in the woods.\n\nBeing able to find an infinitely reproducible clear copy of digital porn after only 30 minutes of download time was insane. (Memories from the 9600 baud era)\n\n(Dial tone) \n\n\n(9596 4275)\n\nBeep? Beep! Brrrrrrrrr.\nDING DING DING DING brrrf\n\n\n(56k) Gdadah gdaah ghdadah rrrrrr DVDRGZHJNKXLMPCXXCCxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx(BEEP?)xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxcx\n\ni could never imagine printing out porn. the printer would never look at me the same way again\n\ni just pictured someone making lewd woodcuts to be used in a printing press and sheepishly handing them over to the operator. that *has* to be a thing that happened\n\nIt was certainly a thing with Japanese wood block printing. So called \"Spring\" prints (shunga) were popular at times and they had to get them to buyers somehow.\n\n“Why is my printer port blocked???”\n\nWhat are you doing step-printer?\n\nI used to go to the grocery store, they had video game mags on the bottom, fashion mags scattered around, and porn in plastic wrappers on top.   We (maybe 10-13 at the time) would sneak a hustler mag, and place it inside the video game mag, and stand in the corner giggling pretending we were reading Game Informer.  Once we got caught by some adult dude and he just laughed and walked away. We swore he was going to tell our moms\n\nI still remember using the GTAIV exclusive issue as evidence that Niko was supposed to have fingerless gloves in the game.\n\nIt’s right there on the cover and in screenshots!\n\nPeak bathroom reading before the smartphone.\n\nPeak bathroom reading after smartphone for me too.\n\nI used to keep the latest issue on a shelf next to my toilet... the last one I got is still there, the cover story was a preview of Cyberpunk.\n\nReading the Halo 3 issue about multiplayer when I was away at camp the summer before it came out is a thing I will always remember.\n\nEven online they seemed to be on the cusp of games media. Replay/Super Replay with Dan, Tim, Reiner and a rotating cast of awesome GI employees like Ben Reeves and Jeff Cork was my life for a very short but awesome few years.\n\nGI hasn't really been on my radar lately but it's sad a place like that, that fosters not only its customer's but its staff's love for videos games, has to close up shop.\n\nEnd of an era, Kyle Hilliard still owes me a beer.\n\nSuper Replay was incredible at a time when there weren't let's plays of every game imaginable on YouTube. The dynamics between Dan Rykert, Tim Turi, Andrew Reiner, etc was so much fun and it felt like being in a room with a bunch of your best buds playing your favorite games shooting the shit. Especially once they started doing replays for bad games like Overblood lol\n\nIt's been years since I've tuned into anything from GI but at their peak it was some great comfort food. Incredibly sad to see it go like this.\n\nI miss Jeff cork.\n\nWhen I lived in Minneapolis in 2010, my friend was also a good friend of Ben Reeves, and he pulled a favor and got me a tour of their offices.  Everyone there was so incredibly nice and enthusiastic, they all, including Andy Macnamara, took time out to talk to me about what I needed to do to become a writer, and about games, and everything.  They let me play some of their advanced copies of games they were reviewing and asked my opinion on them, and showed me their vault where they had every game that had ever come out since they started, and it blew my mind.  Its one of my favorite memories and I stayed a subscriber all these years.  They made me feel so welcome and accepted.  I truly hope they all get to keep pursuing what they love with minimal unemployment time, cause the industry needs folks who truly love it like they do.\n\nMannnn remember “next generation” magazine? I think it had the fancier covers?? Around n64 times? And had game demos?? Fuck pre internet stuff was lit\n\nNext Generation was awesome, I think it was British (?) but you could get it in the states and the thick cover page and glossy pictures just made it the connoisseurs gaming mag. *sniffles* good times man\n\naw, this makes me sad too RIP\n\nI used this magazine to help me understand video games so I could connect better with my kid and stepkids who all were huge gamers. (old person here)\n\nI'd have kept my subscription if they didn't insist on constantly changing mine to a digital subscription even though I repeatedly told them I wanted the print version.\n\nI used to read it while following my mom around in the grocery store. I still remember how excited I was the year she bought me a subscription for my birthday.\n\nReading all the ratings in the back to find new games to play. The opportunities were endless and there was always something great getting hyped\n\nHaven’t read it in the last decade or so but I remember as a kid I really liked Reiner for some reason.\n\nMy exact thoughts. I always loved when rockstar would reveal their newest game with a 10 page spread. \n\nHonestly, lasting until 2024 was probably the best run Game Informer could have asked for. It's a shame and it sucks for everyone that just got laid off, but magazines have just been on the decline for two decades at this point.\n\nI'm surpised they didn't go completely digital, tbh.\n\n I know nobody who does, or would pay for a digital video game magazine unfortunately, and I'd include myself. There is just no value added compared to the overwhelming number of free options.\n\nThere was a time, maybe 10 years ago, where Game Informer was actually the most-subscribed digital magazine and was one of the most widely circulated print magazines in the US. It was mainly due to them bundling subscriptions with GameStop rewards memberships.\n\nI feel like the unintentional death knell for their magazine was when GameStop took away the ability to use their five dollar reward on digital items like Robux and whatever. I was getting the magazine subscription and just putting them in a pile but I’d have stayed subbed if I could still use it\n\nI think their death knell was GameStop failing in general. Ironically, I think from a general point of view, the short sellers of GME kinda had a point: online shopping dominates retail, and GameStop doesn’t offer anything special that you can’t buy online (The problem with short sellers is that they did it in a real fucked up way, and it exposed a ton of general inequalities in the financial system).\n\nEven though GameStop is kind of being kept alive because of the stock fiasco, the actual shopping seems to be down within brick-and-mortar locations. That’s what drove the subscriptions.\n\nEdit: For the people trying to argue with me about the financial inequalities: [Here’s a detailed report by the Cato Institute.](https://www.cato.org/cato-journal/fall-2021/gamestop-episode-what-happened-what-does-it-mean#procyclicality-margin-rules-and-option-trading)\n\n[Here’s a more digestible explanation by Jon Stewart.](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=bP74RBTE8kI)\n\nI’m not an Ape nor GME investor. I don’t think the stock has particular value by any normal trading standards. I think it’s value was in being an act of financial rebellion executed by the proletariat before it was crushed by the powers that be. Ya fucking wallstreet bootlickers.\n\nGamestop in particular having an infamously pushy and obnoxious customer service experience certainly didn't help either.\n\nThat also corrolates to their reputation for poor employement practices too (sales based scheduling.. If you don't get good sales, hours get cut, can't make more sales with less hours, don't get more hours, work two 4 hour shifts a week until you're fired)\n\nAs a former SGA/Acting SL, yeah the sales pushes from District Leadership and higher really put a hamper on what was otherwise a solid gig. \n\nI stuck around a few months after getting robbed at gunpoint, steel to head; but I left after the increasing pressures of needing ever increasing sales figures, with warranties, memberships with less incentives for customers to get it, and so much more. \n\nWhen I was in charge of scheduling for the short time that I was, I didn't have enough people to even consider cutting hours for sales issues. I was made aware of the sales stuff, but they'd never had enough employees at my location/associated locations nearby to really do that. \n\nIt didn't help that our store was an LP store, prone to robberies, revolving door of employees, and just low traffic in general. On our busiest days, we'd have 30 paying customers out of 45 browsing. Most of them either traded stuff in for cash and didn't want anything to do with Power Up Rewards, or already had it as they were regulars to our less hectic store. \n\nThe redistricting at the end of 2022 to shift how many stores were in each District really fucked a lot of things up. I just wish the company would go under finally.\n\nI went to one the other day looking for used PS5 games. They were selling used CoD Cold War for $50... I then bought it on ebay for $21. The person working there was really pushy too, and when I asked if the PS4 version was cheaper and if they had it in stock he was evasive. \n\nIf I can't even get a deal on used games, what's the point of that store?\n\nTheir used prices have ALWAYS been ass.\n\nLast time I was in one they had a copy of TLOZ TOTK for Switch for $63 before tax, minus the original case the game came in, that was last year and haven't been in one since.\n\nHell even right now they'll give you $9 cash for a single joy con and turn around and sell it for $32.99. Why would you buy 2 used Joy-Cons for $65 when the brand new ones are $5 more?\n\nUnless you're desperate for a power cable and need it day of or just a kid who doesn't have a bank account and has birthday money to burn the store sucks. \n\nTake me back to midnight releases where you got hordes of promo shit just for showing up.\n\nIn my brief stint working for GameStop I loved buying games I wanted off people for more than GameStop would give them for it but less than what GameStop would sell it for. Felt like a win-win\n\nI went to a GameStop about six months ago looking for Baldurs Gate 3, not knowing it didn't have a physical release at the time. The clerk had no idea what game I was talking about, despite it recently winning game of the year\n\nI have to agree, I believed in a GME turnaround when the stock had its first meme gold rush... but no more. GameStop was given the ultimate lifeline and they utterly squandered it. Nothing has meaningfully changed in those stores now vs several years ago when they were on the brink of going under. They needed to course correct and reduce the plastic Spencer's gifts knickknack funko-pop garbage, they should have gotten into the retro game sales and refurbishment 5-10 years ago - rode that wave, and made that part of their identity, they should have leveraged assets like GI to some useful ends rather than sitting around, thumbs up asses, waiting for revenue to decline to the point where layoffs are a necessity.\n\nTLDR: GameStop is run by smooth-brained incompetents\n\nI got a free subscription through Funcoland when I bought my PS2, So I imagine they got a lot of subs that way. \n\nI have no idea how much time I spent rereading the articles and rereading the articles and looking staring at the pictures of GTA 3.\n\nits more about just wanting a physical thing and appreciating the layout and design, splash pages, cover, etc.\nplus, if you grew up with magazines, they’re nice, the reader letters in the beginning, the reviews at the end. gotta love it\n\n[deleted]\n\nand they will be lost to the sands of time\n\nI'm seeing a small resurgence in fan zines again. And for much the same reason - having a nicely made physical object in your hands is always better.\n\n\nWho knows: maybe magazines will make comeback as a luxury collectable, like vinyl.\n\nThey are practically works of art verses websites now that are a travesty to the eyes with pop ups and ads galore.\n\nYup, when I renewed after years for GameStop, they only offered me digital GI. I collected them for the covers, it lost me interest. Flipping around them was the only reason to use a magazine instead of an article website. Digital magazine is just the least convenient method of relaying information for me. I love GI, and this sucks. But I’m not surprised at all.\n\nThey were owned by Gamestop for a long time. Gamestop used them as an excuse to peddle the Power Up Rewards for a while.\n\n\nI'll miss GI, but they hadn't really been relevant for the better part of a decade.\n\nI was about to argue that that can't be true because they had a really good podcast that I used to listen to all the time...back in **2019**.\n\nMost of the folks that made the podcast good back then branched off to MinnMax after one of the rounds of layoffs at GI in 2019.\n\nThat was only Ben Hanson, not most of the people. He did take a couple of other former people as contributors, but they weren’t GI podcast regulars. Jeff M, Suriel Vasquez, and Kyle Hilliard, specifically. Lots of other GameInformer people would come on as 1-time guests every now and then, though.\n\nIs MinnMaxx any good? Been out of the gaming podcast game since the Giant Bomb Cast moved off its original group back in 2020 or so. Also loved 1UP Yours back in the day.\n\nTo be fair, 2019 was like 8 months ago I think.\n\nI mean in this age of the internet its pretty hard to be the magazine that is physically in store and be relevant.\n\nA news story needs to break the day of print and even then, by the time you get to shelves theres about 10 updates on the story you are missing.\n\nGame informer used to get a lot of exclusive stuff far into the age of the internet though, that was their business model. They had multi page stories for every game on the cover that always had interviews with the team making the game. Portal 2 was already announced but I believe game informer got the first official visuals. \n\nBefore that no one knew there would be an extremely long time skip and that some of the new aesthetic would be a run down part of the facility with nature creeping in. Everyone just expected a repeat of the first game but with better graphics and more levels. No one knew there was going to be co-op either.\n\nAnd you're essentially a tech magazine, so your target audience is even more tech savvy and prone than the average person. By the time you send out that magazine, they've already watched 10 videos online about whatever you're trying to discuss.\n\nYep, I kept my powerup rewards long after I stopped buying and trading physical copies of games, simply so I could keep my Game Informer subscription.\n\nI stopped it when they wouldn't listen when I told them I only wanted the Print version of the magazine.\n\nI got an email a couple months back saying Game Informer was \"sad I was gone\" and that I should come back soon, as if I didn't cancel my subscription 2 decades ago now\n\nIf we want to be completely fair, Game Informer would have folded ten years ago if not for the fact that GameStop owned it and found it useful as a component of their PowerUp rewards program. From a business perspective it had no reason to exist. Nobody buys magazines anymore including those that love and fondly remember Game Informer.\n\nI remember when they offered me a digital sub with my rewards account and it just kinda killed a little bit of me, like I loved getting something in the mail every week; a digital sub just isn’t the same.\n\nI'm pretty sure they tried. I remember when I was leaving gamestop they were trying to push the digital version of the magazine, but no one cared.\n\nI had a digital subscription for a while. Their viewer was absolute dog shit, needed a specific app to read it and the app wasn't compatible with my Nexus tablet at the time (edit: I just remembered, they didn't support the screen size which is hilariously lazy) so I had to read it on my phone. Then because it was no longer physical, I just began to forget that I got a new GI issue that month. Their articles no longer had unique/unreleased info, most of it would have been leaked/teased prior to the release of the issue.\n\nThey did go completely digital. About two years ago they stopped allowing new subscribers to get anything but digital.\n\nThat changed earlier this year. They were very excited to launch a completely standalone print subscription. No attachment to GameStop or anything else. I got a few issues this way.\n\nDamn, I wish I would have known\n\nI didn't mind reading them, but when they had a digital portion, it was too hard to access. I just stopped bothering with it.\n\nI remember loving gaming magazines back in the 90s and early 00s. Lot of fond memories but it was inevitable with the digital age. \n\n\nNot to mention as the industry grew a lot of it became fluff and just a different type of advertising. Can't really afford to piss off the big companies if you want to see the games early enough to stay relevant.\n\nAhhh the demo discs from that time period. Pc gamer my beloved\n\nThere's a used bookstore here that puts free books outside, and I found a bunch of old PSM magazines. I'm not a big fan of the playstation, but it was a bunch of previews of God of War and Infamous and Killzone..... I couldn't let them rot.\n\nI love looking through them today. So cool.\n\nI went to the doctor's office a few years ago and they had a bunch of old magazines on the table. They were pop culture magazines about celebrities and stuff from the 90s to about 2010. \n\nGossip magazines weren't ever really my thing but it was cool as shit to have them now. It was like reading a time capsule about random months in my childhood. \n\nThe receptionist said they cancelled their subscriptions to magazines around 2010 and just left them out on the table. At first they were just old magazines, but eventually they became so old that people thought it was cool to look back 10 years ago and they became popular. \n\nThe office has been open for many years so they found much older magazines tucked around the place and in storage that weren't thrown away for whatever reason. They put them out and they were a hit. She said some patients even came early specifically to have time to read the magazines while they wait.\n\nThis is why we need to archive *everything* we can. There's so much binality that gets lost to time that is really interesting to go back and see.\n\nThe Unofficial Playstation Magazine (PSM) was always my favorite.  Good news and often hilarious content.  Still have my PS1 lid sticker.\n\n\nAnd of course, passing around Nintendo Power was a staple of every lunch in elementary school.\n\nYeah I mean it’s absolutely mind blowing they lasted this long. But I guess being partnered with GameStop helped for a while.\n\nWriting was on the wall when long-term Editor in Chief Andy McNamara left. Andrew Reiner was/is my favorite reviewer of all time but he was put in charge of a sinking ship.\n\nBy far they absolutely killed it this year. It such a shame to see them go, I used to get so excited for the monthly issue in the mail as a kid (the majority of which I stilll own and are sitting on a shelf in my bathroom) and had the service right up until they switched to digital like a year ago... It was nice that aside from some obviously bias reviews throughout the years that they maintained quality right up until the end. Truly the end of an era.\n\nIt's a relic of a different age at this point. Hell, it's been a relic for a decade. Doesn't mean it's not sad to see it go :')\n\nMan these were the absolute best back in the day. Kinda wish magazines could hold on longer. internet articles and Reddit groupthink don't hit even remotely the same\n\nYup. Always a joy back in elementary school in the early 2000’s. Kids would bring Mad TV, Nintendo power, Shonnen Jump. Glad to have lived to see em.\n\nOh man I remember the excitement I made when I brought that Shonen Jump to middle school. I turned a bully into a friend just by pulling it out. Such good times.\n\nI’m 37 and still pissed that my Nintendo Power  and Lindy’s NFL magazine collection got thrown away by my mom when I moved out at 19.\n\nWhy waste effort, time, and money on well thought articles and cover stories when you can just post some brain dead clickbait trash without all the overhead and make quadruple the money on gamer rage? Journalism across almost all realms has become awful.\n\nEven better, just have AI write the articles for you\n\nWell let's get real and be completely honest right now. That sounds really nice. But when was the last time you had a magazine subscription? If you have been subbed this whole time, then damn that's crappy for you. But I'm willing to bet that all the people agreeing haven't bought even one single magazine in years, so let's get real guys.\n\nThey've been a website as well for years. They're killing that, too.\n\nthat was my point. modern media while convenient doesn't come close to the quality we had. The convenience factor just trumps all unfortunately\n\nHad a subscription for years a decade ago. Sad to see\n\nWait should I cancel mine? I just subbed this month I was wondering why I haven't gotten any updates.\n\nYou forgot to add payment info and now this happened.\n\nDude just single-handedly destroyed the lives of all their employees\n\nI think at this point it's safe to say it's canceled with or without your input\n\nGame Informer going down before some of these other less reputable outlets is wild to me\n\nRIP one of the few generally good ones\n\nGood journalism costs money, bad journalism is cheap\n\nI make it a point to subscribe/contribute to Patreon/BuyMeACoffee to creators that I believe are doing good work. It’s one way to keep good journalism/art alive.\n\nThat contributed to the death of traditional media journalism. \n\nAdblocker is higher on the list of reasons, but companies like Giant Bomb, Waypoint, and Game Informer hired professional full time journalists who lost bad in the attention economy when people like Angry Video Game Nerd and ProJared kicked off the influencer thing.\n\nDon't get me wrong, *some* of those people produce good work, but most are getting their Subs/Donos/Patreon/BuyMeaCoffee money from cult of personality, rather than serious journalism, and the millions who watch them for free now have a new mental price on the value of journalism: $0.\n\nThat's (partly) why the parent companies of Giant Bomb, Waypoint, and Game Informer either shut them down or converted to SEO garbage clickbait content mills.\n\nNot saying you *shouldn't* be a Patron to creators you like, but the broader effect of that model, in my opinion, was an overall negative, and there's no turning back.\n\nMost of the more reputable outlets already declined in quality to the level of their competition. PC Gamer back in the '90s was great. These days it's at the same level as everyone else.\n\nWe even saw this happen online. Remember when Rock Paper Shotgun was new and great? Now they're clickbait trash no different from IGN.\n\nThe founders all left RPS though, and Kieron Gilles (who was always the best writer, at PC Gamer too) became a full time comic book writer. \n\nAnother legend goes away.  Now it can go to magazine heaven and meet Nintendo Power.\n\nMan I had subscriptions to both for the longest time. Have boxes of all my old magazines still… relics of a better time\n\nAgree with the better time.  I used to religiously read these to plan my Christmas shopping list.\n\nMay it say hi to EGM, MAD Magazine and NickMag.\n\nI’m kinda devastated… The end of a era.\n\nGame Informer was by far the fairest with their reviews and commentaries on games; The best writers in gaming.\n\nI think it’s the result of a culture of gaming and the death of proper journalism. IGN lives off click bait but it drives the revenue. I was subscribed to GI for years until I became unemployed. I wish the best for all those guys.\n\nAgreed, they managed to keep integrity for over 3 decades in an industry that has continually been getting worse.\n\nGod damn the website is already gone too. Wasted no time.\n\nWow, was literally on there yesterday. Brutal.\n\nsame I was looking to get a magazine subscription for the year. The economist was $250 and game informer was like $22...almost pulled the trigger too\n\nHa those are the 2 magazines I have subscriptions too as well. Guess it's just down to one now...\n\nMost employees found out via social media that they had lost their jobs.\n\nThey were covering Dragon Age Veilguard Weekly, Rip.\n\nDamn, that's a large number of reviews that have been lost. At least the Internet Archive probably has them, but still sucks it has to be that way.\n\nWHAT?!\n\nGetting those magazines every month was a highlight of my teenage years. That Arkham City cover is legendary.\n\nI remember that one and the halo reach one\n\nYoung gamers who could afford them generally shared. A lot of friendships were made that way.\n\nThere was no cooler feeling than getting home from school and a fresh game informer (or game pro or official Dreamcast magazine) in plastic waiting for you. I would get one and immediately call my best friend and we would go page by page basically having our own podcast about everything. Hours and hours of talking about what was coming out and debating on if it would be as good as they say or if it would get delayed. Then I would go and gently put it on my bookshelf in order with the last one. 🥲 sorry guys having a moment\n\nMaking me a bit misty eyed, bro.\n\nAll good! Def. Having a moment reflecting on my middle school/high school days with this magazine. The thrill os seeing a new rpg or the graphics of the dreamcast, ffx, etc.\n\n[deleted]\n\nI had a bunch from my time working at GS.  Had to toss them when I moved.  I still regret throwing them out.\n\n[deleted]\n\nDecember 2000 was mine for the Matrix game, 25 years of issues, turns out, is heavy as hell lol\n\nGoddamn it, I just subscribed 2 months ago 😭\n\nSame, when they announced coming back to print I was excited. I don't suppose I'll see any of that money back in my wallet though lol.\n\nThey sent an email about offering prorated refunds.\n\nGood to know, thanks! Though I'd honestly rather have the magazines I'm glad they're offering this as well. A sad loss of GI.\n\nYup - when I realized I could subscribe without being tied to Gamestop, I figured it was well worth the \\~$1.25 an issue.  I guess it'll wind up being like $6 for the three I'll have received.\n\nSame here, I've been really enjoying the magazines, this sucks...\n\nI can’t be the only middle aged nerd still getting these? Right everyone? Right?!?\n\nNow what will I read on the toilet? This was the only magazine I get monthly.\n\n40 yo checking in, this is me as well.\n\nIt’s a punch in the gut for sure.\n\nI posted this on the retro gaming sub already, but you aren’t the only one!\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/HQj1jD3\n\nWell, dang. I still subscribe.\n\nI just resubscribed...\n\nRIP. You filled my bathroom with magazines from 2001-2015ish.\n\nThey'll always have that time Ryckert got married at a Taco Bell.\n\nThat was during his first time at Giant Bomb.\n\nWell then they've got nothing.\n\nDan did do an entire let's play of horrible/weird old games with Tim who now works for Capcom. \n\nI remember watching the Overblood 1 and 2 let's play, good times.\n\nThe Dan and Tim era was probably my favorite era of GI. They were great.\n\npeeeeeeeeeeeepoooooooo!\n\nRIP Gamepro.\nRIP Electronic Gaming Monthly.\nRIP Official US Playstation Magazine.\nRIP Game Informer.\n\nRIP to so many memories.\n\nNot shocked, considering gaming journalism is dying. Still sad to see one as big and storied go. \n\nHonestly...where do we go to get good news now? Someone suggested to me Angry Joe and I almost LOL'd out of the convo. Seems like all the big stuff, Game Informer, E3, is all starting to be products of the past.\n\nIf you're a fan of the Game Informer podcast I highly recommend MinnMax! Started by a few Game Informer alums and lots of great content.\n\nI encourage everyone to check out MinnMax. No doubt Ben Hansen will bring up the Game Informer closure next week, and will probably have some game Informer editors on\n\nYou go to YouTubers who are often wildly inaccurate but you have a parasocial relationship with them so that makes them trustworthy \n\nDon't forget if you donate enough you can date them maybe even marry them\n\nOne day Boogie will be mine, just need to scrounge up $20.\n\nIt’s hard. Video game publishers aren’t interested in talking to journalists when you can just pay off a YouTuber or streamer to give you only positive buzz.\n\nThis right here.\n\nNPR, I am not joking.\n\nNPR has a section on gaming that has a bunch of different varied stories and really good Video Game reviews.\n\nIt doesn't necessarily have the most new stuff, but if you really want that then catching up with things like  what are the newest games, there are other places like console YouTube channels.\n\nGameranx is really nice\n\nNextlander, Jeff Gerstmann, Remap Radio, Minnmax, or Giant Bomb\n\nGiant Bomb’s Jeff Grubb does the Game Mess Mornings podcast on the weekdays. It goes over most of the news I care about.\n\nIt’s insane how little actual journalism exists in gaming. The US has like .. one actual journalist (Jason Schreier)? I guess that’s what you get when you let the entertainment industry buy out all journalism outlets )yay capitalism). I’m not talking about podcaster/videocasters, but actual journalism. Plenty of good podcasters, but those are usually only doing opinion pieces/critiques.\n\nI get so so sick of IGN, Gamespot etc. who only functions as the extended arm of the marketing people, and couldn’t ask a an actual critical question to save their life.\n\nwhats gonna happen to the subscriptions we payed for gameinformer was my fav place for game news\n\nYou could kind of see it coming with the content they’ve been putting out over the last couple of years, but man I’m bummed GI was my go to gaming source\n\nYeah it seemed like the writing was on the wall when the last three issues started out with the editor in chief basically begging people to love them and support them. \n\nIt was pretty clear they were getting insanely desperate for subscribers, but I’d read it and be like “what do you want me to do, I have two subs already!” \n\nVery sad indeed because these magazines were a large part of my childhood. \n\nIt’s silly now but pre-internet when you didn’t have cable or even friends or kids in the neighborhoods, and your siblings didn’t want to play with you, and your parents were divorced and had two jobs and were more annoyed at your continued existence because feeding and housing you cost money they didn’t have(just 80s/90s things)…well…I know I’m officially old guy rambling now, but getting a video game magazine in the mail was the best feeling in the world. \n\nI couldn’t afford them so I’d juggle identities using those “get 6 months free” trial cards they came with and they never caught on. \n\nTips and Tricks, Gamepro, PSM later on, Nintendo Power…these were a huge part of my developmental years and I swear kept me going often through harsh times. \n\nKnowing what games were coming and getting peeks at your favorite studios or developers was awesome and fairly unique before Twitter. \n\nSad times indeed, it’s the end of an era!\n\nCrazy to think there's going to be a generation that eventually wont even understand print media. Wait... you'd physically read sheets of paper about something? Then what? Carry it around? Store it? Throw it away? That's so weird!\n\nI find it... slightly discomforting knowing everything is only going to be eventually preserved digitally. With the slightest of effort an \"historical\" record could be changed. Imagine we were all sure a gaming article said one thing about a launch... but hackers or whatever... alter the databases. So now we all have this mandala effect that it said one thing, but the archive says another. Oh well... we must have just remembered wrong!\n\nlol, sorry... got lost in potentially frightening futures here. Hopefully we'll have a failsafe to try and protect against that in the future.\n\nThere was always a certain degree of value in the slower refresh rate of print media. I think a good comparison is the difference between a daily newspaper and a weekly news magazine. The weekly could spend more time on analysis, gathering information, working on longer-form articles. Dailies were focused on just getting the story out, even if it was incomplete and ultimately inaccurate once more was known.\n\nThe problem is we now live in a world that's entirely driven by that latter thought process. Made even worse by the greater speed of dissemination and the 24 hour news cycle.\n\nGetting new updates once a month or so helped to present a better, more holistic picture of things. Even if it was only rumors and gossip, it was still better than endless daily hype with no new information. Content keeps getting shorter, saying less, and being treated as more and more disposable. Nobody even feels the need to put effort into ads the way they used to.\n\nDamnn. IGN must be thrilled, they control a huge chunk of the market\n\nIt doesn't help that when you go onto IGN 90% of what you see is an ad. Not even ads as in an extension of publishers marketing, but literal ads. Basically everything they post is just affiliated links to Amazon where they get a cut of what you buy. It's sad.\n\nrip. last one I remember getting was for Evolve like a decade ago, but rip.\n\nSad.  I remember signing up to get it through GameStop rewards and I thought it was going to kind of cheap.  Nope, it was a 100% legit magazine and I stayed subscribed for years.  Thanks for the effort game informer.\n\nHow long until ign shuts down?\n\nI’m surprised it last this long. But I will always look fondly on the days when I’d see that magazine slide through the door so I can get my once a month hit of gaming updates and that single screenshot of a game I was waiting years to play. \n\nRIP\n\nDamn, that's sad but I'm also surprised it lasted this long.\n\nSomeone got a game informer in the mail during boot camp… I read the same game informer every Sunday for months during our brief “free” time\n\nGameinformer has been my favorite source to look up upcoming games. Their list is concise and easy on the eyes. Sad to see them go.\n\nRIP another physical media\n\nAround 2010 we were about to release a game and tried to send out as many review copies as we could. Game Informer was one of the magazines/sites we could not find an email to submit a mail with a digital download offer for review. We burnt CDs and printed a cover with a letter and sent by regular mail to those places. Game Informer was one crazy f magazine as they actually put that burnt CD into a computer and reviewed the game. It was awesome and helpful, thanks 🙏 to however made those decisions back then.\n\ngrowing up gaming and bmx were my biggest hobbies and I loved keeping up with them through physical print mags and they are all gone now...\n\nThis actually hurts my heart a little bit. Kid me looked forward to getting these in the mail so much 💔\n\nDang looks like their website is already toast. I never read/watched their actual content but they had an incredibly well maintained game release list for each year. Legit is how I kept up with releases since it was just a fat list of every notable release for the year sorted by month.\n\nI'll never forget their issue with Grand Theft Auto: Vice City on the cover. \n\nIt was insanely detailed with more information about the upcoming game than any publication. \n\nGood times.\n\nComing home from school to see a fresh Game Informer in the mailbox was one my favorite surprises as a kid.\n\nThat sucks, I always thought they had legit reviews.\n\nLot of good memories of coming home from school, getting a new game informer in the mail, and then reading it on the toilet haha\n\nI read this magazine endlessly every morning in the school cafeteria before classes began back in the 2000’s.\n\nGetting a new issue with some amazing cool cover was a blessing. \n\nRest in Peace, GI\n\nDamn, that's sad... I used to have a subscription back when they had physical magazines. I remember when the spine used to make a picture if you stacked all the issues in a given year together.\n\nWow this is so sad. I used to tear the covers off of the magazines and pin them all up in my wall. I had one of my walls completed covered with those. It looked so cool. \n\nRIP to a real one 😢\n\nThis legit makes me sad.  Their previews were GOATED\n\nThis was one of the last genuinely good gaming outlets even now and I’ve collected their magazines since 2009. This sucks to see.\n\nWhen they automatically switched my subscription to digital, and I had to go in and request physical copies every year that I renewed, I knew it was only a matter of time.\n\nCloser and closer to dead internet, one site at a time.\n\nI had a feeling IGN would post about this, but I kind of hate it."

    "all_comment_text": "PlayStation's studios give out some of the best photo modes, love the options available in the settings\n\nIt was my favorite part in Days Gone lol\n\nGhost of Tsushimas is up there ☝️\n\nDays Gone is a woefully underrated game\n\n[deleted]\n\nEveryone on this site used to shit on it. Now its been some years, everyone played it and its underrated. Days gone was a great game the whole time\n\nDid it have major bugs at launch perhaps, like most games these days. That could explain the change.\n\nPretty sure most complaints about Days Gone were just janky controls making the game play itself geel annoying and dated.\n\n[deleted]\n\nThe motorcycle handles slow and cumbersome like a bicycle in GTA. Otherwise the controls are fine, imo.\n\nThat’s what makes the riding feel more realistic. You have to anticipate your turns more accurately, and once you get used to it it feels 👌\n\nPeople replying to you and downvoting you don't remember those days or weren't here for it. It wasn't just due to the bugs. People seriously hated the core gameplay and everything to do with the game. Overwhelmingly negative reception all-around. The bugs were just the cherry on top. Popular opinion drastically shifted after the wonderful PC port was released.\n\nAccording to this website just about every game is underrated.\n\nI feel like the current rating is appropriate. Mid seventies on metacritic. There are some issues (especially with the story and how the first act is structured) but overall the game does a lot right and has good gameplay.\n\nThe original launch version on PS4 was rated lower due to its poor technical state.\n\nThat game was way longer than I thought it would be. I did enjoy the \"end game\" of horde hunting\n\nIt's such a smart thing to focus on as well. Every time one of their games releases a photo mode, or even better launches with a photo mode, social media is absolutely flooded with pictures. It's probably the best marketing tool they have.\n\nIt’s grassroots marketing. Let your users be your marketing.\n\nJust look at HellDivers II, word of mouth, the .gifs, memes, and overall scope of it hitting different parts of the internet attracted a lot of players. Price point and no micro transactions to speak of by piece-mealing content or doing predatory purchases necessary.\n\nAdding New Game+ slightly later with extra content doesn’t hurt and keeps players from selling their copies cause they know a round two will commence.\n\nI love that HD2 has actual micro transactions! The skins you can buy in the shop are only like a $1 and you can find the currency in game. It’s a breath of fresh air for sure!\n\nSure, still feels crazy that this is where we are. Where we praise a game for having \"good\" microtransactions.\nA few years ago it would still be an outrage to even include them.\n\nSure, but that was from a time when games also didn't have DLC or any sort of life cycle after release. The live game service system itself isn't inherently predatory, it's simply easy and extremely profitable to make it so. \n\n\nWe should praise the devs for creating new content for the game post-release while also electing not to exclusively lock that content behind paywalls. You can pay to get it immediately if you want, but earning the currency in-game isn't too hard and makes it feel more like you 'earned' that content by being good at the game.\n\n&gt; You can pay to get it immediately if you want, but earning the currency in-game isn't too hard and makes it feel more like you 'earned' that content by being good at the game.\n\nSo you're saying the intent is to provide players with a sense of pride and accomplishment? Why does that sound so familiar?\n\nFor me, it just depends on what kind of game it is. I don’t want micro transactions in my single player rpgs for example. Even if they aren’t expensive, holding stuff out of the base game to nickel and dime us later is gross. I hate loot boxes too. So many games are just straight up predatory.\n\nHelldivers 2 is fun and I really enjoy it, *but* im still baffled people *praise* the paid battlepasses*. And you should be allowed to say it.\n\nI mean they lock gameplay weapons (that could be meta) and mission altering boosters (like \"more reinforcements\", \"less time between enemy encounters\") behind them. Its not \"just cosmetic\". I thought that was cardinal sin of highest order no matter live-service genre? We ok with that when games fun?\n\n*You can earn one paid warbond free if you play 70-100 hours per month, theres new warbond coming out every month. Dev intention is currently 10-30 super credits per hour by playing. 1 000 super credits is 9.99 otherwise. Also the warbond itself gives 300 credits if you \"finish\" it.\n\nDecima engine is insane.\n\n[deleted]\n\nUE5 is amazing but I really wouldn't say they're at the top. I wouldn't call a single engine the best, they have some good competition. \n\nI mean the RE Engine from Capcom looks stunning these days especially with the recent RE4 Remake.\n\nDead Space remake looks stunning, that's on EA/DICE's own Frostbite engine.\n\nSpider-Man 2, relying on Insomniac's own engine looks beautiful \n\nAlan Wake 2 is powered by Remedy's own Northlight Engine, which is breathtaking. \n\nAnd then there's solid competition from Playground Games's engine - ForzaTech. Which looked lifelike on horizon 5 and now looks to be even better in the Fabled reboot reveal. \n\nThis competition is strong, Epic shouldn't singlehandedly power every game. I mean seriously 90% of UE5 games released so far have had very buggy and broken releases. Not saying the engine is bad or anything but it's really not an engine that can do it all I'd argue.\n\nUE5 powered Jedi Survivor and we all know how that game turned out on launch..\n\nSame engine as death stranding, the trailer for death stranding 2 shows off what a completely next gen decima game would look like\n\nI think the Decima engine started with the Killzone series. It's just updated for Horizon since Guerilla used to make Killzone.\n\nKillzone shadow fall was the first to use it, it’s been licensed a few times but yeah it’s Guerilla games in-house engine. It’s kind of like how dice developed Frostbite and EA used it in a bunch of other stuff, but Decima has better implementation so far\n\nWith the exception of Days Gone, all the PlayStation Studios developed games run on their own engines.\n\nYeah I had a lot of fun on Spider-Man 2 making comic book looking photos. Spent so much time in that mode.\n\nGod of war- smiling Kratos \n\nThere's a Twitter account called VPRT Virtual Photo Retweet, they Retweet many people's photos from various game, through them I found some users named GwynVP and Keng inGamePhoto. They post great Screenshots that are even worthy of being wallpapers. I posted some over at /r/Amoledbackgrounds\n\nGran Turismo 7's photo mode, in my opinion, is the best of the bunch for two reasons. For one, the mode was designed with the help of Sony's camera division, so the settings are the same ones you'd find on an actual camera. More importantly, instead of just using the console's built-in screenshot system, GT7 instead has you press triangle to re-render the entire scene at the highest possible settings (to the point where it can take a few minutes to render some shots). Combined with the earlier bit about actual camera controls (which includes simulated pan, and shutter speed ), you can take shots you normally could not just using the in-game camera, including [dramatic ones with light trails in low light](https://www.thefourthfocus.com/post/gran-turismo-7-light-trails-guide).\n\n[removed]\n\n[deleted]\n\nstop or i'll get a hand fetish\n\nToo late\n\nOk, thanks. I'm gonna cum now.\n\nusername checks out?\n\nThe hero we don't need.\n\nToo late\n\nGOT CUUUUUM IN HIS EEEEYEEEESSSSS\n\nMy name is Yoshikage Kira. I’m 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don’t smoke, but I occasionally drink. I’m in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I’m trying to explain that I’m a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn’t lose to anyone.\n\nWhat a\n\nbeautiful\n\nduwang\n\nchew\n\nHayato\n\nYou called?\n\nNo, wait what the fu\n\nDon't you already have one you wanker?\n\nNot safe for Vorinism\n\nSame way with the original. I'm still in awe of how amazing that game looked on the PS4.\n\nThe console of my teenage years was the PS2. When I saw DOA~~3~~ 4 (and the, hmm, accompanying volley ball game) on XBOX360, and John Carmack showing off Doom 3 real-time lighting and shadows on Macworld ~~the same year~~ a few years before, I thought \"computer game graphics couldn't possibly get any better than this\".\n\nThis screenshot, coming from a game engine that could run 60+FPS ^(on a good rig) would have been unthinkable for me in 2001.\n\nEdit: Mixed up some of the dates. Memories started congealing together in my old age.\n\nSame.  \n\nWent to dream about PC when they were 386 stocked, ready assembled i the shops.  \n\nSeen Doom demo runing on them and thought  *Wow!! Reality is seaping slowely to PC games*  \n\nThen VooDoo cards came out and my friend showed me Need For Speed 2 on it.  \n\nI think i fainted.\n\nI was sick and had a fever when I played Final Fantasy VIII for the first time. The CGI videos and invoking a G-Force in real time graphics made me feel like I had a fever dream. It couldn't be real life.\n\nTo be fair, Photos modes are not using the same render as the game, they usually jack up every settings and don't run at 60fps.\n\nThat's because photos are 1 frame per forever.\n\nIt's still usually &lt;1 second to produce the frame which is still mind-boggling when just 2 decades ago it would take an entire render farm hours-days to produce a similar level of quality image.\n\nSeriously, she has cuticles. That's insane.\n\nPhoto mode practically renders a whole new game\n\nIt's the fingernails for me that are really selling it. Seen countless incredibly detailed character models but fingernails always look mediocre. Hers actually looks real. It's insane. The game didn't do much for me but it was damn stunning\n\nI bought this game as a drunk purchase while out buying more beer, by the time I started playing it, I was so hammered that I legit went through cut scenes forgetting it was game and thinking I was playing a movie. It really is the best looking game ever made, hands down.\n\nWhat really amazed me in this game was the facial work during conversations. Incredible.\n\nPhoto modes in games have higher graphic quality than actual game. Developers include that mode in their games, so people share fake bullshots on social media instead of real pictures.\n\nCertainly not to a meaningful degree for Tsushima or Cyberpunk, both of those games are gorgeous in and out of photo mode\n\nI have no idea how you guys get her to strike these poses but nice shot!\n\nIt must be a feature exclusive to the photo mode. I've 100%'d the game and never once had a tutorial or anything about being able to make these poses (I never used photo mode).\n\nIt is, there's like 20 different poses, there's also facial expressions to pick from.\n\nPhoto Mode allows you to change almost anything. Poses, facial expressions, face paint, time of day, lenses, filters, etc.\n\nFor instance, without exiting the menu, OP could have changed this to make her scowl while making heart hands under the moon. \n\nI'm particularly fond of the time of day shots 'cause shifting the sun/moon to light her face/silhouette *just right* is fantastic.\n\nAlso the photo mode increases the quality of everything so you won't get this at actual gameplay. Still, the scenery in gameplay it's beautiful.\n\nThis is the type of quality game that keeps me gaming after 40 years. Although I finished the game several days ago I kept playing on exploring and delving into caves etc, but yesterday I finally uninstalled it. A great game. Thanks for sharing the cool screenshot.\n\nI finished the other day, absolutely loved the game. Now I'm debating to either uninstall or start a new game plus on ultra hard, but I know I'll very much get my ass handed to me.\n\nHere I am with 100hrs on Zero Dawn and 100hrs on Forbidden West...still playing them both.\n\nIm reading Murakami now, and I find some strange connection between this comment and Murakami's writing. Dunno why, but it felt super familiar. Going back to the book. \n\nAlso, i love games and I hope I'll never stop as well. Have an awesome Sunday.\n\nMurakami loves the exploration of dark tight spaces. \n\nI'd never heard of Murakami before, but just did a quick Google search. Shall take your comment as a compliment. Hope you have an awesome Sunday too.\n\nIt was the first game for me in a very long time that I didn't instantly lose interest in after finishing the main story. Normally no matter how hooked I am on a game, doing every little thing, the moment I finish the story, my brain just decides it's over it. But not for this game! I was having so much fun just doing essentially nothing, wondering around the map, taking pictures, etc. \n\nI never fast travelled either, so sometimes the whole session that night would just be me going from one location to another, but I enjoyed every second.\n\nOne of the very, very few open-world games I even played to 100% completion! It was just so well done and high-quality, I had a ton of fun!\n\nSince I've gotten older and started working I tend to not even touch games after getting the credits roll (if I even make it that far), but everything about this game is so gorgeous that I kept going to do everything for the plat just so I could continue appreciating the scenery. Ridiculous how good the game looks.\n\nIt's definitely a good one to explore in.  I think I'm about 60-70 hours in and I've only just gotten to &gt;!San Francisco!&lt;\n\nI bought the game on pc on Day 1 at full price. Happy to say no regrets. Game is amazing and runs smooth\n\nDelving? Must be AI generated.. jk, this is thr one context where its commonly used lol\n\nplough forgetful person rob north disarm steer chubby tie snails\n\nRight? I remember getting Super Mario Bros. 3 for my 5th birthday. It's crazy to think about.\n\nReally awesome shot, thanks for sharing it!\n\nThe fact people call Aloy ugly is nuts 😭\n\nI'd argue that it doesn't matter whether she's ugly or not, because the plot of the game doesn't revolve around that and whoever plays the game and focuses on her appearance is missing the point. It's about killing robot dinosaurs, people.\n\nCorrection: it’s about making robot dinosaurs kill each other, then watching and commentating like it’s Robot Wars.\n\nNothing more gratifying than Hacking an enemy into a friendly, especially one that can be mounted and used as batter ram to boot. Shoot arrows from your mount, circle back, jump off for the kill with your spear while your new buddy goes be backup to keeping other enemies busy. Hilarious how the AI goes “gotchu fam” and 10 seconds earlier was hunting for me.\n\nThis is exactly why I love almost any game that lets me do CC+charm builds viably. I don’t wanna fight, I wanna spend the game Joe Roganing all of the enemies fighting each other.\n\nMy entire strategy is turn the biggest one to my side and then break out the popcorn\n\nAs a monster hunter fan, i can tell you people absolutely treat \"being pretty/hot\" as equal if not greater than the\"killing things\" part.\n\nFashion Hunters are valid! What's the point of killing things and harvesting their parts of not to look good wearing those parts?\n\nGreetings from fashion souls! What's the point of dying over and over again if we don't look fabulous?\n\nSalutations from Fashion's Dogma! I'd rather have aught of style than aught of use!\n\nFashion Fantasy XIV: \"Amateurs\".\n\nTo be fair you're talking about a group of people whos sole identity and profit revenue relies on being outraged by anything and everything. Hence why they proclaim everything from cartoons and snack mascots to games to be \"woke\" while not even having a clear definition of what \"woke\" means. \n\nJust ignore the ramblings of morons. And we should never cater to morons. because they just drag rest of us down with them.\n\nConsidering approximately 65% of her outfits have her midriff showing, I think her looks were certainly among the design considerations.\n\nEveryone knows that part doesn't need armor\n\nVery good point\n\nThe one big thing bother me about her design is her ABSOLUTE THICC amount of hair like GOD DAMN wish i had like half of that.\n\nHer hair must be like 10kg weight total\n\nWhen does she even braid that stuff? Come to think of it, when does she sleep? My Aloy's been awake for months now.\n\nthats just the way the devs tried to make her hair dynamic and flowing while keeping it optimized. It looks great in motion but Id like to see hair graphics evolve beyond the cards system we have in games right now. \n\nTomb raider reboots had strand type hair. why havent more games adapted that?\n\n&gt; It looks great in motion \n\nIn motion it looks like her hair is made out of friction-less air balloons. Hair does not behave like that.\n\nStrand hair is really hard to make look good, especially with anti-aliasing and image upscaling, and it's extremely resource-intensive\n\nExactly what I have always been thinking, like are people actually blind?\n\nThey are also always passing around an edited picture that made her more bloated looking, so being entirely disingenuous.\n\nI think she’s the perfect middle ground for beautiful but not catering to fan service. Shes basically what people would want the fable MC in the trailers to be.\n\nthey want Aloy to be more like 2b, Acheron from HSR and the Stellar Blade MC and less normal person. Chuds were such weebs Yoko Taro would have poked fun at them.\n\nIt would be so boring if every female character was like that. We need our 2Bs and our Aloys, variety is the spice of life. Aloy isn't even plain, she's pretty, just not in a hypersexualized way.\n\n(I'd also argue that we're lacking in funny looking female characters, you don't find those even among the supporting or background cast while there are plenty of memorable funny looking male characters.)\n\nNot blind.\n\nIdeologically motivated. (Or financially motivated).\nThere's an entire political industry based on feeding and catering to the belief that the Evil SJW's are out to get you.\n\nIts not people, its incels with brain damage.\n\nsome men have never seen a woman in real life\n\nI remember that twitter post asking why Aloy has a beard when it's just that white fluff everyone has\n\nyup, that's what i mean.\n\nYou won't believe the amount of people I have talked to say she needs to look like Korean MMO female.... what do gamer smokes nowadays\n\nSomeone on gamingcirclejerk edited a picture of Aloy so she had full make up and basically looked like she was in a fashion magazine. \n\nPeople missed the point and reposted it with \"let fans make games\" acting like a woman in a dystopian robot dinosaur world should be running about like she's about to hit the catwalk at Paris fashion week.\n\nDoes anyone feel that her head is a bit too big compared to rest of her body? I get a bobblehead feeling when looking at her ingame sometimes\n\nIt was worse in the flashbacks when she was a child, it felt very off.\n\nIt def is big. She has the anime character proportions. Could be the devs trying to showcase her facial expressions better. But it does look off sometimes\n\nYou're getting gaslit, I see it too.\n\nGaslighting is when other people disagree with me\n\nNo.\n\nYeah Aloy is really pretty. Especially if you consider her circumstances and all. \n\nShe's literally living in a post apocalyptic world so I'd wager being all made up and stuff isn't really one of her priorities lmfao\n\nIt's a fucked up expectation that if you aren't super model, after 4 hours of make up and 20 hours of photoshop pretty, then you're ugly. \n\nHow that expectation ever came about is beyond me.\n\nedit: Wow, whole lotta incels in this thread.\n\nGingers\n\nThe only people saying this are incels lol\n\nWell those are the same people who think a game is only good if all the female characters have big tits and thicc asses. How dare they make Aloy actually look like a woman who's been out in wilds. Rosy toughened skin? How dare they! Lol. Agree man, those are some special people\n\n[removed]\n\nThe people who do are chronically online weebs who think all women look like anime girls and k-pop stars.\n\nThought this was a real person at first\n\nI'm a real world photographer and...holy crap.\n\nI played both games last year. The amount of detail in the secone one is pretty insane.\n\nThe ginger avenger!\n\n[deleted]\n\nHorizon Forbidden West cranked up both of those aspects to be fair. Plays more like Monster Hunter than before but you also have a ridiculous amount of customizations + photo mode settings to play around with.\n\nPlays  more like *Monster Hunter?* Damn, now I REALLY need to get a  new PC!\n\n*Neuron Activation*\n\nI sometimes feel like people aren’t crazy enough about how ridiculously good this game looks. There’s is nothing like it at that scale. Not even close really. Down to the smallest details. I’ve never seen a fucking [rock texture](https://x.com/truegamer1111/status/1587365335413493760?s=46&amp;t=l-kSnFATl3Y-pVcpu2K5gA) as insane as this in an actual game that’s not some Engine Tech Demo.\n\nI instantly think of this game when I see devs release a product that doesn't run well or offer a performance option on consoles. Still one of the best looking games you can play.\n\nYeah to think that a cross gen title is still the best graphics showcase on consoles and arguably PC too for Open World games is crazy.\n\nWhat the fuck dude - all videos of this game I ever see focus on blurry action and detailed human character models and their animation (which all looks great, don't get me wrong), so I've never seen this before\n\nYou won't believe how nice the beaches are. It has actual real waves, and sand that deforms to your footsteps.\n\nSeeing the environments in this game for yourself on a proper TV or Monitor is unlike anything else really.\n\nThe Decima Engine is truly incredible.\n\nI have no idea how anyone could think Aloy is ugly. She's no glamour model, sure, but she's 1000% more stunning than anyone with her backstory and motivations would ever care to maintain. \n\n\nHonestly a fully lore-accurate Aloy would probably look more like Hagar the Horrible.\n\nShe doesn't look like a genshin character that's why they find her ugly\n\nFunny you say that [she actually is a Genshin character](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Aloy). Not one that shows up in the story or anything, just one you can play as.\n\nLmao I thought only fortnite have every character in existence\n\ngamers want Aloy to look like a DoA character.\n\n&gt; DoA\n\nNow that's a name I haven't heard in 15 years...\n\nDoA5LR can be playable on any low-end PC and Extreme Venus Vacation is available free on Steam. 6 killed the franchise because of overpriced skins worth US$ 1,300.00.\n\nShock: 15 year olds don’t actually know what beauty is. More at 11.\n\nThere were plenty of grown-ass men throwing a temper tantrum about Aloy being 'ugly'.\n\nHer personality is what immediately made her uninteresting for me \n\nStill played both games tho since they are good but yeah \n\nIn terms of feeling something for a fictional character I disliked her\n\nThe photo modes in games these days are so good, it's actually gotten me more interested in actual photography, shot composition, lens settings, etc.  Game photography is one of my favorite hobbies now\n\nBeautiful photo. I'm playing through this game right now. Just did the desert area with the flooded base underground.\n\nPicked this up by basically accident. Its one of the best games ive ever played in my life. And a testament that AAA done right is a magnificent thing. Adored it. Still on my first playthru enjoying every frame.\n\nWhile I fully understand everyone has preference, I can't take someone who said she looks like a man seriously because I know they get that opinion from ONE edited image (you know the one)\n\nI haven’t played Forbidden West in a while, I genuinely can’t believe how realistic the skin looks\n\nThe photo mode is not indicative of the actual game at all. Everything in photo modes is upscaled and it has vastly better picture quality because it only has to render that one frame.\n\nIt's so gorgeous I wish the game was fun\n\nThe gameplay in this game is so fun. Even better than in the first game.\n\nThe only lacking aspect is mystery and exploration. I loved exploring HZD. HFW is pure fun too and exploration is good, but isn't as exciting. Maybe it's because I saw such world for the first time. Overall , it delivers what a sequel should !\n\nAgreed. The mystery and story in HZD is incredible, one of the best in video games imo, but the plot of HFW fell flat for me. Gameplay was definitely better in HFW and I think the side quest design was also improved, but a lot of the new stuff just felt like clutter. Hopefully the third game will be the best of both worlds.\n\n[deleted]\n\nIt does probably. Photo mode I assume is treated like a real time cutscene. Would only make sense to put the hero model in there that would be used for cutscenes and dialoge sequences.\n\nThat being said, if you zoom into pretty much anything during gameplay it is almost always ridiculously detailed in Horizon Forbidden West. Their asset and texture quality is insane.\n\nUndoubtedly, the Horizon series are some of the technically greatest looking games you can get your hands on.\n\n\nYet they're thrashed by BOTW/TOTK and Elden Ring, 3 games which have significant 'worse' graphics, simply because they're more fun.\n\nIt's subjective. People claimed that Horizon Zero dawn was buried by Breath of the Wild and then it turns out to be one of the most successful Playstation games of all time.\n\nSo clearly a lot of people thought it was a fun game.\n\nZero Dawn and BOTW are both amazing games and I'm glad I played both to completion. I'm finishing TOTK and have Forbidden West waiting for me!\n\nSmash\n\n\"Aloy ugly\"\n\nShe looks better than your mom.\n\nThat's a really low bar.\n\nReminds me of those CG wallpapers from the early 2000s. Remember? Oh and there were premium sites of wallpapers. Crazy times.\n\nany bets this mostly gonna be used for gravure shots?\n\nSomething is a little off about that pinky possition.\n\nCool\n\nOkay, am I just dumb? How do you get her to lay down and play in the water to take a photo?\n\nI see all these things in photo mode that are things that I've never seen aloy even do.\n\nPoses.\n\nYou can change them and facial expressions too. But, you have to be not in a cut scene if I'm remembering it correctly.\n\nAs long as you’re not gliding or in a cutscene, there’s a pose selection menu in the photo mode.\n\nwish i could get into the games, maybe i should give it another try.\n\nHell nah! This is amazing!\n\nRdr2 photo mode is great\n\nI spend a ridiculous amount of time in photo mode on that game. In fact it was photo mode in the first game that got me into photography in real life! Although it's much harder in real life when you can't just pan the camera around all over the place.\n\nGod damn! I still remember seeing my brother play Resident Evil, FF7 and Tekken.\n\n \"Imagine we could play with the CG graphics!\"\n\nWe are so fucking beyond that! \n\nToo far??? Remember setting a booby trap in The Last of Us 2. Bodies torn in half, guts spilling out. The blood splatter. \n\nActually felt a \"Karen pang\" haha, One of the goriest things I've witness in a game. \"oh my....\"\n\nThe game has a lot of structural weaknesses in the RPG elements but it is phenomenal as an action game and has unbelievable graphics. I just spend a couple minutes just flying over the burning shores and taking it in.\n\nI wonder if the next game is going to close out the PS5 or herald in the PS6.\n\nShe reminds me of Amy Lee from Evanescence\n\nDamn, she does\n\nThe problem that horizon is reaaaaally boring to play\n\nWish she wasn’t wearing flip flops\n\nWish she was barefoot 🤤\n\nAmazing\n\nThe game is dull\n\nAloy is comfortably the best lead character in a game for decades. Outstanding story, incredible gameplay. It’s just superb.\n\nAloy is certainly good, but \"comfortably the best lead in decades?\" Come now. Be reasonable.\n\nYou cannot convince me, for even a singular nanosecond, that a PS5 Pro is a necessary upgrade that will somehow improve upon this."

I can hear it!\n\n\"father help\"\n\nThey fly now\n\n[deleted]\n\nWhen the acid hits and you realize you never went on a walk and you're still in your bed\n\nI don't need acid to experience that.On some mornings when I really don't wanna get up,I get up in my dreams,go wash my face,get ready and then I wake up and have to do it all again\n\nOne day I got up, got ready, went to school and had all my classes, and the bell rang for the end of the school day. That was my alarm to wake up to go to school\n\nAnd that day is miserable because you've been up for 8 hours before your eight hours of school, and you've learned new things (some of them bull shit dream stuff you don't remember but your brain doesn't care).\n\nTwo days of school back to back before going home is hell.\n\nI've had that in false awakening loop dreams, and they're absolute hell. Wake up, do stuff (sometimes normal, sometimes ending up in dream nonsense), and wake up again... And again. And again. I don't get them *super* often, thankfully, but they really leave me with a feeling of questioning what's reality and what's a dream.\n\nThough, there was one time in a particularly long cycle (at least 20 false awakenings) where I was able to lucid dream for a bit because I realized that I was still asleep and dreaming, so that was neat, it's so far the only time I've been able to lucid dream. Normally the loops are more or less the same, but when I became lucid I was able to change what was happening and while I couldn't do it again in the next loop, I was able to actually wake up pretty quickly after.\n\nCheck out the concept of \"reality checks\" if you haven't already. If you get in the habit of doing it when you're awake, eventually it'll occur to you to try it when you're dreaming. Normally people use them to lucid dream, but maybe it can help you\n\nI have that too except I’m lucid during those dreams. It’s so incredibly frustrating/scary to desperately want to wake up but you keep waking up in a new dream. Killing myself in the dream only makes me wake up in another dream.\n\nactually made me laugh out loud, how everyone living the same lives 🤣\n\nNo, not everyone drops acid.\n\nThem Death Stick do be hitting a lot more differently\n\nNeed to go home and rethink life.\n\n🤣🤣🤣🤣\n\nDamn it, Rose!\n\nProbably shoulda been delayed a bit to fix up these bugs. But that's Ubisoft for ya.\n\nI imagine they wanted this release slot since low competition\n\nSeptember will be absolutely stacked tho, Space Marine 2, GOW Ragnarok, FF 16... If you add WOW and Wukong wich just came out it's a paradise for single players, Outlaw has some real competition rn\n\nGow ragnarok??\n\nPC release, I had to look it up to thinking I missed something.\n\nYeah annonced for the 19\n\nAs Always with pc ports, they do not advertise and announce at last minute lmao, it was the same with gow 1\n\nI mean do you need to? Just drop it on steam and the steam algo does it's thing.\n\n&gt;\\*me opening steam one day seeing Horizon Forbidden West\\*\n\n&gt;Oh nice! Today? Well, guess Imma go play HFW.\n\nI mean I wouldn't say no to a better heads up but...\n\nIt was indeed a very good surprise, especially having both FF and GOW dropping with like 2 days interval\n\nYeah Marcus from Gears of War finds a hive tunnel that is actually a portal that sends him back to a mythological norse realm, where he has to lancer chainsaw viking-age locusts. The locusts are trying to circumvent Ragnarok by trying to save their queen through the portal that Marcus came from.\n\nDon't forget Astro Bot\n\nI mean.. Concorde was just released.\n\nyeah… concord isn’t exactly ‘competition’\n\nWait, I thought they were sarcastic. They were sarcastic right\n\nNo. They are one of the active players of Concorde. Sorry I mean the only player of Concorde.\n\nYou better put some respect on the best player ever of a 100 million dollar game.\n\nIf those under 700 people could read they'd be really upset right now!\n\nIn all fairness, they could've released it later and still had low competition, the landscape for star wars games is dry right now.\n\nAs always it’s the Star Wars mods that are the best, and a great one for Insurgency Sandstorm has just released. Luckily it’s not seen as competition (yet) so hopefully it won’t be taken down!\n\nIt is normal for a license-based game: there is a limit time to release and has to be rushed, everything is cut down to bare bones and some things are slapped on top. \"See? We used the license!\"\n\nHappens every time developer gets a license to a movie franchise.\n\nOk, one exception is Batman Arkham series. And Shadow of Mordor. And.. Dammit! You made me lose my point here!\n\nthe newer terminator games have been good too, transformer and most spiderman games. \n\nyou get some real shit most the time but, there are a few that are almost always decent enough.\n\nI heard that new Robocop game was INCREDIBLE.\n\nIt’s really good. I didn’t think I’d like it as much as I did. Solid game\n\nMan Terminator Resistance is solid, been playing through it mainly for the music\n\nI still wonder how the same studio that made Syrian Warfare got a pass for Terminator Dark Fate\n\nSpiderman does have the benefit of Sony owning the license and Sony making the video game.\n\nPlus, it's set in a very specific location that doesn't really change, so a lot of reuse can happen. \n\nIn reality, most licensed games are auctioned off to a team whose goal is to spit out some passable star wars game to make whatever money they can from the fan base. Good doesn't apply, the low cost + star wars = easy profit.\n\nThe games are an entirely separate license from the movies, and the fact that it's Spiderman on a Sony console is happenstance.\n\nAs for the game license itself, Marvel wanted to move away from the movie tie-in games and build a new universe with actually good games, largely inspired by how well the Arkham games did. Nintendo weren't considered a viable candidate for this, MS wasn't interested, but Sony wanted in. When Sony and Marvel approached Insomniac Games about it, they allowed IG to pick any character they wanted, and the general consensus in the studio was Spidey. This was also before Sony aqcuired IG, which happened a year after the first game released.\n\nThis is pretty much the reason we got this game. Push from Disney and Ubisoft’s laziness. Massive is a great studio that is marred by corporate entities pushing immovable deadlines. \n\nThe game is fun, I’m enjoying my time with it in a brain dead kinda way - but the AI is a fucking joke, it HAS to be fixed in a patch. They cannot leave it as is. \n\nAlso, I wish some of the features were a little bit more fleshed out. Also, if I’m a smuggler criminal bastard - why can’t I just steal anyone’s speeder ? Why MUST it be my shitter little speeder from my broken spaceship?\n\nThat's why I think I will play it in about six months from now\n\nI thought that after I played Star field but however long it has been I still don't think they recovered properly, I hope they can prove me wrong though\n\nThe main problem with Starfield is the dogshit writing, worldbuilding, aesthetics, and quest design, and those aren't things that are ever getting fixed. Fixing Starfield would require going back in time 6+ years and having both Todd and Emil fired and replaced with competent leads with actually good ideas and also hiring a team of writers instead of leaving it all to one hack.\n\nThere's a joke in League of Legends esports that a bad team only need to work on: and they start listing everything.  \n\nSeem like that could be applied here.\n\nI do the same for Just about any open world game. Didn't play Jedi Survivor until earlier this year and loved it, but that also means I'm really not in the mood for another open world Star Wars game any time soon. I'll play it when/if it comes to Game Pass one day.\n\nSame, really. Almost every one of them publishes in a very raw state. Hell, even Witcher 3 took like 15 gigabytes of patches to be really polished after version 1.13, I think this was the one I've read about that made me finally pick up that game\n\nArkham had pretty bad pc ports\n\nArkham Knight got pulled twice from Steam because of performance issues and bugs\n\n&gt; Ok, one exception is Batman Arkham series.\n\nI remember Arkham Knight at least launching in a notoriously bad state, and I don't know how long it took for that to be patched into a decent-ish state since I only played it years later after getting the trilogy free on epic.\n\nArkham Knight was practically unplayable on launch on a lot of computers.\n\nEhm, Baldur's Gate 3 is a license-based game, also Witcher 3. It has nothing to do with licensing and everything to do with the dev. It's not like Ubisoft hasn't done exactly this with their other franchise games either.\n\nUnless you count PC Arkham games lol\n\nSpider-Man 2 had loads of bugs. Many of which required me to reset the game itself. People joked about them, but didn't throw a stink about the over all quality of the game.\n\nIf this game wasn't made by Ubisoft, the reception would be quite a bit different I think\n\nGamers are such selective hypocrites these days.  Baldur's Gate 3, a party based rpg, launched with two party member's dialogue fucking broken resulting in something like a thousand lines of dialogue not playing at all.  Larian didn't fix it for over 6 weeks.  10 outta 10!  Game of the generation!\n\nIm not defending the game but i've genuenly not had a single bug except 1 flickering bush. I genuenly think most of the bugs are old drivers or systems that simply can't run the game\n\nWhy not defend it then?\n\nI'll defend it.\n\n The game is a ubisoft Star Wars game. Like every game in existence, it's repetitive and the enjoyment a player has is based on their enjoyment of the repetitive mechanics. Ubisoft packs their games to the gills with content and mechanics and I have no idea why people don't want that. Nobody's forcing them not to stick to the main story! You mess with the bloat, you deserve the bloat and have no realistic reason to complain while keeping up the facade that you're an adult!\n\nYou universal, not you Gold dinosaur of friendship and love.\n\nDefend your enjoyment and damn the capital G gamers who come for ya\n\nThis isn't exactly a game breaking bug. There's no reason to delay it over something this minor.\n\nI've been playing and so far the game seems fine and nice to play. People like to bitch about anything. That specific bug 0.00000000000001% of people did that\n\nThe bug in the video isn't even a real bug. They entered a level that you aren't supposed to be able to leave, and then they tried leaving. It's essentially a big invisible wall that you happen to be able to traverse on your vehicle, but it's never something you would ever need to do in normal gameplay. You slide down the hill and then continue on to the level, you don't try to ride back up the hill, there's no point to trying to do it.\n\nBug testers go out of their way to try to break games...\n\nAnd gamers will always try to go the \"wrong way\" in games.\n\nWith more QA time, this is the *exact* kind of bug that would be noticed and fixed\n\n\"There's no reason to do that, so the bug doesn't count\" is a view that is very limited.\n\n&gt; With more QA time, this is the exact kind of bug that would be noticed and fixed\n\nI'm sure they had already noticed that bug but it was classified as low priority.\n\nBut that's the point, it's something most players will never see. He is coming through an exit area, I just played this part yesterday. Normally you are leaving a story mission and you slide down that hill. So he decided to go up the hill and back in. Rode up it on the bike, got off the bike, amd slid down while still in the getting off the bike animation. It's almost like the player was trying to force it to bug out. Ive been playing 8 hours and haven't seen anything like this. Not saying the game is perfect. But this isn't proof the game is a bloody mess. It would be like if I did an ash of war animation next to a cliff in elden ring that cancels fall damage and said \"look how buggy this game is\"\n\nYeah, I played it pretty much all day today (unusual for me. I just couldn't put it down) and I haven't encountered a single bug yet.\n\nYep, one person has a bug that Ill never see and people go crazy.\n\nI've been having a blast.\n\nIt’s wild how many comments on gameplay videos I’ve seen, gameplay of a pretty okay open world game set in the Star Wars universe (with pretty impressive vistas and settlements might I add), are nothing but variations of “Who would buy this fucking trash? One of the worst games ever made, I’ll buy it when it’s $15”.\n\nIt’s comical how many people are trashing it but still say they’re going to buy and play it.\n\nbasically almost every AAA studio, no need to call out Ubisoft here tbh\n\nI don't think it'll hurt them much. That's fair though, it's not just Ubisoft, there are a lot of AAA studios that are similar.\n\nWhy bother when the average gamer is more than willing to pay 120+ dollars for them to half ass it?\n\nIt's really not that much of an issue.\n\nOh that came out?\n\nOnly if you paid extra money for early access.\n\n~~early access~~ beta testing\n\nAre you implying that they collect feedback to improve the game by launch? Hah\n\nWho said the launch was the end of the Beta test?\n\nPub G has entered the chat\n\nOr they may be a smart person and just paid for Ubisoft+ for one month to play the game instead of forking out over $100 for the ultimate edition version. \n\nEarly access and only paying 18 bucks or whatever? Sounds like the way to go when they are serving up buggy shit like this.\n\n&gt;Sounds like the way to go when they are serving up buggy shit like this.\n\nYou know who don't have to eat the slop right?\n\nThat's what you get for paying extra to be a beta tester\n\n\"Its only $160!\"\n\nI wouldn’t even pay that for Elden Ring or BG3 and I can make a pretty strong argument that those games are actually worth that price tag.\n\nBeta cuck testers at this point\n\nYeah. It's Ubisoft.\n\nNot to mention it's Star Wars. We haven't had a Star Wars game with a stable launch in like 15 years.\n\nSquadrons was pretty stable, no?\n\nI literally forgot that game existed.\n\nRight now you can mod Starfield into the best unofficial star wars game....I guess it's something right?\n\nYou can probably do that with Skyrim too!\n\nBugs are to be expected at this point.\n\nIt's just a unique \"Feature\"!\n\n$50 for season pass! Another $30 expansion not included!\n\nYeah, the seasons changed. Duuuuuh!\n\nThey're a Ubisoft feature (and Bethesda of course)\n\n“Why Bethesda bugs are good and ubibugs are bad, more at 11”\n\nIt's also Guerilla and Insomniac. They release notoriously buggy games at launch. And at best they get meme'd and some chuckles.\n\nPeople keep complaining about prices and policy, only to go ahead and but the next 200€ \"special mega its gonna work for sure\" edition as soon as it is announced. Just fucking stop buying their shit, and they have to get it together. They wont of people just eat up whatever they crap out.\n\nYou act like it's only like that because of that. Literally every game has bugs in some way or anothe\n\nOnce you get the bunny hop upgrade for your speeder you’d be able to make this just fine. \n\nNo I’m not kidding. \n\nBut yeah the sliding is funny.\n\nMake sure to preorder so you can beta test for Ubisoft.\n\nI think you have to preorder the edition that costs double the price of the base game to even do that\n\nthat's no bug it's a space station\n\nI, too, heavily dissociate when anything goes wrong in life.\n\nIt looks like you're intended to \"slide\" down the path, but exiting the scooter locked your animation. \n\nActually looks kinda nit-picky. Super specific way to get a bugged animation, not surprising it didn't get caught by QA.\n\nYou are correct. This is the exit area for a story mission. When you escape the area you slide down this hill. It's almost like OP is trying to make the game bug out to get a video and say \"look how buggy the new ubisoft game is\" I'm i hours into it, amd it's honestly a fun ass game. Is it Elden Ring game of the decade type game? Nope. But I am enjoying it.\n\nWhat's next, a video about someone getting out of bounds and complaining the game is broken?\n\nI see it’s running at buttery smooth 15 fps, huh.\n\nThis *video* game sub doesn't allow video for some godforsaken reason\n\ncomplicated video turned into a gif will do that.\n\nAnd recording a video will help too.\n\nIs that why it looks like it's running on a PS3?\n\npretty much yea. I havent seen actual gameplay but the FPS, and resolution is affected by the GIF.\n\nI thought the game was just tanking fps lol it legit looks like Xbox 360. I’m still gunna play this game but like after a couple updates. Maybe wait for it to be on sale.\n\nOkay, not defending the game here, but how on earth can you draw that conclusion from a gif?\n\nConfirmation bias\n\nWhy is this shit upvoted? It's literally GIF on your screen.\n\nlol no it runs about 90fps with DLSS and max RT at 1440p on a 4080S/7800x3d\n\nHow did this get 500 upvotes? It's a gif not the actual game.\n\nI can’t stop laughing at this entire thread.\n\nSociety in a nutshell. People who have no interest or knowledge of something shitty on it for internet points.\n\nSad but thats def become video game discourse this past year\n\nEvery year since the dawn of the internet, and it seemingly will never change, sigh.\n\nMaybe the way algorithms on social media have been tuned for profit this has become the case even more so now. Maybe because Reddit, Game Forums and even 4ch have some form pf containment for the various communities as opposed to twitter or youtube where you're just recommended stuff based on the algorithms.\n\nIt's a gif, not a 4k video\n\nLooks like you are tech illiterate\n\nis that a bug or a no-backtracking path working as intended? What do you want? a slipping down a hill animation?\n\nIt looks like it's just missing the animation after getting off the speeder. Everything else working as intended here\n\nYeah it's barely a bug. If this is the biggest bug someone has to showcase, then I'd say the game is doing pretty well.\n\nFrom a full priced+ game made by a billion dollar company utilizing one of the most well known IPs in the world? Yeah I would expect a sliding animation\n\nIt is a no-backtracking path before bombing a base, you do slide down it when you jump off that ledge.  Getting off the speeder probably caused the animation to not work right.  WHAT A TERRIBLE GOD AWFUL BUG, lITtEraLLY UNplaYABLE!!!!  Any who, the game is fun and reddit sucks ass.\n\nAgreed, I hate on Ubisoft as a company as much as the next person but this is literally a nothing glitch that has zero affect on how enjoyable the game is.\n\nSeriously.  How many people would even bother doing this?  You obviously aren't meant to and can't.  Every single piece of media that is released sees countless people scrambling over one another to be the first to shit on it.  To find anything even mildly noteworthy to clip and post to social media.  I don't even plan on purchasing this game, but this sure a shit isn't a reason.\n\npeople that pay $120\n\ndamn, I should have known\n\nit's \"Ubisoft\"\n\nUnless you're a streamer/YouTuber, I don't understand why you'd pay an extra $50 to play this game three days early with a few extra benefits. It's kinda a shame as it does feel like Ubisoft has potential to be a great game studio. Their games look great, the combat in their games can be quite fun at times, and their games have great little details. Unfortunately, they make their games fucking enormous. Unless you are going to spend years upon years making a game with a massive team, I don't understand why you would make it so big.\n\nNever preorder, especially for Ubi.\n\nI just paid $20 for a month of Ubisoft+ and cancelled it lol I’m not gonna play this game for more than a month anyway\n\nThat’s a sliding slope you’re only meant to be able to go down in those spaces, not up. Hence the sliding.\n\n[removed]\n\nDark Forces 2 is legitimately one of the best Star Wars games ever made. Wish someone (not Ubisoft or EA) still made games in that series.\n\nThe terrain looks so ass\n\nIt also looks like the next to lowest settings possible.\n\nprob just video compression\n\nIt's a gif\n\nI'm about 10 hours in on series x, and it's great fun. Like not being sarcastic. It runs smoothly for me, gameplays enjoyable, story is better than most star wars stuff lately.  \n\nBut this is a gaming sub and your not allowed to acknowledge that any aaa game can be fun.\n\nThis is just gaming in a nutshell nowadays and it's sad. \n\nThere are relatively small pockets of actual positivity about games or constructive feedback. Really it's mostly filled with people regurgitating the same negativity that streamers and journalists push. They can never formulate their own opinions.\n\nOr, it's from a company that may have a less than stellar track record and so everything they release is therefore terrible. \n\nGamers have gotten really unhinged and generally toxic over the last decade.\n\nI'm enjoying it, don't kill me reddit\n\nIt's a great game. I'm loving it.\n\nI haven't enjoyed all the recent ubisoft games, but this is really good.\n\n&gt;stands on steep incline\n\n&gt;slides down\n\nThe game is buggy for sure, but is this really one of them?\n\nI have serious trust issues with developers now a days. Too excited to push broken unfinished bs our way to be patched at a later date. \n\nThese bad faith practices have ruined my hype for most upcoming titles for me. \n\nCompanies like rockstar help me keep faith that companies taking their time and waiting to release a finished product isn’t dead. (Looking at you CD projekt red Cyberpunk 2077)\n\nTo be fair, release Rockstar games tend to have a lot of bugs too. I remember watching the bug videos for Red Dead 2 and how hilarious some of them were.\n\nBut, the rest of the game is so polished and impressive that you can forgive the occasional bug.\n\nI think that's a major difference, bugs are hard to avoid in open world games. But if it's only minor stuff that might give you a laugh, it's forgiveable. \n\nIf it's frequent and very noticeable, then it becomes a bigger problem.\n\nA lot of times it's the publisher trying to hit end of year quotas. The developer is at their whim if they think it's sellable at it's current state. Massive is owned by UBI. They have no say unless it's unplayable. (Sometimes even then)\n\nFast travel.\n\nthat's why you wait until it hits steam, most of the bugs will be fixed and all the dlc will be released\n\nSo many people defending it for some reason too\n\nIntentionally focusing on nitpicking corner cases like this where getting off your speeder locks your animation of a hill you normally slide down in any normal play pattern detracts from real criticism of the games industry and the subpar product they often deliver.\n\nIt's the constant Ubisoft bashing for things other games have too that gets tiring really quick. Bugs like this for Elden Ring launch get downvoted. Same with Denuvo, was surprised to see Wukong had the DRM because if it was another game it would be all over the user reviews.\n\nNot defending it, but I really appreciate the buy-on-release guinea pigs these days.\n\ni might have to be a day 1 space marine player though... just looks too much fun and I've heard it runs well even in the early build\n\n[deleted]\n\nOh they are probably having fun playing it?\n\nI think there are a lot of people calling out the stupidity of a lot of the criticism. Playability issues are fair game. Bitching that a woman is the main character is not.\n\nI'm not defending it, but I will say nothing I've seen has deterred me from wanting to buy it. You guys act like every game needs to be Elden Ring or it's not worth. Games have never not had bugs and glitches.\n\nBecause we enjoy it.\n\nSome reason. It's not hard to understand that not everybody is super duper anal or super duper serious about their videogames. I wanted to mess around in a Star Wars flavor smoothie, and I like Ubisoft games. So this is working out for me so far.\n\nI'm enjoying it\n\nBetter than Starfield.\n\nThis game brings nothing new to the game industry\n\nIs every AAA/AAAA game in 2024 just ass or something?\n\nPretty much.\n\nRushing incomplete games out has been a trend for years now.\n\nWhy spend another year polishing the game when you can cash out quickly and promise to improve the product later.\n\nMajority of the studio moves onto a new project. A poor skeleton crew is stuck trying to salvage the game for a year until they pull the plug.\n\nAs long as gamers keep buying this shit it's never going to stop.\n\nFFVII Rebirth is fairly polished, even if I got overwhelmed by all of its content\n\nI felt so robbed by that game with everyone hyping it up saying it was good. Now I feel pretty great about outlaws when everyone online saying it sucks\n\nThis game is a good time though. \n\nGo read a novel if you want serious perfectionnnnnnnuggh.\n\nOr make your own magically 10/10 game.\n\nI've probably played 40+ fun games that released this year. Because I don't have an insane gatekeeping system, play games for fun, and don't expect to play the same game for weeks on end.\n\nY'all expect way too much out of this childish hobby, woof\n\nReminds me of Skyrim how you could drive horses up mountains too steep to walk up lol\n\nI am terrified every time i call that thing and it speeds up. I feel like it is eventually gonna yeet me into outer space\n\nas soon as i saw the speeder come up i was just hoping it was the swg bug/issue with speeders. i forget if it was mounting or dismount maybe both but just rubber band around. not the exploding mount issue.\n\nSliiiiiiiide\n\nYou misspelled speedrunning tactics wrong\n\nYeah there was a time when the speedster wouldn’t even move but other than that the games been pretty fun and solid for me\n\nJust wait for the beta to be done in two months.\n\nWhat makes people try this? Like why would you run into the wall just to get off your bike? \n\nWhy even bother buying  any game launch at this point ?\n\nAt least she didn't do the T pose 😂\n\nDont downloaded illegal xD\n\nI have been playing this game since the 'early release' I am yet to encounter ANY bugs at all.  From when is this footage?\n\nIm done with this game after only 2 minutes. Reason being, it blue screened my PC everytime Im given control.\n\nThis game is boring disaster. Do not buy\n\nFuck that looks clunky\n\nGoddamn it, CJ!\n\nIt's janky for sure but I've been enjoying the world. It feels alive and so far it's been a decent story. Not the most exciting gameplay but for a month of Ubisoft+ premium I'm not complaining\n\nIt's not bugs. It's the Force.\n\nYep this is r/gaming for you, just one big circlejerk. This isn't even a noteworthy bug....\n\nIs this even a bug?  Just seems like a gating mechanic."

Well, it is just a wish.\n\nJust to put it out there. There are new Futurama seasons on Hulu.\n\nREMEMBER ME!\n\n👁👁🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥\n\nAnother reminder that anything you don't have a local copy of is subject to being removed from your access at any time. Companies are not to be trusted to archive their media and make sure becomes available to the public when they are gone. Movies, TVs, games, books, music, anything else that is published - It is up to the public to make sure things live on.\n\nI always took the physical version whenever possible but there was a ton of web only content on that site\n\nThe problem with \"physical copy\" is that a lot of those have features that brick them if *their* access to verification dies.\n\nThe answer is: You need a local copy that has no DRM, like the offline installers GOG offers.\n\nIn this case it’s a physical copy of a magazine, and I’d really like to see them brick the ability to read them on the can :&gt;\n\nRIP Game Informer best toilet content in the world\n\n&gt;this case it’s a physical copy of a magazine\n\nI thought that's what you meant, I was really confused by the previous comment\n\n\"How tf do you brick a magazine without literally using bricks\"\n\nProbably a bot\n\nJudging by their post history, it's unlikely, or else it's one heck of a multipurpose bot to write short replies and then essays about Valheim.\n\nTomorrows headline:\n\n\"Gamestop lawyer accused of bathroom acid attack.\"\n\nI still pull out a random issue from 2015 or whatever sometimes to read while I poop. I have the cover with the FFXV spread on my wall haha\n\nThere is a worldwide effort to get companies to force some sort of offline capability when servers (DRM or otherwise) are shut down. Check out [Stop Killing Games](https://www.stopkillinggames.com/) as there are petitions all over the world being signed right now, the biggest one recently launched is in the EU. If you are an EU citizen, you can sign the petition to force it to be discussed by the EU parliament.\n\nWhat are you talking about? A physical copy in this case means a magazine. Like, made out of paper. Pretty sure those don't have DRM lmao\n\nIn time, EVERY protection mechanism got cracked.\n\none word wget\n\nTake everything! I've used that to steal and rebuild a website I lost access too.\n\nAnd reddit comments that got deleted/self-vandalized during the API \"protest\", and every Discord server...\n\n*Nothing* is truly archived, company or not. Internet Archive / Wayback Machine are just a few ignorant politicians away from being legislated out of existence on a bad day.\n\nIf it's not on your own computer, it's at someone's whim.\n\n&gt; every Discord server\n\nDiscord is even worse because it can't be easily archived in any way.  I absolutely hate that so many communities have moved to Discord for everything.  Rooting through a bunch of channels and pins that link to google docs that have been taken down by the owner or to another in-discord comment that's been edited or removed.  And the worst part?  If someone hijacks a server admin's account, they can nuke everything and it's just GONE.  Discord can't (or won't) restore it.\n\nIt’s annoying. It’s why I love the good old forums much more. Even on reddit google docs that are just one year old aren’t safe.\n\nForums aren't safe, Ubisoft moved to discord for their forums and put a giant blocker on the site preventing you from accessing old posts. Have an issue and you Google it? One of the forum posts might appear, but clicking on it will just tell you they moved to discord.\n\nThe old Wizards of the Coast forums had lots of great community stuff on them, but they went a step further than that by mangling older posts multiple times through upgrades before finally putting them out of their misery. This means that even if you dig up the right link for the Wayback Machine, you still might not find a version of a thread with quoted posts intact and such.\n\nBlizzard redesigned the World of Warcraft forums around the time WoW Catacylsm launched in... 2010? Sure, the original forums looked pretty ancient, so keeping them looking nice wasn't an issue.\n\nBut instead of Blizzard just giving the forums a new coat of paint, they reset them. Started from scratch. For a while, they did keep a snapshot of the old forums accessible, but that didn't last too long. The original WoW forums, and everything posted on them from 2004-2010 (AKA when WoW was at its biggest) is gone. All those discussions about the game back then, all wiped for pretty much no reason.\n\nThere was an infamous community of regular posters on the EU off-topic boards which I was heavily involved in. Resetting the forums killed that community almost overnight. I met my best friend on those forums - he's still my best friend after all these years. But I can't go and look at our old posts because a company as big as Blizzard couldn't be bothered to archive the forums. It sucks.\n\nWhat's even more frustrating is that you know they still have all the posts. They just don't think outsiders should have access anymore. Companies don't delete data. They store everything.\n\nAs someone who grew up on discussion boards, I never understood how Discord is supposed to be used. I tried joining a group once or twice, only to leave me lost and unable to locate my post/comment after a day or so. There's simply no way am I gonna sit in front of my computer waiting for a response, much less install the app.\n\nDiscord is basically the gamer version of Slack, or a live messaging platform with sequestered topics. If a Discord server is like an IRC server, then its individual channels are like individual IRC channels, but Discord (and Slack) have server-based message archiving for historical retrieval.\n\nHowever, a ton of groups/communities have turned their community Discord server, best suited initially for live conversation and maybe some general referential material, into their whole one-stop shop for everything related to their communities. This includes forum-like reference messages/comments in a dedicated channel, live chat channels, image spam/sharing channels, bots, multiple voice channels for ad-hoc group voice stuff. Instead of developing a proper website or platform, some have turned to bootstrapping a Discord server for this use with the use of a custom Discord bot or making use of existing bots.\n\nMost personal/small-group Discord servers are effectively similar to like a WhatsApp messaging group or something like that, with some additional functionality on top. This isn't how medium/large-sized Discord servers use Discord though.\n\nI tried it before, and even when they’ve improved and added many features helping you sorting information, it’s still really hard to navigate all of it, much less on a big scale with an active server.\n\nIt’s also too basic for formatting.\n\nYou’d need someone curate all the information, I can’t imagine letting everyone posting resources freely without one. \n\nIt’s even worse if it’s a live discussion in a crowded server, no one would be reading anyone else’s chat. \n\nIn the end, I just use that place to post links from other sources.\n\nDid you never use stuff like MSN Messenger or IRC back when message boards were big? It's basically just the same thing, a chat program for more live stuff. \n\nI do wish there was forums for longer term stuff and Discord for shorter term stuff like back then but Reddit, Twitter etc killed that style off.\n\nDiscord is the absolute best group chat you can access with your friends. When I see community servers, it looks like a nightmare trying to navigate and it turns into a forum site with shitty navigation and bad layout design. Endless channels that 90% never get used and anything useful just gets buried.\n\nIt's particularly annoying for software projects. You have tons and tons of free issue trackers and yet some go to discord, where you can't (effectively) search, most things aren't in thread format, you have to install a separate client and so on and so forth. No idea why anyone would do that\n\nI've seen this for a few mods on nexus \"you can find the last version and more resources on our discord\" fuck that shit! how is that even allowed? I'm on nexus, I want the mod here\n\nLatest thing that infuriates me. For some reason people outside of Discord are linking to files uploaded to Discord. These are not available outside of Discord. If they haven't been removed entirely, you have to open the link through Discord to access the file. \n\n\n What in the actual fuck.\n\n\nI guess nobody gives a shit whether files are accessible to the wider internet or in a month.\n\nThe vast majority of people doing this have never experienced any file system besides the one on their mobile phone.\n\nReading Discord is an awful experience.\n\nYes, Discord sucks big time.\n\nNah it's a good replacement for skype.\n\nIt's just that people decided to use it for other stuff too for some reason.\n\nI think it's a case of folks not wanting to make accounts elsewhere, so rather than make a whole account per forum it's easier to convince people to join if they already have the one account, being Discord. Though it does suck it's become shoehorned into handling stuff it wasn't meant to. It's like how some folks don't want Twitter to die because of its use for disaster reporting or other stuff, and as useful as that is at the end of the day it's a micro blogging site, with no further responsibilities than that.\n\nDiscord doesn't make any sense. I hate open-source projects that improperly use Discord instead of a forum.\n\nAmen brother. Discord is the scourge of our time. Bring back websites and bulletin boards!\n\nStuff I hate: On the Internet forever and set in stone. Future empires will hook the Internet back up and see my cringe as the last surviving mote of our civilization.\n\nStuff I treasure: Has the lasting power of wet tissue paper and dreams.\n\n&gt;Stuff I hate: On the Internet forever and set in stone. Future empires will hook the Internet back up and see my cringe as the last surviving mote of our civilization\n\nYep. I have a unique first+second name combo (the only person in the world with it that has an online presence at least) yet the police typoed a criminals name to mine when giving details to the press. There are news articles directly saying that someone with my unique name committed serious crimes (burgulary/assault/resisting arrest/etc). \n\nIt used to be worse and when googling my name there were just a dozen articles about it, I have managed to get all but one removed. That last one is basically impossible to remove since the news company doesn't consider direct proof from multiple police, legal and governmental organisations to be reliable enough evidence. I wish they required 1/10th that level of proof when they published the original article...\n\n&gt; Internet Archive / Wayback Machine are just a few ignorant politicians away from being legislated out of existence on a bad day.\n\nIt's actually even worse than that. The Internet Archive is facing kind of existential threat *right now* due to litigation. The copyright lobby is just too strong.\n\nGot a link to read more about it? First time I’ve heard about this.\n\nTo be clear, this lawsuit is not about general Internet Archive/Wayback Machine. It’s specifically suing the Open Library initiative they did during COVID.\n\nSure, the case is [Hachette vs Internet Archive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hachette_v._Internet_Archive). There are (obviously biased) updates about it on the Internet Archive's blog as well.\n\nEven right now Wayback Machine isn't perfect. A few years back I found something archived and linked it in a reddit comment. Recently the same topic was being discussed so I had the bright idea of finding that comment and using the same link... except the link now led nowhere.  \nI can only assume that they were asked to take down the archive for that particular website, though I can't fathom *why*. It was just a gaming related forum, and in fact it still exists though it has gone through several redesigns - in the first redesign they had kept all their old threads in their own archive, but later redesigns removed those so the Wayback Machine was all that's left. Now even that's gone, all that remains are people's comments about it.\n\nThe Internet Archive used to follow the *current* robots.txt, so a website could block it afterwards even for old archived versions. I don't know if they changed it.\n\nThis is my argument when young'uns rag on me for downloading porn.\n\nYou know that scene you keep going back to? One day it won't be there anymore.\n\nYou'd think they'd learn after the Great Pornhub Purge a few years back.\n\nNot just that, I remember back in the day MEGA (formly known as Megaupload) had a porn subsidary called MegaPorn. There was quite a few videos I remember fondly that is now lost to the ethers.\n\nMegaupload itself went away for awhile, and it was pretty much the go-to website for sharing *anything*. Losing it was a huge blow for a long time.\n\nNot just in porn either, like for example if you had an obscure technical problem that was 'solved' by someone prior to 2012, 99% chance they shared that fix via Megaupload and you were just SOL. It was prolific enough of a problem that it was sort of a minor meme for awhile, in the same vein as \"I'm DM you the fix :)\" or \"Nevermind I fixed it\".\n\n&gt; There was quite a few videos I remember fondly that is now lost to the ethers.\n\nIf it's any consolation, that was over a decade ago, so the quality of the videos was likely 480p at best.\n\nSome actors/actresses look better in 480p\n\nI remember seeing my first HD porn in 2010. My response was pretty much the \"we have to go back\" meme from Lost.\n\nI mean I still watch vintage porn uploads that are terrible quality. As long as it's hot and not too grainy I don't care.\n\nLol fair point... But how many p's were those Heather Brooke (Harmon) videos, you reckon?\n\nThat was a great loss for humanity\n\nI remember that purge. I felt a great disturbance in the Force, as if millions of bookmarked links suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced.\n\nxtube straight up shut down.\n\nYuuup. Kids get used to not being able to have anything downloaded because they don't want parents to find it. Took me a good decade+ of living independently before that trauma left me (I had 8 years of conservative christian dormitory deans raiding computers as well).\n\nBut boy, when Tumblr went down and then NewTumbl followed after, that REALLY broke the wall for me. I'm done blog-style porning. I lost so, so much work to those two. Everything is getting downloaded, tagged, and archived now. Feels super shit to give up on the idea of porn communities, but I just can't deal with more mass-wipes. It's not worth it.\n\n&gt;You know that scene you keep going back to? One day it won't be there anymore.\n\nThat 'one day' is usually less than a week later. Nothing's lasted on the tube sites for any significant amount of time for years now.\n\nThe are two old ones from over a decade ago I could never find again and refuse to dedicate any significant time scouring for obvious reasons. Wax on wax off I guess \n\nI've forgotten more porn that I busted to than most people have seen, but there's one or two I've been looking for forever I have no good way of looking for. It's impressive. r/tipofmypenis want even any help.\n\nWhich is why I have 20TB of storage and host my own shit lol. \n\nReminder, you can take action at least for video game preservation \n\nhttps://www.stopkillinggames.com/countries\n\nA major thing source that people are currently barely archiving at all is Youtube. It has become such a major source of media consumption, with many high quality videos made every single day. Yet if Youtube shuts down tomorrow or has to do a huge purge due to some legal issues, a large chunk of that content will be lost forever. I've heard plenty of Youtubers themselves say that they don't really keep back-ups of their own videos because the file sizes get too large or they had back-ups but ended up losing the hard drive it was on.\n\nWe are already there. Depending how long you have used Youtube, a huge amount of the oldest videos in your playlists are gone. Even videos from a year or two ago. Copyright strikes, account deletions/terminations, video deletions, videos breaking terms and conditions... I don't think Youtube even displays the deleted videos in those playlists anymore, so you basically don't even know that some videos are gone that you thought were important to you at some point in your life.\n\nEdit: You can click the three dots in a playlist to reveal the deleted videos. Try to google the video ID if it produces any results. \n\nI started using Youtube in 2008, and a few years ago archived *everything* still left in those playlists.\n\nIt is funny a bit because these companies consist of public and literally cannot function without public yet some how this public is not responsible for preserving media and instead it is a responsibility of that other public you’re talking about. \n\nTo preserve art and media we need laws and museums/fonds. At least it works like that with classic art\n\nThe perishability of stuff on the internet really caught us all off guard.  Electronic data was supposed to be increasingly and almost completely trivial to preserve in comparison with the media it replaced.\n\nTheoretically immortal, but requires effort to maintain accessibility. \n\nAnd destroyed as easier as it is copied.\n\nSure, but it is a proportionally miniscule amount of effort to preserve something online. For static content in particular, it's trivially easy to do so. That's why there are still web pages out there that have sat untouched for 30 years and are still easily accessible.\n\nFor a company like GameStop, the cost to leave those articles online in an archived state would have been small enough to be considered a rounding error on the balance sheet. And if that was still too much, they could have easily crowdsourced it by freely letting independent data preservationists download the archive and host it themselves.\n\nThe reality is that it wasn't taken down because it's hard to maintain, it was taken down because capitalism dictates that it's better to destroy something than give it away for free.\n\nLast sentence is true, I used to work at a deli that would scan out unsold wraps and sandwiches everyday. I’d probably throw away 15-25 a night, straight into the trash. Probably would have fed every homeless person in town.\n\nThat's so horrible. I wish there were some laws against throwing left over food\n\nThere are laws that protect food donators, that's about it.\n\nToo good to go is an app/service that has helped tackle that issue\n\nData rot is a thing too\n\nYep. In the same way that archivists need to properly store physical items like film, tapes, vinyl records, and books, many people don't realise that data storage mediums also need to be taken care of.\n\n\nAs far as I know, all current data storage mediums are prone to various level of decay and failure. The up shot is that when compared to analogue mediums, digital mediums can have exact replicas made. So long as we keep making new storage mediums, we can keep maintaining copies.\n\n\nOf course, we need archivists to do this, the new mediums aren't free, and if they are active, they have running costs too. Information preservation is not cheap!\n\n\nI hope there's ya break through with larger digital soteage mediums soon. We seem be very close to hitting the ceiling for spinning disc drives... \n\n&gt; , digital mediums can have exact replicas made. \n\nThere's still rot of format depreciation, and then loss of data when copying format to format. Word '97 is a translation of that doc when opening it in 365.  So unless you have an old copy of Word '97 and a VM with Windows '95 on it, there's possibility for loss.\n\nIt'll only get worse as OSs do the \"can no longer be installed/ activated\" thing because of the online requirements.\n\nIt's a bit ironic as well. There's the saying of \"be careful of what you post on the internet because whatever you post will be on there forever\" and it's for sure a good warning still when it comes to protecting yourself from potential future problems. \n\nHowever if there's one thing I've learned the past few years it's that stuff absolutely does disappear either permanently, or becomes obscured to the point of being impossible to find back.\n\nFading into the depths of obscurity is a *massive* issue in my opinion.\n\nIt's gotten to the point where *searchability* has fallen out of favor. Like, not engine searching, but crawling sites for specific content yourself. That wouldn't be TOO awful if not for the fact that it's often difficult to find something you don't remember well even WITH search engines, and that's ignoring how algorithm-driven those have gotten.\n\nCan we just appreciate the people that archive this shit\n\nI've been keenly aware since ESPN got rid of the comment section on their articles. Which actually made sense to do, it was the same shit as twitter now. But at the same time they did a big site update and nuked almost a decade of content. \n\nEven with the internet a shocking amount of sports history can really only be heard through oral history or going to the campus libraries and looking up newspaper articles. And I'm talking early 21st century news, shit about conference realignment and network tv contracts. You just can't find anything about it anywhere. It quite easy for information to fall into the ether these days. Just takes some rando VP asking why a server is costing a company money and poof.\n\nAh, crunchyroll also just got rid of their comment section too. It was the only rwason I watched anything on their website. Being able to hear the thoughts of other watchers was really nice. Well, among all the shitty comments.\n\n20 years ago when people bought books, CDs, and DVDs, upon their deaths their children, family, or friends could inherit them.\n\nWith books, music and movies online now, that just all disappears.\n\nEdit: Same with video games too\n\nDespite popular belief, human methods of data preservation have steadily become less and less permanent. \n\nWe have cave paintings from the very first humans that are still perfectly preserved. Stone tablets can last thousands of years, paper several hundred. Film reels and cassette tapes deteriorate after a few decades and electronic data is becoming increasingly more fleeting.\n\nThere's a survivorship bias there. The vast majority of cave art / old paintings / what have you are gone and we're here marveling at the ones that survived thinking they're superior in their preservability. Plenty of random digital data will survive far into the future too, it just won't be anywhere near comprehensive, just as the early art you refer to is not.\n\nArguably an even bigger issue is maintaining the technology needed to access newer types of data storage.\n\nIf you gave someone in the 70s a cassette tape, they'd likely have at least one cassette player to play it in. Nowadays? Very few people would be able to play it themselves, but you'd at least be able to find someone who can. Fifty years from now? Good luck finding anyone with a working cassette player - as soon as something becomes obsolete technology, not only do regular people abandon it, but so do manufacturers of the equipment and parts. By the end of this century, we'll reach a point where the majority of functioning cassette players exist only in museums.\n\nIt's already happened to many older formats. Wax cylinders, for example. But with more modern formats, it'll be an even bigger issue. Something like a wax cylinder player is a pretty simple piece of technology that a skilled amateur can feasibly try to get working.\n\nBut what about CDs? When they finally reach the point of being completely obsolete, our collective ability to use them will rapidly diminish. The electronics within CD players are very complex, let alone the fact that the lasers used to read the CDs are very fragile and need to be precisely calibrated. Maintaining such complex equipment is something that's only suitable for a professional, but that knowledge will eventually become a lost art.\n\nThere are already some data storage formats that are difficult to access due to the lack of working equipment to read them, and as our technology increases in complexity, that's going to happen to far more of the formats we use.\n\nThis is all something that I unfortunately have a fair bit of experience with. I collect music on all kinds of formats, and one of my favourites is MiniDisc. It was a mainstream format over here in the UK, but even though it's only been around 25 years since the peak of its popularity, there are only a handful of people left in the entire world who specialise in servicing and repairing MiniDisc players. Once they're gone, that's it. The technology is far too specialised for anyone but a specialist to maintain. I've been transferring the contents of my discs onto my PC to keep them accessible, but even hard drives will become obsolete eventually.\n\nUnless we collectively put a lot more focus on keeping older data formats accessible and making sure they're archived, we as a species are going to lose access to a lot of our own history. And sadly, I just don't think enough people realise or care how big of an issue it's going to become.\n\nInteresting perspective. It is a form of art however. Maybe they need to be compared to other things like Mount Rushmore.\n\nMaybe they had perishable forms of information: we don't know since it's gone.\n\nThey did, it was oral history for thousands of years, hence why information is so sparse.\n\nFor years it was kind of ignored until science started seeing things in oral history like the most recent Cascadia event that caused the great wave in Japan. \n\nNative Americans had stories of a great flood on the Pacific coast that were ignored and only in the last 100 years was it realized, based on cross referencing other written histories such as Japan that it was actually the last time Cascadia had a major event and it wiped out entire tribes in Western NA.\n\n[removed]\n\n[removed]\n\n[removed]\n\n[removed]\n\n[removed]\n\n[removed]\n\n[removed]\n\n[removed]\n\n[removed]\n\n[removed]\n\n[removed]\n\n[removed]\n\n[removed]\n\n[removed]\n\n[removed]\n\n[removed]\n\n[removed]\n\nThis is incredibly demoralizing to anyone who wrote for Game Informer. The pay is generally crap (as a freelancer) but you do it to get your stuff out there and start building a portfolio. To have that work essentially buried sucks.\n\nLots of employees found out they had lost their jobs via social media\n\nfeels like it's the tenth time ive read this this year\n\nAnd from what I've heard, it was AI generated. I sure looks like it. Which makes sense if you fire all your writers. Just disgusting if you ask me.\n\nI mean now people could add \"wrote for Game informer\" on their CV and it's almost impossible to verify. Sort of like when people pretended to work for Twitter when all the layoffs happened after Elon took over\n\nThat doesn't help the people whose work is now gone.\n\nYeah, if the work can't be verified then it most likely will just be treated as if it never happened. This isn't actually a good thing for either the actual writers or fakers.\n\n20+ years freelance writer here. This is in fact the sad norm. Most of my work is on Internet Archive. I've gained and lost fame more times than I can count.\n\nLook how they’ve massacred my boy\n\ngrowing up, i was made to believe that \"what gets on the internet, stays on the internet forever.\" as if it was this huge unmovable, unchanging thing.\n\nthen i tried looking for my first ever website on geocities, and i can't find it, it wasnt important enough to be archived.. my website is gone forever.\n\nIt’s just the stuff you DON’T want staying on the internet, that stays forever. Stuff you want rarely stays over many years. This is why I have downloaded multiple terabytes of uhhh linux ISOs.\n\n\"Linux ISOs\"\n\nBased\n\n🤨🤨🤨\n\n😢 RIP Geocities\n\nThey killed ThinkGeek too\n\nHow I miss their April Fools products each year… :’)\n\n[removed]\n\nr/MinnMax is doing what they can.\n\nThere’s r/datahoarder\n\nr/DataHoarder\n\nr/datahoarder is the active one\n\nhttps://www.gamingalexandria.com/\n\nThis site archives old magazines, looks like they have their work cut out for them on this one.\n\nhttps://www.retromags.com/files/category/486-game-informer/\n\n\nAll issues from 1991-2014\n\nIf I remember correctly there is, but it gets almost no traffic.\n\nI had every issue from the first one till 2020, lost them in a fire. :(\n\nI feel you, I had a collection of probably 5-10 years that I lost in a flood  too =(\n\nThis is why a digital/streaming only future is not really that great. A great video on YouTube? Deleted due to copyright. Your favorite smut artworks/photograph on DevArt? Deleted because of reasons. Streaming site did not renew their rights to show your series? Well, have fun.\n\nBest way is to save the most important media on a HDD. \n\nThis is exactly why I reverted back to buying physical copies of my favourite media. Pissed me off to no end not being able to find something online, or for it to just be yeeted from a service.\n\nI’m grateful to see this on Reddit. It’s reassuring to know the wider internet is as livid as every writer who contributed to the site over the last multiple decades.\n\nThank you all!\n\nDude, a flood of memories came back seeing your name here. I checked the site for new articles by you and the rest of the crew almost every day in my early teens. Thanks for everything!\n\nBest wishes to you and every one over there Kyle (you might remember me as \"The Movie Planet\" over on YouTube)\n\nGameinformer was, no joke, the first website I checked every morning when I got online. You guys were a massive part of my childhood and adulthood, and taught me what good games journalism could look like. I'm sorry they did this to y'all, you deserved so much better.\n\nYou were part of a great time in my childhood man\n\nThank you.\n\nThat was quick\n\nDid anyone archive them\n\nGameStop didn't exactly give much warning\n\n\"Bet y'all wish you bought a physical copy now\"\n\nI did. Have/had months left on my subscription\n\nTime to check your contracts - if they aren't making any more, they shouldn't be able to take your money and run.\n\nYou have to email them to cancel the subscription and get a refund\n\n::looks at box of moldy magazines::\n\nI still have at least 100 issues of sports illustrated for kids sitting in a box from when I was a kid. I'm almost 30 and can't fathom ever throwing that junk away\n\nUntil you realize that you almost never or never use them, and it’s just more clutter that you’ll eventually get rid of. \n\nWow that's a chunk of my childhood gone. \n\nAnd that is why the way back machine and internet archive must remain free and accessible to all.\n\nSo, my once worthless stack of Game Informer magazines is now priceless stack of Game Informer magazines??🤞🏻\n\nThey really want to be forgotten\n\nI saved every game informer magazine I ever got\n\nLike 100+ magazines packed away in boxes\n\nTheir not mint condition or anything, since I read every single article multiple times as a kid/teen\n\nAnyway looks like I’ll be scanning them for the internet archive soon\n\nNot very Super Stonk of GameStop.\n\nI think the CEO is crazy a touch.\n\nHes been going off the rails lately\n\nThis comment has been overwritten.\n\nFunny thing is GameStop just tweeted being critical of Microsoft shutting down the 360 store and making those games inaccessible.\n\nThen they just do it themselves.\n\nThey've always been a POS company.\n\nPeople are nostalgia mad but they weren’t ever reading that stuff be real\n\nRunning servers cost money so no shock this happened\n\n[removed]\n\nI bought them all the time too. \n\nBut at some point it the quality went way downhill \n\nWho gave this bot all these upvotes. There’s no way this account is real\n\nWhy do you say this is a bot?\n\n6000 comment karma in 4 days, *and* a profile picture of a woman showing off cleavage? Not to mention, most of its comments are deleted. Someone was farming karma and dusted their tracks.\n\nGood observation to them, This is a bot because of the username profile picture and sign up date. Like some dating scam acct\n\nI usually comment on these articles for english practice and it was sad to see how gameinformer had no traction whatsoever on this regard, 90% of their articles had no comments at all. Meanwhile IGN publishes inflammatory articles focused on \"culture wars\" and that generates thousands of comments. Sometimes the internet can be a hellhole regardless if you try to avoid Twitter and other similar platforms\n\nI'm so furious why they had to delete all the existing ones wtfff\n\nHow can I be mad at them when I threw away my game informer magazines 18 years ago. \n\nThe same thing happened with MTV's MTV News archive and everything on Comedy Central. So much online content gone because someone wanted to save a few bucks on hosting.\n\nEchoes of our past, preserved only in third-party time capsules. A stark reminder of digital ephemerality.\n\nCEO has been posting pro-Trump shit. Troll or not, it turns me the fuck off from wanting to be anywhere near this co.\n\nNow this? I see they are racing back to mediocre decisions to match their mediocre retail experience. Fuck GameStop.\n\nThat one community also treats him like the messiah (even though he keeps fucking them over by dropping more shares on them). The cult-like similarities to Trump are there.\n\nDon't forget the transphobia!\n\nAs much as I enjoyed the magazine over the years, the site has always ran like ass.  Maybe it'll be easier to load up now through these third parties.\n\nThankfully I've got my old tub full of em lol.\n\nWeird, my email link with the latest issue works just fine... well dang, it ONLY works for the latest issue, the rest error out like above\n\nThat's right, assholes, keep giving us valid reasons for preserving physical media.\n\nThe ChatGPT generated \"goodbye\" statement is like shooting me in the head after you've ripped my heart out.\n\nFuck gamestop. They've always been such a predatory company."

    "all_comment_text": "The hilarious irony about forced stealth is that one genre you’ll almost never see it in… is *stealth games*, because getting caught is part of the experience, and if you fuck up, you can always adapt and try to salvage the situation by fleeing and hiding.\n\nThe stealth genre was the first to recognize that forced stealth fucking sucks. You didn’t get a game over if Snake or Fisher or 47 get made; you just got screwed but you still had the chance to not stay screwed.\n\nFuckin A. Should X be best done by stealth? Absolutely.  But when I fuck up I want to face overwhelming odds where I have barely a chance in hell to survive, but I still want that chance,  dammit\n\nGame Over should only appear once you've actually failed. Imagine an FPS where you got a \"Game Over\" at 5% health instead of dying the next time you were shot. Or a driving sim where you have to restart if you put two wheels off the track. Or even a chess game that stopped with a \"checkmate in 5 moves\" message instead of letting it play out.\n\nThey'd all be irritating and deeply unsatisfying. I don't know why anyone thinks stealth games should be any different.\n\nThe only ones I personally accept are if it’s story connected. Like assassins trying to kill a high profile target that will escape if alarms are triggered for example. But even Hitman (at least the newer) don’t insta game over but the target tries to escape actually from the map and can still be killed. \n\nBut if for example Sam Fisher is breaking into the FBI, it makes sense that it fails if he kills somebody, gets caught on camera and so on\n\nHitman even allows you to set traps so getting caught is a plan that forces the target to try and escape down the path you've trapped.\n\nI liked the splinter cell approach where the first time they noticed you, or your work, the guards would be more alert. Pair up etc.\n\nThe second time they noticed, they'd hunker down, stop patrolling and set up like fortified positions to watch for you.\n\nThe third time they'd sound the full alarm and it was just a shitshow of guards spawning in and alarms going off. Doors locking etc\n\nGod I miss splinter cell. The spys vs mercs mode in chaos theory was so good. \n\nAnd then they trashed it with the next gen console title version, I can't remember the title. The spies couldn't touch the mercs at all and the map design emphasized these weird tunnelesque airduct routes instead of natural feeling pathways\n\nBut in chaos theory, spies could be dangerous to mercs. They could knock you out, kill you. It made it so playing as a merc was like being afraid of the dark. you'd be tossing flares ahead of you. Walking in 360 circles. \n\nAnd as a spy it was just as terrifying. One errant move. One wrongly timed action and you went from hunter to prey.\n\nI'm pretty sure there ste still some chaos theory spies vs mercs communities on PC\n\nBut incredibly small, you also need some fan patches. But the Spy vs Merc Mode of SC:CT is stand-alone, all you need is the folder with the game files. The later games have no community because Ubisoft shut it down and the game was anyway .. meh. It was an interesting go-to with a group of friends but was never overly fun with randoms because how hard nearly every equipment was level locked and the fun modes were anyway with pre-set loadouts and way darker maps (inspired by the original Spy vs Merc)\n\n  \nI still miss the glory days of 2005-2008, when I was playing chaos theory SvM nearly on a daily base, all the glitches, the absurd fun community maps. \"Hard Jump 5.1\" will always be remembered.\n\n&gt;And then they trashed it with the next gen console title version, I can't remember the title. The spies couldn't touch the mercs at all and the map design emphasized these weird tunnelesque airduct routes instead of natural feeling pathways\n\nSC: Conviction. Definitely emphasized constant movement and being able to “shadow” the enemies movements to stay out of their path. Was really fun once you got good at it. Merc was definitely at advantage with how easy it was to sweep rooms/clear hiding spots (tunnels)\n\nI played both  games for a while, just sucked that they removed it from the next game entirely\n\nEven GTA had this implemented.\n\nI have to chuckle at “*even* GTA got this right”, as if GTA were some Indy game that sucked, and not arguably the best game of its generation made by one of the largest and arguably strongest studios.\n\nGTA had a lot of half-baked mechanics, to be fair. Particularly in random story missions.\n\nYou're absolutely right.\n\nAlso, I think movement on foot sucks in GTA V and isn't much better in RDR2, that's one of the few big complaints I have about those two games. It feels incredibly imprecise, and trying to navigate ledges and the like is needlessly difficult.\n\nThey're great games overall, but by no means without flaws.\n\nIt's been a bit since I've played a Rockstar game, but your description is a very vivid reminder of the movement mechanics.\n\nRushing to a choke point exit level to take down a heavily guarded VIP who's clocked that he's being targeted in Hitman WoA is both incredibly fraught gameplay and a completely believable response narratively.\n\nOr you can bungle on purpose so a target goes to the lockdown room so you can easily locate 'em!\n\nThe latest Splinter Cell actually had that, in Blacklist you are trying to capture an arms dealer. You trigger the alarm and then break through the roof of the safe room, sadly completly story driven / not free choosable but still funny.\n\nAnd in one level of Hitman there is an actual safe room in which the target then would go into hiding and you could theoretically wait. But I always found it more entertaining to gas them in the bathroom by manipulating the AC or wait till bed time and then suprise them in the bedroom\n\n&gt;Or even a chess game that stopped with a \"checkmate in 5 moves\" message instead of letting it play out\n\nThis would be cool tho. Like you're playing against a bot and then it says \"checkmate in 4\" and then the board switches around and now you have to find the checkmate in 4.\n\nLiterally every encounter in Cyberpunk 2077\n\nPlayed it since launch despite some of the issues. LOVE this game, especially after PL and 2.0\n\nHonestly, one of the best I’ve ever played\n\nYa know, especially as far as FPS' I fully agree. But it's also probably in there of my top 15 of all games\n\nI was just playing yesterday and was doing a gig for Regina where she told me to do it however I like then bitched at me for going loud lol\n\nIt's established throughout that game, in the gigs especially, that professionals do everything as subtly as possible. Amateurs, who aren't allowed into Afterlife, are the only ones who go in guns a-blazing every time.\n\n\nRegina's implicit expectation is that V will do every job through stealth, because she sees V as a professional. So anything else *is* a disappointment, even if the mission succeeds.\n\nLiterally dishonours whole premise. Don’t get caught. But if you do, hide the bodies.\n\nThe issue with stealth in modern days is that you hide to protect the enemies from you, not the other way around. Dishonoured is a good example of that.\n\nI feel like most modern stealth games acknowledge this and try to incorporate thematic friction rather than “dead instantly if caught” friction. \n\nFor Dishonored, it’s explicit with the idea that returning the “rightful” ruler to the throne via a mountain of bodies will more or less doom the nation to endless in fighting. The DLCs are a bit more nuanced in some ways, but basically ask if it’s possible to absolve oneself from prior acts of violence with the really simple answer being “not if you continue to be a mass murderer.”\n\nDeath Stranding probably is even more in your face thematically *and* adds chore you have to do if you start killing everyone. \n\nHonest question, what modern stealth games come to mind where the player isn’t disincentivized in one way or another from killing?\n\nWhat he means isn't a thematic reason not to kill, or even a \"game over if spotted\" scenario, but rather that modern day stealth games you are more often than not insanely OP in a fight. Yes, Dishonored discourages you from killing by threatening a bad ending if you do. But the point is you *can* carve a path through the city with your massive bag of murder powers. Like he said, you aren't hiding to protect yourself from the world. You're hiding to protect the world from you.\n\nSome games gets this right, like Thief, where if you decide to stay and fight instead of running and hiding, you are in great danger and could die quite easily, with the risk of death going up exponentially with every single opponent added to the fight.\n\nFight 3 guards in Dishonored? Easily take them down without a worry. Fight 3 guards in Thief? Long drawn out fight with a high risk of death but possible to win with enough skill and expertise. That's the difference\n\nDishonored has in-game reasons not to kill, the chaos system increases enemies as you kill and by killing you're aiding in the spread of the plague. You can be lethal but it negatively effects the world around you in ways that effect the story.\n\nSo by hiding you protect the world from you, not yourself from dangerous enemies. Don't get me wrong, I am glad the game has a diegetic reason for it, but it still the same phenomenon I have described.\n\nYes! This is my issue with MGS games, generally you can quite blaze through easier and faster without going stealth. It's just roleplay to feel cool using stealth. \n\nGetting caught needs to have actual consequences.\n\nThe consequences are a shitty rating for completion. You don't get S rank for guns blazing.\n\nIt’s not like it’s going to affect my future job prospects\n\nMGS is a bad example for that then, because Snake is literally sent into suicidal situations as a solo operative and not even given a gun to start off with.\n\nLike either he dies, aborts mission (court martialed) or succeeds and basically saves the world.\n\nAlso, at least in MGS1 and MGS2 it's not like there are a lot of civilians hanging around. So even if it came out that this one person murdered everyone on the operation site it's just \"Lone soldier solos entire enemy base to disarm giant, mobile, nuke launching mech saving the world!\"\n\nYou could apply this to literally any conversation about any game and end it there lmfao\n\nOn that note, I absolutely love how in 'Mark of the Ninja' AKA best stealth game ever, once a guard spots you, he doesn't forget. Guards get scared and they remain vigilant if they spot you, instead of what most of the games do, where a guard catches you, you hide and they completely forget about you a few seconds after.\n\nEdit: and by scared I mean SCARED. Some guards will start shooting at birds, shadows, anything that moves or makes a sound, even other guards.\n\nAuthentic difficulty for Sniper Elite 4 and iirc Sniper Elite 5 is sort of like what you mentioned. If you get caught or \"go loud\" and later re-enter stealth they'll be on guard (faster detection iirc) and patrol instead of standing in their \"designated spot\"\n\nI've tried to get into the Sniper Elite games so many times but they always feel just that little bit too janky for me to enjoy! I love sniping a Nazis balls right off but actually playing the game? Maybe I need to try the newest one again.\n\nIn my experience its more enjoyable to do 4-&gt;5-&gt;3. Also the coop is nice.\n\nI completed entire levels making them terrified enough to massacre each other by accident, then cutting down the last one when he was standing there wondering why everyone else was down from bullets.\n\ni tried maxing out my scores by distracting the guards, making them terrified and then going for the kill. All while not being detected\n\nTook hours for one level to do it perfect, only to find out cheaters took over the scoreboard.\n\nThis is why i never bother with scoreboards in games, especially singleplayer games. I'll challenge myself to so a level perfect for ny own enjoyment, but I'll ignore the boards.\n\nOf course, sometimes they surprise me. Like I played Neon White and scoffed when I saw a scoreboard level done in 1 second. A quick google later and I was a very humbled man\n\n\"Must've been the wind\"\n\nWell in fairness, he's got an arrow lodged in his brain now, he probably isn't doing so good with the thinking.\n\nHa. I was literally just typing the same comment...\n\nBlew my mind as a kid that in Arkham Asylum the enemies heart rates would increase after they discover a body or Joker tells them someone’s gone missing. It would affect how they searched for you and interact with each other, like if there was two enemies left sometimes one would abandon the other to fend for themselves.\n\nJust made me dream of playing another chaos theory level Splinter Cell game. \nThe newer ones were alright but something about ghosting using gadgets and not relying on the mark&amp;execute system was super satisfying\n\nThe mark and execute system robbed all the sequels of any sort of danger.  Chaos Theory still reigns as my favorite stealth game by far and I don't think anything has yet to surpass it.\n\n\nEspecially the co-op. That was really something else. \n\nPretty sure there were forced stealth sections in Splinter Cell.\n\nBut the big difference is, that the stealth is actually good in those games.\n\nUbisoft being the stupid asses they are will use the fact they had to remove forced stealth as a “no one wants stealth” excuse to not make a new splinter cell.\n\nSniper Elite is the new Splinter Cell\n\n*laughs in European Extreme*\n\nI knew it was a good idea to wait until the deluxe ultra mega god edition is on sale some time next year.\n\nThis is basically true of every single player game, tho.  And multiplayer it only matters to get in on the ground floor because you can't know there will be a community for playing it in the future.\n\nUbisoft more than most encourage this though because they always discount their games heavily faster than others.\n\nMost other companies you might see a 15% sale during the first year, 25% if it is the holidays and the game wasn't a fall release.\n\nUbisoft regularly will put their new titles to 50% within the first year, generally when they start dropping dlc so all the more reason to wait.\n\nUbisoft games shouldn't even be looked at until 2-3 years after release. It's a lot easier to forgive the blandness when it's $15 for the ultra complete jackoff edition with all the dlc released.\n\nWatch_dogs\n\n“ultra complete jackoff edition” has me cackling ☠️\n\nAlso known as \"full release\"\n\nYup! I have only broken this mantra for Elden Ring and BG3 in recent times. I'll probably be breaking it for the next Larian/Miyazaki game, as well, lol.\n\nIt was so worth it playing early access for BG3. Zero regrets. I even put a stake through astarion, which i could never do again.\n\nWait what? I didn't have early access and I staked Astarion as Gale\n\nYou can still stake Astarion, I presume he meant like he can't bring himself to do it.\n\nMaaan I really wanna play Metaphor ReFantazio but I don't wanna miss out on the inevitable MRF: Vengance with the Dr Maruki *real* ending that won't come out for a year+.  Not sure I can hold out that long.\n\nI’ll wait for a mega sale. I think this game is worth $20\n\nThat's exactly the price I set on dekudeals to notify me. Once it hits 20 or below I'll grab it. And hopefully by then all these updates will be out.\n\nI see. A r/patientgamers in the making.\n\nFree on epic type shit\n\nIt’s a Ubisoft game, so yep, every time.\n\nSo anyways...\n\n\"So these stormtroopers, I don't know if they wanted credits or they wanted something more sexual\"\n\n“Anyway, you rebels all think I’m a hero, and I’ll accept that responsibility”\n\n[removed]\n\nNow we just need a mod to replace her with Danny Devito\n\nI wish everyone in the world got replaced with Danny DeVito, including myself\n\n**Dawn of the DeVito**\n\n*Dawn of the Planet of the Devitos*\n\nOnly if we got dofferent versions at random.\n\nMatildas' father, Arnies' brother, Dennis and Dees' father to name a few.\n\nNo, you get danny devito playing you\n\nPlease, stop.. I can only get so erect\n\nDanny DeVito is also playing your erection.\n\nHe's too tall.\n\nThe Penguin needs to be on this rotation\n\nI've got an uncle who acts like frank but no one else in the family is familiar with Always Sunny and it's one of the most frustrating things in my life right now\n\nI'd love aany movie with just Danny Devito or Nic Cage playing all the roles. \n\n\nEven better, it's just Nuc Cage and Danny Devito playing all the roles, and they even switch parts. \n\n\nIt sounds crazy but it would be a fascinating study of performance and character development and even wardrobe and cinematic design to have the audience follow.\n\nThis should just be a standard mod for every game.\n\nI started blasting!\n\nShady Nasty's?\n\nNo, it’s Sha’Dynasty!\n\nIt's Sha'dynasty's, asshole!\n\nThing is, I don't see so good....\n\nI beat the game last night and man this should have been so much better. The forced stealth drove me crazy, especially because the stealth is so bad. What a wasted opportunity.\n\nForced stealth missions in any game piss me off.  The punishment for failing stealth should be a difficult, but beatable fight. An automatic fail and reset is the worst.\n\n[deleted]\n\nNPC: *We've gotta be careful here*\n\nMe: *These people just don't understand that I'm more machine than man. Everyone in this room will be dead before they can even fire a second shot.*\n\nCyberpunk is great\n\nYep, you can also be ultra violent stealthy where you massacre people so quickly they don't alert anyone.\n\nCyberpunk 2077 combat is perfection.\n\nIt definitely has its own flavor of jank, but the variety is amazing and, regardless of your desired approach, you end up feeling like a god. I felt just as cool with my tech weapon cyberpsycho as I did with my pure netrunner hack murderer. \n\nThe power fantasy fulfillment is almost unmatched by any other game.\n\nIdk if they changed it since I played. But the coolest I've felt was stop at the building looked at the outside security camera, then everyone inside is dead or dying.\n\nThey did nerf that quite a bit.\n\nTo be clear, you CAN still do it. You just can't sit in a spot where no one will ever find you and hack everyone to death in complete silence.\n\nOh, but you can, and it's not even difficult. System collapse is overpowered, because instant knockout and untraceable. Or memory leak, makes any following quickhack untraceable.\n\nWith Ping you can hack through walls, if a camera isn't readily available.\n\nThere's something amusingly satisfying from completing one of those 'you should go in stealthy, because it's too dangerous' missions, getting the optional stealth success goal, and walking away with nothing left alive. Because no one got a chance to cry out.\n\n&gt;These people just don't understand that I'm more machine than man. Everyone in this room will be dead before they can even fire a second shot.\n\n\"No, what you have are bullets, and the hope that when you run out I won't still be standing. Because if I am, you'll all be dead before you've reloaded.\n\nNPC: Be careful and quiet. We can't leave witnesses to sound the alarm!\n\nMe: No one will sound the alarm if there's no one left to sound the alarm.\n\nTakemura's flabbergasted reaction is so worth going guns blazing into the arasaka factory.\n\n\"The most important thing in war is the element of surprise? And what could be more surprising than a single gunslinger kicking down Arasaka's front door and start firing? *I* wouldn't expect that to work, so neither will they!\"\n\n(I like to think of V as increasingly erratic as the game progresses)\n\nI hate forced stealth games, but when given the option and good mechanics, I love playing steathily. 2077 was perfect for this because I just used cameras to system shock? (the non lethal one) everyones implants while I sat at the building across the street.\n\n[deleted]\n\nSniper is a good option. Just as running in there hyped up on drugs and armblades is a good option. Man I need to buy that game for console already so I can play it again.\n\nSame goes for lethal/non lethal. The cop would get so passive aggressive about it when you have the audacity to kill the highly powerful cyber psychos who are trying to kill you. \n\n“Hey V. Thanks for the info, sure is a FUCKING SHAME that SOMEBODY couldn’t control their anger today. At least that’s one less mouth to feed in the prisons ok byeeeee luv u 😙”\n\ntbf, the whole point of that mission line, I assume you're talking about Psycho Killer, is that Regina wants to try to rehab the cyberpsychos that the rest of the force (and Night City as a whole) has written off. iirc you get a bit of backstory on all of them and it's pretty obvious that almost all of them were just regular people that got sucked into the meat grinder that is Night City, and they only went cyberpsycho because society had failed them and allowed them to slip into the gears and get crushed. It kinda makes sense that she's annoyed, in her mind you're demonstrating the type of attitude that created them in the first place.\n\nYeah, cause *not* killing them is the whole point of those missions.\n\nThere's a case for it in Assassin's Creed games where you *desynchronize* from the memory when you deviate too much from the ancestor's lived experience.\n\nAC (at least some of them) actually had decent stealth mechanics and level design for it. A good stealth assassination was satisfying.\n\nMy idea of a good time was knocking off a fort a couple of levels too high in Odyssea. Sneaky sneaky, stabby stabby. Fun times.\n\nYou are one of those masochist players, finish the game out of spite, lol I moved away from that, thankfully\n\nNot at all lol. I paid for the game and wanted to beat it. I enjoyed parts of it (speeder, space combat) and I wanted to see how the story ended. It’s not the worst game ever made, not even close, just a disappointment considering the Star Wars license. But I’m glad I finished it.\n\nYeah I paid for the UbiPass just to play it so I finished it too. It's a great game overall. Loved the way the speeder felt to ride that pretty much got me hooked.\n\nI really liked the sabac game too but after a couple tourneys I sort of stopped caring about it.\n\nI said screw it, I'm enjoying it, too bad nobody else is.\n\nStar Wars might just be thee most mishandled franchise in history under Disney.\n\nMost mishandled franchise is definitely DC under Warner Brothers. But yes, under Disney it's Star Wars. Which is saying something because the MCU has been drifting aimlessly, but great individual projects keep it afloat.\n\nIn terms of potential and sheer size, i feel like star wars is the bigger waste. At least DC is doing cool animated stuff and some good games, although they fucked rocksteady\n\nAt this point it’s got to be\n\nIt's not even a bad game though. I know Ubisoft bad and every AAA game ever bad according to Reddit but the game really had a lot of good moments, fun characters, and a nice simple heist story that finally gives us something away from the struggle between Jedi and Sith. \n\nIt's not the best game ever but it's certainly not \"only a masochist would play this.\" Easily a 7/10 for me.\n\nPersonally been waiting for a good non-jedi star wars. There's so much more to the setting than hokey religions and ancient weapons.\n\nI actually really liked this about Outlaw, and the Jedi survior ones as well - kicking about inside the old High Republic tech gave a really good sense of the history involved. I liked the fact that they were both side-characters, inside the star wars universe, doing their own thing. \n\nThe only thing I didn’t like about Outlaw was no Hu on the jukebox. I enjoyed it a lot.\n\nIts a small thing but I do appreciate it when stealth games don't do \" Mission Failed\" on you for failing stealth and instead keep it going. You could make it unreasonably hard to survive being spotted and treat that as a mission failed type of thing and that's Infinity more exciting than forced stealth segments in games that don't do stealth well. \n\nSo good on them to he flexible about what their game is all about. They made a thing, it didn't work out and they make changes. I respect that.\n\nThe Dishonored franchise has done this perfectly so far, you can fully stealth or kill everything that moves in every mission. Just great stealth games overall.\n\nYeah I really, *really*, **really** didn't like the stealth mission in Zelda BOTW, so instead of doing it over and over I came back when I was a combat god and just killed a million zillion ninjas.\n\nI might also point out that this approach is [appropriately canonical for Star Wars.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bjEpLoL0ls)\n\nI think it’s not a good sign when you can change a major gameplay element like this so easily post launch in a game. \n\nLike yeah, the first pass at the mechanic is bad and this is better but the idea of “well we just took the stealth out of the stealth missions and they work fine anyways” tells me your mission design from the get go is meaningless. Just arbitrary goals. \n\nForced stealth shit almost always sucks. \n\nIt's terrible in games where sneaking isn't a main mechanic. Then suddenly you have a level design trying to force this new gameplay system on you. Rarely works.\n\nGreat example, Mary Jane and Miles missions in Marvel's Spider-Man\n\nThe MJ one in the museum where she calls Spidey to grab goons was ok, but the pure sneaking ones were dumb.\n\n[removed]\n\nWhen they are done right \"Chefs kiss\" like the sniper mission in call of duty 4. It's so awesome and didn't overstay it's welcome. Plus it's followed by one of the most intense missions in the game.\n\nAll ghillied up is by far one of my favorite missions in the original modern warfare trilogy! Playing it again i realized that it was pretty difficult to get spotted by the patrols but it still felt so tense\n\nThere's also Vendetta (World at War's answer to All Ghilled Up), holy shit is it an amazing tribute to Enemy at the Gates, as well as a great mission overall (both plot-wise setting the tone of the Soviet campaign and gameplay-wise). That sniper duel arguably made me be a sniper in FPS games to this very day.\n\nIt's usually fun in Zelda games, like the few sequences in the most recent, Echoes of Wisdom.\n\nThey’re using very sparingly in Zelda games, and in echos if you’re slick enough you can actually get away from the guard when he starts chasing you. Which is way better than instant failure.\n\nThen in 2, MJ is taking down the goons faster than Spider-Man.\n\nI never thought of that but holy cow is it crazy that Spidey takes like 10 basic hits to down a regular enemy, while MJ just fucking tases them and they go down in one hit and stay down for hours.\n\nOnce was fine but then we had to grab the goons in Grand Central Station. Sheesh.\n\nGrand Central MJ mission was excellent, easily the best of MJ's levels. It made her and Pete feel way more like a team\n\nI'm here to play a quipy springy fun superhero, why the fuck are you making me play as a wimpy useless normal character that has to sneak around because they're useless in context? \n\nI don't start up a racing game to spend 10 minutes in a shooting gallery and then go back to racing.\n\n[“It’s time for egg delivery!”](https://youtu.be/W1ZKcZbi1rg)\n\nProZD, the xkcd of geek culture\n\nThat reminded me of the random third person shooter gameplay on rogue squadron two on GameCube. It was garbage. \n\nThought that was rogue leader (#3).\n\n#3 was Rebel Strike.\n\nThis is why I hate the driving missions in Borderlands with a passion. I swear to God, if they have more forced vehicle missions in BL4...\n\nOh God those missions sucked. Felt like PS1 driving mechanics\n\n&gt; I'm here to play a quipy springy fun superhero, why the fuck are you making me play as a wimpy useless normal character that has to sneak around because they're useless in context?\n\nSo you actually bought Marvel's Spider-Man &amp; Mary Jane Watson Adventures. It's right there on the box. Common mistake.\n\nThe first Mary Jane segment extra pissed me off because going into it, they establish it's a flashback. Just make it a damn cutscene then. \"So then I totally got caught and died, Peter!\" - Mary Jane, apparently.\n\nI am just now replaying that game and my god the Mary Jane missions are dreadful. Just a complete buzzkill. If you’re gonna force another character on the player, at least make them lethal like Johnny Silverhand or Ciri.\n\nOof yeah I’m replaying Witcher 3 right now, just got to the first Ciri missions (Bloody Baron) and mm, mwah👌🏼 that shit is perfect. It even feels like I get a sneak peek at an endgame character. Holy shit I’m Tracer, I get to teleport around and be badass as fuck, dodge everything and get back into melee instantly? Beautiful.\n\nCutscene characters should be an order of magnitude stronger than the PC. It’s a *cutscene*. The enemies *should be* getting melted like butter.\n\nWhich they tried to fix in the sequel by having MJ be the single most powerful player character in the game lol.\n\nExplicit stealth IMHO is shit, implicit stealth is good.\n\nIe. You need to stealth because the alternative is an extremely difficult gameplay challenge because of how the map is designed and the tools the player has access too.\n\nDeus Ex is sorta a good example of this, early on stealth is key because you really don't have a big toolkit and the enemies will literally make it near impossible to proceed but once you get augments and better weapons stealth essentially becomes optional because you have in essence moved from some hacker kid to a literal hitman / assassin.\n\nThe earlier James Bonds games and Splinter Cell games are other examples though they have forced stealth they don't really need it.\n\nThen you have Cyberpunk which is lighter on the elements and you get to essentially pick how you want to approach a scenario in any given way.\n\nSame goes for Elder Scroll games, where you basically pick how you want to play.\n\nThe Splinter Cell games are built completely with stealth in mind, so I'd say they definitely need it.\n\n&gt; Same goes for Elder Scroll games, where you basically pick how you want to play.\n\nFar Cry as well. Maybe with a tilt towards the implied side especially for the early entries at high difficulty\n\nHad a ton of fun in FC2 saving before doing something &amp; trying all three ways. Sneak into a building &amp; grab something trying to have minimal interaction with soldiers (or use remote IEDs for things like convoys), blast thru everyone, &amp; the half approach of whatever's convenient\n\nFC clearing bases has always been a great example of good stealth design imo. You can do it without ever being discovered, you can take out any alarm or reinforcement thing, you can use the environment, and it makes it \"easier\" by virtue of having less enemies. The only downside is that clearing a camp is generally pretty easy so there's no real reason to actually do that aside of fun, but you can always design around that with more reiforcements, more rewards, etc.\n\nCyberpunk has the best balance imo. I love hacking from cover and then jumping out amidst the confusion to rain down fury and dildos\n\nI see the thoughts behind it, especially in games like Spider-Man that want to be cinematic. But it definitely isn't that fun to actually play.\n\nI’ve only experienced good forced stealth once, and it is so fitting within that stage of the game:\n\nThe Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker\n\nI still remember that as a kid I couldn't finish Fahrenheit on my PS2 due to a random stealth mission.\n\nThat stealth section did you a favor. If you got to the end of that game  you would've been so much more disappointed.\n\nUbi never learned from their shitty trailing missions in the correct ac games.\n\n‘Major’\nForced stealth is basically only in imperial bases. In all other scenarios you can just go in and shoot everyone.\n\nHonestly forced stealth to an extent makes sense. There are obvious scenarios where you would not be able to blast your way out. That the enemy is so strong to the point where surrender is the only option. I get *why* players hate it but having the game punish you for playing poorly isn't exactly unheard of.\n\nOnly problem is that you can basically shoot your way out of any situation, even surrounded by deathtroopers. So there are moments where one stormtrooper sees you and you give up, game over, when in the last mission you wiped out a battalion of them solo.\n\nI look forward to blasting my way through to the syndicate vaults. Its gonna be such sweet revenge. \n\n[deleted]\n\nMost forced stealth scenes try to justify it such as a hostage being killed if you're found out to be interfering, or something just as bad happening if your presence is noticed.\n\n\n\nSometimes they don't and that's annoying, on top of how annoying binary stealth scenarios are anyways.\n\nWas it easy? It doesn't say that anywhere in the article and we are roughly 3 months out from when the game launched.\n\nThey changed it because everyone hated it, apparently, and it didn't really fit with the rest of the game. This is literally what gamers keep saying they want developers to do - be willing to make big changes to their games in response to feedback if something just isn't fun/doesn't work.\n\nYet when developers do, especially if they're a currently unpopular developer or a developer under a currently unpopular publisher, they get shit on like this instead.\n\nAll it tells you is that the wanted to force stealth missions and designed those segments that way. They're now changing that, and we don't know how many other changes are going into those missions behind the scenes to support these changes.\n\nDo y'all even like games?\n\nThank you. Christ, people can be so negative\n\nI’m kind of hoping it doesn’t work at all and you just get totally destroyed in a drawn-out firefight. It would be more fun than just immediately starting over right as the fight is getting crazy.\n\nAren’t you pretty outgunned anyways?  You’re running around with a blaster pistol, I recall - you’re not a strapped soldier or hardened Jedi a la Battlefront or similar games.\n\nYou definitely get stronger as the game progresses, but yeah, usually in those stealth missions (which I enjoy) it kind of feels like a scenario where you’d definitely lose in an open fight.\n\nThe thing that's always frustrating is when you've nearly cleared the whole thing, then fuck up on one of the last few guys.\n\n\nLike yeah I couldn't have taken the whole base, but there's two dudes left now. Maybe give me the chance to fight and see if I can keep then away from the alarms instead of just declaring they arrest me and I lose.\n\nThere were only a couple missions that forced it. 90% of the game was stealth recommended. But allowed you to blast. It really felt like the og cast in the deathstar with Han failing to convince the storm troopers. \n\nSadly a lot of the forced parts were early, I think they were intended to teach the more complex parts of stealth, so action gamers would realize it's the main mechanic and utilize it. Being so early made it seem like the whole game would have this punishment. \n\nThey just made those sections too punishing. I quite liked most of the game but I nearly quit on those couple sections multiple times.\n\nWho are these theoretical people who have existed for like 20 years who like forced stealth sections in otherwise combat action games? They keep getting catered to but who tf are they?\n\nI thought the game was stealth first, action second, from the previews of it.\n\nThis is how I would describe it, having just fished it. It is a stealth first game. If anything, the moments where combat cannot be avoided are bad because of weapon inventory. You can pick up better weapons, but they have limited ammo and you drop them immediately.\n\nThe forced stealth was only really bad in maybe two areas.\n\nIf they drop the forced stealth, the resulting combat is going to suck unless they have better weapon management.\n\nThis is also being addressed in tomorrow's update. You will no longer drop weapons after every action\n\nThis was my impression and the main reason I took it off my wishlist.\n\nThe Pripyat stealth level in Modern Warfare was one of the best parts of that game.\n\nThey are the cousins of those other people. The ones that sit there playing and think to themselves \"Man, I could really go for an escort quest right now. Especially a super long one where the NPC walks at a different speed than me. It would be even better if it involved combat and the NPC died from a single hit and they didn't even try to hide. That would be so awesome.\"\n\nI’ll appreciate that if it ever hits Game Pass\n\nI honestly enjoyed it. The facial animations kinda suck but I can get past that. It’s one of those games that came out like 3 years too late. I still had fun though.\n\nWe had A+ facial animations in Half Life 2. Why do so many games still suck so badly??\n\nI'd prefer a straight fight to all this sneakin' around.\n\nGood, I hate forced stealth mechanics, especially with instant failure. They’re rarely ever done well and even then it just isn’t for me.\n\nForced stealth wasn’t the issue for me necessarily, it was the bizarre places they did or didn’t implement it.\n\nAre you in the wrong part of town? Haven’t done enough jobs for the syndicate that controls it (but jobs are available)? Forced stealth.\n\nImperial Orbital station with thousands of Stormtroopers, where you’re trying to frame a syndicate and remain anonymous? Blast away!\n\nForced stealth basically always sucks in general, I don't get why devs still do this, I get they want variety but the stealth itself isn't even good or interesting. Variety doesn't matter when it brings down the game\n\nIf the game is based on stealth to begin with its normally fine but these sandbox kind of games will do it too I don't get it. Like the first Spiderman Insomniac games those Mary Jane sections were so incredibly boring. That Phantom Liberty forced stealth section at the end was terrible too really\n\nExcellent news for the 7 people playing\n\nI’m gonna play this game… eventually…\n\nNgl... some of those forced stealth sections were what I enjoyed most about the game. It felt like the tensions were a lot higher and I needed to be more precise and creative.\n\n\"...so I started blasting!\"\n\nSo anyways.. I started blasting\n\nEverything I hear about this game reinforces my decision not to play it\n\nNeat, it sounded like stealth was the worst part of the game and didn't work well so this is a good solution. Hopefully it'll have a nice sale with its Steam release, looking forward to picking this up at some point.\n\nI don’t get why developers ever think taking control away from players is a good idea.\n\nNot the case for this particular feature, but it's the usual \"Given the opportunity, players will optimize the fun out of a game\"."

    "all_comment_text": "Same era, I’m still a huge fan of the Fable 3 “shut down the factory and turn it into a school, or employ child labor in the factory”. \n\nThose were not the only two options lol.\n\nOr the \"Make this an orphanage\" or \"turn it into a Brothel\"\n\nGreat game, the player to npc relationships were far ahead of its time\n\nLeaving out that, at that point you need to raise 3.5 million gold pieces to save the people of Albion when demons arrive, and “turning it into a brothel” gets you practically halfway there on one decision lmao fuck them kids, we can build the orphanage AFTER I save every fucking ungrateful one of you\n\nI just gamed the system by becoming a landlord, and just waiting until I had enough gold before I started the end sequence.\n\nI thought that was just what you were supposed to do. I didn't think there were people actually raising money by making the bad choices.\n\nThat was the whole point of fable 3 though? That the \"villain\" had a reason for being so shitty and that it was impossible to succeed as a virtuous person without cheating the system via landlording.\n\nNah, clearly the moral of the story was that landlords are the real winners\n\nFable 3 taught me that the best way to make money in the world isn't to work a job, fight evil, or make friends. The best way to make money is to sit on your arse doing nothing for hours on end while the plebeians' rent money flows in; just like in real life!\n\nThe moral of the story is that you can't amass wealth without being evil.  (Note: Landlords are evil.)\n\nnot like his \"reason\" ever held up to scrutiny, the very first choice in the game is him forcing the protagonist to choose between executing a group of protestors or executing their lover; he was just a bastard using that reason as an excuse\n\nSame, though, we kind of became the *TRUE* villain by becoming landlords!\n\n&gt; orphanage\n\n&gt; brothel\n\n&gt; fuck them kids\n\nBruh\n\nHomeless hookers, who says no?\n\nIt was a different time\n\nOooorrr... buy all the property, become a slumlord, and just watch all the money roll in. You can pick all the \"nice\" decisions and still have plenty of money left over to get the best ending.\n\nNot when I was 14 and didn’t understand money management I couldn’t\n\nOn that Rockefeller grindset\n\nMy favorite part about the conceit of fable 3 is that your brother who you depose is doing all this heinous shit because he knows he needs money to prepare to fight the demons that are coming.\n\nAnd then you take over and not only has all of his heinous shit gotten you 0 stacks of gold, it turns out you need to be even more of a dick to make a dent in the budget.\n\nLike child labor wasn't enough, you need ultra child labor to actually make a profit.\n\nBut wait, there's more! Taking the good options still gets you more money than that idiot was able to make being an evil fuck. where'd all the money go bro?\n\nFuck you mean make it orphanage or turn it into brothel?\n\nAn orphanage in the city needs renovations after the civil war. Also the darkness is going to eat the country next year. Use public funds to restore the orphanage, or convert it into a brothel, the money from which will fund the “save everyone from getting eaten by the forces of darkness” effort.\n\nIf you're smart, you'll just buy all of the available properties and fund your army through rent.\n\nThen if you're dumb, you'll accidentally get to the day the Darkness comes, forget to transfer your funds from your personal account to the kingdom account,  have an army with no funding and then watch the entire planet get eradicated.\n\nIt was really dumb that there was no prompt for moving to the last day, or any way to reset to the previous day.  Once the big day happens, you either have the gold you need directly in the kingdom's coffers or everyone dies, end of story.\n\nGood ol' Molyneux tryna make shits real and keep you on your toes.\n\nGoddamn 3 day bank transfer, we don’t have that kind of time!\n\nIt's my money and I need it now!\n\nJust call JG Wentworth, 877-CASH NOW.\n\nIf you’re in an apocalypse and you need cash now….\n\nWell you see the way my bank account is set up, I have a checking and a savings but all the money is in my savings and I gotta move the money from the savings to the checking and\n\nReally important to point out that the time progression is not linear and there’s no warning how much time is going to progress when you go from one period to the next. \n\nYou really don’t have any idea when the big day will actually come despite being told in advance when in fact, it will come.\n\nMake it make sense I dare you.\n\nYeah, especially since it goes like 1 Year &gt; 10 months &gt; 8 months &gt; 4 months &gt; APOCALYPSE TIME!\n\nI think the final jump was more extreme. It was like 1 month ish at a time and the last one was something like 6 months.\n\nLike... the fuck? Did I smack my head and fall into a coma?\n\nThose were almost Yahtzee's exact words in the Zero Punctuation from years ago.\n\n&gt;\"If only we'd been more prepared!\"\n\n&gt;Yeah, if only the king hadn't slipped into a coma for six months, and his tenants had paid their fucking rent!\n\nIt's really the only explanation. I think part of it was the main character couldn't tell anyone what was happening and just needed to act or something.\n\nAt least some games like Mass Effect 2 basically said \"After this point there's no going back.\" Can't quite think of others but I always enjoy a warning like that. I think Trepang 2 also had one for the last mission.\n\nCyberpunk 2077 is the most recent one I can think of that had something like that. In addition to a warning, it also created a save right before the end of the last mission.\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 also warns you at points of no return.\n\nYeah pretty sure I left Hanako playing the piano at Embers for 150 hours in my game lol\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 had a \"no return\" warning on it too. I really do appreciate those warnings.\n\nWasn't it a specific mission you had to trigger to advance? I remember never having any problems with waiting it out.\n\nYup you get assigned a mission each phase and when you complete it time advances.\n\nWas it at least obvious that the last mission would lead into the last phase? Or did the player literally have to guess?\n\nI remember suspecting something was up but yeah you basically had to guess. Like someone else mentioned, the previous jump was from eight to four months so you basically had to guess that the next jump would also be four months. The previous jumps were not in four month intervals.\n\nAlso if I remember correctly, the day everything actually kicks off is about 3 weeks in-game time before it's supposed to isn't it? \n\nSo eventually if you were preparing, your caught short on purpose.\n\nBecoming the only landlord in the country was really the only way to pick the \"good\" options, and still have a country left after Justin Hawkins rolls through.\n\nAnd it really IS good because despite murdering a bunch of people for their homes and giving the survivors the options to starve or be homeless, I lowered the rent to stop being so ugly after I had enough money! :D\n\nAnd now my wings are white, and everyone loves me again~\n\nThe public having short memories is a feature not a bug 😂\n\nSo, just like real life then\n\n&gt; get to the day the Darkness comes, forget to transfer your funds from your personal account to the kingdom account\n\nMan, I got bit by that too.  At the time, I was pissed; IIRC the game goes straight from \"6 months left, you can still raise funds\" to \"it's tomorrow!\"\n\nI at least understood it in hindsight -- you need to _raise_ funds and then you need to _spend_ them to raise an army to fight off The Schmooze or whatever it was.  \n\nBut the game didn't bother to inform you how long it would take to raise the army, which was a real dick move.\n\nAt least it's not Fable 2, though.  Shamus young wrote an [excellent post series](https://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=2102) demonstrating everything wrong with Fable 2's main plot.\n\nOr?\n\nReal estate.\n\nWhen in doubt, become a landlord.\n\nDidn’t it jump from like 63 days to go to day of, too?\n\nI also think it was dumb that they let you amass enough money to win the whole thing by being wholesome in your choices from day 1. Like, I get that they’ve always rewarded ‘pure’ playthroughs prior, but the moment you become king and learn that the prior king was a tyrant in preparation for the Darkness, it should have been a clue that you can’t just win by being a pure goody two-shoes people pleaser king.  \n  \nInstead, you can reverse all the bad decisions and be a benevolent king that everybody loves, but still build up your coffers to repel the Darkness in its entirety. Talk about marginalizing what was supposed to be the biggest decision you had to make in the game.\n\nIt kinda makes sense from a game design standpoint.  \n\nThe primary mechanic of the game is being good at combat, the ultimate reward needs to be a reflection of that otherwise your mastery of the game is irrelevant.\n\nIt should tie into that aspect and make the fights significantly harder both throughout and in the end game if you stay pure.  If your character is such a Billy Big Dick that he says he can remain benevolent and still protect the kingdom you should have to back that up.\n\nThis. But sadly, that would be seen as punishing the player. Few games can pull off getting punished for doing the right thing without upsetting the player, or even the right choice having unexpected consequences...\n\nWhy is the solution to an existential threat money? Really can’t just get buy in from everyone on that?\n\n*gestures broadly at the real world*\n\nworld on fire, people dying of starvation.\n\nMUH PROFITS!\n\nBecause people are greedy and will die before they do something for free without immediate benefit?\n\nSeveral hundred thousand died from COVID, and we had people saying it wasn't real. Global warming will eventually kill us, and people still claim it's fake. You think anyone would buy into this?\n\nI ended up spending hours playing the guitar hero mini game to try and get money.\n\nI became the landlord. Literally. **The.** Landlord.\n\nMuch easier.\n\nThis entire section of Fable 3 (the second half of the game essentially) was totally stupid. To have the good ending, you need to go evil, and if you go good your ending is bitter.\n\nUnless you just decide to abuse the real estate mechanics of the game to become stupidly rich and contribute your own money to the treasury.\n\nThis was my play. Everyone was being charged absolutely absurd rent by the only landlord in existence, me, but damnit they survived and did so happily.\n\n\nOr at least they did after I reloaded because the final day without being able dump all my money into the Treasury showed up with no notice.\n\nI was a full on monopoly man the entire game, reasonable rents until I had enough to buy all the property, then jacked the rents as high as I could to fund the army (this angers the NPCs) then once I had enough saved up I discounted the rent to as cheap as possible (which made the NPCs slowly like you more over time) and then when they were good with me I did the day of darkness, all in all a good ending and people liked me.\n\nThe dude I watched it play back then just had every rent always on maximum. Still got the good ending.\n\nOh damn I figured I had to take the extra time for people to get back to \"liking\" me as a landlord. I suppose getting to survive a travesty they would turn the other cheek to the rent prices though..\n\nOr you could go on tour as the hottest lute act in the land, crowdsourcing enough funds to save the kingdom through the sheer power of rock.\n\nDid he stutter?\n\nDiddy: “Why can’t it be both?”\n\nDrake*\n\nI had an enormous castle, why couldn't the orphans just live in my castle? I saw that orphanage, there was only like 6 of them.\n\nThe biggest problem with this game was, that these decisions were meant to be hard, but if you got enough money through rent before, you had enough money to save everyone AND choose all the \"good\" deeds.\n\nBut to do that you first had to become the most evil scourge of them all: A landlord.\n\nMade it a brothel one playthrough just to try and have as any illegitimate children as possible\n\nOpen brothel, create orphans\n\nFWIW the game really hits you with it at the end.\n\nThe evil king you overthrew? The one who levvied insane taxes, up military spending way beyond what it ever needed, and generally made life hell while forcing everyone to work ten times harder for half the pay?\n\nWell, turns out there is actually an ancient, Lovecraftian monster on the way. That evil king was straight up trying to stock up defenses to stop it while also keeping its existence hidden to try and maintain peace. A desperate, \"If you all suffer now and we stop it, I'll be less shitty and you all live; if you all suffer now and we don't stop it, we all die and it is what it is.\"\n\nThen you get to take his position and... Deal. You can be a goody two-shoes who lowers rent and taxes, but then you'll be unprepared against the monsters and everyone dies. Or you can become the evil king yourself and save everyone.\n\nOr you can do what I did: become a landlord, cheese the in-game clock, and get the best of both worlds\n\n&gt;Or you can do what I did: become a landlord, cheese the in-game clock, and get the best of both worlds\n\nI haven't played since it was pretty new, so its been a minute. But iirc my first run was full of edge-lordy evil douchbaggery, and then the second run I did the wild landlord stuff while being as good as I could while still having fun.\n\nThe landlord option was, as described by Yahtzee Croshaw, the solution “for kings with *working* brains.”\n\nF'real, by Fable 3 I think we all learned that being the One Landlord to rule them all was the true way of beating any Fable game\n\nFallout: New Vegas has a great dialogue moment if you shoot at the Battle of Hoover Dam memorial:\n\n\"What the fuck are you doing? My brother died at the Battle of Hoover Dam! You're desecrating a war memorial!\"\n\n\\&gt;My apologies. It was rude and disrespectful of me to do that.\n\n\\&gt;Yeah, whatever.\n\n\\&gt; You're a little bitch, and your brother was too.\n\nWasn't it LA Noir that had this weird thing during interrogations, where the selected option kept having the most unexpected delivery half of the time.  \n\n&gt;\\&gt; Maybe you can help me out?\n\n&gt;\"Listen here you little shit, either you play ball or I will smash you in the head with a baseball bat!\"\n\nMean while in space year 2023, Starfield presents you with a generation ship full of colonists who've arrived to find the planet they were going to colonize has been turned into a resort for the ultra-wealthy.  Your options are:\n\n1.  Using your own money, buy them a hyperdrive so they can go find another planet.\n\n2.  Help the evil corporate overlords of the planet enslave them.\n\n3.  Sabotage their ship so they all die\n\nThe *good option* is 'save the corporation an infinitesimal amount of money by spending a large portion of your own money.'  And you can't kill the asshole corpos because they're all marked as essential.\n\nAlso the generation ship has the last practicing Jew in the galaxy on board.  So...what exactly did Todd mean by this?\n\nNot to mention the entire choice hinges on the resort and the colonists being unwilling to share *an entire planet* between them. \n\n\"Oh no, we can't let these colonists set up a settlement in China. That might ruin the view for the tourists at Disneyland!\"\n\nI feel like that's a *really* recurring problem with sci-fi. We as humans aren't exactly equipped to think of things on a cosmic scale, so our stories often end up being \"the same plots as before but with \"planet\" instead of \"country/city/whatevs\" \" and it quickly gets all kinds of wonky\n\nNot to mention if you save them, they wander endlessly and you can never find them because Bug-thesda keeps showing the marker on Porrima 2 even though they aren't there. So I spend my creds, fix their ship, and they decide to keep wandering endlessly. How is this the better ending???\n\nFable 3s choices were so bizarre\n\n\"Drain a lake, which is permanent, for the valuable resources it contains to help fund the fight against a Lovecraftian horror that's about to befall on the land or keep it as is because 'it wooks pwetty 🥺'\"\n\nAnd you can bet your ass I kept it because it looked pretty\n\nMeanwhile i spent a few days just draining a poor village with some evil real estate choices and now i can afford anything for the war effort.\n\nLegends will be told of the great benevolent king who shared wealth and gave to his subjects, except for that one particular village he fucked over with extreme rent and taxes.\n\nI mean that's a pretty valid choice, its like deciding between a natural park or a coal mine\n\nFable games were so good for the time... Loved them very much\n\nFable 1 and 2 were also as black and white with their morality.\n\nSo was Fallout 3; and honestly Fallout 3 was probably the dumbest of all the \"moral choices in games\" from that era.  Do you want to nuke megaton? You'll get next to nothing in return, and lose access to Megaton.  Or: Do you want to poison the water supply of the entire Capital Wasteland?\n\nMoral choice? The fuck? I choose those options for shits and giggles because I want to be the Wasteland's biggest asshole on that playthrough. You know, for roleplay.\n\nMy favorite one in that game was \"Inconvenience yourself for 5 minutes or make hundreds of people suffer for life.\"\n\nIs this the decision where he has to turn the wheel and the oil shoots in his face? I remember my friend and I being like “close your eyes!”\n\nI was always just like “just pull the valve while standing next to it lol”\n\nClose. It's the one where the watertowers are full of the evil sludge.\n\nEach one limits your max energy storage for about 5 minutes.\n\nIts like they want you to pick the bad option lol\n\nIn the first game they absolutely did. The Evil powers were so much more cool and interesting than the good ones. The in the sequel it was the other way around and good was the clearly better thought out path.\n\nAnd then people were asked to wear masks and we found out this wasn't an absurdist joke after all.\n\nGod damn infamous was so cool back in the day.\n\nInfamous is so cool still to this day.\n\nI liked second sun a lot cause of the premise and the art style really popped for the neon power.\n\nIt was a solid game til you get to the rock power. Developers aid they rushed through that shit because Sony cut a year off their development because they wanted it to release with the PS4 debut\n\nRock power is literally after the end of the game lol\n\nI meant the level leading up to it. And it felt so tacked on.\n\nAlso felt like the game ended 10 hours too early.\n\nMGS V called…\n\n\n\n\n(Sahelanthropus on line 2)\n\nHonestly, I didn't really care for concrete or video, but smoke and neon are still two of my favorite powers in any video game I've played.\n\n[removed]\n\nI think Infamous got better and better with each installment, but a few years ago I went back to play SS and found the combat and gameplay loop really outdated surprisingly. Would love to see a new entry\n\nI too would love another Infamous game but Sucker Punch will most likely never return to it.\n\nI was stunned when I realized that Ghost of Tsushima, Infamous, and Sly Cooper were all made by the same company\n\nGraphics and performance was really good on PS5 BC mode though.\n\nI miss this era. Everything was edgy and cringe and it was cool as fuck.\n\nThe way I would preorder the living fuck out of a remake...\n\nI played the demo at Gamestop as a kid\n\nThe greatest game of my childhood\n\nYeah I still remember the comic style intro of how the mysterious package gave him powers.\n\nOr how the start of the game had you press ‘Start’ which immediately triggered the bomb within the package, so good.\n\nPlus how the ending worked in 2. Neat book-end.\n\nThis game sure had some very cool features, one of my favorite franchises on PS3. The way the neighborhoods transition from a gloomy/dark vibe to vivid/colorful one as you free them from the militia and how the NPCs treat you depending on your karma level wowed me back in the day.\n\nGliding along the power lines was awesome. Just sucking up electricity was cool too. I can still hear the sound in my mind.\n\nthe movement and the climbing were so smooth and the giant ground pound attacks were so awesome\n\ni literally spent a few hours of my playthroughs climbing up the side of buildings looking for shards. they were so good.\n\nInfamous was probably the last game I remember vividly buying because of the demos available at best buy/walmart/target. You got to do the train mission and it was so sick.\n\nI had platinum trophies in both of the first two installments. Crazy fun. Remember collecting shards was super chill and since I was a kid I had unlimited free time. I used to fire up the console and just walk for an hour around the city collecting shards. \n\n2 was literally the only game I’ve ever gotten the “collect all the (collectible that there are hundreds of)” achievement on. I just loved the map and traversal that much.\n\nOnly games I ever bothered getting Platinum on. Infamous 2 is a gold standard for sequels.\n\nI look past my sorrows of not having another infamous related game with happiness that at least Sucker Punch is still delivering on Ghost.\n\n\"Childhood\" , \"2009\"\n\nDear god....\n\nAre you a 90s kid? (Serious question)\n\n80s baby, but yeah 90s kid\n\nwhy not both?\n\nThe bad news is that your wife has passed away. The good news is that she won't be lonely in the afterlife.\n\n\"The good news is she'll soon have company.\" is better I feel.\n\nThis quote unironically goes hard af\n\ndirection fuzzy spark fly wipe sand plant close frame salt\n\nYou put out a bunch of hype trailers with Russell Crowe looking badass, leaping through the air ready to stab with dual swords and other cool shit like facing down lions in a colosseum. But secretly it's really a modern spin on *My Dinner With Andre* and the ending monologue is a scathing indictment of the audience for coming out to see what they thought was Gladiator 2.\n\nInfamous 2 was such a damn good game that built on the first one. I liked the 3rd one well enough but man Infamous 2 was something special\n\nThe ending wrecked me\n\nI always forget this era of „morality“ in games…\n\nKOTOR was a prime example, I remember thinking myself edgy choosing the dark side things, going back and playing as an adult is like \"Not even sith lords are this much of an asshole....\" xD\n\nIts not being edgy if you are just trying to lightning people cheaper.  Its strategic \n\n*Lightning Storm automatically attacks!*\n\nThere are some devastating powers in that series, particularly in the force choke line, but its just much more efficient to spam lightning storm.  Basically kotor's fireball\n\n\"It's 10 on 3, Jedi! You are outmatched!\"\n\n\n\"You talking mad shit for someone in Force Storm distance\"\n\nKOTOR had hilarious dark side stuff, though. Pitting the families on each other while I was supposed to reconcile them makes me laugh still.\n\nThat is such a fun mission, and so gratifying going evil, since both parents are so infuriating! However, possibly my favorite, funny evil moments is in the second one, where, if you have dominate mind, when these two guys are harassing you for money, you can use it to make them give **YOU** all their money... then throw themselves into this very deep pit!\n\nI liked how the MMO The Old Republic handed it, choosing Republic or Sith at character creation, then having \"light side\" and \"dark side\" for both. Republic dark side choices often still ended heroic, if not very \"the ends justify the means\", and Sith light side choices were still evil, but with less back stabbing and shooting the messenger just because you disliked the news.\n\nIt goes down the Mass Effect Route, where Shepard is still always \\*the\\* good guy, but he's either going to be talking someone down or shooting them.\n\nI recall the light side Sith Inquisitor essentially being \"the jedi can't get things done, the empire can, so i'll make a difference from here without the corruption and cruelty of the dark side\"\n\nIt's been a while but I remember them calling out my light side Sith Warrior as being a kind of force for change from within, which I appreciated\n\n&gt;Republic dark side choices often still ended heroic\n\nMeanwhile you've got Havoc Squadron over here pretending Garza doesn't have them filed under \"Warcrimes Incorporated.\"\n\nPoor poor Mission. 😭\n\nPoor Zaalbar.  If you do it right, you can force him to kill Mission.  That has always been one of the most ridiculous \"evil\" choices in any video game.\n\nYes, but you know a Palpatine-esque Sith would do it in a heartbeat\n\nİ feel like KOTOR 2 was much better in this but i am not sure. İ never finished\n\nNeither did the developers.\n\nas I said to the other commenter, replay it with the lost content mod, so so so much better\n\n(play it with the Restoration Mod)\n\nThe writing of KotOR 2 was better across the board and the contrasting choices were far less goofy because of it. But the most annoying thing about the game is that you're forced to pick a side no matter what. Neutral decisions are heavily punished over time gameplay-wise (you're flat out unable to finish a substantial part of Korriban if you're not heavily aligned in either direction). Super ironic considering what the overarching narrative is.\n\nI miss it honestly, it’s not something I’d like *every* game to have but morality can be a fun mechanic as long as there’s actual consequences\n\nI had high hopes when I played Bioshock that they were setting this up - you can kill the Little Sisters and be stronger, but then you get the bad ending, or you save them and have a harder time but they save you in the end.\n\nBut then they had them randomly give you gifts so you only wound up a little behind and had some unique powers and kinda ruined it.\n\nNot even a little behind- you would consistently end up a little *ahead*, you just had to wait a small amount of time before it paid off.\n\nMost implementations were mostly „good and you get the best gameplay benefits in the long run“ vs „evil, just for the sake of being evil - and often comically evil“\n\nI mean it was fun, when done well, it mostly wasn’t imo\n\nThis is why Fallout New Vegas basically ignored karma and went with faction/companion standings and making the outcome of quests impact the overall story. You could do some *evil* shit it that game but it usually tied into some kind of bigger goal\n\nThe fact that you could have good karma and also end with the Legion was a great use of a multi-scale for \"morality\".\n\nNew vegas is one of the better series to do the morality because you can actually choose to be on the spectrum of morality by tying it to factions. Whether you were good or bad didn’t decide who you were allies with. Ironically, Infamous is probably one of the worst cases of doing morality. The game heavily enforces the idea that you have to be all good or all bad due to being extremes giving power ups, there is no value in being in the middle.\n\nI agree but at least in Infamous's case there's the excuse of being a comic book and playing by comic book morality.\n\nTo be fair, you could say anything is fun when done well and not fun when it’s done poorly\n\nBioshock: kill children to become more powerful, or free the same children to still become more powerful, just mildly less so.    \n(No hate I love that game and consider it one of the best ever made, but that particular choice was *NOT* implemented well.)\n\nIIRC, freeing the children ended up giving you some pretty big rewards by the end, so I'm not even sure it was a less powerful route, more of a slower power curve.\n\nIt’s been a long time, but I seem to recall that while you do get a bonus for every few saved, it still ends up slightly less than if you killed them all.     \n*However* saving every Little Sister in the game is the only way to the good ending. So.\n\nI love looking back on reviews of Fallout 3 where “do you wanna nuke this city full of innocent people or not for literally no reason?” was seen as a complex moral choice in an RPG.\n\nOh but there *was* a reason!\n\nThe city was an eyesore!\n\nAnd you also got a cool apartment out of it. In all seriousness, that particular choice was praised more as an example of reactivity than any sort of complex morality. \n\nEven today, I can't think of another example of a choice in a random side quest allowing you to straight up wipe one of the major settlements off the map.\n\nI mean, they did base their settlement around an atomic bomb.\n\nIt is a *tiny* bit more nuanced than it appears lol, Brandon has jammed a door you need to get through, and he's not gonna let anyone in until he knows his wife is safe, but you found her corpse earlier (and saw a bio-electric memory of her being killed by the Reapers out of rage after Brandon ran away... so it's kinda his fault she's dead). So you either tell him she's dead, and maybe he'll let you in (narratively of course; gameplay-wise there's no question that he's going to let you in), or just decide not to deal with it at all and shoot him through the bars to knock him away and open up the jammed door.\n\nYeah it's not super compelling but it's not as bad as the objective text suggests.\n\n\"You will be reunited with your wife... **IN HELL!!!**\"\n\nI want an inFamous remaster on PC so much. Love this game\n\nAnd PlayStation...\n\nMan, they are sitting on so much potential money while they rerepolish recent games\n\nStreaming is fine if it's available but they really should be downloadable.\n\nDid streaming on this game in particular not long ago only to discover that my progress just disappeared one day while i was barely halfway through the game.\n\nHave a gaming PC? Try your luck with RPCS3. I heard there was good progress on InFamous.\n\nNah infamous doesnt work even a little.\n\nI fucking **loved** the freedom in these games. The karma-related powers notsomuch; but that was just motivation to play again (though I never finished Goodie-Goodie Cole run because the powers sucked.)  \n\nI spent about an hour staring at Prototype's \"Biohazard\" bundle on sale only to chicken out at the last minute.  \n\nFrom what I've heard it's basically InFamous, but your character is the Carnage symbiote.  \n\nAnyone wanna tell me how much I fucked up not scooping it up for $15? I know it'll go on sale again and I've got the Bioshock collection to keep me entertained; I just need the nudge to pull the trigger next time.\n\nRando Prototype and Infamous fan to the rescue! If you liked Infamous you'd probably like Prototype. 15 bucks for both games is a good deal and it'll be on sale again when the Christmas deals start up. Your description of Prototype is pretty spot on btw.\n\nYou can turn into a grandma, bodysurf a corpse down Times Square, then karate kick a helicopter. \n\nAlso you’re not the carnage symbiote, you’re the *fucking thing* with the apocalyptic implications of that. It’s so good. \n\nIf you liked Saints Row 4, it ripped off the traversal wholesale from Prototype, while having a worse map for Prototype-style traversal.\n\nPrototype is infamous if you had a symbiote and were really fucking evil for no real good reason lol. Oh and the gameplay is significantly more dynamic and kinetic.\n\nI miss Infamous. Did Second Son not sell well so they stopped making it? Wasn't it a flagship game for ps4?\n\nSecond Son sold way better than InFamous 1. They stopped making it to work on Ghost of Tsushima.\n\nSadge. Ghost is good but I miss superhero open worlds. I know spider man is there but his powers are pretty limited.\n\nMay just be that Sucker Punch is focusing on the Ghost of series now.\n\nI agree though, I'd love a 4th Infamous game\n\nSucker Punch got tired of making it.\n\nI'd rather they switch to a new series (thats amazing BTW) than milk it into a dessicated husk like Halo.\n\nClearly those were the only two options.\n\nCan someone tell me who was sitting back then in HQ and said \"You know whats tough moral choice? Taking a child and returning him to his loving family so they can live happily or killing a child infornt of his family\"\n\n2009\n\n\n- Leagueof Legends\n- Minecraft\n- Final Fantasy XIII\n- Plants vs. Zombies\n- Left For Dead 2\n- Borderlands\n- Infamous\n- Bayonetta\n- Prototype\n- Demon's Souls\n\n\nIt was a good year. Yes yes.\n\nAlso Uncharted 2, Assassin's Creed II and MW2, great year for amazing second parts\n\n\"All men are guilty of the good they did not do.\"\n\nThe hardest loading screen.\n\nYour wife is dead ( shoots)\n\nGod I love Infamous\n\n'Frostpunk has entered the chat' - Send the old off to the winter forest to die so the rest of your people may live."

    "all_comment_text": "I haven’t heard or seen anyone complain about how much Arcane cost to make.\n\nMore like Hollywood complaints and jealous of the Arcane mininum budget but with a high quality product on par or even more than the likes of Disney and Pixar.\n\nNow the ppl will start demanding higer quality on our movies - All big movie makers\n\nIt reminded me of the situation with the game Baldur's Gate 3. The developers complained that players will now have inflated requirements\n\nTheir \"we won't do DLC\" and then add stuff that would otherwise be a DLC or \"micro\"transaction (like 12 subclasses) isn't helping that stance\n\nI think there's maybe some Hasbro licensing fuckery behind that. Patches are \"maintenance\" and probably included in the original contract, expansions are not.\n\nI think it's also a mentality of delivering a *complete* game.  Part of the reason Cyberpunk 2077 has some \"dead\" areas of the city was they originally planned to release them as dlc later which didn't play out well (I'm a fan of the game, but not so much that I can't see the flaws of the studio).\n\n Larian's track record is that they haven't released any dlc to date.  \"That's leaving money on the table\" according to bean counters of AAA studios which is why they've all complained about the BG3.\n\nI think this is the case. They had a similar pattern with previous games.\n\nDivinity Original Sins 2 has a DLC that adds Sir Lora. A squirrel riding a skeleton cat.\n\nIs it just cosmetic or does it do anything?\n\nDies pointlessly and becomes a ghost, is otherwise a good goofy conversation and gifts you some abilities.\n\nWarframe plug. \nWhat a great free to play with zero requirement to shell out money, and free patches and updates to the game.\n\n[deleted]\n\nExcept games these days are now \"pay first, then pay more later\" models to extract even more money from you. Like Diablo 4.\n\nWasn't there an interview with the devs who said that? \n\nI can fully understand the concern tho. It's really hard to beat a 9-9,5/10 game, movie, show or whatever else with their next product.\n\nI sometimes think of Subnautica when it comes to this. The first game was easily a 9 out of 10 while the second game was ''only'' a 7,5 or 8/10 which is still extremely good but instantly made people really upset calling the game garbage compared to the first.\n\nA difficult thing for devs or producers I would imagine but that's what can happen if you try something new and don't fully understand your consumers.\n\nYeah Reddit was dumb about that quote. The point was not \"Boo hoo Baldurs Gate is too good, it's going to increase consumer expectations and that will make it hard for us to sell lower quality goods\".\n\nThe quote came from a small indie talking about how the things Baldurs Gate 3 does with scope, length, voice, missable content etc are totally impossible to achieve for 95% of game development and if consumers use that game as a bar for others to clear that leads to wildly out of wack expectations and an unhealthy ecosystem.\n\nThose expectations should still be used as a bar for anyone with a massive studio. People understand that a 3 man team working from some basement in georgia cant deliver a baldurs gate 3, but whats unfathomable is how publishers like ea and ubisoft are incapable of such games\n\nMaybe it's time to stop paying 5-10 producers ...\n\n\nAnd no need to pay millions for some VA just because he is famous actor and instead focus on quality story and animation..\n\nWell the 2 main VAs were famous actors, tho maybe not A-listers but def famous already.\n\nNot to mention all the big names they got to make the musics. But I think part of that was also that they allowed musicians to do their thing (even when they wrote it). In the end, turns out everything works better when you put creatives in charge of creation. Who would've known !\n\n&gt; In the end, turns out everything works better when you put creatives in charge of creation. Would would've known !\n\nHard agree on this. Creators basically put in a direction, but ultimately it's the artist's creation. And it shows. Riot's music never disappoints.\n\ni think he means hiring mainstream none VA to do VA work, innevitably costing tens or even hundreds of times more\n\nYeah \nLike vin diesel paid 50 mil to voice groot ..\n\n\nWe really needed such sums paid for a single voice line ? (In thousands of variations ?)\n\nIt's Baldur gate 3 drama all over again.\n\n\"Ho no, someone not really know outside of a small population just made a fucking masterpiece for less than 1/4 of our big budget thing, and now customer want us to do better :0\"\n\nMuch as I love Arcane, we have had some *really* good animation lately, especially on Netflix. Castlevania, Cyberpunk, Blue Eye Samurai...\n\nIt's mostly Disney that is only producing lazy slop.\n\nScavenger's Reign was pretty astonishing.\n\nThat's right but all those did not have the same impact in the general population, it's more niche. \nArcane is so much broader.\n\nSounds like the same level of complaints that were leveled at Baldur’s gate 3s success.\n\nThis being said series as Sandman has an budget of 165 milion$ for 11 episodes.The problem is if the series won't recoup its budget it will be canceled no matter how deliriously high quality it is,it happened in the past and it's not gonna stop soon.\n\nI would go as far as to say the quality is well above disney and pixar. The animations feel so lifelike, and the lighting, quick transitions, etc are completely unmatched.\n\n&gt;More like Hollywood complaints and jealous of the Arcane mininum budget but with a high quality product on par or even more than the likes of Disney and Pixar.\n\nHAVE THEY TRIED SPENDING MORE TIME TRYING TO WRITE BETTER SCRIPTS?\n\nThere are animators, or rather (imo), line managers complaining that they could have had a dozen series with that budget.  Quite frankly, as a laid off animator from Toronto, those people can go fuck themselves with a dusty tetanus-laden bat.  \n\nThe current situation of animation studios, especially in Toronto is that it relied on free labour for decades (unpaid internships they were illegal), constant crunch time (unpaid overtime due to misapplication of the animators as contractors or IT), and suppressed wages due to collusion (Disney et al) and the other aforementioned issues creating a precarious employment leading to a mentality of (not wanting to rock the boat).\n\nTo be fair, they could have probably made 2 or 3 regular series with that money if you take away all the bullshit companies do to keep costs down but it would not look remotely as good as Arcane (where every frame looks like polished \"concept art\").  There has to be a middle ground for pricing where people realize that animation/VFX/game workers are severely exploited and underpaid and crafting each frame with exquisite detail.\n\nI have and it’s basically people saying that Hollywood could do it for half the cost. You know, where all the labor strikes are.\n\nHollywood massively inflates costs to avoid paying residuals.\n\nAccording to their accounting, all Harry Potter movies lost money.\n\nYep, Morning Brew recently put out a video on this on YouTube where even movies like the LOTR trilogy are reported to be massive losses because of Hollywood accounting tricks\n\nLol, arcane  was produced in France, where 28 days of paid vacation are the norm, and post 35 hours per week are counted as 1.5x overtime.\n\n\nFor animators.\n\n\nHollywood has so many idiot managers that they couldn't make it for double the price.\n\nI was talking about it in the animation sub, but Hollywood legit doesn’t know how to do animation projects efficiently.\n\nThey’re still chasing a high amount of detail on a cartoony style despite having the technology to do more style with less detail needed, they pay MILLIONS to have celebrities voice characters, production is sometimes a mess because they change up stuff constantly.\n\nI know anime has its issues, but we could easily have better quality shows than them for the same amount they spend on current stuff by taking notes on how they efficiently balance fluid animation and budget. So many industries don’t have a problem coming out with quality stuff nowadays and even China caught up, Hollywood has more skilled talent, but literally wastes it by burning through the budget for the stupidest decisions.\n\nLike do you *need* Chris Pratt on a *MARIO* movie? You don’t need a celebrity to sell people tickets, it’s *Mario*, use that budget to add more substance.\n\nUnless they developed a recent acute allergy for money, if they could've, they would've.\n\nHollywood isn’t going to get that kind of writing or animation while trying to underpay people and lay them off as soon as they get what they want. You can really see where the budget went in Arcane and the passion that goes into it from it being done in house.\n\nYeah, Fortiche, the french studio that made Arcane pays their workers with a very good salary and work conditions. And they all are happy with the masterpiece they created.\n\nCrazy what actual fair industry ethics will do.\n\ndoesnt the cost of stuff like rings of power, the game of thrones or star wars/marvel shows kinda disprove that? those were expensive as shit per episode\n\nIronically the cheapest and most destined to be a failure Marvel show Agatha All Along (which no one asked for) turned out to be one of the best ones they put out because the cheap budget allowed the director room for creativity\n\n[deleted]\n\n&gt; I think ONE random person on Twitter complained so for some reason social media has turned it into this MASSIVE \"news\" story.\n\nHappens all the time, because negativity sells clicks, and most ppl dont read past headline\n\nYeah ... think this is more or less using negative comments to brag in response, and get it seen via journalists.\n\nThere have been movies with runtimes far shorter than what this show ended up being while simultaneously having larger budgets.\n\nI looked this up for another thread recently. Arcane (adjusted for inflation) pretty much cost the same as Wall-E. \n\nHollywood etc inflate their costs so they can pay people less that have % shares.\n\nAnd avoid tax\n\n\"We totally had to involve this consulting company that did nothing but hinder production for the low-low cost of $100M that totally incidentally belongs to my brother\"\n\nTheir is a lot of value bartering from movie companies too, where actual liquid cash isn't exchanged, but is still viable to be used as a liquid expenditure.\n\nYes, also my uncle's ranch was *the* best location for this shoot. Of course we paid a $5m site fee to shoot 3 shots there.\n\nThat doesn't really make sense. \n\nWhen they are inflating costs to avoid paying percentage shares, they do it by hiring their own subsidiaries so the money still goes to them. \n\nIf they were doing it to avoid taxes, then that subsidiary is just going to pay taxes on that amount. There isn't really any avoiding it. Now they might be shifting income around to offset losses, but that isn't really evading taxes, it's just taking a loss now vs over the next 10 years or whatever. A lot of industries do this.\n\nNot if the subsidiary is in another nation with little or no corporate taxes\n\nNot sure about the exact rules for entertainment industry but in general for most cases, the subsidiary would incur GILTI if it's a subsidiary of a US company without a substantial physical asset presence, and they would have to have pretty reasonable documentation for section 482 on the markup of any costs incurred by the foreign sub. Any FTCs generated would also not be able to be carried forward. Depending on how they're classed they could also run into BEAT by playing this game which would be really stupid. \n\nI'm sure there's plenty of games to be played around presenting the financial success side of things, but I don't think they're just paying expenses to their own foreign subs to avoid tax.\n\nThat's not *really* how that works, Hollywood Accounting goes on behind the scenes and isn't *really* related to the published budgets.\n\nThe main reason we know about the practice (aside from that court case decades ago where it got exposed, of course) is that many many movies *clearly* earned more than their production cost, in all the published earnings/costs figures, and yet *internally on the studio's bookkeeping* are still considered loss-making.\n\nThere’s the letter David Prowse received stating that Return of the Jedi hasn’t made any money so no royalties will be paid.\n\nWinston Groom who wrote Forrest Gump and got told something similar supposedly said he couldn't sell the movie rights to the sequel because he couldn't in all conscience drive a movie company to another massive loss if they made a film out of it.\n\n(They tried to pull the same stunt with him but ended up settling out of court but I think they settled out of court to avoid discovery of how the numbers were being manipulated.)\n\nAh so \"The Producers\" was actually a documentary.\n\nWith The Producers the plan was actually to lose money on purpose.  \n\nLet's say you sell 10% of the rights of the production to 20 people for 10 million each.  That's 200 million raised on a declared budget of 100 million.  You spent the 100 million real budget on the worst possible play/movie/game while you stuff the 100 million in a sock drawer.  When the production bombs, you tell the investors there is no profit and you lost all their money, but shit happens, and they knew the risks.  Now you run off with the remaining 100 million and nobody is the wiser.\n\neven movies reported to have “made a loss” made eve everyone involved several million dollars richer than they were before.\n\nthis shit is all a scam. and people fall for it time and time again.\n\nIf you pay yourselves and your buddies a ton, the movie doesn't make a taxable profit. Brilliant.\n\nEssentially, yes. The simplest version is:\n\n- you, the movie studio, are one company, that owns a bunch of professional production services: StudioCo\n- you create a new company solely for each movie's production efforts: Movie1Co, Movie2Co...\n- you charge out your own StudioCo production services *to Movie1Co* at ridiculous rates\n- because Movie1Co is wholly owned by StudioCo, no actual money needs to change hands\n- *but* your bookkeeping for both companies can show this to the IRS/whoever as evidence that no profit was made\n\nArcane does a lot of smart things to keep the budget down. They lock in their scripts and storyboards really early so there's very little actual animation waste, according to the showrunner around 5% compared to around 40% for a lot of other studios. \n\nMost of the show is also not 3D but 2D paintings with 3D characters. This combined with the more stylized and less technically demanding art style compared to say pixar and you get a far faster production schedule. \n\nThe studio being based in France compared to say California is also probably a bit cheaper salary wise.\n\nThat locking things down in scripts/storyboard is definitely nice.  \nSpeaking from experience, I've watched clients after director did their takes/passes on shots just to watch entire sequences get fucked up or redone because they didn't bother to figure it out in storyboard/script. I was a very mad animation revisionist during those times.\n\nDisney wants their CGI artists to practically storyboard their movies in fully rendered cgi—and then inevitably scrap and rework it.\n\nApparently Lord and Miller (21 Jump Street, fired from Solo, Into the Spiderverse) are *infamous* for doing this\n\nOn the flip side: George Miller used tons of storyboards in Mad Max: Fury Road. Whole movie was meticulously mapped and therefore was \"easy\" to shoot.\n\n&gt; less technically demanding art style compared to say pixar \n\nErrrr no, very much the opposite.\n\nWith Pixar movies you have \"just\" a standard ray-traced 3D pipeline, as has existed and been evolving for decades now. The 3D modellers create the models, the riggers rig them, the animaters animate them, and they're done.\n\nWith this modern \"it's 3D behind the scenes but looks 2D and hand-drawn\" aesthetic that's been hugely popular the last handful of years you have all that *plus* all the *actual* hand-drawn touch ups they have to do to make them look hand-drawn. Making 2D art look good when it's wrapped around 3D models is very much not straightforward, because it just looks uncanny and wrong if done in the most straightforward way you could imagine doing it.\n\nYes their engine doesn't need to be doing as realistic a light simulation as Pixar's does, but that's not animation work anyway that's just CPU/GPU horsepower. Pixar will need a bigger renderfarm, but Arcane takes more manual effort.\n\nAs a former animator I always think it's adorable that people think multimillion dollar budgets are justified by animators working more or less hard.\n\nTbh. If you have 50 animators working for 2 years on a project. That is already easily 5 million in salary. Add licenses and workspaces and you are looking at closer to 10-15 million.\n\nOr simply put, a lot of animated stuff from Pixar or Disney cost much more than Arcane if you break it down to cost per minute. Arcane might've cost $250m, but it's ~12h long. Granted the ROI is not the same because it's intended for streaming and not theaters.\n\n&gt;Granted the ROI is not the same because it's intended for streaming and not theaters.\n\nIs it? I've never played LoL but am seriously considering getting netflix back because I want to see it's second season\n\nThe ROI is just a lot more murky and hard to measure. \n\nFor a movie, you count how many dollars you made from tickets. For streaming, you kind of need to weigh how many new subscribers you got,  how many people aren't *unsubscribing* that otherwise would have unsubscribed, etc...\n\nAnother immeasurable is how many people who watched the show are now playing LoL because of it. Either people who stopped and picked it back up, or even first timers that didn’t know these characters came from a video game. I’m willing to bet it’s not a small % increase.\n\n&gt;  first timers that didn’t know these characters came from a video game\n\nImagine going into the game because you liked Arcane and then getting suckerpunched by the sheer toxicity of your average LoL lobby.\n\n\"I love Caitlyn. Wow, she's in a video game? I'm going to try that! What's a bottom diff?\"\n\nHonestly I really doubt the aim here is a pipeline from Arcane into LoL; more likely it’s building the brand for more name recognition and user acquisition when they release future projects with broader appeal than League.\n\nMy wife really wants go try the mmo now - arcane worked\n\nAfter watching season 1, I am 100% on board with a story rich single player game in this universe that drops emotional bombs and leaves the player with post-game depression for a month.\n\nIts just a shame that game doesn't exist yet for me to throw my money at.\n\nRuined King: A League of Legends Story (or the other single-player games set in that universe) didn't do it for you?\n\nOr the increase in skin sales, they have a very expensive Jinx skin coming out with a bunch of other character skins based on the Arcane universe.\n\nArcane is my favorite piece of fiction now. I love the characters so much. I would say it is easily worth picking up netflix 1 month for it. Worth rewatching season 1 before going into season 2 as well. The show has so many small and wonderful details, you  will probably pick up on new stuff while also refreshing yourself for season 2.\n\nI heard it was good and had friends addicted to LoL so I kinda stayed away \n\nBut checked it out this past week and good fucking god is it captivating, plus you know there's so many little things in the background that make it all just so much more nuanced and compelling. \n\nThe 3D and facial expressions are A+ tier. It's like Beastars levels of 'wow this was an option?' and stylized so nicely, in a way that complements the tragedy and griminess of an exploited/oppressed undercity. Voice acting all A tier. \n\nYou have to watch the first few episodes together IMO.\n\nThe first 'music video' stylized fight had me simultaneously hype beyond belief but also holding off tears, can't believe I haven't come across that shared by itself, but I guess it also hits dramatically harder with the background.\n\nStill crazy to me how much it costs to make a show like this. I'd be curious to seeta video breakdown of \"Arcane\" but a $250M version vs $100M vs $50M etc and see what the difference is.\n\nLegitimately: 250 million dollars is the same budget as Red One, the new Dwayne Johnson christmas movie. \n\nThe first 10 minutes of Arcane are significantly better than the entire movie put together.\n\nAnd the 250m include marketing costs already, which were another 100m for the red one...\n\nArcane cost 250M, was a master class in animation and art design, and had so much hidden depth that you can find hidden details in half the frames.\n\nFor comparison something like Solo (a Star Wars story) had a 250M budget + marketing + reshoots and it had gems like:\n\n\"Han what? Who are your people?\"\n\n\"I'm alone\"\n\n\"...hmmm Solo\"\n\nLater in the movie he talks about knowing his father, who presumably has a last name that Han also has, if having both a first and last name is even a universal constant for the various Star Wars races.......\n\nIronically, if taken at face value, this adds a lot of depth to Han's character.  Because it means he had a father, had a last name that he knew, and gave *so* little of a shit about it that he was perfectly willing to hear someone call him \"Solo\" and go \"dang, I like that, yeah, I'll use that for the next fifty years\".  He kept the name Solo even through having a *bounty on his head* that presumably changing your name might help you avoid.  That says a *lot* about his relationship with his dad, even if I firmly believe it was not at all meant to.\n\nHe also gives his son his fake last name (and gives his son the first name of a man he only knew for like a day and didn't really get along with).\n\nYa, It costs as much as a pixar film, but it's 6 times longer and looks fantastic. There should be ZERO complaints about the budget\n\n&gt;Riot Games co-founder Marc Merrill wrote \"Since I'm here I'll add – the 'lol @ the cost' of Arcane arguments are silly from our perspective. As people have correctly pointed out, the cost per minute of Arcane is about 1/3 to 1/4 of what Illumination / Pixar films cost.\"\n\n\nThat quote reminds me how 90% of the highly upvoted and often parroted opinions of PCMR and this sub are often really dumb takes that anyone serious in the industry will roll their eyes at.\n\nA lot of it goes to marketing, and I feel Arcane did a great job being attractive all by itself.\n\nAlso the whole cross promotion with League.\n\n&gt; A lot of it goes to marketing\n\nIf we're talking the budgets as published by movie studios about their movies, then no those figures never include the marketing spend. P&amp;A (prints and advertising) costs are rarely talked about in specifics, and movie industry pundits usually just *very loosely* guesstimate them as approximately being as much as the movie's production budget was.\n\nFor Arcane they did include the marketing costs in the 250 million, and afaik haven't disclosed the split.\n\nyeah i don't understand the constant blaring of the budget. who gives a shit. why are they acting like it's unreasonable?\n\nBecause some people want them to go with studios that won’t pay their animators.\n\nYeah, that's what I was thinking too. Okay, $250 million is a lot of money, but it's not *that* much money for 18 episodes at ~45 minutes each when comparing it to a modern movie budget.\n\n\nI'd be more annoyed if it felt wasteful, but Arcane is *super* well animated, acted, and scored. That money was well invested into a really good product.\n\nBG3 comes out and it's absolutely fantastic and makes AAA companies look bad.\n\nExecs \"Guys this is making us look bad, they actually put effort into their game instead of penny pinching and cutting corners to maximise profits for shareholders and execs, what should we do?\"\n\n\"Lets just put random shit out in the media to try and make it look bad and give us excuses to keep doing what we are doing\"\n\nOh wait we are talking about Arcane.\n\nArcane comes out and it's absolutely fantastic and makes a lot of big Hollywood and media companies look bad.\n\nLiterally no one is complaining about it's budget and just praising it for being a good show.\n\nExecs \"\"Guys this is making us look bad, they actually put effort into their show instead of penny pinching and cutting corners to maximise profits for shareholders and execs, what should we do?\"\n\n\"Lets just put random shit out in the media to try and make it look bad and give us excuses to keep doing what we are doing\"\n\nLike lets be real $250m for 12 hours of high quality animation, writing and voice acting does not seem remotely as crazy as I see some media outlets trying to make it seem.\n\nDoesn't sound so bad if you phrase it as \"6 movie length, top-quality animations for 41.66 million each\"\n\nAnd that's including marketing, which is usually omitted from budgets by Hollywood.\n\nAlso with unusually little crunch compared to many comparable projects.\n\nThey do have an easier time for marketing thiugh since they can put it out for cheap on the league platform and millions will see it every day.\n\nThey did a fantastic job of letting it simmer. Arcane is big outside of League now, like with my girlfriend who didn’t even know there was a game. 250m is sincerely impressive by any metric, especially considering their resounding success.\n\nMy little autistic sister, who has never wanted to sit down and watch a show with me has now BOOKED ME EVERY WEDNESDAY TO WATCH AN EPISODE OR TWO.\n\nI will be skipping one or two scenes, but it makes me so happy that she's so excited to watch this show with me.\n\nThe number gets even more reasonable when you consider that the show doubles as an ad for league of legends, probably drawing in new players. (Don’t fall for it guys)\n\nAlso easier to market when you make a good product\n\nThis seems more likely, its kind of a weak argument when you realize disney is in that \"other\" group, wouldn't say they don't have any platform to cheaply advertise on :P\n\nIt's even separated into distinct arcs, too.\n\nAdam Sandler pays himself and his friends $250 million to make generic trash: nobody bats an eye\n\nArcane spends $250 million realising the vision of a broad team of artists: everyone loses their minds\n\nSandler's slop is the same as other Hollywood bloated garbage so it doesn't worry them.\n\nNailed it.\n\nTL;DR they went for quality and feel instead of efficiency and cutting corners to award their managers and producers and it resulted in one of not the greatest video game adaptions in recent times. It's like the BG3 thing all over again \"nooo it's too much what about our cookie-cutter production and profit margins\".\n\nWas reading the book on the history of Blizzard. League of Legends basically started out as a game mode in Warcraft 3, called Defense of the Ancients. Blizzard at one point had the original developer of DOTA in for an interview, asking if he wanted to make this Warcraft 3 gamemode into a full-fledged game. And he said yes *if* he gets absolute complete creative control. Blizzard declined, and sent him on his way. Blizzard then mostly scrapped the idea of making a MOBA. \n\nLater, Blizzard execs internally were *pissed* that Riot created League of Legends and effectively stole the thunder and the entire MOBA market. They were so pissed that they basically made Heroes of the Storm out of spite, insisting they could take the market back by just putting the \"Blizzard magic\" into the MOBA genre. \n\nI mention this because again, a number of years later, Blizzard was in talks with Netflix for an Overwatch animated series. But it completely fell apart due to legal disputes between Activision suing Netflix over poaching its CFO. Riot once again steps in, gets the Netflix series, and spits in Blizzard's face by getting done what Blizz could never do.\n\nStill pissed we didn't get an overwatch series all because of some bullshit lawsuit\n\nAnd just in case anyone didn’t pick up the name,\nDefense of the Ancients.  DOTA.\n\nDota and LoL are twins from the same set of minds that made the WC3 mod.\n\nI was more of a Dota guy, but Arcane slaps so hard in every metric.  The Dota anime was mostly just… kinda unfortunate.\n\n&gt; And just in case anyone didn’t pick up the name\n\nThank you. I missed that.\n\nWhich sucks because, although I enjoy league more, DOTA has some pretty sick and deep lore that deserved to be better explored than what we got.\n\nI just know that if Valve found a way to sic their own writers, artists and animators on their own original series, they could absolutely smash it out of the park too.\n\nWould take decades, of course, and probably delay any games they're working on by as much, but it would be top notch.\n\nDota anime was fine in my view, it was different style and less writing. but the worst thing about DOTA is that they can't use any of the original heros as they are blizzard owned IP.\n\nIt's sad because Valve have some competency in 3D animation and story telling, just watch any TF2 short movies or the latest Crownfall cinematics.\n\n[There was some talk of a TF2 show](https://me.ign.com/en/team-fortress-2/58131/news/adult-swim-and-valve-are-teaming-up-forsomething), but Cartoon Network was basically like \"Valve, ya'll take way too long\" which wasn't exactly incorrect\n\nSmall correction; League of Legends is a derivative of DotA (and before that Aeon of Strife). Riot founders identified the Warcraft 3 mod as something that could be supported and monetized ad-nauseum. \n\nNeither Beck nor Merrill actually had any hand in development of the Defense of the Ancients mod. They were MBAs, not game developers. I don't think either of them were ever interviewed by Blizzard for a dev job.\n\nThe ~~original~~ developer of DotA, Icefrog, was later hired at Valve to become the lead developer on DotA2. Icefrog approached Blizzard for a job to make it a standalone game around the release of StarCraft 2, but they were uninterested, and told him to recreate the mod for free in that game.\n\nBlizzard later sued Valve for exclusive rights to the DotA brand, which they settled. Blizzard wanted to use DotA as the original name or part of the branding as part for Heroes of the Storm.\n\nI think you've got your stories wrong, or mixed them together.\n\nEdit: I think you got your stories very wrong, actually.\nEdit: Icefrog was not the original creator of the mod, mb.\n\nSlight correction on this, DotA was actually made by Eul and then turned into Allstars and updated by Guinsoo and then continued to be updated, balanced, and maintained into the super popular version that took off by icefrog.\n\n&gt; Guinsoo\n\nWas he later hired by Riot, or did \"Guinsoo's Rageblade\" just happen as a \"memorial\"?\n\nYes he worked at riot, and also yes it is named after him. (AFAIK he helped implement it)\n\nEul's Scepter. Guinsoo's Orb. Good times. Reading all this makes me feel super old. 👴 Sigh\n\nGuinsoo, who is one the creators of LOL, handled the Dota project, before Icefrog inherited it FYI. Icefrog is not the original creator of Dota. \n\nIirc Guinsoo recruited Icefrog to do the coding side down the line, and later left the project in his hands with Neichus, after Neichus left, it was all Icefrog. Guinsoo primarily acted as designer, if i remember correctly. He was later hired by Riot founders, Beck and Merrill.\n\nI should have used the word developer instead.\n\nAlways hear about Pendragon being associated with LoL, which pisses off older dota fans because he ran a dota forum inclusive of things like new hero ideas. When he kicked off with League, he shut down the forum and effectively stole those ideas and put them into league.\n\nHe didn't just shut down the entire forum (essentially blocking the main way that playerbase communicated), he put a banner up directing them to league of legends. When there was obvious backlash he promised to provide archives which took him almost a year and was incomplete.\n\nThere are few early league champs that were shamelessly stolen from that community.\n\nAs a former Heroes of the Storm player I'm thankful the servers are still alive, but really sad that it's essentially running on life support with no new characters added since 2020\n\nThere’s a book about this? I lived through the OG DOTA. The custom game modes in Warcraft 3 were the best part of that game; and DOTA was just 1 out of a bunch of great game modes\n\nI still find it crazy that this happened. Like the original DOTA was so much fun with friends and it was just a mod. There was absolutely nothing like it at the time and was ripe to be turned into a massive thing. Like just a dash of common-sense they would have known to let this guy have what he wanted but now he has his own billon dollar empire all because Blizzard thought they knew better.\n\nWell blizzard had all its eggs in World of Warcraft so it was also prob a decision to not take that thunder away, but a bad decision ultimately in hindsight, as the 2 games really helped each other out with telling the story of warcraft\n\nYeah, I have the BG3 vibes as well. I haven’t read the complains from other companies yet, but I’m sure they will follow the same pattern again.\n\nIt’s not just a great video game adaption. Cyberpunk Edgerunner is a great video game adaption. Castlevania is a great video game adaption.\n\nArcane is one of the greatest triumphs in the history of the animation medium, period. \n\nIt pushed boundaries in a way similar to some of the greatest Disney, Pixar, and Studio Ghibli works.\n\nThey're a milestone in animation history for sure.\n\nHideo Kojima was like Arcane is the future. Can’t get more approval than that.\n\nis there a need to justify at all\n\nHollywood is mad. They didn’t expect Arcane to be so successful.\n\nYou mean it was good without hiring Chris Pratt and every other A-list actor to sell a movie just because their names attached?? Say it aint so!\n\nthat's a weird spelling of Jack Black\n\nI think you misspelled Dwayne Johnson\n\nI’m grateful for the rock, I know anything he’s in is gonna be so mid I can save my money\n\nI mean Hailie Steinfeld is one of the leads, and is a pretty big actor.\n\nThey’re mad because the quality is far superior to what Hollywood would produce with twice the budget\n\n**250 mil for about 12 hours worth of animation.**\n\nThats comparable to an animated movie with a budget of about 40-45 mil. Which is NOTHING.\n\nTangled was **260 million for 1 hr 40 mins.**\n\nThe Lion King was **250 million for 1 hr 58 mins.**\n\n.\n\nYeah its a gaming company and they did it right and they didn't try to milk a crazy payday out of it.  \nIt being a gaming company means **they can't afford to throw around a quarter billion for supplemental media content** when they need to be spending it on the games.\n\nBut it also puts the entire movie and streaming industry on blast for how overblown their costs really are.\n\nTo be fair, Tangled is that much because it includes to cost to built the technology Disney is still using to produce their animated films today. Same with Lion King and their ‘Live Action Pipeline.’\n\nAnd this 250m includes making the whole fortiche company, this has been an 7/8 in which riot hired fortiche for a music video and them made THAT make these series almost from the ground.\n\nOn that note Riot has always been an animated music video company. 😌😂 not sure if always. But at least since 'Get Jinxed' this meme has been around.\n\nRiot is known for making great animations, music, art, lore! Game, what game 😅\n\nI am legitimately bummed that Riot had to shut down their indie game publishing arm because none of their outreach stuff is contributing much ROI. I've heard the games were good and in a currently IP-saturated market it's really cool that small teams were getting the chance to have success by making something based on the League IP (even if I don't care about it).\n\nThe same goes for *Arcane*. This studio and team has been set up for massive success by this, but all reports seem to indicate that the money spent as a marketing expense simply isn't worth it. And Riot's not independent - they have to answer to Tencent who has profit motivations well above anything artistic. I don't see this sort of production continuing, though perhaps the strides Fortiche has made will effect the larger animation world (and hopefully make it more mainstream).\n\nCan I watch this and enjoy it without knowing anything about league? (Aside from the supposed toxic playerbase)\n\nEdit: ok ok I’ll definitely watch it!\n\nYes.\n\nI knew absolutely nothing about anything to do with the game. Never even seen a gameplay trailer. \n\nLoved the show. The animation, the characterisation, the fantasy world depicted. It has excellent dialogue and storytelling.  The art is magnificent.\n\nFirst 5 min of the show I wasn't sure, after that I was hooked.\n\nSame, and I might say it almost helped.  Reading things later, it seems like League players definitely *expected* various twists and turns because \"we know this character has to get these magic powers eventually\" kind of thing.\n\nI had no clue.  I didn't even know the big initial inciting incident was coming, because I had no idea who these characters end up being by the time of the game.  It was grrrreat.\n\nYou dont need to know anything going into it\n\nMy friend who does play league told me it's *better* if you DON'T play league because you don't know which characters can't die (because they need to show up in the game!)\n\nThis isn't true anymore, since the game actually \"summons legends\" from their peak power. So anyone can die, and when you play them they're at their prime instead of their \"current\" status. This is massive because it broadens the lore, so you can make a world not limited by timelines (this character can't die coz this character interacts with him).\n\n\n\nHowever, he is right that going in blind is still a treat since you immerse without thinking how character A will become/get to be character B.\n\nthere are dead characters in game tho\n\nMoney well spent for the developer and a great experience for the audience.\n\nso 18 40 minute animations cost the same as one dog water 90min mass market animated movie? genuinely what is the problem. If we can't spend money on this what the fuck is the point?\n\nIt's like 6x the duration and 3x the quality, riot really outdid themselves with this one and I wonder if there will be a trend for actual good animated shows now\n\n[removed]\n\nIt is kind of insane considering Cyberpunk Edgerunners' budget was reportedly under $4 million but that says more about how brutally underpaid anime studios are in general.\n\nEdgerunners had several things going for it. In addition to your point about salary - the animation is nowhere close to Arcane - each frame of arcane is a painting, it is unreal. Arcane has full body movement etc while edgerunners sometimes has characters moving around a fixed background and all that. Edgerunners also was likely easier to make - they had a fully 3D rendered Night City. Animators could quickly choose locations and draw what they want while for Arcane everything was from scratch. Edgerunners borrowed many things from the game. \n\nI loved both, but Arcane is just magical to look at, and every penny of that $250 million shows up on screen.\n\n&gt; Arcane has full body movement\n\nArcane has 3D animated characters, while Edgerunners is 2D hand drawn animation. They are completely different.\n\nI agree, I was only pointing out that Arcane inherently requires a bigger budget because of its style - in Edgerunnere some shots have only mouth moving while in Arcane every single detail is animated. So comparing the budget does not tell the whole whole story.\n\nArcane is far more complicated though\n\nI never played a single game of league. I started watching Arcane 2 months ago in anticipation of season 2.  \n  \nDespite not knowing any of the characters, I was enthralled from beginning to end. This is clearly a labor of love.  \n  \nThey spared no expenses on the soundtrack, take a couple of minutes of every episode to create what I would like to call works of art. Montages with amazing art and music.  \n  \nI can go on and on about Arcane but you really should just watch it.  \n  \nI went into Arcane expecting nothing and came out considering this to be one of the best animation series of all time. And I've watched anime for over 25 years.  \n  \nI think this is a very worthy investment for Riot because League isn't going anywhere and Arcane will help to market it for years to come.\n\n\\&gt; Despite not knowing any of the characters, I was enthralled from beginning to end. This is clearly a labor of love.\n\nThat's what the show did so well. You didn't need to have any knowledge of anything. It introduced the audience to the world and characters as if they had no idea who or what anything was.\n\nEach season is basically a trilogy of movies.\n\nThe Star Wars sequels cost over $1 billion to make. \n\nThe same raimi spiderman movies cost just over $500 million.\n\nLOTR trilogy was about $280 million\n\nInto the spiderverse and across the spiderverse have cost $90 million and $100 million respectively.\n\nWhile most of those movies have a longer runtime than the ~100 minutes of each act of arcane, the quality of the show compared to many other shows/movies, especially things coming out recently, is much higher. When you focus on quality and work on a season for 3 years, it may cost a bit more, but after watching the season it’s clear that money wasn’t wasted.\n\nMeanwhile ghastly hollywood remakes have 500million budget and looks like a 1990 cgi fest. And sucks.  \nArcane overdelivered in every aspect and has replay value.\n\nGood animation is fucking expensive. I remember reading that avatar: the last Airbender cost about a million dollars per episode and was the most expensive show Nickelodeon had ever made. It shows. And that was *with* a lot of outsourcing. \n\nThe comparison is a bit wonky of course, very different kind of animation and all that, but still. Think of it this way: if you film a scene of two people in a room talking, that can be done quite cheaply. You can use an existing room, the people and what they're wearing don't have to be created from scratch for the occasion, even the equipment can be stuff you already have anyway. If you want to do the same scene in animation, everything needs to be created from zero and you still need to hire the actors to perform their lines. The obvious solution is to cut corners wherever possible: only draw the room from one angle for an establishing shot, have the characters in that wide shot be static silhouettes, draw their closeups against a color gradient background or something. Only animate their faces when they're talking. Reuse poses as much as possible. Show the speaking character from the back. And so on. You see it a lot in serialized anime, but also in western animation. Knowing all that, look at Arcane again. All the shots that were more elaborate than they strictly needed to be. Every background detail that's only seen for a fraction of a second. Without paying too much attention, you'll just say \"it looks good\", but if you stop and think about what you're looking at you'll get why making it look that good takes a shit ton of money.\n\nWhenever characters changed clothes in arcane I was wondering if they had to sculpt a whole new 3D model for the new outfit. And they change a lot.\n\nmy thought was, fuck I'm gonna have to buy this as a skin now\n\nThe show is worth whatever amount of money it costs.\n\n??? Arcane is amazing, who cares about the budget? Be glad that Netflix made something watchable for a change\n\nBut Netflix didn’t make Arcane, they just released it. Probably why it’s good as Netflix had no creative control\n\nExplains why it didn't get canceled after an incredible first season.\n\nLaughs  \nCries in MindHunter\n\nNetflix made a good decision deciding to host it I guess, I've seen so many people thing Netflix somehow made the entire show lmao\n\nHonestly the budget is pretty normal for animation. Take the look at some of the cost per hour of content of far lower quality animated products.\n\nArcane was cheaper in some stats, and more expensive in others.\n\nOh for sure im not saying it was cheap, but i think some people dont realise animated stuff just tends to be really expensive.\n\nNetflix had nothing to do with making the show\n\nGiven the total runtime I think many people are just jealous and that investment is more than fruitful\n\nAlso, like..no one is really complaining it’s a controversy being pushed by some people on social networks \n\nWorth every penny. I loved the show so much.\n\nS2 E7 was peak\n\nThere were so many times during this show where I had to either rewatch or pause specific scenes because I was in awe of the detail. This show was an artistic masterpiece.\n\nHonestly i dont get the drama, it was worth every penny, they probably will make their money back on skins easily too.\n\nPeople are not mentioning enough that this $250 million number includes the marketing budget, not just the production. But even with the marketing budget included it’s STILL cheaper than most pixar or disney animations made today, so creating the show way more cost efficient than you’d think. Arcane getting this popular also funnels a ton of people into playing the game, whether it’s new players or returning players, which is a huge return on investment.\n\nAs others have correctly pointed out, Arcane was still cheaper per minute compared to studios like Pixar etc. It was possible cause the money went to people actually making the fucking thing and who gave a damn about the product instead of Execs living in their ivory towers.\n\nArcane has just set the bar too damn high and nothing ever is going to come out of these studios that is ever going to hold a candle to something like Arcane. \n\nI just hope Riot doesn't mess it up and continue being awesome instead of becoming what they swore they wouldn't become.\n\n[deleted]\n\nArcane is a masterpiece and it's special, the way special is defined is by being rare. Nothing is special if there's ton of it every other day. You know what's not special and costs way more than $250million? Marvel universe garbage. No need to explain, the result speaks for itself.\n\nAnyone who dares complain about 2 seasons and 18 episodes worth of a leading edge animation show does not deserve to appreciate it's masterpiece.\n\nWell, they had to prepare two cuts of the same movie, one with lesbians and one without.\n\nSo somebody is complaining that 250 mil is too much? Really? \n\nJust my two cents on the topic: \n\n* Recently, a banana taped to the wall was sold for 5 mil\n* Star Citizen has reached 750 mil with no end in sight. \n* A bunch of shitty movies had a budget higher than that, which is even more horrible when you take into account that they have a 2-hour runtime. Example: Fast and Furious 10 - 340 mil. \n* Arcane is a masterpiece! On every aspect, it is a goddamn masterwork. Animation. Character development. World building. Emotional moments. Artwork... you name it. I hope that this studio makes further series and movies, because they put the whole entertainment industry to shame.\n\nThe animation is some of the best ever. Phenomenal. The character arcs and performances top notch. Story was pretty good too, but the second season felt like it should have been at least 2 seasons.\n\nIf they ever make a single player game based on Arcane I will buy day one.\n\nIf only the game was as good as the show...\n\nNobody is complaining, it's the hollywood dogs that churn out the same cookie cutter movies ft.The Rock with overpriced production and little actual substance that are getting mad that Arcane is stepping up the standards for movies (Along with BG3 and its effect on the whole gaming community)\n\nWasn't The Flash (2023) nearing a $300 million budget? Like the top comment says, they had 9 episodes, each 40 minutes long with a far higher quality than some movies that get released with huge budgets. Like they got them beat on quantity and quality with a similar budget lol."

It takes only a moment of stillness for your consciousness to drown in terror at the rising tide.\n\nI heard the narrator's voice from Disco Elysium when I read this 🤣\n\n&gt;*The dread of real life slowly overflows from the subconscious. It takes only a moment of stillness for your consciousness to drown in terror at the rising tide.*\n\n&gt;SHIVERS [Hard: Success] - There, far off somewhere beyond the pale echoes the sound of a thousand thousand sighs, fears and doubts as common as footsteps on concrete, and innumerable souls sat atop of a toilet with a phone in hand - unable to bare even a moment without distraction.\n\n&gt;DRAMA - Forsooth, such turbulent times doth wreak havoc upon a mind not kept stilled or sedated!\n\n&gt;ELECTROCHEMISTRY [Easy: Success] - See? That's your problem, you just *more* distraction. More sedation. Or both. Preferably at the same time.\n\nI am a gay communist apocalypse cop. Reality does not scare me, reality fears me\n\nyou are, however, profoundly divorced.\n\nThe world’s second most divorced man. \n\nElon Musk being the first.\n\nI left for the case partially dressed, almost licked some old booze off a table, and then a mean child made fun of me. Hit too close to home\n\nHeyyyy, how does everyone know I’m on the toilet for these kinds of posts 😭\n\nI've failed this check myself as I was reading this on my phone in the toilet.\n\nDarkest Dungeon\n\nBastion\n\nI literally read the post before the narrators comment in the 3 narrator's voice mentioned lol\n\nSuch a good game!! I should go back and give it another play through, this time on my steam deck\n\nSame! I actually had to check to make sure I wasn't in the Disco Elysium sub\n\nCould random internet ppl pls stop describing that stuff so perfectly when I'm trying to escape it ?\n\nThat's been my brain for the past few days. An absolute floodwave of real life has come over me and I feel debilitated. Should probably go see a therapist or start practicing mindfulness meditation like my last therapist told me.\n\nFace your fears.\n\nThe only way to calm that tide is to embrace it and learn how it works. It takes time but it’s worth it. \n\nYeah. That dread is a trick of the mind, pushing you deeper into isolation because the world is so scary...and it stays scary because you have no experience or knowledge of it, so who knows what could be lurking out there! Better stay inside, just in case. And the loop closes.\n\nAt this point just leave society for somewhere remote and beautiful\n\nAs if it's as simple as \"Just leave the house and come back later\".\n\nThat ain't gonna work out for you, you simply switch modern society's troubles for the troubles of survival.\n\nThe troubles of survival will be a lot shorter for most people in this thread (myself included, lmao)\n\nThis is a lot easier in third world countries where there’s a bunch of small villages. And if you are born there you probably have relatives in one of them. I lived in one for a while with an aunt it was chill af, just super inconvenient. Had to pump water from the well and scoop poop out of the toilet.\n\nDid\n\nIs the dread gone?\n\nNegative\n\n[deleted]\n\nSo it’s misery in every direction 😞\n\nYou know what i think people like to say this and make it all about depression just because that's easy to say. Not that that doesn't affect people.\n\n\nI just think there's a lot of kids now who are literally afraid to think critically, or do not even know how to. And that in turns create anxiety in even performing that basic action.\n\nThis has always existed. Ffs, before blizzard cracked down on addons in vanilla wow there were literally ports of bejeweled and shit like that that people would play while raiding.\n\nFriends and I would put each other other on follow and play 1.6 scrims for trash too\n\nThe Peggle one still works\n\nHell yeah. Haven’t played wow in years but good to know!\n\nThose were great for long flights or breaks during raiding.\n\nEverquest, /gems\n\nI gotta sit on my ass for ten minutes staring at my spellbook between each quad kite, you better believe I'm playing something else.\n\nThat's the old-school thrilling gameplay I remember.\n\nMy time soloing in Cobalt Scar is how I first read all of Lord of the Rings.\n\nYou are mighty brave. I would be busy quad-kiting othimir until my parents call and knock me off my dial-up AOL. I would get so damn mad lol.\n\nIs that what we're calling ADD nowadays?\n\nADD is no longer a thing as it was just part of the ADHD spectrum.  But yeah, we shouldn't be saying someone with no attention span has tiktok brain.  I'm ADHD and I can't really do silence and tend to dual or tri screen.\n\nTiktok brain is an insult to people with ADHD everywhere.\n\nAlso, while I'm here: get off your phone, people, and read a book. It's better for you.\n\nIsn't it the opposite? Doesn't it help distinguish the people with a medical condition (ADHD) from those with attention issues due to living practices?\n\nno because people assume theyre one and the same. A significant amount of people already dont believe ADHD is a real disability and think its either a justification for laziness or big pharma selling stimulants. \"You dont have adhd, its just that tik tok crap rotting your brain!! get off tiktok and youll be fine!!\".\n\nAs a person with ADHD that doesn't use TikTok: *confused noises*\n\nI guess I kinda understand but still a little confused. I know that you have to fight that stereotype and that it's very difficult and frustrating for you. I'm dealing with some heavy chronic illness issues and dealing with similar lacks of understanding. It just seems like making the distinction between people that lack attention b/c they're on tiktok all day, that only require changing their habits to improve their focus vs. people that have a medical condition that requires medication to improve their focus.\n\nThey're mostly right. A lot of my friend group are psychiatrists (research and clinical practice) and they're sick of the amount of adult diagnoses of ADHD being given now by greedy doctors who know they can milk people with private insurance who want legal amphetamines.\n\nADHD is a real illness and it's serious enough that in an overwhelming majority of cases it will be problematic enough to get diagnosed as a child. Usually it's only patients who had very troubled childhood with inattentive/uncaring/absent parents and teachers/schooling who are genuinely ADHD patients who avoided diagnosis. And if you were not diagnosed or treated it's a real difficulty. People struggle with being able to complete their education because studying and exams are made more difficult by the symptoms, and they struggle to find and maintain steady employment for the same reason. The disease genuinely negatively impacts patients severely.\n\n\nBut most adult diagnoses with private psychiatrists are just people who want the drugs, or who just find that they have a short attention span sometimes and can't read books anymore or watch a movie without going on their phone... They're able to function fine and have jobs and no real impact on their lives. \n\nThe thing is the \"tests\" for ADHD are often based on questions... And the answers are obvious. A doctor won't accuse you of lying, or ask trick questions. Nor do they usually contact the people in your life to find out their perspective on your behaviours (spouses/friends/parents/etc.) like psychiatrists do for child patients.\n\nSorry for rant but we were talking about this for hours at a recent dinner party. 😂\n\n&gt;The thing is the \"tests\" for ADHD are often based on questions... And the answers are obvious\n\nThat wasn't my experience at all. Yes, there were questions, but there was also a whole bunch of cognitive tests (i.e. they read a series of 5 sets of numbers, then ask what was the first one, or they read off a huge list of words and then make you pick all the ones that were in that list from a separate list, etc). Also, you make a lot of, frankly, insulting generalizations in your comment.\n\n&gt;Also, while I'm here: get off your phone, people, and read a book. It's better for you. \n\nThey make phones with two screens now.\n\nBut I have ADHD and haven't been able to finish a book since college. Start them sure, but finish? Not so much. At this point that's more depressing than just not starting one in the first place.\n\nAnd if you don't have time to read as much as you used to, listen to an audiobook. iirc it will stimulate the same areas of the brain as reading would.\n\nI still read, but my Audible account is thicc\n\nJokes on you, I read all my books on my phone. \n\nI don’t have ADD but I do have a lot of anxiety so I find that watching tv and being on reddit and also maybe having some third sort of screen prevents even just one single thought from occurring which is nice.\n\nI am always playing and watching someone play or playing two things. Always have been. I'm 35. Internet wasn't even a component in my early gaming.\n\n\nI was top ranked in starcraft back in 2004, but that wouldn't stop me from tabbing out mid game to keep my wow grind going once wow was out.\n\n\nPeople fail to accept that we have ALWAYS been multitasking, but that multitasking was about being aware of predators. We don't need to always be looking for predators anymore, so some people have become capable of utilizing that compartmentalization of thought to simply enjoy two things at once.\n\n\nAnd the reason it feels bad when you do it, is because now your subconscious is aware that you aren't checking for predators.\n\n\nOf course I'm just some guy, not a psychologist; but I'd bet money we have discoveries in this vein coming soon.\n\nMy experience has been pretty similar but I’ve never actually thought about it the way you’ve articulated it. Seems like a plausible enough explanation. \n\nI wonder if the “feel bad” aspect of it is the Fight or Flight part of the brain realizing it’s been distracted and overcompensating momentarily once it realizes it essentially let it’s guard down.\n\nWhy though? Neither is an idle game. Both demand your full visual attention surely? I could understand playing Isaac with music or a podcast or something but BG3?\n\nPlaying Baldur 3 with a friend and he takes his time playing his turn, managing inventory etc.\n\n&gt; Playing Baldur 3 with a friend and he takes his time playing his turn\n\nproceeds to standard attack the nearest enemy\n\n“How about … eldritch blast?”  \n\n“Daring today aren’t we?”\n\nWarlocks have other abilities?\n\nI find Hunger of Hadar to be a very effective crowd control spell. But yeah, 95% of the time I'm Eldritch Blasting.\n\nUhhh Eldritch Smite?\n\nI once made a warlock without eldritch blast\n\nHow long did you last before respeccing or restarting?\n\n5 minutes because the other players forced me to take it.\n\nI don't often feel personally victimized by a Reddit comment not directed at me, but when I do...\n\nYou cast hellish rebuke?\n\nYou wanna attack this guy back?  \n\n\"Fuck yeah you know I always do\"\n\n*miss*\n\nWell, I have an extra attack\n\n*miss*\n\nWell, that was a great 3 seconds nothing burger, next!\n\nthis beautifully sums up my warlock dnd sessions\n\nBruh me and my girl ended up crying laughing because I would act like I was planning something else or doing something intricate and up Eldritch blasting everything. \n\nThat shit is so op\n\nHey, that's me and sorry I just suck at these but loved em all the same\n\n\"BG3 is an RTS. You have to strategize in real time how to stop me from fucking shit up.\"\n\nThis was me during Divinity 2 playthrough with friends\n\nTwice, standard attack twice\n\nWhy did you do that?\n\nI panicked.\n\nI think you nailed it. Played plenty of multiplayer campaigns since beta and a full team of actual players combat can take long ass time. Someone always seems to be in the bathroom\n\nMy group of friends would have beat BG3 if it wasn’t for one of them always taking their time.\n\nBut oh- when they’re ready u also better be ready because now they have nothing to do but tell you to hurry.\n\nFair enough! Makes sense :)\n\nMy god, Baldur 3 really is just like dnd\n\nSo much so that I have been stuck at character creation for 2 months.\n\nAt first I was like wtf...til I saw BG3 behind the Isaac window lol....totally understand.  Playing with a group of 3 other people or sometimes even just a single friend means I wind up tabbing out and sitting on reddit for like 5 or 6 minutes, sometimes even longer at a times.\n\nJesus, what difficulty? 2 friends and I have been playing through once a week for the last few months, and my buddies and I rarely take very long for our turns. We are only playing balanced though.\n\nPretty sure every run I've done so far has just been the default difficulty.  I play with a bunch people who overthink every single scenario and go back on what their goal was by the time their turn comes around.  Was the same story in Divinity 2 as well lol.  Honestly out of probably 30 different playthroughs on those games  only beat Divinity 2 ONCE with a friend because of so many incomplete playthroughs where people would slowly just not be in the mood to play because of how long it took to get through areas with waiting on one another.  Didn't help like two of my friends were also running summons so we'd not only wait on their turn but their minions as well.\n\nI finished one of the official intro DnD campaigns solo with a tabletop simulator (no role-playing ofc, mostly just the combat). I heard about the constant struggle in real DnD with players with decision paralysis and mulling over every single action. As someone who played all the Baldur's Gate and Neverwinter Nights games and whatever other popular party CRPG you can think of, you can give me control of 6+ player characters and I can do combat efficiently quick on autopilot\n\nThe biggest reason D&amp;D ends up taking so long is that those people who get bored are never paying attention so they always take forever to figure out what to do. Playing with a group of people who know what they are doing and pay attention and you can watch the turns fly by.\n\nI learned that the  standard approach will pretty much work for most encounters in the TT, too\n\nthrow obligatory fireball\n\nactivate barbarian rage and auto-attack\n\npaladin phases in on fairy horse and starts smiting/toppling, with the new edition \n\nand then you can get a little more creative with the support bard/druid/cleric and whatever else you brought\n\nI've done/beaten 4 player hardcore tactician runs of divinity OS 2 which is similarish combat pace, I always paid attention throughout the whole combat incase I had some idea but it could sometimes be 2-3 minutes on a turn if it was dangerous and we needed to plan something out. 5-6 seems a bit ridiculous though.\n\nI'm playing through BG3 for the first time as a duo run with my brother, and I do spend a lot of time tabbed out reading reddit. It's on the default difficulty, but he's particular about inventory management so I end up sitting around a lot.\n\ni play full stack as well but i never tab out. the reason is most of the most interesting things happen when its not your turn. \n\nfriend didnt kill with a barrel. luckily one of them landed next to him. picked him up and threw  him and killed the enemy PLUS the one who was thrown. u dont get that kind of stuff by alt tabbing. \n\nand its not like u have to sit there, u can talk to others. mess around with your inventory. \n\npersonally i kept throwing skulls and random shit into my friends bags while i had down time\n\nWe usually discuss what the best course of action is as a team instead of just individually letting my buddy try to make the best move by himself, incentives teamwork and also helps others make their move faster since there is a clear optimal move in mind.\n\nDude. I totally get it. I played with a buddy and I'd sit there for like 5 minutes while he strategized and then he'd use eldritch blast like he does every other time.\n\ni hate when people are like this.  just be engaged...\n\ni hate when my friends go on their phone while playing magic.\n\nI played HoMM III with my friend back in ~2000. In the game, units become available at the start of every week and you get gold every turn. So at some point you get more guys to buy than you have gold. So.. each turn, my friend goes through all his cities and dwellings and buys everything. \"Ok, from this city I can only buy one dragon, not two. Then I have enough gold to buy couple second best units and then couple third best units and several smaller units\". Every turn. Every... turn.\n\nThen I play my turn:  Ok, I don't have battle, I just move my guy here and save all my gold to next turn, end turn.\n\nAnd his buying spree continues.\n\nMan I wouldnt want to play with someone that just plays another game. Have fun with your friend.\n\nI mean, BG3 is turn-based. You basically have all the time in the world to do anything.\n\nIdk some large combats feel like it can take 5 minutes before the AI finally decides to wrap things up and let the player play the game again.\n\nI can definitely see a rogue lite you can pause at will like Isaac being a good way to spend that 5 minutes.\n\nEven more so if you're playing co-op and it takes 5 minutes for your friend to decide he's just going to cast fireball anyway.\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 absolutely is an idle game when you play with crazy people who min-max the shit out of shopping. \n\nSource: Life\n\nbetter question, why is it overlapped and not on a second monitor\n\nLaptop probably\n\nOriginal Flash Isaac in 2024? Wild.\n\nI always liked this one, the newer ones were too much for my brains after i had learned the original one, its cozy.\n\nPlus all the fun exploits that only exist in the OG flash version.\n\nThere's some fun exploits in OG rebirth. I remember when I had it on my Vita I got the donation machine to 999 on floor one by getting the d20 and portable slot.\n\nCharging brimstone and then spamming the attack button so the laser does more ticks of damage was fun haha\n\nYes! Brimsnapping! Oh man that brings me back.\n\ni always felt like a badass going down to negative red hearts\n\nSoundtrack in og is goated, everything else I'd prefer Repentance\n\nOG soundtrack so good I had to get a mod to replace the tracks\n\nIt have some great things like music, art style.\n\nrs/osrs players have been doing this for over a decade.\n\nOver two decades\n\nI had to sit down after reading that.\n\nI’m incapable of playing a game without osrs up on another monitor. I need help\n\nThere was an older niche multiplayer game that I loved to play with a small group of people, where it was constant action but with a few seconds between inputs. \n\nBetween seconds, he'd alt-tab, start the next bit of acrobatics training, then tab back in to do his next input.

Saw it in a couple of comments but don’t know what you’re talking about.\n\nOldschool runescape \n\nThanks\n\nAre you okay, OP?\n\nBy this point I'm not entirely sure *anyone* is okay. Sure does seem to be an awful lot of people hanging by a thread after the last couple of years.\n\nSame\n\nIm definitely doing the best Ive ever been. So theres hope. You just keep pushing. It takes struggle to appreciate the peace.\n\nPeace? We're on the brink of WW3 with the middle east and Russia and Taiwan. Do you live under a rock? Can I join you there?\n\nI was more referring to peace of mind. Some people just prefer to focus on the things in their immediate life and realize they have no agency towards things that happen on the other side of the planet. I empathize for those who suffer but it really doesnt impact me so why dwell on it.\n\nMy first thought too.  Hope you’re okay OP\n\nMakes me think of my raiding days in World of Warcraft, and the healers had the Bejeweled add-on.\n\nSometimes you will see their score announced even as the raid is fighting.\n\nBro is cooking for no nut November\n\nDamn! I knew I forgot something.\n\nDick already in hand, like \"Oh someone should have said something\" 🤣\n\nYour gonna need 2 monitors my dude\n\nThought this was r/adhdmeme for a sex\n\nSECOND\n\n..and yet it wasn't enough to keep you from thinking of making a social media type post about it.\n\nDire stuff..!\n\nI've done this before. Hiding in PUBG back in the day, might as well get a Clash of Clans attack in. Opponent's turn in Hearthstone? Time to read a novel or two.\n\nHearthstone is a perfect example, poe on monitor 2 farming maps while my opponent ropes on turn 2 and then armors up last second lol\n\nWhich thought is the piece of shit hurting you? whisper it to me and I'll beat the shit out of it for you.\n\nI have severe OCD… literally spent years distracting myself to avoid the thoughts. I know the feeling.\n\nthen how did it occur to you to make this post?\n\nClassic toilet moment\n\nGet that 2nd screen and ur golden bro\n\nIs that flash Isaac?\n\nHey OP wanna talk?\n\nCan't have thoughts, those are bad\n\nGotta get some OSRS going on a second monitor to up that APM\n\nfinal boss of ADHD\n\nYikes, I would hate to play with you lol. Not even the attention span to pay attention to what your friend is doing in game. Just brainrot all day\n\nWhen you can have 5-10 minutes of down time waiting for your turn, you will find something to do to pass that time. Happens in real D&amp;D sessions as well so he is just adding to the authenticity.\n\nyea let me just watch my freind:\n\n- move mouse around seeing where they can move to\n\n- queue ranged attack on enemy. pause thinking\n\n- unqueue ranged attack on enemy. pause thinking\n\n- queue ranged attack/ability on different enemy\n\n- unqeueue said ability. pause thinking\n\n- move character to melee range\n\n- realize they needed to jump and no longer have enough movement and fall short. pause thinking\n\n- queue original ranged attack on original enemy. pause thinking\n\n- miss 2x due to being threatened\n\nor instead of just watching him make all the decisions you can discuss what the best course of action is to win the fight, if your playing from the start you should have a good idea what his kit is, both parties can pass information that the other might not know like enemy weakness, inventory, general positioning, what skills you have up what follow up combo can be done who to focus etc. The team has a clear plan in mind and people make their move faster when they communicate and collaborate.\n\nIf the friend is anything like mine, that will just make the turn take even longer when you give them another option.\n\nor u can talk about other shit. the game is social. it doesnt have to be game related. it could literally be anything.\n\nthe next ufc fight or the previous one, work, events, news of the week. whatever.\n\n[deleted]\n\nMapping in Poe while doing literally anything else hahaha\n\nYes that's the method I use\n\nOhhhh fellow isaac enjoyer\n\nWhen I played WoW, I'd have Isaac running in the background to play during down time in raid lol\n\nYou just lost The Game.\n\nGah this generation. Back in my day you took your old Gameboy Color, Gameboy Advance, and DS to play Pokemon Silver, Ruby and Diamond at the same time while you watched TV like a normal person.\n\nJust occasionally picking one up, then the ad break hits and its fucking go time.\n\n*or combine reddit with gaming for a longer lasting effect*\n\nNothing worse then thoughts\n\nIsaac and his...whatever that other game is\n\ni cant belive someone actually plays flash isaac this days\n\nYep. My ADHD causes me to play a game, watch a YouTube video/show and listen to music.

    "all_comment_text": "Now it's a speedrun category. Great.\n\n[removed]\n\nI hope you like slow walking into a corner for 20 minutes. Slightly joking, I'm glad some people get enjoyment from this. I'm just not one of them.\n\nLike the goldeneye community with looking down to lower (it raises them. Not lowers. Got it backwards) frames. There was a lot of aversion to it at first, but this in Mario 64 seems just like a challenge and gimmick not what’s optimal. [for you absolute legends.](https://youtu.be/FKkhzioZVD0?si=r3ieWGBodZIOkSQU)\n\nFirst off, Karl has come a long way with his video quality. I loved this video when it came out, but he has really improved in (5!!!) years since this video.\n\nSecond, I love this story. Some fucking old guy misinterprets a gaming mag, unintentionally discovers how to reduce lag, and the community doesn't believe him because he comes out of nowhere. It takes weeks for someone to even attempt his stupid method, and when they do immediately 3 world records are broken and half the community quits, lol. WHAT A LEGEND\n\nSpeed running has come so far since those days.\n\n[deleted]\n\nTo be fair, he's being sued (again) by the video game cheater of the century Billy Mitchell. Dude kinda need the money for the drawn out legal battle that will inevitably result in Billy getting the L again.\n\nBillys lawyers would like to know your location to better serve you with a subpoena\n\nFrom what I remember, Notch is supporting him for the legal fees as Notch despises Bitch Mitchell (rightly so)\n\nDid notch ever climb out of his ideological rut or is this a deal with the devil type situation?\n\nHe stopped with the outright Nazi stuff and replaced it with 24/7 incel rhetoric.\n\ndude Sponsor Block is the shit; I didn't need any incentive or thing to set me off; auto-skip ads? I'm _in_\n\nI believe it raises the frame rate, not lower it. There is less on screen to render so the frames go up and James goes faster because of it.\n\n&gt; James \n\nReferring to him by his first name is throwing me so hard\n\nThat must be Miss Moneypenny's account.\n\nJimmy B, licenced to kill\n\nYou’re right I had it backwards.\n\nHeh that's actually a common thing with overlock checking back in the day. I actually was just playing around with this on a middling laptop and trying to see what my FPS should be on CS2. Aiming down is like the baseline max FPS and looking out into the distance is what the GPU will struggle to get.\n\nHope you’re ready for a three hour Summoning Salt video on the history of A-less Super Mario 64 speedruns.\n\nYou mean the 5h 22 minute video by Bismuth that doesn't even have the latest stuff included?\n\nI love him, but as the videos get longer and longer I watch less and less. I like the history and in depth nature, but it gets to a point where it’s too much\n\nI had the same feeling for a lot of his more recent videos but the Tetris one was incredible. I couldn’t turn it off\n\n[deleted]\n\nIdk how many people noticed, but the last almost half of the video was just the past 6 months.  Tetris has turned CRAZY lately.  \n\nI expected it to not get clicks honestly cause yeah, it’s *tetris*.  I stumbled onto what was happening sometime around last summer and had 0 issues believing that video was 2 hours haha\n\nWas about to reply the same thing. Haven't finished most of the recent ones but the Tetris vid is probably his best, 10/10\n\nYeah long form has its place. I love Jenny Nicholson and Defunctland because they both approach amusement parks from interesting angles and you don’t feel like you have to watch all at once. Jenny just did a 4 hour video on the failed Disney Star Wars hotel and it’s a fantastic video, I wouldn’t cut even 20 min from it. It’s also structured in a way (with 20 sections) that you can just watch some sections at one time and come back later. I probably watched the whole video over 4 days.\n\nI also love MoistCritikal’s YouTube videos over his streams because he takes a topic and condenses it down to like 8-14 min. For 90% of his videos if they were twice that length I would never watch.\n\nI’m sure he’ll find his sweet spot, but I agree recently the longer form ones haven’t been working for me.\n\nI don’t understand the trend of super long YouTube videos. There are some now that are over 10 hours longs breaking down every episode of a series and it somehow has millions of views. Who are these people watching a 12 hour breakdown of a series that only had ten hours of content?\n\nYou typically don't watch it all in one go, but in pieces over several days whenever you have a longer stretch of time to kill. Making it all one video is more convenient to watch than episodes, and it also helps engagement as all the views and comments are collected on the single video.\n\n[deleted]\n\nOr it's background noice (my case)\n\nIt's been shown that a single episode of something, despite its length, will do better than a long series of videos. I'm referring to YT specifically, I don't know about elsewhere.\n\nI just heard the Summoning Salt intro in my head\n\nNah this is 100% more in pannenkoek's territory\n\nIt's criminal that the article does not mention Pannenkoek a single time.\n\nYeah this was like a knee jerk reaction to not wanting to miscredit someone. Pannen predominantly does tas stuff, but he absolutely did help with a lot of the rta setups for the run. Tbh the article itself almost feels AI generated, and even quotes a copyright trap from ukikipedia.\n\n86h sounds more like slowrunning than speedrunning\n\nThe problem is that one of the mandatory techniques in order to avoid pressing A in one of the mandatory levels takes [literally three days.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aa_CciaM4aM)\n\nSeven eighths of the run is spent waiting for this one platform to rounding-error its way high enough that you can skip pressing A to jump off a pole. **There is no known faster method (that does not require pressing A, defeating the whole purpose).**\n\nImagine being a few pixels off and having to wait another week\n\nJust wait until you try the ‘All Achievements’ The Stanley Parable speed run.\n\nI didn’t go outside, but I did uninstall it so I couldn’t accidentally open it and reset the timer.\n\nIt only takes 10 years!\n\nwait until you hear about lowest% category. instead of speedrunning a game to 100% completion, the speedrun is done with the lowest possible things done to beat the game. If you beat the game in 5h with 2 items, someone who beat the game in 50h with 1 item beats your time.\n\nIt's been a category for years...\n\nI knew about the 1/2 A press because of that one video but this is unexpected\n\nMan, that video was a ride. A ridiculously niche topic, completely pointless, yet utterly captivating.\n\nThe same guy has a new one out, an absolute magnum opus that clearly took a very long time to research and present. Basically a PhD thesis on Mario 64's hidden walls.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/YsXCVsDFiXA\n\ndescribing the mechanics of the invisible walls and then cutting to examples of speedrunners getting murdered by that specific wall is so fucking funny, it's like a nature documentary\n\nThe snowman's land instakill is the best thing I've ever seen\n\nHelp, I’m stuck in a 4 hour long video on a topic that I didn’t know existed and had no interest in, but it’s so weirdly captivating.\n\nYou're probably just running into the boundary and it is cancelling your horizontal movement.\n\nI've been slowly making my way through one on a Disney hotel that doesn't exist anymore.  I'm not sure why exactly.\n\nAnother great video about doors in SM64\n\nhttps://youtu.be/EmqFoojMeD8?feature=shared\n\nfuckin 4 hours.. wow\n\nI just watch this last night, and I get you not it was worth the 4 hours\n\nAbout 15 minutes in, and my wife does not like it lol\n\nnow let's look at it from above\n\nOhh my god it’s 4 hours\n\nOnly 2 hours if you watch it at 2x speed. With the time saved you can rewatch the parallel universe video\n\nOk TJ *Henry* Yoshi, hear me out\n\nFun fact: The star in that original video now takes about six minutes with zero a presses.\n\nYeah IIRC there are currently 19 A presses required to get every star, but you only need 70 stars to beat the game\n\nedit: ok actually it's 14: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_IEhqUAuCY\n\nIt's 13: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAwienu67cU\n\nWhat video?\n\nOne of the best of all time: https://youtu.be/kpk2tdsPh0A\n\nThat video feels like a kid making a trip to the store only to get caught up in an interstellar war and save the universe.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpk2tdsPh0A\n\nNote that this run is outdated, however the video is still an amazing deep dive into the inner workings and glitches of Super Mario 64.\n\n1/2 A press? An A press is an A press. You can't say it's only half.\n\nOk TJ \"Henry\" Yoshi\n\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"Henry\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\n\nEach A press is actually made up of three parts...\n\n[deleted]\n\nWell if it's three parts, you still can't have half an A press, you can only have 1/3 or 2/3.\n\nwhat if one part is bigger than the other 2 parts\n\nWhy does the largest A part, not simply eat the other smaller A parts?\n\nYou can cut a circle into 3 parts and not have them be equal.\n\nQuiet TJ Henry Yoshi.\n\nIt's like Mormon soaking\n\n&gt;The Super Mario 64 A Button Challenge (ABC for short) has an incredibly complicated history going all the way back to the early 2000s, a few years after the game's 1996 release. **I was only made aware of this particular challenge this morning and don't have nearly enough time to go over everything**, but you can watch this [five-hour explanation video from Bismuth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXbJe-rUNP8) if you want.\n\nNow that's some quality journalism. Couldn't even ask chatgpt for a summary\n\npaint friendly rainstorm disagreeable merciful lush practice whistle include serious\n\nSuper Mario 64 is a game about jumping. The goal of the challenge is to beat it without jumping.\n\n\"Each trick mario does to avoid pressing the A button deteriorates the universe further, for we are mere peons living in his parallel universes\"\n\nfertile chase abundant alleged glorious ad hoc sophisticated books jellyfish pocket\n\nGame changing even.\n\nBasically, almost 20 years ago, someone posted a challenge to a prominent SM64 fan page to beat the game pressing the A button (the jump button) as few times as possible.\n\nAnd ever since then, people have been literally tearing the game to shreds trying to beat that challenge, everything from memory corruption to parallel universes.\n\nHonestly I kind of respect him for saying he doesn’t know enough and says go to this guy instead.\n\nExactly, at least they were honest. That has to be slightly better than writing guesses or nonsense about the challenge.\n\nTJ Henry yoshi in shambles\n\nNah, there's no half A press in the run. TJ \"\"\"\"\"\"Henry\"\"\"\"\"\" Yoshi is pleased.\n\nSo that dude is actually really chill and nice. He comments on most of Pannenkoek's videos with very heartfelt and encouraging words.\n\nPlease, this is easy... just use a Playstation controller.\n\nI was going to say, they just remapped their controller but are really, really bad at the game.\n\nOr Sharpie. \n\nGuess I'm going to need to see the video. I'm not sure how you'd even enter a level without the A button. Or open a door. And maybe the title screens are timed but thought you need to hit it to start the level too.\n\nThe article doesn’t explain any of that. It doesn’t explain how they were able to get over obstacles or really anything else. Lots of fluff, very little info.\n\nIt _very_ heavily reeks of chatGPT generation.\n\nBismuth has great videos on it on YouTube. The history of the challenge is fascinating. The early days were simple glitch hunting and optimization. By the end, they'd essentially deconstructed the entire engine to understand how everything functions, and have spent thousands of hours of computational time brute forcing possible combinations of inputs to find ways through challenging sections. Tick tock clock is especially interesting. The full series is over 5 hours, but if you have a passing interest in computer science and game design, it's well worth the time. \n\nThe history of the challenge is a 5 hour video god damn. I was curious about it, but not that curious. Always fascinates me when people make so detailed videos about very niche themes.\n\nTime to speedrun watching the history of this speedrun.\n\n[deleted]\n\n[deleted]\n\nJust add ?t=4h59m59s to the url\n\nHe also first released it spilt into multiple videos, that might be a bit more approachable: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL94lfiY18_CgWGQzweD_aVjsFXiRi6kn5\n\nThanks, it is indeed way more approachable, I will give that first video a watch.\n\nThat’s literally the best part about the internet, and truly highlights how it *can* be a magical, wonderful place.\n\nFinding a community of people hyperfixated on a thing that you yourself are also hyperfixated on. It’s amazing to find your people.\n\nJust wait for the summoning salt video\n\nAnd on July 14, 2017, Matt Turk achieved this run;\n\nHappy Gilmore achieved this feat no more than an hour ago.\n\n&gt;Guess I'm going to need to see the video\n\n&gt; 86 hours\n\nReport back to us in 2 weeks and let us know lol\n\n78 of those hours is just sitting and waiting.\n\nIt's actually only 8 hours of watching, a bit too short in my opinion. &lt;/DoorInTheFaceTechnique&gt;\n\nCan’t wait for the Summoning Salt video breakdown on this one. “And that’s when ShitballsMcGee… finally broke the record”\n\nsadly i can’t take credit for this but i appreciate the support\n\nI was like \"hah, someone made this account just to reply to this\". Nope. 11 year old account, first post in 7 years.\n\nDude had to dig up his account password from when he wrote it down in a middle school notebook.\n\nMaybe Scumrat_Higgins is ShitballsMcGee's new account? Only 17 days old? Queue XFiles music.\n\n/r/beetlejuicing\n\nwhat the fuck\n\nHoly shit the legend himself appears before us\n\nLmfao\n\nEDIT: LMAO first comment in 7 years\n\nLiterally your first comment in 7 years lol\n\nWe're not worthy\n\nWell if you got five hours, [here is a Bismuth video on most of it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXbJe-rUNP8)\n\n[removed]\n\nThese are words that made a sentence in what appears to be English but I can't seem to understand it\n\nstep 1: play the game as 'normal', prepping certain glitches. All buttons may be used.\n\nStep 2: leave the level\n\nStep 3: restart the level, but this time do not use the A button. Instead, use the glitches you had prepped in step 1.\n\nSo.... it was not beaten without pressing A?\n\nIt was indeed a different achievement than insinuated by the title\n\n&gt;insinuated\n\nFlat-out stated\n\nOutright *implied!*\n\n[deleted]\n\nIt was beaten without pressing A because this \"Step 1\" where any buttons can be used is not true. All setups were done without pressing A. This has been the precedent of the A Button Challenge for years\n\nIt depends on what you utilize as a timeframe.\n\nIf you count all setup and prep for the level, then yes, the A button was pressed to achieve it.\n\nIf you only count each individual run of a level, then on the final \"successful\" run of the level, the A button was not used, but that's only because it was used in a previous run.\n\nIt's like saying \"Man goes 1 to max in World of Warcraft without looting a single enemy!\" and then omitting the fact that he had to spend 80 hours on a different max level character farming gear to funnel to the new character so that he didn't have to worry about looting gear.\n\n[deleted]\n\nThe setup did not require the A button. There are some levels that need to be setup by entering a different level first, but you can do that without the A button\n\nboth things are bullshit \n\nif you don't play it from?start to  finish without exiting the game  and without hitting the a button then you didn't finish it without hitting the a button\n\nThat is incorrect. None of the glitches used require the A button, not even for preparation\n\nSounds like a lot of work, just remap A to a different button and play the game normally.\n\n\nEZ.\n\n[deleted]\n\nThat's hilarious. As someone with gaming experience but not with tekken specifically, I can make general sense of it. But it must be a trip from Kings perspective without any gaming knowledge (I assume). Being an expert in language then getting hit with hyper specific jargon and being totally lost lol\n\nOh you know King is on CoD every night pwning 12-year-olds while laughing hard like Tim Curry into the microphone\n\nIf you think thats bad wait until we talk about parallel universes\n\nYou're literally just wrong about this. Or worse, lying. Timing starts from console reset and uses a fresh file, and A was never used once.\n\nFor other people- this is the guy who did the run lol\n\nOmg it's you, the person from the article! I'm a big fan!!!\n\n(We're friends and I'm just poking fun)\n\nThis is straight up misinfo btw, if you know anything about anything in the run you know that everything has been done 0x rta both in this run and as an IL\n\nThis comment is either a huge misunderstanding or an outright lie. Marbler simply didn't do this. He did not use the A button once. Maybe you saw the rollout from dives and thought it used the A button, but that uses the B button. How is this the most liked comment on this post, it's blatant misinformation \n\nWhat are you talking about? This was a full game run with no A button presses used whatsoever. \n\nYou can't \"prepare a level\" by cloning things in advance; cloned objects are unloaded when you exit the level. It's possible to set up a HOLP for cloning in advance, but in the A Button Challenge that it always done without an A press. For example, for the Mario Wings to the Sky star, the TAS 0xA strategy is to build a Goomba Staircase to place the HOLP in a specific spot in the sky without pressing A. Then the level is re-entered, the HOLP used to create a Goomba Oasis, and another Staircase built to it. All without a single A press.\n\n[removed]\n\nif you still played the level using the button to \"prepare\" the level, whatever *that* means, doesnt that mean then they did not, in fact, get the achievement?\n\nthedid get the achivement, there was no preparation, this was a full run, beaten from the start to the finish, with no a presses\n\nFrom a laymans view yeah. But there has been precedent for this and is generally agreed that this is a \"No A Press\" run despite the fact they do need to press A\n\nThis is literally false. An A press used to set up a strategy is still an A press used. The A button was not used at all in this run.\n\nthere has been 0 precedent for this, and theres none to be needed, since this didnt require preparation at all, this was a full 0 a press run\n\nTell me you didn't watch the run without telling me you didn't watch the run\n\nThe A button was unused from game start all the way to grabbing the star after defeating the final boss. Simple as that. End of story. Period.\n\nThis comment is completely false. Everything in this run, including all of the setups, was done without using the A button.\n\nThe run started from a console power-on with an empty file. No glitch or setup in SM64 persists through a console reset. The A button was not used in any of the setups performed in this run.\n\nMarbler did not use the A button. I don't even know what made you claim that.\n\nThe player in question has not used the jump button at all. Any and all set-ups for any glitches were done without pressing A. This has been the precedent for the ABC for a decade, and was done by a member of the community who has done many contributions of his own in both TAS ABC (where you use TASes) and RTA ABC (where you play the game in real time, like what he did here)\n\nThere is an A press counter on the live stream. It stays zero for the whole entire 86 hours.\n\nThe A button was unbounded to make sure it will never ever be pressed\n\nThe run starts from the very beginning, and no A presses are supposed to be used after that ever.\n\nThere are strategies in YouTube of each star being done with no A presses, made by many talented people.\n\nThis comment is blatant misinformation, and discredits an honest achievement done by an incredibly talented person. If you respect the achievements of others, please admit that this statement is false.\n\nIt's an utter disgrace that this comment is gaining upvotes\n\nI remember there was an hour long video about a half button press for Mario 64. It's all so wild to think about.\n\nWatch out for rolling rocks is the greatest video game video of all time.\n\n\nIt was long by old YouTube standards. Like 25 minutes. Compared to the ridiculous 5 hour video essays people are into now, quite short. \n\nWell, Pannenkoek did also recently release an almost 4 hour video about invisible walls in the game (and is probably the highest in-game production I've ever seen of any game)\n\nThis isn't true.\n\nThere are some individual stars in SM64 that require an A-button press (though to my knowledge none of them require an A-press in the \"setup\" phase aside from TTC or Rainbow Ride entry, so I'm not even sure what you're referencing) but a 70 star run (which is what this video is) can just skip the stars that cannot be acquired without the A button.\n\nIn the original SM64 on N64 hardware this lowers the total A press count to 1 (because there's still no known way to skip the A-press in Bowser in the Fire Sea on console) but on WiiVC (which is where this run was performed) that last press is skippable, lowering the count to 0.\n\nI'd like to request that you edit this. I don't know where you heard it, but it's not true at all. Marbler never pressed the A button, and now thousands of people think this genuine achievement is partly faked because of this comment.\n\nYou're thinking of a previous video. Marbler successfully completed the entire *game* (not a specific level) in zero A presses, in real time. On the Wii VC, obviously.\n\nIt DOES take away from it because wtf does any of this mean??\n\nwhat yemesis is trying to say is that the level required set up to beat, what yemesis is wrong about is everything, there was 0 set up, this was from console power on\n\n[deleted]\n\nOne of the best youtube channels out there.\n\nHis DK64 TAS explained video is one of the greatest pieces of entertainment ever made.\n\nSummoning Salt\n\nBismuth\n\nAbyssoft\n\nLowest Percent\n\nThis kings of speed running lore.\n\nAnd Pannenkoek too, he just did a video of invisible walls recently\n\nHow many parallel universes did this take?\n\n0, actually. It's an RTA run, not tool assisted, so while it's not *technically impossible* to access parallel universes RTA, they're difficult to access, and nearly impossible to then return after going there.\n\n\"For the first time in 28 years\"\n\nLinks to a video from a year ago.\n\nTop quality journalism there.\n\nAlso the person straigh up admits in the article that they aren't informed, links to a 5 hour youtube video they say you should watch for context and fundamentally mischaracterize how the run works. The achievement is rad, this article is shit.\n\nAlso if you've been following the progress of the A Button Challenge then just finishing the game without pressing A isn't the whole story. They can collect all 120 Stars with just 12 A Presses and I think they can collect around 110 with a single A Press. I may have gotten those counts wrong because some tricks are only possible on specific versions of the game and they don't all overlap but it's something close to that count.\n\nAlso \"First time in 28 years\" implies somebody did it 28 years ago right?\n\n&gt; Wii VC version\n\nThis has been a known thing for a while. The A button challenge is gonna keep going until they can get the original N64 Japanese version down to 0x A presses.\n\n&gt;As Ukikipedia lays out, this was accomplished thanks to the decades-spanning foundation of A-press save discoveries accumulated by the speedrunning community. Ukikipedia gives special mentions to \"Mr_Robert_Z, Bottles704, Thiago Trujillo, Mp16z, and most notably, bobmario511, who uploaded numerous videos in his channel dedicated to the A Button Challenge.\"\n\nSounds like it took a lot more time and people than the usual speedruns in games\n\nit is fucking WILD that Pannenkoek isn't mentioned once in that article\n\nyeah even though his work is primarily in TAS, i'm sure there must be some carryover to RTA strats\n\nPannen and marbler worked together a lot to create RTA setups, but since sharing credit for things doesn't exist in the gaming journalism world, all of it goes to marbler for some reaosn\n\nI'm the person who wrote that in the Ukikipedia article. The people listed here are completely misattributed. They only contributed to the early A Button Challenge, and that was the context of the original text. Pannenkoek2012 isn't even mentioned anywhere in the article. These people aren't relevant to modern ABC, let alone RTABC. There are actual people there who helped contribute to this amazing achievement that gets scrubbed over because of some sloppy journalism, so their credits are completely misattributed and nonexistent here\n\nThis was like... GameFAQs era, like pre-2010s, right?\n\nFunniest journalism mistake ever, honestly.\n\nYes!\n\nLmfao, as probably the guy that wrote that, that is missing a ton of people and is probably old. Bobmario has not been active for a long while, probably 10+ years.\n\nI don't know, this sounds like the usual level of work that goes into building speed runs.\n\nIt was beaten without using the A button 28 years ago?\n\nMan, did I miss it or was there no mention of Pannen?\n\nPannen even helped a lot with this run, so it's actually funny. Most articles drool at the chance to mention Pannen and ignore that the rest of us exists\n\nI could explain how this run is possible, but first I'd need to tell you about parallel universes.\n\nI doubt the run uses PU movement at all. It's real time and PU movement usually requires tool-assisted precision.\n\nTo rebut your argument, I'll need to build up some speed. A LOT of speed.\n\nWhat exactly defined an “A” press? It sounds simple but it is an extremely complicated question. Answered by what I consider the GOAT of all gaming videos. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/kpk2tdsPh0A?si=We_jPiYQs4BXHdcp\n\n\"An A press is an A press, you can't say it's only half\"\n\nWith these words you can start a war\n\nIt's not complicated, it's pressing an A button. This is a full game run, so the notation of a half A press isn't relevant here\n\nSounds like it actually took 28 years\n\nI can't wait for someone to make an analysis of this run. They're pretty nostalgic somehow and they make great content to watch while eating."

You got that?\n\nWas expecting to see an Army Of Darkness reference way higher in this thread, Doom's lore borrows so much from Evil Dead \n\nOriginal doomguy pixel face even reminds a bit of Bruce Campbell lol\n\nThat is a bizarre fucking twist but im in\n\nIt’s addressed in the Doom Eternal lore. Dude’s been ripping and tearing for a loooooong time\n\nPlus it's Doom, the narrative reasoning is irrelevant if the gameplay is tight. I don't play Doom for the plot.\n\nThe plot of Doom is collecting demon scalps. And I WILL get me my scalps.\n\n\"Yo Slayer this demon wants to die for hell. Oblige him\"\n\nDoom-anic-a DiCoco\n\nGore-lammy.\n\nAntonio MargaRIPANDTEARi.\n\n🤌\n\nBawnjorno\n\nA river derci\n\nAreeev-a-deer-chie.\n\nIt’s quite funny how deep the lore goes. I dgaf about it but I like the fact it’s there for the purists. \n\nIt’s like all the books skimmed through in Skyrim. Listen I’m not reading them but I know there are people having a great time with them.\n\nMore please\n\nThere’s that channel on YouTube with in depth doom lore videos, it’s fantastic stuff. It’s honestly some absolute mythological nonsense cooked up to create doom guy, but it’s also just epic - the tale across time and space, of a soldier’s journey to becoming a God, with no real motivation other than.. *rip and tear*\n\nAvenging his pet rabbit, Daisy\n\nMy favorite original Doomguy lore is that his dad is Commander Keen.\n\nWasn’t BJ from wolfenstein ?\n\nThat's a more distant ancester but they are related.\n\nBJ is Keen's ~~dad~~ grandpa, Keen (William Joseph Blazkowicz aka Billy Blaze) is Doomguy's dad. I love it it's fucking great\n\nedit: not dad, def gramps\n\nSome of the best stories in games are the ones with lore embedded in the world instead of being endlessly shoved in your face with cutscenes.\n\nControl\n\n\"The worst part about fighting in a basement is that you're fighting in a basement... with *me*\" - Doomguy Gorlami\n\n&gt;\tcollecting demon scalps \n\n…and listening to a bomb-ass boss music while doing so.\n\nAnd then use those scalps as ammunition for the new chain gun!\n\nHonestly what I loved was being able to collect the codex and work through the lore and story but it never got in the way of shooting everything in sight\n\nI think they've done a good job building the lore. I suck at the game but play to learn more about doom lore. I just love it.\n\nDoom has a complex plot with a beginning, middle and end. \n\n\nBeginning - Rip\n\n\nMiddle - and\n\n\nEnd -Tear\n\n2016 still has one of my favorite gaming memories. Where I put the controller down to watch the first bit of exposition while my character swiftly shoves it across the room lol. \n\nYeah, but it is still there for a reason.\n\nThe franchise doesn't have a big narrative focus but they're still narrative games, so having a functional lore won't do any bad, even if it's just there to be badass and fulfill the proposal of the game.\n\n(Not that this aspect will be bad in the next game, it didn't even come out yet)\n\nEven the old Doom games had a whole novel series.\n\nWr come for the gameplay, but a cool narrative is a nice bonus.\n\nComic book Doom is still the best novelization effort. &gt;!And as of Doom Eternal's Sentinel Prime chapter, might be canon!&lt;\n\nIt is unnecessary, but I've always appreciated the fact that there is some, even back in the originals. I know I'm in the minority for saying this, but that's one of the reasons why I liked Doom 3 when it came out was because they had stereotypical but effective narrative.\n\nI like Doom plot to be honest. It has some special feeling, I don't know.\n\nThe lore of doom is pretty damn deep though. There's a ton in the game to flesh it out and it's pretty sick\n\n\"I play Doom for the plot.\" - Max0r\n\n&gt; I don't play Doom for the plot.\n\nI get it, but the lore is kind of dope, ngl\n\nStory in video games is like story in porn, it doesn't matter but it's expected to be there. -John Carmack, probably\n\nYup. So after Doom 64, the Doomguy decides to stay in hell due to the constant demon invasions. After an unknown amount of time, he finds his way to Exultia and meets the Night's Sentinels and joins them (we see this in Eternal Flashbacks). Then the Night Sentinel civil war happens, and the Doomslayer's side loses, so he goes back to his endless war against the demons in hell for an unknown amount of time before Doom 2016 starts, then leads to Doom Eternal.\n\nThe demons describe the time periods of the Doomslayer waging his campaigns in hell as \"ages\" and \"eons\".\n\nHow the hell did Doomslayer's side lose? They have a goddamn Doomslayer\n\nWell, first the Doomslayer's side was vastly outnumbered. Half the Night Sentinels, the Makyrs, and the demons formed an alliance against the Slayer's faction.\n\nBut the real reason is the Betrayer, the guy you meet in level 2 of Doom Eternal. He was offered the resurrection of his son if he betrayed the Night Sentinels and helped Argent D'Nur to be swallowed into hell. From there the Slayer's faction was hunted down until the Slayer was the last one, and so he just started killing things in hell.\n\n&gt; Half the Night Sentinels, the Makyrs, and the demons formed an alliance against the Slayer's faction.\n\nWtf? Why though?\n\nIt's been awhile since I read through the codex. But the Night Sentinels were sworn to serve the Makyrs. The Sentinels are also enemies of the demons in hell.\n\nThe Makyrs were secretly working with the demons to consume souls to create Argent energy, which the Makyrs need to survive. When it was discovered that the Makyrs were working with the demons, the Night Sentinels were split. Half stayed true to the vow they made to serve the Makyrs, while the Doomslayer's faction rebelled, broke their oath, and waged a war against the Makyrs/loyalist Sentinels.\n\nAll those ghostly Night Sentinels who hand you Praetor tokens, those are the Night Sentinels who sided with the Slayer. The Mauraders are the loyalist Sentinels who died and went to hell where they were resurrected as Marauders.\n\nThe Slayer's faction was defeated due to the actions of the Betrayer, who sold out Argent D'Nur in return for his son's resurrection. However his son was resurrected within the Icon of Sin, so the Betrayer didn't get what he wanted.\n\nDang... I really want to play the whole series now. Thanks for the explanation!\n\nDoom does the Dark Souls thing of, if you want a great story you have to find it. Start digging. The only thing Doom does better is being straight forward with the lore it gives you. Dark Souls is usually a bit cryptic. \n\nLots of good lore, but you literally have to look for it since some of it is hidden.\n\nYeah, it's pretty good. I think you'll have fun.\n\nAnd people say *i don't play doom for the story*.\n\nBetrayed when they went through the portals, scattering and stranding them.\n\nThey attacked when he was locked down during covid. It's in the lore.\n\nThat's actually why the Slayer was locked in the Sarcophagus at the start of 2016. He was self isolating after catching covid.\n\nExactly! He puts his mask on straight away too. His guns aren't to kill anyone either. They're just his 6ft enforcers. If they happen to die, then it's cool, but they shouldn't be entering his space.\n\nThat's putting it lightly. Since modern Id under Hugo decided to canonize every single wad in existence, past, present, **and future** ***as canon.*** Doomguy has been at it for longer than entire multiverses have existed.\n\nThe Dark Ages in this case is a tiny tiny blip across this actual history, and only specifically deals with the tiny blip of Argent D'Nur.\n\n[deleted]\n\nESPECIALLY that one.\n\nThat's one of the most important ones!\n\nSo is he an actual immortal, or has some sort of \"hero reincarnates when they're needed\" sort of thing going on?\n\nHe’s too angry to die.\n\nHe can’t die until every demon in hell breathes out of the hole where their heads used to be\n\nFull immortality/time-travel shenanigans.\n\nLook up lore or videos on the most recent DOOM titles for more context. But basically after the events of DOOM 2, he was stuck in Hell (I think) but time works differently because inter-dimensional bullshit. Then he gets juiced up by the powers that be to do EVEN MORE ripping and tearing.\n\nYeah, he spent the equivalent of centuries in hell fucking up demons, until he was ...betrayed, or something, I forget.\n\nYeah the Night Sentinels were betrayed by the guy you meet in DOOM 2016, with the hammer. The Slayer himself was trapped by the demons because they couldn't fucking kill him, so they had to bury him in a temple and seal him away lol.\n\nCouldn’t kill Doom Slayer since he’d just reload at the previous checkpoint, so they trapped him in an eternal loading screen.\n\nActually they realized that as long as they didn't leave a blue key near the blue door he would be trapped.\n\nHe’s just really good at managing his HP and armor\n\nHe's immortal, he got juiced up on angel power iirc\n\nYes and no. The timeline for Doomguy specifically is:\n\nWolfenstein 3D (Doomguy's granddad)\n\n-&gt; Return to Castle Wolfenstein \n\n-&gt; Commander Keen (Doomguy's faddah)\n\n-&gt; Doom 1 (supposedly in an alternate early 21st century)\n\n-(shortly after)-&gt; Doom 2 \n\n-(a few peaceful years later)-&gt; Doom 64 \n\n-(shortly after)-&gt; Doom 64's \"Lost Levels\" added for the modern port \n\n-(stuck in hell for a long time, spat out into another dimension, lives there for some years, obtains artificial divinity, gets sealed in a coffin in hell, presumably unsealed in home dimension a hundred years later)-&gt; Doom 2016\n\n-(shortly after)-&gt; Doom Eternal+DLC\n\n---\n\nMeanwhile, Doom 3 is its own timeline with its own Doomguy who has an extreme fondness for duct tape. Then in Doom 3's expansion pack there's a second marine who is a Combat Engineer, and discovers his talent for ye olde rippeth and teareth and wears blue armor instead of green. \n\n**(e:** Apparently the BFG edition adds a third campaign and another marine, so that's three badasses in that timeline.**)**\n\n---\n\n\n[This isn't even scratching the surface here.](https://i.imgur.com/UaLpJOK.png) There's also links with Hexen/Heretic and Rise of the Triad, and by proxy some links to Duke Nukem as well.\n\nAfaik, Doomguy from Doom 1 and 2 ended up... *changing* in some way in his stay in hell. I haven't really played the new games yet, so I can't confirm.\n\nHe didn't change in Hell. He was ultra juiced up after getting out. It's all explained in Eternal.\n\nModern doom kinda bridges off of the ending to Doom 64, where the protag decides to just stay in hell and kick ass.\n\nTrailer looks fuckin rad. Won’t spoil anything in case someone hasn’t seen it yet but I for one am extremely happy Doom has been ripping and tearing it up again for the past decade.\n\npractice makes perfect\n\n[deleted]\n\nYeah you also kind of wipe out any ability for hell to be an issue for anyone anymore. It's a nice clean little ending for the story of the original Doom guy.\n\nYeah? Where do you think demons go when you kill them? Double-hell. Once he's done with regular hell he's got to wipe them again below. It's hells all the way down.\n\nActually no lie the next game being set near exclusively in the circles of Hell would be a great way to continue.\n\nULTRAKILL\n\nI can see Doom Guy absolutely not tolerating the mere idea that demons *might\" still exist in some dimension.\n\nI can’t remember the context but I think they set up some kinda extra dimensional beings that were sealed away in these menacing looking green pods that might be context for a future quake game team up thingy who knows\n\nDavoth wasnt really god tho, we still dont know who the mysterious voice is or who created Davoth. Hugo Martin said Davoth/The Dark Lord was more of just a ruler of certain worlds instead of the creator of everything, there is still something above him\n\nDavoth is also explicitly weakened and robbed of his power at that point, he says so himself. It’s implied to be a result of the Father and the Khan Maykr’s actions, but the Khan Maykr is an easier foe than Davoth was and Father is… VEGA. Until he isn’t. I’m not here to poke holes, I’m just saying Doom plays fast and loose with information and any given thing might change between games. One of the strengths of the plot being somewhat vague and full of flowery language is that it gives them room to play with ideas as they flesh out what it is they want to do.\n\nWe really got Doom Game of thrones before GTA6\n\nIt’s more Doom Army of Darkness but hell yeah\n\nThere better be a \"This is my boomstick\" achievement/ trophy.\n\nReleasing in 2025 too. Could be after GTA 6\n\n[removed]\n\nIt’s very bizarre and opens up a lot of room for *really fucked up shit*. \n\nGoing medieval on someone’s ass is not a good thing\n\nRemember the game Heretic in the 90's, it was a doom-like in medieval times, great game!\n\nWhat about this is bizarre? It just looks like doom to me.\n\nnot really, it definitely takes place during the urdak and sentinel war which was EONS before eternal so hells technologywould definitely of been less advanced\n\nHeretic = Doom style\n\nThis should be Higher up man. heretic WAS medieval Doom.\n\nWhat about Hexen?\n\nYou mean Hexen: Beyond Heretic?\n\nHoisted by my own batard! 😭\n\nPetard?\n\nWaiting for a Hexen or Heretic revival similar to what they've done for DOOM.\n\nHeretic was so fucking good.\n\nI just recently played through all but the last episode, and it has held up so well.\n\nAlso- it can used with GZDoom and Brutal Doom to make Brutal Heretic!\n\nI have such love for Heretic's weapons (crossbow &gt; default shotgun, phoenix rod &gt; rocket launcher,  claw &gt; chaingun) and color palette. Heretic did vibrant colors so much better than Doom (when Doom did color we got FIREBLU...)\n\nI still remember the first time I played Heretic. Immediately tried IDDQD. Death.\n\nI love that their codes were just chicken, rambo, I forget the others\n\nThis guy's an OG FPS enjoyer.\n\nMedieval but with shotguns.\n\nThis is my BOOMSTICK!\n\nThis looks more PAINKILLER than actual DOOM. And I'm all in for it!\n\n[deleted]\n\nThe Electrodriver is still the best weapon in a shooter\n\n*Turok 2 Cerebral Bore is typing...*\n\nThe gun that grinds up Skulls into ammunition is VERY Painkiller.\n\nThat is the most metal shit I have ever seen, and I. WANT. MOOOOORE!!!\n\nHE.\nIS.\nTHE PAAAAAINKILLER!\n\nEdit: I thought y’all were talking about the Judas Priest song\n\nFaster than a laser bullet,louder than an atom bomb, chromium plated boiling metal , bighter than a thousand SssuuunnnnSS!!!!!!….. (metal intensifies)\n\nI fucking loved painkiller. Pinning that dude up against the wall and I was sold.\n\nThere is literally a stake gun and I swear that the shotgun sounds basically the same. They absolutely took inspiration from that classic.\n\nGroovy. \n\n\nOut of curiosity, will there be any chainsaws?\n\ndoes chainsaw shield count?\n\nBased on the lore of eternal the ending is going to be a bit depressing. But it'll be a fun ride along the way.\n\nAs far as I'm concerned the lore of Eternal was Pew Pew Rip Tear\n\nHonestly they could make shit up and pretend it was the actual lore all along and I don't care.\n\nThen repeat for the next installment.\n\nThat's exactly what they did. \n\nI’ll never forget the way the first Doom remake started with a screen trying to tell you the lore and Doom Guy just pushing it away in disgust. No lore, only kill.\n\nBeing fair, Eternal didn't really have much lore in itself. The entire twenty-five years between 2016 and Eternal was either presented as mile-long text documents or just not mentioned at all.  \n  \nEternal's story really felt like a Part 3 without a Part 2 to set any of it up.\n\nI've said the same thing a few times, it felt like they skipped the 2nd part of a trilogy when I started playing Eternal.\n\nHoly shit was it 25 years? I figured it was like a few months. Yeah I really liked the gameplay and hell on earth setting, but the big time jump with all the new characters out of nowhere was off putting for me.\n\n&gt; Holy shit was it 25 years?\n\nYes. In *Doom (2016)*, the demons had just come through and hadn't left Mars yet. In *Doom Eternal*, it's stated a few times here and there that the UAC have been fighting demons on Earth for twenty-five years.\n\nIgnoring the lore of Eternal in favor of your approach is the best way to enjoy the game\n\nDoom 2016 was great because the player-facing lore was so unobtrusive. Yeah, there were data logs if you wanted to take a deeper dive but they didn't really enhance the narrative because the the narrative was literally just \"**Objective: kill hell**\".\n\nIdk why they thought Doom ever needed more than that.\n\nThe lore in eternal never got in the way of your ripping and tearing, but it was still present if you wanted it or are someone that likes game story and lore, like me.\n\ni played through 2016 3 times and couldnt tell you anything about its story\n\nIirc, the ending of this would be him being sealed away (by dropping a whole fucking temple on him) in the sarcophagus he emerges from at the start of doom 2016. Or am I missing something?\n\nEdit: so yeah I was missing something. Game will likely follow our beloved slayer during the events that are referenced in doom eternal. Mainly the betrayer's son plotline. Basically the betrayer we meet in mission 2 of doom eternal will betray us due to his son dying. He makes a pact with davon and the maykers(iirc) to revive his son, only for his son to become the icon of sin and his heart being the control point (hence why we stabbed it with the betrayers knife during the second to last missiom of DE)\n\nMy take is that this game will follow the slayer during the days of the betrayal and end with a gauntlet of a fight with the culmination being the temple dropping on him. \n\nI know it's an unpopular take, but I'm ecstatic with how their giving doom lore. In 2016 and eternal you can ignore it entirely and have a great time, but reading and paying attention to it makes the experience even better. I hope they follow that idea in this game \n\nRip and tear until it is done\n\none of your friends will betray you to revive his son, only for that son to become the icon of sin\n\nyou meet this friend in the second level of Doom Eternal\n\nIs that explained in doom eternal? \n\nHonestly, I tried to follow the story for a while, but quickly got lost and just played on. I might do a story run of it. Haha\n\nMedieval Prequel.. \n\nCome on they are right there.. Just tie Quake 1 into it man.. Just say the Ranger was part of the Doom Slayer team..\n\n[removed]\n\nJust revamp and tie in all of them. Hexen, Heretic, Catacomb, Shadow Knights, Wolfenstein.\n\nOh wolfenstein. If they could nab that back and do a “nazis found hell” twist, that’d be amazing.\n\nWolfenstein already part of the doom lore. \n\nDoom Marine is Doom Slayer, who is the Grandson of Commander Keen, and the Great great grandson of BJ Blazkowicz.\n\nWe just need Quake to be part of it, and boom we got the holy trinity finally in one universe, even though technically Doom Slayer is part of Quake Champions/Quake 3 arena we just need some real lore.\n\nSo it's basically QUAKE??\n\nRanger was a normal dude who was just trying to get back home though.\n\nSo was John, but demons killed his rabbit Daisy and here we are\n\nIsn't his name Flynn? Flynn Tagart?\n\nI'm pretty sure his name is just guy\n\nD. Guy\n\nNope, John Doom.\n\nSeriously though it's probably &lt;something&gt; Blazkowicz since he's the Wolfenstein dudes great great grandson or whatever.\n\nDoom became quake in 2016.\n\nI was thinking Heretic\n\nIt won't be the same without Mick Gordon\n\nstill blows my mind that they had such a smashing success with him, and they threw that relationship into the garbage over a deluxe edition OST \n\nit really won't be the same\n\nMarty fucked up massively he had one the most beloved audio engineers in the business to make one of the greatest sound tracks and treated him like shit\n\nI think he was jealous of Mick because Mick was a fucking rock star compared to Marty, and got loads of credit for making D2016 as good as it was. Marty is the highschool bully who has to make fun of people who succeed to feel better about being mid.\n\nD2016 is one of my all-time favorites, especially as a horror science fiction game. The environment and tone of the story, especially in the first half it is just amazing. When it came out I would just wander around the Mars base, just jaw-droppingly cool!\n\nMet Marty twice. First time he was a dick. Second time he wasn't a as much of a dick, but still kinda dickish.\n\nMarty is a piece of shit and deserves every word of criticism thrown his way.\n\nIf you read Mick Gordon's statement (alongside all the proof he included) it was way way more than a deluxe edition ost.\n\nid Software paid him late, stole work from him, gave him deadlines of sometimes just a few days, gave him inaccurate or straight wrong information about the levels, they even announced he was working on the ost before he'd agreed to it. And then after all of that they (Marty Stratton) lied about it all and said Mick was impossible to work with.\n\n[deleted]\n\nIIRC he released his statement almost precisely one year after he left Bethesda. He was 100% forced to wait to avoid being sued and NDA, even while Bethesda dragged his name through the mud.\n\nHe was trying to negotiate a settlement that would involve an NDA to avoid bad press, which would've been scrapped if he went public. He did so after he realized they were dragging their feet and didn't intend to settle.\n\nThat’s exactly why it took so long, dude was being careful\n\nAnd didn't they fuck with the mixing of his tracks?\n\nThey declined a bunch of his songs and didn't pay him for them. And then they remixed them and put them in the game anyway.\n\nIf the soundtrack sucks it will honestly kill the game. Like DOOM gameplay is very good but what makes DOOM great is the way the music blends with the gameplay to make you feel powerful. Take that out and it's just a normal arena shooter.\n\nyes and no... the guys who made the soundtrack for the 2 DLC packs are pretty talented\n\nAndrew Hulshult. Dude's work is badass. \n\n[removed]\n\nOh I remember playing that game when I was about 5 haha\n\nI don't know, that riff in the trailer is fucking rowdy.\n\nOooo I gotta check it out.\n\nA gun... where you put a severed head in it... and it crushes it up like a 90s ford escort at a scrapyard... then fires crushed skull shrapnels out the front...\n\nBWAH bah bah BAHHHH!\n\nYeah I'm sold whatever\n\nSkullfucked by a Skull Flak Cannon is S tier death metal song title.\n\nI like “Bone Shrapnel Flak Cannon” pretty good, feels snappier\n\nY’all are sleeping on Andrew Hulshult. Mick is a legend, but Hulshult is capable in his own right.\n\nGordon gave us two amazing soundtracks, probably some of the most iconic themes in video games ever, and he'll always be the GOAT, but I say let's give these newcomers a chance whoever they might be... it's probably been the dream for a lot of heavy metal artists around the world to get to work on Doom, and I'd like to see what they can cook up with a fresh perspective.\n\nDoom guy got a fucking parry? I'm sold. That was all I needed to see.\n\n\"Look at me. I am the Hexen now.\"\n\nI wonder if they'll fuck over the next composer too\n\nHOLY SHIT I'M SO HARD RN! I just watched the trailer and I dunno what to even say\n\nYeah, I had no idea this was coming out, and this looks awesome so far.\n\nDid the musician get fucked around a bunch this time? Or was the musician for the game treated properly this time?\n\nAllegedly the reason Marty stratton hated Mick was that fans always brought up Mick's name when talking about 2016's success and that conflicted with Stratton's ego. \n\nAs long as these new musicians don't get too uppity I'm sure Marty won't see them as a threat /s\n\nLooks really good but I’ll be kind of torn if that creative director that screwed over Mick Gordon is still a part of this.\n\n*executive producer\n\nYou're thinking of Marty Stratton who Mick has the most beef with. Creative director is Hugo Martin who, as far as I'm aware, is pretty chill\n\nIt's a Bethesda game. Of course someone is getting screwed over.\n\nXbox showcase &gt; whatever the fuck sony did last week\n\nHelps that Xbox is showing a ton of shit that isn't coming out for a while as opposed to games releasing this year.\n\nStill a ton of games dropping 2024 too though\n\nRippith and tearith and watch out for the beast of Caerbanog (Edited for spelling)\n\nAhh yes, the classic medieval laser turret and space ship.\n\nIs that like the Far Cry Primal of the Doom franchise or something?\n\nIt's definitely still DOOM as we know it now, chainsaw is replaced with a cpt america shield with blades on it, stake throwing gun, one that crushes skulls and chunks out the shrapnel.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tk8lkmYGWQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tk8lkmYGWQ)  \nCheck out the trailer\n\nSmh ofc they made Doom guy woke now, pushing their liberal agenda by having him recycle the skulls of his enemies.\n\nRemember Mick Gordon\n\nIn the name of god\n\nFor the grace, for the might of our lord,\nFor the home of the holy,\nFor the faith, for the way of the sword,\nGave their lives so boldly!"
