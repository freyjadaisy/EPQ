    "body": "There are a lot of ungrounded, floaty, wannabe-holy people out there. Please don't be one of them. \n\nI started meditating as a way to cope with my unstable upbringing and to quell the very confusing \"psychic\" experiences I was having, where I could seemingly predict what was going to happen before it did. I grew up in a scientific household and didn't believe in \"woo-woo\" spiritual ideas (little did I know!). \n\nI started with simple guided meditations, and graduated to more specific techniques like Mindfulness, Vipassana, and Transcendental Meditation. In every meditation community I dove into, there was always a strong subset of people who treated the technique like a religion: unquestioning devotion (which is valuable), with complete suspension of critical thinking and skepticism (not as valuable). \n\nSo to start: \n\nMistake 1) They treat meditation like a religion.   \n  \nHere's what's going to happen: You're going to get benefits from meditation, a lot of benefits, and then you're going to erroneously believe that EVERYONE must do what you have done, because it worked for you. \n\nEveryone has their own path, and it is the correct path because it is THEIR path. Don't develop a dogmatic relationship to the practice. It worked for you because you were ready for it, and it won't work for your friend because that's not what they need at this point of their journey. Support people's path, without projecting your own onto them. \n\nMistake 2) They believe they are a saint, spirit, or soul living a physical experience. \n\nYou're very much a human being, with many tens of thousands of years of biological evolution literally in your veins and in every one of your cells. Honor the process, and honor your context and roots. I saw many people wanting to force an ideal of enlightenment onto their physical being. Stop it. Just be, because that's enough, and living is already a cosmic experience (literally, because we're flying among stars). \n\nThis type of \"ungroundedness\" was ever-present in every community I was a part of. People completely disconnected to the physical experience of their bodies, which is literally the context you have been experiencing existence through. Touch some grass. Feel your body. For me, the key to unlocking my intuition in a reliable way started through feeling my body, and being in tune with the additional senses we've developed over thousands of years, to warn us of dangers lurking on the horizon. \n\nMistake 3) They don't understand the purpose of a tool. \n\nMeditation is a tool, and one of many. And different meditation techniques are variations on a tool. I had people tell me, repeatedly, that this ONE meditation technique was the key to solving all of life's problems: from too much stress to not feeling productive enough, to too much sleep to not being able to sleep at night. They didn't understand that you can have many tools, and different tools work for different purposes. \n\nMaster a tool, move on to the next one, and collect as many as you can. Tools like meditation are the weaponry in your arsenal. You can use them as the situation calls for them. For some people, exercise and drawing are just the thing they need in their personal growth journey. For others, it's classic rock. For others, it's therapy and prescription medicine. \n\nJust because this one tool worked for you, doesn't mean it's going to work for everyone, and for everything. \n\nPersonal growth is a long journey, and I've certainly had a crazy one. \n\nTake good care of yourselves, and call your mother. \n\n\\-Dj\n\n",

    "all_comment_text": "I just decided to skip all that stuff and become enlightened instead\n\nYea, who need meditation when you can directly go to enlightenment?\n\nCan i buy a ticket?\n\nThose are usually 150ug and will get you faster to enlightenment than riding on the back of sadhgurus motorcycle\n\nI love psychedelics as much as any psychonaut does, but I would not recommend it to anyone who hasn't done sufficient inner work. It's fun, no doubt. But it can mess you up if you have a lot of unseen baggage.\n\nHuh, psychedlics are how I saw my unseen baggage. But I do agree that there are many kinds of mental baggage (or brain morphology) that counterindicate psychedelics.\n\nYes and no, i agree that would be the best way. But often people even notice their baggage just because of the psychedelics and therefore start to go the journey of inner work. Usually psychedelic people end up going the meditation route, but also sometimes too much like OP described haha. I don‚Äôt know which is best. I also agree that some people should be very careful taking it\n\nüíØ truth right there!\n\nThAt'S nOt TrUE EnLigHtenmeNT\n\nCome on, 150ug is only like a quarter of enlightenment.\n\nAlso, don't you know it's only plant medicines and a shaman that can take you there? \n\nMandatory /s\n\nAhh a true enlightened one!\n\n‚ÄûTrue enlightment is not meditation, nor taking a tab of acid. The truly enlightened are those who take 4 tabs of acid‚Äú come on take more ;) \n\nYeah you‚Äôre right, psilocybin is much better than 4- aco-dmt haha\n\n150 ug for enlightment ? I would go for 600‚Äô\n\nRealise that the one controlling your body and mind is illusion and let go of control. Don't try to control your mind. Then you will be fine with all the thoughts as you have given up your relationship with them.\n\nThat's exactly what I am learning right now. As a beginner meditator I did a lot of suppressing my thoughts and feelings especially when they were \"wrong\", \"evil\" or causing suffering. Now I am trying to be just an observer and don't interfere with what is going on within me.\n\ntreat your thoughts like diarrhoea. Let it out to empty your stomach (brain).\n\nWhen you are able to find the ticket booth a ticket will be provided.\n\nThis is a pretty solid plan. You're already there! üòÇ\n\nNot sure why I can't reply to the original thread but here goes.\n\nNot sure why you would need to collect as many tools or variations of tools as possible, that just isn't practical in any way. A master knows his tools and uses most of his tools - as you said - accordingly, when a situation arises. However there are tools he ALWAYS uses. Tools without which he wouldn't be considered a master in a certain field. Those tools are for people to discover themselves, so on that note I'm gonna give you your own advice: these are your opinions that work for you, that btw no one asked you for. I wonder why it's always the conceited people telling people not to be conceited. Ridiculous.  The eyes can't see themselves I guess. \n\nP. S. Call your father. Peace.\n\nHow I didn't think of this before. You are a genius\n\nNo one is enlightened. They have some expanded awareness, but if you were enlightened you would have a very contrasting experience in reality.\n\nI'm here for the human experience, and therefore have no interest in enlightenment\n\nI'm so sick of the flippant that is not funny.\n\nMy problem is when i find something even minutely helpful, i start giving ppl advice about it.  (Like thats what i start doing instead of using the tool)\n\nIt‚Äôs because talking about it gives you a dopamine reward similar to actually doing. Theres research on it- like talking about a book you‚Äôre writing makes you less likely to actually write it.\n\nTo fixate on imagined results of action is not the same as intentionality and planning. To concede that it is impossible to accomplish your aspirations if ever they're disclosed, because all fatal misunderstanding of one's own rewards system, is stupid. Dilligently get your shit done. No need to announce that you're doing it, regardless of what Twitter or Facebook has trained you to believe. Likewise, if you need help, and make that clear, even obvious, and no one helps you, it's genuinely not the same as procrastinating  or chasing dopaminegic highs.\n\nThe excursions into meditative circles are absolutely non-different. Not to sound all dogmatic, but the 8-fold path... Really helps balance out perspective, especially when your own perspective seems to be missing.\n\nWhat is the name of this phenomenon? I‚Äôd like to read the research!\n\nHow does this inform us about the behavior? How can this be actioned?\n\nI find this is a natural biological reaction. Our species probably depended on this behavior to survive. \"Ooooh this fruit is edible, and tastes good. I must tell the whole village to eat it!\" \n\nProjection is a big part of human behavior.\n\nSo this is what Eve did to Adam. I've never considered this origin story to be an allegory for controlling dopamine response.\n\nThat‚Äôs really great work, noticing such behavior. If we feel the need to change a behavior, we need to see it exactly when and where it happens. The sooner we notice it each time, the closer we get to it.\n\nSo‚Ä¶ when you find a way to help your self, you help others instead. When and where might that happen next?\n\nPractice noticing by looking for it exactly when it happens and giving attention to *that* moment.\n\nAt least you see this. I love (SARCASM!) having people  give me set rules for something that is ALL LOSELY BASED AND PERSONAL  CHOICE!!  Let people  see it their own way! The magic here is that there ARE NO RULES! üòÜ Bless you for looking at your actions with an open mindedness!\n\nIMO it‚Äôs okay, and even good, to tell people about something that helped you, but you need to have done it for at least 6 months. Not 2 weeks. And only tell them once and not bring it up again unless they ask.\n\nanother mistake IMO is the framing of the practice as a means to ‚Äúfix‚Äù x or y. of course the practice provides tangible benefits but the trap i see here is when we apply a western mindset of i do ‚Äúx‚Äù for ‚Äúy‚Äù  \n \ni call it the self help trap.  \n\nhope this makes sense\n\nI‚Äôve been taught to think of this as a subtle form of self aggression: if I‚Äôm meditating to ‚Äúbecome a better person‚Äù, then each time I practice I‚Äôm reinforcing the belief that I‚Äôm not good enough\n\nFantastic post, and just what I need as I begin my meditation journey. I‚Äôm big on collecting personal tools - it‚Äôs so helpful to see this process (of finding the right way for ME to sit) as another one. And it takes the pressure off in a big way! Really appreciated.\n\nYou're welcome! Every path is the right path, because it is YOUR path! (At least that's what works for me üòã)\n\nNumber 1 is interesting giving that it‚Äôs been a religious practice for like thousands of years\n\nReligion used to be the main vehicle for passing on important knowledge between generations. It is (mostly) no longer the main way.\n\nWashing your hands has been a religious practice for thousands of years.  That doesn't make washing your hands inherently religious.\n\nIt also doesn‚Äôt make washing your hands a mistake.\n\nThat's true.  My whole point is that washing your hands (cleaning the body) and meditation (cleaning the mind) have their roots in religious traditions but we now understand the benefits in such a way that we can leave the religious aspects behind while still gleaning those benefits.  We don't need to let our actions be shaped by primitive superstitions, but we also don't need to fear those superstitions so much that we neglect the parts that ancient people got right.\n\nNot at all, trying to strip meditation of its religious origins is the problem. Meditation is a practice that went through constant development for about 5,000 and literally many of the intricacies of what happens when you practice a certain technique are there in these religious (mainly Eastern religious) texts. Obviously not every technique was written down or available on the internet and still have to be learned from a lineage that passed it down orally, but no amount of reading scientific articles is going to take someone through the depths of what this practice has to offer. It's not just sitting and watching your breath and continuously bringing it back. Don't get me wrong anapanasati is great, but there's so much more to this path.\n\nTbf washing your hands has been a practice for only about a hundred years\n\nIn some cultures, yes.  But it existed as a religious practice long before it entered modern medical practice.  It's been a key Jewish tradition for at least 2,000 years and the evidence indicates it was already a well-established tradition at that time.  My whole point is that the religious aspects of the practice don't mean that the modern version backed by science is inherently religious.\n\nAh I see. That‚Äôs fair\n\nFFS. It was just a way to convince people to be clean. Remember that guy that‚Äôs gonna handle that candle right before you‚Ä¶he was elbow deep in cow guts last night. Or chopping wood all morning. Or brushing down a horse. Dirty!!!\n\nSo if course u gotta wash ur hands at least once a week. That‚Äôs why that started. \n\nThey made it a ritual by it a consistent message.\n\nSo has morality. Religion is a complex, elaborate delivery system, but it‚Äôs not necessary\n\nIt may not be necessary, but it‚Äôs still wrong to say that it‚Äôs wrong, when it is being used that way.\n\nYou can use a stapler as a door stop. Doesn't mean a stapler is a door stop.\n\nReligion is certainly not always used well. Meditation isn‚Äôt religion, religion is a set of beliefs that meditation fits into. Having meditation be part of a religious practice is one thing, centering meditation as the religion itself is another.\n\nMeditation is certainly not always used well. Snipers use it to kill people more efficiently. Meditation was invented by religion so it‚Äôs inappropriate to say that it‚Äôs wrong to use it that way.\n\nI agree mostly with you, but saying people dont have souls is something I have to disagree.\n\nActually I disagree on \"mistake 2\".\n\nThis has been YOUR experience \n\n&gt;Everyone has their own path, and it is the correct path because it is THEIR path.\n\nLike you said yourself.\n\nIf someone chooses path of spirituality its their choice.\n\nThis is true, and I agree. These are also my own projections, based on my experience.\n\nI was going to say this. The first point is making a big thing about everyone having their own path, and that being ok, then the second point  dismisses those who choose a different path/perspective. That their pov is not as valid.\n\nMaybe there are no ‚Äòmistakes‚Äô, but instead experiences‚Ä¶\n\nI agree. Each person should figure out what's good for them and the only way to do that is through their own experiences. There's no such thing as a \"mistake\" if it's leading them on a path of knowing what they want from meditation.\nThe same way I don't believe in having regrets in life. They're just experiences that are a patchwork quilt of  our past that made us who we are at the end. Life is ultimately just a bunch of stuff that happens and we decide how we want to perceive it.\n\nWhat do you think about meditation in its original religious context?\n\nThere's a lot of things in human culture that are incorporated into old religions because back in the day, the line between religion and culture was very blurry.  That doesn't mean those practices have no place in a modern context, simply that they need to be reframed to examine what is useful about them.\n\nI also find myself questioning if those religions truly invented the practice, or if they can merely boast that they are the earliest written form of the practice.  Religions have a habit of taking useful practices that the people only partially understand and incorpoting them into their religion.  That doesn't make the religions the inventor of the practice, simply historical distributors of the practice.\n\nAs an example, the religion I was raised in has used washing your hands and fully cooking your meat as religious practices for thousands of years.  That doesn't make doing those things in the modern day inherently religious.  In fact both actions are recommended by the CDC as a way to reduce infection vectors.  It's likely someone noticed that way back in the day and, after only partially understanding the benefits, incorporated them into the religion.  It is likely that there's a similar story with meditation.\n\nIt‚Äôs a different version of morality - baked into religion but not dependent on it. Anyone can be moral, you don‚Äôt have to be religious\n\nNumber 1 is pretty much the main reason I stopped visiting this subreddit.\n\nMeditation doesn't have to be spiritual. It can be purely for your mental health. In fact from the point of view of those of us who don't believe in anything spiritual that is all it can be and you trying to attach something spiritual to it is a turn off.\n\n[deleted]\n\nEnlighten up, Frances\n\nMistake 4. They start giving advice\n\nIt‚Äôs Reddit, we love giving advice!\n\nWhat's wrong with helping other people on the path? Imagine if no one ever wrote books or discussed their findings to help others along. Every path is unique for sure, but people surely need to compare notes. Imagine doing this with 0 prior knowledge or help from people before us because they were averse to giving advice.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with helping people on their path but it is very common for people to think they've mastered meditation after 6 months or even one or two years and then start giving advice but in reality they're still very novice.\n\nImagine reading this post when meditation is literally part of your spiritual practice. ‚ÄúMistake‚Äù number one is not the most helpful point for a lot of people, it‚Äôs an insult.\n\nCalling people ‚Äúwanna be‚Äù in this context flies in the face of everything I know and want to know about meditation, so I didn‚Äôt bother to read past the first sentence.\n\nAccurate. üòÇ\n\nlike the OP does?\n\nUnless asked, and OP is saying something I would like to know.\n\n[deleted]\n\nI came here to say this.\n\n\n2 is something you learn as you grow in the process. I don't think it's fair to call it a mistake. It's not a distraction in the way points 1 and 3 are.\n\n\nPoint 2 is historically why we meditate. To overcome this delusion of self. How that self is masked is irrelevant, but we are all doing it to some variation.¬†\n\n\nPoints 1 and 3 are more residual projections of the mind. Which if I'm being honest I can't fully fault anyone for falling into these traps either because this is a result of the defense mechanisms of the mind but the faster you overcome these distractions the quicker you'll move on the more important goal of reconciling point 2.\n\nEdit: while I agree that psychedelics are a great tool to dissolve the ego, I ignored that point because this is a meditation forum.\n\nnose pet fanatical historical makeshift alive outgoing hobbies disarm judicious\n\n *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev/home)*\n\nWell everyone and you is the same thing for an enlightened person\n\nI love this response, thank you üå∏\n\nI agree with your point, I would only say that ‚Äúillusion of ONLY being a physical being‚Äù, because I feel that these ‚Äúcatalyst‚Äù provide us with a connectedness we don‚Äôt often, or perhaps ever, get to experience, and that connectedness is the physical body connecting to the spiritual form so I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs one or the other and I don‚Äôt believe anything is dispelled entirely. In my experience, these ‚Äúcatalyst‚Äù turn down the noise of the ego so low that all is left is your most primal physical self and the spirit that has always been there. The reason I say it didn‚Äôt dispel it entirely is because you eventually come down and depending on what you used, your ego immediately, or over time, will resurface to help navigate you in this life.\n\nYou're correct in this thinking. You don't lose your ego while on a psychedelic. However it does shut down for a little bit.\n\nNah, if you pay attention stuff is much more amazing than the simplified version you get from hallucinogens.\n\nLSD, shrooms, ayahuasca/DMT, etc  can be good crutches to stop taking reality for granted, but this moment is always happening.\n\nThis user is on point with his second point as well\n\n  \nDon't get me wrong, i recommend trying all of the above, but I would also recommend tequila\n\nI've been doing a fair deal of mushrooms, and it does make you understand the physical world is some sort of reduction of what's really going on. However, it's this world you're incarnated into, so it's in this dimension that you'll find the things you're supposed to learn. \n\nIf you're incarnated into this physical dimension, it's for a reason. It's for you to live this physical life, and not to discard it as if it's not relevant. If it weren't relevant to you, you wouldn't be here.\n\nI agree with OP, and in my experience DMT teaches the opposite of what you say. The self dissolves, which shows you it never existed. We are just physical beings. We only have our experience.\n\nAny understanding or feeling of a soul or spirit is an illusion, an illusion separating you from every aspect of physical existence.\n\nWe are all god in disguise, yes, I am on board with that. But not because we have an individual soul or spirit. Rather because there is no soul or spirit. There is no objective separation between people. The alleged existence of a soul is the strongest denial of this reality.\n\nWell said, the three things are solid. I do agree. I need to say this to my understanding of your post‚Ä¶ Remember those people you criticize also are on their own path which is just as valid for them, as yours is to you. I just see a dichotomy in that in your post, It is each of our personally.\n\nThis post lacks a lot of softness and warmth. It feels very judgemental and from the ego.\n\nDid you truly write this to help others? Or just from your own personal frustrations?\n\nI disagree. It's the sort of direct and clear wordings that helps me most in my personal growth. I suppose it's different for everyone. It might not work for you, but the fact that OP is sharing, to me is enriching and a gift that helps me.\n\nNo offence, just something for you to consider: maybe OP is not giving from his or her ego, but rather you're receiving with yours and your projecting that on OP.\n\nWhen I read some posts they fill me with acceptance, warmth and kindness. Like a loving warm grandmother sharing her wisdom.\n\nWhen I read posts like that I think. Woah, this person must truly be wise and have grown massively on the path. I aspire to grow towards being like that.\n\nPerhaps look into ‚Äúnon violent communication‚Äù or ‚Äúauthentic relating‚Äù. Positive, warm and connecting communication is not as subjective as you might think.\n\nI have little attachment to anything the OP said. As for me it‚Äôs quite common advice I‚Äôve heard several times before. And I agree there‚Äôs some value in it. Buts it‚Äôs all too surface level with little substance to truly be profound or impactful from my perspective.\n\nYou don't see the value until you meet the people that should read this post. I've met them and I'm one of them, and it's a very terrible thing that I don't wish to anyone.\n\nI don't think meditation is about acceptance, warmth and kindness per s√©. This is a common error a lot of (beginning) meditators make. Here in Spain we'd say they expect it all to be \"happy flowers\". \n\nI think meditation is about seeing things as they really are, and reality can be very, very crude.\n\nI think it all comes down to life's choices. I'm not going to convince you of anything that's against your will. I personally choose to be happy and peaceful and that's why I do meditation.\n\nI do care about reality, but I also accept that there are so much I don't know and will never know. No one has ever really been able to understood gravity, though we have theories, but those are just people making their best guesses, and that's knowledge.\n\nMeditation confronted me with my dark side as well, far away from anything happy and peaceful, and I'm still working through that. My irl teachers told me that if your aim is just to find happiness and peace through meditation, it becomes just another form of evasion - the contrary to facing reality. \n\nI'm not saying you're doing anything wrong or that you should see things differently, but since we're having this very honest conversation, I thought I'd share this with you.\n\nI really appreciate you sharing your perspective! I loved to hear it indeed.\n\nAs I said, I do care about reality. My aim is to find happiness and peace. And during that journey, I have had to confront my dark sides, and worked though those. I have gone through so many dark nights for a long time to heal. Eventually, I'm glad I'm quite satisfied with the peace and happiness as a result (though I'm nothing compared to anyone). \n\nMy only small concern about what OP has said is that, OP seems to be identified with their own views, quite strongly, that it lacks openness, which I think leads to a bit of division and harshness towards people who have different choices. Perhaps there is nothing wrong with that? But I think since you can't change anyone unless they choose to change, the harshness is quite inconsequential.\n\n[deleted]\n\nI'm glad it works for you, I really am. Personally, I prefer to be accepted for the being that I am. I don't do well with harshness. \nThat being said, I agree with many of  OP's opinions. I just think I think the harshness is unnecessary. I can't change anyone, I don't know how to, I love them for who they are and I choose to be kind with my words.\n\nIf someone if padding what they are saying with softness and warmth I just assume they are trying to sell me something or they think I‚Äôm a moron.\n\nI liked the post. I enjoy that people are complaining that he isn‚Äôt pandering to them. Good for him that he wrote it for himself.\n\nYou are free to assume that softness and warmth are what people do when they try to sell you something or they think you're a moron.\n\nBut if I treat you with softness and warmth, it's because I consider you are a human being and I think we all deserve the warmth. I want nothing in return from you. But I don't force that on you though.\n\nI strongly agree with you on this! I hope I can talk to you more since I can resonate with your thoughts a lot.\n\nI think it's ok for OP to have opinions, but people's choices should be respected. People should do whatever they wish to as long as it does not harm others.\n\nI do agree that the post really emits a sense of frustration, which, I think , is quite unnecessary.\n\nFeel free to message me or reply here.\n\nI‚Äôm still a huge work in progress myself. But my path is towards softening, opening up, compassion, kindness, spaciousness and calm. I‚Äôve made quite huge progress in those during the past year through various meditation, visualisation and therapy based techniques.\n\nI strongly believe deeply connecting to others must be a key component in the path. And I‚Äôm grateful to have met people in my life who absolutely radiate those qualities I mentioned before.\n\nGood old fashioned crack rock, a timeless classic.  And it DOES WORK FOR EVERYONE. SMOKE IT.  SMOKE CRACK RIGHT NOW\n\nYou seem guilty of these behaviors yourself since you feel it‚Äôs your place to sit above us and instruct us on your vision of meditation.\n\nAnytime i hear someone claim to know what another person is thinking or feeling, I have to wonder if the person making the claims isn't projecting.\n\nI think we should banish all people who want to give advice to Reddit. Having them here is optimal to them blabbing my ear off about something they don‚Äôt understand while I‚Äôm trying to enjoy myself.\n\nMy point is, keep people who are giving advice on the internet.\n\nExcellent points.  I had some take aways somewhat different from other's.\n\n1 and 3. Meditation is not a religion, it's a religious practice.  Similar to prayer, abstinence, attending services at church/temple/mosque, etc.  Generally, for most religions, you want to be as close to whichever deity or transcendental state you worship.  Meditation is the map or vehicle to get you there, not the result itself.  You've still got to follow the map and drive the car yourself to get there.\n\n2. There's a fine line between sharing your experiences and pushing your viewpoints on others.  Part of it is nowadays, there's so much noise out there, you've got to be loud to get attention.  Loud does not equate with effective communications.  I've been traveling recently, and noticed that people will repeat themselves louder and louder in English overseas.  There's some belief that everyone should understand what they're saying and if they repeat it often and loudly enough their message will get through.  And some do it with a contemptuous arrogance.\n\nThis is an extremely thoughtful post. \nIt exposes a depth of experience and knowledge.\n\nGreat advice about others not being ready for meditation... i feel like I mention it,  but don't force it.  I hope everyone finds meditation beneficial,  and I do believe everyone can benefit.... but it is a \"horse to water\" prospect: there's no guarantee anyone will listen to your advice. \n\nI observe,  practice,  and stay open to new intuition.  Thanks for imparting yours onto others that are willing to heed your wisdom =]\n\n[deleted]\n\nDid your ego write this completely by itself? \n\nWe are all ‚Äúwanna bes‚Äù on this earth my friend, you are no better than one who started yesterday. Come back in another 30 years maybe you‚Äôll see\n\nCompletely agree.\nMeditation is a tool, even if many religions and beliefs use it, the act itself is secular.\n\nI haven't meditated for over 30 years because that would be too long.\n\nTotally agree. The \"woo woo\" ideas like chakras, or OBEs came to me unexpectedly after \\~10 years of serious meditation. Without trying to sound like I'm bragging, I consider this \"advanced level\" spirituality and many people want to believe in a lot of supernatural concepts before they have even began feeling energy moving around their bodies or able to meditate for days at a time for example. This post was much needed. Reminded me that I really don't know anything for certain.\n\nI don't like how concepts such as chakras are portrayed in the west, its a very watered down version of what they actually represent. The vedic writings on energy centres in the body are incredibly complex and chakras are just one aspect. I remember seeing books like \"the beginners guide to opening chakras\", which is a phenomenon usually reserved for people who lived in caves, fasted for weeks on end and did nothing but meditate their entire lives. Not that someone can't have that experience today but it's not easy.\n\nAm I crazy or is this a lot of hypocrisy? I don‚Äôt mean to be rude, but I also can‚Äôt help but notice how much you say ‚Äúwhat works for you doesn‚Äôt always work for others‚Äù while continuing to list off a bunch of stuff that works for you but may not work for others. \n\nThe human experience is a personal one. What someone‚Äôs belief system, religion, meditative practices, or critical thinking skills look like is different than what that person has on the inside. What people see on the surface of someone is a fraction of insight into their world. You can‚Äôt possibly know any life as deeply as your own, so of course you have an internal bias no matter how hard you try not to. You don‚Äôt know what that person has experienced in order to arrive at the conclusions they have. All those points you listed could very well be the thing someone centers their entire meditation practice around, and that‚Äôs perfectly alright. \n\nThere are certain monks who have practiced great acts of suffering that lead to death just to experience their idea of enlightenment. For example, starvation. Starvation is very obviously not religious by nature, and yet someone out there decided that it was for them. The practice is called Sokushinbutsu. The act of mummifying yourself by starving to death while meditating and reciting mantras. To the majority of people, they would call this insane, stupid, question why anyone would go through this just to die. To K≈´kai, this was an act of pure enlightenment. \n\nThis was just an example, but people are entitled to live with the mentalities they choose as long as it‚Äôs not a threat to others or yano a crime or something. As much as you may not resonate with something, someone else does deeply.\n\nGood point\n\nYour post has inspired me to once again try and regularly meditate until it becomes something I do routinely. I think this will be attempt 27 or something üòÇ but thank you for inspiring me today, one day it will stick!\n\nI find these things work themselves out with time. After enough practice you learn to start letting go and ride a balance between just being with light awareness vs trying to uphold some concentrated State Of Mind. I went through a phase of trying to \"kill\" the ego and it brought upon a dark night that was very intense and is still there but not longer triggers a reaction. Learning to embrace that shadow self and integrate it into the present has turned fear into something much more powerful.\n\nOn of the many thing Meditation brings us is the recognition of the ego.\n\nIn my beginning i was surprise how much ego is intertwined with our life.\n\nEven today, after many years i deal with the ego on a daily basis.\n\nThose 3 thing OP mentionned originate from ego which is ironic IMHO\n\nExcellent points ! Thanks for sharing your wisdom! I'm going to save this post because alot of these points need revisiting from time to time!\n\nI think you made a good observation. I didn't realize I was guilty of projecting my own path till just now.\n\nI see it everywhere. You can do sport just to improve your health and wellbeing, but it doesn't make you an athlete. At least - it's not mandatory. It doesn't need to be super competitive or even intensive. You do sports on your own terms.\n\nFor me meditation is very similar to a sport. Like a sport is training your body and muscles, meditation is training your mind. The purpose of that training is almost identical. To improve your wellbeing and abilities.\n\nSome people will say IDK, karate or kung-fu are philosophies. Maybe they are, but they can be also treated as sports, even recreational (non competitive) sports. Something that you do as a hobby.\n\nI'm not saying the casual approach is good, and more goal oriented is bad. The point is they are all good as you doing something very healthy.\n\nVery refreshing post\n\nMistake 4) Using meditation as a way to avoid negative thoughts and to control your mind. This is spiritual bypassing and the most common mistake I have seen (and have done my self). Instead, we should be compassionate to our selves, obvserve and apprach our thoughts and emotions in a curious non-judmental way. Understanding the source of negativity and letting it come to full intensity is what drives healing and growth. Its crazy how long it took me to understand this.\n\nStraight up facts man. I had a transcendent experience in meditation. I laughed my ass off when I realized the whole 'I am God' thing is completely separate from being human. I am God is a really enticing identity trap. Like, I do not have superpowers, I am not a divine messenger, I'm just a dude. People would have you believe it's super-natural, but it's actually super-normal, and to be clear the use of super in both words is precisely identical.\n\nAll I know is that with meditation I have discovered who I am, what my control in life actually is, and have the tools to navigate that as a process. I understand Karma and impermanence, emptiness of self, emptiness of object, the nature of suffering and desire, and through that I learned to distinguish Dharma from desire within my own mind, and have been applying that understanding to my life, transforming myself for the better. Total unification of my mind was a temporary experience, but it showed me what is possible, and I know I can approach that again through the purification process of my thoughts, emotions, and conduct.\n\nThis post!!!üôåüèªüôåüèª\n\nThere are no mistakes. Each journey is unique\n\nWhat is enlightenment?\n\n\n\"It's the passing away of the distinction between enlightenment and non-enlightenment.\"\n\n\nShinzen Young, passed on from his teacher\n\nTLDR: drop spiritual pride. Add mindfulness.\n\n‚Ä¶ and Father!!!\n\nMistake number 4 ) they believe their experience of mediation is how it is for everyone\n\nNailed it. It‚Äôs a tool. One of many. Wait‚Ä¶.are you a hammer?\n\nHi. I‚Äôm wondering if you could talk to me about the difference between TM and mindfulness or watching your breath? I have cancer and there is some evidence in clinical trials that TM may impact tumors whereas mindfulness is more about quelling anxiety. I have taken to saying OM and watching my breath in a daily meditation and on occasion I‚Äôve used it when I am in pain or going through a procedure that is difficult. \n\nI have not bitten the bullet to get a personal mantra or been in any kind of real training. I just try to stay in meditation and slowly breathe in and out while saying a long OM on in breathing and outbreeding. Is that the principle behind TM? Am I missing something?\n\nI've been meditating for over 10 years now. I transitted your 3rd point a couple of years ago, and I'm transitting your point 2 on a very profound level right now. \n\nThank you for sharing these insights. Do you write more often and longer pieces? I'd be interested in reading more of you.\n\nThe physical is a result. It‚Äôs an end point of what came before it. So we are definitely physical beings, but manifested out of a creative energy that came before us. Physics moves from spirit &gt; mind &gt; emotion &gt; physical. You cannot create backwards. You can‚Äôt start with something physical and move in the opposite direction to find your way to spirit.\n\nI already made my comments on this so don't take this wrong way but when I read the title my brain immediately thought a clickbait ad was on the way to get me to buy some course on YouTube. üòÇ\n\nIn my time on Reddit I'm repeatedly surprised at how many people -- you included -- decide they know more than anyone else and should \"enlighten\" others. Most popular meditation has been borrowed from Buddhism. You've taken it out of context and added your own 2 cents. Yet somehow you think you're different from all the other people declaring their 2 cents?\n\nThank you for posting. I have been meditating for about ten years. All of these make it difficult to enjoy a community around meditation for me.\n\nI love this post. Very rational and needed to be heard.\n\nGreat post.\n\nWhether it‚Äôs getting ready to buy your first home, looking for your first job, or embarking onto a meditation or any other practice, it‚Äôs so important to calibrate expectations. \n\nBut as my teenager pointed out to me as we were discussing the state of homebuying in the world today, it can be hard for people with deep experience to remember what it was like to have none. It can be challenging to communicate what we‚Äôve learned without sounding callous or out of touch. \n\nNicely done.\n\n30 years of intimacy with your own attention gives you authority to speak about your own attention--    \n\n\nYou are just as full of it as they are.\n\nYou seem upset, maybe try meditation\n\nYou started the post off very negatively already. It's always best to be authentic ! and no matter who we are somebody is going to always have a bias. Please don't be one of them especially when those biases come from lack of understanding , ignorance and not knowing what you are talking about and forming  assumptions.  What I am also learning at my younger age is that for me as long as I know who I am that's all that matters.....\n\nIt's great you have been meditating for years hopefully that is true. If it is true , great!  And the longer the years we practice meditation and mindfulness the more powerful it gets and the better our longevity! I've been meditating off and on for over 17 years ! \n\nI would think you would at least start the post off with something positive and uplifting especially as it is pertaining to Meditation and mindfulness which is all about peace and love.....\n\nYou'll make a great clickbait blogger. Crap meditation teacher. I cant read this. Maybe the hippies will bite though. Welcome to the morning mind. No filter. Just honesty from someone else in marketing.\n\nYou seemed to have put a lot of effort in making this come off a certain way. I work with people in marketing daily that put less effort into their articles thsn this.\n\nWhatever this is. It isnt a meditation guide. Not really. I wont be surprised of you start popping up cheesy courses or how to align your chakra books next.\n\nThe 3 biggest mistakes people make are thinking they know what meditation is, thinking they know everything and thinking they can understwnd by reading. Simple.\n\nJust practice folks.\n\nGood morning op.\n\nNext time. Avoid the clickbait title. It is the number one biggest mistake new internet marketers make.\n\nThe one thing I learned in all the time I‚Äôve been meditating is that no matter how hard and how much one meditates, the mind still judges.\n\nThanks, OP. \n\nA very badly-needed post to keep \n\nthings in perspective. \n\nThanks again.\n\nThanks for your insightful comments. Made me think on my own spiritual journey in a new perspective.\n\nHold my beer... ok... I will try to keep this simple...\n\n... things are exactly as they are... what I mean is... \n\n...nah, if Buddha couldn't explain it... gimme that beer back. \n\nThanks for reading.\n\nWow that's a LONG read. I think I'll just skip all that and go meditate.\n\n.\n\nLove this, great post.\n\nDamn. Dj really just dropped the mic like that.\n\nUse your tools. Don‚Äôt be a tool. \n\nGreat write-up !\n\nI meditate and I‚Äôm asleep in less than 3 minutes :-)\n\nCalling mom now, thanks!\n\nWhat does it feel like to when you know you have achieved meditation? There are times I lay down for a nap and never fall asleep bc I feel like I am being spoken to and it‚Äôs not my mind but I‚Äôve never meditated or understood what it feels like to‚Ä¶ I literally feel like I‚Äôve been laying there for 20 minutes but when I come to it‚Äôs been a couple hours\n\nFirst you say we‚Äôre all on our own path so we shouldn‚Äôt interfere with people‚Äôs own beliefs and experiences surrounding meditation. But then you say that being ‚Äúungrounded‚Äù and believing that you‚Äôre a soul living a human experience is wrong. If that belief works for people, it works. You should follow your own advice of point 1 and  not interfere with the way each individual follows their own ideas.\n\nNumber two will blow your mind!\n\nThere are no mistakes in meditation. Theres just this\n\nI like this. Thank you ‚ò∫Ô∏è\n\nYeah but really though, more people need to meditate. They just can't sit still, and thats why they should practice it.\n\nThis is a GREAT post/PSA. Well done, and thank you!!!!\n\nThis was so good. Thanks man\n\nSo, I‚Äôd like to hear more about your ‚Äúpsychic‚Äù experiences - where have they led you, what you‚Äôve learned from them, have they benefited you?\n\nhave you arrived at what you believe is the most effective or ‚Äúbest ‚Äú method of meditation now or do you use several methods regularly?\n\nStacks and rotas like...\n\nDay 1: 5m breath, 15m metta, 5m grounding\nDay 2: 10m tree pose, 10m breath, 5m chakra\nDay 3: 5m walking meditation, 10m grounding, 5m sunyata\n\nRepeat\n\nI can‚Äôt meditate for five minutes ü•π. (Focus on the breath in and out.)\n\nMistake 4)\n\nIf you think a group is dancing for the sake of dancing and they use a bunch of spiritual language and hold hands and shit, beware, you're in a cult\n\nWhat are some good books to begin studying meditation?\n\nMistake 1) They treat meditation like a religion.\n\nAgree, for some people, they think meditation is belong to their religion. Fuck that. Meditation belong to anyone who wants it.\n\nGreat post, thank you!\n\nExcellent.\n\nThank you for sharing your insight! I have a personal question based on what you shared at the beginning of the post. You mentioned that you have ‚Äòpsychic‚Äô experiences. I have a similar situation where I have moments of clairvoyance and it *seems* random but I am not sure what triggers it or how to work *with* it. I don‚Äôt know anyone else personally who has this and I would appreciate your guidance or advice on how you honor and engage this gift. Ty\n\nAmazing post. I think I needed this post.\n\nhow did meditation affect your precognition?? cuz for me it's only made me more understanding of how this feature of nondual awareness works.\n\nGreat advice!!\n\nFollowing\n\nHii could u make a post on what impact it has on u when you meditated? I want to start meditating but I want to know the benefits and effects that has on u vs when u didn‚Äôt meditate.\n\nWow\n\nWhatever helps you in breaking the mirage of ego. And i pray whatever technique a person picks up it does not become like the daily anti depressant medicine without which they cant sleep.\n\nDeclare no 2 as mistake, is in my view your biggest mistake\n\nSorry to say this but reading your analysis  actually gave me an impression you yourself are very attached to your opinions and rather agitated by it all which is rather ironic . In the same timespan as you I generally noticed that most committed long term meditators rarely make similar,   (somewhat dogmatic ) statements  about others ..they tend to offer simple gentle advice in far less forceful manner . No doubt your post is well meaning but sometimes people who offer advice may benefit themselves from a little feedback as we are often blind to such things! I personally started meditating in 1992 but am still riddled with faults ..however like most of us they are stitched together with good intentions . Wishing you well .\n\nThis was really insightful. Thank you!\n\nHey, thank you for this post. Much needed. Very well said. Sober and practical unlike a lot of the speculative and dreamy nonsense some people like to speak about on here.\n\nWise, wise advise!\n\nLove this, so well-said and clearly the results of decades of work and reflection. Thank you!\n\n\"¬†¬†They believe they are a saint, spirit, or soul living a physical experience.\"¬† Because it is true. so what's the problem? And if you have been meditating for so many years and during this time you have not noticed that you are neither your mind nor your body, it means that you are doing something wrong. You are probably meditating incorrectly.\n\nThanks man\n\nReddit is so toxic, I just wanted to read OP‚Äôs experience and everyone in the comment section is judging OP calling them arrogant. Who are we to judge others? We are all human beings. Why not learn from what OP says and decide ourselves whether or not this information is beneficial to yourself. What‚Äôs beneficial to you will not be the same for everyone and vice versa.\n\nThank you so much for taking the time to respond. This is what I thought was likely and it‚Äôs helpful because I feel I can continue doing what I‚Äôm doing and see some benefit.\n\nI still don't understand it. \nWatch the thoughts and try to not let them carry me along \nIf they do come back to observing?\n\nWhat though Are the benefits,\nI wish I could stop this chatter even for a bit but it seems as much as it tires me, I'm addicted\n\n[removed]\n\nWhat meditation techniques do you use for which purposes? \n\nI learned some technique a long time ago where you hold some boring object (like a paper clip) in your mind throughout the meditation, but I forget what it's for. Sometimes I do it anyway just because it's fun and the novelty makes it easier to remain alert/engaged\n\nWow. I feel like this post is applicable to so many things in life. Saving. Thank you for sharing.\n\nI'm not sure I understand point #2. Are you asserting that non-duality is a false teaching?\n\nI think the last sentence of your first point contradicts your second. Some people discover their soul, saint hood, or spirit through meditation. I just want to make sure that people with that path don‚Äôt feel gaslit when their path unfolds. Our ancestors gave us that language for a reason. Meditation is a stepping stone for others walk alongside their spirit. I don‚Äôt know if your post was to demystify the practice. But there‚Äôs definitely spirt and mysticism for a lot of us. And if I read your post before I experienced what I have. I would have probably extended the time of finding my gift.\n\ni disagree with 2 \nevery single human being has a body and a soul inside of them. One can‚Äôt coexist without the other, \nAlso every one is different and experience energy differently, every one can be like you.\n\nThe first two mistakes can be summed up into \"not noticing that the meditation was interrupted by a thought\"\nAs in, you are meditating, present with the object, then you are distracted by thoughts and end up having strong opinions about yourself, your practice and how to help people. During the time these concepts were developed, the practice has already been abandoned. \n\nTaking a religious approach is not a mistake. In fact, it's quite a useful view when faced with difficulties and the practice isn't sufficient enough yet to overcome them by the practice of meditation itself. The problem is this dumb \"compassion\" that wants to convert people when oneself is not even half-baked. One already invites others onto this path without having a personal understanding of where one actually ends up threading this path.\n\nNot understanding the purpose of a tool is actually just not being clear enough what one wants, where one intends to end up. The goal is not being clear. Is it bodily health, mental health, some awakening, to cultivate presence to be successful in life and so on?\nWhen it's clear what one intends to do, the tools to be employed become quite obvious.\n\nThe best advice that helped the most I've always received from practitioners who weren't keen on teaching others, content with their meditation practice in and of itself.\n\nI couldn't agree more, what suits one won't suit another and that applies to most things and situations, when people are dogmatic they feel them and only them know the right way. We are all unique"

    "title": "I did 5-6 hours a day of yoga and meditation for 3 years - this is what I learned",
    "body": "So I had some mental issues and went ahead with yoga and meditation to better them. At this time I started 5-6 hours a day of some of the practices Sadh-guru teaches.\n\nThe first thing I have learned is people (including myself) are almost always in a state of unease - meaning their mind has to be constantly occupied, fidgeting with various things all the time. Few people can actually look you in the eyes and just be there with you in that moment. Everyone has a mind that is all over the place with compulsions to do this and that. Here is where my practice drasticly improved this condition for me. The compulsibe need to keep the mind occopied at all times went almost intirely away. Istead I just started paying attention to whatever was there - looking at things without being consumed by them. This also improves productivty by a lot.\n\nSecondly, a sense of abandon and desirelessness has come. I can simply sit with my eyes closed for an hour and just enjoy that without the need to stimulate my brain. There is a whole inner world where one can access very blisful states. You can access this if your body and mind becomes more still and less compulsive. When you are in touch with the inner stilness, it is hard for you to be truly bothered by anything, because at the core of who you are there is always a sense of peace.\n\nLastly, the sense of inner freedom and joy that has come is priceless. The smallest things like going for a walk in the forest or looking at the sky can bring joy. Nothing fancy thing to fulfill the list of endless desires is really needed anymore. Relations have reduced in numbers, but those that remain are much deeper and more fulfilling.\n\nThese are some of the things that have happened. I'm curious to hear your own experiences with meditation and yoga.",

Anything else u noticed?\n\nConstant resting awareness to anything and everything ü§î\n\nCould you expound further on this?\n\nI‚Äôm\nNever in my head so I‚Äôm constantly aware of everything , my inner world ( how I feel,react,behave ,self awareness basically ) and the outer world (the external world) everything else\n\nhow much do you meditate per day and what type of practice?\n\nAt this point in time I‚Äôm meditating as soon as I wake up ,by this I mean I‚Äôm here , present ,aware;however when I actually sit down and practice it ,could be from anywhere when I wake up, between 0-3 hours from waking up \nAnd through the day it could be anywhere between any count that I‚Äôll find myself bringing myself back to the breath and use it as an anchor (by doing this ) I‚Äôm constantly here , anchored (another word for present)\n\nAnd I‚Äôm not specific but I do all kinds of meditation practices, nothing planned , whatever arises in the moment,\nUsed headspace app for about 6 years and learned everything and mostly I could until I got comfortable without it\n\nI have only recently started meditating but I too hope to get to this state if internal stillness/peace all the time eventually.\n\nSomething that has helped me which I don‚Äôt see mentioned too often is practicing photography. \nIdeally not on your phone but with an actual mechanical camera. \n\nIt allows you to slow down and spend more time observing everyday objects, how the light reflects and changes over time on things otherwise unnoticed. \n\nThere‚Äôs one exercise I learned when I first started to become a better photographer. Simply go find a tree that looks interesting and you can get close to. Photograph it from 10 different angles and see how small differences in perspective can make a huge difference.\n\nSomething that I think helps me too is sniping on call of duty. ü§£ I never find myself being so alert and present.¬†\n\nmade my day\n\nNice. Gonna try this üò∏\n\nAwesome! A bonus tip is ‚Äúhigh low fast and slow‚Äù - high and low referring to angles and fast and slow referring to shutter speed. For example, photographing a waterfall at a slow shutter looks way different than a fast shutter - more ethereal and magical. \n\nShooting large objects from low angles make them look bigger. Even laying on the ground can give some unique vantage points, likewise shooting top down/overhead. \n\nTime of day is huge too. Golden hour and blue hour are some of the best times of day to get out and shoot, plus watching sunrises and sunsets are supposed to be natural stress relievers.\n\nSame, very very similar experience.\n\nWhat form of meditation do you practice?\n\nA while journey on mushrooms and LSD with meditation done that for me in just under two years, and I'm actually enjoying these benefits so much, I'm only 21 so I can't wait to see how much more I'll improve\n\nI got laid off in May and picked up a mindfulness-focused meditation app (10% Happier if you're curious) and have been practicing for somewhere between 30-60 minutes every morning all Summer. Can 100% corroborate your experience. Given the bit of time and space I had, I'm actually surprised how easy it's been to incorporate mindfulness &amp; loving-kindness practice into my daily life to the point where I really, really miss it if I don't get a 30 minute sit every day. The stillness I feel at the end of a sit is incredible.\n\nHave you noticed more positive emotions due to loving-kindness meditation?\n\nabsolutely yes. it's still early doors for me in terms of the number of hours under my belt, but I can definitely report more positive feeling and empathy towards both myself and others.\n\nThat's great. I've dabbled with loving-kindness but have mostly focused on mindfulness. I'll give it a try again.\n\nyeah, I've been on the mindfulness/equanimity tip lately but work in LK sometimes. I've enjoyed it. See if you can find any guided sessions from Sharon Saltzberg. She's great.\n\nI will thanks!\n\nFor me there's a connection to work for sure. In a period where I had no work, or was doing volunteer work or had small jobs maybe 3 times a week I felt so much closer to myself and calmer.\n\nDoing a full time job, especially with a computer is such a trip again... Add a wife and baby to the equation and there seems to be so many things pulling at me that I feel lightyears away from my former self that I had discovered through my practice years ago.\n\nThere are also other reasons for my deteriorated state but I do notice my mind wandering to the past and yearning for that peace and deep connection. I understand why monks lived without family ;) I love my wife and child and it's an experience I wasn't sure I'd ever make but it's certainly grounding and putting a clear focus on what you spend your energy on.\n\nI still benefit from my experiences and here and there I'm making discoveries internally again but it might be years before I can dedicate enough resources and create the circumstances for my inner development again.\n\nIt‚Äôs already internal growing. A lot of real guru‚Äôs developed this sense under a house, working and taking care of their children. Other part was on truly introspection with is only other path to the same place.\n\nYour life, in the way that it is already are prepared to teach you about spiritual growth\n\nOof how?\n\nI know some gurus that were householders, I don't doubt it's possible. Maybe it's that I'm dealing with lots of family related issues for the past years, that also affect my marriage. Sometimes it already takes so much energy just to function...\n\nI keep telling myself that I just need to keep on trucking and I try to give myself space to go easy on myself. That it's good enough to bring presence to every day situations. Still feels like a losing battle for the past couple of years, where I'm gradually losing my sense of self.\n\nMaybe I've already \"peaked\" and now it's time to make space for others ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\n\nI feel you! I‚Äôve been off work for the past couple months, which is the only reason Ive been able to do this deep dive. I wonder (worry! Lol) how it‚Äôs going to be once I go back full time next month. I almost feel frantic to meditate as much as possible before I no longer have the time! LoL\n\nIt's good you are aware of it. Better be realistic about it. I tried to maintain a serious practice and ended up hating myself for not being able to fulfil my unrealistic expectations...\n\nI hope you got over that! My moto is ‚ÄúI do what I can‚Äù. It‚Äôs all any of us can do. It saddens me when people don‚Äôt even do that. If you can‚Äôt maintain an inflated standard, alter your expectations. (Not raising or lowering, just altering.) As long as you‚Äôre taking more steps toward your ideal than back, you‚Äôre doing alright. It is never too late.\n\nDef. took lots of steps back I think. I mean when you spend lots of time on self development, reading, yoga, meditation, group events. And then you just can't keep it up... Now I don't even care that much about these things anymore. I think it comes from caring less about myself and in turn I care less about everything else. For I while I wondered if this is it. Did I reach some state of nonattachment? But I think it's something else :/\n\nIt is just a phase in your development. When you stop or lessen your practices, the benefits of what you have done are not negated. You are still better for having done them. \nBut that makes me think- if we can‚Äôt erase the good work we have done, can we negate the bad? Hm. \nBut it‚Äôs ok. The practices are still here for you, whenever you are ready. Remember that life runs in a cycle of ups and downs. All are to be expected. Our practices help us be ready for each phase as they come.\n\nThank you for the reminder and words of encouragement, it means a lot :)\n\nYou‚Äôre welcome. These words are as much for me as for you. These are things that I know, but I don‚Äôt know if I live them. The fact that it is what comes to mind is good I think.\n\nThanks for holding this space available for others while you are able to, it's a group effort üôè\n\nIf you are concerned about the cost of 10% happier, try Medito. It is free and becoming more and more comprehensive. 100% non profit. Good people!\n\n100 dollars for an app is crazy\n\n¬Ø‚Å†\\‚Å†_‚Å†(‚Å†„ÉÑ‚Å†)‚Å†_‚Å†/‚Å†¬Ø\n\ndoesn't really feel like to place to discuss the relative value proposition of paying for an app. I can count on one hand the number of apps I've paid for in my life and this one was an worth it for me, but you do you.\n\nedit: having had the experience of using it for the last four months, I'd gladly pay double\n\nThat‚Äôs valid. I can‚Äôt pay my rent rn so we obviously in different tax brackets regarding meditating\n\nSorry to hear about the cash flow sitch. Stupid cost of living results in a lot of suffering. If you're interested, I can DM you a code for a free month. Then if you think it's worth it  you get (I think) 50% off a subscription by converting to paid access. Also happy to suggest a course and a couple of one-off guided sessions that really communicated the value of having access to the full app to me. \n\nI even think the first course (8-10 sessions with Jonathan Goldman who started IMS) is free without a subscription.\n\nIndeed. I did 10%Happier at one time. It was decent. Then I discovered Medito. I love it.\n\nWhat kind of mediations are on medito? Just curious... What makes it worth the price for you?\n\nIt's free\n\nThe price is free, so it‚Äôs worth it to just check it out. Their mission is to spread the word and make the practice accessible to everyone. If you‚Äôre new, they recommend the intro course which explains the basics and different styles, which they have you try out. There are ‚Äúfriends of Medito‚Äù- well known / popular practitioners leading sessions. Meditations for stress, sleeping, pain, gratitude etc. Even a few in Spanish! There is a simple timer you can employ, background sounds and soothing music compilations. Even ‚Äústories‚Äù to help you get to sleep. \n\nEach morning I do ‚Äúthe daily‚Äù which is always a little different, with a choice of 3 voices and time durations- the quickest being 3 minutes, for those days you have to hit the ground running! \n\nThey also have a Telegram chat where they encourage suggestions. I‚Äôve only been doing this for like a month and a half. I recently asked for a search function so I could find some walking meditations. And today they added it! \n\nGood people, totally non profit and available to all.\n\nI spent 35 years meditating 2 hours a day. I see where you are and have been there. It is the first step in the right direction. Where you are is like the ground state. Now you can begin to build a new you and a new life from scratch, without all the BS. Explore your real passions, your real feelings, get out there and live life like a young child does without fear. Experience the pleasure and the pain. Bring the bliss you experience in meditation out into an active and fulfilling life. Being a hermit meditating in a cave is not living. It is only a means to an end, not an end in itself.\n\n\"Being a hermit meditating in a cave is not living.\"  \n  \nIt depends on the individual. Ramana Maharishi was living like a hermit and that was his preferred lifestyle. Osho lived like a king. They were both enlightened masters.\n\nMaybe it‚Äôs not possible to make an objective statement - there are certainly masters who have stayed for a considerable amount of time in a cave and can imbue great wisdom onto anyone willing to listen. But I‚Äôd say for the majority of people the objective is a deep engagement in life akin to what Graham was saying. This deep engagement in life is what becomes part of the meditation itself. And from another perspective this kind of life is also the true litmus test of your spiritual practice and progress.\n\nSounds good.\n\nwhat are you thoughts on making money?\n\nYou still have to do it because it's a part of life, just as you have to eat, drink and sleep.\n\nIf money didn't exist, you would need to hunt and forage to stay alive. Money is just a proxy for those things.\n\nIMO money is much more than just a proxy for those things. it is an anti-social force tearing the natural world apart and bringing together a new artificial world ruled by mammon worshippers and their tech. it is not just the love of money that is the root of all evil, it is money itself. before money you would have a real guru inspired by love of god/nature/truth. now you have a Youtube Guru inspired by clicks and who brags about not being with his dad while his dad is dying.\n\nYou could argue the tool that is money makes it relatively easier to accumulate wealth. However, I think corruption is a human condition that has been around for far longer than money has. History is filled with stories of corrupt gurus.\n\nThere are good gurus today as well, who are not motivated by money. Nothing new under the sun. The only thing that has changed is the mediums through which they operate (the internet vs. village centers, etc.).\n\nBeen working part time :)\n\nHow have you been affording to only work part time?\n\nYeah I'm interested in finding this out too. This friggin world won't let me be at peace. Money is essential to literally breath at times. Thefook!\n\nI am just starting my meditation practice, but Here‚Äôs my addition to the discussion.\n\ni think we should make money and our lives will be better with more money, so having more money as possible is preferable.\n\nbut is not essential, just a good mind is essential and all the rest is just secondary.\n\nfinally, I believe that we should be aware and not let things that should be moderately Preferred become an intense Yearning\n\nCan you share the ressource you use to learn meditation and yoga ? Thanks¬†\n\nThere is an online course called as Inner Engineering by Sadhguru. This is where I learnt most things. On top of that there are Isha teachers around the world where I learned something called Angamardana and Yogasanas.\n\nI've been doing his 15 minutes sadhana every morning for 3 years now.  He is onto something but it feels like work sometimes. I am not the body I am not even the mind.\n\nYeah turns out the art of meditation as it exists today with its many different variations and objectives has been around for thousands of years and there are dozens if not hundreds of reliable sources which cost NOTHING, Sadghuru, while being a  good channel for the dopamine addicted brain society we have today, is not the only source of information, please get informed and dont fall for the many Reddit marketing posts on this sub or similars, which look like a casual \"this is what i learned\" but are just a way to promote a course, book, etc.\n\nI was just looking at his website as I‚Äôm curious about this.  What is the cost?  How does this work?  I‚Äôm often a bit skeptical initially and want to consider this in a balanced way, and explore if this could be a good fit for me.\n\nSadhguru's a conman godman who allegedly murdered his wife, has political affiliations and claims he's enlightened and on a 10,000 year old project to build a magical statue with two of his mistresses. It's a cult and they brainwash people into servitude. Check OP's profile to get an idea.\n\nI remember hearing this, and there are a few 'gurus' to watch out for\n\nThank you for this info. I commented a moment ago asking you for this very information. I've considered taking his Inner Engineering course. Now, I'm certain I will. Thank you again!! I'm much encouraged.\n\nYeah.. what specific practices did you do ??\n\nOP mentioned Sadhguru, so that‚Äôs one place to start. That‚Äôs the name of a teacher, I believe he has some books and probably a website with the teachings\n\nHe's a conman godman who allegedly murdered his wife, has political affiliations and claims he's enlightened and on a 10,000 year old project to build a magical statue with two of his mistresses. It's a cult and they brainwash people into servitude.\n\nAll you need are the Books \"The Untethered Soul\" and \"Living Untethered\" EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW is there. Don't buy anything else. The stillness, your whole self, the real you, and the soul are already there waiting for you to sit and quiet down. Watch Michael Singer on Youtube. There is a highest truth in all of this and it is very simple. Because it is an absolute truth you can have it without techniques or religious stuff. Those things lead you to it but there are so many doorways and paths to that truth of pure peace. But none of the doorways or paths are the destination, they point you there. Those books above and 10 minutes a day meditating on stillness, will send you like an arrow directly to what you are looking for...The peace which surpasses all understanding is available for you to experience. It is meant for you to experience.\n\nThanks you, is there an order to read these books ? \n\nwhich type of meditation should I do ?\n\nNot looking to you as a doctor, but you may have similar context from which to relate.\n\nI‚Äôm bipolar, and it‚Äôs gotten a lot worse in the last 3 or 4 years. The outcomes you describe sound like an oasis of reprieve.\n\nAre there any resources you could point me towards that you found useful in the foundational steps you took? I‚Äôm not sure whether the previous affects how you‚Äôd answer that general question so may have been unimportant words‚Ä¶\n\nTL;DR Am nuts. Where did you start?\n\nI‚Äôve been using the app Healthy Minds to learn how to meditate the last 6 months and it‚Äôs been amazing! It‚Äôs free, no ads, really educational too.\n\nI love Healthy Minds!\n\nI have been using Medito for the past month (also free) And after a lifetime of struggling with profound ADHD, I‚Äôm starting Neurofeedback on Monday. Wish me luck!\nI was turned onto it via a book called ‚ÄúInto the Magic Shop‚Äù by James Doty. Life changing!\n\nGotta get back to the meditation! This motivated me\n\nBeen practicing Shambhavi Mahmoudra Kriya here for 4+ years. have experienced all of the same and so much more!!\n\nI've had a very similar experience following practices from Sadhguru. The most impactful was when, like yourself, I was doing 4+ hours of sadhana everyday. I was very happy and felt free at that time. \n\nAs my life has changed and I no longer have that much time to spare the acute benefits have faded. I still practice 1+ hours a day but I'm not nearly as light and joyful.\n\nI'm curious, have you ever decreased your practices yet maintained the benefits? I ask because I only kept up 4+ hours for a couple of months and wonder if keeping it up for longer results in more permanent effects.\n\nSome things stick even with less time dedicated. But some things will also be less. Fx the pleasantness you feel in the body after yoga will not be there if I don't do the yoga. But most things I have described here in the post is present always even with less time for practices on certain days.\n\nThank you for this post! I'm sure what you've wrote will help impatient beginners on the path of meditation. Real results come after months, if not years, of persistent meditation. It's very rare to find one with enough desire and discipline to follow the path until it's fruition. \n\nIt's expected to see the real results after quite some time of effort, given that we hare so conditioned against meditation and internal life. We have been raised by school, which teaches (among other things) forced extroversion and dependence to authority. This is absolutely not needed in the pursuit of spiritual life, as one is expected to be his own teacher (independent in learning and acquiring skills) and be interested in internal life (something we have had when we were young).\n\nI have some experiences and achievements in *mettƒÅ* meditation. My anger had been drastically reduced, my lust also (I have been suffering so much for being lust after woman). My brain functions so much better and my mental issues have dissipated. I worry less and have more introverted life. I enjos nature more and the external world looks better (colors are more vivid and bright). These are some of the results of *mettƒÅ*. \n\nMay you be happy on your path and advance until enlightenment!\n\nThank you. All the best to you too\n\nI learned that I could make myself have a dmt like trip....only happened 2 times, but boy it was a doozy...I blasted off into the sky\n\nHow did you do that\n\nI was using headphones with binural beats to get my brain into different states , like alpha,  beta, and  theta. When you get to a rem cycle of sleep , that's when things happen\n\nThank you. Hearing the term \"binural beats\" for the first time. Can you please share pointers? I can google, but would rather want to learn about it from someone who has the experience\n\nLike the reply below,  use headphones and youtube binural beats. For me it really helped me open my 3rd eye. I just focus on the patterns that form when my eyes are closed, gets me in a trance like state\n\nInteresting! So basically just listening, and meditating on the patterns that form with your eyes closed? \n\nDo you have any binaural beats you‚Äôd recommend?\n\nYa, that's basically it. I use this myself. It's very basic , not very musical or anything, but it does the job of getting my brain in those meditative states\nhttps://youtu.be/HePF0xlKzNE?si=kwp2emF7j2Dy2O9D\n\nThere are some studies that show you can affect your brainwave patterns by playing certain frequencies of sound into the each ear. You need headphones. Just go to YouTube or Spotify. Most people have very mild experiences with them if anything at all, but it's cool in theory and can be relaxing\n\nWhere can I learn more?\n\nI guess kundalini yoga can also make you trip too, but I'm not into yoga myself,  but I have thought about giving it a try.  But it's basically all in your breathing is what it comes down too. Your breathing activates the paneal gland. \nhttps://www.thepath.com/blog/2024/3/13/what-is-dmt-breathwork-what-it-is-amp-why-you-should-try-it\n\nAbout 8 years of consistent meditation practice here. Life changer. My anxiety and quick temper are gone.\n\nHi. My mind won't shut up with negative thoughts when doing things I used to enjoy. Throughout the day too it won't be quiet. Not necessarily negative talk but constant gibberish. When I try to make my mind go blank when meditating (I've just being meditating for a few weeks) it won't shut up either. To be honest it's beginning to really drive me nuts. Any advice would be appreciated.\n\nDont beat your self up over it. \n\nYou could set the intention of simply watching the brain, dont fight it, just be aware of the thoughts, dont chase them, maybe try counting them, watch them come and then go, pay attention to the energy in the thought, is it nervous? angry? or good? Whats the underlying energy in the thought? is it an emotion, can you connect and focus on that emotion? \n\nImagine your brain like it is the sky, each though a cloud passing by. The intention you set before meditating is to take a conscious break from all the mental chatter. \n\nYou could also focus everything on something, like your breath, or the things you hear, or see, the feel of the seat.\n\nTry a different meditation style like vipassana, or a mantra. Give your brain something to focus on. Trying to go straight to no thoughts is like trying to run a marathon with no training\n\nYou should avoid trying to force your mind to go blank, that can be detrimental both during an after practice. It‚Äôs better to just let the thoughts be thoughts, while placing your attention on whatever the focal point is for your practice (breath, mantra, mandala, etc). This will help you develop a deep restful focus and better acceptance of your own mind. These things allow you to achieve even deeper meditative states.¬†\n\nHave you tried the guided meditations on YT?\n\nHas it killed / lowered your desire for intimacy / libido ?\n\nThese things have gone down a little bit. But mostly it has become easier to ignore these aspects. The compulsive force has reduced for sure, but that doesn't mean the longing for imtimacy is not there at all.\n\nIs this what you have experienced?\n\nNope... I just wanted to know if OP has experienced anything like this.\n\nI‚Äôve been meditating for about 10 years now and have experienced similar insights\n\nThats great :)\n\nAre you having fun?\n\nThis what I feel. Like my mind is constantly preoccupied and I can‚Äôt be in the moment. My thoughts always racing and thinking about the next thing on my to do list. When I do meditate it forces me to slow down a bit which I really appreciate. Being in constant practice of meditation without meditating is my life long goal!\n\nGreat post.\n\nTy :)\n\nMy question is how did you have the time to do this?\n\nAny visions? Increase in Intuitions ? Improvement in memory or intelligence?\n\nBeautiful. You‚Äôve inspired me to take this moment that I have to be still with myself. Thank you for sharing - a game changer for me is when I run/lift weights is not having any music or stimulation. Just myself and my thoughts, a great way to sneak in another 30 minutes to an hour a day.\n\n:)\n\nThis is beautiful, I‚Äôve had a very similar experience.\n\nLearning the art of letting go has been one of the most challenging parts, and as a human, I still experience the ups and downs of emotions and situations that can be triggering and painful, but they‚Äôve become easier to navigate after many years of meditation, therapy, and yoga.\n\nThose moments of peace, of presence‚Äîare pure bliss.\n\nThe biggest finding for me is rather then money, I need more time in a day as I can do so much. I used to procrastinate a lot and now if I had to do something, I just do it.\n\nLove this post, thank you for sharing your experience.\n\n:)\n\nDude!! You're on your way to achieve what hindus scripture Vedas describes as \"Turiya\" state of mind. Keep doing it.\n\nToday I was thinking whom to ask this. But may be op can respond.\n\nI would say i started the meditation almost a year ago. But consistently i\"m doing since 4 weeks.\n\nI have feeling/understanding(mis) that I\"m still not reaching where i want.\n\nI always get into state where my entire body feels light but thoughts keep coming. Is this something one could say first stage of mediation or beginning. Because I ask myself what would be  thing which will motivate me to continue this. I started measuring my heart beat using various apps but none gave me a data which says it is working. But as i said, i want to know if there is something i can do improve it.\n\nPersonally, i feel proud that i\"m able to close my eyes and able to come to state where my body feels light.\n\nAnything you do closing your eyes will be helpful. But it may be that a more diciplined approach is needed in order to see real results. Picking up a proper practice and sticking to it every day for some time is best. I would go for a guided meditation like Isha Kriya and practice it 1-2 times a day for 40 days. ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwQkfoKxRvo )\n\nI‚Äôm just started learning meditation, it is very hard for me right now as my mind is racing crazy inside. ,millions of thoughts would jump here and there , most of the time my brain would leap into the visualization stage as well.i probably can only do 3mins.üòÆ‚Äçüí®. Also do you think meditation and manifest connects?\n\nI don't know about manifesting. I don't do it myself really. Best thing is to just ignore whatever happens in the mind and stick to a guided practice. It takes some time and practice to learn not to follow the mind everywhere it wants to go.\n\nI‚Äôve gotten to the same place through constant mindfulness. Great insights. Thank you.\n\nWonderful :)\n\nBeautiful! Thanks for sharing\n\n:)\n\nI started using headspace a good few years ago, unfortunatly couldnt keep up the practice but learnt many useful tips. Altogether i completed around 5000 hours in the space of around a year and when i started out i could not believe how hard it was to even sit for around 1min! I eventually built up to around 10 - 20min a day. The thing i found hardest even though i noticed the benefits to begin with and as you will all know there will be days where your mind is just non stop and your able to complete the practice feeling great that you was able to get past the frustration and involvement with whatever arises. But then it could be the next day or a week later and.. Nothing no real sensations or obvious thoughts occuring! For me that was really hard because i started to question the practice and worry that id stopped making progress and all of a sudden the boredom hit. I did not stop there but eventually gave in. One of the useful tips that did make sense to me at the time and i still try to keep in mind is that the practice is about effortless effort so although your doing something, your not actually doing anything. I am now looking to start building up my mindfulness practice again and have just started with breathing excercises instead which i feel suit me more because the effects are more noticeable and also there is that sense of controllability and actual consciesce effort so it is no way near as difficult as just well doing nothing. Anyone with any suggestions about the things that keep them motivated and actually stick to your practices id like to hear because i really struggle with consistency!\n\nI would recommend trying Isha kriya and sticking to it 1-2 times daily for 40 days. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwQkfoKxRvo\n\nI have just watched, not participated. To do that for 48 days twice daily or once a day for 90 days seems a hell of a commitment. I have been out of practice for many years and just knowing the lenght of time (3months)! Has just killed my motivation already. I really do appreciate fully the suggestion and i will keep this video saved in my watch later for the future.\n\nHow do you do 5000 hours in a year if that's like 13 hours a day. And you built up by doing 10-20 min.\n\nHow would you recommend a beginner to get started? I really feel like this is something I need in my life. Don‚Äôt know where to start.\n\nIt depends on you yourself as to what suits you and you will only really know with practice as to what works best. But as a starting point i would reccommend a very small amount of research as to what the actual benefits of things like mindfulness and meditation may have only to get an idea no need to do loads. Then i would get on youtube and search something along the lines of 5min guided meditation keeping it as simple as possible to begin and experimenting. Hope that helps\n\nI would recommend starting with Isha Kriya 1-2 times daily for 40 days. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwQkfoKxRvo\n\nThank you for sharing. ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\n:)\n\nThank you for sharing. I only have one question how can you afford to spend so much time practicing?\n\nWorking part time and just making it as the top priority.\n\nPlease tell me how to watch (meditate) hate or hurtful thoughts, memories.\n\nWhenever I get these types of thoughts I can't meditate and just get up.\n\nI would recommend trying a guided practice. Here it is not important what you think or feel. U just follow the instructions and ignore whatever is in the mind. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwQkfoKxRvo\n\nAny suggestions on how to get started with for physical and mental health?\n\nAgain I would suggest starting out with a guided meditation and doing that consitantly. If you want to take up a real commitment I would then recommend the Inner Engineering course by Sadhguru. 15 min guided meditation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwQkfoKxRvo\n\nThe inner sense of peace and being able to let go of your *problems* is a bliss. Being able to detach yourself from life illusions is something only meditation can teach you\n\nNice to hear your story. I also use yoga meditation for about 1 hour a day for the past 4 years and life has been changed for the better. To quiet the constant stream of thought is life changing. Today I am more at peace. I can also be more present in the moment and I can access pure awareness and even cosmic consciousness. It is a beautiful and wonderful thing. I also see joy in the simplest things like the sky or moon or trees. I‚Äôm less interested in material things. I feel more love and compassion for others than I did before. I will never stop meditating and seeking a personal relationship with God\n\n[removed]\n\nUnfortunately, your karma is too low to post.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Re: your first observation.¬†\n\nWhen did you begin to notice that you no longer needed to keep the mind occupied?\n\nMy mind still sometimes needs to be occupied with something, but the force that my mind has has gone down. If I want I can just sit and do nothing at all, which I do a lot. Fx it may be that just listening to music and watching the breath is all I want to do. For this to happen it took a lot of meditation practice.\n\nI instantly connected with how you have described your experience. There was a time I was in this state for few months but it went away. Not trying to chase it too hard, but I do wish to back in the that path.\nDid you experience ups and downs in your journey?\n\nDefinitely there has been huge ups and downs. As far as I understand it is part of the journey through your karmic cycles - meaning a meditator clears out a lot of junk within themselves faster than someone who doesn't do inner work. This can result in ups and downs greater than normal.\n\nHow do you meditate 5-6 hrs? Are Meditating instead of sleeping? Do you do breath work, body scan guided, other?\n\nWasn‚Äôt this posted somewhere already???\n\nI don‚Äôt have this much time per day, what is the minimum amount necessary you might recommend for a busy bee worker?\n\nIsha Kriya is 15 minutes. I would recommend trying this. it shd make a difference if u do it daily. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwQkfoKxRvo\n\nAnything helps. At first 5 minutes might feel hard. You do what you can and get the results.\n\nwow, 5-6 hours a day is something i can't dedicate in my regular life, kudos to you!\n\nVery interesting. I am experiencing something similar after daily workouts and taking proper supplements. Good workouts with proper breathing and supplements can do wonders. I can easily laugh at looking at anything. And there were days when I wasn't doing any workouts and it used to be horrible.\n\nHow much time do you spend meditating in a day?\n\nI find the  more I practice yogaa and meditate I am a.le to open the world beyond the view and take a peek.  I meditate just mearly a few minutes a day in the morning and sometimes in the afternoon.  It has brought peace of mind and yes it awakens you to your conscious and subconsciously mind\n\nWhat kind? Can you share routines?\n\nMy question is how much of your analysis of your experience was shaped by content that you engaged with surrounding meditation, yoga, and perhaps even Buddhism. It sounds like much of your experience has the buzz words and details that someone would tell you would happen if you engaged in these practices. Maybe it truly does have this impact, but more likely to at least some extent, your expectations of what it would do shaped your perceived experience and thus your takeaways.\n\n‚Äú a sense of abandon and desirelessness has come‚Äù made me smile ‚ò∫Ô∏è\n\nNot judging you but how do you get time for 6 hours meditation?\n\nThe privilege.\n\nYes it is very good. It makes us more centered.\n\nAfter about a decade of practicing meditation/mindfulness/compassion I have found meditativeness can be accessed even when you are not on the cushion. People don‚Äôt do things because they are vile they are simply working with their own internal dogma/ideology which has nothing to do with you at all. People are all the hero of their own story. People are all doing their best, their best may be awful, but this is because they are prisoners to their subconscious/conscious patterning not because of something personal towards you. Life is simply a play of forms, our lives in the grand scale although so precious are also conversely unimportant in the grand scheme and death is not a scary boogeyman to take you away but merely a change of form, as all things do with time. We are not our thoughts or our bodies, the personality we often associate as us we created from impressions of the past. It is just fiction and with skill we can craft a better fiction. A story we enjoy more. Our story is where the majority of our suffering comes from.\n\nThank you for sharing, I loved reading this. I have had some similar experiences, to a lesser degree, when I had a daily meditative practice. I have been meaning to get back to it; I think you just gave me the reminder and push that I needed!\n\nThe inner sense of peace and being able to let go of your *problems* is a bliss. Being able to detach yourself from life illusions is something only meditation can teach you\n\nI pray i live to experience this level of contentment &amp; happiness.\n\nThis is beautiful, thanks for sharing your journey. \nI‚Äôm walking on this journey, and it has been difficult to stick by it. Something always comes up which takes my mind off and I am in this state of ‚Äúaction‚Äù or ‚Äúgetting things done‚Äù. \n\nWhat were the initial easy sadhanas you tried when you started?\n\nThank u. I would recommend starting with this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwQkfoKxRvo\n\nI have had a very similar experience.  I feel a core calm and contentment daily.  I‚Äôm not as easily irritated and if I do get agitated I can recognize it and regain my composure fairly quickly.  I can handle conflict in a calm and kind manner.  \n\nI find more enjoyment in simple daily activities like walking in nature, cooking and eating, breathing fresh air, even cleaning (sometimes üòÇ).  \n\nMediation (and classical yoga) have been wonderful gifts that I now enjoy sharing with my private clients. And it‚Äôs a great privilege to hear them talk about how relaxed and peaceful the practices I guide them through make them feel.\n\n&gt; There is a whole inner world where one can access very blisful states.\n\nCan you expand upon this?\n\nI got caught up in spiritual bypassing\n\nFree 911 hour in the morning hour at night after 9:11 PTSD I used to read a lot now I have to use audiobooks because I can't concentrate\n\nI‚Äôve not tried an hour silent sit but I will do 20 min 3-4 times a week. I also practice half of the primary series in Ashtanga. I experience a lot of what you described. It‚Äôs helped my ADD and anxiety disorder to the point where I can function ‚Äúnormally.‚Äù Alongside this I‚Äôve learned about mindfulness and how to practice it in my everyday life. It‚Äôs a game changer for me. I don‚Äôt ever feel bored and I rarely feel lonely. Helps me be present with folks despite being in this noisy, noisy world we live in.\n\nHow did you find the time for that? Is my only question\n\nI would love to become this person. I only afford to do an hour a day at most.  But when I get into something and just let go of the Kaos, that is my thought process.  Built from years of practice.  I concur with your feeling of bliss. \nI feel like I don't have time for it.  But I also know that's not how life works . I know for this if I made time, I'd be more productive. I need this.  Thank you for your post.  It reminded me how important making time for myself is and how it won't get better without the conscious effort of making new habits.\n\nim 19 and very intrigued about everything that comes with meditation. I've been practicing mindfulness and being in that still moment as you mentioned, my question is, in that moment when eyes are closed what is that bliss, what is that feeling or state the keeps you there for an hour or so, what is actually going in the mind, is it complete zero state, or we're aware of our sensory organs, our breathing and all?

Fortunate to live close by. Weekly group meditation. I have done several retreats. Highly recommend. Did 10 days. Also short ones. So much drops away. Silence amazing. Outer world become louder. What is great is the opportunity for all to attend.  Scholarships and work retreats, if financial issues. not an ad, my personal experiences there.  ‚òÆÔ∏è\n\nI have to go back to meditation and yoga. My brain is a mess. Thank you for this hope. \n\nHelp me universe\n\nWow! Super inspiring to hear your story, I'm starting meditation and yoga for the same reasons as you have.\n\nAnyone have a good audio book or YouTube series to follow for mediation?\n\nHow on earth did you have time for 5-6 hours Yoga per day?\n\nGod is the nothingness between everything that becomes the everything between nothingness.\n\nHello, OP. First off, thank you so much for sharing your experience. It's incredibly encouraging for me. CAN YOU PLZ TELL ME IF YOU TOOK ONE OF THE CLASSES OFFERED AND IF SO, WHICH ONE?? I paid for and took the SKY meditation class through Art of Living and though it does help/work, my inner being is looking for more. Your state of mind has been my lifelong desire. I'm 59 yrs old, btw.\n\nWhen I was 68 I started working out with a fitness trainer three days a week l added three days a week pof yoga when I was 72. I‚Äôm 80 now and in excellent health and the breath part of yoga has led me to start meditation.\n\nHow do I get started?\n\nHow you started meditation? \nI try to do breathing exercise. Is it same as meditation?\n\nHow long did it take you before you started noticing results and how much time per day were you spending on it when you did? I've been doing ten minutes a day for a month and I don't notice anything, wondering if I'm just so spun up in my nervous system that I'm going to have to really commit to 20 minutes. Which to me, seems like a whole heck of a lot this early in.\n\nIt has taken away so much of my anxiety and stress...unbelievable.  I have been practicing over 20 years now and it still removes layers.  When I think about my life before, it is a total 180\n\nHow has it affected you in the \"real/practical world\"? Has it made work, life, chores, etc, different or difficult?\n\nFor about a month I too have been sitting on the mat in the garden and starting with pranayama and the asanas that I feel best to do for my body at that particular moment. I am lucky enough to live in a house in the city but with a garden with several trees so the air is very good compared to the city center. I noticed the connection between me and nature and the universe and everything that surrounds me, greater inner peace, acceptance of the inevitable bad weather of life, profound calm that starts from within and certainly other intuitions that are difficult to put into words.\n\nI got into yoga after my father passed away. I needed something!!!!!   And I was not going to go back to wine.\nWhen I relaxed the importance of these two practices, my life changed for ever. It's been 7 years continuing the practice and I won't look back.\nIt has inspired me to open up a yoga studio my self with my partner. \nWe work from home half the week and it can be chill, which is a fortunate thing. Even making time to do it for 5 minutes, here and there is important. \nSteady wins the race sometimes."

    "body": "After meditating I realized that there's no reason to do anything in life.  There's no reason to date, or get money, or try to find a hobby.  \n\nIt killed all sense of motivation &amp; drive in my life by making me at peace with myself.  This consequently led to me no longer working or hanging out with friends or talking to anyone.\n\nI have no desire to do anything anymore.  \nThe problem is, I wish I had desire, I wish I had motivation.  But meditation runs so deep, there is literally no reason to be doing anything in life anymore.  \n\nHow can I possibly get my motivation back, when meditation showed you that desiring things is pointless?  I will just spend next 70 years of my life, just sitting around not getting hobbies, or talking to people because meditation shows you don't need anything externally.  \n\nThe thing is in the past I had drive, even if that was just me desiring external materialistic things, I think I enjoyed life more when I had ambition.\n\n*****\n\n**Edit:** I been combative in the comments. Sorry I'm negative.  I'll take your guys advice. I went through 5 therapists and a psychologist and they didn't diagnose me with depression.  I also been non-respondent to antidepressants.

    "all_comment_text": "Reminds me of the old story about a young monk who was a student bent on learning how to foster equanimity.  One day he was sitting in his hut meditating durning a storm, when suddenly part of the roof caved in, letting water spill into the living space. \n\n An older wiser monk, seeing what had happened, approached the young monk, and asked why he had done nothing to resolve this situation. \n\n The young monk replied that he was developing his equanimity, and wanted to know how to accept situations as they came, and reality as it was. \n\nThe wise monk replied ‚ÄúWhat you are practicing is the equanimity of a cow. \nGo fix the roof‚Äù\n\nI noticed once I started meditating I became *more* frustrated when annoying stuff like that would happen. At first I thought that I was just noticing my frustration more, not actually getting more frustrated. There's still some truth to that, but I see now that I was actually resisting reality more by expecting myself to be perfectly equanimous when, for example, there was a leak in the house or the work at my job was more than I was expecting.¬†\n\nMaybe the real reality to accept was the need to act and the emotions/body sensations that would come about once I started.\n\nOnce I began allowing myself to feel the physical emotions rather than shame myself about them (‚Äúugh, you‚Äôre doing it again!‚Äù), I figured out how quick feelings are.  Once I let feelings flow, I realized even more deeply what they actually feel like when I remove the shame and fear I have *about* the emotions. That opened up even deeper understandings of why I react in the ways that I do.  Feelings become usable energy for me. I was afraid and ashamed of them without even understanding that.\n\n\"ugh you're doing it again\" is a VIBE. Learning about the observer trap helped me through it!\n\nWow..nicely said ..an eye opener...haha.. equanimity of a cow ......\n\nThis reminds me of a story about this Zen student, who was at a monastery practicing long periods of sitting meditation..\n\nHe could feel his body start to swirl in a circular motion (I‚Äôve had this many times myself) \n\nSo he stopped his head and body  from swirling round and round then remembered his teacher saying ‚Äúresist nothing and go within‚Äù-\n\nSo he allowed himself to swirl around again as to ‚Äònot resist what is‚Äô \n\nThen his master hit him with a stick (not hard) just a jolt/ - ‚ÄúStop that‚Äù. \n\nSo he stopped- \n\nAfter the Zazen was complete he just had to know why he got tapped by master- \n\nSo waited for the right time to ask-\n‚ÄòWhy did you hit me? I did what you said!!‚Äô I stopped STOPPING myself spinning round to allow it to happen- this was your advice‚Äô? \n\nMaster simply said- ‚Äúwell I didn‚Äôt know‚Äù‚Ä¶. \n\nNot much of an explanation is it?haha- he wanted some profound explanation to move further into knowing‚Ä¶\nperplexed the student went away then later he realised something\n\n‚Ä¶. It didn‚Äôt matter. None of it mattered. \nThe stick,\nThe answer,\nThe spinning- all of it. \n\nHe was still trying stuff, needing explanations..  he finally learned the lesson. These things are trivial he no longer needs answers to anything.\n\n-Book I think is called -  \n‚ÄòIt isn‚Äôt so‚Äô \n\nOr something v similar.\n\nLove it, thank you\n\nI‚Äôm new to meditation and I‚Äôve been having a somewhat similar experience. \n\nI think it‚Äôs because in the past we wanted to do stuff to satisfy our ego, but now that we don‚Äôt care about that it all seems kind of pointless. I‚Äôm expecting this to be a transition phase into finding and getting used to new motivators such as compassion, curiosity, and interest.\n\nTransition phase is the transcendence phase \n\nOnce you experience ego death, even on a small scale you need to start moving back to We and away from I - there‚Äôs lots to live for, relationships for one, fulfilling our obligation to care, that don‚Äôt focus on our egos. Getting stuck a I and not being able to move to We is how nihilism is born\n\nThis is the answer. There's an awakening process OP is going through and it can be painful\n\nI like the last line\n\nLiterally this. Also maybe shit that doesn‚Äôt align with you is falling away from your life and you‚Äôre being redirected towards new habits, beliefs etc. It sounds like you‚Äôre kinda resisting that process and honestly I dont mean this in a rude way but get over yourself and surrender.\n\nLol I needed to read this. I actually stopped recently because ego was slipping away and I have no idea who I am anymore. Get over myself is so blunt and funny to me, but exactly what I needed to hear. Thank you!\n\nYes yes YES üôå\n\nSpot on.\n\nYou‚Äôre almost there, compassion + curiosity + acceptance = letting go\n\nIt's this exactly.  Op look at my last post I made\n\nyeah it sounds like fried dopamine receptors to me bud :)\n\nEven if the ego deludes us. I believe I had more fun living with a purpose (even if my purpose is a delusion)  Knowing it's a delusion did not give me relief. It honestly got me stuck in limbo, feeling like I shouldn't even leave the house anymore.\n\nThis sub will tell everyone that this is a good thing, and this is what real happiness is...  \nI don't know what koolaid other people are drinking where they think this is a superior way to live.\n\nRemember when you were a kid and you did things because they were fun? Start doing shit that is fun, that you are curious about, and that is in some way a way to self-express.\n\nI became a composer. I taught myself how to make music at 46. Now I make weird experimental and sci-fi synth music. \n\nI also started playing around with generative AI, again because it's fun, and I was curious. I began to write as well, not necessarily to become some famous author, but to simply get some ideas down, and see what weird shit my mind can come up with. Now I'm drawing again. I haven't done that since I was in college.\n\nWhat did you always want to do when you were younger, or what was the thing that you put aside to be an adult? Do that now.\n\nThe key is self expression, and doing something that is aligned with your inner self...your inner voice. What is that voice telling you that you should be doing now? Do that.\n\nLove this!! I‚Äôve been obsessed with music my entire life. I‚Äôve been thinking a lot about trying to create music. I like to write lyrics and would love to make music. It would be just for myself as a way to express myself and follow that inner child yearning. I don‚Äôt even know where to get started though\n\ndownload a free daw like reaper (or set yer sails, whatever you prefer), watch a basic tutorial on how to use it and then just start fucking around with it. there's tons of free samples online so you really have everything you need to start. just make whatever you feel like at first and then, if you wanna get more serious, you can get into more advanced songwriting, mixing, mastering etc.\n\nthe one thing you'll have to do if you want your stuff to actually sound good is to learn some basic music theory. i struggle with it myself but the fundamentals can be picked up through just one or two youtube videos, there's tons of them out there. \n\ni strongly recommend you give it a try. you have literally nothing to lose and if you already have a love for music, it'll give you a whole new perspective on it while also being really fun\n\nReaper might overwhelm a complete beginner. Better to go with Garageband or maybe Mixcraft if on a PC imo. Good luck to OP.\n\nI did this 3 years ago when I bought a MIDI controller for the kids off the Internet by accident. I thought it was a child's toy keyboard but it was actually a portal into a world I had never knew existed. The controller came with a free DAW called MPC2. With a DAW you can create a song from start to finish and make it sound professional, all from the comfort of your home. You don't need any instruments except for a microphone if you want to record vocals. Now I knew absolutely notheling besides the basic music lessons id had 30+ years ago but that was it. Now I make music almost everyday. Just for me. I put it on the Internet but nobody cares and that's just fine. Highly recommend it as a form of self fulfillment.\n\nDon't worry, I have been doing this for 12 years now, making stuff for myself or even spending time on DAWs, even bought an MPC 500 that I never did anything with.\n\nMidi Controllers and a Daw is all we need these days.\n\nI‚Äôve only just started to do this (in my 50s). Never too late.\n\nI felt like this for a while and still do at times, but it‚Äôs only because you‚Äôre breaking away from life as you knew it. Maybe you‚Äôve realized that your current life wasn‚Äôt really fulfilling outside of paying bills and now you‚Äôre in a transition phase. Once you find the true beauty in nature, animals, and other people, life will be more beautiful and purposeful. That takes time. I‚Äôm honestly having a hard time living in my current reality but I‚Äôm trying to look at it as a process. The more I meditate, the more I see the beauty in our world. I‚Äôm having severe ups and downs but I don‚Äôt for one second wish that I could go back to the mundane way of thinking I had before. Our purpose is to have a human experience and grow our soul, which is happening at every moment. Know you‚Äôre not alone in this way of thinking and I hope it gets better soon.\n\nThe nothing matters is also an ego thought just on the other end.  Ego is devious and coopts many genuine things.  Meditaton should lead to equanimity and non judgemental peace in the present moment, not absolutes about the world.  I'd encourage you to get out of your thoughts and into living with more embodied practices like yoga or breathwork, or by avoiding meditation and returning to the gym and social life etc.  Or find some good content from teachers on nonattachment and nihilism.  Good luck!\n\nI promise you that this is transitional. You will find purpose again, and this time, it will be clear. I no longer use action to satisfy myself, and instead, I now revel in the joy of little things, community, and leadership. I recommend finding community. For me, it was running, since it's moving meditation.¬†\n\nThat‚Äôs not a good thing. Sounds like depression, not meditation. Our very existence could be a delusion. Might as well make the most out of it with the brief time you have here instead of being fearful of it.\n\nIm not gonna tell u this is what happiness is but i will tell you it is good, and you are now capable of feeling better than before you just gotta learn how a new way cause things clearly aren't what they appeared to be nor do they always work how we think they do whether it feels good or not, your are now living a more real version of life your life experience is now more real so now the way you interact with the world  can change You can have more in depth experiences your can love deeper than ever before you now have more control over the quality of your experiences because your perspective has grown now it's just a matter of kinda re training your brain with this new interface it's like your downloading the newest software and u used to be an old pos computer, it might take a second for everything to download and if there is a component of u that is faulty the software will not fully install, if there is a part of u that isn't there with the rest of u yet it could impede growth make it hard to grow so now go learn how things really work how life and the world really works since none of it is like we thought it was   the Knowing what you believed may have been a delusion is not bad it is actually good because now you see the world more for what it is than What you thought it was now it is time too learn more about reality because clearly it is not what we thought it was, u gotta build a new perspective after realizing these things and come to\n\nIt clearly is a good thing for a lot of people. Maybe you need to stop? Maybe it's not for you?\n\nOps ego is still at play.¬†\n\n100\n\nThe inherent dissatisfaction of not feeling driven should make you feel driven again but now from a place of detachment\n\nNow you have the freedom to choose your purpose.  I meditate to help me focus, so I can chase a purpose.\n\nIt's called life and it doesn't have a purpose, when you put the ego aside. You chose, what your ego is gonna entertain and what not.\n\nThere is no reason to do anything, but there is also no reason to do nothing.\n\nIf you have no desire to do anything in order to seek gain and benefit yourself then why not start doing things for the sake of others?\n\n[deleted]\n\nI‚Äôve found Absurdism to be a good companion to my meditation path. We essentially force ourselves to confront the absurd, what OP is doing now, and must choose how to move forward in life once we have. Of the three choices Camus presents us, the ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù one is to rebel against the absurd and make our own meaning and happiness despite knowing that in the end our actions are futile.\n\nPlease keep in mind that the modern ‚Äúsecular‚Äù practices of ‚Äúmindfulness meditation‚Äù and various derivations from it are actually just a tiny bit of a part of Buddhism. Trascendental tiny bit, but nothing more than a cog in a whole system.\n\nThis is the answer, and this is why meditation is so powerful.\n\nThis is very important to point out and I think is actually the big trap when approaching meditative practices. I fell into this nihilism trap when I was starting meditation in college and I abandoned my practice almost completely for the next 10 or so years. I began again in my late 20s and have had my practice going for well over 10 years now. \n\nIt‚Äôs very easy to confuse the emptiness of self with the nonexistence of self. The latter is an extreme view that leads to nihilism. At least in the Buddhist traditions I‚Äôm aware of, nihilism is a wrong view and the teachings are explicitly not nihilistic.\nYet it‚Äôs exceptionally easy to get confused and fall into it if you‚Äôre just meditating without any real notion of what the teachings are. All the corporate ‚Äúmeditate for productivity‚Äù that has invaded the dialogue in the west I find at least misguided, and at the worst actually harmful.\n\nIn Buddhism nihilism is one dualistic extreme, the other being eternalism. In the nihilistic view after death we are extinguished forever, and in the eternalist view we have a soul that goes on forever. Neither of these are considered correct in Buddhism. The teaching is a middle path between dualistic extremes.\nThere is a sutra that actually addresses nihilism, as it was a view that some schools of thought taught at the time of the Buddha. \n\nHe considered it to be wrong view, a denial of the results of good or bad actions (karma) and rebirth. With the teachings on emptiness in the heart sutra it states all phenomena are marked by emptiness, ‚Äúno birth no death, no being no nonbeing, no defilement no purity, no increasing no decreasing‚Äù. So nihilists would be led to cling to the view of nonbeing and not see everything else. For me at least that brought about a lot of aimless suffering. \n\nWhat I am saying is this happens to a lot of practitioners that have a good sitting practice but are absent of Dhamma/Buddhist Teachings. I hope you find a way through. DM me if you have further questions. May you be happy and may you be free from suffering u/ayyzhd \n\nI also recommend this sutta [Apannaka Sutta: A Safe Bet translated from the Pali by Thanissaro Bhikkhu](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.060.than.html)\n\nthankyou\n\nYou mention buddhism, karma and rebirth.  \n\nSomething I don't understand about karma is. You're never really safe are you?  You can do right in this life, reincarnate and then in next life you do evil things because you were put into an evil environment. Thus dooming you to hell.  \n\nOur actions are influenced by our environment.  \nYou raise a dog to fight other dogs, and now that dog will have bad karma dooming it to hell.  \nNothing is safe from eternal suffering.\n\nThat's a way to see it... is it eternal suffering if your consciousness is wiped clean and you start each life with a blank slate? It would be eternal suffering if the person was eternal as well...\n\nHonestly, practicing balance in everything (I believe) is key.\n\nI prefer to look at the yin-yang symbol and relate it to anything in life (or death).\n\nThere's always a good side, there's always a bad side.\n\nThere's always something good that inherently came out of the bad, there's always something bad that came out of the good.\n\n‚òØÔ∏è\n\nWith that being said, being \"bad\" or \"evil\" as a characteristic of one's behaviour must've somehow served a purpose (whether big or small).\n\nAnd if you look outside of \"karma\" and karmic cycles, you might see that purpose serve in other people's soul contract/what they came here to do/to experience.\n\nI'm not advocating for suffering or evilness or anything that stands against human rights by inflicting pain on purpose to someone else (and never will), however the word pain is something we can't NOT have if we want to experience joy and has to be discussed seperate from the word suffering.\n\nHow does one know what day is if they never experienced night? How does one know what \"hot weather\" is if they never felt the crispy chilliness in autumn or winter? In that same matter, we live in a time-space reality where one of the laws of this reality is this dualistic experience where one must feel/know the opposite form as well as the current form, to better understand that form.\n\nAs for safety - you are as safe as you allow yourself to be. Personally, I found resources that complement each other and have made me, in time, experience greater levels of safety. So, if safety isn't something you deeply feel, why not look for other forms of meditetions or practices or resources to even know what a greater level is? Again, one doesn't know what safety is until they've experienced unsafety. But to what extent you feel safe depends on how far you've experienced this feeling.\n\nAs for Karma,\n\nJust because X did this horrible thing in said lifetime, doesn't mean karma will bite them in the a** in that lifetime (or another) necessarily.\n\nI believe more in the \"karmic\" yin and yang, nothing is truly just black or white, one way or the other.\n\nSo I, for one, don't think karma is attached to you forever and that if you did X horrible thing it's tattooed on your forehead for life &amp; all possible reincarnations after that, to the extent that you are doomed just by reincarnating and then end up thinking \"what the hell is the purpose anyway if I'm going to hell each time?\"\n\nThere are many tools that talk about karma, including akashic records which accesses your past lifetimes. At most you will find lifetimes where X,Y,Z event occurred and might've blocked your chakras reaaaal well. This doesn't mean that in the next life you dont have a chance of clearing your energy blocks, living more in the present moment, suffering less, feeling more fullfilled or at ease with life, enjoying greater love or peace, etc.\n\nDoes this make sense? Shoot me a message if you have questions or want to go in further detail about it.\n\nBut in case you are a visual person - just gonna throw this out here - Teal Swan is the best person I've found at explaining this (you can even search some of her older videos on karma, cause she will 100% sure have videos on the exact question you had)\n\nPlus I want to add something else too: i believe karma is more an energetic attachment that one didn't process at all in a certain event, then an adjective to be used by others, in other people's perceptions. \n\nFor example:\n\nA. X person accidentally killed someone. That guilt and suffering on top of the already existing grief, could go unprocessed properly for a whole lifetime. \n\nLet's say they reincarnate as a human again. This time, it's not stamped on their forehead \"Because of what YOU did in this lifetime, you shall suffer in this one too\". \"You shall live in a crappy environment, blame your circumstances, and never ever exceed them.\" \n\nAt most they could have repeated lessons, maybe a very blocked heart chakra that - for example - manifests as fear of falling in love so as to not hurt the other person (kinda like how the victim from our previous step was also hurt by X). \n\nBut each time you reincarnate, you still have the chance of clearing the blockages, learning to navigate life smoother, surfing easier wheneve life's waves are bigger, etc etc. \n\nBasically, X person in the 2nd lifetime could have learned to process emotiosn better, shift perspectives of certain events better (to suit them, not to make them suffer more), change beliefs around a certain thing, etc etc. \n\nThat's example A. üòÇüòÇ\n\nExample B:\n\nLet's take Suzie this time. Suzie is a big time researcher and scientist. She spent her whole life studying how to cells multiple and what happens to an organism in the event of a disease such as cancer. \n\nShe has devoted her time, energy, and possibly money to pursue a lifelong goal: be one of the scientists that makes a huge discovery in the medical field. \n\n40 years later (of work and research) she finally succeeds: together with her team she finds a rare bush in the forests of Columbia that has a specific seed that, when eaten ripe, reverses cancer effects in a human body. \n\nSuch a breakthrough is easily named one of the biggest most important breakthroughs in medicine in all of 21st century, right? \n\nWell, here's that yang to the yin‚òØÔ∏è  most people don't see üëâüèº those bushes, because of how recent they've been found, can't yet be replicated and technology to do so far exceeds current human technology.\n\nThose bushes are also a key part of the ecosystem of the forest in that country at large as well. \n\nBecause humans need the seeds, those bushes will be heavily exploited, not only impacting the price of the seed when used as medicine for a cancer patient, but also entirely destroying a specific species of animals that lives off of that seed. \n\nWith less bushes and seeds, that animal goes entirely extinct. \n\nAt a glance, Suzie and her team were \"good people\" who did \"good deeds\". \n\nBut at large... 2-3.. 5 generations later, the impact of the disruption in the ecosystem that occured, left some animals extinct, cause a decrease of vital resources for both humans and all species they live with, and in turn resulted in horrific events. (You can add any example here - shortage of food, globak starvation that killed millions, polution that did xyz). \n\nThose generations will remeber Suzie as the scientist that destroyed half the forestry and animal ecosystem of the world.. cause she wasn't smart/resourceful/good enough to 3D print those seeds. \n\nBut the truth is, that 3D printing technology came much later as a solution to the already created problem. \n\nWhat I'm getting at here is that good/bad can be too subjective to think that it would affect your quality of life in the next reincarnation. \n\nYou can be good in some people's eyes, and totally evil in other's. \n\nYou can solve a pressing problem for humanity now, and still create a huge problem for humanity later üòÇ. \n\nI believe your karma is not influenced  by how other people perceive and interact with you (cause they'll do it in all kinds of ways), but more so of how you carry yourself - did you think you had a good meaningful life, filled with amazing moments, people, and relationships? Did you feel good about discovering those seeds that NOW could save millions of people who die young from cancer? Did you have a nice, full, well-rounded life marked with mostly great feelings? Or where there any strong pressence of grief/anger/sadness/despair/etc that heavily impacted you but went unprocessed for the rest if your life, and therefore made life crappy overall?\n\nDoes this make sense? üòá\n\nYes nothing is safe from suffering, that is the fundamental beginning of buddhist practice.  However, karma is essentially cause and effect.  Regardless of the unfairness of the universe, when we cultivate good actions in ourselves, the world - and ourselves with it - benefit.  This is the fundamental choice to act for good despite the suffering that I think may answer your present lack of purpose.  Every moment contains the possibility to be aware of our existence honestly and to meet it in all its ugliness and beauty with gratitude grace and compassion.\n\nMotivation fades when you see through illusions. But action isn't about need; it's about expression. Find something worth doing, not for gain, but to express who you truly are.\n\n&gt;Find something worth doing, not for gain, but to express who you truly are.\n\n‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nüëèüèª‚ù§Ô∏è I needed to read this\n\nThis isn't a byproduct of meditation, you sound genuinely depressed. I hope you reach out and get some help because you need to talk to someone about this.\n\nI came here to say this. OP is likely not aware to the extent they are depressed and shifting blame to \"successful meditation\" so as to avoid the root of the depression\n\nDark side of meditation is a real thing. One of the reasons I recommend people to *not* attempt to use meditation as medicine is precisely because it has very *strong* contraindications or side effects. \n\nPersonally, mediation has helped a lot with meaning and trauma. Knowing that I can at any point in time observe and fully experience the most banal of experiences calms me. But not everyone is left with that effect. I think it is dangerous to have naive viewpoint that any negative effects of meditation is \"not from meditation\" or that \"you are not doing it right\". \n\nBut, I will say this; mediation made me aware of how depressed I actually was. That was, in it self, heartbreaking. The feeling that I was not my self, or half self, was crushing. But I anchored myself in job, working out and reading. Stamina and routine got me out of it. I think it is in part chemical change that needs to happen and making some fundamental changes to your life that changes your outlook and lived experience(it is a circle, but you have to start somewhere).\n\nHope you pull through OP, and that you give yourself the time to heal.\n\nMy yoga professor in college had us meditate, and honestly since that experience I‚Äôve been scared to actually meditate. I experienced psychological stress while meditating, and I feel relieved by your comment seeing it‚Äôs a real thing.\n\n&gt;I think it is dangerous to have naive viewpoint that any negative effects of meditation is \"not from meditation\" or that \"you are not doing it right\".\n\nI don't think that that's what they are trying to say. Not that OP is \"meditating wrong\" or something -- just that they clearly have something deeper going on.\n\nI personally think that what OP is experiencing is a sign that they should stop meditating for sure, but I don't believe that meditation in itself is the cause (as they seem to believe).\n\nIt's dangerous when people tell folks to keep meditating through situations like this -- no they should not! Many people have gotten hurt due to this viewpoint.\n\nBut I also feel resistant to assertions that meditation is inherently dangerous. I guess there are probably meditation practices I'm not aware of, but I don't see how simply observing yourself is unsafe unless there is some other factor that put you at risk.\n\nIt reminds me of people who say it's \"unsafe\" to sit on an airplane without looking at your phone watching a movie or reading a book. like somehow going without stimulation or distraction for any length of time is dangerous.\n\n&gt;It reminds me of people who say it's \"unsafe\" to sit on an airplane without looking at your phone watching a movie or reading a book. like somehow going without stimulation or distraction for any length of time is dangerous.\n\nWait what? There are actually people who claim that's unsafe? Must be ironically no?\n\nI would say I got less social with other people after doing meditation every day for 30 days. So, yes, there is definitely a dark side to it.\n\nExactly. I could only bear the weight of meditation _after_ I healed from my traumas.\n\nWhat did you read and what was your routine? Did you have therapy and medication? \nI‚Äôm starting to realize I may be more depressed than I thought I was, and I really want to pull myself out of this hole that keeps sucking me back in\n\nyup it is NOT because of mediation, there are deeper issues.\n\nWhat?? And Why so many likes?? What op wrote is something more frequent on meditation than people think.\n\nIt's absolutely a frequent byproduct of meditation.\n\nI'd argue it's not a byproduct, as much as it is meditation working as intended. It may lead to greater attunement with thought processes which could be a pretty intense experience if this is the first time they've really tried to make a deliberate effort to process their thoughts rather than repress them. It seems like OP might just be discovering their true values are not the ones they always thought and is going through an adjustment period, possibly mood disturbances.\n\nThe thing is, I tried going to doctors and tried meds and none of that worked.  They didn't even diagnose me with depression. I didn't respond to meds or therapy.  The therapist only diagnose me with autism &amp; ADHD.  \n\nI only lost my motivation after meditating.\n\nGoing through something similar in my own experience too. Waiting on gene testing to see what‚Äôs up with my brain chemicals and how we fix em. It‚Äôs been a 10 year journey with different meds and doctors and therapists, the whole run around. Don‚Äôt make it your fault, okay? It‚Äôs already hard enough on its own. \n\nMost likely mediation gave you more time to witness how you already feel. Don‚Äôt give up hope, okay? Do the stuff you love, watch movies you cherish, listen to albums, etc. This isn‚Äôt forever, and will pass too.\n\nThis sounds like derealization and it points not to meditation but your intuition telling you that you need to deal with something that is blocking you from choosing to live this life now and be present. Saying ‚Äúmeditation did this to me‚Äù isn‚Äôt exactly accurate. You must have come to some realization about yourself or your circumstances that caused some kind of ontological or existential reaction. Talking about that specifically may be helpful. I am neurodivergent. My child is neurodivergent.  We see, feel and perceive things differently. As such maybe if you got these diagnosis then there‚Äôs maybe even some unacknowledged trauma from childhood related to this as well. \n\nIt‚Äôs not meditation that causes this it‚Äôs the realization existentially that you are not your physical body and that there is more to this all. \n\nMeditation is the time that you have to settle your mind and body. It‚Äôs when the mind is undistracted that the peace can finally come. If you are finding after this that life is pointless then there is more to the reason you came to that conclusion then just the mere act of meditating. What other sites are you reading? What was your initial reason for meditating? These are important questions.\n\nIf you have ADHD I presume you're currently being affected by the worldwide shortage of medication? Could this be a factor?\n\nI don't think ADHD is related here.  \nI feel like I'm not connected to the world anymore, and i can't relate to anyone or anything anymore.  \n\nThe more I learn, the less I feel motivated to do anything.  \nFor example, when you meditate you learn everything is fake.  \n\nSo when you talk to someone, you know the person you're talking to is fake, and the stuff they talk about is just their ego running.  Which makes it completely uninteresting to engage in those conversations anymore.  \n\nI feel like I am dissociating from life after meditation.\n\nCurious as to how old you are? In my mid twenties I went through an existential crisis like this.\n\nJust keep pushing. My life changed drastically when I finally came out the other side and I can confidently say that I‚Äôm the happiest I‚Äôve ever been.\n\nIt‚Äôs part of our experience on earth and everyone goes through this at times.\n\nTake it as a sign to pursue new things and assign new meaning in life through mindfulness while exploring the world in a manner that allows you to learn about yourself.\n\nYou‚Äôre searching for purpose\n\nThis honestly doesn't sound like the meditation, maybe the timing makes it look that way. \n\nWhy did you start meditation? Was your mental state already starting to suffer for you to start thinking about wanting to meditate? Where you subconsciously looking for a coping mechanism?\n\nThese are all textbook symptoms of depression, I know you've said you have spoken to a doctor but I really implore you to speak to a different one, you've said you're resistant to the meds but that happens a lot, it's simply a case of finding which meds or coping mechanisms will work best for you. Please seek help.\n\nHave you ever heard of Optimistic Nihilism?  \n  \n \"Optimistic nihilism is **the realization that the lack of meaning in the world and the universe as a whole can be liberating**. Precisely because there is no inherited meaning in life. There is no cosmic plan forcing you to act a certain way. We are the ones who can create our own path.\"\n\nThis is the philosophy I follow, I know life has no intrinsic meaning, so why not have fun and do whatever the hell you want?\n\nInteresting. I personally never heard of this. I am somewhat nihilistic but I always associated it with negativity. I always felt there was a positive side to all of this, but I didnt know there was a term for it. Mostly because the media paints nihilism as a negative thing.\n\nnow you know\n\nThis is somewhat similar to Absurdism\n\nDark night of the soul. Took me about 10 months to get through a similar experience. Doing great now though.\n\nIt feels so relatable.\n\nI moved from my parents house and now I live alone.  \nI don't have a relationship, even though I want I'm not good at this.\n\nI have an IT job and i realised that I don't need to give my best because nothing really matters and even if you give your best, it doesn't mean you're getting anywhere.\n\nI used to do a lot of things. To draw, to create small creative projects, watch movies, animes, read books and magazines. I used to play a variety of video games and go out with people from college and work.\n\nI'm 28 right now and I feel I don't have a desire for anything new. Kind of lost the interest in people because of the same reasons you said. Kind of everything is fake and so why am I even doing this?\n\n  \nWhen I do things I feel tired, so I kind of like to sit, shut down everything and just stay in silence.\n\nEven from a christian perspective - all is vanity\n\nI confess I don't like how things are now, but I don't know how to change... Life is becoming less and less attractive\n\nThis sounds allot like something I have gone through. Many call it the dark night of the soul. Please search for it online. Now that you have these new insights about the ego you no longer have to play that game. Now you can work on your kindness and doing good for the world. This on itself is full filling and from the Buddhist perspective is why we should meditate. To help all beings. Give it a chance. Metta meditation is also helpful.\n\nMan, this was not experience with meditation at all.\n\n&gt;How can I possibly get my motivation back, when meditation showed you that desiring things is pointless?\n\nIs that what it shows you? The goal of meditation is to have clarity as to why you feel the way you do, not to become apathetic.\n\nIt's not true that desiring things is pointless.... it's that desiring \\*pointless\\* things is pointless. A lot of people go through life desiring pointless things -- fancy cars, designer clothes, shallow popularity, etc. Because they lack \\*clarity\\*, they don't realize that these things are pointless. They don't understand why they want them. Meditation helps you develop the clarity to understand WHY you want things, and therefore clarify what's actually important.\n\nIt's not pointless to want love. It's not pointless to want to have fun. It's not pointless to connect with others. It's not pointless to want security, or good health. It's not pointless to enjoy your life. These wants are natural and important parts of being alive, not tricks that your ego is playing.\n\n&gt;I will just spend next 70 years of my life, just sitting around not getting hobbies, or talking to people because meditation shows you don't need anything externally.\n\nWhat meditation are you practicing that tells you you don't need anything externally? have you considered trying Metta? Or maybe taking a break from meditation for now and potentially talking to a counselor? Disassociation and derealization CAN happen with meditation, but it's certainly not the goal and not the truth of life.\n\nLife is a game and we are here to play, so despite spiritually and everything, I am gonna play this game and be the best version of myself. That‚Äôs what I think. \n\nLife is also a journey and you‚Äôre not meant to have a purpose all the time, explore the world, shake things a bit and the purpose will reveal itself to you. Also note that the purpose changes as you change. There is no fixed purpose for everyone throughout life.\n\nTo sum it up, wake up at 3am to meditate for 1-2 hours but now don‚Äôt just sit there all day, getup and be the best version of yourself . No offence but none of the guru, monk, father or any spiritual guru is doing us a service for free. They are also taking donations or money. They are also playing the games. So, just like the quote, when in Rome, behave like Romans. I will say, When on Earth, behave like Humans.\n\nYou need a teacher.\n\nSounds like may be depressed üòî do you not get joy from music or tasty food or any of the simple things? The thing I love about meditation is that it reduces my focus on all the egotistical material nonsense and gives me the headspace to enjoy the simpler things.\n\nFirst of all, I believe you. I believe that through meditation, you have started to become aware of feelings and thoughts you weren‚Äôt previously aware of which now is preventing you from engaging in old patterns. I would suggest that continue to stay aware of your internal thoughts and feelings in moments when you feel a desire to connect to someone, and notice what prevents you from doing so. The process of meditation is simply being aware of your internal state. Therefore, meditation itself did not bring you here, but rather your newfound awareness of your internal working is allowing you to be aware of signals that are telling you not to engage with people!\n\nI also agree with what someone else said about finding a teacher. I‚Äôve had good experiences with zen teachers. They have helped guide me really well.\n\nThis to me seems to be classic before enlightenment chop wood carry water, after enlightenment chop wood carry water\n\nSo... even though you say you are at peace, you are also saying you are not at peace\n\n‚Äúnon resistance does not mean resignation‚Äù\n\nI think it's just a transitionary phase. For the first part of your life you were motivated by ego, and that defined your life. Now your values are changing to more spiritual values, so all of the ego-centric things you were working towards seem pointless. You have to realize that all of those ego-centric things are only a small part of what is possible.¬† We tend to think in terms of those things, making more money, dating attractive people etc. But there are lots of other areas in life to excel that you don't see.¬† Like finding the brightness and sunshine and calmness in day to day activities, and then trying to spread that to as many people as possible. Some of the most important human creations were created by people who were motivated by spiritual values. Think of some of the biggest cultural phenomenons, like lord of the rings, Harry Potter, Coldplay, Oprah, all of these creations by people, yes they probably were ego driven for a certain part of their life, but the reason they were able to create these things that have spread so much sunshine and joy into millions of people is that they were motivated by something deeper inside and much more spiritual. It's difficult to explain because our world is so materialistic, but when you start to view things more spiritually it gradually starts to make more sense and you will find that motivation again.\n\nYes you could think this if you approach life with a Nihilist viewpoint. You could also meditate and have a religious viewpoint and it deepens your faith or you could take on a Absurdist perspective where life is meaningless except for the meaning we make or you could choose Stoicism and use meditation to deepen your ability to have more virtue and self control or‚Ä¶\n\nI could go on and on. The point is you can choose to make meditation whatever you choose.\n\nIf nothing means anything then you are free to do anything you like. You're looking at it like chains, when they are really wings\n\nI think you're barking up the wrong tree if you're blaming meditation. Might want to examine all the other circumstances in your life too, just to be sure. If you still think it's meditation, then stop meditating and feel motivated.\n\nContrary to the comments, I agree and there is a huge problem both in the meditation and mindfulness community. There is a push towards the idea of not being attached to anything and that \"happiness\" can always be internal which  is incorrect because.. life was never about happiness in the first place. It's about well-being and meaning. Well-being can be altered and improved by means that hold true cross-culturally such as exercise, relationships (platonic and romantic), good nutrition. For all these things, money is necessary. You don't have to be rich but it's necessary. And no, \"buddhist monks\" are not a good example to counter what I just said because mentioning extreme cases doesn't disprove the general rule, it confirms it.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with wanting sex, money for good, healthy food and a gym membership. Depriving yourself from these will decrease your well-being. I'll give an example from my own life : My entire body was hurting because I would wear shoes that were not only cheap but also too small for me. Meditation didn't solve the problem. Buying suitable shoes with a wide toe box is what solved by back pain.\n\nWanting a good job, wanting to be valued by your tribe is natural and healthy. Don't let any meditation guru tell you otherwise. Andy Puddicombe for example (buddhist monk and founder of the meditation app Headspace) is a multi-millionaire. So, apparently, the solution to his problems wasn't to meditate about them. Which is fine.\n\nMedidation is a great tool but it's not the end-all-be-all. Human beings are spiritual but not exclusively. We are also social and biological beings. Not to honor those sides is a disservice to ourselves. Your opinion is very vaild.\n\nThen dont do anything? But I bet you cant do that, can you? ;)\n\nYour eyes are now open, my friend. Keep on pushing through. Nothing is absolute. You just started your new journey. Relax and process what's around you. Things will naturally fall into place.\n\nThis might just be my experience, but I hit a point like this, and it came with considerable depression. It did end. I look at that period now as if it were a major shift in my perspective. It takes time to get comfortable in a new space. The best thing I did for myself was to start doing things that I enjoy for the sole purpose of enjoying them.\n\nI went through a similar thing before when I realized the futility of life and how doing anything at all makes no sense when nothing really matters at all. What I‚Äôve personally learned over the years is that nothing matters however you as an individual are able to give a purpose to things. \nFor example, I‚Äôve given my life a purpose by striving for my own personal happiness and by doing what I want to with my time to be truly happy. \nSo I got sober, started exercising regularly, and started working on passion projects that make me happy and feel fulfilled. I can see that none of this matters in my life as I will die someday, but I can still find my happiness in the things that I do because that‚Äôs kinda just what life is all about in my opinionü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è \nHope this helps a bit lol\n\nMeditation is meant to center you with yourself. And work within. Our work is never done (self-improvement, self-love, unconditionally loving self so we can be of service to others since we are all essentially reflections of each other)... if you deny your highest excitement and passion then you are simply getting in your own way and blaming meditation instead of getting in tune with what serves your highest good and healing.\n\nI hear what you are feeling and mean...but it's the ego telling you this sad story because it's jealous you're so focused on meditation instead of listening to your own inner being...give your ego some love as well. It'll help. Bit by bit. It's a balancing act. We all have a part to play...in a playful way.\n\nMeditation or not, you are still obligated to do your very best and live with purpose each and every day. It‚Äôs your duty as a human-being to do so and you are only betraying yourself if you don‚Äôt.\n\nThat‚Äôs why you made this topic in the first place because you know it‚Äôs true. And it‚Äôs not about how much money you have or don‚Äôt have, it‚Äôs what you do in the present moment every day to make things better for yourself and others.\n\nPeople get rich and go broke and then get rich again all the time and it‚Äôs perfectly normal. You should also try to get rich whether you like money or not because if you‚Äôre rich, you actually have the freedom to do what you want ALL the time, like meditating and freeing your mind. \n\nBut to get there, you HAVE to sacrifice and be willing to take the hits. ALL of us do. But trust me, in the end, it‚Äôs worth it. Be good, be bad, nobody cares üòâ\n\nSounds like you are depressed, and the meditation simply uncovered your coping mechanisms. Maybe see a mental health professional.\n\nThink about what makes you happy despite motivation. What you love doing isn't pointless just because you found inner stillness. Exploring life isn't pointless just because you understood that the best path is to meditate at each moment. Rather, rediscovering each moment from the newer perspectives this provides is a good way of putting to use meditation.   \n  \nAlso, exploring whatever is that you feel in this moment even if you aren't perceiving anything in particular with your mood is a way in which you might find out more about yourself and find that even when you are already everything you live right now in a reality where you can experience everything moment by moment.\n\nThings like making a butterfly garden and helping animals in need have been useful to me, I do still crave a gf from time to time, but I'm 5 2 I won't waste my time with all the fake shit just to get there.\n\nDid meditation kill your desire to have experiences on Earth? Is there nothing you want to see, explore, do? Is there nothing else you want to learn about the physical universe? What about devoting your remaining 70 years to the service and glory of Life!\n\nshouldnt you have some desire and motivation to get closer to the source?\n\nWhat kind of meditation did you practice?\n\n&gt; The problem is, I wish I had desire, I wish I had motivation.  But meditation runs so deep, there is literally no reason to be doing anything in life anymore.\n\nWhat sort of \"reason\" do you believe you need to do something? Are you expecting some special invitation, or some sort of universal \"purpose\" to show up out of nowhere?\n\nMeditation lets you step back, and look at things as they really are. If you found you lost desire to do something, then the likely cause is that your previous causes were not particularly fulfilling to you in that moment, because it wasn't really something you truly desired. However, what you're describing is no different than what you were doing before, only you changed the focus of your attention from something one group of people told you was important (dating, money, hobbies), to something a different group of people told you was important (detachment, silence, mental clarity).\n\nThis doesn't mean you need to sit back and just sit around waiting for nothing, that's just a conclusion your mind came up with in some moment, because it seemed like the easiest thing to do. You're still just going with the flow, the only thing that's changed is you walked to a different river.\n\nYou clearly don't find this to be particularly fulfilling either, therefore do the normal thing that meditation offers. Step back, evaluate your life, and figure out what you *actually* want. There's nothing wrong with that thing being materialistic. You live in a material world after all, and having material goals is a fairly natural extension of such an existence. \n\nYou mentioned that you consider everything to be \"pointless,\" so then what sort of \"point\" are you expecting to find? Are you expecting to eventually discover some fundamental purpose to life, where if you do it then the universe will applaud you, pat you on the head, and tell you \"you're doing a good job?\" At this point you should already understand that this is not going to happen. \n\nAll you can really do is set out a goal for yourself, and find purpose in that goal. That goal doesn't need to be to find some sort of greater universal purpose. You already outlined several things that could serve the purpose; start dating, earn money, or find a hobby. The act of picking and sticking to that goal is what makes it worthwhile. The only difference is that before you didn't pick your own goals, but just followed along with what people told you was the \"correct\" thing to do. With meditation you can actually evaluate all your options, and tell yourself \"I want to do this, this, and this, in order to accomplish that, that, and that.\" Once you set these goals out, then there's your ambition. It's won't be a universal, fundamental ambition, but that's shouldn't really be your goal as a human. It will be *your own* ambition, one that you decided in with clear eyes.\n\nWhen you establish these goals for yourself, you will find that meditation is going to be extremely useful in preventing you from getting distracted. It will guide your focus, and ensure that you are constantly taking steps to reach the goals you set out for yourself. That will become *your* purpose. One you chose for yourself, with an understanding of where you want to get to. The \"point\" will be the fact that you chose it for yourself, rather than having someone choose it for you. That's about all anyone can really ask for.\n\nThis is when you switch to purpose driven activities. This is when you discover yourself, your creative interest, etc. And you start aligning with your true self rather than your ego. You discover who you are and then once you do that, you will automatically start to adjust the outside to reflect this.. maybe new job, new creative pursuits, new friends, etc.\n\nYou start living purposefully.\n\nThere is a reason to do things in life. You are confusing desire and clinging/craving. We still need to have desire. The Buddha didn‚Äôt reject desire outright. He taught that cultivating skillful desires such as for love, compassion, wisdom, and enlightenment is essential, while unskillful desires tied to clinging and craving lead to suffering. The desire to reach enlightenment is something the Buddha strived for diligently. We just need not cling to things because the clinging causes suffering. \n\nMeditation is about finding peace, not detaching from life‚Äôs meaningful pursuits. A balanced practice, with mindfulness and metta, can help you reconnect with purpose while maintaining peace. Seek a therapist and teacher if you haven‚Äôt already. May you find peace in your journey!\n\nBrother could you please tell me how you did the practice? It's a little contradictory to me but I want to know your situation before I give you my opinion.\n\ndoesnt seem like meditation killed all your motivation to me. sounds like you have motivation and desire to find new motivation and desire. appears as though the issue is either negative feelings or lack of positive feelings. my know-nothing advice would be to try to address those issues directly\n\nSo you are desiring, desire. As for purpose in life? That begs the question, what is Purposeful to you? You must have some interests, music, sports, hopscotch. Is there a reason to do things you find enjoyable? it seems the question answers itself here, to enjoy them. I think it's possible, when you get deep into meditation, new exstasential thoughts can arise, just as you posted, thoughts about how nothing matters, no reason to do anything, but these are just thoughts that may have some negative feelings associated with them, and attaching to them as if they are true, can cause lack of energy/motivation. Continue on, stay strong, take a stroll out in nature.  ‚úåÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nYes. \n\nOnce you find this state, the only thing left to do is *give*.\n\nWelcome. \n\nIt's time to find your Dharma, son. Your mission, your calling, the reason you came into creation other that ego satisfaction. \n\nI can't tell you how to find it, other than to *listen* carefully.\n\nYou‚Äôre experiencing the shedding of external motivations which is the first step to getting in touch with your internal and more nebulous and lofty motivations. Uncharted mental territory for you and maybe uncomfortable for a while, but not a bad thing. \n\nThe purpose of your life is to live it- so go on and get to it! \n\nSeek to find new experiences and learn from the opportunities they present- you have a lifetime of growth and new perspectives to look forward to.\n\nI think you‚Äôre depressed/going through a depression. \n\nI think blaming meditation is convenient.\n\nYou need to move forward with your life with this new way of looking at things and let it evolve. Actually this kind of realisation makes life lighter; you can shed unnecessary things, be more authentic and not take yourself too seriously. But remember, you are alive, you have a physical body and needs.\n\nLet‚Äôs imagine for example, that you suddenly encounter yourself in a life or death situation; a mad man with a knife is chasing after you. Do you just stand there and say ‚Äòoh well‚Äô and let them kill you? Or do you fight for your life? Or you see a family member about to be hit by a car and you are in the right place to pull them to safety. Do you act?\n\nRemember; life is precious. Your life is precious. Go out there and test the lessons you‚Äôve learned from meditation!\n\nThis is just a phase. It will pass. I didn‚Äôt go through this exactly, but I went through something sorta similar where I felt like I had no personality, no ‚Äúfight‚Äù. \n\nIt goes away. \n\nThat said, maybe change the kind of meditation you do for w while. Maybe try Metta? Metta meditation makes you want to help people and that‚Äôs active. \n\nPlenty of people have gone through stuff like this and it‚Äôs just fine, after a while. \n\nIf I‚Äôm honest though, I think it‚Äôs probably just an ego defense mechanism. As you get closer to actually Awakening, the mind will often play all sorts of tricks to get you to stop doing the thing that it realizes could be the end of it. \n\nAlso, maybe just take a couple weeks off? And/or talk to a good teacher. I don‚Äôt think that it‚Äôs gonna be permanent. \n\nBut, maybe I‚Äôm wrong. It‚Äôs just that the suffering you are describing is not in alignment with the state of actually having seen through your desires and aversions. That is a very peaceful place to be. One wouldn‚Äôt suffer from it.\n\nHow are you at peace with yourself if you wish something about you was different?\n\nYou are in essence right. Nothing matters in this world. Why so many monks go live in caves. They understand all the wasted energy humans spend on non-sense. But for me the way I understand it is because nothing matters what you decide to do with your time matters. How you are playing in the playground that life matters. Understand the fact that nothing matters is meant in the sense to not take anything too seriously. The worse things we see from human happen mostly because we take things too seriously. But this being said doesn‚Äôt take away the richness of the moments we experience and memories we get to create. Those are real to us and the energy created by them is eternal. Something maybe to meditate on ;)\nAlso, meditation will bring you on many phase. When I was doing my meditation teacher training our teacher would always tell us to not get lost in the phenomenon. We should acknowledge how we‚Äôre feeling and what those emotions mean to us but continuing the practice is essential to continue to grow. \nIf you haven‚Äôt tried that yet I would recommend a heart and/or gratitude based meditation. They‚Äôd  be helpful for you and what you‚Äôre going through. Setting intention to reconnect with your appreciation of this world as it is would help you ground slowly back. Just a suggestion.  \nHope this helps\n\nWhen there's no reason to do anything, that's when the real fun begins. Do stuff just cause. Play the RPG.\n\nIf You can't think of anything to live for beyond your own self gratification then meditation is not your problem\n\nSome temporary states I have encountered ‚Äúdestroys‚Äù all desires AND will. On low depth combined with no or little insight that can be very demotivating. Go read about layers and locations online by Jeffery Martin (especially layer 2, not location 2).\n\nI think it‚Äôs important to point out that your insights are incomplete and your conclusions are therefore not aligned with the Truth. In a way your ego has twisted the insights you do have and made a big deal of it - the real message is now corrupt. Do some vipassana instead of concentration based practices and try to make it to stream entry. That would most likely resolve your problem.\n\nDo you feel at peace?\n\nThere is a big possibility that you‚Äôre just noticing more of what you‚Äôre lacking. What kind of meditation practice do you do?\n\nYou‚Äôre halfway there, the tunnel is about to show..\n\nYup. Turns out America‚Äôs capitalistic, individualistic, materialistic hamster wheel is not in tune with eastern philosophy. Once you can see the wheel for what it is, it‚Äôs hard to be on it. I was an extremely ambitious person successful in corporate life‚Ä¶but the bottom fell out the more I meditated and listened to people like Alan Watts/read The Tao, etc. Now I‚Äôm in a bit of a limbo but no regrets.\n\nIf you never had motivation or purpose in life I imagine you could go back to living how you did before meditating; with motivation and purpose\n\nthe purpose of doing any of those things is to FEEL. everything humans desire in life is because they want the feeling they belief they‚Äôll achieve if they get it. ppl want a significant other bc they want to FEEL loved, to FEEL connected. ppl want money bc they want to FEEL secure, to FEEL freedom . so it isn‚Äôt pointless. even rn, you want to have goals again bc you don‚Äôt want to feel like things have no purpose anymore.\n\nMeditation didn't do that. Sitting and meditating made you realize you lack motivation and meaning in your life. That emptiness was always there.\n\nThis kind of introspective breakthrough happens to many who deeply reflect or meditate, often leading to questions about the purpose of life. I believe what you‚Äôre experiencing is a classic existential crisis. Why should I bother working out if I‚Äôm going to die anyway? Why should I invest time and effort into building a career if I don‚Äôt care about money or status? These questions are the classic nihilistic experience, and it's good that you have it.\n\nYou have to realize that you‚Äôre not alone in this. Many people, at some point in their lives, start asking these kinds of questions. I‚Äôd even go so far as to claim that you would have reached these questions eventually, whether through meditation or not. Meditation may have simply brought you to them sooner, as it‚Äôs designed to encourage introspection, leading you to question your emotions, urges, and ambitions. In this sense, you might as well be grateful that meditation has prompted these reflections now, rather than 10 or 20 years from now‚Äîor worse, never. Think about it: the insight you‚Äôve gained, would you truly prefer not having it? Would you rather remain in Plato‚Äôs cave, missing the opportunity to rebuild your identity?\n\nTo rebuild yourself, you first have to shed old burdens. Now, you can begin creating a better, more authentic version of yourself.\n\nYou‚Äôre not the only one grappling with these issues. In fact, besides religion, a large part of philosophy deals with the question of life‚Äôs purpose. You might want to explore existentialist philosophy. As a quick start, skim the [Wikipedia article on existentialism.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existentialism) Do it! I liked Albert Camus‚Äô novels ‚ÄúThe Stranger‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Plague‚Äù. They are fairly easy to read, too. You may also find Nietzsche‚Äôs philosophy compelling. Like you, he questioned the meaning of life and argued that one should redefine themselves through their own virtues, striving to become an √úbermensch. Hope this helps. Good luck!\n\nOne possible result of meditation reducing desires is a clarity and purity of thought, action, and speech.  This allows all actions to be based on pure love, not personal desires. \n\nExamples of people who reached this condition include Jesus, the Buddha, Mother Teresa, or Thich Nhat Hanh.\n\nThis sounds to me like a trick of the ego to keep itself alive.  Meditate more, and let the mind fall stiller, and these types of thoughts to fall away, and see what happens. \n\nGood luck.\n\nThis has less to do with meditation and more to do with understanding the underlying truth of reality. Nothing matters and never will. It's your choice whether you let yourself enjoy things or not. You're truly and entirely in control, you just have to allow yourself to enjoy things. \n\nYou've learned nothing matters, that there is no destiny, no \"God's Plan\", and you've decided this means that you cannot enjoy things because in the grand scheme they don't matter. The problem is that you're still taking everything seriously. When everything is serious and nothing matters, you end up offing yourself. (Technically a valid option but mostly just a big waste) Nothing matters and everything is a joke. That's the only way to stay sane. \n\nFor better or worse this is the reality of reality. Everything just is.\n\nI have experienced this before after meditation, too. But not for long. Motivation isn't something you can rely on fully. For me, personally, I realised that motivation will actually not take you far in life. Sure, it may give you a boost, but motivation will not carry you through life alone.\n\nPerhaps you should look at it another way. Meditation has allowed you to see that maybe you need to find your purpose. Your true purpose. Because when you find your purpose, it will give you the drive to do things. And when you have drive, you can then start applying discipline to things. You need no motivation for discipline.\n\nMotivation is seriously overrated. What's the point in a short burst of motivation, if you don't have drive for a long-term goal? You need to keep the momentum going. Motivation just will not do that for you.\n\nDiscipline can be done without a purpose, but it is less of a chore with a purpose. It's easier said than done, but find your why. Truly think about what your why is. What do you want in life? Where would you like to see yourself in the future? Why do you think you are here on this earth? Every body has a purpose.\n\nI really hope this helps. You may still blame meditation. But I personally wouldn't. From my perspective, it allowed me to see what my true self was. Then I took the necessary steps afterwards. Meditation has changed my life for the better. \n\nCheers.\n\nAs a novice meditator, I often wonder if this is the consequence of dedicated meditation.\n\nIt sounds to me that you glimpsed the backside of Nirvana, and you became overwhelmed. Maybe the step right before it.\n\nWhat you need to do is reconnect to the vibrations within you and around you. It is those vibrations that meaning still has a place and will reconnect you to what you are to become. \n\nNext, you must find purpose for the flesha connection to vibration needs a tuning fork to help it stay connected, and prevent the monkey mind from wanting to just sit among the leaves in the branches of enlightenment. Once you find it, then do it. Shorten your meditation for a little while, but don't stop. You will get back to purpose.\n\nI am not sure whether you will read this or not. I am not even sure whether anyone guided you for meditation or not but here are my few cents \n\nYou unlocked the 1st stage. But the journey is not over.\n\nThe practice of meditation started in ancient Hindu and followed by Buddhist practice. As per the Hindu mythology, Anjuna, the greatest Archer of that time, had the exact saquestions you currently have. Krishna, an incarnation of God, explained to him that \n\nEveryone has a role to play in this world. By being aware you don't get attached to the material things and emotions. Hence the one who is aware of awakened will be impartial and unaffected but he still have the role to play in this world. \n\nMeditation is called Dhyana Yoga. Playing one's role in this world is called Karma Yoga. \n\nYour deeds decide your karma and your karma decides your future in this birth or next. By good karma one gets closer and ultimately becomes part of the source.\n\nI am not sure I explained everything in this short answer but I don't want to write things too lengthy and too complicated\n\nMeditation doesn't do that. You my friend are depressed. You need to go talk to your doctor and maybe a therapist friend.\n\nFrankly, it sounds more like you've got a case of depression than you've managed to find yourself at peace. Peace isn't nothingness. If meditation 'showed' you that there is no point in doing anything, then there's something significantly wrong with how you're doing it.\n\nIf you are genuinely without desire and not depressed, why is the only thing that's important in life what you want? If you've actually got rid of your desires (not something I'd want to get out of this, but each to their own) then start focussing on what other people want and need. Make that your purpose.\n\nI recommend the two books available by Ichiro Kishimi. They provided context to the very similar emotional whiplash that deep meditation gave me.\n\nYou have not ceased to desire and you have not found peace my friend as you are still desiring desire itself. I urge you to think about what made you passionate as a child and find ways to pursue it\n\nMy first thought upon reading the title: Then you aren't doing it right. \n\nAfter reading your post.\n\nYou aren't doing it right and are lying to yourself. What do you mean you have no desire when you describe desiring desire? That you are reaching out for help also shows you have a desire to better yourself. To fix something you perceive as wrong.\n\nWhat you're describing sounds like severe depression, not some product of meditation. Go to a doctor and add gaba, a mulitivitamin, and omega 3 to your daily routine. Recommend googling vitamin deficiences that cause depression and ensuring whatever multi you get has all the vitamins. They often don't have Omega 3. You might need B16 and I only found that in a powerful b formula. Your body is a biological machine. If needs vitamins to not be depressed. Add them to your daily life, but also consult a professional. Also exercise.\n\n(Funny story: I was suffering from depression, both mild last year without knowing it and more severe years ago, before vitamins helped improve it greatly. I was sitting, being depressed, and talking to myself in my head. We can be depressed here, or we can be depressed out there walking and getting micro dopamine hits. I still didn't want to do it, so I said this profound message to myself. \"I'm sorry I gave you the illusion of choice. Get up and get out there!\" FINE!)\n\nIf it is from meditation, you ascribe meaning to the world. It comes from your nature, your interactions with the world around you, preferences, environment, life experience, memories. There is a joke about why someone still lives, they like Pizza and eating pizza as it brings them happiness. Perhaps your friends are just vapid and you need new friends. Perhaps you outgrew your hobbies and need new ones. Perhaps you need purpose to drive you forward.\n\nIn the Book of Thoth, when stricken from the records of life/death, you must state your purpose for existing. Eternity without death, without the refresh, must be deterministically driven. If nothing has meaning, then why not do what makes you happy? If nothing has meaning why not find something to tend to? If nothing has meaning, why not explore? This world does have meaning, to us, individually. Life is a beautiful experience filled with wonderful suffering, misery, and pain, along side celebration, joy, and warmth. \n\nAlso, keep in mind that humanity is currently rat-sinking. Enjoy the abundance before the collapse. You'll quickly find meaning when you have to work hard for food. My sentiment may seem slightly off, but from my perspective, \"You believe suffering will go on forever, but it really is a passing moment.\" This is a lesson my greater/higher self told me. \n\nFor all those saying this is part of transcendence. LMAO, part of you is either already more expensive (higher dimensions) or it isn't. You, this part of you, will be here. There is no ascension to higher reality of peace and happiness. \"There is no higher or lower self. There is only the self, observing the self, from multiple different perspectives.\" A lesson learned when during hypnosis I tried calling that part of me my higher self. Even Buddha realized he had gotten it wrong before he died. Sad only a small percentage of his students believed him.\n\nIf you are curious, what you are trying to fix isn't the sense of self, aka ego. It is the separation of the conscious mind from the sub conscious and greater consciousness beyond. Hold a finger up. Now try moving it without command. Notice you cannot, but the moment you issue a command thought it moves. Your sub conscious is coordinating the movement the conscious mind is commanding. Now apply that to spiritual matters and you'll grasp what you need to do.\n\nThe divide between the conscious and sub conscious mind is called the critical mind. Don't read to much into the name, it isn't critical, but it functions as a barrier. Thousands of years ago, humanity did not have this barrier, so in many including myself's opinion it was added. Before, there was no separation of these two. The Critical Mind starts forming around the age of 10. Guess what age children who see spirits stop seeing spirits at? Be it occult or enlightenment, your goal is not the destruction of yourself. Only a malevelant entity will tell you to do that. Your goal is to breach the divide in yourself and this will lead you to being whole or enlightened.\n\nWhen I first heard about those who just meditated for 12h a day, I couldn't understand it. Once you dive deep into meditation, you can see that it can become it's own purpose and meaning and everything.\n\nThis is happening to me too.\n\nMeditation is a tool that allows you to be present and respond rather than react. Longer, deeper breaths will help bring calm and slow your energy, but you can also choose to breathe faster and build energy, this can help with motivation.\n\nOnce you don‚Äôt feel you NEED to do anything, you can do what you WANT.\n\nCongratulations, that‚Äôs the first step to achieving real success. Now that you know you have everything you need to be content you can start taking risks and experimenting. Make risky investments, start a business, ask out random people. Now you can treat life like a game without the fear of failure, it doesn‚Äôt have to be motivation just curiosity about life and how far you can go.\n\nGo travel to some cheaper countries, get some culture shock!\n\nYou don‚Äôt have to nullify yourself just go with moderation God help you and God bless all.\n\nModeration is key ime. Meditating for an hour a day sort of just makes me feel a bit disconnected\n\nYou‚Äôre doing it wrong\n\nDamn man what meditations did you listen to! This sounds kinda awesome\n\nYoull get over this phase eventually. I did. It lasted for a couple years\n\nAh, you're entering a phase of awakening. Quite normal. LEAN INTO IT and you will come out the other side a new person.\n\nOur society put way too much value into motivation when real value lies in discipline.\n\nI find many things fulfilling and purposeful, even if they are not driven by attachment or aversion. For example, one doing charity work out of a sense of love within. It does not come from a ‚Äòneed‚Äô to do anything, or out of fear of some consequence, but simply arises by going within and experiencing what life truly is. \n\nFor a long time I had many worldly ambitions. There are still things that need to be done in the world obviously. Now though I have much more spiritual ambition, and I enjoy it far far more. \n\nIt‚Äôs interesting that society has set certain standards that if you aren‚Äôt going out and partying and ruining your health, that‚Äôs not ‚Äúliving life.‚Äù\n\nIt‚Äôs amusing, because I enjoy staying home, reading philosophers and spiritual texts, contemplating the universe, meditation. From these practices done correctly, I feel I truly come alive, as if I was sleeping before. And I‚Äôm making YouTube videos on these topics too.\n\nI find all this more fulfilling and ‚Äòpurposeful‚Äô even though I am not driven by attachment or aversion.\n\nI went full circle on this... and what happened for me is a detached way to live in the material world. However, now I don't have this incessant need to get the best car and the biggest house. The thing is, I'm a living human and naturally, I don't want to starve to death on the street, so I need to do something to make a comfortable living. There's biological motivation for survival. \n\n  \nWe are innately human in this experience, so our purpose is to have a human experience. That's why you should get hobbies etc, because you're capable of feeling, you're capable of having passion, so find your passion because there is nothing more beautiful.\n\nYou meditated incorrectly. You probably suppressed your thoughts and emotions. And didn‚Äôt accept it. That‚Äôs my best guess.\n\nThere‚Äôs only so much you can think to yourself / meditate alone. You are meant to experience other people and experience the universe. Life isnt what you think about being. Your meditation should impact how interact with others and you show up in the world.\n\nMeditation is one thing. But meditation does not bring balance to your life. Meditation is but one aspect, contraire to what many people think when they said meditation brings balance. It is but one aspect of our lives that we too must balance in the grand scheme of things. You've found an amazing tool to help with inner peace or sense of self but that must also be balanced with the wonderful things on the outside world too. Keep that in mind. Your journey goes on, my friend :) I have learned this through my last 22 years of meditating\n\nThe fact that you are ‚Äúwanting‚Äù desire in itself is a desire. Your desire never really dies. Trust me you‚Äôre fine. And its not a bad thing that desire stays, its good that it does. Its just that rn you are seeing that materialistic things are not the true essence of life, which you were made to believe all your life. Now you‚Äôre seeing everything from a different perspective, and all those lies have fallen apart. But also realise your freedom to choose what you enjoy doing. Realise that you can do something for the heck of it and not to just gain the egoistic status. Realise how now that you‚Äôre here, you get to live here fully and totally. You exist right here right now. See it, don‚Äôt think it.\n\n‚ÄúI wish I had desire.‚Äù\n\nIs wishing not desire?\n\nLife, is a state of mind. You can talk yourself in, or out of anything. Control your mind, emotions and thoughts. Plus, you‚Äôre misunderstanding meditation. I don‚Äôt know what meditation you‚Äôve been studying, but it‚Äôs not a productive endeavor!. If everyone quit life because of meditation , nobody would be doing anything but meditating. Move to a monastery. At least they‚Äôd feed you. Because if you stop living life, you‚Äôll starve!. Wake up, and smell the coffee.\n\nHave compassion for yourself.\n\nYou should study the teachings of the Buddha\n\nYou can read The Book by Alan Watts &amp; To Know Your Self by Swami Satchidananda \n\nAlso books by Dean Sluyter, starting with Why Did the Chicken Cross the Road\n\nYou can also try going deeper in meditation‚Äî &amp; read The Dark Night of the Soul\n\nAre you sure you're not spiritual bypassing? Using meditation like an opiate and neglecting the self? The self might not be the real, ultimate \"you\", but it still has needs. Be kind to it.\n\nIt just means your true purpose is much higher than what you have been doing, but you have diminished your egos control over your mind that now those trivial things were just distraction to what you are really meant to do and be.\n\nGet in touch with your deeper passions. Since you want to want, you clearly care about something. What is that? Accept that you care, accept that you only care because you are delusional. I personally don‚Äôt even think it is delusional or dissociative to choose to engage in the world anyways. Life is illusion. Dissolving into nothingness through meditation is itself completely meaningless through this lens and therefore it shouldn‚Äôt be put on a pedestal above: having a job, seeking power, seeking pleasure, starting a family, living with integrity, etc. The Buddhist narrative of liberation through experiential recognition of anatman, anicca, dukkha is just another narrative. Don‚Äôt let it be the only one.\n\nI went thru this phase too, but now I'm on a limitless modes. Sinse I know I can be do or have anything I have tried many different things and by trying determined what's for me. Now I'm a Reiki master healer, a singer, song writer and producer, a tattoo artist and I'm here to promote my book and my music which are both spiritual and inspirational. I realized that life is eternal and foe fun and that we project it with our perceptions. We essence of life our steering our own illusion with the thoughts that we give our focus to. By practicing to percieve I have been able to let go of inhibitions and open up to sharing my unique experiences with my book and my music and art. Imagination is God so I am being God by using my imagination and it feels good to inspire others. I wrote the book Beings of love light awaken by Ana Guerrero and I have 10 songs now world wide. One of the is called A dream within a dream ‚ú®Ô∏è which was inspired by my spiritual awakening. Another is called all I see is angels which was inspired by practice to percieve. In a world where thoughts create what shall we think. See the good in everything because it's you beautiful unique being shining thru.\n\nI've been meditating for two months now. Before, I was always caught up in my thoughts and expectations, never truly enjoying the beauty of life. But now, it‚Äôs a complete 180. I'm starting to enjoy each moment and I've realized I no longer care about my expectations. While I do spend less time with friends, it's because I‚Äôve begun valuing my time and attention more. Lately, I‚Äôve been doing a lot, but I‚Äôm not concerned about the outcomes anymore; I'm beginning to enjoy the continuous flow of life. I think you're meditating the wrong way. Just try mindfulness meditation. That should be enough.\n\nIf you were a fully conscious soul, living on earth solely to learn and grow through experience. With every lesson brining you closer to enlightenment‚Ä¶ what would you choose to do with your time?\n\nSome of the most motivated people on earth are deeply spiritual at the same time. Maybe there‚Äôs more reason to join the dance than you realise.\n\nListen to some Ram Dass, he has a beautifully eloquent way of describing the divine purpose to life.\n\nHas changed my life completely.\n\nGood luck to you friend\n\nReal problem I see here is not having a proper guide. Unless you have someone who can infuse you with bliss and divine love which further motivates to practice and serve the purpose of creation (creation wants everyone to be happy), negative feelings can develop. I suggest seeking a selfless, capable spiritual guide if you are helpless  I suggest reading \"Reality at Dawn\" by Revered Babuji in which there are guidelines on choosing a proper guru or guide.\n\nThere‚Äôs infinite layers to even this and you can be ambitious in exploring this. There are keys and locks, forever upwards, for the next 70 years. You have touched the tip of the iceberg. Explore. And consider joining a monastery.\n\nThis is why I personally do a lot of visualization meditation. Completely clearing out the brain can be good, and meditation definitely can be a tool for overcoming insecurities and such. But I personally don't want to be \"empty\" or \"egoless.\" I want to feel joy even though it also means feeling pain. I don't want to melt into nothingness, I want to get lost in Love. I use meditation as a gratitude practice and a place to *feel*. I hope you find your way back to experiencing all life has to offer us. Beauty...witnessing it, creating it, fostering it..is a worthy purpose.\n\nHello OP.\n\nI have been reading through your comments and you remind me of that guy from matrix who wanted to go back into the matrix with no memory of having woken up to the actual reality.\n\nWe primarily live in a capitalist world that champions 'I' and demonises 'We' as the poster child of communism. This I has no end to its desires. I see you crib and complain about the lack of motivation in your life. You talk about dates, owning things, money, power etc. Here's the thing, your motivation so far has been selfish. You want these things to make yourself better off even if it makes someone worse off in the process.\n\nThe funny thing is this motivation always pushes and propells you. It doesn't know satiation. Once you have a date, you want someone hotter. Once you get that limited edition baseball card, you crave for another and once you have money, you always always want more of it. This is neither motivation nor ambition. This is greed masquerading as those two. I hope you realise this.\n\nMeditation does not kill motivation. It kills the ego in you. That's why you will find monks working for the benefit of the lowest rung of the society. Meditation makes you realise that you are inevitably better off when everybody is happy and in a good place.\n\nIt is fine to not want what meditation has to offer. Perhaps you really want to bed as many as you can, own more stuff than you need and have more money than you know what to do with. No judgement here. All you need to do is stop meditating. The gains you have made will fade away and in time, you will revert to your old 'motivated' self.\n\nThat you are here discussing this topic in this tone, means you are unfulfilled. Your meditation does not feel successful from where I stand. There's more to this and to your purpose.\n\nI spoke to a Buddhist monk earlier this year. He was a man of less words and one of the wisest things he said to me was ‚Äúit is all about balance‚Äù \n\nSo simple but that is what it is all about.\n\nTime to give your own life purpose the way you want based on your values instead of other people‚Äôs values. You can do it champ üí™üèª\n\nSo there is a lack of compassion, joy, simple pleasures like walking in Peace, expressing happiness to strangers you walk pass?  Joy and peace a sense of wonder looking at flowers trees.. animals etc? \n\nMaybe something deeper is happening? \n\nAwakening and walking meditations have allowed me to appreciate and practise/experience the things I mentioned and more- way more. \n\nThe analytic mind, processing and ID‚Äôing problems has diminished immensely for me. \n\nAs for motivation, I find my motivation is huge and directed to cleaning up my act in general from decades of negligence.  My health, hygiene, household is all clean. So clean- diet, habits almost everything. \n\nI play with my dog more- get so much joy entertaining him, I walk him more- happier with neighbours, more sociable, more friendly and more helpful. \n\nI‚Äôve buried the hatchet with family issues, to the point they get jealous of my peace and lack of triggers, stillness and improvements in my physical appearance. \n\nHealthier body and skin- etc. \n\nThey even gang up a bit, just to pry into me and find out what I did. How I did it- what I ‚ÄúKnow‚Äù now.  lol \n\nStrange as it seems, I unlearned stuff after awakening- ditched old habits identities and attachments beliefs etc etc.  \n\nI see the human ego ramping up in them all the time- \n\nI try to keep my answers simple and don‚Äôt get triggered at all- I like to observe the dynamics  at play and realise ‚ÄúI was like that too-‚Äúmirroring the same behaviour‚Äù just in a different direction or point of view.  \n\nI guess the only ego trap that still is there a little is the pleasure I get from thinking I‚Äôm so glad I went through the Dark night of the soul depression and period of lostness- because this new version of self is in complete contrast to the old paradigm.  \n\nthis is the effect of the awakening process and meditation has had.\n\nI can‚Äôt possibly guess if you should meditate more or less or quit or pause it for a while- \n\nDoes anything I have written resonate with you?\n\nAfter awakening the only your dream is to awaken everyone in the World.\n\nFreedom to work on fulfilling desires - Christianity offers a system and meaning by which to operate in the world when past the renunciation of ego stage.\n\nA devout Buddhist would meditate to nirvana, while a devout Christian would build a family and kingdom.\n\nNow, meditate to observe this particular emotion, thought and behavior of \"having motivation and purpose killed\". If you were really in peace, you would not take action to create a post here.\n\nThis is the magic of meditation for me, being able to observe **every little** cognitive event (search CBT Triangle) of yourself as a human being. You can take advantage of it to become more productive, active and powerful overall.\n\nBut remember, we all need inspiration to spin our brains with fresh air. This is where we get new ideas and motivation from.\nPersonally, I speak with people online to get inspired and keep my motivation flowing. You can search a public \"English server\" on Discord for this\n\nIt doesn‚Äôt sound like you are really at peace with yourself‚Ä¶ what you‚Äôre describing sounds like depression rather than enlightenment. Buddha spoke about the middle way. You‚Äôre alive, you‚Äôre a sentient being, you‚Äôre not dead yet. Meditation should prepare you for your death, but not kill you. The point of not desiring is that you avoid suffering if things don‚Äôt work out. It means having no expectation, no attachment, no ego. But it doesn‚Äôt mean that you don‚Äôt enjoy what comes your way. It doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt achieve anything‚Ä¶\n\nYou're supposed to make it all up as you go along\n\nDevelop an understanding karmayog, working and living because you are born as a human with certain duties. A good commentry on Bhagavad Gita would be very helpful.\n\nIf you have 70 years to go you're in the infancy of a meditation practice and life in general.  Sounds like growing pains, part of the process.\n\nI have had this same experience. About half way through my journey of correcting.¬†\n\n\nIMO the effects of meditation has a lot to do with the environment you are in.¬† As do most things.\n\n\nI also believe that people who were disassociative (as their chosen coping mechanism to chronic low grade trauma) prior to learning meditation - probably would not benefit from meditation.¬†\n\n\nIt also makes sense that people who are currently incapable of loving themselves, would also not benefit. Meditation has a way of bringing 'excitation' down, but doesn't bring inhibitions up. Self acceptance should be learned to bring that up to neutral, then meditation to bring disinhibitions down.¬†\n\n\nCertain mental illnesses probably have different effects from meditation as well.¬†\n\nI get the exact opposite effect. Meditation reminds me of my motivation for all of these things. If I skip it too often, I get unmotivated and depressed. Sound like you're smoking weed not meditating üòâ\n\nWhile meditation does teach you not to desire, it more importantly teaches you to enjoy the present moment. So find simple things you enjoy, try to see all of the beauty in this world, live your life!! You‚Äôre here for a reason, your soul chose this life for you to learn and grow from it, and unless you are Buddha there are still things that you need experience to do that, so get out there and keep living while integrating what you learn from meditation. I think you might be taking this valuable lesson of learning not to desire things the wrong way.\n\nIf meditation isn't working for you then try consciously rewiring your brain during the day. This video explains how: [https://youtu.be/WH1b7Cg-Aw0](https://youtu.be/WH1b7Cg-Aw0)   I see more results this method.\n\nhi, not sure if your meditation is inspired by buddhism, but, if it is, it seems like you‚Äôre near mastering detachment. i would argue that you could be depressed by the realization of how all of the goals you used to chase are just an illusion. which, to be fair, is a really difficult concept to come to terms with when we‚Äôve been conditioned to see the world through one perspective. i have always said that life is meaningless, thus you can make whatever meaning you want out of it. no living being owes anyone else their life or their energy. if you don‚Äôt benefit from the world you‚Äôve found yourself in, maybe it‚Äôs time to find a society that aligns itself more with your philosophy where a 9-5 career isn‚Äôt the only path. i hope you can see this lack of motivation as space to explore what actions would make your life seem worth it, even if it‚Äôs untraditional. finding your joy outside of societally set milestones seems like it could greatly improve your life.\n\nThis is exactly my case. When I bought my apartment when I was 30 years old, I felt that I had no more goals. And I've seen back that nothing I pursued really gave me lasting happiness or at least peace. So I said, why could these new goals that appear like a second home or a new girlfriend really give me happiness? I have no reason to have any guarantee of that. So I've entered a horrible state of sensations that nothing has a purpose. Even if I can create a purpose, the mere fact that we are purposes creators within a fish bottle called universe without any kind of purpose by itself it's heart breaking for me.\n\nPractice metta (loving kindness / compassion meditation) and a very worthwhile drive to work for the benefit of other beings will develop.\n\nI think you may have seasonal affective disorder -- it is autumn, and people often feel hopeless and depressed.  I would recommend that you research vitamin d3.  I take it, and I feel better.  I have to say:  go slowly with it -- know that you are taking it at your own risk -- and do NOT take it every day.  I know the manufacturer's directions on the bottle are wrong.  I know -- from my own research on the internet -- it has a half-life of 14 days -- which means it stays in the body for 14 days, and if you take it every day, overdose side effects are possible.  I am 5'2 inches tall, and I weigh 115 pounds.  I take 7000 iu vitamin d3 every 8 days with a booster of 2000 iu every 4 days, and this definitely helps me.  I get headaches if I go over 7000 iu.  I also recommend exercise, which will boost your mood with endorphins, and actually give you goals.  I think sitting and meditating may be boring.  I think walking is best, as it is very good for your heart.\n\nA shift in motivation and purpose after deep meditation is not uncommon. What often happens is that the old, ego-driven motivations‚Äîseeking success, validation, or external achievements‚Äîfade away, making it seem like there‚Äôs ‚Äúno purpose‚Äù left. But this is actually an opening, not a loss.\n\nMeditation dissolves the restless, conditioned mind, revealing a deeper intelligence beyond ambition or external goals. Instead of being driven by external pressures, you begin to act from an inner stillness, a place of spontaneous right action. \n\nThis can feel disorienting at first because the usual push-and-pull of desires weakens, but in time, a new kind of purpose emerges‚Äîone rooted in presence, clarity, and a deep sense of connection with life itself.\n\nRather than trying to rekindle old motivations, allow yourself to rest in this space of not-knowing. From that stillness, a more authentic and effortless sense of purpose will arise‚Äînot one imposed by the mind, but one that flows naturally from your being.\n\nI don't see the problem\n\nTry manifestion meditation"

    "body": "I'm almost 30 now. I discovered meditation 15 years ago by accident. It's been an on-off relationship since then.\n\n7 years ago I began listening to J. krishnamurti's talks who had a tremendous impact on my view of spirituality and enlightenment seeking.\n\nI have tried so many things, countless techniques, different schools of meditation and esoterism, different magic systems of initiation, different religious traditions... Only to circle back to the starting point which is \"I do not know\".\n\nSo I ditched it all and remained with myself.\n\n3 years ago I started the most basic and simple meditation technique there is: Stillness.\n\nAnd I realized that this was what I was searching for the past decade of my life. By just sitting still... It has always been there with me.\n\nBy just keeping the muscles of the body dead still, including the eyes and the tongue, something happens...\n\nI am still exploring the experiences as it is new each time, but I think it could help somebody else searching for understanding.\n\nIt is simple, as follows:\n\nSit in a comfortable position. Clasp your hands and keep them in between your thighs.\n\nKeep your back straight and steady and hold your head in a natural position.\n\nKeep your tongue to the roof of your mouth and don't let it move.\n\nNow, your eyes should be closed and kept still facing toward the \"third eye\". ( When I started this, my closed eyes were just immobile facing in front of me. But they naturally shifted upward after sometimes, so I found this position to be natural and comfortable)\n\nNow, stay still like that for a while. Do not move a muscle (except for the breath)\n\nYour body will start \"vibrating\", you will \"hear some in-ear sounds\" and you may \"see some colors\" as your energies are naturally doing their thing. Just ignore them and let it happen.\n\nAs you practice and practice and practice, your restless mind will follow the stillness of the body and it will become uninterested in the thinking process... \n\nAnd that's where it will happen...",

    "all_comment_text": "I think of it like my brain is a bucket of water. When I‚Äôm not thinking, that water goes dead calm.\n\nTo add to the analogy I recently heard Michael Singer on his podcast say something along the lines that whenever there's ripples (a disturbance) we try to flatten it by thinking about it more but we only create more ripples, so he suggests to just leave it alone\n\nI like to imagine me like this too... If I think too much it gets muddy\n\nthis is Gautama Buddha's analogy. One of the best analogies I ever came across on meditation.\n\nThis is a helpful way of visualizing it. Thanks\n\nGreat hack\n\nYou just described my own meditation techniques to a T. The process of checking in on areas of tension leads to figuring out why I am holding tension there in the first place and I am able to settle into complete mind and body relaxation.\n\nSame. But after 30 minutes i tend to hyper focus on my tension which is usually in my lower back and legs from sitting in a crossed position for too long. Any advice on how to let go of that tension?\n\nStart a yoga practice. The purpose of physical yoga is to get your body in shape to sit in meditation.\n\nNever heard of that being a thing. That‚Äôs genius\n\nAbsolutely, thank you\n\nAll of this sounds amazing with the benefits and I'm wanting to find how it effects me in the end. Can I dm to learn about it more? It seems impossible to hold a quite mind for 5 minutes let alone 30 seconds.\n\nHave you tried meditation chairs? It helps me quite a lot with back pain\n\nI‚Äôve never even heard of these, let me get to it! Bless you!\n\nI use couches and kitchen chairs with a pillow for my lower back. Feet flat on the floor. It works fine and eliminates that low back pain from sitting on a floor.\n\nIve tried that, but i always thought that my posture wasnt straight enough when on a cushion-y couch if that makes sense. But i just ordered a meditation chair so definitely excited for that\n\nThere is an effect from having the spine straight. It has to do with the alignment of the chakras. But you can still alter your state of mind without having a perfect body. There are ways to increase the communication between chakras that don't require a perfect spinal position.\n\nEnjoy the chair! Your back will thank you!\n\nYou can also try a meditation bench :)\n\nYou can try yoga nidra, which is essentially stillness, lying down. Since it is typically guided you have something to focus on, rather than letting the mind wander.\n\nWhile it's not exactly what OP described, using this meditation technique, I have learned stillness. As a result once in a while, I will sit, stand or lie completely still. It's like hitting pause on life for a few moments.\n\nI am doing the same but after some point, I feel there is intense magnetic pull /pressure around the center of my inside mouth, it is radiating on center of inside head (between the third eye and the top of head)\n\nHas anyone felt the same? Any inputs on this?\n\nBody scan is associated with Vipassana I think??? I forgot.\n\nYeah that stillness really is something else! :)\n\nForrest Knutson talks about sitting very still (SVS) during Kriya yoga meditation. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/6NpH44c34do?si=Z9a2YMy9QtBYw7J_\n\nThis is an awesome report, and I also love Krishnamurti he's absolutely brilliant.  I have a word of caution though around this part:\n\n&gt;Your body will start \"vibrating\", you will \"hear some in-ear sounds\" and you may \"see some colors\" as your energies are naturally doing their thing. Just ignore them and let it happen.\n\n&gt;As you practice and practice and practice, your restless mind will follow the stillness of the body and it will become uninterested in the thinking process...\n\n&gt;And that's where it will happen...\n\nThis is what happened for you, and I'm sure it happens for a lot of people, but be careful to set up expectations for others.  The reality is that everyone has their own experience, and while specific techniques like this can often be followed for similar experiences, people are so unique and will have unique experiences along with unique challenges along the way.\n\nOverall though I think this is great advice and technique guidelines.  Thank you for sharing :)\n\nMy meditation teacher emphasized the importance of stillness, I am bad at it.. this has given me new motivation, thanks for sharing!\n\nEyes rolling back hard during meditation \n\nI left meditation 2 years ago because I got scared. So what happened was i started doing meditation 2 years ago I was 16 at that time I did mediation for half an hour for a week and suddenly after that one day my eyes  started rolling back hard and my eyes started blinking rapidly and my head started to fall back slowly but I was still balanced. it happened for two days I got scared and left mediation from then  but now I want to start meditation again is it safe? Is this a health Hazzard. What was happening back then can someone explain??\nSorry for bad English it's not my first language.\n\nThis is normal if you‚Äôre focusing on your third eye while your eyes are closed. If u persist focusing on that point through the fluttering for as long as u can , your brain releases a bunch of good stuff and you get a natural ‚Äúhigh‚Äù just feel really good a bunch of serotonin being released. Will also feel different depending on whether there is light hitting your closed eyes or if you‚Äôre in the dark. Try it again man don‚Äôt listen to the dude saying you need to get looked at by a doctor lmao.\n\nA guy down below posted a link depicting the eyes rolling back while meditating  go check it out !\n\nOkk\n\nI‚Äôll have what he‚Äôs having¬†\n\nBtw I was not focusing on the third I was focusing on my breath my eyes automatically started rolling up unconsciously that scared me\n\nYeah I sure will\n\nThe heck!?\n\nI'm new to meditation can I dm? Wanting to find out what the benefits are and how it would effect me. 5 minutes seems impossible let alone 30 seconds.\n\nYeah man shoot me a dm ! Happy to tell you my experience\n\nI beleive you were moving into a different state of mind. Its normal to feel that way,so always have in mind that the body is a vast temple that holds alot of secrets ,so embrace every feeling ,the body got scared because it has never experienced such(fear mechanism is designed to keep us from things we've never done before. But when you go beyond you might even discover something that you will share with the world,and you'll be forever remembered for such knowledge.  üòá\n\nThanks for the reply\n\nW o a h. This sounds cool, can I dm to explore what that is? I've never really committed to meditation quite yet, and I'm wanting to see it for my self of what it can do.\n\nyour body is reacting in a weird way, but you should keep trying different ways to meditate. try searching on YouTube different kinds of guided meditations.\n\nYeah\n\nThis is normal and a sign you were going into a higher state of consciousness.  \n\nYogis say to meditate with eyes slightly uplifted to keep the mind more elevated and go inter higher states more easily.\n\nI knew a girl once who did exactly this. It would happen while she was daydreaming.\n\nThat sounds creepy\n\nYou should make a new thread about what you did, and how you feel. There are many experienced meditators who might help. That said, you can experience physical things for sure... perhaps you were actually tensing up. One of the key things the Buddha said was to relax ‚ÄòI shall breathe in tranquillising the bodily formation‚Äô. If you've tensed up so much you flip out, that's bad. \n\nPractice doing a body scan and relaxing muscles as you go along, from bottom to top (or top to bottom). As you loop around, notice the tensing of muscles that comes with thought. Ease the tension, over and over again. You'll go deeper a little more each time.\n\nSaw a video where to stop all thought a guy just rolled his eyes right back\n\nyou should go see a doctor‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs not normal‚Ä¶\n\nIt's completely normal when accessing different meditative states. You should experiment yourself. It can be life changing in such positive ways.\n\nThat sounds incredible! I‚Äôd love to dive deeper into this and really experience the benefits you‚Äôre talking about. \n\nWould you be open to teaching me how to access those meditative states? It seems like it‚Äôs made such a positive difference for you, and I‚Äôm really eager to learn the techniques that could be life-changing for me too.\n\nSKY Breath work is an online program I paid for that really helped me initially and yes, it did help me achieve altered states of mind and put me in blissful states of mind and helped alleviate stress, helped with decision making, ceasing worry and fear, etc. I've since experimented with various other meditative practices, but for a beginner I'd say SKY is a good start as they have very supportive instructors and you are placed in a group (via Zoom) so you actually have your own little \"tribe\" of support and connection and it really helps , especially when you are first starting on the meditation journey to have that connection to other people and support systems. You can just look up \"SKY Breath work\" online classes on google. I also do mantra chanting to reach altered states and like I said earlier, other meditative practices. It just depends on what I feel would best benefit me in that moment. I honestly think meditation is essential for us being our best self. Especially with the way the world is today and all of the external bombardment of stimulation we get daily all day long. Meditation can help you reach a calm, safe, beautiful place within yourself to give you a much needed reprieve from all of that negative stimulation and tremendously help in keeping you balanced. Best of luck and much love to you.\n\nYeah I will try it again\n\nüíÄüíÄ\n\nYou‚Äôre going into trance.  How long do you typically meditate for?\n\nIt depends, most of the time it is between 30mn to 1 hour. I have to set an alarm because time passes differently when you're \"there\". It's like watching a good movie or spending time with your lover. You're having a good time, time flies.\n\nI have similar experiences.  Have you left your body, had OBE‚Äôs or had astral projections?\n\nI used to explore these in my early twenties but I realized those are distractions, of no real spiritual significance (they are occult tools, but don't really play a role in spiritual seeking). \nI feel (this is just my guess) you must leave these things behind, not just the astral realm but the mental body also to tap into a different  kind of experience.\n\nThere is much to be learned in the astral about life in the physical.  The avatars we meet are our teachers.  This state of mind can produce profound moments of clarity into one self.  \n\nIn my opinion the lights, visions leading to projection are distractions.  The emotional states are good goals to achieve too.  \n\nTo each their own.  Thank you for sharing.\n\nWhat, I've sort of experienced similar thing before but then stopped and now been more then interested to find out. Can I dm to get help?\n\nSure\n\nRighto! The fancy stuff is just a distraction.\n\nReal\n\ni suggest you read william buhlman books on astral projection if you think it doesn't serve for spiritual enlightment You're missing out on a treasure of an experience.\n\nDharana Darshan is book you might want to check out. It describes this technique of sitting on floor not moving a muscle for 30 minutes. It calls this just technique for developing concentration skills. If you can do that it's a gateway to meditation techniques described in the same book.\n\nYEP. This is what I do. Stay PERFECTLY still.  Which is harder than one would think because that‚Äôs when the tip of your nose or the edge of your elbow or the top of your toe (or some other part) will start to itch‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs your body trying to get you to move because it‚Äôs used to being the center of attention, but then, if you ignore that‚Ä¶ it eventually goes away and you are in your zone.\n\nSo do you have to start over if you fuck it up?\n\nLol. I assume you‚Äôre being quite contrary right now but‚Ä¶ If you‚Äôre doing the yoga one leg mountain pose or the tree pose (one leg up) for 60 seconds and you lose balance and drop your leg after 58 seconds, then I call that a win, but if you drop your leg after 5 seconds‚Ä¶ wouldn‚Äôt you WANT to start over? I mean‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs all relative. It‚Äôs really up to you and what you‚Äôre trying to accomplish here.\n\nI was meditating earlier and felt compelled to add to this comment. Just take 10 minutes out your day. Maybe as you are sitting on your bed starting or ending your day or something like that, just set the timer on your phone (or a manual timer) for 10 minutes. Just sit still there during that time and just be for ten minutes. Can you give yourself 10 minutes a day until you‚Äôre comfortable with more? If 10 minutes is too long then set the timer for five minutes. Give yourself five moments of stillness.\n\nThanks for the post. I do something similar while meditating except I‚Äôve found when breathing, when I don‚Äôt inhale for an extended time (not uncomfortably) I really hit the zen sweet spot. \n\nThat‚Äôs when I‚Äôm truly still. Though I‚Äôm still noobish this has had a noticeable effect on the experience.\n\nThank you for the good instructions, I find myself doing parts of this. Can you tell me what you do (or don't do) with your attention? Is it like no manipulation or 'dropping the ball'?\n\nI have found there is a difference between focus and attention. Focus is unconscious and attention is conscious focus. By focus I mean where the \"mental eyes\" go. Anything can draw the focus, the sound of a car passing by, the temperature of the room, physical discomfort, memories, imagination, ect... Anything and you don't decide where the focus goes. But attention is when you take focus to the next level, like zooming into the object of focus.\nYou will see that focus is closely related to the physical eyes. When you don't move your physical eyes, the mental eyes also begin to settle down. So do thoughts, so does the self. Then only \"it/you/that/nothing\" remains.\n\nAlright thanks! I think I see attention as a property of conscious awareness, which I measure in focus (broad, pointed, soft, intense...) I tried it a little and I think I understand. The truth seems more experiential than words can describe lol.\n\nWe might have been doing the same!\n\nDo you ever experience an intense sensation of pressure in the third eye area? I get that a lot.\n\nI have a problem, even if I sit straight my neck and head bend down after a while even without my knowledge so when I come out of medication i find my neck bent down or face/head protruding too much outside. How do i keep it straight?\n\nDoes anyone else struggle with needing to swallow excessively in meditation? It‚Äôs become so distracting to me, that I stress about it before even sitting some to meditate. Now I start salivating and needing to swallow before I can even relax, it‚Äôs totally taking over my thoughts and ruining my meditation experience!\n\nHad the same issue for the longest time while I tried to astral project laying down.  Try to put a little sea salt on your tongue prior to your meditation.  It will dry your mouth out a bit and salivating wont be as big of an issue.\n\nI‚Äôll try this! Thank you!\n\nAnd if you at that relaxed state shift your focus to somewhere else and imagine that you're seeing from that point of view, your sense of self will start shifting and go back and firth until you're now more in that other non-physical place.\n\nKeep at it and you'll start to experience space around you in that place until your consciousness fully shifts there and just like how your imagination is the background when you're awake now your physical reality is the background.\n\nYou're now able to walk/fly around there as well touch, feel, taste, smell things as if they weren't physical. \n\nIt has many names, Lucid dreaming, astral projection, the phase, spirit/dream walking but it's all different ways(like bus, car, boat, plane) to get to a different non-physical place(country).\n\nI know what you are talking about. But that's not it.\n\nWhat you describe is astro-mental wandering and this is still in the physical realm by nature. It can be helpful if you want to interact with other beings like elementals and higher forms of life or if you are occult oriented. With that \"you\" are still present and acting.\n\nI am talking about something far deeper than that...\n\nOBE‚Äôs are a great tool for deeper spiritual practice. It‚Äôs not a vacation, many use it to learn about themselves. I‚Äôm not sure you‚Äôve actually had these experiences or at least not enough to understand.\n\nI don‚Äôt really understand, is this a technique to return to mindfulness? To stop the automatic chatter of the brain? Or does this transition into a daily practice that doesn‚Äôt require stillness? \n\nCan you achieve the same while walking if you‚Äôve practiced enough?\n\nCan u elaborate more on how the results of this technique differ from other techniques when practiced over a longer period of time?\n\nWith Vipassana, which was the one I practiced the most, I had something similar but it was limited and I never \"achieved\" the state of thoughtlessness or mindfulness they preach. Also by looking for the \"gap\" between breaths or the \"gap\" between thoughts (which are the same actually), you miss the whole point, I certainly did. \n\nNext was magic initiation systems (Hermeticism, Theosophical society, etc..), these only feed the mind and open up to the occult. I was not really into rituals, invocations and the spooky stuffs. I wanted to know. That's all. Not just mental knowledge, but actual living touch with reality. Not through a master or a higher being, directly. Any mediator will distort your perception.\n\nNon-Duality/ Vedanta is a good one in my opinion but you can get lost in forms and concepts. It will take long before you can \"arrive\" there and when you do, you will realize all the knowledge you have gathered was useless. (Paradoxically enough, vedanta is supposed to mean \"end of knowledge\")\n\nKabbalah or Jewish mystical tradition was one that caught my interest. Same with hermeticism, a lot of abstract concepts which do not really put you in contact with Self and Source.\n\nThough Krishnamurti was the one that introduced me to real meditation, his views can be pretty dogmatic and misleading.\n\nThanks where should one focus their attention when doing this practice? The body the vibrations or the breath?\n\nWell done on discovering the basic steps of astral projection on your own.\n\nThe visuals you are experiencing is the Hypogynadic State before sleep, the state is often used to induce Lucid dreaming WILD technique.\n\nAlso known as Astral Projection.\n\nAgreed, you have an out of body experience when you do this and it‚Äôs amazing, if you move you mess it up though I find.\n\nSometimes, \"It\" also happens when I go for a walk in the woods near where I live or when I listen to instrumental music. Which makes me think that though it starts with the stillness of the body, it is not exclusive to that.\n\nThis is great, thank you for sharing! I absolutely have been seeing the value of stillness for myself over the past week or so, but keeping the tongue against the roof of my mouth seems like it would be an underrated tip; I just sit and let the drool bubbles drip forth and use that experience to cultivate mindfulness lmao. But I think your suggestion might serve me better üòÇ\n\nMy technique is very simple.  Follow my breath .  Breath in I‚Äôm here, breath out I have arrive.  Thoughts will come and go but I don‚Äôt chase it.  I‚Äôm aware of my sensations and enjoy my breathing.\n\nForrest Knutson on YouTube, some of the best meditation techniques ever.\n\nMy problem is I only can meditate with open eyes otherwise I always fall asleep why is this?\n\nStillness works with this too.  \n\nBe still and know that I am God.\n\nTuning fork medication\n\nYes, good.\n\nGoing to try this method, I‚Äôve been looking for new ways to meditate since I fell off the habit for a year.  Thanks for sharing :)\n\nWhat you describe sounds akin to anapana meditation. Check out Vipassana Meditation by SN Goenka, if you haven't already.\n\nDo you use a mantra to focus?\n\nMy method has similarities but is different too...\n\nIn the late Dr Ainslie Meares method one assumes a nonmoving posture. At the start sitting in a chair will do. Then one experiences global effortless relaxation, a wave of relaxation allows you to go deeper, more relaxation and deeper and then mind slows and stills. In the experience of stillness you know you remain awake and not asleep but thats pretty much it. Afterwards, that is when you know the calm. \n\nWhen learning you can relax different parts of yourself, like they do in \"progressive relaxation\". But that, progressive relaxation, gets in the way of the whole body-mind-spirit experience that is involved in global relaxation. So, when you have the prelimnaries just allowing the wave of relaxation to take you deeper is all that is needed.\n\nNever heard of or considered this. Thank you.¬†\n\nI never once used the breath focus and prefer Zero focus . No need to third eye or anything else, it is called non directive style .We can't reinvent meditation, as it is ancient and was figured out long ago.\n\nWhere what will happen?\n\nGlad you shared this. I‚Äôm going to try this method. Thanks!\n\nThis sounds like first jhana to me. Nice insight!\n\n[removed]\n\nCan you explain the risks / cautions around the khechari mudra? I use it sometimes, but I haven‚Äôt experienced any downsides.¬†\n\nThere is no technique in meditation. It is your very own and depends on how one quietens the mind. This involves effort. One the inner beingness is known you become meditation itself. Hit the quiet state of awareness and forget everything. This state ALLWAYS exists without any obstruction. What is beyond this happens on its own and is effortless. \nWarm regards and best wishes \nSB\n\nWhat do you focus on? Your breath or third eye? Or something else?\n\nI love this. I‚Äôm currently rediscovering meditation and am hoping to heal and overcome my demons. Thank you so much.\n\nStillness is good, just watch out for over efforting in trying to be still and not moving.. that can be an obstacle sometimes. But essentially, the less complicated, the better, 100%.\n\nI get the body vibrations from 30 m of Tibetan bowls but that‚Äôs it, everything else is inaccessible to me. I‚Äôve been told i‚Äôm hard headed\n\nI practice ‚ÄúIl dolce far niente‚Äù anywhere and anytime I can üôèüèº\n\nKeeping the tongue in the roof of the mouth makes me curl the tongue like that? And it gives a weird sensation of breathlessness? Am I doing it wrong?\n\nSounds alot like the visual medition i achieved using a Meditation lamp such as the Loom from LightBath. And you are right; this seems to be one of the most powerful yet gentle meditations one can experience.  I just love it, nice post, thank you for sharing this!\n\nThis is basically what I do. I‚Äôve never followed any set meditation. It‚Äôs just something that seems natural to me.\n\nThat's a beautiful realization! It‚Äôs amazing how stillness can bring such clarity after years of searching. Thanks for sharing, I‚Äôll definitely give it a try!\n\nThe only meditation who work for me is the salat , when i tried this my body feel so confortably relax.\n\nThe other type of meditation i tried not really work , or work less.\n\nWhat your describing is Astral Projection.\n\nCan anyone recommend any particular Krisnamurti content? Preferably linkable? He's only got one little Q&amp;A on Waking Up and it was like less than 5 minutes!\n\nhttps://youtu.be/ojjZut2-fu0?si=YmVgfitapbLyk8LC\n\nThat's where I would start.\n\nThanks!\n\n&gt;Thanks!\n\nYou're welcome!\n\nI thank you for bringing up how stillness can be a meditative point.  My experience has included this as a gateway to my deeper meditative practice.\n\nFor those who may not have grasped the point of stillness, it is not absolute stillness as you do need to breathe, keep your heart beating, and allow internal muscle movements for digestion.  To these unconscious movements, they can be a meditative focal point in one's practice.  Another way to bring stillness into meditative practice is to turn your third eye toward the stillness around you while meditating.  Many movements including sounds in the meditative space grab attention.  For example someone is walking by and you hear the foot falls.  Rather than focus on thespund of the foot hitting the ground, focus on the silence of the foot when not striking the ground.\n\nKeep your practice and thanks again for sharing.\n\nI am doing teh same but after some point, I feel there is intense magnetic pull /pressure around the center of my inside mouth, it is radiating on center of inside head (between the third eye and the top of head)\n\nHas anyone felt the same? Any inputs on this?\n\nHow can you stay still? I keep adjusting my body every 5 seconds if I sit. The only way is to lie down.\n\nHow do you do it?\n\nDo I have to sit or can I just lay down?\n\nWhy do you place your tongue at the roof of your mouth? Would you not be exerting tension to hold your tongue there? Shouldn‚Äôt you just relax it and let it fall naturally wherever it lands?¬†\n\nAre you sure this isn't only working for you because of all of the experience you have prior?\n\nThere's only one way to find out.\n\nPerfect response\n\nThis would be 1st and 2nd Jhana.\nWell done on discovering it yourself. üòä\n\nHave you crossed the bliss?\n\nWhile doing this there are many thoughts coming in my mind so what to do about that and I lost in it\n\nThere is no way to stop those thoughts with force or will. If you try to resist them, you would be using another kind of thought to try to do so, which is only running in circles.\n\nWhat we can do however is to mind your business regardless of their activities. Let them do their thing, you do yours, that is, your concern is only with the complete stillness of the body and the muscles, especially the eyes.\n\nThis is not a mental practice, so don't make it one.\n\nAnother thing that could help is to see that your thoughts are always trying to make sense, to rationalize and to make connections between perceptions and memory. If you can make the body stay still for long enough, these connections will stop.\n\nOkay that's great, can u help me with one more  question\n\nMay I ask you‚Äôve experienced?\n\nMeditation works for most but If meditation isn't working for you then try consciously rewiring your brain during the day. This video explains how: [https://youtu.be/WH1b7Cg-Aw0](https://youtu.be/WH1b7Cg-Aw0)   I see more results this method.\n\nI also believe that slow breathing and keeping my body still is the best approach. For years, I struggled to silence my thoughts, and writings by occultists like Franz Bardon were particularly strict about this, making me blame myself when I couldn‚Äôt achieve it. But then I started having spiritual experiences without silencing my thoughts, and I began questioning why it was considered so essential. In fact, striving to do this seemed only to increase my thoughts. The more I tried for a 'vacancy of mind,' the more my thoughts intensified. Now, I simply try to observe my breath and keep my body still. Sometimes I even do this while standing. My body might move naturally with my breathing‚Äîsmall sways, my shoulders moving up and down. But I think the key is not to move consciously.\n\nThat's right. I have profound respect for master Bardon and the tremendous knowledge he made available through his work. But he tried to systemize something that human constructs cannot grasp. Though he himself always puts \"Divine Providence\" above all, most practitioners get lost in the system rather than striving to merge with the All behind it all, which is what his aim was. \n\nImagine building a road and packing a huge load of bags only to travel back to your starting point...\n\nThere are many people who remain stuck in the initial steps of the system for years; their desire to do everything perfectly turns them obsessive, and I was one of them. Now, however, while following the system, I adapt the practices to suit myself. Perhaps this is a cleverly designed filtering tactic by Bardon.\n\nWait, whatcha mean \"that's when it will happen\"?... what will happen?\n\nThe breath is a gateway to mental focus, I would also highlight. The importance of not 'pushing' away intrusive thoughts. Though, letting them go, like a cloud passing in the sky of your consciousness. Acknowledge it and let it pass by, returning to focus on the breath.   \nThe stillness will never be completely there. You'll practice to the point of intrusive thoughts, coming and just as quickly, going. Or, only peaking over the horizon of your consciousness because you've trained yourself to focus on the breath.\n\nI‚Äôve tried many meditation techniques, but now I stick to one, focusing on my breath. It‚Äôs super simple and works well. I sit quietly, close my eyes, and listen to my inhales and exhales. I gently bring it back to my breathing. No fancy apps or rituals are needed. It‚Äôs helped me feel calmer and less overwhelmed in everyday life. Plus, I can do it anywhere on the bus, before bed, or even during a stressful day at work. Honestly, it‚Äôs my go to for peace of mind.\n\nExercising via weightlifting or yoga could help you to get into deep states faster. Train the physical body and the mind will follow. Pranayama aka breath work helps too.\n\nThis is a lot easier for me after practicing more active ways of meditating and moving energy.\n\nHi, got back into meditating.  Been geeting atavked.  Need help.\n\nThank you. I think I will try that. In the past I have not been able to successfully meditate.\n\n&gt;Now, your eyes should be closed and kept still facing the toward the \"third eye\".\n\nhttps://vm.tiktok.com/ZMhyeJ5yr/\n\nWhat do you intentionally do with your thoughts? Do you try to focus back on the stillness if your mind starts to wander?\n\nI‚Äôm interested to try this. ‚ÄúConcentrate on my breath‚Äù is not how I like to do it.\n\nJust don't pay attention to them. It's none of my concern what thoughts decide to do. As long as they don't interfere with my body and eyes stillness. Let them go where they like. Give attention only to actively keeping still, that's all, the rest will follow.\n\nReally interesting. Thanks. I‚Äôm going to try it for a week.\n\nThank you for the post here OP.  I have been on and off with mixed results.  When I am most successful I tend to stop having thoughts on something I was trying to control like breathing or things that make me comfortable.   I like the idea of just being still as the goal.  Thanks again for the insights.\n\nWhat if you feel pain somewhere? I get a lot of physical pain. Are you really good at ignoring pain?\n\nYou should read about Astral Projection. This is not a trance, but it‚Äôs your body getting in resonance.\n\nbreathing techniques?\n\nI just take a shit ton of drugs and pass out, seems to calm my mind.\n\nBe careful about being so casual and laissez-faire about narcotics - *pease be cautious*!l I loved drugs and thought it was mind over body. But by the time I was in my middle 30's, the drugs took over me. Opiate/opioids,amphetamines, benzos etc. are playing with fire. You can lose a decade before you even realize what's gone. Take it from someone who's been there.\n\nI think Marijuana and mushrooms are worth advocating for, as well as a few other things (we'll see) but the vast majority of stuff people recreational abuse these days is dangerous as all hell!\n\n I guess the sarcasm does not come through the message.   I took a pill in Ibiza, just to prove that I was cool. That was 12 years ago, what happened. ??"

    "body": "Lately I've been thinking and realising... why was I rushing all the time, stressing? Like I'm kinda realising as I meditate more and slow down more ... There's no rush. There's no need to be so stressed out about where my life will lead. Maybe it's not meant to lead anywhere. I'm lucky to even be alive, in this universe, to postulate everything around me.¬† \n\nYeah my childhood was pretty shit, but that's not how it is now. That's all in the past, which is gone and never coming back. It's like a double edged sword. My childhood was awful, and I'll never get that time back - but it's also gone, I'm not there anymore and it can't haunt me again. Even if life gets shit again, that's life. Before, I felt like I was always working to the next thing.\n\n I was always like, what's next? What am I doing? I felt like I had to be doing something.¬† Always achieving. Three degrees, first class law degree, I'm a lawyer now, always aspiring for something. What's the next big thing? But I'm starting to realise... None of that shit really matters to be honest. It never really did. I'm going to die one day, and 50 years after I die, everything I worked towards will be meaningless. I'll be forgotten, and everything I used to stress about will be gone. \n\nEveryone I love is going to die with me, and our time will pass like sand blown in the wind. Everything will be gone. In a strange way, it's liberating. I'm starting to see life for what I should have always seen it as - a gift. I don't need to \"find\" purpose. I AM the purpose. There is no \"route\", because what the fuck is going on üòÇ I'm not supposed to take this shit so serious, nothing matters anyway. There's no destination, or grand finale of finding a pot of gold and jewellry, no crescendo, no \"light bulb\" moment. I AM the moment. The moment is me. Just enjoyment of this privilege of existence. ",

Truly trying to enjoy my life, each day, intentionally. It's a gift.\n\nI give thanks everyday for having an opportunity to exist on planet earth! Our experiences are 1 in 10^2,685,000!\n\nNothing matters. \n\nBecause there is nothing that‚Äôs really important \n\nand that there is such a thing as nothing that literally and figuratively converts itself to matter the second we open our eyes.\n\nOnly important thing is discovering your true self and loving others the way we‚Äôve been taught.\n\n#facts\n\nSecond one üòä\n\nIt‚Äôs both beautiful and depressing. I have yet to come at peace with this.\n\nBuddhism teaches that all life is suffering because  it is transient.  In the Grand Scheme of things, we are just as fleeting as a firefly.\n\nI think it's that all suffering is from attachment to the transient. \n\nWe are the permanent, viewing the temporary. It hurts when we hold on\n\nIt's only depressing if you're holding on to something. That feeling is a good clue and a pointer to what you're holding on to.\n\nDo you mean you‚Äôre at peace with everyone you love eventually dying ?\nI‚Äôm at peace with the life having no particular meaning (except the one you give it)\n\nI‚Äôm at peace with it but not looking forward to it. They won‚Äôt have to suffer anymore and they don‚Äôt mind not being alive.

Energy cannot be destroyed, only converted.¬†\n\nI am looking forward to it but to me that also means I have more to appreciate that I take for granted.\n\nPause.. you‚Äôre looking forward to it?\n\nNot OP, but I find comfort in the idea of final peace.  Assuming that's what we'll find at the light at the end of the tunnel.  That's not a given, of course!\n\nYou wont\n\n&gt;why was I rushing all the time, stressing?\n\nThis thought plagues me a lot and yet I keep continuing doing the same things. It is really hard to not stress when I have bills to pay on the first of every month and no stable job or career.\n\nI understand your concerns and they are of course valid. An enlightened perspective would see these bills as another aspect of legitimate suffering that is a part of your current life experience. You can learn from it by just looking at it without judgement, realizing that it is changing simply by observing it, letting it be knowing it will come to pass. All things come to pass. Life is impermanent but you can choose to be thankful in this life now.\n\nI hope your finances become better soon.\n\nThank you for your kind words.\n\nI hope you are doing better. You're very welcome.\n\nI am in a better place. Thank you.\n\nJust checking in. It's good to know you're doing better, hanging in there. Keep going.\n\nThank you. I'm mentally in a much better place.\n\nFantastic, that's great to know.\n\nI'm in the boat but still happy because I don't want anything. I don't even have a home or pay rent or a mortgage! I don't have anything but I'm okay and I live very happily.  The happiest people I know have the least the most miserable people I know have the most. I know life in the United States is very difficult.\n\nI was evicted from my apartment in 2023 and I was forced to let go of basically all my thi gs except what I can fit in my car. Once it was over and done with and I lost all these things I felt a huge weight off my chest just not having to worry about all these materialistic things. It was that moment that I realized that less is more in this life and As an American I realized our way of living is unsustainable and contributes to our suffering.\n\nOr another way I put it:  I might be homeless but I've been to 30 beaches this year. ;)\n\nCongratulations! That's a major achievement! \nFor me it was becoming a nomad and I couldn't take my stuff with me. And then the stuff I could take with me like the Red Sox I had to let that go too. \n\nBut I'll always love the Red Sox. That's part of my Bliss and part of who I am. I saw The Steal (ALCS 2004, Game 4) and the only World series clincher at Fenway. To me those were a gift from God. I only made one bet in my life and it was that the Red Sox would win the World Series that year.\n\nAnd literally everything is costing more and more. Like why? Life is too damn expensive üò© can't even enjoy it anymore.\n\nTell me about it. Even basic stuff sometimes is so expensive, and USA not having a Max Retail Price makes it even more annoying.\n\nüíØ\n\nThe thing that I have been interested in with this, as well as general philosophical ideas surrounding the ephemeral state of things, is the future. Planning for the future. Investing in the future. Why even care at all if we could get zapped into nothingness before we see the next sunrise? However I think it's a balancing act, and planning for the future is still a necessity to some extent if you want to fulfill certain desires in this life -- achieve certain things. Yet also reminding yourself, it doesn't matter in terms of permanence. It's a part of the game we voluntarily choose to partake in. We know it's all for naught, however we participate for the interest and entertaining curiosity of what comes next.\n\nThat is why the life of a Monk in some countries is easier, I guess, because the culture supports their life style of hours a day meditating.........but also, this involves Maslow's Hierarchy of needs. If all our basic needs are met, such as food, shelter, safety, companionship, etc........... [https://www.simplypsychology.org/maslow.html](https://www.simplypsychology.org/maslow.html) it is part of the path. The Buddha admitted that the middle way was best as far as meeting our basic needs and how that is a necessary support.........\n\nRetirement also plagues my thoughts\n\nThe over-achieving bit comes from childhood trauma. Becoz we didn't receive unconditional love, we are constantly trying to prove our worth through achievements which are never enough. Hence the \"what's next\" . I'm a lawyer too and had a shitty childhood. Same experience.\n\nEverything you just said is so true. I overachieved to prove my worth, that I am worthy, that I deserve love. I felt like my usefulness translated my worth. The goal post kept moving.\n\nI'm turning 30 next year and only now am I realising that I am enough. My friends could be homeless and poverty stricken and I'd still love them. I'm learning to extend that same compassion to myself. I don't need a first class law degree, two scholarships, a masters degree and a published paper to prove any of that. I'm super proud of myself for it, but in the end, it wasn't necessary.\n\nYou've done so well. I don't mean the academic achievements- those don't matter. But reaching this level of self-compassion and wisdom at 30? Wow! I did it at 56 :) üòÄ\n\nI think the overachieving bit comes from just us copying each other. It's very cultural. As a world traveler I see how hard people work in different cultures. You can take a train from Spain to Switzerland and see that people work much harder in Switzerland and are much more uptight about it. I'm not saying one is better then the other but people live in different ways. Even in America if you go to Miami people aren't working as hard as they are in Massachusetts. In Japan people work really hard. Why? Because everyone expects everyone else to work really hard you were letting everyone down if you're not working as hard as everyone else. In America we're not so formal about that but it's still true. \n\nAdd on to that that people have lost the north star of morality and kindness and the North Star is now money and so to feel good about yourself you have to compete and earn.\n\nCopying others derails us from our true individual path. We stop listening to ourselves and become unable to follow our bliss. That‚Äôs the tragedy for most people.\n\nExactly right. This is the main problem of our time.\n\nYou get it. It‚Äôs all invented. All of it is made up. And your experience is happening inside your own head. Thats all you can know - what your senses tell you. And your senses are bullshit. You‚Äôve glimpsed the truth. Life is still gonna suck. But you actually get it.\n\n\"Life is suffering\"\n\nAnd it doesn‚Äôt matter that life is suffering.\n\nThe often overlooked piece.\n\nFinding the truth and then stripping it of any significance is the critical step. \n\n‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt matter that I know this - its not profound. In the natural world, this is unimportant.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúAn eyeless bug swimming in rat shit and dog piss in the gutter of an alleyway understands this better than I do,‚Äù is such a beautifully crushing realisation.\n\nThere is nothing underfoot. There never was or will be.\n\nThe truth of our experience is emptiness - the space between breaths. We die, become nothing, and resurrect ourselves with every heart beat. \n\nLurching and pulsing. \n\nPulling and pushing.\n\nDeath to life and back again.\n\nAll the while ignoring that equanimity is a form of non-existence, a ‚Äúnothing‚Äù.\n\nThat‚Äôs why everyone misses it - everyone is searching for ‚Äúsomething‚Äù.\n\nYou have let it go. And then let it go that you‚Äôve let it go.\n\nAnd in the end...we just return. Ceaselessly beating and lapping on the cosmic beach of time...going in and out...in and out.\n\nGiggity.\n\nheh. haha. hehahahaha! okay, a philosophical dissemination of reality's perplexing nature and our human struggle to make sense of the grandeur that is existence... then giggity. \n\ni love it.\n\nyes, because everything is an illusion of the limited human mind, sense-organ network.\n\nIt could be an illusion. Or it could be truth. Either way, we can‚Äôt really know. We have no objective senses. The mind is always helping.\n\nboth mind and senses are limited\n\nIt's actually Desire is Suffering. You can live life happily without desire. Desire is suffering because either you don't get it and you suffer or you get it and then want something more. You can never win.\n\nIt all comes down to non-attachment. Not just to suffering and happiness, but even to the idea of non-attachment itself.\n\nYes. And yet seeking non-attachment is a paradox because whatever I chase has me. I‚Äôm owned by it. So I wonder if practicing is more about mastering the art of doing nothing. Doing / Nothing. Doing. Nothing. What is happening or rather not happening when I‚Äôm doing nothing? I sometimes think knowing the answer to that question is more helpful than practice.\n\nHappiness is a feeling and feelings are impermanent. It‚Äôs like sleep. If we‚Äôre really precise around our behaviour we can sleep a little deeper, a little longer but we can‚Äôt sleep indefinitely - eventually we have to wake up.\n\nI teach suffering because when you learn the truth nature of suffering, you learn how to suffer less\n\nThis feels true but I‚Äôve never seen it. The spiritual path is awash with suffering - soaked in it. We just frame it as devotion and everyone agrees because we want to believe there is away out when there almost certainly isn‚Äôt. We‚Äôre doomed to be confronted with our own bullshit indefinitely.\n\nYou're talking about spiritual bypassing, or as I like to call it, spiritual gaslighting. Suffering is, that's the first noble truth. But people always stop there. Cultivating Right View means that you look deeply into suffering and see that suffering can not exist without well-being. They are a pair of opposites. Well-being exists, that is the third noble truth. Suffering can not exist without wellbeing. Any other view is wrong view and you have not heard the lesson of the buddha\n\nPain is inevitable, but suffering is a choice.\n\nidk, I am going to take the Buddha's word when he says 'Life is suffering'\n\nThats just one perspective.\n\nIt's Siddharta Gautama's perspective, and many have come to perceive it as truth.\n\nBut if you've not run into it before then someone just saying \"life is suffering\" would be pretty misleading. It's not as miserable as that suggests! [https://tricycle.org/beginners/buddhism/four-noble-truths/](https://tricycle.org/beginners/buddhism/four-noble-truths/)\n\nLife may be suffering, but you dont need to suffer.\n\nI don't like the \"suffering\" translation. In my understanding \"dissatisfaction\" is more accurate.\n\nRegardless, it is nice that we can do something about it!\n\nMaybe you don‚Äôt need to but you‚Äôll never escape it. It‚Äôs a core mechanism of being human.\n\nAh, but its my body that suffers, its not me.\n\nThat is the Buddha's perspective. the first thing that being says in his first sermon is Life is suffering. which I appreciate because directly hits the heart of the matter.\n\nIn life, there IS suffering.\n\n[removed]\n\nThe longer you meditate the more you'll take that feeling with you throughout the day.\n\nThis. I'm human so I still freak out sometimes, but I remember to just focus on my breath. That seems to work.\n\nMe too!\n\n‚ÄúI am‚Äù\n\nAmen brother\n\nYay! Very aligned to how meditation has changed me, as well.  I don't think we can truly be content or at peace with life until we've accepted this. \n\nIt's not really meditation-related, but for anyone that resonates with this post and is struggling with these feelings like \"I feel like I always need to be doing/achieving something,\" I highly recommend the book Four Thousand Weeks.\n\nYour conditioning/trauma‚Äôs from the past have a very real influence in the present moment though. It‚Äôs not ‚Äúgone‚Äù because you‚Äôve found some peace in the present moment.\n\nYou will return to them over and over if you do not heal from them.\n\nI agree, that's why facing the truth of your past is the pathway to freedom. I did it, and became liberated. It took several years, perhaps a decade in total, and I'm still doing it, but I can finally taste the liberation.\n\nEverything I do in this life is up to me, whether consciously or not. Including having the strength to overcome it. Either you overcome trauma or it overcomes you, there are no other options. You need certain tools to overcome it. For me, those tools were counselling, psychotherapy and cognitive behavioural therapy spanning over a decade. Also journalling, exercising, yoga, meditation, art, embroidery, Brazilian jiu jutsu, exercise and solid friends, also quitting drugs. \n\nI didn't really grasp the statement \"the truth will set you free\" until I lived it. A simple phrase but a true one indeed.\n\n The most beautiful , profound post I've EVER read on here \nThank you \n\nI was a nurse for 33 years \nThe last ten years in hospice nursing and it was what I loved doing \nI was an underachiever .. only 4 years college . \" i should have done more \" is what played in my mind on repeat in the past few years .  My children are grown now and I am alone \nYour post helped me immensely \nPs I have been meditating now for a few months \nI will never ( not ) meditate and it is interesting that only recently have I thought, \"In 100 years we ( my two children and I will be forgotten about etc ) \"you said it more eloquently . \n\nAnyway .. I thank you :)\n\nsaving this for the next thing i get pissed off about smth in life, so i can read this and remember whatever im trippin over ain‚Äôt shit üíÄ\n\nI‚Äôd add the nuance that while I agree nothing matters that you do in the long run relative to your life, it can matter in terms of down stream effects on the future of how the universe plays out. However small that impact may be.\n\nAlso, in the moment, things matter if you choose to have them matter.¬†\n\nMy son matters to me immensely. My wife matters to me immensely. I don‚Äôt dwell on the fact we will all be dust one day. I don‚Äôt dwell on the fact that years ago we were dust. I just focus on appreciating and loving the time I have with them now because that is what MATTERS to me.¬†\n\nI find this perspective helps me find the joy and appreciation of temporal existence. I‚Äôm allowed to let things matter to me since I don‚Äôt dwell on the future too much.¬†\n\nA yogi once told me, \"Find meaning in one thing and you will find meaning in everything.\"\n\nMattering is an arbitrary decision at the end. For me it matters to have an engaging and joyful experience of challenge and growth, even though it's as if nothing actually happened\n\nI resonate with your story OP, I also had a difficult childhood leading to being a high achiever always rushing and pushing to get to the next thing. \n\nSince I started my awakening journey in 2020, I‚Äôve gone through so many cycles of letting go of old ways of being that were not in alignment with my true nature as a conscious being.\n\nAt this point, I feel very lucky to have navigated to a place where I can bring more of who I truly am (all parts of me) to more of my life. \n\nIf we‚Äôre here and nothing matters, might as well enjoy it as much as we can, right?\n\nYou have a very good point. The ego seeks to rule in part by creating defense mechanisms, a chief one being distraction. Attachment to the world, the things of the world, the values of the world, hence the education and career are chief among the distractions. There are other more obvious ones like addiction of course. \n\nJesus said something to the effect of, \"We are IN the world, but not OF the world.\" To be in the world we have to work to maintain physical life, but that need not be the sum of our identity. \n\nYou may choose to remain a lawyer, or not. It depends on how much that becomes a distraction. The enlightened of the East typically don't work at all, but those societies value them and they can subsist on donations. Here in the US, that's usually a downward spiral into homelessness and despair. It is the rare traveler that can descend into that abyss and remain unscathed.  However, you are unlikely to do that. With lawyer money you could just buy a couple of franchises that don't require hands on management.\n\nIt's not a problem to lawyer ethically. That's right livelihood. You can be in the world as a lawyer and still not of the world depending on how you treat the situation. But I guess \"lawyer ethically\" is a contradiction in terms. ;) I hate lawyers. Would love to meet one good person who is a lawyer, I know there are many.\n\nI agree. Good ethics can be practiced in most professions.\n\nThe past is never coming back, I love that. I agree none of this matters, it‚Äôs all about love and only love.\n\nGreat post. Just enjoy existing. Take pleasure in all of life‚Äôs beauty and don‚Äôt let yourself get caught up in the bullshit.\n\nOptimistic nilalism or what you spell it. So happy for you dude !! Wish I was there myself you're an inspiration. Greetings from Denmark üíì\n\nI am living in a third world country rushing to study in a first world country. My family can't afford so I have to get a scholarship. I used to be a smart student but I screwed things up in the final year of high school, thanks to which I am now in a university where I have never ever wanted to be. I don't fit in this environment, everyday I knew I was better than this, way much. Most friends I had are studying in the US or Canada and I feel like I am being looked down on. And I really am, by my relatives.\n\nThese days I can't get myself to do anything, I have become mentally tired. I have this huge desire to end this and build my life again. Been few weeks or months that I can't somehow find my peace. Everyday I am in between a constant pace and anxiety.\n\nHowever, reading this post has helped me somehow, that worrying itself won't be helpful but leads me to a lot of mental issues \n\nThank you for the post. May you be free from enmity, may you be pink in health.\n\nHey, I'm from a third-world country too, and have been in the same situation as well. I have been working in a common job, and the pressure of finishing my graduation makes me feel really bad. \n \nI started a graduation that I didn't want just to impress my family. Life is cruel most times and in my country things are hard to get. Meditation somehow makes me understand that everything that is is. Everything is in the right place, nothing is missing and nothing is left. By the way, I'm really happy and in the end, this is the only thing that matters! Hoping you find your way in this life üôè\n\nI'm glad to hear how comforting this perspective is to you. Accepting that life is temporary can help us see many things in a less stressful and more meaningful way.\n\nI needed thisü´∂üèæüôåüèæ\n\nThank you, I needed this. The constant stressing about moving up in my career life and how to do better, stressing about what next and how I should grow and I too am starting to realize that the stresses of the modern world are unnatural for our body and mind and its all artificial at the end of the day. Stressing about life, and money, and all these invented things is no way to live our life, especially as short as it is. I just hope one day I can make \"None of this matters\" apart of my daily practice and thought and just maybe start to truly enjoy life the way it is meant to be  lived.\n\nWabi Sabi my friend, wabi sabi :)\n\nSo, there‚Äôs a difference in being a a nihilist, and being depressed. Not having motivation or accepting nothing really matters seems more like a sign of depression than a quality of life statement. \n\nI‚Äôm a nihilist.  Ultimately yes, nothing really matters in the end. Following that to the nth degree misses the point though. We still have these pesky emotions and instinctive drives that live with us, and it‚Äôs ok to accept and embrace them.\n\nIf you have and you‚Äôre fine with nothingness and just kinda existing, that‚Äôs ok! You live your life the way you want. Just be careful not to fall into the depression trap. It‚Äôs a slippery slope.\n\nWell said! You are exactly right. What is a gift is the fact you realized it before the end! You know what life is really about and now you get to live it! That is an awesome feeling!! \n\nI am glad to know there are others out there that think like me because it seems the world is so bleak these days. People are meandering through life worried about status, money and power. For what? You‚Äôre right, it is meaningless. I can only hope others will have this realization in their lifetime because it is true PEACE! Reading this today inspires me and really put a smile on my face! \n\nMust say meditation IS and has been pivotal in getting there. Meditation grounds you and puts life into perspective and teaches you what is really important in life. Everyone would benefit. Imagine if everyone meditated! Our world would be a better place that‚Äôs for sure!\n\nIsn't wonderful when u realize we create our own prison and u step out of it and its constraints!\n\nThank you. Can you share tips on how you meditate please?\n\nFocus on your breath. Take deep breaths in and deep breaths out and really focus your attention on that. I find that breath work helps me a lot :)\n\nThank you!\n\nWhat an amazing mindset you have created for yourself! 35 years out of an emotionally abusive marriage and an emotionally abusive mother before that‚Ä¶I sincerely hope I can build this for myself over time. Congratulations to you!\n\nWhat are the chances, I also had an emotionally abusive mother. \n\nI had to take charge of my life and cut her off. Once I understood that I'm an adult and everything was within my grasp, I took charge of my life. I cut her out.\n\nI believe we've found the real life Julian Mantle here.\n\nit teaches you detachment. next level you will learn detachment from yourself\n\nlove you\n\nBeautiful. Thanks for sharing. I needed to hear this today.\n\nSaving this to read again and again and again! So very true!\n\nnothing truly matters. and you can easily realize it by just thinking about what you did yesterday, do you remember anything at all about yesterday? today is your yesterday tomorrow, so if you don‚Äôt care about yesterday because time is passing by and tomorrow will be new so due to this the best thing to truly do is whatever the fuck you want the math do be mathin\n\nIt was mostly the FBI and Antifa..... but the ppl locked up are political prisoners who need freed!\n\nI'm always worried when I believe this to the core that the rest of my life will just fly by lightning fast\n\nIt will. That's why you should be present for it :)\n\nWow I really needed to see this today, very comforting\n\nThat's a nihilist take though dude, you're getting lost in the semantics / words / explanations and it's pulling you away from one key thing that you've missed - love!\n\n\nWe do what we can to make ourselves capable of great things so we can build a lovely environment for those around us and those who come after us.\n\n\nThis is the greater use of our ability and wisdom.¬†\n\n\nWithout this, there would be no hospitals, no lawyers to protect justice, no teachers to educate the children etc.\n\n\nWhat matters or doesn't matter isn't the focus, what good you can do for others and for the love of yourself and others who are ultimately you in the end, this is a great thing to pursue.\n\n\nSo this can be your purpose. It's a truer outlook than nothing matters, we all die anyway.\n\n\nThere is no death. There is no birth. It's all an illusion at the end. A rising and falling.\n\n\nBut this experience right here right now, is something we can all embrace and use to experience and share love to one another.\n\n\nPeace and love to you buddy and good luck along the rest of your journey!¬†\n\nThe sun gives nourishment to the world.\n\n\nThe water gives nourishment to the creatures.\n\n\nThe people give endless nourishment to each other and have the capacity to do the same to the environment and everything else.\n\n\nThe top 2 know their purpose and fulfill it, the 3rd one gets confused from time to time¬†\n\nIf you want an eye opener, go stay in sub-saharan Africa for a few weeks and work with a charity. Your depth of understanding of suffering and frame of view will change significantly. Then you'll see the question change from \"what's the point of this\" to \"what can I do to help my friends\"\n\nSo all of that go go go, do do do energy you've suffered has moulded you into a lawyer. That's great. Now you can use your abilities to greatly help others. This is the point I'm trying to make.\n\n\"I am the purpose.\"\n\"The moment is me.\"\nWow, what a beautiful post!\nGod bless you. I wish you luck on this beautiful journey of yours.\n\nOne thing matters: being a good person. \n\nEveryone has their own definition but just strive to be your best\n\nIf only more people would think like this !!! I 100% agree with your mindset right now . Good for you for finding that within yourself ! It's not easy and not everyone can understand or experience this mindset.\n\n:)\n\nJust beautifully described something that i lately have been thinking of\n\nTHIS. I concur ü´∂üèº\n\nStanding ovation for you!\n\nThat's a great insight to hit. But it's not the end. \n\nAll the BS that used to seem important is seen as BS. All this striving to become something or make something for what? It'll fall apart eventually.\n\nBut that doesn't mean values don't exist or that your actions don't have consequences and impact at all.  That would be falling into existential nihilism or absurdism which most of modernity is seeped in. But that's a dead end and it's not true.\n\nKeep going to see what does matter even if it doesn't have the same taste of desperate eternal striving.\n\nBravo and well stated about I AM the purpose!\n\nThe amount of erroneous belief (illusion) I shed through meditation is the gift that keeps on giving.\n\nYep yep, these are facts. I feel the same way. I‚Äôve been meditating for years now and I used to just stress so much now idc. I left a job of 6 years in June and now I make way less then I used to and right now I‚Äôm okay with how things have slowed down for me because at the same time I‚Äôve gotten more opportunities to be apart of things that I actually care about this entire year. I learned how to be better with money since I hardly had any and to be more resourceful with things I already have. Like you said I AM PURPOSE.\n\nWe were all unwilling participants when we came to exist in this life, and there is nothing wrong with simply *being* - to simply exist without meaning or attachment. The more I practice, the more my mind and body comes to accept this fact.\n\nAmen, brother.\n\ni agree with all the sentiment of that, and would add an extra possibility - that you may come to some type of spiritual path and some type of liberation/enlightenment as a 'pot of gold'? its not for everyone, but i think when people get to finally throwing off all of that worldy 'fluff', that other/spiritual side can come to the fore. E.g. in daoism they call it the 'red dust' - as in all of those things we get drawn into etc in life, end up blowing away like dust.\n\nSo does that mean reincarnation doesnt exist?\n\nI don't know, I'll never know, and I'm not banking on knowing. I'll just enjoy what I have right now.\n\nI read what you wrote. can recommend something - if you don't mind.\n\nread about NDE - and listen on YouTube to people who experienced it. It will change something in you, and will give a hint about the meaning of all this. you choose who you are.\n\nnothing matters, but everything is still up for grabs\n\ni still wanna live in my own house with a decent amount of land and no neighbors near me, so im still going to work towards that but im no longer working in the old way of working, im working in alignment with the way that will get me to that reality\n\nbut even as i align with that goal, im still having fun and enjoying each moment leading up to there even if what appears on the surface may not exactly appear the way i want it to be\n\nIt only matters ‚Ä¶ if we choose to make it matter ‚Ä¶\n\nNothing is a problem and it feels great\n\nThe trees you planted can be enjoyed for centuries by humans and animals, long after the last person that remembered your name has died of old age\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/nonduality/s/4PFVlE7LpR\n\nThat's right, that's why the confusing media so desperately tries to make you worry about all the possible horror scenarios they create, to keep you afraid or enslaved, but it really only matters what we want it to matter, so I hope we care. have a good time, love each other and be free from fears\n\nüëèüèºüëèüèºüëèüèº\n\nYou are lucky if you are never haunted by an awful childhood. I think it is normal to accept with compassion that stuff will come up no matter how much we have come to terms with it.\n\nAlso, for me it is important to have done something to make the world a better place for the generations that come after me for humans, all sentient beings, the Earth and beyond........even if just small actions of kindness.........and admitting to our mistakes.......with compassion........and our feelings may not always be pleasant all the time......what is is........imo\n\nIt doesn‚Äôt it just teaches us never hold on to anything. Especially negative feeling. Because you have to let go of the bad to make room for the good.\n\nThe loss of hope. Learning to find the beauty in it is what I‚Äôve been really focusing on lately. It can be sad and it can also be so freeing.\n\nMate is a biological issue you have stress built inside you it's a defence mechanism it is good üëçüëçüëç you will stress one way or another as the more society advances we exposed to chemicals and is the new environment that kind of messes with that basic defence mechanism in a different way than evolution intended it to be we are not 2000 years ago where thugs would burn down villages and there we wild animals in the jungle/ forest were that sistem would work properly everything is pretty safe for 99% of people in modern world so unless you live in a village where you hunt and have a hunter gatherer lifestyle close  to nature you are in a dilemma \nWelcome to the world üåéüåéüåé\n\n&gt;I'm not supposed to take this shit so serious, **nothing matters anyway**.\n\nOh it does matter. Your happiness matters. Just because phenomena is impermanent, doesn't mean that nothing matters anymore. Whether you gonna suffer or not is of prime importance to you. Whether you are going to remain be trapped in the cycle of *samsara* or you're going to end it certainly does matter!\n\nNihilism is a good start to reduce the **care for the world** but it doesn't give any positive solution to existential suffering. In my experience, a good place to start reducing your suffering is cultivation of positive thoughts. In other words, *metta*. It certainly does matter whether you're full of positive thoughts or negative shit. The quality of your life depends on the quality of your thoughts.\n\nStep 1. Don‚Äôt sweat the little shit.\n\nStep 2. It‚Äôs *all* little shit.\n\nNote: there may be a noticeable time gap between Steps 1 and 2. :-)\n\nwell put\n\nSpot on , mate üëå\n\nDeep stuff man\n\nIt doesn't really matter :)\n\nReally needed to hear this, at this moment\nThank you\n\nBeautiful insights! But also still cool what you have achieved. Everything can be evaluated on its own without comparison to anything else for any reason. \n\nYou know what it took for you to get where you are today, it's not meaningless to YOU. It's a testament to your strength and abilities. You can appreciate it without being attached to it. The middle way.\n\nIt‚Äôs meaningful to strive toward something that will leave a legacy. Abandon the thought that you are your own individual self and embrace that you are a catalyst that fuels a much larger mechanism. This mechanism keeps building and evolving the society we have. We will leave a gift of inventions, technologies , art for the future lot to live on. Each of us is a tiny block that is needed to achieve this. Everyone and everything matters.\n\nHow do u meditate ?\n\nI do some calming breathwork as a meditate. Helps me get in the zone. I also focus on my breathing.\n\nI‚Äôve never needed to read this more than right now.\n\nHave all read: complex ptsd: from surviving to thriving. Pete Wilson. I highly recommend for c-ptsd from childhood.\n\n:)\n\n\"I don't need to find purpose. I am the purpose.\" Love that, it is so true. We are constantly on the move looking for the next thing to make meaning of, when in reality just being ourselves and doing the things we want to do is already enough meaning.\n\nHell I coulda told you that\n\nNothing matters because mankind has lost their way. Jesus is the only way. He is the truth and the light. Every  knee shall bow to him. Make a joyful noise to the Lord.\n\nWell put.\n\nReminds me of my favorite movie office space\n\nBut if you are responsible for someone else and if things are not going well, how can one stop trying to fix the situation even though it is so hard.\n\n‚ÄúOne day,¬†in retrospect,¬†the years of struggle¬†will strike you as the most beautiful.‚Äù¬†\n\nSigmund Freud\n\nYou are so right on!!!! This physical plane we are in is so temporary. I learned I'm here to love others and myself. That's all there is. Embrace the good and bad of living and fall in love with life. There's more to come. Thank you for your post.¬†\n\nSaving this"

    "all_comment_text": "&gt; Michael Ceely once spent a four-hour flight just zoning out ‚Äì no magazines, no movies, no podcasts, just looking out the window and watching the flight map.\n\nMan does nothing for 4 hours; journalist writes an article about the \"trend\" for a major news outlet.\n\n/r/nottheonion\n\n4 hours isn‚Äôt even a long flight\n\nI'm too lazy to even get my book for that short of a flight. \n\nAlso I didn't have an isp for two months but you didn't hear me bragging about it everywhere. I'm glad to have the web back, and don't need to \"detox\" because I already enjoy daydreaming and being present.\n\nSame\n\nTrue this - after decades of being a road warrior and flying across the US, I now live in Hawaii and if I'm heading to the mainland, 4 hrs doesn't even get me to another state! \n\nNo books, just a window seat, my down travel blanket, hooded neck pillow and the flight tracker.\n\nOh yeah, it's crazy how big the Pacific is. But for real though, I often don't do anything on a flight. Something about being crammed into a giant soda can make me not want to do anything. So I end up daydreaming for hours, which is fitting as I'm a writer / artist. \n\nI do catch myself checking what other people are watching, but that's more curiosity than boredom. So many people are entertained too much, and don't get that alone time with themselves.\n\n[deleted]\n\nPilot here. If you were gonna die you‚Äôd be dead already ü´°ü´° jk jk \n\nIdk if you‚Äôre in the US but the last thing any major corporation wants is their plane to fall out the sky or any engineering company to get sued because they didn‚Äôt build the plane properly. Also the US has the safest airspace for commercial travel and 99% safety rating. \n\nAlso back when I was flying for the airlines did everything we can to avoid turbulence to help comfort the passengers . \n\nWhen I was learning how to fly in smaller planes . The turbulence in those was real fear . Imagine being rocked around in a bathtub with wings off the coast of California at night. Shit my pants a lot. \n\nBut really. To Give you some good advice . Whether you believe god the universe whenever it get bumpy just think: \n\n‚Äúgod wouldn‚Äôt do me this dirty, I‚Äôm just trying to get to ___ destination I only have ___ (hours / minutes left)___ I can‚Äôt wait to see ___ (people or places) when I land .‚Äù\n\nIt‚Äôs almost like mental affirmations. Another good one is like \n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm not the only person on this plane right now and the pilots have trained for moments like this ‚Äú\n\nI say this because when I was flying alone at night in Cessnas (the scariest or most peaceful  time to depending on the weather) there is nothing scarier to think that you‚Äôll have to endure a tragedy alone. \n\nSo I‚Äôd say don‚Äôt be afraid to speak out your fears to other people / therapist or other passengers. 90% of people are nice and not assholes from what I‚Äôve perceived. Also a lot of your fear is because lack of exposure . The more you do something the less frightening. Now I‚Äôm not saying just buy all the tickets . But it‚Äôs one of those things that emphasize the destination over the journey. \n\nI kind of just dumped a bunch on you but here‚Äôs a TLDR\n\nTLDR : you‚Äôll be fine I‚Äôm a former airline pilot you‚Äôre not gonna fall out the sky use positive words of affirmation or encouragement to combat negative feelings.\n\nGreat advice! \n\nI was a HS senior in Chicago's NW 'burbs when the DC10 crash occurred ('79) and I had flown dozens of flights with my parents since the age of 6 and wanted to fly for a living.\n\nThe horror of that event turned me into a young adult petrified of flying, no - crashing.\n\nYear later I found myself in a corporate road warrior job, flying every week for months on end from DCA to SFO, from a home base of ORD. I'll admit, the first flight leaving MKE in a snowstorm, I grabbed a couple adult beverages on the company tab. \n\nIn 10 yrs of mimicking George Clooney's role in \"Up in the Air\", I had 2 truly memorable flights where I thought I was gonna die, but I also became a pro at sleeping thru anything in an airport or on a plane.\n\nFlying a LOT cured my fear of flying, just like dying 3.5 yrs ago of a heart attack also cured me of my fear of death. \n\nEven the worst flight is nothing compared to a widowmaker heart attack, resuscitation and a 3 week coma on advanced life support. \n\nI live in Hawaii now and we fly to neighbor islands like it's hopping into a lyft or uber.\n\n*If you were gonna die you‚Äôd be dead already - NO joke.*\n\nRight, like if you have to drive a car for four hours you‚Äôre essentially doing the same thing\n\nHave you tried meditation? 4 solid hours zoning out is quite an accomplishment IMO.\n\nzoning out ‚â† meditation\n\nI rawdogg all the time on my flights from NRT to YVR. It‚Äôs at least 10 hrs. As long as I get an exit row seat and leg room, I can rawdog all flight.¬†\n\nYeah, anything under 8 is a cake walk.\n\npeople run out of things to do so they start doing nothing. it‚Äôs the natural evolution of society.\n\nwow honestly a sad accomplishment of todays sapiens\n\nno you‚Äôre wrong doing something and zoning out are both equally irrelevant\n\nInteresting that the world is so full of distraction that looking out the window is a cultural movement.\n\nFor real! A few months ago I had someone yell out their window ‚ÄúAre you okay‚Äù? Because they saw me sitting upright outside on a bench with my eyes closed. I was trying to meditate. All I could think was Wow I guess people think something must be wrong if you‚Äôre just sitting still without staring at a screen now ü§®\n\nBeing without purpose is culturally unsettling in the west.\n\nNot only in the west, it's not like India and Saudi countries are still full of yogis and meditators lol, most people there are on their phones watching TikTok too. (Well not in India bc tiktok is banned lol)\n\nIndeed. Thailand is the most heads down screen absorbed country I've ever experienced. Such a shame as previously it had one of the most vibrant street life cultures.\n\nThe infection spreads.\n\nYeah Indian is the biggest nationality I work with, spend months at a time with people from India and very very few of them are at all spiritual. The vast majority are just like your average westerner, many even more self-absorbed.\n\n100%!!!\n\nWhen I worked retail, I would meditate outside by sitting on a bench and watching people and cars pass by during my breaks. I got multiple. I got multiple comments from my coworkers about how weird it was, when they would use the same benches to be on their phones during lunch.¬†\n\nUgh üòë Some people are just terrified to be alone with their thoughts for 5 seconds.\n\nMe. It‚Äôs me, I am terrified of it, hahaha! I used to meditate a lot, hence still being on this sub, but these days I truly can‚Äôt. So I can confirm, with no phone the horrors come back!\n\nSomeone was concerned about you and checked on you.   This is nice.\n\nI appreciated the gesture, it definitely was nice, but I *also* felt it spoke volumes about what people assume about stillness and focus now.\n\nYeah it‚Äôs a good look for the individual, a bad look for society\n\nWell, perhaps it speaks volumes about the sheer number of depressed, unhappy, despondent and suicidal people there are these days. But I take your point¬†\n\nFeels like an Idiocracy moment\n\nMe too! I was reading a book at the airport and they called security on me. They thought I was suspicious because I wasn‚Äôt faceballing a smartphone.\n\nOr, maybe it‚Äôs nice that someone cared enough to check you are ok?\n\nDamn I was suprised also\n\n\nWe live in a strange times indeed, where normal things are suprising and seem impossible to general public\n\nSo interesting that there are people who would actively eschew things like meditation and mindfulness as foofy Eastern nonsense, yet those same people would entertain those same ideas if they were instead framed as competitive and described using sexually connoted language.\n\nCan you imagine one such person going to a Zen monastery and saying \"these monks are raw-dogging pretty hard\"\n\nHold onto your nuts buckaroos, we are raw dogging enlightenment here!\n\nthis made me laugh out loud - thank you for that\n\n[deleted]\n\nGen Z here. We'd say that too, although we're old enough now to have a filter and not use slang at a monastery lol.¬†\n\n\n\"Raw dogging ___\" didn't have sexual connotations to me growing up, we used it all the time for... Idk how to explain it... But like \"grinning and bearing\" it? Not preparing or getting unusual comforts, but just going for it and pushing through. Exactly like going on a flight without entertainment.\n\n\nI think a lot of Gen Z slang is like that. I had a teacher in middle school who was on the border between Gen X and Millennial, and he'd laugh hysterically at everything we'd say. Apparently all of our innocuous slang, even stuff as innocent as \"that's lit\", all meant sex and drugs back in his day. ¬Ø‚Å†\\‚Å†_‚Å†(‚Å†„ÉÑ‚Å†)‚Å†_‚Å†/‚Å†¬Ø¬†\n\n[deleted]\n\nHaha! That's fascinating! I suppose it makes sense - the newer generation tries to copy the \"older kids\", but uses it in their own, more innocent day-to-day situations.\n\njust grinding towards enlightenment-maxing\n\nEdging consciousness\n\nEnlightenmaxing\n\nIt‚Äôs actually been a while since I‚Äôve hear anyone mock meditation and mindfulness. The most negative thing I‚Äôve heard the past few years is, ‚ÄúI wish I could do it but it‚Äôs too hard,‚Äù or, ‚ÄúI know I should be doing it.‚Äù\n\nWe‚Äôve thankfully reached the stage where we know the screens are bad for us, it‚Äôs just so hard to get break the addiction. If framing it like unprotected sex and writing an outlandish article gets some people interested in mindfulness, I say it‚Äôs a good thing!\n\nThe funny thing is that in this case, *avoiding* screens is what's being compared to unprotected sex.\n\nWhat a perfect summation of this phenomenon.\n\nMeditation is essentially raw-dogging taking green tea\n\nHow do you know those are the same people?\n\nthe old ways are boring. books and knowledge from the 60s era. but the kids today are more aware and most don‚Äôt know anything about the past written knowledge while still knowing enough about themselves to make conclusions as to what the nature of their reality is. now these people can frame the truth in their own words which spreads it even faster using the internet. it‚Äôs the mainstream that is now being ignored for just way too many ideas which makes it easier for the truth to come to light\n\nIt amazes me how people can take something simple and effective and turn it into something stupid.\n\nThis would have been considered common place a few decades ago. Maybe have a Walkman with a couple tapes. Maybe a Gameboy, book, or magazine. But most people just sat in silence.\n\nI still see a lot of people staring out the window. This doesn't seem that crazy or different.\n\nI grew up before tablets, cellphones, the Walkman, and movies in the back of the seats. People did anything to distract themselves: smoke, drink, talk, read. The wish to avoid direct experience was just as great back then, in a plane and elsewhere. The technology was just more primitive.\n\nJust think back to waiting around before the advent of smartphones - for a flight, in line for tickets, to be seated at a restaurant, whatever. Your options were to have a magazine, book, or newspaper with you, talk to the people nearest you, or just stare at whatever was in view. Smartphones now fills that in with quick hit entertainment. These days, what percentage of the tech-savvy population can withstand waiting without the urge to surf their phones?\n\nSometimes I resolve not to use social media for a day and watch how many times the urge comes up. I sat down in my back yard yesterday evening to play with my dog and for a moment I had the urge to go get my smartphone to have with me. Then ai realized that was ridiculous and just played with my dog. Needless to say, however, the conditioned urge was reliably there.\n\nI've sorta done the same with half-day media fasting. I usually create a to-do list to occupy that time - a list of house chores, list of errands, list of minor tasks, exercise, meal prep, meditate, read, maybe a power nap if needed (no long naps though).\n\nI don‚Äôt know, in the 90‚Äôs it would be super weird to just sit there, no books, walkman or anything.\n\n[There‚Äôs a whole Seinfeld episode about that](https://youtu.be/JBBQdFSvvTE?si=RxsP2wZz40GjPamu)\n\npuddy is a master raw dogger\n\nü§£ü§£ü§£\n\nWho turned what stupid?\n\nHey whatever works\n\nThat's the problem. Spacing out with a competitive motivation will not accomplish the same thing as proper meditation, in any tradition. It's not just what you do on the surface, but how you do it that matters. Don't get me wrong. many people may get into meditation with unhelpful mindset, but with good instructions, they can recognize an overcome them. I‚Äôm not sure that that‚Äôs carrying over here.\n\nMeditation doesn't mean sitting still for hours. If you're ruminating in your thoughts for 5 hours, that is not meditation.¬†\n\nBut I saw this video on YouTube‚Ä¶\n\nI much prefer the sound of a sharp 9 flat 13\n\nEspecially in a dominant context, #9 is a very powerful note. But I really like the ambiguity of the #11. And it‚Äôs certainly possible to have both: C^7#9#11b13.\n\nWell, depends. Thoughts arise, then they go away. Let that happen for a while they tend to stop arising so rapidly.\n\nHardcore rumination is something different, sure. Or loops. But we don't know that's happening.\n\nSo what‚Äôs meditation? You‚Äôre forced to be in your head if you‚Äôre sitting doing nothing.\n\nThoughts come and go and tend to stick together in a long chain, one leading to the other. This is rumination. Meditation is using a technique to break the chain of thoughts and to come into pure awareness in the present moment. Many techniques are available. IE breath awareness. You follow the breath in and out but eventually you will be sucked back into your thoughts. \"What will I have for dinner? Oh I remember this thing that happened, or oh I need to complete this task...\" Coming back to the main focus of your concentration, in this case your breath, is meditation.¬†\n\nYou can meditate while doing anything.\n\nMeditation is not an activity, but rather a state of mind, in my opinion.\n\nWhile it might seem like people who \"rawdog\" long flights are tricking themselves into meditating, it's not really the same thing. Meditation is a focused practice where you intentionally calm your mind and often use specific techniques, like breathing exercises or guided imagery, to reach a state of relaxation or heightened awareness.\n\n\nOn the other hand, being on a long flight without any entertainment can lead to boredom, which is quite different. Without distractions, your mind might wander, but it‚Äôs not the same as the mindful and deliberate practice of meditation. In meditation, you're actively trying to control your thoughts and focus your mind, whereas on a flight, your thoughts might be more random and uncontrolled.\n\n\nSo, while both involve spending time with your thoughts, meditation is a purposeful activity, while \"rawdogging\" a flight is more about dealing with a lack of stimuli.\n\nIt's still a concentration and mindfulness practice, just that instead of focusing on the breath or visualizing a flower one is unifying the attention around not giving in to inner cravings to engage in stimuli, and eventually through that equanimity arises.\n\nIf you are not using phone but instead using infinite thought loops in your mind, is it any better?\n\n\"Don't judge the thoughts that come, just see them come and let them go. You are on the shore, watching the boats, not sailing them.\"\n\n\nEven the most practiced meditator like the Lama at my Sangha has random thoughts while meditating. This is how he explained it to me.\n\nBeing completely lost in thought and abstinence cannot arise together. Infinite thought loops means mental agitaton, which feeds clinging and aversion to self and objects, which feeds craving for external stimuli because of our habitual tendencies of seeking comfort and avoiding discomfort.\n\nIf these people succesfully completed this task they cannot by definition have been completely lost in thought because they need awareness to identify when craving arises and reinforce the intention not to give in to it.\n\nBeing really mind identified and lost in thought would mean that 20 minutes in you would get identified with a variation of thought like \"this is stupid\", and just abandon the endeavor altogether and browse your phone or something, whereas if awareness is present you would see the thought and let it be. So yeah can totally be a practice as well\n\nRuminating or daydreaming is not the same as meditating.\n\nThey are not the same, but day dreaming is an interesting state of consciousness with its own qualities nonetheless. Tom Campbell has done some interesting work building on Robert Monroe‚Äôs work that uses day dreaming to achieve essentially what some consider to be out of body experiences (although Im not a fan of that term, it‚Äôs the popular term most understand). I won‚Äôt link to it because it‚Äôs a product they sell and I‚Äôm not trying to promote them, but it‚Äôs an interesting idea nonetheless that he claims essentially begins to collect outside streams of ‚Äòdata‚Äô.\n\nThis notion that there's rules, here, has bothered me a little.\n\nSeems to me any random person from the developed world who has made a conscious decision to *not* stare at a screen or listen to chatter on a long flight, or even read, has *definitely* made a mindful decision.\n\nAnd in that sense, per the OP, I don't even think they are tricking themselves into anything. They've made a choice, and are executing with an action.\n\nDid a bot write that?? Reads very botty\n\nI actually spent a lot of time thinking about it and rewrote it several times before finally settling on this. But now reading it back it sounds stilted and unfinished.¬†\n\n\nSo, I don't know if this is a compliment or not lol\n\nInteresting point!\n\nSmh these lames got nothing on me, I raw dog closing my eyes 6-8 hours A NIGHT üßòüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü•á\n\nThis reminds me of that episode of Parks &amp; Rec when Chris takes Ron to the meditation place and Ron says he didn‚Äôt meditate, he stood there for hours just breathing and not thinking any thoughts\n\nAnybody else thinking of Puddy in Seinfeld?\n\nI was sad that I couldn‚Äôt drop a gif of him on a flight here lol üòÇ\n\nI can do nothing and be fucking miserably overthinking at the same time. Especially if I‚Äôm traveling.\n\nHa! I didn‚Äôt know this was a thing. This is how I fly every single time. Granted I don‚Äôt fly a lot so it‚Äôs kind of novel to look out the window and just hang out.\n\nI thought this was something about sex on airplanes. It's simply zoning out on flights, or meditating. I've been doing this long before some tiktok'er became aware of such a simple thing to do; it's like they discovered fire and is calling it little hell or dancing lights.\n\nHa yeah! Note after living i  the UK for 3 years \"raw dogging\" on a plane sounds like a hilariously stupid thing to call it.\n\nI can tell you there are some very powerful techniques that help with travel sickness.\n\nMeh, Puddy was doing this back in the 90s\n\nThis is right up there with forest bathing\n\nYea, I'm double sided on this as on one hand you shouldn't force yourself to do anything you don't want to (like 14 straight hours of boredom on an overseas flight) but on the other it's nice to see people relishing in taking a break and experiencing \"nothing\" if they don't do that regularly\n\nI don't know how you can say any of these people are raw dogging when you can't tell if they are wearing a condom.\n\nYeah the name is super weird sounds like something sexual.\n\nIt IS something sexual\n\nThat's what got my attention... dogging has a totally different meaning üòÇ\n\n[deleted]\n\nYou know this how?\n\n&gt; \"on a video where he bragged about traveling on a seven-hour flight without headphones, sleep or other creature comforts.\"\n\n7-hours? If it were 7 days that would be something worth bragging about. There is enough going on during a 7-hour flight that you don't need \"sleep\", \"headphones\" or other \"creature comforts\". Who are these people???\n\nYou just toss off seven hour sits all the time? Damn. Start an ashram or something.\n\n&gt; You just toss off seven hour sits all the time?\n\n7 hours without \"sleep\", \"headphones\" or other \"creature comforts\" is not the same thing as a 7 hour meditation session.\n\nReminds me of this oldie banger of an Onion article: https://www.theonion.com/monk-gloats-over-yoga-championship-1819563855\n\nMan I‚Äôve been doing this for many years and now suddenly it‚Äôs a thing? Crazy\n\nlol youre totally right people are subconsciously glorifying meditation cuz it's what society needs lol\n\nThe writer watched Season 9 Episode 1 of Seinfeld, ‚ÄúThe Butter Shave‚Äù\n\nElaine and Puddy on the plane.\n\nElaine: I can't believe we broke up like that.\n\nElaine starts reading, Puddy stares off into space.\n\nElaine: Do you want something to read?\n\nPuddy: Nah.\n\nElaine: Well, are you going to take a nap or --\n\nPuddy: Nah.\n\nElaine: You're just going to sit there staring at the back of a seat?\n\nPuddy: Yeah.\n\nThis was me by accident on my 13 hour flight to Tokyo last week. I just sat there staring at the flight map for the entire flight, except for the meals. \nI can't fall asleep on airplanes and I forgot to download music on my phone for offline playing. I would not recommend not sleeping. But just zoning out for 13 hour actually wasn't to bad, I probably would have a worse time trying to entertain myself.\n\nI didn‚Äôt know that was a thing but I basically do deep breathing, watch the flight map and look out the window to see where we are, mainly because I don‚Äôt like flying and my heart starts pounding when we hit turbulence.\n\nI was on my lunch break at work in a cafe once, and my colleague walks in to check on me and says ‚Äúwait, you‚Äôre just eating?? Not even scrolling on your phone??‚Äù\n\nme, when i dissociate for the entire flight\n\nLet us ponder this assumption together with the following questions:  \n  \n**What is the nature of action in meditation compared to inaction?** Is the stillness of meditation merely a lack of movement, or is there a different kind of activity taking place within the mind  \n  \n**Can the intention behind an act change its nature?** If one person is sitting still with a deliberate focus on their breath and mental state, while another is simply sitting with a wandering mind, are they engaging in the same practice  \n  \n**What are the outcomes of doing nothing versus meditating?** How do the effects on one's mental and emotional state differ between passive inactivity and the purposeful practice of meditation\n\nBased on my personal reasoning of these Socratic questions, I would argue that the assumption is unjustified. Additionally, scientific evidence through brain scans have demonstrated significant differences between life-long meditating monks and non-meditators. \n\nWhat do you think? Can the intentional and structured nature of meditation be considered fundamentally distinct from simply doing nothing?\n\nI assume everyone doing this is taking a pic to say they did it, then going about their regular scheduled device usage right after.\n\nI used to do this on the school bus, we didn't call it anything back then\n\nTHIS!!!‚òùüèø\n\nGood point. I heard this on Wait Wait Don't Tell Me.\n\nIs staring into space meditation?\n\nNo.\n\nYou just realized that?\n\nBut is that good or bad and why?\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Gqee5DfAP9I?si=7ofHNM0fI6OpVEfq\n\nIs this not a normal thing? Last flight I took everyone on my row had the map going lol\n\nI do this, but with a soundbath or lofi in noise cancelling headphones ü§î Didn‚Äôt know it was so cutting edge\n\nI can easily disassociate in long flights, only to meditate for the last 20 mins lol\n\nNo one bugs me like that when meditating in churches\n\nI didn‚Äôt know this was what I was doing in the past 15 years of long-haul flights.\n\nShit I don‚Äôt even look at the flight map, turn the seat screen off and close your eyes\n\nThat's hilarious... Firstly, because they need to brag about something I used to do all the way through highschool... and secondly, because dogging also has a very different sexual meaning üòÇ\n\nI broke my phone one summer and didn‚Äôt fix it for 2 months, felt so great not wasting time and being early for everything just using a watch. I hope to get back to utilizing my time better, but I love TV too much:/\n\nI‚Äôm a flight attendant who works a lot! There are many people that stare into space! Shit, I stare blankly at nothing quite a bit sitting on my jump seat. Lol I wonder what my resting bitch face looks like?! Lolol\n\nBeen doing this since 1985. Welcome youngsters. Disconnect once and a while.\n\nWelcome to a journey of enlightenment! For decades, my core practice has been deeply rooted in what is now known as ‚Äòrawdog‚Äô meditation.\n\nAs a child, I was inspired by my great-great aunt who devoted hours to mindfulness meditation. Despite being physically limited due to a childhood disease, she found her solace and engagement in meditation. Her strong religious faith was intertwined with her practice of mindfulness. I remember her sitting on the porch, observing the sky, the trees, and the animals in perfect silence, a serene smile gracing her face. Even amidst the playful chaos of my childhood, I would find her in the same spot, still meditating on the world around her.\n\nMy great-great aunt was not only a meditator but also an intelligent conversationalist. Despite her limited formal education, she was largely self-taught in literary matters. My interactions with her sparked my interest in meditation as a path to happiness and serenity. This interest blossomed into a mindful meditative practice that I have cherished and developed over the past 60 years.\n\nSo, here‚Äôs my message to you: Don‚Äôt confine ‚Äòrawdog‚Äô meditation to air travel or similar situations. Embrace it anywhere and everywhere. Experience the benefits of knowing yourself and your surroundings without the need for special equipment, cues, or other aids. Try it while walking through the woods, strolling in a field, or simply ambling down the street. Free yourself from distractions and see the world and yourself as they truly are, not as you wish them to be. Enjoy the journey!\n\nWhy is this article categorizing these experiences into men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs? Am I not supposed to relate to the men‚Äôs descriptions only because I‚Äôm a woman?\n\nThis isn‚Äôt particularly new, either. Feel how you will about the character, but people like Joe Rogan talked about this many years ago. Travel is one of the few totally disconnected moments in many of our lives and a great time for deep meditation.\n\ni‚Äôve done this for years\n\nWhat about music? Do any of you listen to out on the flights?\n\nBroke therefore sober. That‚Äôs what they are.\n\nPeople that ‚Äúrawdog‚Äù want social media credit for it. It‚Äôs like the ice bucket challenge. They are experiencing some short term uncomfortableness for attention. Real rawdogging is a lifestyle, not an experience.\n\ni did it 13hs nonstop\n\nno food no bathroom\n\nI do this all the time. It‚Äôs a great time to use the extended block of time to really deepen whatever I‚Äôm working on. One time I was just focused on the jhanas. Another time I focused on observing all the sense bases where attachments and dependencies exist. It was profound. Very active despite being so still.\n\nI do this on every flight.  It's called being present, and not needing to be distracted away from what is.  Ridiculous if you ask me, for something so basic to now be a \"trend,\" as people become more and more scatterbrained.\n\n\"He was sitting right there with no phone or tablet or even a laptop. Just sitting and staring around like psychopath. Then he left. Yes. The world is not a safe place for us any more\"\n\nI want to understand your comment. Is it strange to see someone not fiddling with their tablet, or in some kind of frenetic mood? I don‚Äôt understand what you‚Äôre saying.\n\nOmg that‚Äôs what I do for no good reason. I feel overstimulated (maybe?) and just stare at the flight map and out the window. Zero entertainment. My record flight was from LAX-BNE. Nothing but my mind. \n\nI do this most flights. And I fly solo a lot.\n\nI meditate on flights. It‚Äôs a good use of time.\n\nAnyone else raw dogging their shits?\n\nThey care about likes and comments lol. The total opposite of why you should have been doing it\n\nThat‚Äôs a pretty generous assumption. I think it‚Äôs more mindlessness than mindfulness.\n\nI thought that a *controlled* environment was essential for meditation? You prepare the space, and as much as the ambient environment as possible; who ‚Äúraw dawgs‚Äù meditation and ‚Äúmeditates‚Äù in crowded/noisy/unpredictable environments?\n\nYou‚Äôll never catch me on a flight without my earbuds (last time, I dozed off on a 5 hour flight listening to ocean sounds, woke up because the guy next to me needed to use the restroom and I see a kid two rows ahead read in the face, screaming at the top of his little lungs and I had not heard any of it).\n\nThese people ‚Äúraw dawging‚Äù flights are nuts ü§£\n\nYou can meditate anywhere, any time.\n\nWhile this is true, it is not true that anything you do anywhere, at any time, is meditation.\n\nVERY true. üòé\n\nWhat a joke of a sub this is ü§£"

    "all_comment_text": "traditional practice of meditation was in the context of a teacher who possessed a body of inherited knowledge on how to navigate a life with meditation.  Now it seems that meditation is being practiced on its own and is completely detached from the body of wisdom and the context with which it is practiced within that wisdom.  I wonder if that has something to do with the negative effects of it.\n\nThis is it right here. Western practitioners strip meditation from the context it originates in and are surprised when they begin having experiences they can't contextualize. Someone once approached the Dalai Lama explaining all the difficulty their meditation practice was causing and the Lama asked them \"who told you to meditate?\". The question speaks for itself. Nevertheless, most people are coming to meditation uninformed seeking well being so it's important that we continue studying and supporting those who have negatively been affected by meditation and mindfulness practices. [Cheetah House](https://www.cheetahhouse.org/symptoms) is an organization that has been studying and supporting those who have been negatively impacted by meditation. I am not affiliated but it's certainly an interesting topic to explore for any serious meditator. Meditation ain't a joke nor is it something to be taken lightly.\n\nYeah the article reads ignorant to me as including depersonalization as a negative without discussing why this read as a red flag of ignorance to those who study Buddhist teachers. I think about what Hanh says on meditations on interconnectedness of all things. Without a healthy understanding of what that means, a western mind could get caught up on a negative and very common view of lack of self, and not understand the benefits and positives of the effect of depersonalization they are feeling in mediation. With a proper teaching and context that feeling of depersonalization mediation might make you feel more connected. It makes me smile honestly and makes me feel closer to God and my fellow humans. But, if you‚Äôre attracted to and enjoy the western idea of self, and aren‚Äôt interested in the interconnectedness of all beings in any true natural sense, then that process could be very depressing and dark for you to have to forced upon you.\n\nI‚Äôm really glad to see this comment. I also wondered relatedly if mindfulness increases awareness of depersonalisation/derealisation without actually increasing frequency. This has certainly been the case for me - I knew I was dissociating a lot because of PTSD but I wasn‚Äôt good at noticing when it happened or what it felt like. Mindfulness practice has improved my ability to tell when it‚Äôs happening but if it weren‚Äôt for my prior knowledge I could easily have assumed meditation was causing it.\n\nSeconding this\n\n\"Depersonalization\" is just a term that describes a set of symptoms - and those symptoms do appear as well in the Buddhist tradition as \"paggaha\" as an effect of practising with too much determination. \n\nI feel like we have an unhealthy tendency to look for all the differences between the antique East and the postmodern West when we could also ask ourselves, if there is not a lot of things we actually share.\n\ni think you lack substantial knowledge and experience on depresonalization writing something like this. \n\nit is more complicated topic. People often say that meditation is like dissociation but in a good way but it is not a complete truth. \n\nTo be able to discuss given topic one has to possess not only spiritual knowledge on the topics of meditation but also knowledge of the psychology. \n\nThe only good thing the meditation teacher can do for a person he sees is susceptible to neurosis and states of dp/dr is to advice him against meditating. Unless person does this psychological work the spiritual door supposed to be closed or it can become a very unplesant surprise. \n\nI believe that the idea of getting of \"ego\" and getting in touch with Self can be dangerous for both unprepared and psychologically/ emotionally underdeveloped. \n\n  \nI can with confidence say this both from my experience and from the theoretical knowledge on the given subjects, although I am more knowledgeable in psychology than spiritual practises.\n\nI went to Vipassana meditation, and they informed us about so many of these reactions that we might notice. How to try to deal with them, too. They also provided experienced teachers who gave personal answers to my questions and concerns in privacy every day! \n\nYou really shouldn't be doing this alone without personal guidance from someone who is experienced. But, Americans like to pick and choose what they want to follow, instead of understanding the system.\n\nYouTube counts as personal guidance right\n\nGood comment. I should have cited Cheetah House as it was one of the resources I saw that made me utilize help as I have done my practice.\n\nYou've articulated what I wanted to get at so much better! \n\nI do like (and usually benefit from) meditation, but I think that's because my first experiences were with someone who 1) prefaced the experience with context, 2) knew what they were doing, and 3) could safely guide us. I don't meditate often because it can be a lot, especially if I'm alone. I've also found 99% of the 'guided meditation' podcasts, etc. do make me uncomfortable... I am an anxious person and can see how one could get to a panic attack under poor conditions. \n\nDaily 'western mindfulness' for me nowadays is having lunch outside and people watching until I finish eating. It gives my brain something simple to do.\n\n[deleted]\n\nI feel many of us learn the hard way that we can't fight the thoughts. It's like wrong practice puts you through the washing machine with your thoughts and you continue to spiral and fight for long enough that acceptance becomes a possibility. It's as if it arises naturally through practice.\n\nHow can one be sure they have the right teacher?\n\n[deleted]\n\nYes. Last I checked, Eckhart Tolle is worth $75 million, and most of his ideas are based on pseudoscience.......he has some good aspects in his teachings, but personally, I do not like following some teachers who claim to have achieved absolute Enlightenment in some form or another.........there is a dark side to Buddhist meditation, even in the East where it is common to have uncompassionate beliefs about children who are born with a physical or otherwise disability, as a product of a bad past life and their current reincarnation is punishment for some supposed misdeeds..........it is a form of Caste System........\n\nSociety has changed dramatically since the origin of many of these teachings. Without the correct cultural underpinnings, many things can never be contextualized properly. You need new teachers who have reached a proper understanding and can speak to a modern audience. Also, I would argue that modern life is simply not conducive to mental well-being (cue the famous Krishnamurti quote.) It may be that a mix of mindfulness and mental breakdowns is as good as it gets for many people in circumstances not conducive to enlightenment. The path is made by walking it, there has never been a guarantee of success.\n\nKrishnamurti:\n\n*We take pleasure in ambition, in competition, in acquiring knowledge or power, or position, prestige, status. And that pursuit of pleasure as ambition, competition, greed, envy, status, domination, power is respectable.*\n\n*It is no measure of health to be well adjusted to a profoundly sick society*.\n\nmodern society is not at all conducive to mental wellness.\n\nPeople are ‚Äúmeditating‚Äù without actually being given the tools and technologies from a qualified teacher.\n\nIts a long, slow process of development. Just because a person sits with their eyes closed does not mean they are meditating, and however a person manages to disturb himself when sitting with his eyes closed does not reflect at all on the merit of actual meditation.\n\nPeople refuse any type of mentor.  Not for bad reasons, but still I don‚Äôt believe one can do everything without a teacher.\n\nIt takes longer without a teacher for sure, but who taught the teacher?\n\n\"Who taught the teacher\" is a very important question in traditional meditation systems.\n\nEven the Buddha himself learned meditation from other Hindu masters, so the lineage of teachers in these traditions goes back thousands of years. \n\nThis way you get teachers who are both thoroughly vetted as well as thoroughly trained.\n\nHmmm, so if a person closes their eyes, doesn‚Äôt go to sleep, and is aware during this time, does this fit your definition of meditating? Because that would account for most people that close their eyes and try to meditate\n\nThe only other thing I would include is an effort to focus on the present. Thoughts will still happen of course, but maintaining focus on the moment can distance you from those thoughts a bit and help cultivate more awareness. This can be done through watching the breath, body scans, mantras, or just taking in everything you can feel in the moment.\n\nIf I sit down and daydream, lost in my thoughts the whole time, I wouldn't really consider it meditating.\n\nMaybe not meditation, but what is wrong with closing your eyes and daydreaming? I mean in modern life, even infants and toddlers get little to no time to day dream. Daydreaming is a great respite from the \"alway-on\" lives we live. \n\nSo, while it may not fit the idea of meditation, I would say it is beneficial as well.\n\n Nothing wrong with it at all! I daydream often for entertainment and relaxation. I was just describing how I see it as different from meditating. I often daydream at work when things are feeling especially monotonous. Gotta watch out for harmful daydreaming though, I've had maladaptive daydreaming issues for a while that meditation really helps me with\n\nGood clarification\n\nMost people engaging in \"meditation\" are like hens sitting on unfertilized eggs. They're not really doing anything productive. They could sit there for 1000 years and no spiritual fruit would come from it. The only thing they might be doing is familiarizing their mind with dullness, which is actually counter productive. Hence, why seeking out qualified instructors is so important.\n\nThis definitely is a big issue, but also, certain techniques and practices are not suitable for certain, either in the present moment or in general without several accommodations.\n\nGood point. And sangha (community) the most important part of practice, which is mostly impossible online\n\nThat's an interesting take, because (during and) since the pandemic I have deepened my own study of Buddhism and found a great deal of community support online. I have a weekly online sangha that I really treasure. For those who live in more remote areas or in places where there aren't a lot of other Buddhists, online study, retreat, and sangha may be the only option.\n\nWhere did you find it brother?\n\nI replied to another comment on this, but in case you can't see it, I love the online communities at Dharma Moon and Insight Meditation Society.\n\nI did not... thank you.\n\nCould you share those sources with me as well, if you still have them?\n\nI wrote some long answer on similar lines. People who have been preaching, teaching, selling meditation are just riding the wave to make money.\n\nAlso the meaning meditation has been long lost since the day they made up word in English for the sake of translation from Sanskrit to English.\n\nIdk how to put that answer here, but if someone is interested then scroll down in my comments.\n\nI'm not sure having a highly religious leader with no real medical background was necessarily the best at spotting or treating symptoms of mental health side effects. It's nice to think of the cool traditional bodies of wisdom, but don't forget these were often very religious people with strange beliefs.\n\ndon't get hung up on the \"religious leader\" aspect. the point is they are usually someone with decades of experience examining their mind, who has done so with their teacher who also had decades of experience examining theirs with their teacher, and so forth. when you sit with your mind, and you don't have anyone with experience doing the same to help to guide you through misunderstandings and difficulties, things can get very hairy. it's like trying to learn martial arts by yourself without the guide of an experienced teacher. whether that teacher believes in chi or prana or other realms or whatever isn't the most important aspect of that relationship.\n\nI like your approach of this with skepticism¬†\nTrue, not all religions are good at this, but Buddhism is better at it than the others.¬†\nPsychology in its current state is not advanced enough to have you put that much confidence in it,( if possible look into the replication crisis in psychology, look at how research is often done, it's not a hard science like physics or chemistry or biology), Though I believe it will reach a advanced position one day.\nBuddhism has put much time and resources into the study of the mind, this has obviously yielded results.\nCalling them \"Highly religious\" as if that makes their morals and practices inherently barbaric/primitive reduces their arguments into religious blabber.\nBuddhism often uses an approach towards the mind that reminds one of scientific temperament and logic, and the results it yields are of good quality.\n\nMeditation or not. Contemplation of oneself eventually leads to mental break downs and/or dark night of the soul experiences. Enter into a method of psychological help from a counselor or psychiatrist. Watch what happens when you acknowledge what‚Äôs locked within your mind. It‚Äôll be the experience meditators get to when contemplating or concentrating practice is done. \n\nOne cannot set out to view one‚Äôs inner workings of their mind and expect to have a great experience all of the time. It‚Äôs unrealistic and not possible. These people who have had these experiences while meditating are all pointing to something by that all people experience when trying to seek something larger than your own experience up onto the present moment. \n\nMeditation, therapy, etc put you into a dualistic front row seat of very much viewing your own shit and many people do not like what they find. They cannot take it. This is why it is fundamental to eventually find a meditation teacher and/or therapist to help guide you because you will undoubtedly break down eventually. It happens to everyone seeking to step out of the usual day to day.\n\nI agree with a lot of this. \n\nOne issue to keep in mind, though, is that everyone is going to have different thresholds for how much they are able to handle in any one sitting. People who have years of repressed traumas and dissociation because they lived in unsafe environments growing up or experienced circumstances that they never got to process are not aware that their subconscious was keeping all of those tabs open. During meditation, all of that can flood out without warning, and for someone who has a highly dysregulated nervous system, that's not optimal nor healthy.\n\nIn addition to that, a lot of people have underlying conditions that make certain practices and techniques incompatible with their current constitution.\n\nas a therapist who uses mindfulness regularly, I'm really enjoying your comment. We are taught in trauma modalities to become very sensitive to someone's \"window of tolerance\" to understand the risks of flooding. I often \"ramp someone up\" to \"real mindfulness\" by using slow, grounded mindfulness practices. Such as 2 minutes of counting meditation which includes out loud feedback. Clients are invited to be paradoxically \"in control\" of their practice in a meta way and open their eyes, move, etc, if they feel like it. I think that one area that could be researched is if the person has certain beliefs around what meditation is supposed to be, that these beliefs can really hinder practice, as obviously addressed quite frequently by buddhist teachers. Clients who I know live with stuff related to ADHD, trauma, dissociation, depression, anxiety... they get custom-tailored mindfulness practices to ensure this flooding does not occur, or occurs in a very safe and controlled environment at the very least.\n\nYeah, I experienced the backlash of this first hand when I was doing meditation coaching training a few years back. Two of my pro-bono clients, older female and younger male in his late 20's, had severely repressed traumas and contemplative practices where they brought attention to different aspects of their life that they wanted to improve highly triggered them as we delved deeper in the second session. It was a very unpleasant experience each time because it was not something that I knew how to navigate back then as they both just got furious at me, one immediately asked me never to initiate contact again. And they were friends of mine from different circles that I valued a lot. They had not disclosed that they were experiencing distress until after their respective sessions, and they both already meditated on their own and/or practiced yoga asanas hardcore. Both of them were seeing therapists, so yeah, it sucked to be blindsided by all of that, lol. Although I have done trainings in more trauma-informed practices since, I am always wary about who I guide in meditation now. \n\nThey did have somewhat rigid beliefs surrounding what meditation is and how it's supposed to go, but yeah, it was then that I realized that not everyone is ready for meditation. And I was guiding body scans, heart breaths, grounding visualizations, intention-setting, simple affirmations, and breath awareness. During the sessions, the coaching dialogue seemed productive based on their initial feedback, but I guess not, lol.\n\nI kind of hate guiding live meditation classes because of those types of experiences. Since I don't get feedback in real time, I can't really improve my guidance and end up adversely impacting someone who wasn't ready for the meditation I was going to guide. Another instance was when I was guiding a local grief support meditation group, and people stopped showing for the last two sessions. I didn't find out until months after that it was because I said Shavasana is translated to English as corpse pose when I was guiding yoga nidra. The volunteer coordinator had spoken with the social worker who was following up on the attendees, and apparently, that led to the person to spiral about their own mortality for weeks.\n\nYou are not responsible for the feelings of others.\n\nI am not, but I am responsible for carefully vetting who I engage with during live meditation sessions.\n\nWell said. One could from meditation for example recall past trauma, and then outside of meditation obsessively ruminate about their recognition of how they have been reacting to it over the years. However by then the meditation itself should have taught them that was merely the machinations of their ego which had wrong, but good intentioned plans to \"protect\" them.\n\nYou are 100% correct. It ‚Äúfollows‚Äù you off the cushion so to speak. One horrible thing the West has done is convince People to approach meditation as a relaxation tool. My gosh that is so bad to do that. No one expects to sit in relaxation and then remember how their dad used to beat them as a child. But that‚Äôs what happens when you drop out of your usual day to day push pull of the five senses. Your mind will still keep trying to make meaning as you concentrate so it‚Äôll do with those thoughts that arise as it pleases to. \n\nBefore I got really serious with my practice as a meditator I did not have Buddhism in my life as part of that practice. I saw a therapist biweekly who would guide me through my thoughts that were seeming to press harder and harder as my sitting practice developed. That was two years ago. I couldn‚Äôt have gotten through without my therapist. I am writing transparently in order to help people avoid these pitfalls. Meditation will help you see that these things, the trauma you carry, the horrors, they are mere passing thoughts arising and passing. But, you still have to eventually acknowledge them all and most of us do not have the wherewithal to do that. Seek guidance, people. No shame in it at all. Don‚Äôt ‚Äúpush through‚Äù to a psychotic breaking point lol. \n\nMy inbox is always open for meditation talk and Dhamma. Happy sitting everyone. May you be happy and free of suffering.\n\nBut it‚Äôs precisely because you are relaxed that your ego feels safe enough to relive that trauma. Relaxing your body is making you more resourced to be able to confront experiences that might be unsettling. Being relaxed and sitting and breathing through these types of experiences bring the understanding of impermanence of these negative experiences and allow us to work through them and heal from them. Emotions often just want to be witnessed.\n\nI like that: Emotions often just want to be witnessed.\n\nYup, I'm in the West and was once guilty of using meditation to \"relax\" often right at the end of a stressful workday. My thoughts would slow, and my body would relax, but I would note that I still had a sort of melancholic anxiety feeling. I was expecting it to go away, but it couldn't and wouldn't because I would ruminate about why, and what the feeling meant, and etc. I should have just noted the feeling, and sat with it without judgement or inner discourse.\n\nWhat you just wrote was kind to yourself, friend. Acknowledgement of where the thought came from, is kindness. You sat with the anxiety feeling and that is also kindness. Open awareness as it is.\n\nThis is what I am working on too. I try to feel my feelings without judgement until they pass these days. I used to hold on to them and ruminate for days but studying zen literature has helped me overcome some of those reflexive anxiety responses to my negative feelings and I am generally happier now. The right perspective is key.\n\n&gt; My gosh that is so bad to do that.\n\nNot universally, I find that doing ten to fifteen minutes breathing and reflection a day has dramatically changed my life for the better. I'm not looking to fracture and rebuild my soul.\n\nI have been practicing medication for over forty years, and with the exception of going off the rails through doing two hour long TM sits in my twenties, once I began to practice in a buddhist context my meditation practice improved greatly and has led, since then, to a general settling of my mind and a growing positivity. I practise daily and chose my meditation technique based on what I feel my body and mind need at that moment. Although, In essence, meditation can be thought of as the toothbrush of the mind (a simple daily practice to maintain mental clarity ), if developed further it has a much greater potential, but the advanced states which can be experienced, such only be attempted with the full support guidance of an experienced teacher.\n\nThis somewhat happened to me. I started using guided meditation in late 2019 on an app and in the silent moments I ended up thinking about the most traumatic times in my life and since I lived alone and worked from home I became more isolated and was just thinking about it constantly. I was already under extreme stress and thought mindful practice would help but I didn't feel safe. Everything was heightened and I didn't recognize myself and I spiraled. I continued to practice until 2022 when I left my work from home job and got one at a work site. I knew it was not good for me to be alone all the time. This year I understand a lot more about myself have a therapist¬† I trust and do qiqong and stay physically active. I don't spend all my time alone. I have had a breakdown this year but having support has been extremely helpful. I now see how I judged myself and want to give love and compassion for how truly broken and lonely I felt at those times. I am grateful for the experience I'm truly learning to love myself unconditionally for the first time.¬†\n\nYou may not have read the article. It's not saying that meditation is inherently bad - it's saying that the \"wellness coaches\" are not explaining the effects and the point/path of it at all. Yes they call it 'side effects' in the article and that's just bad wording, but the thing is, yes you will reach down to your shadow, but they're giving you a tool like it's a toy, and not a sharp knife.\n\nSome philosophies call this existential angst. Ever had that sudden awakening experience of an intense fear of the unknown at night? It's similar but sometimes these mind-body practices can amplify these bad experiences for the subject because they're not properly at the level to handle them on their own -- they don't know how to shift their self-consciousness in a way that accepts this intense energy and allow it to flow through their own way of Being here.\n\nSome spiritual traditions call this a spontaneous Kundalini awakening experience.\n\nI didn‚Äôt read it but I‚Äôve read other articles, books, and heard podcasts all referencing the things that can happen while meditating and I am here to say it is all normal. You eventually need almost always need guidance both professionally and spiritually as a meditator.\n\nClassic\n\nYour (currently top) comment in this thread doesn't match what the article is talking about. You said:\n\n&gt; Meditation, therapy, etc put you into a dualistic front row seat of very much viewing your own shit and many people do not like what they find. They cannot take it. This is why it is fundamental to eventually find a meditation teacher and/or therapist to help guide you because you will undoubtedly break down eventually. It happens to everyone seeking to step out of the usual day to day.\n\nMaybe I'm misunderstanding, but it sounds like you're saying 100% of meditators \"break down\" and require help from outside to work through that.\n\nThe articles says:\n\n&gt; A 2022 study, using a sample of 953 people in the US who meditated regularly, showed that over 10 percent of participants experienced adverse effects which had a significant negative impact on their everyday life and lasted for at least one month.\n\nThe article doesn't elaborate, but to contextualize, \"significant negative impact\"s in studies looking at the negative effects of meditation include everything from \"poor sleep\" to \"buzzy feeling in the body\" to \"mental breakdown\".\n\nI think research into meditation's negative effects is important and like the article mentions, it's good to warn people about potential negative consequences ahead of time. \n\nBut it's also important not to overstate the prevalence of negative effects.\n\nWhich is why a lot of people, myself included, are against this complete secularization of the practice devoid of the spiritual traditions in which it has been developed and practiced for millennia. Every tradition that uses meditation for achieving enlightenment talks about how to navigate the pitfalls that are common for someone engaging in this practice. And some of the more advanced meditation practices absolutely are considered secret because you need a spiritual guide in order to do them properly, otherwise you can lose your sanity. The push to secularize it and remove meditation from that context comes at a cost of relearning some hard fought and earned lessons that took hundreds and hundreds of years of teachers and students talking about the trials and tribulations of this practice.\n\nYeah it took many many many \"lessons\" to learn to accept the thoughts and stop running from the pain. The thinking just happens and is natural for mind. No need to put up resistance against a part of the whole. :) It's like you experience enough pain that another option eventually arises by just acceptance of it.\n\nI don't know a ton about meditation so I'm kinda confused about the \"viewing your own shit\" contemplation part because I thought meditating was all about thinking as little as possible. This sounds like actively thinking to me. Can you elaborate for a noob?\n\n[deleted]\n\nI was very pleased to read your insight and accurate reply to OP‚Äôs post. Thanks\n\nThis was well put. I appreciate this!\n\nI am grateful that this subreddit is not an echo chamber. The fact of the matter is that duality is a fundamental principle of life at play and that good and bad must both exist so that more good can come out of it. When you think about it, meditation is really not much different from psychodelics where you can have both good trips and bad trips unexpectedly.\n\nCould you enlighten me on what a dark night of the soul means and how does it come to be?\n\n&gt; It happens to everyone seeking to step out of the usual day to day.\n\nThis is a really strong claim. Do you have anything to back it up? E.g. a research paper or something from a well-known meditation teacher.\n\nThe fact that this subreddit seems to be upvoting someone who says everyone who meditates has a mental breakdown and needs a therapist is bizarre to me. I kind of think there‚Äôs something about the nature of reddit and Redditors where out of a combination of laziness and feigned victimhood absolutely everything has to be made into some kind of oppressive force.\n\nDon‚Äôt agree with this. It‚Äôs based on a very western dark night of the soul idea of obsessive self analysis and mental breakdown - which has nothing to do with meditation practice - if done correctly, in fact it‚Äôs rather the opposite.\n\nI have an unusual perspective on this. I developed derealization after a 2 year psychedelic sprint. That was built on top of a 10 year mindfulness practice.\n\nWas the mental break down from my own shit bubbling up? Or was my new shit the product of a sudden switch in mental circuitry?\n\nI‚Äôd argue the ladder. I‚Äôve had to greatly reduce my mindfulness practice in response to this event, and completely stop my use of psychedelics. Based on my study and my experience, the deep states of consciousness available through psychedelics are a bit like jet-fueled meditation. If someone became a devoted meditator in search of the depths through long sessions, I believe that a similar experience of derealization could arise.\n\nTo put a fine point in it: this wasn‚Äôt the shit of my life coming into focus - it was an entirely new realm of problem. The piece that has stuck with me most prominently has been a fear or anxiety around suicide and intrusive thoughts. From the derealization came a concept that this life is ephemeral in a way that reflects the truth of it, but goes further and says, ‚Äúyou could end it and it wouldn‚Äôt matter.‚Äù So I‚Äôve become very paranoid around high places from which I could fling myself off. There are stories of people who derealized on psychedelics to the point of suicide. One English woman in the aftermath of an ayahuasca  ceremony went on a walk with her father in good spirits and threw herself off of a cliff very unexpectedly. (Jennifer Spencer https://almahealingcenter.com/ayahuasca/ayahuasca-deaths/) (here‚Äôs the source of the walk with father anecdote: terrible site unfortunately https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/woman-29-took-life-after-23373050?int_source=amp_continue_reading&amp;int_medium=amp&amp;int_campaign=continue_reading_button#amp-readmore-target)\n\nThis is the kind of mental illness I‚Äôd expect to arise in OP‚Äôs study. The more you pull at the string of psychedelic trauma the more obvious it becomes that there‚Äôs a dark side of the mind that arises from detachment from your perceptions.\n\nThe thing that sustains my life today is the opportunity to give and receive love, with Jesus as my savior. It‚Äôs a crazy world. üíõ\n\nProbably better to link to actual research, rather than sciencealert ‚Äì it just aggregates and sometimes sensationalizes.\n\nHere's a bibliography from the site of a widely cited US academic who specializes in bad outcomes stemming from meditation. Lots of info there:\n\nhttps://www.cheetahhouse.org/bibliography\n\nThank you!\n\nEven this list is quite meaningless. There‚Äôs literally hundreds of meditation studies being done every single year.\n\nWhat does it mean when a handful every year show meditation can have possibly have negative effects? And 200 others do not?\n\nThere‚Äôs also many many ways studies can be wrong, false or completely useless if you know anything about the topic.\n\nThe only way to make any sense of it at all is do a deep dive into every study with the proper scientific background to actually determine if the results are valuable/accurate.\n\n&gt;What does it mean when a handful every year show meditation can have possibly have negative effects? And 200 others do not?\n\nIt means that in a small percentage of people, meditation can have harmful side effects and that should be taken seriously. If a study showed that 5 in 1000 people experienced harmful side effects from a new medication would you dismiss that as \"meaningless\"?\n\nMeditation is clearly a positive and powerful force in many lives, and nobody is denying that. But that doesn't automatically mean it's good for *everyone*, and to summarily dismiss evidence of possible negative effects is not reasonable behavior.\n\nI think the important takeaway from this is 'bigger picture' - we are encouraged to meditate all the time, with no thought or mention of potential side effects. These studies are evidence that meditation may be harmful to some people. This is good to be aware of before trying meditation. Similar idea behind prescription/ OTC meds - there are warnings and potential side effects on each bottle. If you experience any of them, you're advised to stop and talk to a medical professional.\n\n&gt; Even this list is quite meaningless. \n\nDo you have a link you would consider authoritative?\n\nFind a study that claims to be a ‚Äúsystematic review‚Äù. Those are not authoritative per se but they will look at all of the available research and study it. Much better than just one paper.\n\nThanks, but this isn't my question.\n\n\n\nI'm asking for the parent to provide a better source than the bibliography I linked to. It's curated by a team led by one of the most widely cited researchers looking at the negative effects of meditation.\n\nOh, this is very nice! A couple of the studies cited in OPs link do seem legit, but I had to do some sleuthing to make judgment calls on journal reputation, etc. (I'm an academic scientist, but not in psychology). It is important to have resources like sciencealert or scientific american - I certainly have trouble reading journal articles outside of my field - but yeah, bias and sentationalization are a big problem.\n\nHi. I used to meditate a lot and read fairly widely at the time. This post popped up in my feed so i thought i would reply. Hopefully I'm not wading into controversy by replying!\n\nAre we taking about \"dark night of the soul\" type experiences? That might be why the \"keep meditating\" advice comes up. But that said, historically, meditation was done with a \"sangha\", a community of others, including experienced monks, who were on hand if you struggled. Western meditation on the other hand tends to be a solitary pursuit. Some branches of meditation consider sangha as a pre-requisite to even beginning meditation.\n\nThere was a book whose title i won't mention as it was controversial at the time, but it warned in very strong terms to \"stay out\" of the dark night of the soul, something his tradition of meditation saw as a natural step on the path to enlightenment. Guys advice was to really have your life in order before entering it, but also stated that you can end up in it without intending to. But yes, it was described essentially as a mental breakdown to be meditated through.\n\nThis may be different to what's being discussed here however\n\nYes -- it's more than that.   You need a  relatively healthy mind to meditate, just like you need a healthy body for vigorous exercise.  \n\nFor example, many people have deep and buried subconscious issues that can come up in meditation, so they need to work on those issues before starting a meditation practice.\n\nI know he's a somewhat controversial figure, but Dr. K reviews negative aspects of meditation from a research and spiritual perspective [here. ](https://www.youtube.com/live/ErfG8bmK_Pk?si=MQTNGmMyPEu52HEz&amp;t=984)\n\nBasic things that I remember from the stream are:\n\nMeditation &gt; 40 minutes, or done with very high frequency increases (multiple sessions throughout the day) the risks of negative outcomes.\n\nAscetic practices increase the risk of negative outcomes (sleep deprivation, fasting, etc).\n\nSome intense qigong or other meditative practices increase the risk of adverse outcomes.\n\nMost negative outcomes are temporary, and can vary from depersonalization to low mood, but some cases are more \"permanent\" anxiety, PTSD, dissociation disorders, etc.\n\nI didn't know he was controversial. Personally I've learned so much from him, it has been a godsend to have free access to such teachings.\n\nMainly lunatics from /r/ADHD\n\nYeah, whats controversial about him?\n\nApproaches like this are like saying \"exercising for more than 40 minutes is dangerous because it can cause negative outcomes\".\n\nYou need to have a healthy and strong body for vigorous exercise, and you need to exercise correctly.   That's why athletes have trainers and coaches -- so they can exercise intensely without getting hurt.\n\nTeachers and gurus in India are the 'trainers and coaches' for spiritual athletes, and they prescribe advanced practices for their students who are ready for them and can benefit.\n\nMany meditators in the West are driven to meditate because they suffer from mental illness that is not being helped by Western medicine.    \n\nIf these mentally ill meditators take up advanced practices without being guided by a teacher, that's not a wise idea. \n\nIf a person tries to lift too-heavy weights without correct form, then they are likely to get hurt, but not because 'exercising in a gym is dangerous'.\n\nJust blaming the practices without teaching about correct context to me seems like useless fear-mongering.\n\nWatch the video. What he‚Äôs saying is similar, the comment above didn‚Äôt include the reason why these can be dangerous.\n\nSorry, but I really get annoyed with folks who dibble/dabble in \n\nsomething and then publish these dark contributions about \n\nthe terrible contraindications. \n\nYes.....working with your consciousness is like working \n\nwith anything such as body-building, diet, hobbies, etc etc. \n\nYou need to use a centrist and informed approach....which is \n\nwhy it used to be that a person found a teacher or guide. \n\nI remember a guy who thought it was a good idea to fast, \n\nand decided out of the blue to fast for 30 days because\n\n\"that's what Jesus did\". Wound up in the hospital because he \n\nassumed that \"fasting\" included not taking his medications. \n\nI swear....you can't make this s**t up !!!!\n\nYes. I see lots of posts like: ‚ÄúI started meditating last week and I‚Äôm going to a 10 day retreat next week. What should I expect?‚Äù IMO, people like this are asking for trouble.\n\nAn article that outlines causes it claims to be from specifically mindfulness meditation, without laying out how mindfulness is the cause, then it bounces to criticising the capitalistic mindfulness industry, which has nothing to do with how meditation has a ‚Äúdark side‚Äù (at least neurologically). \n\nIt‚Äôs like saying therapy causes mental health issues when someone realises that they have unhealthy behaviour patterns. Definitely worth investigating negative neurological effects, but this is a bit flimsy.\n\nThere is suffering in life and it needs to be understood. 1. Nobel Truth\n\nMeditation does not *cause* side effects or syndromes; it uncovers them. Those who have the courage to examine objectively and plow through will find healing. It's as serious as you want to make it.\n\nThose who don't, will find reason to blame anything but themselves for their own problems.\n\nIt's like saying \"cleaning the house caused a festering corpse to appear in the corner.\" It wasn't the cleaning that caused the corpse, we just never looked.\n\nThis has been my experience, but the article specifically states that people without any mental issues can develop them with meditation.  I'm inclined to believe those mental issues were already there but I'm not sure how the study handled that and I'm not a scientist.\n\nAnyway, I had the dirty closet thought yesterday after meditation and thought it was like finally opening that door and taking stock of the mess lol. And I'm at a place where I can handle that right now, which is probably why a meditation practice seems to finally be 'sticking'.  We'll see how it goes.  :)\n\nIt's quite interesting how they would know they would not have developed those things during their lifetime without meditation... It would be impossible to know.¬†\n\nI mean, when I‚Äôm telling people about options for trauma healing, I almost always say it‚Äôll get worse before it gets better. Sometimes people don‚Äôt have symptoms because they‚Äôve been in survival mode so long, but they still are so disassociated they often aren‚Äôt present for the joy in their own life either. When they are sufficiently safe it‚Äôs time to rip the coping mechanisms off and resolve the trauma they‚Äôve been avoiding. Yeah, doing this will make them a mess for a bit. I also tell people it‚Äôs like, ok you have to go in and get pins in your legs. Of course now your leg temporarily has less mobility. But now it‚Äôs healing, and before you were just coping. Healing pain is different from coping pain. Like if you were having a messed up leg and you were taking ibuprofen every day, that feels like it sucks less than right after the surgery when you are recovering. But ultimately the person will feel better than they did before the surgery. Healing takes time. Healing the mind, same as the body.\n\nStrong disagree. There is an element of truth in what you are saying but meditation can both cause illness and aggravate existing conditions. Meditation teachers offer cautions and guidelines for a reason\n\n[deleted]\n\nThis is from the article: \"Mindfulness is a type of Buddhist-based meditation in which you focus on being aware of what you're sensing, thinking, and feeling in the present moment.\"\n\nIsn't mindfulness a form of stillness in the present moment without focus on thoughts and feelings? Even if there is awareness of them, no importance is given to them. It's not focus on them. \n\nThe article draws conclusions from a false premise.\n\nThat sentence is just the author's summary of meditation. But nothing in the article rests on the precision of that definition, as the evidence in the article comes from other sources, which have no relationship to that precise definition.\n\nYou would have a point, *if* the author somehow specifically looked only at meditation studies that used that precise definition of meditation, and excluded others, which they did not do.\n\nBingo! :)\n\nI don't think that one sentence discredits everything else.\n\nWhy wouldn't it? True science comes from study of a hypothesis, but if the hypothesis is obviously false, then no true scientific conclusions can arise.\n\nYou're most likely reading too much into one sentence. It's not like the article gave that precise instruction and studied the outcome. Rather, it's summarizing research and quoting people from a variety of studies and instructions.\n\nthey‚Äôre not ‚Äúside effects‚Äù üôÑ you are uncovering the very heavy weight of existence. fears you didn‚Äôt know you had and attachments that hurt to be broken. but that is the price of your freedom, to be with love.\n\nWhat's with all the posts here that says meditation is bad? It's not bad... you might've been misled into thinking it would give you something that you didn't get. But that doesn't make it bad...\n\nexactly. *\\*\\*meditation makes someone realize they're deeply insecure and scared\\*\\* c*onclusion: Meditation is bad!\n\nAfter reading that I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs about as biased as all the avid meditators that this post is going to upset üòÇ\n\nAvid meditators are some of the least upset people you'll encounter in this world.\n\nI‚Äôm upset you‚Äôd even suggest that üßòüò°\n\nWell now I'm embarrassed, clock üò≥ üïí\n\nMy covers blown üèÉ\n\nWell I am MORE upset than you\n\nThis isn‚Äôt a competition; but if it was I‚Äôm pissed offüò§üò°ü´É\n\nWhy should anyone be upset? Meditators know more than anyone else that our minds are complex beasts. The metaphor of training an elephant is an ancient one.\n\nYou are not guaranteed to befriend the elephant and ride victorious on its back - it may just well trample you.\n\nThat is why there is not just one meditative path for everyone. Be mindful and try a different way to befriend the elephant if your current approach is aggravating it.\n\nYou can't tame the mind. The lesson might be to accept it for what it is and don't live your life trying to control thinking. When you don't mind the mind it doesn't become a problem for you freeing up energy that was otherwise used to put up a wall against thinking. Once you can stop running from the pain it stops controlling you as much. It is a never ending process but that is ok as this is the life we live! :)\n\nAgain the problem is most of us get lost in the experience when rather it's about the awareness behind the experience. Kind of in a way like a mirror reflecting back on itself. \n\nWe create the good and bad in our lives!\n\nTo me it just seems it makes you aware of what's already there. So if you were already having a bad time, meditation makes you more aware of it so you can take steps to change your life.\n\n‚ÄúThe only way out is through‚Äù\n\nI would go so far that to say that negative side effects are (at least to some degree) predictable even since they are a well documented part of the journey. In that context I consider them to be typical and generally belong to different stages of the journey.\n\nPersonally, these experiences have probably halted my progression with a few years to be honest. Today I am way more comfortable with being uncomfortable or even terrified at times. I know - by experience- it is temporary even though it may last for a long time.\n\nI don‚Äôt believe anyone can walk this path without any adverse effects at some point. I simply don‚Äôt see how you could not feel at least slightly concerned when the perceived reality is about to break down.\n\nThat‚Äôs called meditation sickness I believe and it comes from western influences of control and fear based thought \n\n\nI think that people say ‚Äúit will go away‚Äù becuase from their perception, over time they have let go of the implicit fear and need for control that so many of us are conditioned to have\n\nAtleast in my own experience; recognizing and letting go of this fear is what has enabled me to get the most that I can out of life, even though I still feel stuck and there isn‚Äôt much I can do to change that stuck feeling/ reality. I am however able to unstick my thoughts and still have fun and work within the confines that I have to change what I can \n\nHope this helps atleast explain why I think those perceptions exist and why what you‚Äôre saying is totally a valid critique and has a time and place to be spoken about \n\nI feel it necessary to encourage everyone to pay attention to how and why people share information, where their coming from and that the implicit bias might be and how it relates to fear, control, and letting go/ learning to appreciate the things we‚Äôre never going to be able to change, even within ourselves and especially within others, and the system as a whole!!\n\nSimilarly don‚Äôt take psychedelics if you aren‚Äôt comfortable facing things in your own mind. It doesn‚Äôt get talked about because it is brought up before you even start with deep introspection\n\nThe article says 10% of meditators might experience  a number of listed negative psychological symptoms.\n\nMeanwhile a whopping [19.1% of the general population of the US experience anxiety disorders each year.](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/any-anxiety-disorder)\n\nAnd meanwhile, the world as a whole, ruled and run by non-meditators, is in the process of destroying itself, with genocides and environmental destruction rampant.\n\nI just don't see meditation being the problem.\n\nAnyhow, these studies typically don't control for the practice of generosity and virtue as a prerequisite for success in meditation. That's a major flaw.\n\nEver heard of Dark night of the soul?\n\nMeditation is such a misunderstood term nowadays with hundred if not thousands of different practices.  If one does not work, particularly causing adverse effects, so and try another.  If you use a meditation plier to drive in a depression nail, it just won't work. \n\nAlso, meditation should not be the single tool for mental health.  There should be a variety of practices under proper supervision including meditation.  Maybe getting more sleep, no electronics 2 hours before sleeping, going to sleep earlier,  etc.\nSelf curing by watching YouTube videos and social media sites may not give the best results.\n\nMeditation isn‚Äôt for everyone. And I‚Äôm one of those people. Meditation does not work for me. I do, however, find myself in a meditative state when I‚Äôm taking a walk-through a local park and see the greenery and animals in their natural environment. I take deep breaths during that time and can clear my mind. Meditation doesn‚Äôt have to be something that you sit down and focus on. It‚Äôs whatever makes you feel relaxed. That could be sitting on your porch with a cup of tea in the morning. Anything like that.\n\nAlso, the reason I think this article isn‚Äôt a big deal is because meditation is not forced upon anybody. We all have the choice to not meditate. So if you or somebody is experiencing negative side effects for meditation, just stop. It‚Äôs that simple. Find something else to do.\n\nThe complexity or problem I have that meditation is bad or negative results is that meditation is actually a very broad term yet people treat it as something specific.\n\nMy general feeling that basic concentration meditation is extremely safe, and likelihood of negative results is very low.  Here you are working on increasing your concentration muscles and ability to focus.\n\nMindfulness training is similar, but is an area of more unknown as it can lead to insights that can cause some scariness‚Ä¶ depending on the type of training.\n\nHowever l, insight meditation, body scanning, and several others get into many dangerous areas that without proper training/teacher can have devastating consequences.  Mental breakdowns can be a regular occurrence and moving towards this path hitting one of these breakpoints without progression can leave you in a dark state that is very difficult to get out of.\n\n&gt;My general feeling that basic concentration meditation is extremely safe, and likelihood of negative results is very low.\n\nYes. I suspect that many people who develop psychological problems are doing intense vipassana (insight meditation) without having prepared the ground, so to speak, by quieting the mind before beginning. I agree that the dangers of meditation can be a real problem, but I wish the article had gone into more detail about the type and intensity of practices that had a higher rate of producing difficulties, as well as examining the correlation between those with pre-existing psychological pathology and those who encountered difficulties.\n\nYall starting to notice how often these articles get posted? Like is it any more clearer now?\n\nIt‚Äôs at least once a week one of these lame ‚Äúdark side of meditation‚Äù articles get posted with bunk science. The podcasters repeat, and the Redditors scare away from something that is fine for the vast majority of people.\n\nCorrelation does not equal causation.\n\nFor these negative effects I.e. psychosis/extreme anxiety/etc there are many times a predisposition or underlying trauma. (Meaning it‚Äôs not the meditation causing it, gasp!)\n\nI'm finding a lot of anti-meditation threads popping up lately and it seems extremely conspicuous. I fear the bots may have found their latest target in trying to stop folks from opening up their minds. Don't fall for these threads or heavily opinionated articles. \n\nMeditation is an amazing practice and certainly a key part of the human experience. All love.\n\nMeditation mixed with spirituality saved me. I guess everyone is different. I get super grateful and happy after meditation. But I also practice spirituality where I speak with my guides.\n\n\\&gt;I know this forum is very anti-meditating-is-bad so this will probably get down voted but I wanted to share it since there are others present seeing the same symptoms.\n\nwhoda thunk that the meditation subreddit would be anti anti-meditation ü§£ still glad you shared though.\n\nI definitely agree that telling people to meditate when they are having a psychologically unstable experience is very wrong advice. I imagine the reason people say this is because they are likening it to continuing to meditate despite it being difficult or painful -- which is VERY different than, say, experiencing psychosis or delusions.\n\nThis article is misinformation.\n\n&gt;Since mindfulness is something you can practice at home for free, it often sounds like the perfect tonic for stress and mental health issues.\n\nThis is the first line... just use your imagination to continue this paragraph and tell me what the author wants you to believe. It's biased. Probably written by a Church group to get you to pay a pastor every week instead of discovering spirituality for, FREEEEE (spooky)\n\nReading these comments, I expected to see many accounts of ‚Äúthis horrible thing happened to me while meditating‚Äù but I see none of that. Is it possible that most people who have these negative experiences had a superficial encounter with a technique not appropriate for them?\n\nA lot of people blame western culture for trying to distill meditation down to a tool that makes you better.  This is not an exclusively western problem! I sat for a ten day retreat with the Goenka school Vipassana. If ever there was a school that turned meditation into a narrow tool that is it! Incredibly simplified one size fits all approach.\n\nIn contrast my very western teacher Tara Brach teaches a variety of techniques, in the context of psychology, and I have never heard of negative effects - probably because, like with medicine, using the wrong thing makes you worse?\n\nThe space meditation creates allows whatever hasn‚Äôt been processed to bubble to the surface. If you‚Äôve done a great job of suppressing something for a long time yes, meditation will make you have a bad time. Didn‚Äôt need a scientific study to know that. The only way out is through.\n\nSometimes mindfulness seems to help with my PTSD symptoms but it's nowhere near enough on it's own. Psyche meds and weight training five days a week has finally got me some peace.\n\nThis is good to know. I dated a guy that said he had negative results from meditation. That was my first time hearing about such a thing. I believed him. Not everything is for everyone.\n\nThis is just like everything now. Just meditate for heavens sake\n\nThank you for sharing that. I think that‚Äôs important to know, especially for people who have suffered trauma or already disassociate.\n\n[deleted]\n\nActual psychosis can make people suicidal, violent, etc. So saying to just embrace/face it is not good advice. You can't cure severe mental illness with meditation and/or new age practices.\n\nI generally have noticed that meditation without the proper spiritual guidance often comes with this sort of take.  That's why I highly recommend that people explore Buddhism or some other spirituality rooted in meditation techniques.  The road through the darkness can be complex and relentless.  Without the proper help of others to navigate these tests, an opportunity for transcendance and deep healing can turn into an even great trauma itself.\n\nIt‚Äôs kind of strange that I‚Äôve never heard anything about this before!. I‚Äôve been meditating for 46 years. Studied meditation extensively, and haven‚Äôt talked to anyone that had bad experiences that lasted for more than one session or two.\n\nAs someone who has presented DP yeah I think meditation had a role in it but that's what spirituality is about, letting all your garbage come out. The question is if you're willing to do it for the better. That makes meditation bad? meh depends who you ask.   \n  \nAnd you could also say \"an article was just published about how people that chase money have more chances to become depressed\"... like yeah?\n\nI think there's a lot of people who are not prepared to look inwards and when they do, they have to deal with the facts of what they uncover about themselves. \n\nWithout the context of using meditation alongside self work via therapy or whatever other techniques, you're opening yourself up to potential pain.\n\nPretty sure this is a genetic defect. Every major religion tells you to meditate, most doctors tell you to meditate. It‚Äôs also quite possible your meditating incorrectly. You shouldn‚Äôt be focussing on anything you need to empty your mind. There‚Äôs literally no harm that can be done from this. What this article is explicitly talking about is mindfulness meditation, where these people focus on the present moment and if your present moment is horrible obviously if you put all your emotional and spiritual energy into a horrible moment, it‚Äôs gonna keep reflecting that that‚Äôs why you empty your mind when you meditate.\n\nI have always found, these specific people, are using it as an escape. Its not meant to escape. Just my two cents, been meditating for a handful of years now ¬†\n\nWhen wondering why a person does what they do, follow the money. This author has a book out and a private practice. Meditation and mindfulness has the potential of putting therapist that have long term patients out of business. Plus nothing sells more books than inflamatory topics like \"Meditation might be killing you!!\"\n\nI can understand how meditation can have negative effects for some people.  When meditating you open yourself up to what is around you.  If you are surrounded by negative force, a door has been opened to let them in.  That is why it is important to surround yourself with love and have a positive state of mind.  Love is an armour to negative forces.\n\nNo no, this is wrong understanding. Yes, love is very important, true love is imbued with compassion, joy and equanimity. Please know mindfulness meditation is a tiny part of a whole Buddhist worldview. When one strips it out of that context and mix it up with whatever comes, we are liable to misunderstandings and crazy unsought for experiences.\n\nHi friend, were you practicing within a Buddhist scope? did you have a teacher? what was your intention and goal through it? Also, I‚Äôd recommend you to check out a book called McMindfulness. We live in a fast paced world with easy-grab solutions, the meditation practices we now encounter all too easily are bound to generate unwished for results.\n\nMeditation as a goal to get better is missing the whole point. It isn't about the experience but rather the awareness behind it. Any striving and trying to get anywhere other than what is happening will just create more tension. Awareness allows everything to arise and that includes the shadow self that has been likely suppressed. I felt like I was going crazy for a few years before a switch really flipped and habits changed. Daily life is work but when I sit in stillness I can just be with whatever arises and gives a feeling of acceptance when back to living! :) It's too easy to be tricked by mind. The goal shouldn't be to get rid of ego but rather just be aware of it. That in and of itself is acceptance. Daily life without ego isn't possible. It isn't an enemy but rather just an appearance in consciousness.\n\nmy experience is meditation sometimes brings up bad stuff that's already inside, and you get to reflect on them\n\nafter that, you get to act with a clear mind and pure intentions, no, a persisting problem will not vanish with meditation unless you act on it, i think that is kinda common sense\n\nWhat is happening is you‚Äôre coming in contact with yourself and your shadow. It has to happen at some point but yeah I can say if anyone has a history of trauma that it‚Äôs probably ideal to be extremely cautious\n\nI heard a podcast in which they said that meditation itself will not fix your problems, but it shines a 'light' to parts of your mind that were either kept in the dark or things in life you had not paid attention to. And sometimes these things could be long term habits that are causing trouble in your life or the psychological effects of a traumatic experience that you have neglected. It can put your squarely in front of your fears, so that could also cause some pressure if you're not ready to face them. And this also depends on the type of meditation you perform. Some forms of meditation can take you deeper than others.\n\nI‚Äôve no idea why people in the west think mindfulness is meditation or the only way to meditate. I understand it‚Äôs supposed to be based on a certain kind of Buddhist practice (Sati) but it strikes me as the opposite of other mediation practice which is more like no mind. \n\nI‚Äôm not convinced that the western interpretation of sati - which is translated as mindfulness but also means conscious attention or bare attention - is accurate. It‚Äôs possible to be aware, conscious and grounded in the present moment  without having thoughts about it. \n\nI tried a bit of western mindfulness to see what it felt like - too many thoughts is the answer. Which is probably why westerners like it.\n\nMy experience of meditation is that it massively eases anxiety rather than causes it -  it‚Äôs my go to for anxiety where everything else has failed. It also eases depression and lifts my mood making me feel more peaceful and content.\n\n\n\nMindfulness - I don‚Äôt see the point of it at all.\n\nYou just had a bad teacher. You don‚Äôt explore the inner workings of your mind to meditate for anxiety or trauma. You literally have to reprogram your parasympathetic nervous system and that means *not* focusing on your mind but on your breath instead.\n\nIf you don‚Äôt like closing your eyes, don‚Äôt close your eyes. If you don‚Äôt like counting the breath, don‚Äôt count your breath.\n\nThe main neurological point is that you need to be calmly exhaling for longer than you inhale. If you do this, and you are a mammal your nervous system will start to calm down.\n\nI have to disagree with this take on meditation. While I‚Äôm sorry to hear about your experience, it's important to be clear: meditation is overwhelmingly supported by scientific evidence as a powerful tool for improving mental health. Yes, challenges can arise, but those are the exception, not the rule.\n\nCountless studies have proven that meditation reduces anxiety, stress, and even symptoms of depression. Research from Harvard has shown that regular meditation can actually change brain structure, increasing gray matter in areas related to learning, memory, and emotional regulation. That‚Äôs not just a small benefit ‚Äî it‚Äôs a profound shift in how the brain operates.\n\nThe idea that people are just told to ‚Äúkeep meditating and it will go away‚Äù is a misunderstanding of how responsible mindfulness practices work. Qualified instructors are trained to help people navigate difficulties, and nobody should be pushing through distress without support or adjustment.\n\nLet‚Äôs also not ignore the fact that meditation has been practiced for thousands of years, benefiting millions of people across cultures. The notion that its negative side effects aren‚Äôt reported is simply misleading. When done properly and with guidance, meditation remains one of the most effective, evidence-backed tools for mental well-being.\n\nWhile individual experiences may vary, the science clearly shows that for most people, the benefits of meditation far outweigh the occasional discomfort. If someone‚Äôs struggling, it‚Äôs about finding the right practice or getting proper guidance, not abandoning one of the most well-researched methods of mental health improvement.\n\nI would be curious to see a comparative study to see how many people have 'adverse side effects' from practicing any other of a range of life choices. Like for example choosing to study psychology, or philosophy. How many people have had serious mental breakdowns upon pondering the meaning of life from the great philosophers and realizing that life has no objective meaning, purpose etc. Their life has been a \"lie\" etc. Any number of practices and events can bring on a dark knight of the soul. \n\nIt seems a risk to just living. Indeed I'd say that a mid life criss is the same thing for many and a useful life journey to go through, if uncomfortable.\n\nAmen. More people need to know about this and teachers need to be honest &amp; informed.\n\nI have to agree with some points here.  However I don‚Äôt believe the meditation caused the anxiety or depression.  It uncovered it.  As to psychosis yes that‚Äôs a possibility in people already genetically inclined.  A good teacher will be a guide including steering those who are not right for this practice away from it.  In addition there are as many different types of meditation as there are drugs.  In my country we have early intervention psychosis teams who deal with those people who have been made psychotic by using cannabis.  It‚Äôs quite common and permanent.  I don‚Äôt see any early intervention centres for meditators.  Vispassna centres make you sign a waiver re not having any mental health issues before you start.   I myself have had a brief psychotic issue not from meditation but stress.  I agree the possible issues should be talked about more.  But that‚Äôs no reason to throw the baby out either the bath water.\n\nThanks for sharing! Years ago, when I started meditating (6hrs a day for 4 weeks) I'd have pretty vivid pseudo-hallucinations. They absolutely terrified me, I stopped meditating and visited doctor after doctor but they were all like \"not much we can do except prescribing neuroleptics\".\n\nIt eventually got better after about a year and now I've been meditating again for five years or so.\n\nThere‚Äôs a really interesting podcast on this called Untold: The Retreat\n\nThe very first sentence of this article reeks of ignorance.\n\n&gt;Since mindfulness is something you can practice at home for free, it often sounds like the perfect tonic for stress and mental health issues.\n\nMeditation and mindfulness isn't a \"cure\" for stress and mental health issues caused by living in the modern world. Meditation shines a light on and makes you more aware of the things that cause these issues. If you're unwilling to let go of the things that cause your stress and mental health issues, OF COURSE meditation isn't going to help and will make it worse because it takes away your unhealthy coping strategies for living a life out of tune with yourself.\n\nMeditation is simply deep thinking... so you can't stomach being in your own head? Now you hope other people will validate this and confess that they are just as weak so you won't feel like something needs to be fixed? Gotta love Reddit\n\nAnything in moderation\n\nI have heard that meditation will always make the practicing person at one point to be insane thats where the guru guides and sorts you into the proper capacity to manage the internal conflicts and chaos\n\nThis is an interesting article. I think it points to the need to have opportunities to meet directly with an experienced meditation guide regularly. But even more importantly, much advice about \"meditation\" can bog down in certain practices and behaviors that just get folded into whatever dysfunctional patterns a person already has. And many people who \"teach\" meditation may not have the skill or sensitivity to offer useful suggestions to people who are running into trouble. I would doubt that just sitting still for a while causes mental problems but it might bring out problems that are already in us. Most of us are living with a huge burden of unfinished business and dysfunctional patterns. Working with this requires a lot of sensitivity. - Jay Cutts, Rain Tree - NM Center for Meditative Inquiry and Retreat. [https://meditationnm.wordpress.com](https://meditationnm.wordpress.com)\n\nI have been practicing hard core meditation for over 30 years. Negative effects are a sign that your practice is working. True meditation causes a catharsis of all past karmas.  If you are successful in your practice you will experience disastrous consequences which will feel almost death like. Not only psychologically but also in all your life situations. Of course the true goal of meditation is total emancipation which happens much later. My Master said that the awakening of Kundalini, which is the evolutionary energy, is equivalent to total disaster. But in the end one will be totally emancipated from all suffering of any kind, enlightenment.\n\nThe only negative thing I have discovered about meditation is the highly negative, stress ridden people, that attempt it. After trying everything in their little arsenal, they proclaim our ancient art as  BS and not really worth it. \n                         We require a minimum amount of deep awareness to even begin meditation, and most of humanity don't have that tiny amount yet. After a hundred more  lifetimes, of stress ,betrayal, and suffering, they will be finally ready to join our little club.\n\nThe anti-meditation meditation club\n\nThis is so interesting. I feel like if you have no mental illness background/ dealing with the full spectrum of your emotions or experience with psychedelics, ego death and just general existential experiences prior to refining them with meditation, you would probably experience all those things through meditation. They are quite unavoidable when travelling deep in the depths of your psyche. I feel like the article is all levels of convoluted and totally missing the point.\n\nA worldly person living in these times, having a family and responsibilities, having personal dreams and then doing meditation, what do you think will happen?\n\nArticle doesn‚Äôt go deeply. It just touches at high level.\nIn Tamil there were 18 siddhars who talk in great depth about the side effects of doing meditation wrongly without the proper guidance of a Guru. \nMeditation is a powerful technique to absorb the energy from this universe. To withstand the energy, our body should be equipped properly. That is why siddhar like Pathanjali have told about the eight steps in ashtanga yoga. It‚Äôs a lengthy time taking process. But people don‚Äôt have time. We are in fast food world. We need immediate results which lead to dangerous experiences.\n\nFascinating bit of research that I will post when I find, but traveling and I want to get this down before I forget üòÇ it found that people who meditated with the sole purpose of getting the results of meditation tended to be the ones that got the least out of it. While this definitely can tie back into the cultural connections to meditation, it doesn't have to per se. Changing the focus from results orientaiom to a more meditating for the sake of meditating,  for growth seems key\n\nI think if you‚Äôre not addressing the negative things that are coming up then they will continue to appear. This is why having someone to talk to helps because then as those things come up you can release, and begin the healing process\n\nI think meditation as a practice of sitting is narrow. There are so many ways to meditate and some help some people better than other methods.\n\nBut on to adverse effects‚Ä¶being more in touch with spirituality is not always pleasant. And I do not think it‚Äôs (usually) psychosis. Learning to understand that is important.\n\nIf you pick up a power tool and start randomly juggling it while it‚Äôs turned on, you‚Äôll probably end up in the hospital too.¬†\n\nWith meditation if you do it wrongly, you might just end up in the hospital too.¬†\n\nIn both cases, proper instructions and correct practice will make you far, far less likely to injure yourself.¬†\n\nTLDR - meditation is not dangerous in itself, but the wrong practice/practicing wrongly, or already damaged minds, can cause bad outcomes.¬†\n\nA colleague of mine went to Bengaluru India for a meditation retreat. She came back psychologically damaged. She Spilled water on her boss intentionally, she complimented another person on the buttons of his shirt, and other examples of her mentally fragile state. \nWhen she started to see a psychiatrist/psychologist, she talked to me about her experience in the retreat. She said she was walking backwards in a pattern of 8.\nIn the book \"Eat, pray, love\" there is a paragraph about the protagonist being told that she can't do a retreat if she has internal problems. My colleague clearly struggled from internal conflict all the time, her parents were divorced and her mother married another person and had the second child with him. She had lots of clearing to do before going on such a big journey. \nHer example is always a reminder for me that when you're not balanced from within, meditation can mess your mental health if taken to extreme levels.\n\nInteresting.. I follow a YouTuber that did a \"deep dive\" on the negative/bad affects and spirits yoga lets in .. I wonder if there's any similarities.\n\nI merely skimmed the article so not participating in the conversation fully but a thought I‚Äôve had around this issue is that practices like mindfulness, which all animals engage in, are not aligned with current social and economic demands and can therefore throw the anxiety, depression and delusion that underpin current social and economic systems into sharp relief.\nThere is also this other article published, referring to ScienceAlert‚Äôs penchant for shock as a tool to increase readership.\n\nWhile meditation generally has positive effects, there can be some potential negative effects, especially for those new to the practice or those dealing with specific mental health conditions. Here are a few possible downsides:\n\n1. **Emotional Distress**: Meditation can sometimes bring unresolved emotions, traumas, or repressed memories to the surface. This emotional release can feel overwhelming, especially without proper guidance or support.\n2. **Dissociation or Depersonalization**: Some individuals report feeling detached from themselves or their surroundings after extended periods of meditation, which may feel unsettling.\n3. **Anxiety or Restlessness**: For some, focusing on inner thoughts and sensations can actually heighten anxiety or lead to feelings of restlessness, particularly in those prone to anxious thoughts or who are new to meditation.\n4. **Physical Discomfort**: Sitting for long periods can cause physical strain, particularly in the back, neck, and knees, if done without the right posture or support.\n5. **Self-criticism**: Beginners sometimes struggle with self-judgment if they feel they‚Äôre ‚Äúnot doing it right.‚Äù This can turn meditation into a stressor instead of a relief.\n6. **Sense of Isolation**: People who meditate intensively might start feeling disconnected from social environments, which could lead to a sense of loneliness or alienation.\n\nPracticing under guidance, especially when beginning and going at a comfortable pace, can help manage these potential effects.\n\nMany of you arent even meditating properly as well as dabbling with diffrent types of meditation when you dont know what your doing because you dont get enough of a \"kick\" out of standard meditation.  you guys also confuse each other with all this word rhetoric and philosophy which has nothing to do with meditation which is very simple. your trying to be too fancy about it\n\nThis sample size is too small. \n\nThe benefits out weight the cons \n\n2. You didn‚Äôt even input what was bad about it .\n\nWhat are negative results from meditation?   \nWhat's good and bad in this context? :)\n\nMeditation is not just about ‚Äúescapism‚Äù. We must unify our action - with INTENTION. Meditate using your intention and a visualization as a focus for yourself. Be kind to yourself. Be gentle. Why are you doing this?\n\nPretty much every tradition acknowledges negative effects stemming from meditation. Any form of Buddhism, the Hesychasm of Eastern Orthodoxy, the contemplative tradition of Catholicism, the various Yogic practices of Hinduism, and so on.\n\nThat's why the traditions don't generally recommend going down that road without a guide, usually a learned practitioner, to help you along the path.\n\nlike axiomatic sparkle fuel cake political door rain chop ruthless\n\n *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev/home)*\n\nMeditation without wisdom, concentration and ethical foundations is misguided.\n\nNegative results would mean not actually meditating. People quit because they‚Äôre either not doing it enough or not doing it properly. It‚Äôs like saying I quit fishing because I didn‚Äôt catch any fish, but never used a rod or bait.\n\nYes!! üôå\n\nI agree 100% that 'just keep meditating' is lousy blanket advice. BUT, they mention the roots of meditation being in Buddhism but fail to mention a key Buddhist concept, skillful means. This is the idea that we all have different mental dispositions and need meditations and teachings that fit those dispositions. Meditation (and associated teachings) will never hurt someone, and will always help, but they need to be appropriate to the individual.\n\nAs a person who has been meditating for 5 years, I completely agree that there *is* a *danger* both in the meditation itself, done perfectly correctly, but without knowledge of the processes that allow you to work with traumas that will (and should) definitely come up during meditation, and also in the danger of doing some silly techniques (after listening to people who don't know, even in this community I constantly hear some silly and harmful advice).\n\nHere is a resource. When considering the question of whether meditation is dangerous, you first have to define danger. Is something \"dangerous\" is it sometimes causes discomfort and fails to be 100% pleasant? Then yeah, meditation fits that description, as does literally everything we experience in life.\n\n\"Trauma Sensitive Mindfulness &amp; Plum Village practice (40 Years Retreat #4)\" from the Plum Village app. \n\nhttps://link.plumvillage.app/uMrP\n\nit‚Äôs 100% possible to meditate wrong and to fuck yourself up from it. if you go any deeper than basic relaxation/mindfulness then a teacher is highly recommended.¬†"

    "title": "Update after 1600 days of meditation, how it changed my whole perspective on life",
    "body": "Hey Reddit! Remember me? Two years ago, I shared my experience of meditating daily for 1000 days. The response was overwhelming, and many of you reached out with questions, support, and your own stories which helped me a lot in feeling supported. I am (an you are) not alone. \n\nI've now reached 1600 consecutive days of meditation. That's over four years of sitting with myself every single day, through good times and bad. It hasn't always been easy, and it certainly hasn't been a linear path to enlightenment (spoiler alert: I'm definitely not enlightened!). But it has been transformative in ways I never expected.\n\nWhen I started this journey, I was looking for peace, maybe a bit of stress relief. What I found instead was a  tool for self-discovery, resilience, and growth. Today, I want to share some of the most impactful insights I've gained along the way. \n\nBut before we dive in, I want to emphasize something crucial: while meditation has been incredibly beneficial for me, it's not a substitute for professional help. If you're dealing with severe anxiety, depression, trauma, or any other mental health challenges, I strongly encourage you to couple meditation with support from a qualified mental health professional. They can provide targeted strategies and support that complement your meditation practice.\n\nNow, let's explore how 1600 days of meditation has changed my perspective on suffering, life, and myself...\n\n1. Facing Suffering: At first, meditation made me more aware of my suffering, which was incredibly challenging. I got frustrated thinking what a scam meditation was. But as I persisted, I gained insights into the causes of my suffering. Once cause become clear, I started hating on the cause, wether it was me or an external person or event. Again, I persisted, which led to acceptance which led to synchronicities - meeting people and discovering resources that offered new perspectives on overcoming suffering. Once I know why I suffer, and stop blaming it on the why, I start moving on effortlessly. The effort I found is to  be displayed to persist on sitting with my broken slef day after day. \n2. Understanding Attachments: I realized most of my suffering stemmed from attachments - particularly to family expectations and societal definitions of success (status and money).\n3. The Power of Focus: I learned that meditation's core is about focus. \"Focus on a single point and wait for grace.\" This improved my ability to read, contemplate complex questions until solutions formed in my mind, and choose positivity when facing darkness by (forcing) my mind to look the other way, the glass half full. \n4. Sensing Life Differently: I now instinctively perceive the causes behind events and sense a spiritual guidance shaping my path. This awareness helps me understand the direction I'm being nudged towards. I still don't fully understand this invisible hand pushing me through life but I am certain of it's existance and it's guidance. Suffering appears to be one of its tools. It helped me overcome an eating desorder, a severe depression, an inability to keep a partner and many minor struggles. All happened when I accepted to face my suffering until I see its cause, then stop blaming the cause and reframing my mind to think about things differently. \n\nImportant Note: I'm not claiming to be a \"liberated soul\" above suffering. I still struggle a lot and fall often. The difference is that I'm no longer attached to these experiences. It's like watching a video game character - I feel momentary sadness at setbacks but quickly reframe them as learning opportunities for the next \"level\" and I start the level all over again. It's a game with no gameover.\n\nMisconceptions: Initially, I believed meditation was about breath focus, visualizations, hugging trees or other superficial practices. While these can be tools, I've found the essence is simpler and more profound. It's all about learning to focus to be able to understand then to reframe. \n\nAdvice for Those Suffering: Be present with your pain. Close your eyes and sit with your suffering until you become comfortable with it. Notice how it feels in your body. Once you stop resisting, insights about its causes often emerge naturally. With this understanding, you can address the root issues - often mental habits or perspectives about yourself and the world.\n\nRemember, meditation isn't about escaping suffering, but about developing a new relationship with it. \n\nPlease be free to share any different perspectives on the subject to enrich my point of view.   \nKeep in mind I am not a professionnal nor a student of any particular school of thought even though I am interested in all of them and study them very seriously for fun and with the goal of overcoming my own suffering.

    "all_comment_text": "I can close Reddit now for this is the most nutritious information I shall digest all day.\n\nThank you for sharing. \n\nContinued best wishes in your journey. üôè‚úå\n\nMade me laugh ! Thank you üôè\n\nI loved the pragmatic, relatable way you have framed your experiences. I had a question in mind, if you might share some insight. \n\nThere is some kind of energy within me that does not want me to meditate, or to improve myself. This force is what manifests as procrastination, lack of discipline etc. I feel like this force is always working against me, disrupting my momentum, stopping me from improving. \n\nDid you encounter this kind of an energy? What is it? How did you overcome it?\n\nThanks you for sharing. You've put a finger on the strongest force against the end of suffering my friend. Some call it evil. I'd rather see it from the hermetic principles point of view. The Principle of Polarity.\nThe Kybalion says: \"Everything is dual; everything has poles; everything has its pair of opposites; like and unlike are the same; opposites are identical in nature but different in degree; extremes meet; all truths are but half-truths; all paradoxes may be reconciled.\"\nNow what that means in my opinion is that when you start to move a force for good (meditation to reduce suffering), wether you want it or not at the same time you awaken the opposite polarity of that force which is trying to keep you from moving forward. The struggle between the two forces creates balance. \nNow what you should do about it, is to see it as the weights at the gym or water when you swim. It's resistance. It's not bad. It's training you and it's goal is balance. Some days you'll beat it, some day's it'll knock you down. Assess what happened when you fail, how exactly it got you, and go at it again the next day\n\nThis is some really deep insight, thank you! You know, I think I have developed a subtle fear of this polarity, like I want to self sabotage doing something good becase its opposite force will also build. So it is best to not do anything.\n\nI think that when in the Gita Krishna talks about \"performing karma without expecting the fruits of karma\" or \"the middle way\" or the idea of flowing along with what is, of the idea of detachment...these might be ways to achieve the balance that you speak of. What do you think? How do you protect yourself against the opposite polarity?\n\nWu wei or gita's teachings or hermetic laws and even the bible they all are trying to say the same thing in a different way. Peace is in balance. Balance is achieved through hell going loose and you staying erect and moving forward. \nWe are our worst enemy because we have the tendency to refrain from open the door of spiritual growth cause it comes with opposite forces. That's the mistake every sage has tried to warn us about. \nWhat I would do (and actually did) is to reframe it. I don't try to protect myself from it if I don't see it as a bad thing. It just is. You can't build a house without digging holes and breaking some rocks. \nWhen the opposite polarity is at play, i just notice that it is and literally tell myself \"let's see who wins this time\". \nIf I lose, I try not to blame myself and just move forward. If I win, I don't get cocky but grateful for the help I got from the universe or whatever that helped me. we can not win all the time. We only need to win 50.1% of the time.\n\nLovely thoughts. You are articulating some things I only intuited and speculated at. This conversation has been very reaffirming :)\n\nGlad I could help ! Don't take this whole journey seriously. It's better to see it as a game with no winner but a lot of growth. There is no end to this game. Cheers friend\n\nI will keep that in mind :)\n\nThank you for your thorough and insightful post and this response in particular. I very much like your tie in with hermetic philosophy - I never thought about the push of this force as an opposite reaction within a pole but it makes so much sense. \nI‚Äôm motivated to get back into meditation now and see what I can‚Äôt unlock for myself. Thank you!\n\nGlad it helped my friend :)\n\nAs our inner light grows. The darkness seeks to surround us. We see this in Christ's temptation and crucifixion. His light was shining üåü, so a great evil tested him to see if he was worthy to wield it. Same with the story of Job. Christ mentions this too in the story of the man with the unclean spirit. He cleans it then dirty spirits of darkness, sin and craving descend on him, seven times as many. Which illustrates the pattern of cleansing and then more dirt being piling on top of us at higher levels of suffering as we climb up Jacobs ladder. Which makes sense as a cycle of enlightenment. The darkness üåë being a core aspect and component to determine coming to the light.¬†\n\n\nBlessed are those who are persecuted for my name. Jump for joy and rejoice. For yours is the Kingdom of Heaven. üåü\n\nThanks üôè this touched my soul . Bless you\n\nI see everything you all are going through ¬†and I have a YouTube video that may be beneficial and help out. Let me know if you want the link.\n\nI get this. Except in my case, I very much want to meditate it just never seems to happen. Or, when it does, I am never consistent with it. \n\nI am moving to a new place on a beautiful rural property this week (it will take a few days to drive there with my dog), and reading this post makes me want to start meditating regularly. I truly believe in meditation. \n\nOp, do you do it yourself or use guided meditations? Do you have a particular spot, time, and length of meditation that you stick to to keep your (absolutely amazing!) consistency going?\n\nI am truthfully in awe of you right now, op. I started making \"daily\" videos for my YouTube vlogging channel 922 days ago. Except, unlike you, I have unfortunately messed a few (less than a dozen) days in between due to different circumstances. \n\n\n1600 days of meditating every day is so cool and beneficial. I am very grateful for seeing and reading this post. This is synchronises appearing in my life ‚ô°\n\nDon't worry. Sounds you are on the right move. And the best, you have a dog!!!\n\nMy dog, Boss, is the absolute best!\n\nI too try and meditate every day, I get so much peace from it and enjoy it but I do find that I need to apply it to my everyday activities also. So even the days that I don't sit in meditation I don't give myself a hard time because that in itself is nit being mindful. Goo luck with your journey, it is such an interesting one to know thyself.\n\n&gt; When you are not in a hurry and the mind is free from anxieties, it becomes quiet and in the silence something may be heard which is ordinarily too fine and subtle for perception. The mind must be open and quiet to see. You need not worry about your worries. Just be. Do not try to be quiet; do not make \"being quiet\" into a task to be performed. Don't be restless about \"being quiet\", miserable about \"being happy\". Just be aware that you are, and remain aware. Don't say \"Yes, I am. What next?\" There is no \"next\" in \"I am\". It is a timeless state.\n\n&gt; When you sit quiet and watch yourself, all kinds of things may come to the surface. Do nothing about them, don't react to them; as they have come so will they go, by themselves. All that matters is mindfulness, total awareness of oneself, or rather of one's mind. \n\n- Nisargadatta Maharaj (I am That)\n\nThank you so much for this!\n\nYou are very welcome. There are some other meditation pointers from NM that might be helpful [HERE](https://www.nonduality.com/asmi8d.htm)\n\nYes we naturally have lazy forces. There are three forces in Yoga:\nTamasic - preserving\nRajic - changing \nSattvik - creative. \n\nMeditation is a sattvik activity. You cannot be lazy and be properly meditating.  \n\nBut so what? I was tired this week. Missed my noontime meditation today. I am a new person now, we can only act in the now. Past is gone, now is the time to set the habit to hold the future you imagine.\n\nWith that kind of self awareness, your half the battle is wonderful already. If you start focusing on thousands of  tiny micro decisions that you make make every hour, and correcting those decisions, the other half will be won too. Stay inspired.\n\n78 days! Didn't start on purpose, wasn't planning on stopping, thanks for the extra inspiration.\n\nGreat ! I am curious what made you start ?\n\nI was always a firm believer that the answers are in your mind so I do share your initial thought for doing it: Peace of mind, trying to put all my thoughts in order. But now I have found so much more, can't wait for day 100, 500, 1000, 2000. See you there.\n\nGreat ! You'll see much better than me if you stay consistent ;) I would be glad to meet you in that realm anyway\n\nWhen you work, work. When you laugh, laugh. When you eat, eat like its your last meal. Always give it 100%\n\ni like this outlook on always being present :)\n\nAmen\n\nHow long per day?\n\nAbout 20 minutes first thing in the morning and 20 minutea before aleep\n\nYou're everywhere, buddy. No complain.\n\nWonderful story, beautiful humility. Thank you for sharing\n\nthank you üôè\n\nHi Op. Did you just practice concentration in these 1600 days or did you have any other practice?\n\nHi, I've tried a lot of meditations. Mindfulness, mantra meditation, TM, sound bath, visualisation, Hong Sau and probably a few others. I was trying to find the meditation that suits me most. It ended up being just sitting down, closing my eyes and watching my breath while letting whatever happens happens\n\nCan you please detail your practice?\n\nSure. 20 minutes twice a day first thing in the morning and right before sleep. Some times when I feel the need I'll sit and meditate some more during the day. I don't time my additional meditations. I just do it when I feel overwhelmed and stop when I feel more at peace\n\nSorry,  i meant what are you doing 20 minutes twice a day?\n\nOh alright, most of the time if I'm peaceful, i'll just focus on my breath going in and out. Problem is, my mind ends up being all over the place. I keep it on leash by asking (whatever force or god you believe in) to help me stay focused on my breath. It works marvels. \nSome other times, when I am struggling, I'll focus on trying to deconstruct my suffering by focusing on what I am feeling in my body, chest pressure, knotted stomach etc once I spotted where is the pressure I just keep observing it, generally after a few minutes it just disappears\n\nCool,  thanks for that\n\nThis is exactly how I've been doing it for a while, but I took 30 minutes, also every morning and evening. And then somewhere along the way the fixed routine faded. Now it's just whenever I feel the need for more peace or clarity.\n\nStrange. Our endpoint seems to be the same but my practise is the exact opposite.\n\nCurious to know what your practice is ?\n\nI retract my statement as I read your answer to someone else (; I do however have a curiosity about your findings on your voyage when it comes to the ego. I ask because I find that when meditation really clicks Buddha's teachings seems so matter of fact. The origin of suffering and all that. To quote  Ram Dass  \"To him who has had the experience no explanation is necessary, to him who has not, none is possible\". You cannot know what's behind the door before you open it. And when you do......ah when you do. The silence. The face of God. The sights. The complete understanding of all your motivations until that moment. Another understanding of time. Understanding that yearning for all those years. The intuitive knowing that your soul was trapped. But not knowing how or when it happened. Did it happen? And then. Revelation.\n\nI am particularly sensitive to the teachings of Ram Dass and Maharaji. They guided me for a few years during a dark period in my life. Your quote from Ram Dass wraps it up about the ego.\nI'd say the ego has gotten the spot light these past few years with the enlightenment movement. Which is what ego wants. \nThe way I see it now is that it's our allotted character for a particular life, we need it but we must realize we are more than it.\n\nI believe we need a new term. Or maybe it already exists but I'm unaware. There seem to be different kinds of egos where one operates from light and the other from darkness. As it stands today ego death kind of implies creasing to exist and people recoil. But that is very far from what actually happens.\n\nRemindMe! 1 day\n\nI will be messaging you in 1 day on [**2024-07-08 20:39:45 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2024-07-08%2020:39:45%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) to remind you of [**this link**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/1dxhb5l/update_after_1600_days_of_meditation_how_it/lc3caft/?context=3)\n\n[**1 OTHERS CLICKED THIS LINK**](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&amp;subject=Reminder&amp;message=%5Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2FMeditation%2Fcomments%2F1dxhb5l%2Fupdate_after_1600_days_of_meditation_how_it%2Flc3caft%2F%5D%0A%0ARemindMe%21%202024-07-08%2020%3A39%3A45%20UTC) to send a PM to also be reminded and to reduce spam.\n\n^(Parent commenter can ) [^(delete this message to hide from others.)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&amp;subject=Delete%20Comment&amp;message=Delete%21%201dxhb5l)\n\n*****\n\n|[^(Info)](https://www.reddit.com/r/RemindMeBot/comments/e1bko7/remindmebot_info_v21/)|[^(Custom)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&amp;subject=Reminder&amp;message=%5BLink%20or%20message%20inside%20square%20brackets%5D%0A%0ARemindMe%21%20Time%20period%20here)|[^(Your Reminders)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&amp;subject=List%20Of%20Reminders&amp;message=MyReminders%21)|[^(Feedback)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=Watchful1&amp;subject=RemindMeBot%20Feedback)|\n|-|-|-|-|\n\nThe way you described this is beautiful.  I can see parts of my experience in yours, though I have a long way to go.  It‚Äôs encouraging.  You also are a sweet soul for coming back and updating.  ü´∂üèº\n\nThank you üôè\n\nThis is fantastic. Been meditating a little over 5 years everyday as well. I don‚Äôt really do seated meditation too often anymore though. Just bring presence throughout my day. You‚Äôre absolutely right in saying don‚Äôt resist the suffering. Resisting anything just creates more suffering. Letting go of concepts and ideas will bring you further liberation. Including letting go of the idea of ‚Äúthe meditator‚Äù.\n\nGood luck and wishing you all the best as you continue your journey.\n\nI don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever resonated with a Reddit post as much as this. Beautifully explained! I have experienced a lot of similarities. Very grateful for your ability to articulate it. ‚ú®\n\nSo grateful for your comment üôè thank you\n\nI‚Äôve got 3,431 consecutive days but I still haven‚Äôt kicked the habit of comparing myself to others it seems. üòä. Congrats.\n\nWhat kind of meditation do u do\n\nMostly focusing on my breath going in an out. It may vary depending on my mood and the outcome I want to achieve at the moment\n\nThanks for your post. Can you share a detailed post about different types of meditation you practice?\n\nYes, we'll do :)\n\nHave you gotten better at cessation of thought throughout your journey?\n\nThe more you try to suppress your thoughts, the more thoughts you'll have. meditation is not about being thoughtless. It's about noticing what IS without judging yourself.\n\nI would explore that idea more. The cessation of thought is a goal in buddhist and hindu meditation schools. I do not wrestle with my thoughts but I have learned how to let the thoughts die of their own accord, and meditate in complete mental silence. Almost every deep meditation and profound experiences I've had are on the other side of thought phenomenon.\n\nThank you for sharing üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\n\nOp has Aura\n\nIt is so important to realize these benefits of meditation. For me, it really is about controlling your thoughts and focusing on identifying your suffering so you can make the world a better place for yourself and others. Until I learned this I just had the impression that people simply zoned out during meditation and that is all that happens.\n\nThank you, I needed this. I have been trying to beat my procrastination and I think this will propel me forward. The experience is relatable.\n\nGlad I could help :)\n\nThis is really insightful and you ertainally have self discipline.  I was on a positive journey for a good couple of years but recently realized that I'm no longer moving. I'm at a stand-still and feel if I don't do so.ething soon, I'll end up going backwards real fast. \nGood for you\n\nStart small. Just build the habit. Even 2 minutes a day will do the job. You'll build it up from there\n\nGreat post! Thanks for sharing your experience and inspiring others!\n\nI also appreciate that you're interested in other perspectives as we tend to become attached to our own ideas especially, understandably, when they've proven useful. Perhaps it is attachment to my own perspective that motivated this response.\n\nYou mentioned \"broken self\"; this is a perspective I've also found myself caught up in. I've found it useful to balance this idea with the idea that we're already perfect as we are and the path of meditation is simply to make us aware of our perfection - a process of removing the grime from the perfect gem beneath.\n\nIn terms of confronting darkness you mention \"forcing\" the mind to look the other way. This strikes me as a bit in the realm of toxic positivity. In my own experience I've found great benefit to confronting the darkness and simply relaxing into it. It turns out our demons are merely shadows of the mind which dissipate, and transform, when a light is shone on them. Of course, as with all things, balance is warranted and there may be times avoiding the darkness is the wisest path.\n\nI really appreciate your insights into not blaming the apparent cause of our discomforts. I think this is one of the most valuable tools we can learn to employ. I sometimes take this another step and see the apparent cause as merely a trigger for something which already existed within me; a trigger which I can have gratitude towards for revealing something I might have otherwise been unaware of.\n\nThanks again for sharing these excellent insights!\n\nHi u/ThePsylosopher, thank you for sharing! I have a random question:  Have you had an experience in your past that your brain naturally blocked out, but in practicing relaxation in the shadow realm, have you been able to access memories?\n\nEdit: i don‚Äôt mean to ask you to share any specific forgotten memories (as they‚Äôre usually traumatic), but I am curious about your experience with what happens after. \n\nEdit 2: i wonder if it‚Äôs possible to access your earlier memories this way? What do you think?\n\nI've had experiences of recalling past forgotten memories through meditation though I'm not sure I can specifically attribute it to relaxing into the shadow. The aim of this approach is really more about accepting uncomfortable emotions rather than unearthing memories. \n\nWhat happens after accessing a repressed memory will really depend on how you relate to it. With acceptance I notice a lightening, an unburdening. \n\nYes, I think it's possible to use this approach to access repressed memories but I might caution you and encourage you to examine your intention. There might be a tendency to become attached to, or identify with, the memories you recall.\n\nThank you for sharing your insights. Much appreciated ! You're probably right, I'll meditate on it :) thanks again\n\nSir very informative and motivational post. I started meditation but left as I couldn‚Äôt focus on either breath or any single object and got frustrated.\n\nDo you have any suggestions how to meditate better and maintain focus.\n\nThank you for your suggestions and your time.\n\nThat's the whole point of meditation. \n1-We start restless\n2-we struggle through it\n3- we keep doing it anyway \n4- our focus improves very very gradually \n5- change starts to happen in our psychie \n6- we become more patient and less frustrated \nIt's not about a particular technique. It's about going beyond frustration\n\nYou seriously rock. Total badass. I loved reading this and feel uplifted!\n\nThank you üôè happy my post helped :) cheers\n\nThank you for sharing, I really need to go back to this practice, I am using Calm app\n\nDo whatever feels confortable to you. The main point is to keep going forward\n\nBalance app is amazing! I've tried all the apps. Balance is offering a year free membership. I use it daily, and they have lesson plans to grow your practice. There's tons of single meditations too for whatever you need in that moment.¬†\n\nI have over 16000 days of meditation and have discovered the same things as you , including the many misconceptions. Meditation needs concentration but not any focus, as I never once used my breath as a focus.  My Favorite style is non directive  because it requires nothing except concentration.\n\nHow would you describe the difference between concentration and focus?\n\nWhere we direct our mental energy is concentration, and the form it takes is focus. I only focus on meditation in order to meditate.\n\nbeautiful\n\nSave\n\nAwesome sharing. Just watch your thumb for 2 minutes with no thoughts. That will give concentration \n\nI do have this and others on my YouTube channel. I am not sure we are allowed to share our channel?\n\nIf you think it could help people reduce suffering, share it anyway\n\nLight Meditation PSL\nhttps://youtu.be/HYUaALgyrq0\n\nThumb Meditation PSL\nhttps://youtu.be/Sk0Bey-ttAY\n\nThumb Meditation PSL\nhttps://youtu.be/Sk0Bey-ttAY\n\nI quite enjoyed that. I usually practice mindfulness. I haven't used a point of focus yet, and the thumb meditation is so easy to do anywhere. I got lost in it. Thanks for sharing.¬†\n\nüôè that is awesome\n\nAwesome! Question how do you meditate? Silence? With music? Guided? Can you tell us more about the process please?\n\nI'll make a full post about this, a lot of people had the same questions\n\nüôè\n\nA beginner here. Can you take me through the process of your meditation journey? How did you start? What was exactly your process? \n \nHow did you tackle the distractions/ issues / sufferings popping in while meditating? \nYour reply will be helpful, thank you!\n\nHey, I'll make a post about it in the next few days to be able to give you a thorough and constructive answer\n\nI will really appreciate that, it will be super helpful. Thank you!\n\nThanks for sharing. Great insights.\n\n&gt; Remember, meditation isn't about escaping suffering, but about developing a new relationship with it. \n\nThis is very profound and encouraging, thank you so much!\n\nThis is just what I needed to read today. I am on Day 55 and today was the first day I missed my morning meditation. I will make time this evening for it. I am just at the stage of being diligent about the practice and am enjoying it so far. I did the Waking Up intro course and that gave me a few different experiences of just sitting and observing which I found to be different. I picked up the Illuminated Mind book and am currently trying to follow the suggestions in there. I like it because it seems to know every obstacle that I come up against and it gives me a way to deal with it that does not involve fighting with the situation.\n\nCommenting so I remember to read this in the morning (past 1am here) buy also because hell yes! I remember your original post, and I took a lot of encouragement from it. I've been very stop/start this year, but recently did a midyear \"reset\" so I'm on day 8 of my journey again. How fortuitous that your post has popped up to encourage me again. Now just... 992 days to go before I get to make my own üòâ\n\nMan thanks to you I now know what having a raving fan feels like üòÖ just kidding of course, glad to cross roads again\n\nInteresting!! Thank you!!\n\nI have been meditating for 5 years on and off sometimes stretching to daily meditation of 6 months. I took breaks in between intentionally because the perspective shifts of the world was becoming overwhelming to integrate with day to day people and activities. \n\nThank you for sharing your insights on suffering, this is something I have a hard time understanding &amp; I am definitely going to use your tips\n\nI have shifted my practice from more secular(Buddhist way) to understanding the divine presence. Learing about the esoteric practices in the Shakti traditions, which opened up a whole new dimension of understanding reality. The synchronicities I have seen in recent years gave me goosebumps. I have accomplished things in life that I only dreamt off as a child.\n\nI learnt to control my ‚Äúmeditative‚Äù mind because living like that 24/7 was overwhelming for me. I think at this point I would need a master to guide me but I dont want to box myself to a certain path because thats does not feel freeing to me. \n\nDo you have any tips for solo practitioners ?\n\nHey, I am glad you've found my tips for overcoming suffering useful. I had the same shift in my practice even though it happened instinctevely. Do you have any books about shakti you would recommend ?   \nIn order to give you relevant tips, can you share your actual practice ? Feel free to DM\n\nIf only everyone meditated the world would be a different place\n\nWhen you meditate to a certain point. Your body becomes one pure energy like a light bulb.  You don‚Äôt feel legs, hands, thoughts and rest of the body existing -all just become one pure and clear energy.  From my own experience.\n\nThanks for sharing üôè\n\nI am a fellow meditator- I learned in 2017 and have kept it up. It is a practical and dignified way to live. I especially enjoy the perspective it gives. I would never claim that I am always serene, but I most definitely don‚Äôt take life as personally as I once did. The one hurdle I have come up against is when I resist joy- almost as if I am too small to contain it all. Work in progress\n\nArm jewelry\n\nHow long do you usually meditate for?\n\nThanx for sharing üíñ\n\n[removed]\n\nMeditation is the best way to acquire the virtue of patience. Start with short meditations. Just build the habit of sitting down eyes closed. Even a minute or two will do.\n\nBeginner here as well. I just discovered an app called The Way, from Henry Shukman.  I respect his training and philosophy, and what I like is this app is a specific day by day progressive path for all to follow, so there‚Äôs no clutter and no having to figure out which method or school might be best.  It‚Äôs free so far (first 30 days I believe), so enough time to decide if it works for you.  Plus he has a wonderful soothing voice and gentle manner.\n\nDo you meditate with your eyes open?\n\nWhat occurs differently in the mind and body when eyes are opened versus when eyes are closed while meditating?\n\nI've tried both. Now I only do it with my eyes closed. Do whatever is confortable to you. When the eyes are open your focus can be altered by the the things you see\n\nCan't your focus be altered by the things you imagine?\n\nI guess what I'm saying is just because my eyes are closed doesn't mean I'm focused. \n\nWhat's been your experience with meditating with your eyes open?\n\nAnd...\n\nWhat's been your experience with meditating with your eyes closed?\n\nYes you are right.\nEyes closed I focus on 1 thought, my breathing or a body sensations. Eyes open, I focus on a candle. Both work for me but eyes close helps me dive deeper into the meditative state and feel more at peace\n\nI see. \n\nThanks for clarifying.\n\nSuch a positive and helpful share. Thank you!\n\nGlad it helped ! Thank you buddy üôè\n\nWow, amazing experience and determination, well done OP, well done! \n\nWhat type of meditation do you do? \nWhat is the best way to get started? \nWhat books do you recommend that would help to understand how to start and the process that the mind and the body go through? \nWhat app would you say is best for daily mediation?\n\nSorry for all the questions and thank you in advance!\n\nGreat progress ! Seems like you practice Vipassana more often than not. I think you might like a tiny blog I made previously - [https://thecosmicjoke.wordpress.com/](https://thecosmicjoke.wordpress.com/)  \nThanks for the cool share !\n\nFollow.\n\nCongrats. How many hours each day did you practice? And which technique? Following the breath? Loving kindness?...\n\nI've tried a few, now I just follow my breath or body scan when I am struggling with some king of suffering. When I feel overwhelmed I'll just drop a prayer to the universe to help me focus and it usually works\n\nWhat motivated you to start?\n\nSuffering to the point of having recurring dark thoughts and hudge loads of anxiety. So I'd say hopelessness\n\nWith that much meditation have you felt an increase in your intuitive abilities? If so do you have any examples of how your abilities have helped you?\n\nEveryone is intuitive. Our minds are generally too busy with stuff to see clearly the ever present intuitions. \nMeditation helps improve focus. Which means it becomes easier to empty our minds. And when we don't think, the only thing that stays is consciousness of all that's happening, including intuitions.\n\nThank you so much for this op!\n\nYou're most welcome :)\n\nOP , do you take any particular position before you meditate? Spine straight and cross legged? Did you change it over the years? \nThank for inspiring us.\n\nYou're most welcome :) spine straight is a must in my opinion other than that wether you're doing it sitting down on a chair, lying down or cross legged won't change the nature of the experience. The main point is consistency and doing what feels comfortable, especially when you're starting out. \nI do it cross legged in my bed most of the time.\n\nThank you so much for this inspiring and kind post üíñüôè all the best to you on your continued journey! You've certainly encouraged me :)\n\nI am happy it did :) bless you\n\nBless you too! üíñ\n\n[deleted]\n\nStart small. Just build the habit. 2 minutes a day before sleep will do. You'll build it up from there. Take it easy on yourself\n\n/u/karza89 - Very good insights, thanks for sharing your experiences. Many questions!\n\nWhat form of meditation do you practice? \nHow long per day? \nHas your practice changed over time? \nIf so were the changes intentional?\nDo you have a community to practice with or more individual meditation?\n\nShort answer : \nVipassana meditation mostly even though I do body scan and mantra some times. \nYes it it did change. It's not a fixed practice, it's an ever evolving process.\nSometimes the changes are intentional, some other times it just happens by itself and I notice it. \nI don't have a community just emptiness, my restless mind and me. I'll make a full post about how I started, a lot of people asked the same questions\n\nAwesome questions!!\n\nOP, I just started my journey. Any advice for a novice?\n\nHow long everyday sir?\n\n20 minutes twice a day\n\nDo you have a third eye yet?\n\nI noticed you meditate for 20 minutes twice a day, do you see more benefit in doing it that way compared to one long session?\n\nNot really. It's just more practical for me that way. Do whatever feels confortable as long as you're consistent\n\nThank you for sharing. I love how you write. The words you use and how you made it flow smoothly and straight forward\nMay you continue to be enriched more and more on your journey of life.\n\nThank you so much üôè\n\nI like the way you speak friend\n\nThank you üôè\n\nExcellent. I can corroborate all you have said so clearly. Meditation is pragmatic. It becomes a guide to sanity and beyond. The only journey in life worthy of the investment of time, patience, courage and unbending intent. üôèüïâÔ∏è\n\nThank you üôèboy are there circumstances that tried to bend my intent . Grateful I kept going\n\nBeautiful! Absolutely astonishing what you‚Äôve accomplished and furthermore how you‚Äôve expressed your experiences. Thankyou soo much for making this post. You are truly such an inspiration and your insight has given me a new perspective on meditation overall. I‚Äôm forever grateful as I move along my own path of enlightenment. Best of luck to you in all of your endeavors, continue to inspire!\n\nThank you so much üôè glad it helped, it was the whole point\n\nHey man. Really appreciate the share/outlook on your time, also congrats on the milestone I‚Äôve been on and off meditating for years! I want to collect my 100days milestone by the end of the year and build from there‚Ä¶ \n\nJust a couple of questions‚Ä¶\n\nHave you ever had any weird/wonderful experiences during meditation? \n\nHow long do you meditate for? Did it change over the duration of meditating for so long? \n\nAny tips to stay on track/being consistent? \n\nAll the best :)\n\nAbsolutely love this!!!\n\nThank you üôè\n\nHow do it changed your fears ? \nIf you had any anxiety do you feel different about it ? \nI feel like one of the first things meditation gives you is calm and that might reflect to\nOther aspects of life\n\nLike moving sands, the more we struggle to get out the deeper we get. The more we struggle with anxiety the more anxious we get. Meditation helps to get calm indeed and allows me to accept things as they are, which ends up freeing me from anxiety.\n\nHey, thanks for your post.\n\nHow do you maintain your practice when your circumstances change? \n\nFor example I am able to keep a routine with meditating every day when I have a structure and good living situation.\nBut the moment I leave my house, for a weekend away or holiday or someone comes to visit I loose my motivation to sit and find it hard to meditate when changes are happening around me.\n\nAny advice would be very welcome üôèüèº\n\nI still go through the same lack of motivation though a thought helpes me overcome it. \n\"Would I skip brushing my teeth ? Never. Meditation is brushing my mind\"\n\nDo you ever find it difficult or like extra hard to sit and meditate when your staying in someone else‚Äôs space or on holiday? I find it really hard when I‚Äôm not in my own room\n\nYeah it's harder but I do it anyway and it becomes easier the more I do\n\nDid you do any pranayama like Tummo or Sama vritti, etc to enhance/compliment etc. your meditation practice.  I find your post inspiring.  Thank you\n\nI've always wanted to try tummo. I will do so and see how it goes. Thank you\n\nOk then help me with one thing my friend.. which meditation made to so consistent? There must be something u started with and then something to stay consistent with and what you doing now? I mean, guided meditations or what? Any app suggestions?? Any YouTube channel suggestions? Kindly guide..\n\nHi, I will post a step by step guide to meditation for beginners in the next few days. Stay tune friend\n\nWaiting üòä\n\nHey did u post guide to meditation? Hope I have not missed..\n\nHey yes I did check my last post :)\n\nThis was amazing! Could you shed some more light about what you meant by you how you identified the cause, stopped blaming it, and reframed? Particularly the stopped blaming and reframing part. What does that look like practically?\n\nHere's an example: 1- I notice a certain recurring thought pattern that nourish my suffering 2- After a while just observing the pattern I end up understanding where it originated from. Let's say because a childhood trauma 3- I get to a point where I link that trauma to something a parent did or said 4- I blame that parent 5- I forgive the parent and own the thought pattern 6- I work on thinking differently whenever that thought pattern happens automatically 7- at some point, the old pattern is replaced by the new one \nI hope this helps\n\nThank you for your very articulated and well-written post, OP.\n\nI have a question for you: with regard to meditation, how did you deal with personal expectations?\n\nMy practice is very similar to yours: closing my eyes and watching my breath, and coming back to it when distractions occur. But I'm starting to realize that when I think about or do meditation, I nurture a very subtle longing for being able to hold my attention perfectly and uninterruptedly on one single thought, or one single action (like my breath).\n\nI do know this desire puts unnecessary pressure on my practice, but I can't help but notice it emerging every time I think about (or do) meditation.\n\nDid something similar happened to you in your journey? How did you deal with it? Did you just keep sitting until it all melts away?\n\nYes it happened to me and still happens sometimes. I just notice and keep going. I trained myself with time to see the practice as the goal and I am not looking for any outcome anymore. It's about training the mind. We live in a society of achievement so our brains automatically want to be goal oriented in any endeavor including meditation when meditation is about not looking to achieve anything other than being present to what is\n\nYes, you are right. So, would you consider that meditation is an action you practice or a state you put yourself into? I believe language is very important, and having a proper way of expressing something reframes our way of approaching it.\n\nI would define meditation as the intentional action of non action. The more we do it the more our brains get used to doing nothing and thinking about nothing. At some point, we achieve the meditative state where we are just a conscious presence. It is very paradoxical but if we chase the meditative state we are producing thoughts and desire which keeps us out of that state. By not looking to achieve that state nor anything else we may achieve it. That's my actual understanding anyway\n\nAny books you‚Äôd recommend for synchronization?\n\nWhat do you mean by synchronization ?\n\nI didn‚Äôt know what synchronization meant in a more spiritual way so I wanted to learn about it bc you mentioned it in post\n\nHow do you keep up your meditation practice when you are ill? Do you do anything different at those times?\n\nIf Ii feel pain, i use it as a meditation medium. I just focus on the pain. Very efficient in many ways\n\nyour mention likes 'budism'\n\n&gt; I now instinctively perceive the causes behind events and sense a spiritual guidance shaping my path.\n\nOh yeah. I feel this way often. \n\n&gt; Again, I persisted, which led to acceptance which led to synchronicities \n\nI feel like these synchronicities happen a lot more often now as well.\n\n‚ÄúSingle pointed focus‚Äù\n\nThank you for this inspiring post! I saw in your comment history that a year ago you were struggling with feeling lonely in the world, like you had no one you could truly connect with anymore because now you¬† saw the world so differently from your loved ones. How did that work itself out? I'm going through that phase right now, would appreciate insight and tips.\n\nYou're welcome. Honestly, at some point I just stopped complaining and started to try new things. I started studying for a masters degree I've always wanted to do, building new relationships, community work... Basically getting out there and out of my comfort zone. very uncomfortable at first but it ends up changing everything :)\n\nThank you sharing this. I really resonated with 4. Sensing life differently. You put into words what I always thought.\n\n1600 days, wow‚Äîthat‚Äôs some serious dedication! i‚Äôve been meditating for just a few months, and it‚Äôs already been such an eye-opener. totally get what you‚Äôre saying about facing suffering head-on; just sitting with it can be uncomfortable but surprisingly clarifying. came across this article on bhakti that dives into similar ideas about spirituality and self-discovery. thought you might vibe with it. Here's the link if you want to read [https://gilliambates.substack.com/p/the-wisdom-of-bhakti](https://gilliambates.substack.com/p/the-wisdom-of-bhakti)\n\nJust this.\nAnd a heart as wide as the world."

    "all_comment_text": "This is described in The Mind Illuminated as well. The first 3 stages are about FAM, then at stage 4 he introduces what you call OMM, only he calls it awareness. It is a general awareness of what's going on in your body and/or mind, while your attention still stays on the breath.\n\nWhat you wrote about the self=illusion suddenly \"clicking\" is very interesting. These insights sometimes just happen. I like to think of it like exercise or weight loss - sometimes you hit a plateau and it feels like you're not progressing, but if you keep working on it, you will see a jump sooner or later.\n\nIt‚Äôs worth mentioning that TMI separates awareness into peripheral awareness (raw sense information) and introspective awareness (awarwness of the content of consciousness).\n\nDeveloping peripheral awareness contributes to increasing mindfulness, which Culadasa describes (rightly, I think) as the correct balance at any point in time between attention and awareness.\n\nIntrospective awareness eventually develops into metacognitive introspective awareness, where the workings of the mind, not its content, are what‚Äôs being observed.\n\nAlso: The Mind Illuminated is available as a [free pdf download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16pKrr74_4bnYc6GqQeScou9riGhxtst4/view). And there‚Äôs a sub: r/TheMindIlluminated.\n\nCan you tell I‚Äôm a fan? :-)\n\nIt's a great book!\n\nTotally. I‚Äôve been meditating for ~35 years (with breaks) and it‚Äôs changing my practice and my life.\n\npen file worry fear caption ruthless books bag political meeting\n\n *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev/home)*\n\n&gt;Maybe those were muscles I needed to train first.\n\nI think this is accurate, and is why most meditation courses start with FAM and then progress to something more open (often Vipassana, which is more open than Anapana but of course not as open as choiceless awareness/open monitoring) when stable/secure attention (the ability to let attention \"rest\" on an object, and a reflexive response to wandering) has been developed.\n\nNo doubt, meditation, pranayam, mantas chanting do help but more important is to keep yourself occupied in various activities, meeting friends and attending public gatherings, family functions.\n\nThis makes me think of the structure of the 10-day Vipassana, where the first 3 days or so are just spent focussing on the breath, after which you gradually start focussing on being aware of sensations on or in the body. I found it to be a surprising shift in technique at the time, but looking back (and reading about your experiences) it makes sense: starting with a solid basis of FAM and then introducing OMM once you‚Äôre able to hold your concentration a bit better. \n\nI actually found the first three days the hardest - moving to sensations felt like a breath of fresh air and a lot more engaging than just sticking to the breath itself :)\n\nThere is a episode of Harris Podcast with Loch Kelly I think was his name where they discuss pointing out techniques and explain that for some people it works best to have a slow build up to this moment but for others it‚Äôs the exact opposite. \n\nInterestingly they also mentioned that if someone was to be exposed to this too early or too late it will not have that much of an impact on them or even deter them from further investigating. I believe there is some truth and similarity to any step in meditation in that. \n\nAnyway I‚Äôm happy for you and wish you the best with your new insight. I‚Äôd like to add that I still believe the FAM work has still its place and I do practice it as well.\n\nFor further reading on this maybe check: Awaken Awareness by Loch Kelly\n\nI did one of his non meditations on insight timer and it unzipped some wild stuff in my head.¬† It was amazing to just exist.¬† I felt like I could feel neurotransmitters dumping in my brain.¬†\n\n\"It doesn't have to be the breath. It can be everything. Everything is worth paying attention to.\" - I think this is the essence of meditation in the end, no matter what the technique is? \n\nIn Mindfulness in Plain English, the author very clearly talks about how awareness and concentration are two different aspects of meditation which have to be worked on concurrently. When you talk about OMM, it sounds to me like awareness, and when you talk of FAM, that's concentration. They're both different and essential, and surely people find one a lot easier than the other, but maybe it is important to try to develop both.\n\n  \nBut I'm glad you've figured out what works for you and it's made such a marked difference in your life! &lt;3\n\nrock crush practice shrill spark aware hungry versed bells arrest\n\n *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev/home)*\n\nIt's like how cardio helps with endurance in every other physical activity. Anapanasati is like polishing a lens, so when you use it with another type of meditation (telescope), like Vipassana, things are that much more clear.\n\n&gt;In Mindfulness in Plain English, the author very clearly talks about how awareness and concentration are two different aspects of meditation which have to be worked on concurrently.\n\nThis is addressed in [The Mind Illuminated](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16pKrr74_4bnYc6GqQeScou9riGhxtst4/view) as well.\n\nI.e. Samatha and Vipassana meditation.\n\nBut do you think this concentration practice you did was building the basis for this realization? Thanks for the interesting post!\n\nI think your hypothesis is correct.  Concentration is the foundation more advanced practice is built on.\n\nExactly. It's a bit like OP spent several months strength training, then suddenly found picking up heavy things in day-to-day life was easier.\n\naback test fact fuzzy telephone voracious ghost spark drab library\n\n *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev/home)*\n\nI bet you have improved and just haven't realized it. But I guarantee that FAM is still benefiting you in some way, even without you doing it anymore.\n\nChoiceless awareness\n\nA story - \n\n*One day Buddha is passing by a forest. It is a hot summer day and he is feeling very thirsty. He says to Ananda, his chief disciple, ‚ÄúAnanda, you go back. Just three, four miles back we passed a small stream of water. You bring a little water ‚Äî take my begging bowl. I am feeling very thirsty and tired.‚Äù He had become old.*\n\n*Ananda goes back, but by the time he reaches the stream, a few bullock carts have just passed through the stream and they have made the whole stream muddy. Dead leaves which had settled into the bed have risen up; it is no longer possible to drink this water ‚Äî it is too dirty. He comes back empty-handed, and he says, ‚ÄúYou will have to wait a little. I will go ahead. I have heard that just two, three miles ahead there is a big river. I will bring water from there.‚Äù*\n\n*But Buddha insists. He says, ‚ÄúYou go back and bring water from the same stream.‚Äù*\n\n*Ananda could not understand the insistence, but if the master says so, the disciple has to follow. Seeing the absurdity of it ‚Äî that again he will have to walk three, four miles, and he knows that water is not worth drinking ‚Äî he goes.*\n\n*When he is going, Buddha says, ‚ÄúAnd don‚Äôt come back if the water is still dirty. If it is dirty, you simply sit on the bank silently. Don‚Äôt do anything, don‚Äôt get into the stream. Sit on the bank silently and watch. Sooner or later the water will be clear again, and then you fill the bowl and come back.‚Äù*\n\n*Ananda goes there. Buddha is right: the water is almost clear, the leaves have moved, the dust has settled. But it is not absolutely clear yet, so he sits on the bank just watching the river flow by. Slowly slowly, it becomes crystal-clear. Then he comes dancing. Then he understands why Buddha was so insistent. There was a certain message in it for him, and he understood the message. He gave the water to Buddha, and he thanked Buddha, touched his feet.*\n\n*Buddha says, ‚ÄúWhat are you doing? I should thank you that you have brought water for me.‚Äù*\n\n*Ananda says, ‚ÄúNow I can understand. First I was angry; I didn‚Äôt show it, but I was angry because it was absurd to go back. But now I understand the message. This is what I actually needed in this moment. The same is the case with my mind ‚Äî sitting on the bank of that small stream, I became aware that the same is the case with my mind. If I jump into the stream I will make it dirty again. If I jump into the mind more noise is created, more problems start coming up, surfacing. Sitting by the side I learned the technique.*\n\ngood lesson.¬†\n\nI also find other ways more effective than focusing on breath when meditating. When I let my awareness just be and catch anything that appears on body or mind, i feel like my body naturally stop being in tension and I get more of a feeling of here and now if that makes sense.\n\nI‚Äôll change my way of meditation from FAM to OMM today, I have same troubles like you described.

The self is the character in the story being played out with the other characters. It‚Äôs a very interesting and immersive story, and you can work toward being a good character. But at the end of the play, it‚Äôs a story being told by actors. The actor is the perspective of the awareness, of watching and being the character-self and the stage we are on. The character is part of the story, they are a constructed figment, an illusion. When the character‚Äôs story is over, the actor remains. Perhaps it is the same actor who embodies different characters. \n\nI like the idea that everything is worth paying attention to in the story. It‚Äôs a very beautiful stage, and all the characters are profound and compelling, including the one you‚Äôre playing. I hope we all get a happy ending.\n\nBeautifully percepted and written.

I like to be playful when I'm having a good meditation session. But \"good\" to me doesn't only mean sitting there in total silence and awareness of the oneness without distractions. Though that's good too. But a thought will come up and I'll just observe it like it's a little messenger come to report something and sometimes I'll follow it and get incredible insights from whatever unfolds. If you like Pokemon, I like to think of it as Mew / MewTwo dynamic. One is playful and innocent. The other is serious and disciplined (after the chaos). They're sides of the same coin.\n\nI am currently experiencing what you experience.

I will save this post to refer back to. I really loved the way you were present with others and will use this to help my own interactions with others¬†\n\nHOLY SHIT. I am new to meditating, I started this may. In the beginning I read a comment of Some guy here that said a good technique is to ‚Äúwatch your thoughts as if they were clouds on the sky‚Äù. I immediately noticed changes in my behavior similar to yours.\n\nThis was all while knowing almost nothing about meditation. Around a month ago I found out that many people don‚Äôt actually meditate that way, instead they watch and focus om their breath. Ever since I have been doing that, I have lost all progress and motivation, and have the same experience as you.\n\nTl;dr: I have the same experience about OMM/FAM, but did not know these were actually 2 distinct concepts/methods.\n\nThank you for this post!

I read (maybe even on this sub) the quote: \"That is all life is. Breathing in, breathing out. The space between two breaths.\" with challenge to be aware of what is happening between the breaths. \n\nTo make a long story short, I was so focused on creating the space between the two breaths, that I forgot to take the second one.\n\nmarket terrific tart innocent historical rustic encourage bewildered shrill squeal\n\n *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev/home)*\n\nHi Ty! i wanna try this\n\n[deleted]\n\nteeny airport rotten existence worm sort tidy unused drab lavish\n\n *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev/home)*\n\nIndeed, this would be very helpful.

    "title": "I've been meditating for 40 minutes (2x20) a day for one month - this is what it did for me",
    "body": "I've been meditating for a few years already but I was never able to find a consistent routine. As a result, I often didn't feel like meditating and regularly got 'stuck' in my meditation journey. It always felt more of an obligation than something I really enjoyed and benefited from. So I decided to be strict with myself and complete a 2x20 minute meditation challenge for thirty days. This is what I've learned.\n\n* **It's a clich√©, but really: meditating doesn't have to be perfect**. At first, when my mind was busy and meditating was difficult, afterwards I felt like I had failed. Now I now that literally every meditation is useful. Because every conscious breath you take, blurs out the outside world just a little bit more and therefore brings you closer to yourself. Even if you manage to do only three conscious breaths in five minutes, it's a win. Meditating is about centering yourself, again and again and again - and once you get familiair with that, it's the best feeling ever.\n* In line with the above: your meditation doesn't have to be perfect because it's more about¬†**how you apply being mindful in your daily life**. Maybe you catch yourself running from one thing to another and decide to take a few deep breaths before continuing your way. Or, in a moment of boredom, you decide to stare out of the window for a bit instead of grabbing your phone to scroll through Instagram. Such little things are all big wins, and you'll experience them more and more even if your meditations aren't all perfect and peaceful.\n* **Meditation makes you less reactive to your environment.**¬†With a consistent practice you'll be able to keep your focus and energy to yourself. As a result, things that happen outside your control no longer have such an impact on you. While meditating, I sometimes like to visualize a white/yellowish 'light of control' around me, in which I'm happy and peaceful and nothing or no one can bother me. It really helps me cut the crap of others and live for myself.\n* **Thanks to meditation I lost interest in social media.**¬†Being less reactive and more in tune with yourself, automatically makes what other people do less interesting. Because why watching other peoples lives all the time instead of living yours!? Social media is crazy when you think about it. After two weeks of consistent meditation I already ditched Instagram (besides reddit the only social media app I had). I just don't need it anymore, it's not even a struggle. I read a lot now, which I'm very happy about, because as a child I looooved reading but as an adult I lost that hobby unfortunately.\n* **During your most difficult meditations you learn the most.**¬†Yes, I still don't feel like meditating sometimes. But in the end those are always the meditations I need the most and from which I learn the most, not only about myself but also about meditation itself. Plus: focusing on your breath while your mind is¬†*screaming*¬†is the best way to become a 'good' meditator. Remember: every conscious breath is a win.\n\nAfter a month of meditating 40 minutes a day I don't wanna go back anymore.",

You‚Äôre the one putting labels on it, not them\n\nFirst\nAttempt\nIn\nLearning \n\nüëÜSomeone put this sign up in my classroom once\n\nHow exactly does one fail?\n\nWhen you make mistakes but continue not to learn from them\n\nFor me, if it is reversible, is not a failure.\n\nThere are very few things, if any, that are truly reversible.\n\nThere is also no failure other than that what results from the three poisons, and even these poisons are written down as painted pictures that applies to us and were made for us to understand, but ultimately will be washed away like a mandala in dzogchen afaik.\n\n30 days isn‚Äôt a habit though. Habits are almost instinctual, not planned out. They don‚Äôt require working up the nerve or focus or whatever you need to get them done.\n\nLike, wiping after a poo is a habit. It requires no effort. The way you tie a shoe is a habit. Probably the way you put on a shirt or jacket. They‚Äôre automatic, triggered by context that‚Äôs associated with their performance.¬†\n\n30 days isn‚Äôt enough time for something to be wired into our brain circuitry. It will take multiple months, at least, for that to be the case.¬†\n\n&gt;**Meditation makes you less reactive to your environment.**\n\nTrue story. And this is a great help when the world seems to be falling apart. Congratulations, I am on the same path of making meditation a habit.\n\nBeautiful said. Need to get back to it\n\ncongratulations üôè really good point about being mindful in your daily life.\n\nGreat post, very encouraging, thank you üëç\n\nI agree, Great post. It seems so useless when you start out but it really does start to pay off.\n\nThis is a wonderful mantra and if it works for you, brilliant x\nI‚Äôd love to hear more if you‚Äôre available sometime.\nI meditate but struggle with sleep due to ADHD, ptsd and other conditions. \nThank you for your post\n\nJust a question, but how did you keep track of the time? Did you have an alarm or something? \n\nAlso, doesn't keeping track of time kinda take you out of it? \n\nAlternatively, I always understood time to be a construct, and ultimately non-existent. So meditation for me is my time to exist \"outside of time\". \n\nThat's just my experience and nobody has to follow it, I am just asking, and sharing my side as perspective.\n\nAfter some practice, you just kinda get a feel for when the time is about right, is my experience. You can have a watch down by your side and glance at it. If you're a bit short, you just continue. If you're long, it doesn't matter.\n\nI time myself and when I think about the time I go back to the breath without trying to analyse why I thought of the time. I try and use it as a method of practice. If I had more time I would do it untimed, unfortunately don't have it at the moment.\n\nI use my phone timer on vibrate; we also do this in my digital sangha (a Zoom sit), and whoever is doing the timer rings a real bell gently for the rest of us as if we were all present.\n\nI also set a timer. It's just easier, I also don't wanna be late for work haha, but meditating without timer is of course the best way to do it. But I'm not sure if I'm there yet\n\nI can go into a long trance \n\n\nOnly to see that 5 min have passed.\n\nThanks for sharing!\n\nThis is a great reminder.  Consistency is the key.  Make space and try....you will be rewarded\n\nYeah it killed off social media interest in myself as well. That  said, I am still on Reddit lol. \n\nI also started to read again. Cheers OP!\n\nBeautifully written. Every conscious breath is a win!\n\nThanks for sharing. I've been thinking of doing a 30-day challenge to get back into routine, and maybe this is the push I needed. I absolutely agree with your sentiment of being less reactive to your environment.\n\nDo it!! You won't regret\n\nNamaste...üôè There's not one comment posted here expressing the benefits that anyone has actually received from their meditation, or is it musings! It's not difficult to meditate. As a matter of fact, it's relatively easy. Consider this, if you can run, you can walk. If you can think, you can mediate, period! All it takes is a little discipline, to sit quietly with yourself (sans the ego), having a technique/sound/mantra, allowing yourself to transcend into the deeper levels of your consciousness, layer by layer, like the skin of an onion, until you get to the very kernel at the center. The very essence of self. The one who is meditating. Raising your awareness...  ~jai guru dev\n\nThis is so good...you explained things very well!!\n\nThank you for sharing! It is very useful.\n\nThank you for sharing, I needed this today üôè\n\nWhen you meditate, do you specifically focus on ‚Äúbreathe in, breathe out‚Äù? I‚Äôm trying to get into meditation but am neurodivergent and the concept of focusing on your breath is for some reason so hard for me\n\nYes just focus on the breath, it'll get easier after some time. It was difficult for me at first too, I'm also neurodivergent.\n\nThank you!!! I am attracted to sound so I might just focus on the sound of my breathing. Best wishes ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nI want to help you getting started. Try this prompt: \"Observe all sensations that arise in your body\"\nCan you do that ? Try for 10 seconds \n\nIf you can't, what did you perceive instead?\n\nThis is great thank you!\n\nWhat also helps: starting with one hand on the belly and the other on the chest. Once you‚Äôre familiair with the movement of the breath, you can lay your hands on your lap. Oh and look into ‚Äòocean breath‚Äô, a very easy and useful technique to lay more focus on the breath (especially when you‚Äôre attracted to sounds)\n\nI meditate while walking in a garden outside near my home while listening to the Power of Now..and man it is so blissful and beautiful I forget everything. I look at the trees and flowers taking them all in and it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm actually seeing them for the first time in my life. I‚Äôm more mindful now and focused on myself I barely use social media. I get what you‚Äôre saying\n\nI‚Äôm no expert, but when my kid says it‚Äôs too hard I say it‚Äôs hard for everyone and accepting that is part of the process. For me it was liberating when I realized that. I don‚Äôt have to be good at it. Sometimes I have to start over and over for however minutes. It‚Äôs fine.\n\nTotally agree.. any time you‚Äôre meditating it‚Äôs time for you, and you only. And that‚Äôs precious.\n\nI also have been trying to make meditation a daily habit, but keep procrastinating. thank you for the inspiration, i'll focus more on the consistency\n\nThat's so amazing, congratulations\n\nAgree w op, only failure is not doing the sit. Attendance is key when building habits. Don't need to focus on optimisation when your issue is sitting on the floor and showing up. \n\n\nI've currently got a prop bet going for $50 a day where I miss a session. In the past 4 weeks I've missed 3 days. \n\nThe minimum requirement is 5 minutes. Is it laziness or is there something deeper to look into? Why so much avoidance and resistance about sitting for 5 minutes. Whats my mind running from? \n\nI agree w social media raking your time and attention. Soon we will all be deformed anatomically with prawn shaped cervical spines and have ADHD. \n\nMeditation is the way forward üôè ‚ú®Ô∏è üòå üôå üíõ\n\nSo inspiring! I will also try this as a routine for 30 days. I tried earlier, but I was never strict enough with myself, and after the initial days, I didn't keep up with it. Now I am excited to give it a try :)\n\nWelldone\n\nLOVE this break down of meditation. Resonates  with me very much ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nAlso tried to make meditation a habit, but after 2 weeks i failed congrats that you lasted might try it again\n\n&gt;and once you get familiair with that, it's the best feeling ever.\n\n&gt;After a month of meditating 40 minutes a day I don't wanna go back anymore\n\nThat's it...\n\nI recently upped my tiniest 40mins, before this 20-30 mins at best was all I could do. When you keep practicing you do get better at controlling your mind....live your life but keep meditating. Great post!\n\nControlling your mind, huh! Therein lies the paradox.\n\nYeah, it should've read \"controlling\" the mind.\n\nCool\n\nI will probably get a lot of hate for this but i am currently reading Joe Dispenza's book \"Breaking the habit of being yourself\" and alongside, i am meditating for at least 30 mins. I have meditated before but have not been consistent so reading the book to motivate me. Been a week and i feel less reactive to outside things than before. Hopefully i can continue my journey and discover the incredible joys that meditation brings. üôÇ\n\nWhy do you think you get a lot of hate for reading Joe Dispenza's? I am curious!\n\nI have read a lot of comments here that think he is all fluff and what he teaches isnt real meditation.\n\nWhat was your schedule? Can you share the meditation link/video\n\nI just set a timer and focus on my breath! Don't want to be dependent on video's or other kind of guided meditations, although they can be very helpful in the beginning.\n\nMy experience with social networks are similar.\nI left instagram, and removed FB app as I lost the interest in constant need for keep it up, and FOMO.\n\nOther things I‚Äôve noticed, as a big film enthusiast, I can‚Äôt watch horror and extreme violent films anymore.\n\nI also have this, but at the same time I don't even wanna watch those movies anymore. Being mindful makes you really conscious of the effects certain things (and people!) have on you\n\nPlease elaborate on the yellow light of control. I love this and want to try it for myself!\n\nGoogle 'circle of control' for inspiration. You can think of the white/yellow light as a protection of your peace and visualize it all around your body while meditating. Meanwhile you can say mantra's in your head (like 'my happiness is whole' or as simple as 'i am happy and peaceful') or you can use your breath to make the light 'grow'. So breath in: sucking all your energy into yourself, breath out: light grows a little and makes you stronger. Just experiment a little with these kind of techniques and find out what suits you!\n\nI can relate to this quite a bit. It was a great read!\n\nThank you.\n\nThank you for the inspiration! I'm going to meditate right now üôè\n\nI too want to meditate but i don't find the right to do so. Is it ok to try to meditate before my sleep?\n\nOf course! What suits you\n\nI've been meditating for around 3 months now, 10 minutes a day on average.¬†I feel like my concentration still is crap. Not planning to stop though.\n\nMaybe try 2x10 minutes? For me it helps a lot to meditatie twice a day, because it 'sandwiches' my day between two practices which makes it easier to remind myself to be mindful in daily life.\n\nThank you for sharing your experience! It's a good reminder to keep it up. After about 3 months you begin to establish a habit, generally spoken, they say. From there on, it's something you need and like and don't want to miss out, regarding different teachers.\n\nWill you keep meditating daily ?\n\nThanQ so much for this. I'm saving your post to keep revisiting whilst trying to stick to practice daily for a set time.  \n\nAwesome stuff. Thanks for sharing your light ü•∞\n\nCongratulations on getting started and sticking with your practice. For me meditation is not so much about what you gain as it is about what you let go of. The benefits of meditation are many and I‚Äôm happy to hear that you are enjoying the results of your practice\n\nI stopped meditation cause I couldn't see much benefit in it. To start off with I'm already a very calm and relaxed person. I imagine for a stressed out person meditation would be very useful. I find it's better to eliminate the stress rather than to use meditation to help you relax from the stress. Caffeine causes more stress to a person's life than anything else. All I did was eliminate coffee and it felt like I instantly went into a deep sense of calm in my daily life. I didn't even have to meditate anymore. If I drink coffee then I have to meditate to calm down from the caffeine. Most people don't even know this about caffeine. Your whole should be a meditation not just 40mins a day. It's a good effort but for me it was not necessary. I was just doing it cause I thought everyone recommends it. Listen to your own intuition and do whatever the hell you want but please remove or dramatically lesson all stimulants in your life\n\nSure, external approaches to solving stress can be almost as effective as internal ones (ie meditation), and stimulants in particular are very damaging to mental stability. \n\nBut calming yourself is only the beginning of what you can do with meditation. The originating traditions of the practice use calming yourself with meditation primarily as a setup step, to make understanding and manipulating your own mind easier to do.\n\nFor instance, I‚Äôve found designing symbols/mantras based on the insights meditation &amp; psychology provide, and then using them as focuses of attention, is very effective in training your subconscious to use better approaches for specific tasks. Where ‚Äútasks‚Äù can be as broad as ‚Äútask-switching‚Äù, ‚Äúsituational awareness‚Äù, or ‚Äúpredicting long-term consequences‚Äù. It‚Äôs helped me a lot with eg doing my work more efficiently and not getting overwhelmed / needing help in high-task-volume periods.\n\nAs another example, I doubt I‚Äôd have managed to counteract my natural attentional problems without enhanced focus/attentional-control, which almost every type/path of meditation provides both immediately after a sit and in the long term from consistent practice.\n\nThanks for your comment. Also I couldn't find a technique that put me into something blissful.\nTo be honest it was too much effort also. Just lying outside in the sun is the most relaxing thing for me. Sitting there trying to focus on a mantra or symbol is effort. It's work. \nI don't need meditation. I go through my life differently to most people. I'm never in a rush and I'm always in the moment, happy and peaceful. People around me are stressed but not me. I was trying to do meditation not to relax but to reach higher consciousness where I could manifest my desires easily.\n\nMantras (and other forms of directly shaping parts of your mind) don‚Äôt really feel like work once you get into it, more like a flow state. \n\nI think any instance of learning to reach a different state of consciousness than your ‚Äúnormal‚Äù will feel like work at first, though, because you‚Äôre diverging from your ingrained mental habits. The ease comes *after* your brain has been trained to easily follow the new patterns (or once you‚Äôve trained your attentional control and introspective clarity enough to directly surpass the hardship through precise direction of awareness).\n\nPS: Jhanas are one of the few exceptions to the above difficulty for many (though not everyone), if you‚Äôre interested in feeling supernormal bliss and willing to go to a Theravada retreat to be properly supervised during the process.\n\nPersonally, once I saw the underlying principle they‚Äôre meant to teach (which it seems you‚Äôve also apprehended), seeking out the jhanas themselves was never of interest (I‚Äôve had to actively reject Jhana 1 creeping up on me in daily life), but most differ in that regard.\n\nWhy do you meditate anyway? Kids don't meditate and they're perfectly blissful and so am  I. The way I live my life is a meditation I guess.\nGive me a very simple powerful technique. I've tried various techniques for a couple of years.\nQuitting caffeine gave me more benefits than hours of meditation\n\n&gt; Why do you meditate\n\nI do it to improve my ability to focus and ingrain mental habits that I think are useful. For productivity, basically. Definitely helps that I‚Äôve also strongly avoided substances like caffeine and alcohol, so I have that initial base of effectiveness to build upon further through meditative practice.\n\nAs for bliss, once you‚Äôve gotten past the initial blockers against it (via meditation/therapy/whatever), bliss and contentment are within reach by simply living your life meditatively (as you suggest), so seeking it out at that stage isn‚Äôt really necessary unless you want to.\n\n&gt; Give me a very simple powerful technique\n\nHere‚Äôs a 3-part meditative practice I use often for learning, insight, and productivity.\n\nPart 1:\n\nAfter you‚Äôve completed some project, enter a state of light mindfulness (which increases memory and self-awareness of cognitive biases). Work through your memories of your actions and experiences during the time of this project, going backwards from the ending and paying particular attention to actions/events you noted as important during this time period.  \n\nFor each of these, consider what causal relationship they had to the final outcome. Once you‚Äôve reached the beginning of the project, go to the end again and explore the causal links you noticed however you feel is right. At each point you explore in the causal network, consider how counterfactual values at that point could have changed the outcome.\n\nPart 2:\n\nBased on multiple instances of the above on projects in the same domain, you will have collected an intuition for how you make decisions in this domain-context, what kinds of events outside your control do or could happen, and how both of those influence outcomes. Think (not necessarily meditate, though again, states of light mindfulness can enhance cognitive function) about what your decision process generally is and what attentional patterns precede your decisions; look for cases where allocating your attention differently may make you more effective.\n\nAfter converging on an idea from the above, and thinking through it further to ensure it doesn‚Äôt have any costs to effectiveness or life experience, figure out a mantra that represents that mentality/shift-in-mentality. Personally I look for single words that I can tie in my mind to mean the relevant concept, since I‚Äôm usually ingraining multiple interconnected ideas at once, but this is entirely a personal preference. \n\nPart 3:\n\nNow for the mantra meditation part. First, focus on linking the mantra you selected with the attentional states/shifts you are ascribing to it. This might take a bit when you‚Äôre new to the practice, but quickly drops in time required.\n\nSecond, meditate by centering your focus on this mantra. Your focus should start on the mantra as a phrase/word (*not* as a sound or vocalization, as is the case with mantras like ‚Äúom‚Äù) and then be allowed to shift to the meaning you‚Äôve attached to it. Continue focusing your attention on that meaning until you feel it is solidly present in your mind, but not ingrained deeply (the latter works, but is annoying to undo if you improve the ‚Äúprogram‚Äù of your mantra). \n\nNow the mentality you selected is sufficiently present in your subconscious that it will shift how your attention is allocated while acting. This works even if you don‚Äôt focus on the mantra, but if you want to enhance the effect at a particular moment, you can bring the mantra to mind for a bit to strengthen its effects.\n\nThe effect of the above meditation will naturally fade or change the shape of the impressed mentality with time. You will need to either focus on the intention to discard this mantra and unlink it with the associated perspective (to get rid of the connection), reinforce the mantra with another session of meditation (allowing the effect to continue, and if repeated many times for the same mantra ingraining the mentality as an option your subconscious can take even if you cease to reinforce it later), or modify the perspective attached to this mantra and meditate on the new perspective (if the perspectives are sufficiently conflicting this may not succeed, in which case you need to explicitly remove the previous meaning first).\n\nAppreciate all that. Really do but very complicated. I think I'll just close my eyes and feel the warmth of the sun outside. Peace\n\nHeadspace makes meditation fun for me! I like checking off the lists üòÇ\n\nHappy international day of Yoga üôèüèΩ\n\nCurious how you break up your time? Do you do 20 min in the morning and 20 min at night? Like an opener/closer for each day?\n\nYes that‚Äôs how I started: 20 minutes in the morning and 20 min before bed. But I‚Äôm now experimenting with 15 in the morning, 10 in the afternoon and 15 at night\n\nüëè congratulations! it's hard to make meditation  a routine, but you did it! And of course  I don't really think we need to make it a routine, but learning its spirit  is  very useful in your daily life!\n\nWell done. Personally ,I have found the greatest help in my meditation practice came from reading RJ Spina's book Supercharged Self Healing. There are so many quick mindset tricks like No past, no future just present that has changed the way I meditate. \nKeep going, Get RUINED.\n\nI didn't read all the comments.  Meditation is a Practice!  It's preparation for the approaching journey to the non-physical side of our being. I‚Äôm writing because you tried to ride a bolder uphill.  That took courage and determination. You can sit for 8 hours a day in meditation but if you have missed the authentic purpose for meditation, the result is total frustration but feeling ‚Äúpeacefully‚Äù frustrated.  You are a Micro God like the rest of humanity but currently asleep. Meditation is designed to be a seamless return to the Macro God. But you must have the necessary teacher and passion.  If either are missing, the math won‚Äôt work.  Go see Sant Rajinder Singh Ji Maharaj and use you determination wisely.  Kindest regards. üôèüèæüëâüèæüßòüèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüßòüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüîë\n\nI did two a days for years during my twenties.  I think it allowed me to grow as much as I did.  Also, I was so busy, I did not sleep enough, and meditation helped keep me okay.\n\nI agree with everything you wrote.  What I said back then was it helped integrate me into my environment.  I became better engaged, and interacted with everything better.\n\nThe discipline became commitment, like people have who are disciplined with working out.\n\nGood post there.\n\nDid you find significantly more depth when you upped to 2x20 mins?\n\nI've been meditating once a day for 15 mins for about a year. I struggle to find the time for more but wondering if I should make time for it\n\nYes, for me 2x20 min is much more beneficial than 1x15 min (did that before). Not only because of the meditation itself, but also because meditating more often and longer makes me more conscious throughout the day. So now I also often do a short or longer breathing exercise in the afternoon, just because it feels like a natural thing to do\n\n&gt;Meditation makes you less reactive to your environment.¬†With a consistent practice you'll be able to keep your focus and energy to yourself. As a result, things that happen outside your control no longer have such an impact on you.\n\nNice. By becoming less reactive, you empower yourself to navigate life‚Äôs challenges with grace and resilience.\n\nHow do you motivate yourself to meditate even when you dread it and don‚Äôt want to do it?\n\nJust do it, there is no other way. While meditating you‚Äôll remember why it‚Äôs so good for you.¬†\n\nSame with eating healthy and exercise for me üòé\n\nPut yourself on the cushion (or whatever), even just for a minute.\n\nEveryone can sit for a minute.\n\nThe habit becomes established and it becomes effortless.\n\nFor me it's like getting into the shower. I know I need a shower, but I keep putting it off, I'm glad I do it in the end.\n\nIf there's a way for you to approach your sittings with curiosity that helps a lot. I'll often take things Ive learned here and bring them to my next meditation.\n\nPractice and learning to tune in to the subtle benefits after; it's reached a point where I find the opportunities delicious and  am thrilled when I have spare minutes to give to it. And yes, I used to avoid it and was \"too restless to meditate,\" for a lot of my life.\n\nInterestingly (and a bit ironically), the best way to learn about this is to meditate and observe, not identify with or judge, your inner responses.\n\n Meditation is to thinking what walking is to running.\n\nRoutine is everything, 90+ days and going strong üí™, never missed 1 day, every day 15 (morning) + 5 (night)\n\nThis post gives me AI vibes.\n\nHahaha - English is not my native language so Google Translate helped me a bit\n\nAI is a better translator imo ;)\n\nüò≠üòÇ\n\nNo disrespect but meditating 40 minutes a day for 30 days is not that much and does not make you an expert. There's a lot to discover on a meditation journey, and if you keep going, everything you mention in the post may change.\n\nNever said I was an expert! Just wanted to share how a relative short period of consistent meditation can already have huge benefits, hoping it would stimulate people to start making it a habit also\n\nI had a session once where I lost contact, I saw the universe speeding away, they couldn‚Äôt wake me up\n\nWhen I used to meditate I would woke up. Now reading posts like this(I didn‚Äôt read it all) it just gives me false hope."

It also helps with motivation since the pain of starting something is more easily overcome.\n\nCan you say more about the negative emotional response from starting something?\n\nI think they were two separate things, meditation helping develop part of your brain which then assists in your ability to balance out negative feelings, and then the second being a meditation practice can help make starting tasks less daunting, just from the habit of starting the task of meditating and it being so simple to start, I believe that‚Äôs what they mean anyway, hope this makes sense!\n\nI really enjoyed this book as I am a creative person with ADHD and I had a problem with procrastination. He talks about \"the resistance\" which is what I view as the total sum of negative emotional responses.\n\n[https://www.amazon.ca/War-Art-Through-Creative-Battles/dp/1936891026](https://www.amazon.ca/War-Art-Through-Creative-Battles/dp/1936891026)\n\nI am having a hard time dealing with procrastination. No matter how many times, I decide that I will start studying well before exams and understand it thoroughly, each time my adhd kicks in, I procrastinate, deadlines come closer, I panic and it triggers my anxiety and then I can't study properly and mess up my grades like each time.\n\nI will surely read the book hoping to get answers about my habit of procrastination. It would be really helpful if you tell me how to deal with procrastination.\n\nCool!!\n\nThis is really cool, do you happen to have a source for the research at hand?\n\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7381101/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7381101/)\n\ncheck out this paper\n\nYou just made my life. Thanks!\n\nUsername checks out\n\nSuper interesting\n\n&gt;Meditation develops...\n\nAny specific form of meditation or any form?\n\nUsually mindfulness meditation is recognized as the most cognitively beneficial\n\nThanks!\n\nDoing things you don't want to do also develops the AMCc, I was doing cold showers every day when I was going through a rough patch in my life. I also went on long walks listening to Eckhart Tolle's Power of Now audiobook. I honestly think that's just as good as traditional meditation.\n\nAs someone with pretty severe adhd, as well as autism, I have not found I‚Äôve been able to reduce my executive dysfunction with meditation lol However, I feel like a huge part of living with a different brain than the type society is designed around is the self-shaming, negative self talk and the social awkwardness. Meditation has helped immensely with awareness of those thoughts and that‚Äôs what‚Äôs given me a lot of compassion and patience for myself, which in turn has helped with the executive dysfunction because I‚Äôm not going down a shame spiral over a task anymore\n\nYes! This! So very much this! \n\nAs a fellow AuDHD, I can totally relate and love how you phrased this. Thank you and well done!\n\nThis is very impressive well done!\n\nThank you! That means a lot!\n\nCrazy how unaware we are over how we speak to ourselves and how bad it can be.\n\nThat‚Äôs wonderful! I‚Äôm so happy for you. I have experience with self shaming and becoming aware of it to reduce it. It‚Äôs a very difficult thing to experience and unravel.\n\nThis is so great and on point on how meditation makes us happier ‚ù§Ô∏è\nI can get pretty anxious and I‚Äôm a severe people pleaser. Meditation gives me the patience you were mentioning and makes me feel free. Have you tried Buddhism?\n\nI also have ADHD and I‚Äôve had a lot of trouble sitting still and clearing my mind long enough to sit and meditate. While I don‚Äôt want to encourage substance use too much, I found that marijuana edibles were great at providing me with a meditative-esque state. I was able to sit still close my eyes and just explore my mind, feel my emotions, my body parts, add certain music in to the mix and I was able to introspect and ground myself more. Again don‚Äôt want to encourage substance use, but anecdotally I think the substance could be good for facilitating meditation in people with adhd. Just a thought though.\n\nThanks for your comment! I have also found weed helps a lot haha sometimes it‚Äôll give me the same feelings that psychedelics will in that I feel loving compassion and patience for everything. I use sativas in place of adderall as well as I find it‚Äôs a more mellow stimulant to even the lowest doses of pharmaceuticals\n\nKeep doing it! Eventually your situation will change again and you will begin doubting yourself again. Even the practise might seem useless again. Just remind yourself of what you did before. Which is I think something like this. Following emotions swings you around but focussing attention makes your experience more centered.\n\nYou have these thought processes and emotions that take away your attention and figuratively paint your reality in their colour (bleak and depressive). There is too much attention on them and by meditating and shifting your focus you are allowing yourself to relax in those moments. \n\nNow your attention is where *specifically you* want it. By simply taking the pressure off the anxiety it's taking care of itself. And preferably your attention is in the here and now with what's in front of you, like getting tattoos and making phone calls or punching the PM.\n\n[deleted]\n\nUugghh yes I struggle with the consistency. Yoga and meditation always have such hugely positive impacts on my life, so WHY is it so hard to keep the routine going??üò©\n\nI feel like this with a lot of my self care routine/fitness training and sensible eating... these things are good for me!! Cmon brain!!! üôàü§£\n\nomg same! i feel the same way about running, but i keep falling off every few weeks. Actually i know my reason tho, it‚Äôs mostly cuz it tires me out too much and i feel like i spend way too much time recovering by sleeping and eating and don‚Äôt get much else done lol\n\nStep 1 : Meditate\n\nStep 2 : Assault head of state\n\nStep 3 : ???\n\nStep 4 : Profit.\n\nThat would relieve the stress of everyone in the country, believe me.\n\nRishi does have a punchable face. ü§£\n\n[removed]\n\nWe do not allow self posts with links from new members.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Meditation) if you have any questions or concerns.*\n\n*head of government\n\nAs a Canadian, I appreciate this.\n\nI got, and continue to get, similar results.  Absolute life changer.  Keep going with it. I've been doing it consistently for 15 years now, and after an initial experience like yours, it keeps bestowing new gifts.\n\nDamn this reminds me I gotta get back to a daily practice. I know the benefits are huge and it‚Äôs not even that hard to do but it‚Äôs so easy to slip üòì\n\nHappy for you.  Congratulations.   And on a side note, I‚Äôve got a new favorite phrase: ‚ÄúI feel so good I could punch a prime minister!‚Äù  (Of course, as an American, I‚Äôm gonna have to stretch to find ways to use it)\n\nHow exactly do you go about meditating? What do you follow and for how long\n\nI think it may be too early to discern whether the effects are wishful thinking or genuine benefits of meditation.\n\nIf you‚Äôre like me, I get so excited about a new activity/habit that I convince myself of their usefulness within the first couple days.\n\nThe effects of meditation are profound but having such a liberating sensation only days after you start sounds a bit too good to be true in my opinion.\n\nBUT at least you've made it fun and are enjoying it! That alone means you'll be more likely to do it. That's a win even if the effects are placebo for the time being.\n\nI absolutely adore this for you. Meditation is such a boon for deep healing and integrating all the parts of ourselves that may have been neglected.\n\nI feel the same! Started meditating about a week ago and I'm just blown away by how effective it is! My anxiety had been absolutely crippling for as long as I can remember, even simple day to day tasks would often feel monumentally difficult. I'd put off the idea of meditation simply because I really didn't think it would do anything for me and it's wonderful to be proven wrong. So glad it's had such a profound effect on you too OP üôÇ onwards and upwards!\n\nI love reading how people are taking back their power with meditation. Very happy for you!\n\nThank you üòä\n\nWhy can I never experience this level of freedom no matter how often I meditate? I have MS (Multiple Sclerosis), and‚Ä¶I feel as if it‚Äôs my MS that blocks me from feeling this level of freedom?\n\nIs it not true that, not everyone gets the benefits of meditation, no matter how often they meditate?\n\nThere seem to be many different types of meditation out there, and maybe some of them benefit different people.  I was actually just mulling this over.  I have a son that I really want to help and have been trying to figure it all out.  He has charcot marie tooth disease (neurodegenerative but it's genetic and thankfully very slow progression), and also anxiety and and an autism dx as well.  I feel like the breathing meditation this person describes helps with calming but I think for things like intrusive thoughts this may not be enough\n\nHave you ever tried any of the guided meditation apps? Some have a very extensive library with meditations specifically designed for anxiety, pain, health anxiety etc etc etc Perhaps he can find something there that help. I tried a few and found my personal favorite, but everyone‚Äôs different.\n\nNo unfortunately i am skeptical about those for him because he has a hard time taking in auditory.  It wouldn't hurt to try and maybe i will but just explaining why i didn't turn to those first\n\nI believe you and have resisted starting despite being encouraged by therapists for years. \n\nI've tried  to meditate but I got Chris Tucker screaming in my head.\n\nHow long have you been meditating for?¬†\n\n[deleted]\n\nActually I have just now started 'researching' about meditation...¬†\nCan you please help me out a bit? I am really having trouble finding resources. Is it simply just sitting down and focusing on my breath?¬†\n\nThis is a good starting place for focusing on the breath.   I have been basically doing this every day for 4 months and feel many benefits. \nhttps://www.do-meditation.com/samatha-meditation.html\n\nThese are literally  my 2 biggest challenges  in life. Okay I've been procrastinating for over 5 years after reading about meditation yet I seem to be phhchologically blocked from starting....\n\ndude this is amazing and you have inspired me to atleast try!\n\nI still don‚Äôt really understand how focusing on your breath would lead to such a drastic change. I actually would think that it would intensify the social anxiety, because you‚Äôre already like hyper aware of everything.\n\nIt is AMAZING isn‚Äôt it? And the best thing about it is that it doesn‚Äôt have to be perfect to be worthwhile. Namaste. Carpe Diem!\n\nMeditating and spending time in mindfulness practices help you visualize your goals, overcome limiting beliefs, and regulate your nervous system. There is a lot of negative noise in the world I am glad you can share your journey and the impact that meditation has had on your life. I've been mediating for over a decade, it has truly changed my life. Congrats on your journey.\n\nGood for you!.\n\nSame.  Glad you found it\n\nSo happy for you :]\n\nSame my friend, you love to see it. I keep seeing people with the same results. Here's to a less anxious world. I really believe our homeless population and many people suffer alone with anxiety either without knowing how bad it is and not showing symptoms to all the people they interact with. Glad to hear you've made it so far.\n\nQuit caffeine for very deep clear meditation and life\n\nNight and day change that's only a few days old and makes you feel like a million bucks? You're hypomanic. How's your sleep?\n\nI don't know why I stopped meditating.'' seeing that it helped you, well I guess that's my cue to not stop meditating üòä\n\nHow long do you meditate for in the morning and evening?\n\n[deleted]\n\nCongratulations on the great start to your practise.\n\nHow long do you meditate in the morning, like 10min?\n\nMeditation has helped me get in touch with my true self in a deeper way than literally my entire life\n\nHow long do you meditate\n\n[deleted]\n\nHow long did it take to see changes? For three weeks I meditated for over an hour but i guess that got way too because I fell out of the habit.\n\nHow long have you been meditating?\n\n[deleted]\n\nGlad to see you‚Äôre getting such good results so soon. I need to get back on the horse.\n\nWishing you many more small and big wins, don't stop ever, god bless.\n\nHow long do you meditate for\n\nThat last line üíØ\n\nJesus im trying but im so envious when people post here saying how much meditation changed their life, last day i did 3 sessions of 30 min each through the day and didnt notice a thing ;(\n\nIm having a hard time rn (suicidal thoughts) the thing is, im not so constant, i dont have a strict meditation routine. I will try to do it like you said, one time when i wake up and another just before bed\n\nHow much time do you do it per session ?\n\nIs it best to meditate on a gym mat or is carpet fine?\n\nhow do you meditate?\n\nI love seeing stories like this. I also used meditation to cure me of work anxiety. Kudos to you friend!\n\nHahahaha love it. Thank u I‚Äôm going to do this tonite\n\nBRB, I‚Äôm gonna work on trying to be on your level. I want to feel thatüò≠ I want to punch someone in the faceüò≠ lol jk but honestly, I would love to feel anything other than anxiety for once.\n\nHow long do you meditate for?\n\nHow long did you meditate for?\n\nSo encouraging! thanks for the share!\n\nI have tried meditation.  It is so hard for me to clear my mind .  Any suggestions?\n\nThat sounds so good that makes me wanna punch a prime minister to feel how great it is.\n\nFor anyone finding it difficult to slow thoughts down while meditating, journaling a few minutes before is very helpful. I pick up a blank piece of paper and go for it. I pour all my thoughts out, and then I begin my session. My mind is clear, and I can better silence my thoughts during my session. Meditation is a practice, and it takes a little time to get it right. But when you do, it's so worth it.\n\nCan someone share any good guided meditation link ? Just beginning with this\n\nHow do you actually meditate? i don‚Äôt understand. I tried but I‚Äôm thinking and talking in my mind.\n\nI took a sleep course and this was something the doctor recommended listening to everyday day. It‚Äôs a guided relaxation audio https://open.spotify.com/track/6WLTUXUureUXNeYJIyLPIG?si=vvbBl1O8SqKBMm93KVxaSw\n\nIs sleeping meditating?\n\nNo. This is a guided meditation that supposed to help relaxed the body. It walks you through breathing and also going through your body parts. Since you do not know how to meditate this is not a bad place to start.\n\nHey, any tips on how to not get distracted during meditation and staying in it?\n\nI keep starting and stopping meditation. Reading other peoples experiences are what motivates me to start meditating again. Your experience is so promising because I also have social anxiety and executive dysfunction so this has motivated me x100 to start meditation again. I hope you continue to have good results\n\nthis is true.. Meditation does do wonders.. I've been practicing it for months now.. i can finally feel the change.. im more patient and calm.. despite my chaotic surroundings and pressures of life.. I'm even making an effort to spread the word .. via videos and blogs.. it really helps but one needs to patient .. it takes time but the results are really surprising. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxAc4kN-NAc&amp;t=1s&amp;ab\\_channel=ConradD%27souza](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxAc4kN-NAc&amp;t=1s&amp;ab_channel=ConradD%27souza)\n\n&gt;I feel like I could punch the prime minister.\n\nI fucking howled at this. Came out of nowhere.\n\nIt hasn‚Äôt done a lot for me to be honest. But I am over the point of being excited when starting a new habit. Especially after seeing so many people claim its benefits, I can easily trip myself up to wishful thinking. And I don‚Äôt understand what the hell focusing on certain body parts mean? Like wtf? Does it mean you feel tingles in that certain body part? My mind does not make a difference in behavior when ‚Äúfocusing‚Äù\n\nThat last part came out of nowhere and I laughed out loud so hard üòÇ\n\nMeditation is one way to take back ownership of ATTENTION, which is perhaps the most valuable asset we have. Letting our attention run wild is what gets us into trouble. So yeah, pay attention to your attention, is one of my aphorisms\n\nMeditation is beautiful feeling\n\nInstead of sitting to meditate as if it is a separate life activity, why not turn everything you do every day into meditation? How to BlissFlip? Ask me questions.\n\nHow's it going so far? Effects still standing or no?\n\n[deleted]\n\nThanks for the response, I'm going to incorporate this to fight my executive dysfunction\n\n[removed]\n\nI am glad to hear that meditation is helping you a lot.\n\nI have also noticed similar changes with meditation practice.\n\nYes, meditation really is a powerful tool for managing anxiety.\n\nHave you found any particular meditation techniques that seem to help you the most.\n\n&gt;&gt; I feel like I could punch the prime minister.\n\nManic episode? Please be careful\n\nHonestly that last comment made me laugh out loud for the first time this week, so thank you. \nAnd massive congrats on your efforts and results, it's inspired me to start again :)\n\nYou are doing a meditation which is used in a very similar way in therapy. It is there to calm you down and as a support to handle difficult emotions.\nIt is also a skill for a very high stress level in DBT, which is a awareness-based therapy for people who have  PTSD or Borderline.\n\nI also think that you could send your body the signal that you are safe and you can relax now. I had social axiety too and it was because I was living in an abusive household. I wasn't feeling safe and was projecting this to people in general (it wasn't a conscious decision)\n\nAnd there is a chance that you are releasing the trauma which gets stored in the body with bringing awareness to it. Maybe there are 'random' sensations, feelings or thoughts coming up during your practise. This could be a sign that your body and subconsciousness work through trauma with you üòä\n\nI didn't think it was possible that social axiety disappears so quick and I'm very happy for you! ‚ò∫\n\nHey how are you feeling now\n\nDid not understand assignment; executive function required to overcome executive dysfunction üò≠üò≠üò≠ either I just flat out forget, or the moment needs to be just right. I want to be better but starting the start is so out of reach\n\nDamn I should try meditation more seriously this time cause my anxiety can sometimes be out of control.\n\nYes meditation.   Calm app makes it soo easy !  Always was so deep and skilled,  didn't stick with it\n  NOW,  just a 7 to 10 minutes before I get up in the morning is soo helpful.\n\nThis is the true teaching of the Bible and every other religion. All the NPCs have been indoctrinated for greed and war. I have proof. Go to YouTube and search William Donahue. This dude is beyond intelligent on this subject. Blew my mind and finally gave me peace.\n\nDon‚Äôt ruin your body with a tattoo, all the rest is good stuff though.\n\nDon't get a tattoo\n\nMost pretentious as phuck post I've read till this day...\n\n:(\n\nI am sorry üòî, I didn't mean that...."

    "title": "2 years of daily meditation - here's what I learned\n",
    "body": "Edit***\n\nSorry guys a lot of you been asking, I'm doing today mantra focused meditation \nWith each inhale i say a mantra\nAnd with each exhale\nThat what works for me the best\nKeeping my attention on my breath with the\nMantra.\nI don't know the prof name haha\n\nPost:\n\nHello guys! hope you had a great year.\n\nMy last post last year of 1-year meditation got a lot of engagement and a lot of people talked with me about it in the comment section and in private messages.\n\nSo now I'm making the 2nd year post of my daily meditation.\n\nhere's a small recap from last year:\n\nI started meditating for 5 minutes each day for a week two years ago.\n\nIt quickly became 10,15,20,30min and sometimes 1 hour.\n\nAt that time, I had just had one of the hardest break-ups of my life.  \nI couldn't cope with all the emotions I've felt, the good and the bad so I decided to give meditation a try just for the sake of it without knowing it would change all my thinking patterns.\n\nSo, I started meditating, each day for 5 minutes at a time because I wanted it to become a daily habit so I started slowly till' I got used to it. I was a bartender at a late-night bar at that time, so when there were days I did not do my meditation all day I just did it before work in the bathroom, or at peak hour, just to mark that I had committed to do it every day for 5 minutes.\n\nI began understanding more and more about myself, and my needs.  \nSo here's a new list of the things that have changed on the way from 2 years of daily mediation:\n\n1. I can enter an awareness state a lot faster, while doing anything like working, etc.\n2. I'm not interested anymore in conversations like gossip type.\n3. I don't have anxiety anymore. And if I have a bad day it can just change by being aware of my needs or recording myself talking to the camera about anything. like a diary.\n4. Stopped consuming alcohol for 1 year 3 months and going, And I'm a bartender.\n5. Found the woman of my dreams, 5 months ago, dating and living together since 2nd month, with no drama, no ego, no fighting, and she started practicing meditation with me, she stopped smoking weed after 3 years of smoking every day.\n6. I started a podcast about self-improvement (In Hebrew), and overall my communication skills became amazing. mostly cause I became a better listener. \n7. Gained a huge amount of muscle mass since last year.\n8. Memory is sharper than ever, and cognitive functions also.\n9. Sex is better than ever, I can be aware mid-act of my breath and sensations.  \n10. Everyone new that I meet always loves my good energy.\n11. I don't masturbate anymore and If I do it's really rare and only from imagination\n12. I stopped trying to tell everyone they have to meditate, It happened last year but I understood that every person is different, and each one has his journey.\n13. My psychiatrist cut 1 of the medicines I've been taking Since 2016 when I had manic episodes and was diagnosed bipolar, So I was taking 250mg of valproic acid and 5mg of zyprexa olanzapine, and now only 5mg and soon nothing, this is one of my biggest moments in my life. Of course, I don't have any more manic or depressive events, I just live my life happy and meditative:)\n14. No toxic people anymore In my life. Only the ones I love and there aren't many haha\n15. I notice a huge increase in people using their phones on social media, on dates, and on friendly occasions, and I think the biggest problem is we're living on autopilot, Instead, we should listen when others speak, ask them questions, and be interested in what they say, especially in a relationship. we should notice the road on the train to work, and just enjoy the small moments instead of chasing our problems in our head, what matters is now.\n\nToday my meditation is usually around 20-40 min first thing in the morning, on the train to work maybe also some 15 min, and sometimes 10 min before bed.\n\nI have a lot more to tell I'm sure, but I'll leave it to you to understand by yourself.  \nIt is important to say Meditation Is not going to fix your problems, I had a lot of bad moments this year also, but I kept my practice, Kept working out, and kept following my dreams. I kept searching for myself to become better. And If you're better with yourself, you gonna be better for everyone surrounds you.\n\nI can say today, that I trust my intuition a lot more and this year will be a one to remember for me.  \nThis is a habit for life.\n\nThank you for reading :)",

    "all_comment_text": "I started sitting in my teens and I'm 64 now.  Most people don't appreciate the satisfaction that comes from just being for 30-40 minutes each day.  It seems boring at first.  But when you get past that, you realize how big each moment is.  Keep going! You are definitely on to something..\n\nSo right‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nHey if you don't mind me asking I have a few questions, for context I am 19 years old and have been meditating on and off since last year, also like to call myself a curious ponderer or something like that lmao\n\nHow has life been since your teens? especially interacting with other people your age and also older people(i notice myself correcting people alot when they're wrong, especially with older people it's weird because they take it personally as if I've said something blasphemous, but other than that interacting with people as an empathetic person has been fun I'd say)\n(Btw could you give me an extensive answer to \"how has your life been\", like have you achieved everything you set out to do ? Have you been happy the whole time ? All of that)\n\nDo you think you've had no regrets after you've started meditating?(In my case I started meditating to give myself some peace, I did not like not knowing why I acted the way I did/not being self aware enough, and meditation has really helped me step back and learn more about myself and people in general, atp I feel i understand alot but I also know that there's alot I might not understand and will learn in the future, so idk if I'll have regrets in the future or not)\n\nWas it a challenge for you to come to acceptance with the fact that there is literally nothing to worry/stress about in the present moment ?(This has been the only problem for me after I've started meditating, since I've been so used to being stressed about something or the other all the time, it's weird to see myself not stressing, but I'd say I've been getting better at it the past few months, still not \"there\" yet though)\n\nIn one word, my life has been 'acceptable'. That is, I've come to accept it.  That's all that really matters.\n\nit‚Äôs the ‚Äúi don‚Äôt mind‚Äù sentiment.. u/altacc567.   \n\nas it‚Äôs said and experienced by many- as one deepens their practice, a person begins to see life as a gift full of experiences that are not bound to any sense of expectations‚Ä¶ ‚Äúi do X for Y‚Äù vs ‚Äúi do X and will be open to whatever‚Äù.  \n\none develops more discernment and intention vs becoming a person pulled in every direction.  \n\nlove the idea that you are curious at this age in you life as this type of curiosity for many comes later in life either on one‚Äôs own or via a life experience that can ‚Äúwake‚Äù a person up.  \n\nkeep on being curious and lastly always work on being kind to yourself first. after we really learn to love ourselves we can be kind and loving to others.  \n\nw/ joy and gratitude:)\n\nReally well said\n\nThat makes alot of sense. Thank you PookiePookie26ü•∫\n\nDamn that's deep\n\nI don't think there is no there to get to. It is a practice.  And life gets better.\n\nYes.\n\nCan you text me please.\n\nFor every post like this, there are so many more of us who have done the same and experienced the same growth. No one is immune. Meditation makes time for you to be who you are. All boats rise together. By the time I was at 2 years I realized I don't meditate for me, I meditate for the world.\n\nLove your experience and your take on this.\n\nAwesome journey, keep it up. I can agree with the benefits of meditation but I just have a 150 day streak, not like you with 2 years. Awesome !!\n\nI feel very seen reading this. \nSometimes I feel like I live in a different Matrix/reality when I see people in public staring into their screens wherever they go. Completely detached from what is going on around them. \n\nEven when there is an interaction with a stranger, most of the time there is a subtle discomfort and disconnect. No or only a short look into each others eyes. \n\nI will say that I experienced some positive encounters. When I stayed connected to my heart and would radiate that warmth outward, sometimes I get a smile back. Not that I expect it but it‚Äôs always a pleasant surprise.\n\nYes man, excactly\n\nBro idk where you live but it sounds depressing. There are many great cultures with fantastic people and communities. Go on an adventure and find an amazing place to live with amazing people\n\nThank you for sharing. Currently I‚Äôm 53 days in to a daily practice. I relate a lot with how you started. Horrible break up, hard to sit with my feelings. Started small and with guided meditations and now minimum of 15 mins. But typically 25-30 mins. Starting to notice significant perspective shifts, my inner voice has changed drastically. Acceptance of everything comes almost naturally. And my favorite part, just being able to sit with myself and just be. I hope to be able to post about my one year daily journey one day as well!\n\nWhat guided meditation are you using?\n\nCurrently none. Just concentration meditation. As I was learning, I used Waking Up. Did his beginners course and then just used several out of their catalogue. Really enjoyed their metta series.\n\nI started 3 days ago. Still going. Any tips to stay consistent? (I just found this subreddit)\n\nStart small bro and add it to your sceduale, im sure you can do 5 min everday for a week!\nAfter 1 week do 8 \nThen 10 \nAnd you will get used to this habit\n\nAgree with the other commenter. Staying consistent is important. Part of my journey is to keep my commitments to myself. Some days it‚Äôs in the car before I go to work. Other days it‚Äôs seated at home for 30 minutes.\n\nThat‚Äôs so awesome!!! Congratulations, sounds like you‚Äôre on the right track.¬†\n\nThank you‚ù§Ô∏è\n\noh wow this is so wholesome, it‚Äôs really giving me hopeü©µ thanks for sharing!\n\n‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nthank you for sharing =)\n\nLove this üíö\n\n‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nThank you for the encouragement\n\nHey congrats this is awesome! I‚Äôm also a bartender and this gives me the motivation to keep trying\n\nYess bro! Good luck‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nWell done, keep it up\n\nHey! Just here to see what your conditioning is.\n\nExpand on number 2! I'm curious. \nWhat do you see when someone wants to gossip about someone else? Do you not like it? \nCould you engage in such conversations naturally? If not, why not?\n\nI feel like meditation increases empathy and helps you see things for what they really are.\nInstead of getting carried away in the gossip, you might start noticing things about the person telling you the gossip. You might be able to sense certain insecurities, issues, thoughts that the person in front of you has for them to participate in the gossip. Atleast this is what changed for me.\n\nI've noticed the same that they are mentioning: I can participate in gossip, but I choose not to. I find my own opinion on something not needed unless asked, whereas before I would supply my opinion without warrant or guardrails.¬†\n\n\nI do like making people laugh, so I do sarcastically engage in my own forms of banter and gossip. My opinion, my joke.¬†\n\n\nMy main point is that people (in the office, for me) have gossip that I'm not interested in, so I have nothing to say because I don't have a feeling of needing approval. That neediness has lessened as time has gone on with meditation and learning more intuitively about myself.¬†\n\nWould you say that you are a lot happier now than when you first started meditating?\n\nLike 10x more\n\nThanks you for sharing.\n\nThank you for reading‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nThank you for sharing.   \nWishing you all the best and look forward to next years update\n\nThank you‚ù§Ô∏è\n\n[deleted]\n\nFor those who are serious about developing a daily practice, I highly recommend The Mind Illuminated. It‚Äôs available as a [free pdf download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16pKrr74_4bnYc6GqQeScou9riGhxtst4/view). There‚Äôs also a sub: r/TheMindIlluminated\n\nI'm buzzing for you bro\n\n‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nYou have inspired me!\n\nReally happy to hear it‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nThis is a typical response to meditation as far as its benefits. I do recommend it for everyone.\n\nThe withdrawals of cutting some of those meds suck!  The meditation will definitely help though!\n\nFor sure!\n\n[deleted]\n\nStart really small my friend\nLike 2-5 min each day for a week\nThen raise it by 2 min \nThen another week\nExc.\n\nThink of it like a workout, start small and you'll get better at lifting those weights\n\nWeird question but does excessive meditation cause you to feel depersonalised ?\n\nYes at first, now used to it\nI'm just present\n\nWhat‚Äôs your goal for next year?\n\nI guess lower my screen time, and to become\nMore calm then today\n\nwhar kind of resources did you learn from, any specific you can point to?\n\nI guess it's really just trial and error for me\n\nOP,\n\nCan I please message you?\n\nI have few doubts to ask you.\n\nFor sure!\n\nDid you read any books in particular that helped you find the style of meditation that clicked?\n\nNothing actually, just trial and error\nUnderstood that mantra focus helps\n\nThanks for sharing your experience :)  \n  \nI got a question about a situation that maybe you have face over the past 2 years. ¬øDid it happen to you that you get lost some days during maditation?   \n  \nWith getting lost I mean not focusing on anything, not in your breath, nor what you are feeling, like not knowing \"where to stand\" during the meditation. It happens days the brain is restless and anxious, i get to calm it but really dificults the meditation time  \n\n\nIf it had happen to you and have any kind of \"recommendation\" or thought about it, please let me know about it  \n  \nThanks for reading üôè\n\nYeah man sure, think of it like bad days of workout\nIt's not really bad cause you're always progressing if you keep practicing.\nBut you gonna have some harder times to meditate, just try your best and don't be hard on your selfüòÅ\n\nthank you, i will keep that on mind üôÇ\n\nwas it breath focused meditation (Samatha) or Vipassana meditation that you‚Äôre practicing\n\nBreath focused with mantra\n\nWhat‚Äôs a mantra? How do you do that?\n\nWhat is your preferred method? Do you prefer focusing on breath, your surroundings, a mantra, trying to clear you mind completely, focusing on different subjects or questions each time, problems or questions, or something else? Or a combination depending on the day?\n\nMantra +breath\n\nBut sometimes i ask my self questions about my life, but you don't need just meditation to do it\n\nHow did you do it? Did you just sit in silence or did you use an app? Congrats very inspiring!\n\nNow i can sit anywhere anytime i don't need a sound\n\nBut my go to is some meditation music from spotify, and sit on my bed for as long as i can\n\nAlso i meditate alot on a light train when it's the most noisy haha\n\nNewbie here. What exactly do you do in these meditation sessions? Especially two years ago and then now.\n\nTwo years ago it was coping with that breakup so i would just sit saw all that pain, cry, breath\nLearning to relax and accept what happend\n\nNow it's more working on my breath and attention and the aftermath is that my awerness is higher so i cam cope with everything happens in my\nLife with more clarity, happines\n\nYeah, that's awesome and all but, HOW do you meditate, exactly?\n\nSorry not mentioning, my bad haha\nMantra focus on breath\n\nAh cool, where can I read up on this style?\n\nWhat do you do to meditate? Is it a guided meditation or do you sit in silence?\n\nSilence most of the time, and i do mantra while i breath in and while i breath out\nThat's how i keep my attention focused on my breath with the mantra\n\nEach moment i stop saying the mantra i know the monkey mind started working\nSo i notice it and keep\nGoing back to breath\n\nLove it!

Since in my experience I have been involved with Transcendental, Vipassana, Reiki, breathing techniques and more, so if I say the magic word, it comes with a description too. Please, enlighten me on your technique.\n\nSorry not mentioning,\nMantr based breath\n\nMy friend!

Now I know how the jehova witnesses feel lol\n\nThis is giving me hope that I can follow your example and make changes in my life. I have anxiety that causes me IBS. I noticed that I'm always on edge and have a difficult time just being. My anxiety and IBS are worse when I'm waiting for example waiting in line, on a train ride, at a theater, just around other people. I make a promise to myself that I will stay consistent and meditate too.\n\nYou got it!\n\nI really wanna get into meditation as I easily get stresses and angry. I want to become a calmer person. Could you recommend what to start with? Is ANY video on youtube actually good to click on? Or should I be looking for something more specific or a specific person/professor? A book maybe? Where do I actually learn meditation?\n\nJust start today by sitting 5 min for a week\nWith any guided meditation on youtube\nTry to focus on your breath\nAfter 1 week do 8 then 10 exc\nYou'l get used to it\n\nthank youu,¬†¬†I'll do it right now ü´∂üèª\n\n\"Meditation\" is such a broad term and corresponds to so many different practices and styles that it is difficult to talk to people here because everyone is referring to different practices and calling them all \"Meditation\". I think \"well, it's cool that this person is doing well and is happy, but what does Meditation mean to them?\"\n\nWhat does it mean to you?\nFor me, it is quieting my 'monkey' mind, my ego, and bringing the love of All That Is, through my lower chakras, into my heart and allowing my heart to distribute the love up through the rest of my chakras. I want my heart to open to the love of the universe so it reverberates to any other heart that's open to it.\nTo me, this is the miracle of love and openness.\n\nWhat I want to say is that the Op cited several benefits that he achieved by meditating for two years daily, but he didn't say the main information: what did he practice for two years? Did he practice shamatha for two years? Did he practice shikantaza? Did he practice metta bhavana? Did he practice Dzogchen? Do you understand?\n\nThe word \"Meditation\" corresponds to so many different practices that can lead to different benefits/results, but in this sub people don't specify what they are talking about.\n\nSemantics. Even if you and I call it the same thing, you can't equate your experience to be more or less the same as my experience. We only belong to the same cult. Meditation, regardless of style or culture or prescribed benefits, goes beyond language. Attachments to drugs or a guru or a posture is still attachment. Let's celebrate our similarities and not try to find language to build up the illusion of separation.\n\nShikantaza and metta bhavana, for example, are two types of meditation with peculiarities that go far, far beyond just semantics. The same happens with dzogchen, shamatha, vipassana, etc... each with its own particular characteristics and difficulties. \n\nTo say that the difference between these types of meditation is just semantics is not to recognize the diversity of existing practices and traditions.\n\nI donmt really know the term to it, i just focus on my breath while saying mantra to keep training my arttention on my breath\n\nDid you read any books in particular that helped you find the style of meditation that clicked?\n\nDid you read any books in particular that helped you find the style of meditation that clicked?\n\nSo meditation solved all of your problems?\n\nHaha hell no my friend\nJust made it more simple to handle them ;)\n\nJoe Dispenza had a book and guided meditations called Breaking the Habit of being yourself which is life changing. I have the audible version and the meditations are out of this world. I ve been meditating for years and this is the most scientific approach approach that I've found.\n\nI prefer not to set up expectations.\n\nI have tried it a couple times, but my mind keeps wandering. No matter what I do, body scan, guided meditation, focusing on breathing. My mind drifts away and after quite a while I notice that I haven‚Äôt been focused anymore for many minutes. Never tried that mantra thing, how does that work? \nI also have problems with sitting straight in a relaxed way. Not long after beginning the meditation some part of my body will either ache or tighten, mostly neck, shoulder or back. And when that happens, I cannot focus on anything.\n\nThe challenges you‚Äôve mentioned are very common for meditators. As a beginner myself (I started meditating in September last year and have been doing it on and off since), I‚Äôd like to share a few perspectives that might help:\n\n1. **There‚Äôs no such thing as a ‚Äúperfect‚Äù meditation.** Don‚Äôt feel discouraged if your mind wanders‚Äîit‚Äôs part of the process. The fact that you‚Äôre aware of it is already progress. Be kind to yourself and keep going.\n2. **Back and leg pain are also common.** For back pain, I sit with my back supported. For leg pain, I try to observe it closely when it arises. I‚Äôve discovered that pain is often temporary. Initially, it feels like it‚Äôs spread over a large area and won‚Äôt go away, but with observation, I‚Äôve noticed that it shifts.For example, the pain might start at point A, then fade and appear at point B. The more closely I observe, the less intense the pain feels. This doesn‚Äôt mean the pain disappears entirely, but this approach has helped me manage it better. You might want to try it and see if it helps even a little.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nThanks, gonna give it a try next time\n\n&gt;¬†¬†My mind drifts away and after quite a while I notice that I haven‚Äôt been focused anymore for many minutes.\n\nThat‚Äôs completely normal. When you notice that, just check what the breath is doing. Your mind will understand over time what you‚Äôre trying to do. Don‚Äôt give up. Try focusing on the physical touch of the air during each part of the breath. Relax your body as you do this. Have a light smile. Do not try to force everything else out of your mind. Just keep the breath within the mind\n\nThank you, I guess it‚Äôs all about consistency. Problem is to be consistent when you don‚Äôt see progress. Gotts have more patience probably\n\nYes. You may simply by overlooking the progress as well. You may not be aware of it. One thing that was very, very useful for me in the past was journaling after meditation about what I experienced. What happened? How did I feel? Anything notable? Etc. This post-meditation reflection greatly increased my ability to improve in meditation, as well as helped me notice what was going well, what was working, and also what problems seemed to be afoot. For example, if I finished a 10 min session and wrote down that I had hardly been aware for the entirety of the session, I‚Äôd start wondering how to fix that. What to do next time? Making plans. This sort of thing really helped me. Good luck!\n\nThank you üôè\n\nThank you. The starting with 5 minutes is doable.\n\nYour story is nice \nI too have been practicing for 30 years 1 hour a day or even 2 hours \nMy record 5 hours in 5 minutes The more we meditate, the more space time shrinks \nThere is a milestone at the mental level, it is from the 60th minute to the 70th. By observing yourself, it is possible to capture the magic second, sometimes it is 30 seconds. \nDoing this regularly opens the Heart and pineal gland connection \nSometimes now there is a connection to the void Thought stops I manage to live this moment for 1 minute it's totally delirious Detachment is essential Staying in the simplicity of things is necessary This brings inner peace and permanent answers to unsolvable problems\n\nIf I have to give advice \nJust sit back and let the moment pass, that‚Äôs the secret to liberation.\n\nGuys I used to meditate everyday and I also felt so blissful and was constantly having synchronicities/coincidences but now I want to meditate but I feel so easily distracted by everything else in the world that I end up never doing it but I used to feel so extremely warm and my chest felt light and it‚Äôs really an uplifting feeling and while I don‚Äôt constantly feel it every once in a while I‚Äôll be listening to music and I‚Äôll get a surge of pure feeling enough to make me cry I just feel so connected but it only lasts for like 3-5 seconds and I try so hard to hold on to it but it‚Äôs gone\n\nStart simple. Just sit and relax for some time\n\nYou can also try some forms of vipassana, such as self inquiry. Both in meditation and outside of it. For example, when you‚Äôre distracted, you could ask, who is distracted? Find the sense of ‚ÄúI‚Äù of the one who considers themselves distracted ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nThanks for sharing, love hearing from more experienced people!\n\nI used to meditate a lot. There was the benefits I also received below. However I still like to drink. \nI also got many euphoric experiences \nIt‚Äôs quite life changing\n\n[removed]\n\nAs a general rule, self-promotion is not allowed.

    "body": "Hi.\n\nI did a Vippassanna retreat at age 20. I'm 30 now. At the time I had a girlfriend, a healthy social life with friends etc. I went into that retreat because someone that I thought was cool and respected had done it, so I did it too, probably thinking that I would come out with the same attributes as they had. Dumb I know, but I was insecure and 20yo.\n\nOn the retreat I experienced some pshycosis and paranoia, with a high awareness of my own thought processes. It fucked me up, but I stayed on,.because I didn't wasn't to be 'defeated'. \n\nUpon my return I found that I was now more aware of my thoughts which I didn't want to be and the voices in my head louder and more 'real' somehow. I became unable to distinguish my thoughts from reality. \n\nI found that I wanted to be alone all the time, and couldn't relax with friends. I didn't enjoy anything anymore and was more aware of my mind than I wanted to be. \n\nI'm 30 now. No friends, no gf since I broke up with her shortly after doing the course. People don't like being around me and find me frustrating/difficult/awkward/socially inept. I wasn't always like this. Certainly not before the course\n\nIm afraid that Vippassanna fucked me up for good. I just want to be alone ALL the time and am thinking about becoming a monk. I don't enjoy anything, can't make serious money and can't seem to form/maintain relationships.  So what is the point? \n\nI want to run away and become a monk, and embrace simplicity and for-go all this pretending to be normal, because I'm not and never will be again. And don't say  'what is normal'?, because it certainly isn't being lost in your own mind and paranoid about what other are thinking. \n\nTried various therapies/therapist and doesn't work. Their frustrated by their inability to figure out whats going on with me. \n\nPlease advise. Any similar negative vippassana experiences would be comforting, but also maybe the only way to get out of this is to keep on practising? \nThankyou. ",

    "all_comment_text": "Hey, mate. I think you should look for a psychiatrist. This sounds a bit like some sort of psychosis or scizophrenia, and of course therapists will help, but I think a doctor specialized in mental disorders would help you a lot in this case. I had an auntie with scizophrenia, who had some similar symptoms to you, and when she was treated and medicated, she could live a good life and form healthy relationships, with only minimal \"crisis\". She had a husband and friends and a daughter.\n\nI'm saying this because your experiences match and because many of those disorders manifest in early adulthood if you have a trigger, just like what happened to you. So I suspect something like this might be happening, and if it is, you will be able to fix it, or at least feel better with treatment.\n\nYou don't have to be trapped in this forever. Sending you a hug.\n\nI second this. Psychosis and schizophrenia tend to show up in your 20‚Äôs. Psychedelics can also trigger them. I don‚Äôt see why meditation couldn‚Äôt either.\n\nMeditation can make a lot of hidden stuff arise and trigger more brain activity temporarily, so that makes sense.\n\nExactly what I thought‚Ä¶ especially a mentally taxing experience like Vipassana can be\n\nMeditation can be an altered state of consciousness like psychedelics so it makes sense that it could trigger the same stuff.¬†\n\nYeah that does make a lot of sense.\n\nMy very first thought (psych student) was some form of psychosis / Schizophrenia. Please see a doctor!\n\nAnd don‚Äôt discount therapy. It takes a while to find the right one, but it‚Äôs trial and error!\n\nI‚Äôm no psychiatrist but for me this sounds like OCD, mine showed up late teens.\n\nOCD can definitely cause some of these symptoms, thats true, but the ‚Äúvoices‚Äù they‚Äôre describing it sounds much more predatory and invasive than simply intrusive thoughts. I have OCD myself, and it can definitely suck at times, but i feel like this is a bit closer to psychosis/schizophrenia (not to mention OP spoke about going through psychosis aswell)\n\n[deleted]\n\nThank you for the well wishes! I‚Äôm currently training to become a Therapist. I guess having personal experience makes it easier to understand the condition itself haha. If I can pass that understanding onto others, so they can learn more about our experiences? Then I feel like ive fulfilled something in my life.\n\nYeah this is good advice. At least get it looked at and decide how to proceed from there. Psychosis is no joke.\n\nThis right here üëÜ\n\nThe first person OP should be talking to is a psychiatrist.  Not a meditation instructor.\n\nIdeally a psychiatrist that knows a bit about meditation. A big ask, I know.\n\nThankyou! I should 'voices' aren't actual voices. Just very loud thoughts that do go away, but seem 'pressing' at the time, and they are usually thoughts about myself and how I'm coming across to others. But is very distracting!\n\nI don't understand how the therapist would not address the sticky thoughts about worrying what others are thinking. That right there is taking up all your mental energy.¬†\n\n\nIt can become less and less of a burden. Have you tried therapy more recently or only when you were in your 20s. I've had much greater success in therapy in my 30s as I know myself much better.¬†\n\n\nIt seems like there's a lot of pressure you're putting on yourself to be a certain way and to be at a certain place sucessfully in your life.¬†\nThe mental processes you have in place to protect you as a kid and young adult were built up over the years.¬†\nThey alert you with overactive and distracting thought forms that need to be taken down a few levels as far as their impact on your nervous system and mental strain.¬†¬†\n\n\nThat can be done with CBT, mindfulness based stress reduction, and other ways.¬†\n\n\nSome physical exercise like yoga will help reconnect you and ground you.¬†\nYou're okay and you're safe.\n\nCBT is really awesome for those kind of intrusive thoughts. Definitely find a psychiatrist though OP. Your experience definitely seems like some kind of psychosis/schizophrenia. Getting proper treatment will help you get better. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π\n\nI wonder if EMDR or something similar could be helpful. ‚ô•Ô∏èüôèüèª\n\nI think you should clear this up in your post as people are taking it literally and responding as if you are literally hearing voices.\n\nI have the same kind of ‚Äúvoices‚Äù, they‚Äôre thoughts which sound like I can hear what the other person is thinking and what they‚Äôre thinking is always negative judgement towards me. They always sound like shit I‚Äôve heard in the past from my mother or school bullies. Walking in public is tormenting because my mind is always making up what everyone around me is thinking about me. I‚Äôve partially addressed this in therapy and I‚Äôve had life experiences (as well as psychedelic experiences in safe settings) which have helped me come to terms it‚Äôs all my imagination and (possibly) not reality.\n\nI wonder if your problem was exacerbated during meditation because there you didn‚Äôt have distractions so naturally that made space for your mind. Then you created tension by not wanting these thoughts as you had expectations about what your thoughts should/shouldn‚Äôt be. The more you unwanted these thoughts, the more the tension grew, causing exponential discomfort.\n\nThis sounds like it could be OCD actually, which is highly treatable. I‚Äôd suggest looking into it. Talk therapy typically makes OCD worse, which is why you might not have experienced any help with regular therapy! In the meantime I‚Äôd recommend reading Dr. Michael Greenberg‚Äôs articles on rumination and awareness vs attention, I think this could help regardless of what you are experiencing!\n\nGood luck OP ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nCould be worth getting checked for OCD. Common symptoms include really strong compulsive thoughts, and that can extend to hyper analysing your own behaviour and those of others. I would recommend to take a look into the symptoms, you might find ways of dealing with it if you are indeed affected by it! Hope you find peace either way dude ü´∂üèª\n\nI see! It sounds like it could be paranoia, my friend. My auntie would have these thoughts too (although I think hers were a lot more irrational, but yours do seem to bring you a lot of suffering). But it could also be some form of OCD, maybe. Anyway, I hope you can get the help you need and feel better with time!\n\nI have to say I agree, I have worked as a psych nurse for many years (older adult population 55+) and have heard of symptoms  like this developing at this time in life for many people. It's a common age to see this manifest. \n\nOf course strangers on the internet can't diagnose you, it would be best to see a psychiatrist to evaluate your case.\n\nYes and to add these issues often manifest in early 20‚Äôs. The retreat didn‚Äôt cause it it just made you aware. It would have happened anyway. Sorry you‚Äôre going through this, but I know ppl who‚Äôve been there and when they find and STAY on the right meds they return to their old selves and live great lives. I wish you luck\n\nFirst thing I thought after the first couple paragraphs.\n\nI agree, I would keep searching for the right doctor. Don't give up, sending positive vibes!\n\nI did not know this was a thing - but 21 is a prime time for the symptoms of schizophrenia to emerge.\n\nYep... right around the cusp of adulthood. If you're prone to psychosis, dumping yourself off into a vipassana retreat (especially if you're inexperienced with meditation in the first place) can do a reeeeeal number on you.\n\nPsychedelic use has a similar effect of exposing latent mental health divergence\n\nIt seems like for some people, these things can rip off your mask that you didn't even know was there to begin with.\n\nThis is something that should be talked about - especially with homeboy doing the 10% happier book which really shed major light on the 10 day retreats and never mentioning this could be an outcome.\n\nchubby illegal bright vanish late thumb cats muddle pot offbeat\n\n *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev/home)*\n\nThis, and the other comments below this.  \nIf it hadn't been the vipassana retreat, it could have been an overwhelming situation while traveling abroad, or smoking a reefer, that triggered the episode. If you're wired that way, it will come out.\n\nI suspect meditation is not the way for you, that a form of somatic therapy would be better suited, but I'm a lay-person. Just something to look into maybe? Also, have you takne time to grieve over this massive change that uprooted your life - it could be a way to put things in perspective.\n\nFrom my experience with an uncle of mine, I know that self-awareness of this condition isn't always a given. So you have one thing at least, awareness about your situation. And you're still looking for solutions. Keep looking, keep trying, something will come up, and maybe being in a monastery for a while is just what you need, but remember to leave if it doesn't give you what you need.\n\nETA: echoing others because important: if you haven't seen a psychiatrist yet, please go see one.\n\nBon courage!\n\nReally?  I thought it was teenage years?\n\nMost commonly rears its head in our 20s, especially when we're genetically predisposed.\n\nI remember doing some deep reading on the matter as someone who enjoys psychedelics and had it in the family (grandmother).\n\n17-25\n\nBrother, I‚Äôve been there. I‚Äôve been there to a very severe degree. Have faith and hold out some hope you can get better because I did. I‚Äôm myself again and you can be too. I dont know if there‚Äôs a simple answer to it, mine was finding a therapist that had been through it.\n\nBe kind to yourself, you‚Äôre still here. You‚Äôre building the strength to get through it mate. Here for a chat anytime I check my reddit messages üòÜ\n\nTo add on to @rmk91, don‚Äôt ‚Äúhope‚Äù, you have to know and believe in yourself. This a time for you to grow the most honestly, your SELF is revealed and you need to take the time to water your garden. Speak to yourself, nurture your mind with good thoughts and one day you look back at that situation and realize God did it on purpose for you to grow.\n\nSuch good advice ü•∞\n\nI‚Äôm so sorry you‚Äôre going through this‚Ä¶ this hyper awareness is just around your own thoughts or also bodily sensations/existence also?\n\nI experienced severe psychotic breaks in my early twenties and suffered the exact symptoms you are describing for about 5 years, though my onset was triggered by a lengthy string of high-dose LSD trips in a desert commune over a  period of about 7 months. I never could get relief from the constant paranoia, the suicidal/homicidal thoughts, the head voices, the existential panic attacks accompanied by bouts of crippling catatonia. \n\nIf your experience was anything like mine, what happened is through your practice, your mind was able to completely detangle ineffable reality from its web of representation, probably only for a moment. This act of 'thinking outside of/beyond your own existence' sent your mind into a shock that caused it to quickly re-contextualize your entire existence by stitching together patterns of cosmology and narrative available to it at the time, in an effort to re-solidify the sense of self. This act is the psychotic break, and the result is that you entered an entirely different context of existence; nothing is as it seemed before. Because this context was so shoddily assembled in panic, it is flimsy and constantly building and re-defining aspects of itself. In this scenario, the mind will derive rationale out of the most nonsensical or improbable narratives, resulting in one thinking things like:\n\n1. You are the only thing thats real, everyone else is fake.\n\n2. Everyone can hear your thoughts, or certain people can.\n\n3. Certain people are \"out to get you\" because you know too much.\n\n4. The world is some sort of simulation.\n\n5. Angels/Demons/Gods/Aliens etc.. are communicating with you through thoughts or scenarios played out in your daily life\n\n6. etc.. \n\nWhat finally helped me was to go deeper into buddhism. Theravada Buddhism is where I went but Mahayana is also beneficial. It helped me to identify the foundational mechanics of paranoid delusions, to view my thoughts, reality, and the relationship between them in a different view. From where you are I would think it isnt possible to go back to where you were before the retreat, but going deeper can facilitate the transformation of paranoia into pronoia, which is imo a much better and smoother platform to operate from.\n\nI was able to find a very knowledgeable teacher who guided me, and would recommend the same.\n\nOne thing I wouldnt recommend is trying to \"figure it out\" by yourself. There are so many pitfalls in western culture in relation to psychosis that lead to becoming trapped in contexts that breed anxiety and violence.\n\nDamn. This is quite the journey.\n\nSame thing happened to me man. Amazing how many of us there might be. I am ok now as well, maybe even thriving. Thanks for introducing me to the word \"pronoia.\" You might like the book \"rethinking madness.\" Interesting how your description of growth also reflects common psychotherapeutic practices (the same things that helped me, including extreme thought defusion practices and continuing to grow my meditation which was a practice before the breaks). \n\nRight now I'm working on being able to be honest with people in my profession (I work in counseling) to try to help people. I cant help but feel shame for those times, even though I know I couldn't control myself. I also worry about losing respect and facing the stigma that I see so frequently from many therapists and providers. Wish the four of us on this thread could have a support group lol.\n\nI was thinking of going to a vipassana retreat. Does this mean I should not go? I would like to go to a shorter retreat, but I don‚Äôt know of any that are free. I was thinking of staying at vipassana center because it is free and I need time to break away, recollect myself, and meditate. I was even thinking of volunteering as well.\n\nThis is a risk factor but probably pretty low. You can consider all your risk factors including family history of mental health problems, current mental health factors (depression, anxiety, mania, bizarre ideas, dissociation etc), current level of meditation experience, current support system health, and history of serious trauma.\n\nBasically, this won't happen to the vast majority of ppl who go on retreats.  You might look into \"respite services\" in your area - some places have grant and volunteer run centers where you can kick back for a while for free, do your own meditation etc. Wishing you luck\n\nI had an amazing experience at my vipassana retreat. It was one of the most difficult things I voluntarily put myself through at the time. Meditating pretty much nonstop for 10 days with no verbal communication or external distractions is incredibly intense and challenging, but 100% worth it for all the growth I was able to accomplish within that timespan. It gives one a very solid foundation for further spiritual/personal development\n\nFuck.... I think something like this happened to me.......\n\nI'm genuinely surprised there aren't more posts like this. There are so many ways for us to disrupt the programming of our ritual mind. Disruption is almost the norm, not the adverse result. \n\nThese issues manifest themselves throughout our society on a statistically significant basis. I highly suggest OP and anyone else on this journey read some of what Joseph Campbell has to say on this subject. As well as Adolous Huxley. \n\n\"Going deeper\" is the correct prescription. But doing so with some anchoring to more healthy and productive discursive narrative (i.e. something that supports pronoia; Buddhism, Church, sports, even work to a degree...) is truly the correct methodology. \n\nGood luck OP. And you too anon. I have to bet there are a lot of people who share this experience. \n\nJo Campbell https://www.wnyc.org/story/dr-joseph-campbell-inward-journey-schizophrenia-and-mythology/\n\nHuxley \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Doors_of_Perception?wprov=sfla1\n\nEDIT: Apparently no one wants to read about OS memory management and actually wants to read about Huxleys Doors of Perception\n\n&gt; Huxley https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_paging?wprov=sfla1\n\nI don't know what operating system's memory management can do to help OP, but maybe I haven't gone deep enough ü§î\n\nDamn I think this happened to me in my early 20s. Well said and thank you!\n\nBrilliant analysis of your psychotic break... damn, you've got a good handle on you're experience. I aspire to that, somewhat similar experience\n\nI'm sorry to hear this. \n\nI recommend you contact Willoughby Britton of Cheetah House. She specializes in meditation issues. See their website. \n\nThere's a recent podcast \"Untold: The Retreat\" which deals with post retreat Vipassana problems. \n\nI think you should continue with therapists. Perhaps you can familarize them with Britton's research and the podcast. \n\nThis issue with the length of ten years is above Reddits paygrade. People not so rare come out of a retreat in a Vipassana funk -- and here getting grounded with healthy diet, enough sleep, exercise, art, going for hikes -- is good advice. But this going on for ten years, I don't think playing with a dog or kitten will resolve it.\n\n+1 on cheetah house\n\nWanting to add that 10 years on and seemingly no foothold into what snapped or went sideways.  There might be significant mental illness here or heavy psychological stuff may have been unearthed.  It's not fixing itself.\n\nInteresting topic\n\nthanks for mentioning the podcast. I actually had a spot booked to go for a 10 day course but after listening to the podcast and reading OPs experience, I've cancelled my spot.\n\nYou saved your ass mate.\n\n100% THIS!! Cheetah House is an amazing resource\n\n[deleted]\n\nnowhere did they suggest more meditation.\n\n&gt; He doesn't need more meditation, he needs serious psychiatric help\n\nIf you haven't already, you should probably look at the Cheetah House website. I think you will see pretty quickly that they are not likely to recommend \"more meditation\" for fixing problems like those exhibited by the OP. \n\nCheck out the site's list of symptoms and related resources, for instance:\n\nhttps://www.cheetahhouse.org/symptoms\n\nI think the Cheetah House recommendation is a good one:\n\n* The OP is reporting adverse effects of meditation, but doesn't appear to be seeking professional mental health care at the moment because professionals are \"frustrated by their inability to figure out whats going on with me.\" OTOH, Dr. Britton seems like a good resource for this particular problem as she has PhD in clinical psychology and specializes in the adverse effects of meditation.\n* The OP is asking for similar stories from meditators. The Cheetah House administrators support a peer-led discussion group for meditators-in-distress.\n\nThis comment has opened up a lot of hope for me. I'm going through similar experiences as OP. \n\nTo find out there's actually a group specializing in adverse effects of meditative practices has truly opened up a new light of hope into my life. \nThank you very much for this recommendation.\n\nAny CBT practicing psychologist will tell you that the majority of your thoughts are literal garbage. You are not your thoughts. All of your organs are constantly working, otherwise you‚Äôd be dead, and it‚Äôs normal for your brain to constantly produce thoughts, inner dialogue, and dreams. They are a byproduct of your brain function, just like gurgling in your stomach or farts in your ass. Remind yourself that next time you‚Äôre having intrusive thoughts. It gets easier with practice. This is a non-medical advice. If you suspect having schizophrenia, which is typically genetic and develops before the age of 30 (may or may not be your case), please get psychiatric help.\n\nIt definitely sounds like this is more than just intrusive thoughts.  OP said he was hearing voices.  CBT and coping skills like thought diffusion/redirection, perception checking, and thought replacement can be extremely helpful when managing psych symptoms from a more stabilized foundation.  If he is experiencing anything like psychosis, engaging with CBT skills will be much more difficult and will not address the complexity of the underlying issue(s).\n\nAs a therapist who works with acute mental health, it is hard to say for sure whether OP is experiencing schizophrenia or OCD or paranoia without further assessment.  \n\nOP, working with a psychiatrist (and also a somatic, trauma informed therapist) even to just hear out their recommendations would be well worth your time before you make any decisions.  It may not feel like going full isolated monk is an impulsive decision, but it definitely is when taking into account the other contextual factors you mentioned in your post. \n\nIn the meantime, perhaps taking a break from meditation or finding alternative, simpler, more subtle ways to practice mindfulness as a present moment orientation, not a rigorous and highly structured meditation practice.  Examples of areas to practice mindfulness: making the bed, walking outside, listening to music, cooking/eating, gentle stretching.\n\nHe clarified that he‚Äôs hearing his own thoughts. I find early meditation stressful too because I think in words. Being fully conscious of and noting the thousand stupid observations my brain makes is exhausting.\n\nSorry you‚Äôre going through that bud . The thing is with meditation and tools alike is that they tend to awake things in us that we push down and want to forget . You have to realize you are the ‚Äúwatcher‚Äù, the ‚Äúobserver‚Äù. Yes the thoughts do come from you but they are not you . ‚ÄúYou are not the body, you are not even the mind ‚Äú. We are the source that watches the play unfold in front of us . Our job is to not get too engage with those ‚Äúthoughts ‚Äú or ‚Äúfeelings‚Äù . Much love and blessings on your journey\n\nThis a lot.\n\nOP, you are always in control. The voices are just other sides of you. All people have more than 1 voice in their head. Some people call it morals, conscious, etc. End of the day, you are what decides who you are and what you stand for.\n\nExercise does help but it eventually won't feel like enough. Quieting the voices by becoming one in your own mind is what will help you be the you that you want to be. Remember you're the one in control. Nobody else makes your decisions besides you. If you feel solitude is what you truly want, try it. If you feel like it's something pushing you to be alone, recognize that it is not what you truly want, and reinforce what you truly want.\n\nFiguring out what happens afterward is your choice.\n\nThis is not the first such case. Starting right out with a 10 day meditation is dangerous, which is what they insist on. In most zen centers, one is required to do shorter retreats before taking on a 7 day sesshin retreat, which is grueling physically as well as mentally.\n\nI second this. I have heard of this with people going ‚Äúall in‚Äù without any training or real understanding of what meditation actually is. This is sad bc Op is definitely suffering in the sense of the word that we all understand.  I agree this could be chemical. Opting out of life is certainly not the answer here.\n\nYeah I've been meditating for most of the past 10 years, mostly just 10‚Äì15 minutes per day most days of the week, and I still have no desire to try something like a 10-day retreat like OP did. I can't imagine what such deep and long meditations sessions are like for someone completely new to it.\n\nI fell into some deep spiritual experiences as a young person. A little later in life, I was uncomfortable with myself, my habits, and my distance from those earlier experiences of oneness, peace, and feeling alive. I had been thinking I need to develop a meditation practice, so after some people I knew and respected had gone to free 10 day Vipasennas, my partner/spouse and I ended up deciding to give it a shot. \n\nI went in hopeful and really gave it a good effort. But I had also been a sociology/ social sciences \nmajor and I just couldn‚Äôt get over how manipulative the program was. It had multiple qualities of brainwash. Guenka was preying on people‚Äôs misery and promising true joy and happiness by following ‚Äúhis way‚Äù. No reading, no talking, no stimulation, no contact with the outside world‚Ä¶ except for regular video recordings of guenka repeating these same tropes again and again. Echoing words. ‚ÄúYou are in the shackles of misery. Misery. Misery‚Ä¶.miseryyyy.‚ÄùHe would at times talk about people who struggled with the program, and then basically make fun of them and their struggle. It was all just so over the top and I thought about how someone more vulnerable emotionally or spiritually could get into trouble at this place. My partner was going through some serious mental health crises in their life at that time, and I worried for them too. \n\nI continued to try to be an earnest participant, though. I believed in meditation and had general gravitation to explore eastern philosophy and religion at the time. I wanted to believe that this could help despite my increasing view that Guenka was potentially dangerous in ways. \n\nDay 4 or so during a Guenka recording I had to pee and just couldn‚Äôt take it anymore with this guy and so i got up in the middle of the assembly or whatever and went to the bathroom. I‚Äôm peeing and I hear behind me, ‚Äúis everything alright?‚Äù \nFirst time I‚Äôd been spoken to in 5 days. I replied yes I just need to pee. And right then and there he lectured me that it‚Äôs particularly important that I don‚Äôt leave the building while Guenka‚Äôs recordings are on. OK. It felt extreme to me that they followed me into the bathroom to say this. \n\nStill, I tried to make it through, but I recognized my concerns now as a real distraction to my meditation, so the next day I brought my concern with to the assistant teacher person at the slotted time for questions. I was polite and genuinely had some faith that this person might have an enlightened answer for me. He said the problem was with me and I needed to submit to the program. I wasn‚Äôt sold. \n\nI decided to leave. I told one of the people I was leaving. The guy seemed a little frantic about it. They kind of made a big deal about it and made me speak with the leader person before going. They tried to convince me to stay. I had made up my mind, but had one concern. That my partner would see me suddenly missing for some days, in a manipulative environment, while processing traumas etc. Knowing my partner, I thought my disappearing might be scary- we hadn‚Äôt discussed or considered the possibility. So I asked them to inform my partner that I was ok, but leaving and would return to pick them up. They said no. And that if I left, i needed to stay there until the next meditation, and then quickly and quietly leave. I asked why, and one of them said so that no one will see me leave. I asked why that mattered, and he literally said because they didn‚Äôt want me to give others ideas. They could have just said it would be an interruption. So at this point I‚Äôm really creeped out by this place and the program, and feel I can‚Äôt abandon my vulnerable life parter at this place. So I change my tune and say, ok, you convinced me, I‚Äôll stay.  I guess they werent convinced because the head guy made me swear my devotion to Buddha and Guenka before returning. I hope this doesn‚Äôt damn me eternally, but having lost all faith and on a higher mission, I agreed and went back. \n\nLong story still long- I slipped my parter a note and set up a rendezvous. It was scary and hilarious. They decided to stay in the end and I gladly regained a few days of my life. \n\nI don‚Äôt know what help you need, but I can appreciate the real possibility that you developed some narratives at Vipassena that are unhealthy and hard to shake.\n\nThat was super interesting, thank you for sharing. I'm glad that it sounds like came out of this ok, and really hope so did your partner in the end!\n\nI think what you need to do is try to get away from your thoughts and mind and come back into your body. Don‚Äôt meditate anymore for a long time. Just focus on moving your body. Take up an activity that can be solo or social, for me ice skating was perfect as I could practice alone or compare progress with others if I wanted. Nobody on the ice cares or talks about anything but ice skating. And you have to focus only on how your body is moving or you fall. It just gives my mind such a break, society doesn‚Äôt matter, nothing matters except moving my body correctly. I think you need to do something like this. It could be another movement activity like cycling, swimming, skateboarding, rollerblading, running. Something like this that you need to work at and improve at. It will kickstart your healing. \n\nEverything you‚Äôre experiencing in life is happening in your mind. So screw your mind and just live in your body for a while. It is always there taking care of you and working hard for you. Just come down into your body and enjoy its movement. Get away from spiritual stuff for a good while too. You‚Äôve gotta ground yourself harder than ever right now.\n\nthis sounds like good advice to give it a go :‚Äô) \n\nim a yoga practitioner myself and in the study of yoga, there are many paths of entry. many people learn best via movement (asana) to slow down their thoughts, connect with their body and breath. thereafter we tune into sensations of our body and observe what our body is feeling, experiencing and eventually what it is telling us. \n\nour mind is in constant flux and some thoughts arent very helpful for us and it can be difficult to discern the usefulness of the messy mind‚Ä¶ so the ‚Äòbottom up‚Äô approach via the body could be it, for you. perhaps.\n\nthere is also pranayama, breathing techniques and other modalities. \n\nit may be a slow process, but hey lets take it slow and gentle. show the body compassion, and you‚Äôll get there :‚Äô) \n\nanother i might suggest is [somatic therapy] or [somatic experiencing]. look around for any such therapist that feel safe to you, in your area, offering this and test out for a few sessions and see how your body feels from there? pain, emotions communicate through the body from what i understand and benefited from.\n\nany form of movement can be helpful, ranging from physically slow to intensive. yoga asana, rock climbing, rollerblading, ice-skating, snowboarding \n\nany sport or movement that speaks to you and something you can do regularly is GOOOD\n\np.s thank you for this post, a cry for help x\n\nThanks, this might be helpful to me also.\n\nI‚Äôm not saying you have this, but do a little bit of research into Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. I‚Äôve had obsessions that feel like psychosis or a huge change in reality only to realize I was actually obsessing and feeding into the compulsive loop.\n\nThis was also my experience, it genuily feels like your going crazy.\n\nSounds like hyperawareness ocd to me, OP sounds smart, aware and not psychotic at all to me, sometimes people with this type of Pure O think they‚Äôre psychotic which isn‚Äôt the case..\n\nTrue. The disorder really is a trickster. Can trick you into so many different feelings. As well as reassurance seeking. Existential OCD is very real and feels extremely life altering\n\nHello, I work with mental health and while like some in this thread say your experience could be related to developing psychosis it is far from the only explanation. Having some sort of odd or paranoid thoughts is something we all have from time to time. What stands out to me is that you seem to focus a lot on your thoughts and turn your attention inward towards your mind and perhaps your physical experience. This would be counter to having your attention outward towards what you are doing, be that hanging out with friends or doing chores or whatever else. You also seem to ruminate and think thoughts like \"Im afraid that Vippassanna fucked me up for good.\" Perhaps you also worry alot thinking thoughts like \"what if i never get better\"?\n\nThere is a therapy called Metacognitive therapy that helps clients drastically reduce the time and energy the dedicate to their thoughts and teach them skill to direct their attention outwards towards the goals and activities that you want to fill your life with. The therapy has great evidence from RCT studies as well as meta-analysis. Please look into receiving this form of therapy, i think it sound perfect for the symptoms you experience. It works well over video link to if you happen to not have any therapist available in your area.\n\nMeditation did the exact same thing to me. I became hyper aware of my thoughts after extensive intense meditation practice and literally had to stop for a very long time.\n\nSorry, to hear about your bad experience. Sorry is an understatement too. You continue to sound lucid in your writing which is a good sign. However, you need to be careful in the type of meditation you practice. Practice of long duration which slowly shifts into fantasy can make things worse. Essentially, this was what happened at that retreat. Sadly, there is a history of such things happening on those retreats. But, the retreat is in the past for you and you must make the best of your situation. \n\nThe best way would be to practice under the closely supervision of a mental health practitioner who is used to helping people like you who have had that bad experience. The late eminent psychiatrist Dr Ainslie Meares had success in helping people who had had a bad experience similar to the one you have had and stressed the need for them to be supervised and to closely follow a good set of instructions when practicing for relatively short durations of 10-15 minutes twice daily. He wrote a couple of books that explain it and easiest to get these days is Ainslie Meares on Meditation. \n\nAnyway, I wish you good luck in moving forwards.\n\nWow what an incredible response from everyone! Thankyou all!\n\nSorry to hear that. As far as I know Vipassana retreats also provide consultation afterwards. If you feel like it you can hit them up and ask for their views. (Despite happening 10 years ago)\n\nHave you tried seeing a psychologist? What did they say?\n\nbefore Vipassana, you were simply living off of reactions without too much self introspection and awareness. The whole point of Vipassana is to still your external world movements and turn your awareness inside towards your inner experience. \n\nUsually becoming aware of our reactions, mental and physical, is a painful process because we realize how bound we have been to our past, to a mode of autopilot that doesn't allow much freedom of choice. This is why during Vipassana the practice of equanimity is highlighted over and over. You observe reactions you feel the emotions and you let go, let go, let go. \n\nBecoming aware of your thought processes is not an easy, or peaceful process as most of us have been trained to judge ourselves harshly when we fall off our idea of \"perfect\". \n\nWhat you experienced there is normal and is in line with the practice of Vipassana. But instead of practicing equanimity you clung to a judgement and have rolled with it for the last couple of years. You can decide to let it go. It will require self introspection, awareness and a lot of compassion. \n\nVipassana is only a tool for self awareness, your judgement and harshness against what it brought up is what caused your anguish. We've all been caught up in unhealthy or unproductive mind/body patterns, and we may always on some layer be. So it's ok. \n\nI recommend a practice that will generate self compassion. It will begin to unravel the knot you have been caught in. \n\nI wish you all the best.\n\nHi man,\n\nI am so sorry to hear this but there is hope if you take the right steps :) Keep working at it. It might be good to chat with a psychologist, I had a similar experience after a prolonged period of stress at work(I work in child protection) and with some help, I discovered I was experiencing an OCD episode which can feel quite similar to what you're describing. Being aware sometimes isn't the problem, rather you might be giving too much power to the thoughts that's what I was doing. The pattern of negotiating and trying to make sense of something non-sensical is a loosing battle, the right types of meditations help with acceptance. \n\nIt's been a few years now but with Breathwork, some therapy, the love of family and learning to accept that thoughts don't mean all that much, you will slowly move forward, aim for 1% every week brotha. It takes a while but it's a great challenge. \n\nThere is also a great book called The Vagus Nerve Reset by Anna Ferguson which I quite liked. Find an immersing project that takes you out of your thoughts and focus on helping others. The other thing I did which was a game changer is I focused on all the subtle observations that you experience in a conversation and I used affirmations and still do. \n\nLots of care and all the best.\n\nYeah I think OP needs to find an OCD therapist not regular ones‚Ä¶\n\nI remember Vajrayana teacher/Tibetan medicine doctor Dr. Nida talked about this phenomenon. Try writing to him or see if you can get in touch with him. [www.drnida.com](https://www.drnida.com)\n\none thing you might want to try is switching to body based practice. This can get you away from the mind and back into the body. One daoist modality for this is outlined here [https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/1bv3sda/comment/kxwzdhp/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/1bv3sda/comment/kxwzdhp/)\n\nHey dude, I think many are being quite presumptuous with schizophrenia. Could be more so a mood disorder like bipolar maybe even schizoid personality? Schizophrenic writing is usually way more chaotic haha. Agree with the retreat causing a meditation induced psychosis that's precipitated the change in behaviour. \n\nDefinitely see a psychiatrist if you can but it's your decision with taking medication long term if deemed necessary but give a try and try a couple. Mood stabilizers weren't for me. \n\nHow much practice in meditation had you had prior to the retreat? How long was it? \n\nIm bipolar and planning on going one in November, have 4ish years of I suppose ok experience and study\n\nThere's actually a foundation that helps people with negative experiences following meditation. It's called the Cheetah House. You are definitely not alone in this- they'll for sure have resources to help you.\nMend well, my friend. \n https://www.cheetahhouse.org/\n\nI think we should be careful not to project our own experiences and try to diagnose what this person has gone through. Every indidivual life is infinitely complex and we can't come close to another's experience of reality. More awareness of one's thoughts and a paradigm shift in how we see or understand life isn't necessarily psychopathology. If the ideas intrude in everyday functioning or distort reality, and if real hallucinations are present, then that's an entirely different matter. Language is tricky when describing our subjective inner world. The most important indicator is the amount of suffering and dysfunction being caused. It's hard to say from a mere post if the problem is of a psychological nature requiring healing, biological pertaining to faulty neurochemistry, or if it's more spiritual / existential. Sometimes positive growth can come from a chaotic state, that's what happens in cases of what Dabrowski calls positive disintegration. This might represent an opportunity to pursue meaning and reintegrate as a more authentic self in a world that dissuades us from being genuine. Ultimately chosing a journey to embark on and comitting to it can help give a direction to the suffering. The models that exist are different and need to be helpful to the person themselves. For some psychiatric diagnoses give sense and direction, for others its spirituality.\n\nu/OrcishMonk seems to have the best answer and an expert to contact. I'd do that\n\nMy lame advice: Are you giving too much attention to the thoughts? It should be the middle way between blocking them and focusing on them. They're just thoughts. You can't control what arises but you can practice not getting hooked by them. Being the mirror rather than its contents, though the contents still appear\n\nHave you tried Metta meditation? It is a practice where the intention is to generate feelings of compassion and love for yourself and all\nliving beings. Very healing for me. Took a while to learn but it is definitely necessary for me to meditate. I do Metta  with open awareness meditation to keep myself in healthy balance.\n\nThis is not because pf vipassana, you have a mental disorder which is a completely different thing. Seek help and treatment. This can happen to anyone.\n\nDepersonalization/derealization?\n\nI feel similar‚Ä¶ not specifically from Vipassana though but from more prolonged meditation and spiritual practice\n\nWhat you've been through and are experiencing sounds absolutely awful, and I'm sorry to hear this was a consequence of you choosing such a healthy goal at such a young age. It makes sense that a full on retreat could cause such a shock to some folks' systems that it could trigger something like this.\n\nPlease, please jump through all the hoops you need to, to get referred for an appointment with a really good psychiatrist who can provide an excellent diagnosis, treatment, and follow up. And sometimes it's trial and error for a few years, unfortunately. No matter how many bariers you face, persevere until you can access good medical care, feel well and enjoy life again. Be willing to try a few medications, because good treatment could make all the difference. I wish you well!\n\nGo see a psychiatrist. As others have mentioned\n\nYou might want to look into what Willoughby Britton set up at [Cheetah House](https://www.cheetahhouse.org).\n\nCheck out [https://www.cheetahhouse.org](https://www.cheetahhouse.org) \n\nThey have a lot of knowledge about negative side effects of meditation and how to work with it and have done research on severe side effects of meditation and have developed practices to help those suffering such side effects.\n\nHey, you don't like being around loud people and loud circles,  you're  more aware of your thoughts.... so what? I don't think vipasana  fucked you up. There's  a high probability  you would have developed these traits inspite of you doing vipasana  mediation.  And you'll find a circle that you like being with. \nI think there's  this misconception  that life is easy after you start mediating, I think it's more the opposite . You kinda have to live with one eye open and it's  contradictory  and hypocritical . I also had a veryy difficult  year right after I first did my vipasana  retreat. I would encourage  you to talk to a person who's been doing vipasana  for a long time. \n Also I once heard somewhere that people who follow the yogic path or the path to enlightenment , burn their karmas  in a somewhat faster pace. And to burn your karma you have to experience  it , live  your misfortunes or your fortunes.\nAnd keep remembering  the principal; everything  is temporary,  and it too shall pass.\n\nSounds like \"true\" OCD even though that sounds crazy. You ruminating in that thought loop has been compounding this problem, I've been there too. I had such a hard time changing it, it went on for 3 years of misery before I found relief. By relief I don't mean I'm all of a sudden socially fluent or stop being awkward completely. It's more that I did a lot of internal work and just found more peace within myself and learned more how to separate myself from those thoughts. I also started supplementing with NAC and it sounds so fucking cheesey but I started doing work with my heart chakra and it made a HUGE difference.\n\nLook up spiritual awakening. A lot of people go through a similar situation: \n\n-Feeling disconnected or detached from your old self, routines, and things you used to enjoy. You may reevaluate your beliefs and feel like you don't fit in anymore.\n\n-Heightened intuition and increased awareness/sensitivity to your surroundings. \n\n-Going through emotional upheavals like mood swings, anxiety, irritability as well as waves of blissful feelings.\n\n-Physical symptoms such as fatigue, buzzing sensations, ringing in the ears, hypersensitivity to light/sound, and unexplainable aches and pains.\n\n-Letting go of attachments to material things and the ego. You start living more in the present moment.\n\n-Developing the urge to make significant life changes to align with your new sense of self and purpose, even if others don't understand.\n\nIt's important to note that everyone's spiritual awakening journey is unique. These symptoms can manifest differently for each person and may fluctuate in intensity over time. The key is to embrace the process, trust your intuition, and seek support when needed.\n\nIf people are suggesting you see a psychiatrist during your spiritual awakening, it's important to consider their perspective while also trusting your own inner guidance. Here are some key points to keep in mind:\n\n- Others may misunderstand what you're going through. Family and friends unfamiliar with spiritual awakenings may mistake the signs, like mood swings, altered perceptions, and unconventional behavior, as symptoms of mental illness.Their concern likely comes from a place of love, even if misguided.\n\n- There are similarities between spiritual emergencies and psychosis. Experiences like ego dissolution, mystical states, and heightened sensitivity can resemble psychotic episodes. However, spiritual emergencies are often temporary and transformational, while psychotic disorders tend to be chronic.\n\n- Seeking professional evaluation may provide clarity. A psychiatrist or therapist knowledgeable about spiritual issues can help differentiate between a spiritual crisis and mental health condition.The right diagnosis ensures proper treatment. A spiritual therapist might be the best of two worlds. They can evaluate if you have any mental health patterns with an understanding of how awaking to spirituality can mimic them. \n\n- Spiritual and clinical approaches can co-exist. Even if diagnosed with a mental health issue, it doesn't negate the validity or importance of your spiritual journey. Medication and therapy may create stability, enabling you to better integrate the spiritual aspects of your experience.\n\nTrust yourself while staying open-minded. You know yourself best. If something feels intuitively right, follow that inner compass.At the same time, consider others' concerns and be willing to seek help if your well-being seems at risk. There's no shame in addressing mental health alongside spiritual growth.\n\nThis happened to me when I thought meditation would be better than therapy. Find a therapist who doesn‚Äôt care about the diagnostic aspect. Try Yoga. 8 fold path. Yamas and niyamas. You control your thoughts through discipline. Get an Ayurvedic consultation. You have an unhealthy vata. You‚Äôll want to reduce certain foods and increase others. Don‚Äôt give up, and try natural remedies before unnatural is my recommendation.\n\nIt took me well over 10 years to find the right therapist because I didn't realize that there are some mental injuries that require someone who has specialized training, more than your average counselor. Please take the advice of some of the other posters and reach out to someone who specializes in the rather unique injury you sustained before you give up on therapy entirely. (Also, becoming a monk isn't about running away from life. It's about embracing it wholeheartedly.) Blessings to you.\n\nHey there, sorry to hear about your experience. Meditation can be a profoundly beneficial experience, but it sounds like the opposite occurred due to fixation on thoughts, and an overall lack of control on the mind. I often think Gurus and other spiritual leaders tend to use Meditation and spiritual practice as a kind of panacea to everything these days. No doubt there are real cognitive and emotional benefits from regular practice, but I think we need to be honest as human beings that life is complicated, emotions are complicated, and finding happiness and inner peace is a constant quest.\n\nMy recommendations are: \n\n1. Try to exercise regularly\n\n2. Continue meditation but limit to 15-30 minutes.\n\n3. Keep a Journal and record what is going on in your life, what is affecting you in your day to day. It will hold you accountable to the things you need to do, and what you want out of your life.\n\n4.  Seek Therapy and/or join sports clubs/meetups.\n\n\\~ I moved to a new city about a year ago, and felt a big weight of social anxiety, not feeling like I belong in this world. What helps is to make a habit of bieng with people through sports or volunteer work. It may feel uncomfortable, but if you have the time, I highly recommend for your own self development.\n\n  \nLastly, I would say, It's easy to regret your decision to do vipassana, but it could be the case that these difficulties you are experiencing could have materialized into something worse. If anything, meditation may have unlocked some past trauma, or lack of fulfillment you may have always faced, and the silver lining is that you finally can see yourself for what you are. Don't be too hard on yourself, We all go through different things whether we want to admit it or not, There is always a way out of your negative experiences if you are willing to take action.\n\n  \n\\~Cheers.\n\nI have never experienced what you are experiencing, but there is a possibility that you are experiencing a psychotic break.  This could be schizophrenia or some type of schizoaffective disorder.  You need a psychiatrist that can help you sort this out.\n\nSee a psychiatrist, sounds like schizophrenia\n\nHave you seen a psychiatrist? Psychosis can often be triggered by drug use or other events your brain experiences as trauma. You may need medication to help rebalance your brain chemicals. Don‚Äôt give up!\n\n22 now, meditating since 14 with various different spiritual practices.\n\nI find that as long as I stay away from drugs I don‚Äôt have psychosis. When I did a vipassana retreat I had done too many drugs too recently to the retreat, and I didn‚Äôt have many issues during the retreat, but definitely experienced issues thereafter although not straight up psychosis. However before this having done many spiritual practices and paths and smoking too much weed I had many many psychotic episodes.\n\nWhat worked for me was taking a little break from certain more advanced styles of meditation and doing the following.\n\nEating healthy, drinking LOTS of water\nGetting sunlight daily\nStaying on a daily routine/sleep schedule\nThroughout the day being present, but calm\nZhan Zhaung is very calming and balancing\nExercising daily\nTaking long periods of time just literally doing nothing, trying to calm down, and know myself \n\nAlso, Fasting for me personally was beneficial\n\nI don‚Äôt think there is anything wrong with wanting to be alone or not wanting friends. If you have no one you find your age who is into the same things you are or are very interesting people then that‚Äôs fine in my opinion. If people find you frustrating or difficult or socially inept that could be your problem or theirs. If you try to look at the situation objectively, is it their limited perspective that doesn‚Äôt allow them to see that people can socialize and relate in ways that are not familiar to them? Or are you truly weird/awkward? Being a quiet person does not make you weird or awkward, although might make other people uncomfortable, because you are present, aware, and quiet, and that might make someone who is low vibration or with anxiety, uncomfortable.\n\nYogis and mystics discover and analyze for themselves their experiences of their mind and body and try to find harmony based on what they experience. In my experience I find that my mental state is connected very closely with my posture. 3 things that have hugely helped me to maintain good posture and feel healthy mentally (posture is very connected to your digestive and overall health)  is weightlifting, specifically deadlift, rows, and face pulls for posture, yoga (ashtanga-vinyasa yoga) is best style of yoga for posture and body alignment, and zhan zhaung. The combination of these three will make you feel like your body is that of a newborn I swear.\n\nNote how you feel mentally, then after practice.. \n\nTry doing this full yoga sequence: \nhttps://youtu.be/ieGKuv605sE?si=qq9I395ui7YgbNRI\n\nAnd then 10 minutes Zhan Zhaung after:\nhttps://youtu.be/LxXoCSZ8aM0?si=G3dYkgTS_O2ThcVU\n\nNote again how you feel mentally. \n\nI really hope all this helps you!!\n\nwrench glorious spotted insurance aware placid brave act childlike sulky\n\n *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev)*\n\nAs someone else also mentioned: exercise. Do consider seeing a psychiatrist in the case it‚Äôs a more serious condition as others have said, but whatever the case, you need to get out of your mind and remain grounded. Exercise releases the necessary chemicals and neurotransmitters you need to remain grounded and keep your focus on the body/external world. As for your thoughts, don‚Äôt judge them, don‚Äôt form opinions about them, don‚Äôt analyze them, just return to the breath or some external object but don‚Äôt strive to do this just leave them alone. Also, stop telling yourself this whole story. Have some compassion for yourself, adopt a positive attitude and things will start to change.\n\nThere is a podcast called the retreat where they talk about vippassanna mediation causing psychosis in young adults. None of the people in the podcast had schizophrenia. Maybe you could contact the reporter and they can point you in the direction to get help.\n\nDid you take anything on the retreat? Sounds like drug psychosis\n\nI did one of those 10-day intensive. The application included a lot of screening questions. Sometimes people are not completely forthright in their answers. Ten days silent retreat is not for everyone.\n\nPerhaps grounding stuff like weightlifting,gardening, cookin, nature hikes,working with your hands may help. Kettlebell is very affordable equipment wise.\n\nAnd if there is anythjng at all that you even slightltly enjoy,thats a clue. Follow up on it.\n\nAs regards meditative practise,maybe none or tai chi,yoga, Feldenkrais can sometimes help to reconnect with the physical world. Or kirtan which can be social and soothing\n\nSome socialising around a common pirpose can be easier and more rewarding like community garden or help out elderly.\n\nBasically you got kicked out to Jupiter and need to journey back to earth.\n\nI agree that seeking professional medical help is a good idea. Though I just wanted to share my opinions on how vippassanna is typically taught in retreat settings. \n\nI always think about vippassanna like doing squats. Squats are a great exercise, they train lots of muscles, require skill, athleticism, focus etc. But they are just part of a complete, balanced, training program. If all you ever do is squat you're gonna end up with imbalances. If you have little to no athletic ability and go to a 10 day squat retreat, your gonna get injured.\n\nDoing a 10 day vippassanna retreat from a dead start is dangerous IMO. The notion that an venture must be hard in order to be worth while is baked into the retreat structure, and while I'm generally a fan of rigor I believe it often comes from an unhealthy place. This is not OP's fault, I'm pointing at problems I see culturally in capitalist work ethic that is reflected in the way we teach meditation.\n\nEssentially, we all understand rather intuitively that performing a single physical exercise for 10 days straight and then only ever performing that exercise is a recipe for problems. Why don't we make the same assumptions for mental exercises? Most of the research on physical exercise shows that almost all the health benefits are gained from modest practice (1 hour of weight lifting per week, 40 minutes of running etc) And we know over use injuries plague athletes who train rigorously in pursuit of performance. So why don't we teach meditation that way, as something that works best with 15 minutes a day?\n\nMore is more is a mistake that appears in too many places. And if we internalize the teachings of mediation practices, rather than getting absorbed in the pursuit of achievement of performance than I believe we might encourage mediation in a very different way.\n\nHey buddy. First off all, proud that you found space to reach out. As someone that has autism and adhd, tried an 3 days meditation retreat and is constantly aware (hearing, seeing and feeling my thoughts all the time), i think searching for psychiatric help might benefit. It may give you tools in how to learn to cope with your thoughts being as intens as they are(but to be honest it might not help you, this is based on my own experiences). \n\nI recognize the ‚Äúneed‚Äù to just run away and be a monk and to just live in the most basic form. And im certainly not telling you not to. But it sounds to me that you becoming more aware of a lot put a little to much ‚Äústress‚Äù on your mind. And that might cause you to spiral a bit. Thats because i experienced a same situation after my retreats. Before my thoughts where always on (like in sounds, active monologes, etc) but after it switched to actually seeing and feeling them. Accompanied by the thoughts volume turned to the max so too speak. Experienced lots of panicattacks afterwards, and therapie + EMDR helped me with dealing.  \n\nYou are making and taking steps in becoming more aware. Just realise that that is oke, and that asking for help is a sign of strenght. Hope I could help a bit and that its not too confussing üòÖ\n\nFew major points\n\n\n\n1. Sounds like mental illness, mental health issues, + trauma.  However since I am not a professional I would say seek out a psychiatrist + psychotherapist. \n2. Cheetah House is a great resource since they have experience with these issues for people having issues coming off retreats and experiencing a wide array of psychological issues. \n3. Refrain from dry insight practices outside of those taught by a qualified teacher whom you trust. A qualified teacher would likely not insist you perform dry insight practices at this time. \n4. Daniel Ingram and I hesitate to bring Daniel Ingram up since he can be a double edged sword. He has very useful pointers however you may get lost in his work. \n\nHowever two helpful pointers he has given out  were applying the \"thoughts in the room technique\" + four brahmaviharas equally. \n\n\nLastly I do not think becoming a monk will help. Monk life may offer some simplicity but doesn't automatically shortcut traumas. Additionally some things in monk life can have doctrines or inflexibility at times (adherence to rules or particular lifestyle). While it can be stabilizing to practice with lots of other monk practitioners retreating into isolation may not yield the successful result you seek. \n\nEven the Buddha always talked about the three jewels sangha. \n\nSangha doesn't only have to mean going to some monastic house. It's finding a group of people or people who you can connect to or support you.\n\n\nThe Buddha talked about the middle way. For you though since your case seems serious I would recommend something like Cheetah House.\n\nTake care\n\nI swear down people are nuts jumping to conclusions like @SCHIZOPHRENIA@\nJeeesus OP just highlighted a symptom, I mean the amount of various issurs that overlap symptoms, could be anything from social anxiety to OCD to whatever. But damn guys , directly going for the good old ‚Äúschiz‚Äù‚Ä¶give OP a break man\n\nThe same thing happened to me. You can call it obsessive mindfulness. It ended up being existential OCD and is very treatable. There‚Äôs actually an organization called Chetah House that specializes in helping people that develop mental issues from meditation. I advise you reach out to them.\n\nI have been trying to ‚Äúfit in‚Äù to society for a while after one of these too. It was one of a few things that really shook up my life, but in ways I wanted. I wasn‚Äôt functioning well at the time anyways.\n\nMy perspective is, it might not be a bad thing for you to become a monk. Maybe just embrave the process. It seems like something new is happening, but you don‚Äôt have to lose your autonomy in it. You can be whatever kind of monk or person you eant to be. There is no obligation to fit into society.\n\nHowever, influence of the social environment is very strong for human animals‚Äô biological systems. So it can feel like being a fish out of water being a sane person in a pretty strange world, and you can start to wonder if maybe you are the problem.\n\nCurrently I am seeking a far simpler way of life.\n\nI think my main mental health struggle was recently wading through all my possessions in my apartment. Finally I got all my stuff to a storage unit, trying to move to a more rural place suited for spiritual influences. I feel so free now. Like a new person. Like I can think again. I feel like I want to keep them in storage for years, slowly use or whittle them away or give them away, refining down to just what I need in life.\n\nSomething I learned doing a mini vision quest recently for myself in the woods for one night: I think it will really help me to step back from society and just relax, try to get an outside perspective. It‚Äôs an interesting time to be alive to say the least. I think we could all use some respite from the stimulation‚ÄîI don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs natural.\n\nI think you would benefit from more spiritual community‚Äîa downfall of the retreat system is there‚Äôs maybe not as much aftercare and support as there could be going back. \n\nIt has been hazy for me integrating that experience too. You are not alone.\n\nI think you‚Äôre doing great to seek help here. I would say trust yourself, and SERIOUSLY, from my experience, find community and make it a priority. People with similar experiences or perspectives, maybe explore some spiritual philosophies to help you understand‚ÄîI have been finding this INVALUABLE lately. Presence is great, but there‚Äôs this old way of thinking that is just like, what???? And I think it helps to integrate the two, help to understand the mental and social worlds from a spiritual or philosophical perspective to see how they fit together.\n\nAnd I think you have options. You can have a gf if you want one day, maybe you just need some alone time. I feel similarly. For me I conceptualize it as knowing I have had a lot of trauma and used to seek sex and relationships out of compulsion, trying to appease a nearly unconscious and seemingly insatiable loneliness.\n\nI also would not recommend going to a psychiatrist. Unless you really want to. Maybe one with experience in spiritual experiences could be of service, and I‚Äôm sure they are out there. I just don‚Äôt feel like meds are the solution.\n\nThere‚Äôs a podcast out too on people with similar experiences, could have some helpful resources, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs enough to discount the whole retreat thing. Lots of people benefit a lot from it. Sometimes it has strange outcomes.\n\n‚ÄúSuppose, monks, a man wants a snake, looks for a snake, goes in search of a snake. He then sees a large snake, and when he is grasping its body or its tail, the snake turns back on him and bites his hand or arm or some other limb of his. And because of that he suffers death or deadly pain. And why? Because of his wrong grasp of the snake.\n\n‚ÄúSimilarly, O monks, there are here some foolish men who study the Teaching; having studied it, they do not wisely examine the purpose of those teachings.‚Äú\n\n[source here](https://www.buddhistinquiry.org/article/alagaddupama-suttathe-discourse-on-the-snake-simile/)\n\nI find it helpful to understand not only the teachings better, but also common misinterpretations. (As well as maintaining my own thoughts and autonomy outside of them, not taking them dogmatically or even considering myself a Buddhist. They are just an interest for me). \n\nNagarjuna said, \n\n&gt; By a misperception of emptiness\n\n&gt; A person of little intelligence is destroyed. Like a \n\n&gt; snake incorrectly seized\n\n&gt; Or like a spell incorrectly cast. \n\n\n-MMK, Ch. 24, Jay L. Garfield translation (a great chapter and influential chapter that I have found helpful, can provide pdf if needed as it can be hard to find online. Of course your solutions might not be Buddhist, and I also find it helpful to sort of understand the Buddhism I have absorbed to help to integrate it :)).\n\nLook into Avoidant Personality Disorder. It can be comorbid with social anxiety disorder, general anxiety disorder, and/or OCD. Your story isn‚Äôt specific enough for any real diagnosis and I wouldn‚Äôt try to give a hard diagnosis of any kind anyway. Just some paths to travel down to see if they take you anywhere useful. I know a lot of people here are suggesting schizophrenia and that is a possibility but I think it is less likely than AvPD, PTSD, C-PTSD. I‚Äôm not sure that meditation is the culprit since much of this kind of psychological material can manifest into a disorder in people‚Äôs 20s. Likely meditation just opened your awareness to what was already there under the surface. If there is any history of physical, sexual, or emotional trauma from your childhood, meditation can activate those experiences in the body and the mind if the meditation is not led in a trauma-informed way. My recommendation is to try and find a trauma-informed therapist specifically and to meet with a psychiatrist for medication to alleviate some of the most troubling symptoms at least in the short term so that you can build out from a place of stability. I do not recommend self medication through weed, alcohol, or psychedelics. They will likely make things worse in your case. Exercise is an excellent remedy for intrusive thoughts and uncomfortable feelings. The point is not to push the feelings away, but to give them an outlet. Physical exertion is great for that. May you be well and find the understanding and compassion that will lead you to a lighter and freer place in your life.\n\nBook a consult at Cheetah House | Dr. Willoughby Britton researches symptoms like this and her organization supports meditators who have had similar experiences. The data shows your experiences are more common than anyone in the mindfulness industry is willing to admit. Dr. Britton is a neuroscientist and a licensed clinical psychologist; she is also a trained somatic experiencing practitioner (SEP). And she is the world‚Äôs foremost expert on meditation and adverse effects.\n\nGet to a psychiatrist.\n\nSounds like you had a ‚ÄúPsychotic Break‚Äù at 20yo following the Vippasana Retreat!!! Professionally, it does not sound like the Retreat was the culprit, rather just the ignition to your experience of Mental Illness!!!\n\nYou may be right here. It wasn't a good idea to do it and especially with no prior experience. I did it mainly because I wanted to be seen In a certain way, I never had a particularly good image of myself, but I think my mental health was more integrated before, like I say I had friends and a gf. \n\nI do feel as though doing this retreat unsaddled my mental health somewhat, and deffinetly more sensitive/nervous/worried about things\n\nDid you keep meditating after the retreat? Or did that one retreat still have negative effects on you 10 years later?\n\nget into law of assumption. ive always been aware of my thought processes like this. i realized i could use it for my benefit. and after a while you come to a point where you only believe the good thoughts so you dont overthink anymore. dont be afraid darlin remember youre not your thoughts\n\nSo after reading many of the comments on this I had to say something. I‚Äôm a mental health therapist. Yes it probably would be a good idea to see a therapist (someone who is familiar with trauma), a psychologist or psychiatrist. Usually best to start with a therapist so they can identify if you need further assistance from a psychiatrist or psychologist. Just know that if you go to a psychiatrist they are more than likely going to want to place you on some sort of medication bc that is what their main focus is. They don‚Äôt generally do any therapy with you so they would essentially diagnose you and prescribe you a medication. No Dr. whether a psychiatrist or neurologist knows everything, keep that in mind. They are only as good as the education and experience that they have in the field which can vary from Dr. to Dr. \n\nI would say you more than likely have experienced a level of awareness that you were not used to and it freaked you out. Which potentially could cause you to experience some trauma. This is because the identity that you knew yourself to be before this experience and your identity after are completely different. You‚Äôre seeing the world and yourself in a whole new way! The reason you don‚Äôt feel comfortable around people like you did before is because you‚Äôve experienced something they haven‚Äôt so it‚Äôs hard for them to understand why you‚Äôre thinking the way you are and it‚Äôs hard for you to understand why other people don‚Äôt understand you or why everyone seems so different to you now. Yes, you may be experiencing some OCD type tendencies but with some help from the correct therapist you should be able to get a handle on it. You can think of it as your brain recalibrating itself after having had such an experience, which I suspect hasn‚Äôt been all bad!\n\nHi Bomblewix93, Why don't you just embrace yourself and become a monk in the Theravada tradition. \n\nDo you think you may have found your calling at the retreat? It is a possibility. I think if psychologists cannot help you, you should seek out the help of trained meditation practitioners. They may be able to guide you.\n\n&gt;the voices in my head louder and more 'real' somehow. I became unable to distinguish my thoughts from reality.\n\nHonestly this sounds a little like PTSD. You know, like how war veterans hear fireworks and their brain puts them on the battlefield? Maybe that retreat stirred up some deep dark stuff in you.\n\nBe gentle with yourself! You seem to be creating an unrealistic standard for yourself then you talk down to yourself when it can't be accomplished.\n\nIn case you haven't heard it lately, you are amazing and deserve to have the best life possible.\n\nThere's no shame in being a monk if that is the life that calls to you when you are honest with yourself, and ask what you truly want with an open heart. However if you are becoming a monk out of resignation, it will likely be a grueling experience.\n\nAs someone who has severe PTSD his description doesn't really sound anything like PTSD.\n\nThat's a very interesting point. Could you elaborate on it further?\n\nParanoia isn‚Äôt typically a symptom of PTSD. The hallucinations can be, but the paranoia isn‚Äôt. These symptoms align more with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, especially with sudden onset in the early adult years.\n\nI am a fellow (C)PTSD sufferer with a degree in psychology and over a decade of nursing experience. The anxiety and depression OP describes feels familiar but the paranoia does not.\n\nTrauma, and therefore PTSD, comes in all shapes and sizes. We really can‚Äôt say whether this was a traumatic experience for the OP, but I wish you all the best in resolving your trauma. &lt;3\n\nNot everything is \"trauma\" and not all upsetting events cause PTSD.  What OP described is not the type of event that triggers PTSD nor does his description detail any aspects of PTSD.  Diagnoses exist for a reason, and this attempt to separate all labels and diagnoses from their actual meaning and criteria harms those who actually have these conditions.  It also makes it so people with serious mental health issues aren't taken seriously.  \n\nThere are diagnostic criteria to be met in order to be diagnosed, and multiple sessions with a licensed psychologist are required in order to figure out someone's whole story and what is going on with them.\n\nNo one is saying this but sounds like maybe you have just gotten the calling to be a monk.  If you don't want to continue on this path idk I'd suggest shrooms but the sub seems to think you're schizophrenic so idk.  What you're describing doesn't sound like the meditation I'm familiar with necessarily but I do think intense extensive meditation can simulate the effects of hallucinogens which does seem similar to what you're describing.  Rumination isn't healthy and most folks use meditation to escape that, however, if you feel you've truly seen the light and want to become a monk it seems like maybe you should do that? I do think most monks follow some type of spiritual practice but I don't know enough to speak on that but curious how your relationship with a higher power would play into becoming a monk.\n\nIf you can‚Äôt differentiate what is real and what is thought, are experiencing paranoia and the urge to isolate yourself, i doubt its a good idea to take any psychoactive substances. Especially not something strong like shrooms. \n\nWhat im assuming op needs, is a way to anchor himself back to reality. They probably wont become their old self again, but they could become a new one that is healthy or as healthy as possible. I think a good psychiatrist and maybe medication might be a good way.\n\nCan you explain more about your \"pshycosis\". and how do you unable to distinguish my thoughts from reality? \n\nwhen you say \"reality\", what kind of stuff do you defined as \"reality\"? the external world? thoughts are silent thing?\n\nI don't think you have any problem. \n\nIn my case, I used to have \"psychosis\", because the more I meditated, the more Deja Vu I had, I could open my eye and  had a vision of stuff, and then later on this exact scene happened right in front of my eye, this repeated so often  to a point that I could't distinguish whether the stuff I just saw is \"reality\" or just vision.  In my case, I started to developed my \"vision\" ability. In your case, you might be developing your hearing ability, hearing voices.  When you have such \"side effect\", that means you are on the right path of pursuing enlightenment.  This side effect are supposed to show up on the way. You just have to ignore it and continue to live your life. otherwise, like me many years ago, I gave up practicing meditation. \n\nIf you do want to start another relation, consider finding someone who's into meditation, you will have more things in common. \n\nI didn't attend 10 day meditation, or vipassana.  So I have nothing to blame.  But I do have a similar social situation.  I do have \"friends\", but I never call them, hang out with them, even people I know from the Buddhist temple, I don't hang out with them, because I just like being quietly alone, doing my own stuff.\n\nDo you know about depersonalization and derealization?\n\nI believe I have been including both of these as subcategories within ‚Äúdissociation‚Äù generally.\n\nWould you like to share more for consideration?\n\nI sorry im just a little confused, it just doesn't seem like this should impact you ten years from now! Brain changes usually aren't permanent. Like how juggling gray matter returns to normal... If this was from a year this would make sense but I just cant see this hurting you 10 years from now. Are you doing anymore meditation practices?\n\nBtw the social ineptitude could be from the default mode network deactivation! I cant gaurantee this will improve your social skills obviously, but I suggest you try non directive meditation. Its a meditation specifically designed to activate the default mode network\n\nAnyway sorry this happened to you man, yea this sucks.\n\ntdcs: Is there more you were doing, default mode deactivation perhaps cause, non directive meditation aid\n\nI facilitate meditation group and highly recommend this simple light meditation \n\nLight Meditation PSL\nhttps://youtu.be/HYUaALgyrq0\n\nThese are religious practices &amp; shd be done carefully per se. Ask the person who did it to help u.\n\nTry inner engineering from sadghuru look it up bro\n\nHello! It's very interesting your relate. I webt through something like this but before vipassana. I did vipassana twice. \n\nBut i experienced this though time with thought processes in a place of retreat also. It was in nature and we were five people in there, far from civilization and there was this day when i just started to see images in my mind as if i had committed a crime, as if i had killed one of the persons there ~ one specific which i was unconsciously mad at. So i got really scared that i could do something like that and from this moment on my mind got catastrophic, it was just tragedies everywhere. I suspect that i have autism and i was in very stressful situations so i guess this can be a result of that... And I did vipassana in fact to try to deal with the mind, but it was even more infernal the thins i had to deal, a lot of absurds. \n\nWell, i don't know what exactly it is bc I'm looking for improvements in my financial thing also and can't afford yet a professional to assess me and confirm some diagnosis. But I'm a seeker and sometimes a finder... And also a believer (most of times) and the Jungian thing helps me a lot to deal with it like embracing the shadow aspects of the subconscious mind, as well the perspective of intrusive thoughts that combines with this access consciousness thing which i stud/practice that brings a energetic perspective based on new paradigms and brings the idea that 98% of our thoughts aren't really ours 'cause we're more psychics than we notice when we live in newtonian pradigm. So... I go on and on... Working on bringing light to it by self-knowledge. \n\nAnd if you want to talk with me more about these processes, call me on instagram, it's @vaziovibrante i work with access consciousness and tarot mostly\n\nIf you changed so much I think you should change your point of view also, I think that you still want to be in your 20s and refuze to understand that you‚Äôre mature enough to want other things. Being with your friends it is not always good but being alone can be, maybe that is how you grow and maybe you needed this more than you refuze to accept. You also said that you had a ‚Äúhealthy social life‚Äù and than you said that you were ‚Äúinsecure‚Äù and I think this two don‚Äôt work together. And your thoughts are louder because, maybe, you don‚Äôt live to your purpose. You wanted to be some tipe of person and now that your are you say that you are broken instead of saying that is good that you‚Äôre changed.\n\nHope you get better boss üôèüèª\n\nI did my first at 18. Now 33, still doing. It's really helped me. I guess it unearthed a potential mental disorder sitting at the surface. I suggest you see a competent Vipassana teacher. Also you don't be a monk to escape life. Being a monk is 100 times tougher. There's an audio book by ajahn chah, may be you wanna check that out to get insights into a monk's life. One must never go to a camp if they have serious mental issues. It's a very deep technique and if done without disclosures of your mental state and done wrongly can harm you.\n\nI feel similar it is very scary\n\nrandom question but you ever try running consistently? like daily?\n\nYour inner persona is getting conflicted with your outer persona. Ani maybe vipasana bought that shit out of you sooner than later.\n\nI opened a private conversation with you if you want to discuss it.\n\nGood thing you are aware that it messed you up.. what you have to do is fix it now‚Ä¶ you can try becoming a monk alot of people do that. But through deep reflection i think you‚Äôll be able to quiet your mind more, don‚Äôt let your thoughts control you, control your thoughts so you can have a quiet mind, accept and understand your thoughts and remember these thoughts are not you‚Ä¶ there are moments i am able to just let my thoughts quiet for a bit those moments are the best! \n\nAlso going to nature, relaxing on the grass will help ground you more, because your third eye is activated you need to ground, as well as heal your third eye. I went through a dark night of the soul recently, but ive been aware of spirituality for some years now. I like to research and learn more about the topic and religion, more of the esoteric side of religion as it gives me a sense of knowing because this reality can indeed be scary sometimes, but it‚Äôs okay there are 7 billion people on earth with me in the moment just living life, doing things. \n\nUsually when people ‚Äúawaken‚Äù they go through a jolt and feel off balance from who they were before, you really have to dig deep and find yourself, something I thought about was that the current me is a blank canvas now that im awakened i will piece myself together to who i want to become for the rest of my life... which is to be a loving, giving, happy, enjoys the little things and big things in life, have great personality that people enjoy, and just do things out of love, it will bring you great peace to you to know that you are touching the lives of people. Many people are mentioning you to see a psychiatrist help, i also think you should try to get back to yourself! I know you can!\n\nI listened to a podcast about people getting destroyed mentally from VIppassana retreats. I will try to remember the name. I‚Äôm sorry this happened to you.\n\nHave an ex that went through something similar in his late teens/early 20‚Äôs after a bad trip. He was hyper focused on what he felt and experienced post trip. Turned out he is bipolar and the incident induced symptoms. Men tend to experience symptoms earlier than women, but it also depends on outside factors. Regardless, seek therapy if you are able to do so, and find a good fit. Sometimes you have to go through multiple therapists. They focus on different modalities depending on their specialties eg Cognitive Behavioral, emotion focused, attachment therapy, etc. A therapist can diagnose and treat disorders, they cannot however prescribe medication, this is where a psychiatrist comes in. Meet with a therapist, see what they say, if they suggest seeing a psychiatrist for medication discussion then it‚Äôs up to you. If you meet with a psychiatrist initially, do not skip the therapy part. Psychiatrists are medical doctors that prescribe meds, they are not there to sort through our problems. Therapy is key. Meds can help calm the noise. Sending lots of strength to get through this.\n\nAs others have mentioned, I wonder if any therapist ever looked into schizophrenia as an underlying issue. \n\nWhether it is actually that or the vippassanna or something else might forever stay in the dark. You say that therapists have been focused on the 'cause' the 'diagnosis', have any of them worked with you on the symptoms? \n\nI'm not often a fan of treating symptoms instead of causes, but sometimes it can be more effective.\n\nWould almost suggest working with a Therapist/specialist to see if going through another vippassanna retreat might help you find silence. I'm no specialist, more of a Generalist out of an Holistic viewpoint. Feel free to send me a message if you'd like to go back and forth a little in regards to 'options'. I'm in the EU TZ.\n\nBorrowing a phrase from the Christian mystic Saint John of the Cross, these experiences are sometimes referred to \"a dark night of the soul.\" Distinguishing mental condition from mental illness is challenging work, even for trained clinicians. A misdiagnosis can even sometimes cause more harm than having no diagnosis. \nLike others, I encourage you to be cognizant about your present capacity, &amp; applaud your courage for asking.\n\nYou've mentioned the desire to become a monk.\nThis passage helps me reflect on how to balance using my passion while finding a purpose, so I'll share it here:\n\nAmidst seated mountains and whispering forests, there existed a serene monastery. Likened to a fortress of truth and wisdom, the sanctuary sheltered many who were weary, yet residents could stay or leave at leisure.\nAmong its inhabitants were Tarun, Abbot, Aarav, Dev, and others, embodying the myriad paths of life &amp; spirituality.\n\nFirst Monk: Eternal Resident\n\nBorn within the monastery's hallowed walls, Monk Tarun knew no other world. The sound of chanting monks was his lullaby, and the fragrance of incense was his morning air. Raised in the embrace of spiritual teachings, Tarun embodied tranquility and discipline.\n\nTarun's Daily Reflection: \"I am the river, flowing within these sacred confines. My path is clear, my purpose steadfast. The world outside is but a shadow of the divine light I find here.\"\n\nMonk Abbot: \"Tarun, do you ever wonder what lies beyond these walls?\" Tarun: \"No, Abbot. For within these walls, I find all that I seek. The world outside may tempt, but my heart is anchored in this sanctuary.\"\n\nSecond Monk: Seeker Beyond\n\nMonk Aarav, also born in the monastery, felt the pull of the world beyond its gates. Curiosity and a thirst for adventure coursed through his veins. One day, he bid farewell to his brethren and ventured into the unknown.\n\nAarav's Soliloquy: \"I seek the world beyond, not to escape the divine, but to find it in the mundane. Every path I tread, every face I meet, is a verse in the sacred scripture of life.\"\n\nTraveler: \"You wear the robes of a monk, yet you wander the world. Why?\" Aarav: \"Because the teachings of the monastery are the roots, and my journey is the branches reaching for the sky. I seek the divine in all forms, in every place.\"\n\nThird Monk: The Refugee \n\nDev came to the monastery seeking refuge from a tumultuous life. The peace she found within its walls was a balm to her weary soul. She chose to remain, immersing herself in the discipline and serenity the monastery offered.\n\nDev's Nightly Prayer: \"In this haven, I find the stillness my heart craves. The chaos of my past is a distant echo, and the serenity of now is my sanctuary.\"\n\nNewcomer: \"Dev, do you ever wish to return to your old life?\" Dev: \"The life I left was but a storm. Here, I find the calm, the purpose, and the divine whisper that guides my every breath.\"\n\nFourth Monk: A Wandering Sage\n\nMonk Kavi had neither home nor monastery. His life was a perpetual journey, each step a meditation, each breath a prayer. He was a monk in essence, his heart a temple, his mind a sanctuary. \n\nKavi's Evening Reflection: \"The world is my monastery. Every tree is a pillar, every sky a roof. I find the divine in the wind's song and the sun's embrace.\"\n\nVillager: \"Kavi, you have no home, no monastery. How do you find peace?\" Kavi: \"Peace is not a place, but a state of being. Wherever I go, I carry the temple within me. The divine is everywhere, if we only learn to see.\"\n\nLife happens in seasons my friend. Allow things to change, and observe your feelings. Be kind to yourself, make the necessary adjustments, and begin again.\n\nIn the end, it is not where we are, but who we are that defines our spiritual essence. Remember, your experience is valid, and seeking the right support and community can help you find your path.\n\nHello friend,\n\n I am sorry to hear of your suffering.\n\nI had a similar experience, not with vipassana but something else triggered similar symptoms in me when I was around 16. \n\nI hated my life and for years I was wondering how this could happen to me and if I would ever manage to be \"normal\". I am 28 now and in these last few years I realised that these symptoms which I considered a curse are actually a blessing.\n\nMy suffering has pushed me to improve inevery aspect of my life.  I still have not overcome it but now I acknowledge that without it, even though I was happy, I was so self centered and generally not a good person.  \n\nI don't know what the future will bring and if I ever manage to live free of such negative emotions but whatever comes I now know for a fact that this suffering has been the catalyst for positive growth in every aspect of my life. \n\nBottom line, I know that you feel like drowning but if you don't give up and keep seqrching for organic and sustainable ways make use of yout catalyst I am certain that one day you will be greatful for it.\n\nHey there,\nVipassana is an intense retreat designed to help separate the real You from all your worldly doings and trappings. It‚Äôs like a bird which has been in a cage since birth is now exposed to the world beyond the cage. It is freedom for some, but if you are not prepared the whole vast world beyond the cage can be overwhelming. Many prefer the comfort of the cage to such a freedom. \nMy suggestion would be to read books of other meditators, yogis who often share their own stories and processes, as it may help you get acquainted with your condition. You can also try meditating at home, as the conditions you describe are ideal to undertake inner journeys. If you want to get back to your ‚Äònormal‚Äô self , just remember nothing has been lost.. you have just observed your truth and accepted it; you could take help of a therapist as suggested by others.\n\nTried jhana, which is getting back in touch with your feelings. Good luck. May you find resolutions\n\nOne question is whether your problems might have developed without the retreat. You were at an age when some mental illness first begin to get noticeable. Don't take this as an insult, but rather than a therapist you might try an actual medically trained psychiatrist.\n\nNot just Vippassana but any meditation can lead to this sort of Psychosis. My brother in law really struggled with this at his 3 month monk internship you have to do in Thailand and it took him a good few years to get better.\n\nMy first suggestion is that I can‚Äôt advise on professional help but must suggest speaking with a psychiatrist or other doctor to see if this is something that requires medication.  \n\nIn terms of meditation (assuming all is in order otherwise) I would suggest that an inward approach focusing on the breath, perhaps with light breathwork, might help with the anxiety which in turn may help with paranoia etc. One important aspect of meditation for a lot of people is calmness, and I can‚Äôt imagine you feel all that safe with what‚Äôs going on in your mind. You mentioned you felt more aware of your thoughts but I wonder as well if there‚Äôs a lot of judgment of those thoughts as good or bad, which wouldn‚Äôt explain the voices but would explain some of the paranoia. I hope some of this helps.\n\nThe deeper you shine the light into your mind, the more ground is revealed. This doesn‚Äôt go away. The distractions your kind creates to keep you trapped in ego get harder to overcome.\n\nOn the other side of this, is a deeper and greater appreciation for your time and energy. That includes your friendship circle. In time, everything changes. Don‚Äôt be elitist about it. Everyone gets to the finish line, you‚Äôve just realised you are running the race now! \n\nif you feel a pull to be alone, do it - you will find many things inside. Ultimate reality is perceived through the windows of your eyes. You have the opportunity to go deep inside. I think what you‚Äôll find when you reach deep enough, is that you can perceive your own reality. But by yourself, it‚Äôs solitary. When you have others around you, you expand by speaking through and embodying the parts of your self. This is god experiencing god, your ultimate purpose here. \n\nDon‚Äôt leave any stone unturned, until you realise the stone need never move again\n\nWhy you  feel like anything  is wrong? Becoming a monk is not bad  thing.  There is one problem though.  Before you were burning karma of your past. Now  if you become a monk you will burn  karma of monk. They still have  some social life conditioned to their being. Monks also could dislike each other and etc. Your problem  is that you had pattern of someone. Means you didn't enjoy yourself  as unique human being. So the result frustrated you. But your story is useful pattern to others. To show the differences of influences  on  two human beings.\n\nMate, looks like you reached a greater level of self awareness and de problem might be the society itself and not even you. Now a days people are working just to fulfil materialist needs. \n\nI believe what may can help you to find again a meaning can be art in any kind or form (painting, drawing, singing, creating music, playing instruments), science and research (looking to answer meaningful questions).\n\nHave you been to a psychiatrist? I don‚Äôt think just regular therapy would solve it. It seems you developed some sort of psychosis or schizophrenic-like disorder\n\nMonks enjoy spending time with friends and meeting new people as well as being alone\n\nGoenka fucks a lot of people up!\n\nI‚Äôd encourage you to do the noting stuff and do some gentle grounding and centering meditations.\n\nTWIM is great. Tonglen. The brahmaviharas. Maybe some very relaxed concentration meditation on openness. Gentle vase breathing. More emphasis on emotions and subtle energies.\n\nThe thoughts aren‚Äôt really you, but you‚Äôre still subtly identifying with them. Bring your awareness down into your body, release and relax, get out of your head. There‚Äôs nothing you need to do about the thoughts.\n\nThere's a solid recommendation that is already consistently prevalent in the comments.  \n  \nI'm experienced in Vipassana and usually sit one 10-day, and server another retreat each year. After my first 10-day retreat, I followed the advice Goenka give in one of the last few discourses about not making any major decisions or act on anything major from whatever arose during the retreat . I did my first in Kelsyville, CA in 2012, and when it was through I couldn't wait to sign-up for another. I did the second one about four months later in Onalaska, WA. I only sat or served one in a year ,maybe 5 of the years, and when the pandemic came retreats weren't offered making most retreats since in high demand.  \n  \nI've missed the benefit of what a 10-day Vipassana retreat brings, which many describe as a well need reset from the bullshit of life.  It's like a training workshop that teaches how to exercise one's mind. A digital-detox is of course one part that anyone would understand, even if you don't know anything about meditation or Vipassana.\n\nIf you have any kind of practice meditating that is regular, even if it's only 5 minutes, that's the training people do running 5 miles every day, and it might go longer or shorts some days. Many do that training for that one big event, like full or half-marathon. That 10-day retreat is that half-marathon road race I look forward to and enjoy training for everyday. There a ton of benefits my body gets from all that exercise.   \n\nOP, you mentioned, specifically, \"I became unable to distinguish my thoughts from reality.\" Yikes, man. You definitely need to get that checked out. I can assure you though, that has nothing to do with Vipassana.\n\nRespectfully, I don‚Äôt think it was the Vippasanna that did this to you, by the sounds of it you were on course for a negative mental spiral no matter what. Hope you find some peace, man.\n\nDon't blame Vipassana.\n\nSo sorry that that's been happening to you, sending much love and compassion.\nThe closest thing with which I can relate is psychedelic drug induced DPDR Disorder (derealization in my case) which lasted a few months, experiencing severe surreality and detachment from the world, I thought I'd never be okay but here I am. Stay strong and seek help, my friend\n\nMaybe the resistance to became a monk makes you unhappy.\n\nWhen I was younger I would dream about leaving it all and becoming a monk. I probably would have done it too if I wasn't scared of letting go of attachment and embracing the unknown.\n\nNo one is going to be able to tell you what to do, and people are saying try a psychiatrist and this and that, sure... maybe that will help, but you've tried therapies and therapists. I dunno. \n\nI did a vippassana retreat in my mid twenties and I'm in my mid thirties now. It was a very intense experience. I went through such high highs and very low lows while their, but then again, I think that is the point of it. It's important to see the patterns of your thoughts, and doing so while essentially cut off from other people really sheds a light on your darkest places but also some of your brightest as well.\n\nI can't tell you what to do, and I don't think anyone else can. You need to do what is best for you. If you don't like who you are now, then maybe you should seek help. But, if you like who you are and it's only other people that seem to have a problem with who you are, fuck em. You are whats important and you will find people that like and love you for who you are. Or become a monk.\n\nAm I the only one who senses a tinge of megalomania in this text\n\nGo to your family doctor. Get a referral to a psychiatrist and a therapist.\n\nIm not a doctor or meditation instructor but i had psycosis when i was 20 or 21 and i thought i was going crazy. I was being more aware of my toughts and didint like it snd started to create cenarious in my head but i could not control that . I was trying my best to avoid this feeling cus it made me have the most exsistensial dread ever. But i didint want to be a scizo and i thought that wad happening to me so i started to think lf scizo as a concept that we made up literaly. Like at first its low and mellow but the more scared and you belive in it the more real it becomes. The power of the mind to create is more then we know and we can use it for good or get afraid and be lost in it. Might be a hot take but i just started observing all the scary thinkgs cuz there was either that or to die. But dying would just put pain on others and i didint want that.‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏èI suport you.\n\nHey there, keep your head up, you‚Äôve got this!\n\nI was diagnosed with psychosis at 21, and while I had been practicing meditation prior to, I didn‚Äôt practice when I was stabilizing on medications. \n\nSince becoming stable, I also went down the path of thinking becoming a monk and going on permanent retreat was the solid choice. Sadly this was the pendulum swinging from extreme to extreme and thinking removal from society would solve all my problems. Meditation has been life changing in this regard (after stability). I‚Äôve been able to utilize the hyper awareness you‚Äôre talking about to heal the parts that were wounded in the first place. I can also notice these pendulum swings and allow them to neutralize, so they affect me less. I guess I‚Äôm also a bit extreme and practice sometimes 3+ hours a day just to energetically maintain the mind/body. \n\nI do believe that seeing a professional can help, if that‚Äôs your path. Psychiatrist and a trauma informed therapist would be my recommendation. The trauma informed therapy piece is often overlooked due to mental health stigma and thinking that pills are enough. \n\nWishing you so much luck on your journey, and feel free to reach out if you need any additional guidance.\n\nThis isn‚Äôt negative‚Ä¶u had a kundalini awakening‚Ä¶\n\n\"No gf since I broke up with her shortly after the course\" \n\nBro according to you the course was 10 years ago... you haven't had a gf for a decade and you blame that on a meditation retreat? Something isn't adding up here people this post smells like BS to me.\n\nBro sorry you‚Äôre experiencing this. Keep faith, you‚Äôll recover, life will be brighter. \n\nMy experience: \n\nI went on a vipassana 4 years ago (I‚Äôm now 28), I had some crazy panic attack/complete meltdown which left me super super super traumatised / sensitive. It was so overwhelming I got a lazy eye + couldn‚Äôt fall asleep without getting headaches for over 3 years. \n- broke up with my gf, left England and lived in a village on the coast of Kenya for 2 years. \n- Nothing was helping me so I went back to my parents and live at home for a while but still progress was very slow at regaining my sanity. \n\nTried heavy shroom trips, all types of therapy, 2 hours+ of sitting per day, cold swimming etc etc - it‚Äôs been a hell of a journey and at some times I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd make it through. \n\nDm if you like to jump on a call, happy to share the things that really helped + you‚Äôre not alone in meditation seemingly fucking up life.\n\nSummary of what worked:\n- good friends\n- exercise (Calisthenics) \n- IFS is solid (it‚Äôs a type of therapy) \n- Therapy \n- trust that getting through this will mean you can get through anything\n\nConsult a specialist who knows about this tho first ofc - I‚Äôm just a random dude.\n\nJust a thought - you could be a ‚Äúhighly sensitive person‚Äù and completely normal. I am one and I discovered that my awareness of others feelings is just a part of who I am. \n\nEdit: apart from really understanding others feelings, HSPs also are in their head a lot more. HSPs need time by themselves to recuperate and process the stimuli they are exposed to. They often feel misunderstood and conscious of others. \n\nI am writing all of this because I see a lot of comments around psychosis and schizophrenia but there could be something else based on what you write. 20% of human population is HSP and they are just a bit different and think more deeply.\n\nplease talk to a psychiatrist.\n\nDo the free mbti test on the 16personalties wesite ! you can be the most introverted type. I almost cried when i found out i'd always been an intj - the most introverted type that hates socialising and small talk. Also do research on Loop and Grip. I also stumbled upon meditation and got myself into The situation. I used to be able to handle small talks, but now i value my alone time more - to Think. I was almost admitted to an asylum, after being diagnosed with schizo. I took schizo medication also, but it just made everthing worse. Please do the mbti test and  go straight to CS joseph youtube channel after. He'll tell you things that you dont even know about yourself. Introverts need time away from people to heal !\n\nTake magnesium if you don‚Äôt already do that. If it works, but not well enough, you‚Äôll need to go see a doctor to prescribe you medication for depression. Keep me updated please.\n\nThere is a syndrome called \"The India syndrome\". Something to read about!.\n\nAs a kid, I once had that type of feeling after watching a horror movie. I couldn't really tell what was happening, I thought the movie was real. I couldn't associate myself with real life people, sound or anything. My mind was all time occupied with horrors in the movie and all the things around me sound dimmed. It was a trauma that lasted for about a 2 week for me, thought I was going crazy. Then, someone told me it was all acting and nothing as such happens in the real world. That realization, slowly cleared my fear and I finally began to come to my senses. I think sometimes the realization and the knowledge help us.\n\nDon't blame a retreat for your own problems.\n\nHi OP, I am no expert, but there is a term called India Syndrome. \nThis is a copy and paste from Google, \n\n‚ÄúIndia Syndrome,‚Äù a psychosis said to effect Westerners seeking spiritual enlightenment in India, is identified as the cause behind a suicide and a disappearance of two Westerners drawn to India, and led astray there.\n\nI would say that given the roots of the practice this may very well be what you have experienced.\n\nPlease seek professional help if you are able to. There are practitioners out there with experience of this and who can help you.\n\nWishing you the best.\n\nThese comments saying psychosis and schizophrenia are ignorant minds and have no clue what they are talking about.\n\nIt‚Äôs not that you‚Äôve gone insane, this is part of awakening.\n\nYou just became aware of your thoughts which were dictating your life subconsciously.\n\nAnd your value have shifted from the societal norms. \n\nOne thing I would add to help is practice metta and unconditional love.\n\nAlso I would recommend you keep training and get into further meditation.\n\nYou have to play the game, walk the path in the middle, find a balance, going 100% the spiritual way will not help you in your karmic experience. We supposed to experience all kinds of things, as a monk you won‚Äôt. Just freaking realize this is just a game."

    "title": "How to destroy 98% of your social anxiety (Updated)",
    "body": "My last post that got hundreds of people saying they love it - got deleted because it had external meditation link.\n\nSo here's the post WITHOUT any particular links.\n\nPlus, i have updated it with additional thoughts and insights - I had from answering all the questions in the previous post.\n\n---\n\nWriting this out in practical steps to achieve near-complete removal of any forms of social anxiety. So that you can talk to anyone, anywhere - as if they've been your life long friend.\n \nDoing what I mention in the next few paragraphs will create instant rapport between you and strangers - allowing you to just talk and talk with whoever you want.\n \nNotes\n \nThis is NOT complete removal of anxiety. Not because it isn't possible. I do think it's possible to remove anxiety 100% of the way. It's just I haven't reached that stage yet. I still get that 2% of anxiety. Which I assume will go away in a few months.\n\nDoing this process requires some hard changes in your life, and your outlook in life. It's possible and entire segments of your life will change for the better once you start this.\n\nThis process took me nearly a year. Only because I had to find and piece everything together myself. However I reckon anyone can do it in 3-6months - given they follow the right steps with discipline.\n\nSo let's get started. Why am I sharing this? To help someone like me. I'd have desperately wished for guidance like this a year ago. But since there was no one to help me point the exact direction - I had to spend endless amounts of time in meditation practices and reading books on spirituality &amp; inner work.\n \nBefore you start this, there's a belief you need to 'adopt' - \"Life is loving and peaceful &amp; we're infinite beings with unlimited potential\".\n \nWe'll eventually go into advanced forms of beliefs but that's the universal belief that'll be the backbone of the work we do here.\n \nOkay so here are the 4 things you need-\n \nActive meditation practice (Both - one pointed meditation &amp; loving kindness)\n\nGoing through A Course In Miracles Lessons (At your pace)\n\nReading spiritual texts (Dr. David Hawkins, Bible, Bhagvad Gita, Eckhart Tolle)\n\nLetting Go &amp; Sedona Method (Practice Surrender 24/7)\n\nNow rest of the post will be expanding on the 3 things and going into detail about my experience and learnings...\n \nFirst things first, a meditation practice.\n \nA stable, consistent meditation practice is much needed. However this doesn't mean you need to do it EVERYDAY.\n \nTwo parts to this.\n \nFirst, seated meditation where you just focus on your breathing or w/e.\n \nSecond, practicing the Power Of Now (Eckhart Tolle) - where you fixate your awareness in the present moment 24/7. Ideally your inner body. The more you do it, the natural it gets.\n \nThese 2 things will help cultivate a form of stable attention that you can use to somewhat control your thinking mind.\n \nYour thoughts.\n \nOnce you start to have some level of mastery at it. (Just the seated meditation won't cut it)\n \nGoing through A Course In Miracles (ACIM) lessons becomes easier.\n \nThe whole point of ACIM lessons is to make the world benign. To transform the world you see. To detach you from your EGO so that you don't see the people around you as enemies, strangers or separate from YOU.\n \nNext practice on the list is Loving Kindness meditation.\n \nThanks to the EGO, all of us have negative self-talk inherently imbued in our psyche.\n \n\"I'm not worthy\", \"I can't do this or that\" etc.\n \nThe goal of loving kindness meditation is to practice self-love.\n \nI'm paraphrasing but there is a saying in The Kybalion that you can only get what you give out in life.\n \nThere's similar sayings in Bible and other texts but you get the point...\n \nIf you want to get love and kindness from others. You'll have to start with yourself. Start practicing loving kindness with your self.\n \n(Google for guided loving kindness meditations, you'll find tons)\n \nA supplement practice you can add is positive self-talk. Once you start catching yourself shaming or guilt-tripping yourself. Practice self-compassion.\n \nStart encouraging yourself. Treat yourself like someone you care for. (KEY)\n \nOvertime, your mind will start to help you - instead of hurting you.\n \nAdding prayer (twice daily) helps a ton. Praying out to GOD to help you through this process, to guide you to your highest self. (The content, the word's don't matter, your intention does)\n \nLast 2 things are Letting Go &amp; Advancing on the Spiritual Path.\n \nEveryone has their own paths in life. Pick up spiritual text and see what resonates with you.\n \nFor me, I started with Eckhart Tolle then heavily went into Dr. David Hawkin's texts.\n \n(Check for list below)\n \nThe goal of reading spiritual texts is to better understand your EGO &amp; your inherent Beingness aka 'I am' ness.\n \nOnce you start to catch your EGO in action, you'll start to detach from it.\n \nThat means previously what caused you fear won't affect anymore...\n \nLastly\n \nLetting Go.\n \nYou can either read the book Letting Go by Dr. David Hawkins or the Sedona Method by Lestor Levinson.\n \nSame thing, David learned it from Lestor.\n \nI find Lestor's stuff easy to do since it's more practical with the steps.\n \nHowever do read both.\n \nPracticing constant surrender 24/7. Once you start letting go frequently, the tensions that arise in your body will naturally start to fade away.\n \nThis is the biggest turning point.\n \nFinale\n \nOnce you have done most of the stuff listed above for a few weeks.\n \nSit down. Visualize yourself approaching and talking to strangers...\n \nSee what sensations come in your body.\n \nIn your gut or your chest.\n \nFocus completely on them and practice Letting Go.\n \nDo it multiple times a day if you can. Since it barely takes a few minutes lol.\n \nMultiple times a week.\n \nOnce the feelings are gone. Or not noticeable.\n \nStart going out and talking to people. You'll see that about 10-20% fear still pops up.\n \nLet go at that exact moment.\n \nThis is why practicing Power of Now helps so much.\n \nOnce you're used to having your awareness in your body. You can easily catch your sensations and emotions that arises.\n \nThe thing is, 1 emotion = 1000000000 thoughts.\n \nYou can't work through the fear of anxiety in your mind.\n \nYou have to let go of the emotion.\n \nOnce you do that, you're FREE.\n \nYou know what's funny. You can do it for ANYTHING in your life that you fear. Or anything that triggers you. Your trauma etc.\n \nVisualize the negative situation.\n \nSee the emotion.\n \nWelcome it. No judgements.\n \nLet it go.\n \nRepeat.\n \nMisc Stuff-\n \nYou likely will have some limiting beliefs, that I recommend you start doing shadow work on. Write them down. Start with the question of 'Why I can't do X' then write don't all the reasons that pop up. Don't filter. Accept them. Overtime as you start to question your limiting beliefs - you'll start to see them for what they are. Illusion. You'll be free to have healthy empowering beliefs. Your inner state is completely in your control...\n \nNotes:\n \nRemove all forms of judgement. Whenever you catch yourself judging - say that I don't judge.\n\nPractice self-compassion and love to yourself and others.\n\nMy recommended books - Power vs Force, Power of Now, Power of Love. (Lol crazy coincidence with the naming pattern)\n\n\nUpdated Thoughts\n\nAll of the above is what worked for me. \n\nEverything written is based off first hand experience. \n\nYour path might be slightly or completely different. \n\nUse this post simply as a guiding post.\n\nAdditionally, we all have certain negative habits we pick up in our childhoods - for me, it was people pleasing and some other stuff. Which took a lot of trauma healing, shadow work, acceptance and letting go. Recognise what it is for you and let go of it to be a better, improved version of yourself.\n\n\nLastly, if you don't consider yourself a person that read's books (another one of ego's labels) then you're going to have a hard time with this. The greatest teachings are in the books I have mentioned below. Just this post won't suffice. Take your time and do the work. The rewards on the other side is worth it.\n\n\nExpected Roadblocks\n\nThere are 3 major roadblocks you'll face:\n\n1. Resistance\n\n2. Unconsciousness\n\n3. Judgement\n\n\nResistance is an emotion. It's a kind of mental thing we have the habit of doing unconsciously. It impedes progress. You'll find resistance mostly everywhere as you start this journey. Look out for it. Resistance to what is, resistance to certain emotions and lastly even resistance to resistance.\n\n\nResistance stems from unconscious judgementalism. I had it. You likely have it. Accept resistance. Let it be there. And it'll pass.

Stuck in your thoughts and stories. Never fully here. Be easy on yourself. Start being present in easy scenarios. When no one is around. Once you get used to it, focus on being present when you're doing activities. Then the next stage would be being present in your body while talking to people. It's a series of progression. It helps to have reminders around your homes as books or paintings or whatever to bring your attention to present moment.\n\n\nThird, judgement. Judgement arises from the EGO. Judgement creates positionalities. There's no here or there without judgement of what is. There is no me and you without judgement. Whenever you find yourself judging let go of it. It'll take time but it'll improve how present your are in the moment. Don't judge others. Don't judge yourself. We all do what we think is right or a few quotes from bible - \"Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother's eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye?\" \n\n\nIn psychological terms, we project on others what we don't like in ourselves. Be aware of why you're doing certain things, and you'll find more of your shadow self you have been avoiding.\n\n\n\nReading Materials - In no particular order\n\nPower vs Force (David Hawkins)\n\nEye of I (David Hawkins)\n\nI: Reality &amp; Subjectivity (David Hawkins)\n\nPower Of Now (Eckhart Tolle)\n\nPower Of Love (Lestor Levenson)\n\nAwake!

    "all_comment_text": "this gave me anxiety\n\nwhy?\n\n[removed]\n\nRoflü§£\n\n[removed]\n\nwell if you want a magic bullet solution there's always drugs and alcohol \\s\n\nYeah then you‚Äôll have 10x as much to worry about down the road\n\nfr haha\n\nHere is the short course for the secular and/or science minded:\n\nBe present, be authentic (learn about self and therefore all humans), be realistic (learn about how reality is, including one's place in it).\n\nMixing religion and science usually makes a mess of both. This OP's verbose post is such an example. Worst part of it is prompting a switch from negative to positive, as in the example of the stranger or the unknown.  How about recognizing neutral as a worthy value? The unknown is factually and logically neutral precisely because it is unknown, as in yet to be determined.\n\nHere‚Äôs an even cleaner version, thanks chat gpt:\n\nThe post‚Äôs unique approach to social anxiety:\n\nCore practice: Constantly let go of negative emotions as they arise\n- Notice anxiety or fear in your body\n- Allow the feeling without judgment\n- Choose to release it\n- Repeat this 24/7, especially in social situations\n\nSupporting practices:\n- Daily meditation\n- Self-love exercises\n- Studying spiritual texts\n- Gradual exposure to social situations\n\nThe author emphasizes this continuous emotional release as the key to transforming social anxiety, framing it as a spiritual practice rather than just a psychological technique\n\nInteresting. I don't consider emotions in either positive or negative terms. It is an artificial construct, a judgement that I think makes more confusion, not less. All emotions have value when they are appropriate. To recognize when they are not appropriate and do something about that is the key. And make no mistake, your \"positive\" emotions can be just as inappropriate as your \"negative\" ones. Your shorter psychological technique suggestion would work just as well as the OP's longer spiritual practice one would. I just prefer an even shorter, clearer way.\n\nYea, I agree that emotions do not require judgements. That said, the judgement is like a phobia of sorts, and the suggestion is just labeling them to acknowledge that we‚Äôre fearful of certain ones. Through exposure and presence they lose their power.\n\nTo be fearful of emotions is to be fearful of self, creating a \"prisoner is the jailer\" arrangement that corresponds directly to a distortion of impressive magnitude rather like an echo chamber. \n\nJudgement has its place as a tool. We all judge; some with discernment, most with all manner of distortions. \n\nEliminating the distortions also eliminates inappropriate feelings such as fear when there is no threat. Your method is for getting used to those \"negative scary\" feelings, mine is for transmuting them into what they are meant to be and using them accordingly.\n\nI don't think it's possible to exist without judging others or the self.\n\nwhy not?\n\nbut yes, you're somewhat right. as long as the ego exists, judgement will always be there. it's what the ego does.\n\nJudgements are just thoughts about the character of someone or something and it isn't possible to interact mentally with anything without thoughts about that subject arising. You can just observe something but as soon as you begin to add descriptors, it's over.\n\non point\n\nwhat is you opinion on anger? Of all emotions this one seems the most inappropriate. As in there are very little situations where being angry actually helps you or others.\n\n\nIn my experience the person who is angry always needs to calm down first to resolve the situation.\n\n\nI can see anger helping in physical situations but even then: so many people get angry in non-physical issues so my question is focused on this - more common - case\n\nI think all emotions have value, including anger. When channeled appropriately, anger energizes for action because it is designed for that. Because of my journey and the condition\\*\\* I live in, I seldom experience anger. I agree with you in there is far too much anger happening with most of it being terribly and often tragically mishandled\\*.\n\n\\*That said, I believe all emotions may be variations or subsets of two: love and fear. Anger is a form of fear. If one can identify what the fear is, the anger becomes much easier to handle appropriately, especially if the fear is run through something akin to the Serenity Prayer where things that can be changed are sorted out from things that cannot be.\n\n\\*\\*I no longer live as fear-based. This reduced anger I was experiencing significantly. Once reduced, what anger I did experience was far easier to gain clarity about which led to handling it appropriately. When I see someone with a lot of anger, I see a fear-based operation running that person's life. I see someone making the same mistake I once did.\n\nI hope this answers your question.

I really like these:\n- Radical Acceptance (reading right now)\n- Zen Guitar (might be appealing if you play guitar or music)\n- Why good people do bad things\n- A new earth\n- When things fall apart\n- Who moved my cheese\n\ni am that sri nisargadatta\n\nThis is something I‚Äôm curious about.\n\nI have had friends recommend to me Dr. David Hawkins‚Äô idea of the Map of Consciousness. Basically that emotions progress upwards towards love and joy and peace and such as they are fully integrated, or felt or let go of.\n\nThey say even that the ‚Äúfrequencies‚Äù of different emotions have been measured and that they go up as positivity goes up.\n\nI‚Äôm with you on not weighting positive emotions over negative ones. I like Francis Weller‚Äôs quote saying something like ‚Äúmaturity is holding grief in one hand and gratitude in the other.‚Äù\n\nAnd I have also felt really at peace and lots of deep emotions doing an hour of meditation per day, especially body scanning, reading Eckhart Tolle, and practicing presence in my daily life. I felt emotions like I was in high school again.\n\nI have heard as you press deeper down a spiritual path, or meditative discipline, feelings of joy and peace arose and can become self sustaining.\n\nStill there is the question of avoiding spiritual escapism and even spiritual narcissism. Isn‚Äôt a narcissist a person who only focuses on things that make them feel good and eschews all bad?\n\nHow would one differentiate the two‚Äîintegrating the shadow versus denying it?\n\nIs it possible to be both really happy all the time and objective?\n\nThese are the things I wonder. Some meditation traditions say yes.\n\nDoes this translate positively into the world? Yet another question I have.\n\nEdit: chatGPT says no scientific evidence supporting Hawkins‚Äô ideas of emotions corresponding to frequencies in the way he describes it :/\n\nI enjoyed reading and pondering this.¬†\n\nMe too.\n\nGlad to hear it--thanks for saying so!\n\nI think there is a serious risk for seeing higher frequency (or positive emotions)  as \"good\" and lower frequency (or negative emotions) as \"bad\". They all work in the present and authentic self for what they are intended so if there has to be a \"goal\", I would consider it to be able to experience it all while weaving it all artfully into the tapestry of one's own life.\n\nI don't use the definition of narcissism you do. Mine is based on its etymology of being from the Greek myth of Narcissus with an ego run amuck.\n\nWhile I embrace objectivity as a direction (despite it not being a destination for humans at the present time), I especially don't seek to be \"happy all the time\". I don't seek period. I allow instead with a critical difference of what I allow -- a kind of fullness or broadest possible spectrum rather than a singular emotion. \n\nAs a result of that shift, I experience being genuinely and quite quietly content in what others conventionally label both \"good\" times and \"bad\" times. I enjoy (in various levels, of course) all of life, and attribute this largely to valuing the dark equally to the light, to being open to it all. Without being open to it all, one must edit and cannot avoid losing a corresponding chunk of reality which then impairs getting as close as possible to objectivity, in my thinking.\n\nAs for positivity in the world, the world, in my view, needs fully functioning humans who understand how reality works (so few do). See how value neutral that is? I think it is that way for reasons we still don't understand very well. Too \"busy\" grabbing for happy. If we had more fully functioning people, perhaps a lot more, the reality we all are co-creating would probably allow for a lot more ease of living.\n\nThanks so much for sharing your thoughts. They're very grounded and well thought out and interesting to hear. Also, I appreciate the directness.\n\nI think I have been struggling with this question actively lately. Hearing your thoughts is very grounding. I agree with objectivity as being important--more important with trying to force \"positive\" emotions.\n\nIt makes sense to me that you have an increased ability to be quietly happy and content in all times, both conventionally \"good\" and \"bad.\" This seems to me a natural consequence of accepting all of life--all of life becomes more enjoyable.\n\nI think two things are happening in our culture, at the same time, and they can be hard to tell apart: 1) a small few people are practicing quietly becoming okay with all of life. 2) a louder and probably greater amount of people are prioritizing \"positive emotions,\" trying to feel them all the time, and \"fixing\" negative emotions, or treating them like problems.\n\nBoth may appear joyful and grateful on the surface. One is on the path to wholeness, the other is on the path to... not being objective. But they can look similar and even have similar results. They can both even have very intricate self development routines.\n\nTo the point that sometimes the latter makes me question the former (which is what I tend towards).\n\nAs far as the former goes, number 1:\n\nI have been thoroughly enjoying a podcast recently on Kazimierz Dabrowski's theor of positive disintegration. The idea is that sometimes going *through* ordeals where a person's personality structure disintegrates can be a very positive process for the individual's growth, resulting in reintegrating to society with a much more authentic and fully thriving, selfless/altruistic, identity. Dabrowski studied suicide and people experiencing very difficult things for years of his life. And he developed this theory based on the minority of cases he saw where difficulty brought growth. It's similar to what we now call post-traumatic growth. \n\nDabrowski's theory is detailed and well-supported. And there's lots of ongoing scholarship going on around. I haven't found a podcast I relate to as much as the Positive Disintegration one. It's on becoming one's best self *while* integrating all the painful parts of life, not running from discomfort, but allowing it to be a jump off point for growth (something I see as part of objectivity). \n\nThat being said, there is value for sure in 'focusing on the positive' and being grateful. Whether you've been through a traumatic event or not. Telling someone actively suffering from trauma or PTSD to focus on the positive will probably not lead to their highest development. But, once that person is integrating the negative (\"\"), it will probably help them at some point to focus on the positive.\n\nI do like Albert Camus' quote on \"invincible summer.\" \"In the midst of winter, I found there was, within me, an invincible summer.\" \n\n&gt;And that makes me happy. For it says that no matter how hard the world pushes against me, within me, there‚Äôs something stronger ‚Äì something better, pushing right back.\n\nBasically, if I get to or have to choose between a loving reality and a nihilistic reality, I will choose to add love, even if all I can see around me is dark. It's not logical, or maybe it is--it's more visceral. What else am I going to do? It seems like something that is not forced, but rather, uncovered. Perhaps one has to go into the midst of winter to find it. \n\nThis is different from avoiding the possibility of nihilism or from running away from and denying \"negative\" emotions. It was exploring the idea of nihilism, actually, that lead me to this finding in myself actually.\n\nI think there are Buddhist teachings around combining mindfulness (awareness of what is, present reality) with compassion. Compassion for what is, basically I think. I think it's nuanced and intricate to teach or to learn.\n\nAs far as why things are the way they are in our culture--I like the idea Francis Weller's work on grief and have been hearing that the pace of the modern world doesn't allow us time to grieve nor do we have adequate measures for dealing with grief. I've heard in some indigenous societies people would not work for 6 months or a year after a family member or an intimate partner or close friend died, or something like that. I'm not sure exactly the traditions, but I know there was much more time and intention given to grief in many indigenous cultures.\n\nSimilarly, I think we don't give much time to lots of difficult and/or emotional life experiences. Child birth. Becoming a parent. Early life of a child. Spending time with kids as they grow up. Resting during the winter. Time for creativity, play and connection. So much of our world has become economic or geared towards maintaining or creating appearances rather than genuinely connecting.\n\nSimilarly, on narcissism: you said you use the etymological definition of ego run amok. I also believe I am using this definition when I refer to someone who runs away from emotions they deem \"negative.\" \n\nWikipedia's description of narcissism from the Narcissus article:\n\n&gt;The character of Narcissus is the origin of the term [narcissism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissism), a self-centered personality style. This quality in extreme contributes to the definition of [narcissistic personality disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissistic_personality_disorder), a [psychiatric condition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatric_condition) marked by [grandiosity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandiosity), excessive need for attention and admiration, and an inability to empathize.\n\nIf one is not able to feel their own \"negative\" feelings, how can they empathize with someone else's? Our sadness, our grief, connect us to the world and to others. Running from them, we become caught up in ourselves, we require grandiose fantasies to sustain us, we need the approval of others as a supplement to our inner void--which can never be filled. We are shut off from the world, trading it for endless desires and illusions. Narcissism has degrees of course, and we all have some. I would say \"ego,\" has a lot of similarities. Regardless, it seems to have run amok in American society.\n\nI like lately, as well, other books and authors I am hearing of and reading from on paths to \"wholeness\" or \"hidden wholeness,\" authenticity, letting go, grace, that sort of thing. I think you're right, the reasons for the being out of touch with reality are not fully known. \n\nI also really like Bill Plotkin's work. His explanation is that around 80% of American adults are at a (pathological) adolescent stage of development and have not become true adults in the psychological or spiritual sense. The adoloscent being more someone who lives for external things, while the true adult being more of someone capable of feeling all of life and living for things beyond themselves.\n\nHere's my 2 cents on chasing positive emotions.\n\nchasing or desiring, creates resistance. they are two ends of the same stick. if you desire something, you automatically resist that which is not that thing. thus a dualistic world is created. this is why desire ranks below 200 on the consciousness scale. not just with positive emotions but with anything in life. \n\n\nonly chasing positive emotions is the trap i fell into last year when i got started with this. i was trying to not 'feel' negative emotions and be happy/joyful all the time. what it did was suppressed negative emotions in my psyche. which will come later stronger. the better way that a few commentors below me mentioned is being 'okay' with whatever you're feeling. letting it run it's motion and go away by itself. don't desire it to be different. learn to practice 'acceptance' &amp; 'non-resistance' to what is.\n\nInteresting‚Ä¶ thanks so much for sharing! So cool how you and this commentor actually agree. Even though they disagree with the language that is used to communicate the stuff.\n\nSo glad you got thru that trap. Congrats ‚úäüèº‚úäüèº‚úäüèº\n\nDoes Dr. Hawkins‚Äô writing address this? Or any of the books you mentioned? I think when people hear of spiritual language, we can become skeptical, because such things have been used by cults in the past to take advantage of people‚Äîeven or especially of their wishful thinking.\n\nyeah most of his books do. start with power vs force. see how you like it and go from there.\n\nhis paid lectures on veritaspub is gold too.\n\nThank you, I‚Äôll have to do that. I really wanna get to the bottom of what I think on this stuff. Find anything useful and also understand how/if it can be used for spiritual bypassing.\n\nFor some of us it can be hard to believe our natural state is more loving joyful and blissful than we have come to believe. But I‚Äôm definitely more open to it lately.\n\nprofessional trauma healing does help a lot. ive been looking into it lately. 1 year into spirituality. use every advantage you can get. psychological and spiritual.\n\nGloria In Excelsis Deo.\n\nCool. Yea I‚Äôm fixing to jump into some trauma healing work it seems like. Been kinda skirting around it for a while. Thanks for sharing what you‚Äôve learned!\n\nYeah, that‚Äôs why Mr. Hawking enjoyed a good time at Epstein Island üòâ\n\nSounds like that was Stephen Hawking\n\nWell this advice didn't help a bit for anxiety and people considered meditation as a religious ritual before 2000. People usually consider science as a fact when in reality it's constantly changing and it's far from perfect specially in the field of human mind which we understand soo little yet people draws absurd conclusions.\n\nI've OCD and Anxiety and gone through dozen of doctors. No medication helped. Only meditation helped a bit which was considered pseudo science back in the days, is not invented / discovered by science, just validated lately by science. Science which people praise because that's how we'll conditioned for the start. All religious practices specially from south - east should not be considered bs by default just because someone can't wrap their head around it\n\nHi, do u have any books u recommend that aren‚Äôt spiritual? While I do read spiritual texts; currently buddhist texts; I usually translate it into a more scientific/secular view. Now, sometimes I don‚Äôt know if this ‚Äòtranslation‚Äô is all that accurate. Do u usually learn from psychology textbooks or are there pop-science books u‚Äôve learnt things from?\n\nThe near impossible task I face here answering your question is that I have read many non-spiritual books in my journey to being a present, authentic, reality based meditating person. No one book stands out and even if it did, it stood out to me at a specific time when it may not to you, let alone even  the current me. It is best to follow one's own rabbit holes on this, if you get what I mean.\n\nThat said, I will mentioned that one of the books with the greatest effect on me was People of the Lie by M. Scott Peck. It was offered by a highly talented therapist who helped me save my life over forty years ago.\n\nThe last two I read recently: I enjoyed Consciousness: confessions of a romantic reductionist by Christof Koch and I took a stab at The Courage To Be Disliked by Kishimi and Koga but ditched it several chapters in for how poorly he represented Alfred Adler's work. I'm about to reread the Spirituality of Imperfection, which is not quite as spiritual as it sounds, in my view.  Not sure what constitutes a \"pop-science book\" since \"pop\" probably isn't in my active lexicon.\n\n#\n\nThank u for the recommendations; with pop science, I generally imply books (usually) based on academic research that are worded in a way that the general population is able to read it instead of the very monotone and bland nature of academic papers.\n\nThank you for clarity on what you meant by pop science. I can read textbooks and/or academic papers if and when a deep dive warrants it. But even with being gifted in language skills, those can read as pretty dry for me. Brilliance in a topic is no guarantee of good writing skills and a poorly written piece tends to be a big turn off. Example: The Four Agreements, a book which I slogged through only because a friend wanted to read it together. Someone should fire that author's editor.\n\nprometheus rising. and some of the other stuff in the reading list.\n\nOh, I overlooked the book presently being read: The Wisdom of Insecurity by Alan Watts. Highly recommend it!\n\nAnd I realized I didn't fully answer your question, and yes, I have learned a great deal from psychology books, just not textbooks however.\n\nI like this . Now make it a post as long as op's , hehe¬†\n\nlol Time is perhaps better spent elsewhere.\n\nScience, modern psychology has grown out of eastern spiritual traditions. So science and spiritualism are just different names for the same thing when your talking psychology and indeed quantum physics. There will be a massive resistance to OP outline of basically 'how to spiritually awaken' because of a few thousand years of deep deep conditioning. Therefore I would add to the OP that the first step for many before they can embark on the steps above is to start by questioning everything, absolutely everything.\n\nlol questioning everything is extremely bad advice for anxiety. its appropriate for self discovery and all that, but especially where you come from, excuse my presumption, it literally tinges on psychosis. healing from Something and \"spiritual development\" mustnt always be the same.\n\nPeople with anxiety disorders typically do question everything already...\n\nThat's nonsense.\n\non point man.\n\nI have to say that anything called something like \"Quantum Psychology\" or \"Quantum Healing\" immediately gives me the ick and raises a number of red flags. I appreciate personal philosophical insights, but please do not try and force a 'physics sauce' over it. Talking about arguably the most difficult area of physics, you're bound to be horribly wrong if you're not a phycisist and still try to relate such concepts to your philosophy. Even worse if it's in the title.\n\nI get the initial turn off to a book called Quantum Psychology. This book is by Robert Anton Wilson and he's not the same as your Depak Chopra pseudo-intellectual types. It goes into how semantics and language effect our psychology and how developments into quantum physics challenge our notions of logic and self perception. It is centered around the idea of E-Prime, using language without the verb \"to be\". It is meant to deconstruct the particle/wave paradox of light. Using this language you then apply it to your own self identity. \n\n\n\nTake it for what it's worth, but I found the book to be very illuminating.\n\nRobert anton wilson is probably one of the BEST thinkers in the last few decades. Shame not many people know about him.\n\nI'd highly recommend prometheus rising to anybody reading this.\n\nI feel like this post triggered something inside you. All was meant with good intentions brother. This is a public forum, where no one is 'forcing' you to do anything. I like you - don't agree with everything out there, doesn't mean I automatically invalidate it. Regarding Quantum Healing, I haven't tried the last few books out myself or any of that regards, but those have worked for people I have known in the past, hence I linked it. Everyone has a different path in life. Please try to refrain from such judgemental comments. It'll be better - both - for your external and internal world both. Peace.\n\nThis was quite a condescending reply to a pretty respectful comment. I think it triggered something in you. Just think about it, brother. Peace :)\n\nYeah for real, the post makes it seem OP was completely rid of judgement, stopped resisting emotions / feelings, accepted more and was compassionate, etc. Then one comment undid all of that lol\n\nNah lol I'm still a human with an ego. Been working on it like everyone else. No where in post did i mentioned I was completely rid of judgement. That's just what you picked up lol.\n\nWorking hard on it, or hardly working on it?\n\nidk man.\n\nNot gonna read his post bc of this\n\n\"oh I don't like the person, I'm not gonna read the super helpful post that could change my life - because he was the one who wrote it\"\n\nwomp womp nigga hahahah. i find this kind of thinking so funny.\n\nI found the post valuable but you're doing it again friend.\n\nthanks. its hard to convey tone over text but i appreciate it.\n\nDeflection is always a sign of a weak or irrational argument, not to mention a classic rhetorical fallacy.\n\nEveryone judges, including you. Some of us allowed it to evolve into discernment, while others still don't know the difference.\n\nman, aren‚Äôt you a mess. \n\nconstantly slapping on a ‚Äúpeace and love‚Äù face doesn‚Äôt mask the fact that you‚Äôre a judgmental, shallow and condescending person in all your replies on this post. \n\njust like how theres tons of vehemently anti-lgbt conservatives who turn out to be gay, theres so many ‚Äúpeace and love‚Äù folk who turn out to be the most judgmental and conflicted of us all\n\nI think it‚Äôs because all of the ‚Äúpeace and love‚Äù folk tend to repress a lot of their negative emotional feelings, instead of letting them out especially in the most appropriate situations. I should know, I was one. But now I‚Äôm learning that we have emotions such as anger, fear, judgement, grief, etc for a reason. \n\nIt‚Äôs just like someone else said, it‚Äôs about being able to discern when to put these emotions into practice especially when the situation calls for it. But also not allowing them to control you especially when it‚Äôs not appropriate or is just more unproductive than productive to use them.\n\nDo not worry about the comments here too much. I appreciated this post and I‚Äôm sure it will help others as well.\n\nAs someone with PTSD, I find that letting go, surrendering and trying to focus on my inner body are destabilising and feel like letting go into a helpless frozen and stuck trauma state. I wonder if anyone else experiences this and how to deal with it? Loving kindness and ujjayi work for me.¬†\n\nHave you checked out IFS? I also have C ptsd so close enough, and spending time inside myself use to be chaos because a part of me(the traumatised part) was in contant state of fear and hypervigilence, so surrendering= choosing to put myself in that state.\n\nAnd yup same showing myself compassion and love and sitting with those difficult emotions made that part more at ease, not totally but it makes it easier to cohabit with it.\n\nI have and am meeting a new therapist this week who does EMDR, IFS and somatic experiencing work. I did some EMDR in the past which was very helpful but then my therapist left the city I live in so it was abruptly cut short without running the full course. I too have cPTSD, I guess I just use the c interchangeably.  But yes you're definitely right, that is what is happening, which is why I don't like when people talk about just being inside and accepting and surrendering - just doing that without safety, compassion and grounding is not helpful at all, only retraumatising and makes things worse.\n\nWhen I can inhabit my wise compassionate adult self and go to those parts it really helps and works, but it is incredibly slow and painful work.\n\n[deleted]\n\nSaw your other comment. I hope you can get the treatment you need. I‚Äôm lucky in that I can pay for it.¬†\n\nwhat is IFS?\n\nInternal Family Systems\n\nThe problem with all of this, is that it could only help you on the \"present\" moment. It works as a painkiller without acknowledging the real issues that will arise to the surface again and again until you don't see them.\n\nAltho I'm a big follower of Tolle's teachings, even if I understand that the past and the future are illusory forms of the ego which have no relation with the real \"self\", you need to acknowledge your own past in order to understand why you do the things you do, why you feel the way you feel and why you think the way you think.\n\nWhen you start the process of \"shadow integration\" (Jungian term) you eventually won't need to meditate so often or having anxiety episodes, because in some way you will be dealing with the root cause of the issues instead of constantly dealing with the symptoms. Like a bad weed that grows again and again.\n\nYou need to give your past a little bit of entity instead of completely disregarding it. You have a past and that's ok. Once you come to terms with your past it won't have so much power to hunt you in the present and it will leave you alone to live your life with more intentionality.\n\nExceptionally well stated. To be present and at origin/source is a powerful combination where healing becomes spontaneous. This is why the second item on my short list is to be authentic. When one reaches effective shadow integration, the authentic self shrugs off the adaptive self like how a butterfly emerges from the chrysalis. As a result, to know self is to know all humans.\n\nI agree. I‚Äôve been doing therapy for years but now returning to specialised trauma therapy to get to the root.¬†\n\n[deleted]\n\nSpecialised trauma therapy if you have (c)PTSD\n\nThank you\n\nI'd recommend checking out r/idealparentfigures. It's a fairly new, visualisation-based therapy. While designed to address attachment disturbances, it's application is broad and indirect trauma processing is part of the framework. Essentially, you develop an imagined set of ideal parents who are able to provide you a deep sense of safety and security, amongst other things, who can help you to build the capacity you need to move out of that frozen trauma state you describe. It can be used in conjunction with other modalities effectively (e.g. IFS, somatic experiencing) if needs be, though is very impactful all by itself.\n\nHere's a sneak peek of /r/idealparentfigures using the [top posts](https://np.reddit.com/r/idealparentfigures/top/?sort=top&amp;t=all) of all time!\n\n\\#1: [Introduction to the Ideal Parent Figure Method](https://np.reddit.com/r/idealparentfigures/comments/vl27y9/introduction_to_the_ideal_parent_figure_method/)  \n\\#2: [I healed from ADHD through what's essentially this method... by being my own IPF.](https://np.reddit.com/r/idealparentfigures/comments/1bxsshq/i_healed_from_adhd_through_whats_essentially_this/)  \n\\#3: [The Happiest I've Ever Been](https://np.reddit.com/r/idealparentfigures/comments/17kmzes/the_happiest_ive_ever_been/)\n\n----\n^^I'm ^^a ^^bot, ^^beep ^^boop ^^| ^^Downvote ^^to ^^remove ^^| ^^[Contact](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=sneakpeekbot) ^^| ^^[Info](https://np.reddit.com/r/sneakpeekbot/) ^^| ^^[Opt-out](https://np.reddit.com/r/sneakpeekbot/comments/o8wk1r/blacklist_ix/) ^^| ^^[GitHub](https://github.com/ghnr/sneakpeekbot)\n\nThanks! I‚Äôm actually doing this in a way through my compassionate self. My ideal wise adult compassionate self is the ideal father version of me with my kid(s). Then I just get that self to look at the present me or the vulnerable parts! It‚Äôs very effective.¬†\n\nI can't say for sure, but it might help to look into professional trauma councelling. Somatic work or something along the lines like Killmekillme said below. Internal Family Systems is also quite popular.\n\nHey man, on second note, look for Jordon Thorton on Youtube. Dude has some of the greatest psychological healing stuff for PTSD, CPTSD stuff and others.\n\nSounds like pain you need to deal with so that it can be released.\n\nah. a copywriter. get banned mate.\n\nWhat does that mean\n\nI love your post and find it very inspiring,, not sure why you got so much negativity for it. Just wanted to say thank you for taking the time to write all of this down in so much detail. I can tell your intentions are genuine and noble.üôè‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nAgreed.\n\nTldr?\n\ndon't bother it's garbage! a whole lot of nothing. feels like an ai wrote this shit and someone rephrased it. It's superficial at best, incoherent mumbling at worst\n\nI don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a gracious take. People are too quick to judge. How you treat others is how you treat yourself. Self-judgement is the root of most of anxiety. OP‚Äôs post will work if followed. It‚Äôs just cause and effect.\n\nCertainly far more steps than a person can keep in mind all the time.\n\nOnly to those who are incapable of getting anything useful from it. Which to be honest is most of Reddit\n\nIs it me or is TLDR becoming a relic of the past? üíÄ\n\nusername checks out\n\nthe truth finds itself in many ways\n\nWhy‚Äôs everyone ripping you, I thought it was a good post\n\nDude same‚Ä¶ mans out here just sharing info, and everyone came for him.. I think it was a helpful post.\n\nEgos!\n\nGotta agree with all you guys here, its shocking actually. I wonder if these people are paid so they prevent us from finding great advice. The population needs to remain weak after all.\n\ntrue man, the negative field has quite a pull on some people.\n\nI found your post very valuable, will study it the next 3 months. \n\nThank you again for your help.\n\nI had the same thought.. very well said\n\nIt's what Eckhart Tolle calls Pain Body reaction. It's not that they want to really, they just can't help it. Afterall, they're only doing what seems right.\n\nEveryone else saw through his bullshit. I can sit here and go through it and call out all the BS, but I urge you to take a closer look at all the BS advice given. Trying to mix science and religion, that 4 paragraph introduction, etc etc.... What a load.\n\nIt‚Äôs a so-so post. More fluff than substance.\n\nThe only part I found useful was the actual practice of imagining the fear and letting it go before doing the real thing. \n\nI don‚Äôt dislike the post but I can understand why others might.\n\nFor real.\n\nI don't think what he has posted will work.\nI practice meditation and mindfulness.\n\nIt is true that I am not constant, but I think that the root of the social phobia is not there.\n\nBe present with yourself. Cry it out, feel it, process it, write it, voice it out, move your body even if you don't feel like it. Anxiety is a lie.\n\nyou're focusing on expression of emotions. which works but is an inefficient way to process emotions. since it only releases some of it but stuffs most of it down. the best way to release emotions is not to cry it out or do anything externally but to sit with it and let it be. let it run its course.\n\nsource: letting go (David hawkins)\n\nit helps to cry but not too much. you have to listen to your body too\n\ntrue. sometime it can too overwhelming.\n\nI'd also recommend the book *love yourself like your life depends on it*. It would compliment this well\n\nthanks. looking into it.\n\nDoesn't work for everyone. These \"how tos\" that only worked for one person need to go away.\n\n\"Real intelligence is like a river; the deeper it is, the less noise it makes.\"\n\nThere's a lot of noise and not a whole lot of substance in these posts.\n\nread the post again. already mentioned this won't work for everyone.\n\nThis is the technique I used to lose weight. I'd feel a self-judged 8-10/10 hunger (10 is nauseous) and binge eat in response. Basically I did the same thing you described, I would observe the nature of my hunger the moment it happened, letting go came naturally at that point. It showed me the true severity of my hunger, which was far lower than what it was when I'd experience hunger passively without intentional observance. I've lost over 50 lbs without any special dieting, and the effort required is far lower than any diet I've ever tried, because observing is really all I'm doing which is extremely low effort\n\n50lbs is crazy work. congrats yo.\n\nThank you for taking the time to post this. I see people wanting the quick notes. For something like meditation you‚Äôd want to take the time to learn the nuances so you can maximize the benefits of the time you spend meditating and not want the quick way always.\n\nHow generous of you to share all of this!\n\nHere‚Äôs a simplified summary:\n\n**How to Reduce 98% of Social Anxiety**\n\nThis guide shares steps to significantly reduce social anxiety, allowing you to comfortably talk to anyone. It requires adopting a new mindset and consistent practice over several months. Key steps include:\n\n1. **Active Meditation**: Practice both focused meditation and staying present in the moment.\n2. **Spiritual Reading**: Study texts like ‚ÄúA Course in Miracles‚Äù and works by Dr. David Hawkins and Eckhart Tolle.\n3. **Loving-Kindness Meditation**: Cultivate self-love to counter negative self-talk.\n4. **Letting Go**: Use methods like the Sedona Method to release emotional tensions and fears.\n\n**Additional Tips**:\n- Remove judgment and practice self-compassion.\n- Expect resistance, unconscious habits, and judgment as obstacles.\n- Reading recommended spiritual texts is essential for deeper understanding.\n\nBy following these practices, you can greatly reduce social anxiety and improve your overall well-being.\n\n\nSorry I have ADHD and that was way too much text to read so I just CHAT GPT Summarized this lol\n\nThank you so much for taking the time to share your experience and learnings with us. They are a gift to this world. I will screen shot your post to keep as reference. üôèüôèüôè thank you\n\nHow does one overcome the feeling of just not knowing what to say or feeling like they have nothing to contribute? No matter how present and relaxed I am, I still struggle with this.\n\nIt comes from a sense of worth. Do you think you're worthy? Do you think the words you're speaking have value? Regardless of what it is? Do you think people like to be around you? Not everyone, but people you vibe with. Answer these deep down questions. It always has to do with beliefs. Considering you're over 20. You have 20 years of material to talk about. So the only person filtering out what to say and what not to say is YOU - based on some limiting belief.\n\nThat‚Äôs wonderful advice. I‚Äôm glad it came from ‚Äúdigital-cunt.‚Äù Haha.\n\nI‚Äôve done most of this Hawkins especially is a favourite teacher. Done acim twice, Sedona method read eckhart and meditation and this definitely helps. Used to be nervous walking up to a party terrified of how it would go now it‚Äôs exciting and I feel I can talk to anyone. The only area I still feel heavy anxiety is intimate relationships and girls especially, approaching a girl on the street to ask for her number is still terrifying. I‚Äôm currently doing the 12 steps for love avoidance and anorexia which hopefully will resolve this area. But what you‚Äôve posted definitely helps.\n\nLove it man. I started on this journey for girls mostly. Being social with everyone being a side effect. If you can, try to get your hands on Blueprint Decoded by RSD Tyler. It'll help you massively in rewiring your limiting beliefs around women. It changed my life personally. Otherwise, look if you're pedestalizing women for her superficial qualities. If you're treating them differently in your mind. Positionalities created by our ego's causes unnecessary stress and anxiety. Shadow work helps in finding out what you really believe about your relationship to girls in general.\n\nHow did it help? Do you find you can talk to girls easily now, do you have a girlfriend? Also dunno why you‚Äôre being downvoted lol. Also what resources would you reccomend to do shadow work around how you relate to girls like you said?\n\nyeah, talking to girls happens easily rn, without thinking about it, because i now see them the same as me. i have a few open flings going on, but don't have any plans to settle for anything soon - private reasons.\n\ndownvote doesn't matter lol. this was the hardest realization for me as a people pleaser over the last year. that i dont have to get everyone to like me. its fine.\n\nthere's no such shadow work guide specificially for girls but search for Transformation Mastery by Julien Blanc on YT and Owen Cook's stuff. Those are really good pointers.\n\nHey man, for what it's worth, I liked your post. I've been going down a similar path it seems. I've been on it more for a decade than months and have a ways to go though. I think you did a nice job of breaking down different avenues to explore to become more at peace and reduce judgment. I think others can get something out of this.\n\nI'd suggest you add Ken Wilber and Pierre Teilhard De Chardin to the readings as well.\n\ni like ken wilber's stuff on yt. but man is he a terrible writer. checking out pierre now.\n\nThis is amazing!!! Doing 12 steps with a sponsor in any group also helps a lot!\n\nThis is super helpful!\n\nBeing 100% free of anxiety doesn't seem possible nor healthy in modern civilization. Any mental health professional will attest that some degree of it is normal and actually useful. The only way it might be obtainable is by living solely in nature or in a monastery/temple where literally everyone is on the same program. This message isn't intended to dissuade anyone from reducing anxiety levels but to keep a realistic viewpoint on the subject.\n\nAnxiety is simply a useful tool the brain has to motivate action. Too much is bad, none is bad. It being triggered by unimportant, noncritical, non-life threatening things such as just being around people is bad. Not having anxiety when you hear growling from the bushes nearby in the dead of night is really bad. Middle road.\n\nSocial Anxiety. Normal anxiety is good. Social anxiety that comes from socially conditioned beliefs is bad. That is what I point at to overcome.\n\nSolid post man thank you for sharing!\n\nWhatever dude.\n\nthis made me laugh so hard lmao.\n\nAmazing\n\nI‚Äôm there.\n\n.....\n\n[removed]\n\njoined.\n\n[removed]\n\nWe do not allow self posts with links from new members.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I watch this often too to help with retraining [https://www.youtube.com/@JoeyKleinIMS](https://www.youtube.com/@JoeyKleinIMS)\n\nwow thanks for the gem. never heard of joey before. adding this to my watch list now.\n\nAw cool, glad you liked it! :)\n\nI‚Äôve been dealing with social anxiety, and Eddins Counseling Group has been a game changer for me. The support I've received there has been amazing. Highly recommend them if you‚Äôre looking for help!\n\n[https://eddinscounseling.com/specialty/social-anxiety-treatment/](https://eddinscounseling.com/specialty/social-anxiety-treatment/)\n\nIn simple terms, learn to love yourself and look at everyone else as they are you.\n\nyes. but easier said than done.\n\nVery good compilation \nI‚Äôve read and practiced most of what you wrote \nI agree this approach would work very well for most problems in life\n\nhaven't read anything this long in a while, well worth it\n\nPost saved\n\nWhats an inner body?\n\nRead power of now ch. 6\n\nI litteraly searched for your post when I had it on my notifications. Glad I found you again\n\nYessir. Hope this one doesn't get removed because of the hate lol.\n\nThanks, appreciate the excitement, seems like its really working for you. Community here is summarizing everything into bite sized chunks. Thats nice of them\n\n\nAs long as its working for you, keep going, you are in the middle of healing so helping others right now isn‚Äôt your purpose, healing is. These kinds of posts can curtail your journey because people who don‚Äôt understand will judge and criticize something that you are not 100% through. You‚Äôll gain a lot of clarity after all is set and done. \n\nACIM is an AWESOME book, incredible power and truth in it. I‚Äôve been listening to it and I can feel a shift from pain to healed almost instantly. Just that my body then reorients itself back to pain. Its an ongoing process of undoing the damage but thats the the work. So good luck friend, can‚Äôt wait to see you 100% without anxiety :)\n\nThankyou bro. You're right I have heard of that before. I have worked on it in the past so that it doesn't affect me.\n\nAlso a note on ACIM from what I have read from Dr. David Hawkins - ACIM Textbook demonizes the EGO. Which makes it hard to transcend in the later stages. Workbook doesn't. He recommends treating the Ego has a pet not as something you have to get rid of. Creates unnecessary resistance in some.\n\nThank you OP!!\n\nComprehensive af! Well done üôå\n\nYou're talking about inducing a spiritual awakening, which is great even if you only succeed with one person üåº\n\nthats the goal, hopefully this becomes a pointer for many.\n\nDo you think beta blockers can help during this process??\n\n&gt; beta blockers\n\nI haven't tried this out personally. Here's my 2 cents - take it with a grain of salt - any external influence that limits certain emotions, only  imo, represses it. Since the only way to safely let go of an emotion is to release it. Which is something the body naturally does once you let it. I haven't ever heard of any supplement helping with release. ever. So yeah, if you want permanent change, beta blockers or any other medication might not be the best thing. \n\nI used to use ashwagandha to mitigate stress but that only stuffed it down for it to later pop up. I don't use it anymore.\n\nWhat qualifies as an \"external meditation link.\"?\n\nI think I have sometimes linked to various pages of people teaching or selling some meditation related stuff.\n\nIts weird man. some post link stuff and don't get removed. some do. idk, up to the mods i guess.\n\nUsername checks out.\n\nwaou thank you very much, it seems so easy to apply all of these advices !!\n\nWhen I think of anxiety, I think my 3 year old is too close to the guard rail on the 20th floor anxieties. Talking to people is hard for some???\n\nyeah. social conditioning fills your mind up with garbage.\n\n[removed]\n\nthanks man. posting this.\n\nCocaine works wonders for me\n\nso i have heard from most people. only if it was possible to keep the affects permanent. too expensive habit :(*"

But you can‚Äôt see the ocean without seeing the waves; can‚Äôt see the waves without seeing the ocean. Difference is- there can be no wave without the ocean but there can be an ocean without waves.\n\nThere can be no wave without motion. The ocean of movement is all.\n\nAnd I immediately realized there is exactly one ocean that has no motion at all: the ocean of silence, stillness, emptiness. The ocean where motion dies until it is picked up again.\n\nThe ocean that is both moving and still; or you could say neither moving nor still. Our concepts get in the way of experiencing true reality.\n\nGood stuff. This has been said many ways: Form is emptiness, emptiness is form. But Form is form, and emptiness is emptiness ‚Ä¶ Within Yin is a little Yang, within Yang is a little Yin. üôè\n\nüíµThanks. It‚Äôs a difficult concept that can only be hinted at with metaphor. We seek the true reality of Emptiness, but the Buddha said the true reality of emptiness is no different than the true reality of the 5 aggregates. If we touch the true reality of the 5 aggregates, we touch the true reality of Emptiness. All the answers are within us; we are literally composed of the answers. It‚Äôs hard to see, but it makes sense when you stop thinking about it.\n\nThank YOU üôè Many moons ago I attended a retreat with Kwong roshi and Seung Sang (sp?) a visiting Korean zen master. It was an interesting mix of styles. The quiet, formal, introverted style of Kwong Roshi, and the loud festivity (like a noisy party that you didn‚Äôt want to be at) of Sueng‚Äòs group. There were chains of people chanting, playing instruments and drums, weaving thru the room. One minute Sueng would cut in front of a line and disrupt everything, the next minute he was walking stride by stride beside you, only for that to dissolve to different directions. The chant was in Korean, and seemed to continually change from - one thin quarter, to coca cola, etc. \n\nI was later honored to have a private interview with Seung and given specific instructions about how to enter the room, go around a corner, and where to do 3 prostrations. I listened carefully as it was  seemingly very important to get the form right. When I opened the door, the room was nothing like they me it would be! He was leaning on a big stick with a Cheshire Cat grin and motioned for me to come sit on a pillow that was uncomfortably close to him: eye to eye.\n\nHe asked me, ‚ÄúWhere do you come from?‚Äù Being brand new to Zen practice, and only dimly aware that he was asking me a koan, I said, ‚ÄúSanta Rosa‚Äù. He said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to ask you a question. If you answer me, I‚Äôll hit you. If you don‚Äôt answer me, I‚Äôll hit you.‚Äù I was terrified. I had an impulse to bolt. He made a subtle gesture that he could hit me before I got away. I was trapped. I meekly said, ‚Äúhere?‚Äù He said, ‚Äúoh, not there?‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù He said, ‚ÄúGood. If you knew what you meant by I don‚Äôt know that would be even better!‚Äù He then said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not really going to hit you‚Äù, and I relaxed some. Hey struck the floor with his stick and said, ‚ÄúThis is where you come from, the action, not the explanation.‚Äù Then the interview was apparently over, and we bowed to each other and I left.\n\nThat‚Äôs a great story. I‚Äôd love to go a retreat, but with family life and work I don‚Äôt think that will happen any time soon. I‚Äôm lucky to have a very fine sangha at the Buddhist temple in my city. They are so welcoming and accepting of everyone. I‚Äôm not as religious as they would like me to be, but I‚Äôm dedicated to mindfulness and living a good life so they accept me and teach me what they can. I‚Äôm very grateful.

Instead, it constantly transforms due to the causes and conditions which are like ripples, waves and tides flowing and interacting within itself. They arise, interact and pass, but they are all ultimately the ocean, which survives their arising and passing.\n\nYou are neither drop nor ocean. \n\n You are water\n\nI remember reading somewhere that Rumi drank mayonnaise on a daily basis, does anyone recall this?\n\nOne of my favourite. ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nWhenever i see quotes like this i like the way it sounds and i want to \"get it\" but i feel like i dont get it at all Sadly\n\nVery limited thinking, but has some meaning to it.  Some things are chaotic smashed dark matter great pain. Cornered with little chance of even choosing.  Barely conscious.\n\nAll of existence is harmony from the perspective of God\n\nIf you enjoy Rumi's work, I encourage you to check out Hafiz.\n\n*Manic Screaming*\n\nWe should make all spiritual talk  \nSimple today:  \nGod is trying to sell you something,   \nBut you don't want to buy.   \nThat is what your suffering is:  \nYour fantastic haggling,  \nYour manic screaming over the price!\n\nI like this a lot\n\nI can confirm that, after several years of personal development work, I have come to feel that we contain the universe and not the other way around.\n\nI think it's both personally, depending what level of \"I\" we're talking about\n\nYes. Something like that. U r a drop in the ocean, and you are the entire ocean in a drop. That is eu\n\nThere is a fish bowl.\nNow take the fish out of the bowl.\nNow it's no longer a fish bowl, it's just a bowl.\nThe fish bowl went away with the fish.\nThat means the fish bowl exists within the fish.\n\n\"The fish lives in the fish bowl as much as the fish bowl lives within the fish\"\n\nNot trying to be obstinate, but how do you explain hatred and abuse in this analogy.  I haven't seen an adequate explanation for this is we are all part of a whole.  I am not religious, so please no religious answers.\n\nHow is there any contradiction? I'm not religious either.\n\nAs Alan Watts says, chaos at one level is harmony at a higher level. In order for you to be healthy, there's a war going on in your blood. We live in the drama of duality, of polarity, at least from our perspective. From a higher perspective, it's all harmony.\n\nWhat is a Rumi?\n\nSomeone who shares an apartment with you.\n\nHuman AI\n\nYou are made up of the same things/thing as everything else. That does not mean everything is within you or anything like that though.\n\n\"If you‚Äôre ready to wake up, you‚Äôre going to wake up and if you‚Äôre not ready, you‚Äôre going to stay pretending that you're just ‚Äúpoor little me‚Äù.  \n\n\nAnd since you're all here and engaged in this sort of inquiry and listening to this sort of lecture, I  \nassume that you‚Äôre all on the process of waking up or else you‚Äôre teasing yourself with some kind of flirtation with waking up which you‚Äôre not serious about.  \n\n\nBut I assume maybe you are not serious, but sincere that you are ready to wake up. So then, when you‚Äôre in the way of waking up and finding out who you really are, what you do is what the whole universe is doing at the place you call here and now.  \n\n\nYou are something the whole universe is doing in the same way that a wave is something that the whole ocean is doing.  \n\n\nThe real you is not a puppet which life pushes around.  \nThe real, deep down you is the whole universe.\"\n\n-Alan Watts\n\nInterestingly though, Alan Watts specifically states that the you as in the human being are not the whole universe, but rather that isn't the real you. That the universe is you. Listening to his lectures he definitely doesn't prescribe to the idea that the universe is contained within you, but rather you're contained within the universe and actually you don't exist, so there is just the Universe. I see it the same way.\n\nWant to link where he says this? I've listened to probably hundreds of his lectures and not sure I've heard that one, I'm interested!\n\nhttps://youtu.be/C0T9icPl3rw?si=9MRr7VSk-aAKmDCP\n\nThis video technically illuminates the idea. When you say 'the universe is contained within you' or that you are the universe contained within a drop, it alludes to this notion that your self as you know it as the human being has within it the entire universe, but that's not true. Yes, you are the universe, but only because everything is, and there is no separate you that is apart from it. It's not that the universe is contained within you, but that 'you' are contained within it, and to decide that everything outside your skin is not you is merely an illusion of consciousness. \n\nTo write the story the other way is to take your personal identity and impose it upon the world around you, vs to dissolve that personal identity and see there really are no separate selves. It's a subtle difference, and both obviously lead to similar feelings of oneness, but it's still a difference. It's hard to speak about clearly because when I say you, the intuitive impression of that word is that I'm talking about a person other than me, you. But the real 'you' is not about that person at all.\n\nBy saying \"to decide that everything outside your skin is not you is merely an illusion of consciousness\", aren't you also saying that the entire Universe is inside you?\n\nHow would it be saying that?\n\nEverything outside you being you implies that you are everything. If everything outside you is you, then nothing isn't you, see what I'm saying?\n\nYeah, and I feel like we've had this conversation. Everything outside you is you, but not you as in the human being, but you as in the real you which is the universe. The implication of 'the universe is within you' implies that the human being is infinite and everything.\n\nAhh I see the confusion. This is why earlier I said \"it depends what level of \"I\" we're talking about\". Fundamentally we're all God/Source/the Universe or whatever, and it's all the same. From that perspective of \"I\" (the REAL you), it's all within. This is the point I was trying to make earlier, speaking from a more fundamental God perspective, but I think the confusion was people thought I meant it's all within the 3d perspective.\n\nI think it's both personally, depending on what level of \"I\" we're talking about.\n\n\"While All is in THE ALL, it is equally true that THE ALL is in ALL. To him who truly understands this truth hath come great knowledge.\" -The Kybalion.\n\nA piece of infinity is still infinity ‚ôæÔ∏è\n\nHmm. Do you believe the self exists? \n\nA piece of infinity may still be infinity, but it doesn't contain the rest of that infinity. Maths does show us infinities can be different sizes. When I meet you, it is not that I the person is the same as you, but that I the fundamental forces of the universe am both of us. This view aligns me to with science and observations. However, a lot of this comes down to the non-existence of a personal self. Without that, there's not really anyone else but the all.\n\nI think the Universe is all God Godding, I understand the self doesn't \"exist\", I think it's all real as we believe it to be, most people are lost in the illusion, which is part of the game. I think fundamentally we are all God or Source. As Alan Watts says, \"the right hand of God pretending it doesn't know what the left is doing\".\n\nYeah I appreciate that view, but as Alan Watts also says 'I'm not trying to convince you of these ideas, I just want you to play with them and think about the possibilities'. I don't subscribe to the idea of God or source, but I do appreciate that this life would be exactly that way if it were true. I just think there is the Universe, and while some may call that God, I think that the word God is really to be reserved for something above just the natural world.\n\nWords are just symbols, I generally don't like to use the word God and like Source or the Universe more, but I'm pointing to the same thing. When the Buddha was asked about God, he went silent, which is the only true answer. To try to describe God is already cutting up the pie, and words will always fall short because God is not words.\n\nHere's another quote.\n\n&gt;And they‚Äôre all you, only you can only experience it one at a time. Everybody is I, you all know you‚Äôre you, and wheresoever beings exist throughout all galaxies, it doesn‚Äôt make any difference. You are all of them. And when they come into being, that‚Äôs you coming into being.\n\nCan you see how this cannot be talking about you as in the person you are today? But a more enduring you, the one that is *also* the person you are today?\n\nIt's all \"I\". We are all the same consciousness (God, Source) being expressed through different bodies and nervous systems. You are another me and I am another you.\n\nAgain, I'd say we're both the universe and not another I or yous. That implies there's separation somewhere. It's not that I am another you, it's that we're both simultaneously I. It may seem subtle, as I said, but I do think it's a distinction. The language you use makes me think you believe there is a supreme self.\n\nI think you're getting too caught up in the language I'm using. When I'm saying \"you,\" I'm referring to you from this plane of existence, how we use the word in our normal day to day. Fundamentally, it's all \"I\" though. This stuff can be hard to talk about, especially through text, because there's different layers/levels to it. Not sure what you mean by \"supreme self\".\n\nThe supreme self bit is not relevant to be fair so ignore that.\n\nAnd perhaps I am, I don't think we're saying something too different. I've basically said it's all I, but what I'm getting at is that it's not that it's all the ego. Many people can take this feeling and come to think that their ego is all I, and I think ideas such as within us is the entire universe imply that is what's happening, whereas instead the ego is but an illusion of the senses and really deep down our real self is all.\n\nAgreed. The ego isn't bad but it's an illusion, and it's impossible to find true freedom if a person is identified with their ego (as most people are). What we are is the formless awareness behind the ego, and when we take a step back, we can watch our ego without identifying with it. Some of my more conscious friends, I'll even communicate with them by saying things like \"my ego is angry right now\" or my \"my ego is sad right now\" etc., because I'm able to watch and see what my ego is thinking and feeling it, but also not identifying with it.\n\nI used to walk through the forest listening to 7 hour talks, and it came up there I think. I'll try find you the quote though, but might take a while.\n\nThe universe is like a bucket of legos. We are each made of legos from the bucket, as we live some legos are swapped out and this process continues until we are fully disassembled and put back into the bucket. \n\nEverything in the universe is like this, but the entire bucket of legos is split between everything, everything cannot be made of everything else, as everything else is already in use.\n\n[deleted]\n\nThe mind is 100% made up of the same things and properties of the rest of the universe, just in a different orientation.\n\nPhysical is a term that conforms to our views of reality, nobody knows what anything is made of, not scientists or Buddhists. It could be infinite smaller particles and waves or there could be a single particle that everything is made up of or something else entirely.\n\nThe important thing is that the scientists often branded as egotistical westerners on subs like this will admit that to you.\n\nAnd I don‚Äôt see the problem in the mind body problem after reading the Wikipedia page about it. I don‚Äôt know much about it so maybe you could explain?\n\nI was going to say the same thing. I believe the self we think we are is an arbitrary division that doesn't exist outside our minds, so 'we' are the universe, but I don't believe that the person I am is the universe, but instead the universe is this person, as well as everyone else.\n\nWe are made of what Buddhists call the Five Aggregates. Everything else is also made of those same aggregates. U.S. being different than everything else is only due to our faulty perception.\n\nI am not Buddhist and while I respect their psychology everything they have said is made up by humans. It‚Äôs not based on any sort of scientific method or truth finding process. It‚Äôs a religion and that‚Äôs okay, but please don‚Äôt assume your perception is accurate and mine isn‚Äôt.\n\nIf you look at my first comment we‚Äôre not really in disagreement, accept maybe their is no such thing as the ‚Äú5 aggregates‚Äù imo\n\nThere is no 5 aggregates. Not in the way we conceive of them, no\n\nThey meditate deeply, which leads to realizations about the nature of the self, which in turn leads to realizations about the universe. It's a naturalistic religion.\n\nIt leads to assumptions, their meditations very rarely lead to experimentation. They do make for a healthy and balanced way of life.\n\nWhat you're doing right now is making assumptions.\n\nWhat they were doing is analysing the self, and sharing their insight. Maybe you should do some more reading into the source of the Buddhist and Hindu traditions. These practices allow communion with the divine within ourself, and from that, realizations about the nature of reality.\n\n\"Know yourselves and you shall know the universe and the Gods\".\n\nHey we both are, but the philosophy I‚Äôm pushing is one that doesn‚Äôt place importance on things without evidence and that cannot be gathered through meditation. I respect your beliefs but I have not seen any evidence for ‚Äúdivine‚Äù things at all. Rather i enjoy the mental aspect of these religions and think of the supernatural parts as more of anthropomorphic representations of parts or reality.\n\nI don‚Äôt think either of us are going to convince the other, so I hope you have good luck with your journey through the universe."

    "title": "How 3 Months of Meditation Transformed My View of Life",
    "body": "I've held nihilistic views towards the world for as long as I can remember. When people see a glass half full, I refuse to recognize the premise that there is even a glass. Living this way, frankly, is tiring. Waking up every single day attached to an attitude that refuses to attach any sort of meaning to life is the pinnacle of self-sabotage.\n\nMy entire self-loathing viewpoint towards myself and the world has been predominantly shaped through my struggles with professionally diagnosed ADHD &amp; depression. Curses that, in hindsight, I wish I had never been diagnosed with in the first place. Not because I don't believe they exist, but because labeling myself has led me down deep rabbit holes that have proved extremely hard to climb out of.\n\nI do not intend to lessen the significance of seeking help, nor do I intend to insult evidence-based treatment strategies. What I am merely suggesting is that, by attaching our self-worth and self image to these labels, we often unconsciously build self-constructs and sky-high walls that limit every aspect of our perception and viewpoint towards the world.\n\nFor me, labeling myself has led to my self destruction. I've started to believe every thought that came up in my head. I've started comparing myself to others, and grew hateful at myself for how far I am behind in life compared to my peers; I've lost confidence in my self, because how could I trust someone who's so pessimistic to cater for himself? I grew loathsome of the fact that I am breathing, and although I've never had suicidal tendencies before, I sometimes found myself thinking how much more forgiving it would be if I weren't alive here and now.\n\nI was judge, jury, and executioner.  Every single day, for a long time. It was one  of the lowest points in my life. I have trialed talk therapies, as well as biological interventions with stimulants and anti-depressants. Both therapies were mildly effective, with medication giving me terrible side effects that I had to quit. I thought, what else could there be? Was this it? It could not have been. There had to be something else that could help.\n\nAround a year ago, I started journaling, and wrote down some habits that I thought could be of help to me. The list contained general habits such as exercising, reading, breathwork, etc.. So, slowly, I started ticking off the list one by one over the upcoming months. I began with exercise. Habitual strength training led to cardio drills, which in turn led to a flexibility routine. Whenever something became habitual in my life, I'd fill my list with more aspired healthy habits that I thought I would enjoy.\n\nI've known about meditation, but I had doubts at the back of my mind. So, I read Peak Mind and Altered Traits, books that have both been written by academia neuroscientists researching meditation in their labs. And by following the instructions in their books, I dove fully in with no particular expectations. The first week I did 5 minute sessions, upped to 10 the following week, which became 15 - 20 by the end of the month. I am now comfortably doing a single 30 minute daily meditation session, with some days having two sessions up to an hour max.\n\nIn my practice, I alternate between interoceptive meditation objects, which get me deeper, and are more accessible and satisfying such as the breath and the body, and exteroceptive objects such as sounds, visuals, and dilated vision which are more grounding but can be dull at times. At first, I mentally could not wait for the sit time to end, but nowadays I feel annoyed when my timer ends and my alarm rings. During longer sits I have experienced amazing visual hallucinations, alterations of consciousness, out of body experiences, and meta cognitive awareness that I never dreamt of.\n\nTo just sit there, and do nothing, yet to be able to experience such calmness and bliss is contradictory. I've never thought it possible. No over-hyping intended, but out of all my accumulated habits, meditation has had the biggest impact on my well-being in such a short time it's actually mind-boggling.\n\n* I'm still a victim to mind wandering and mental loop holes, but I am much more aware of it now. Instead of a depressive mind wandering session that can mess up my entire day, I am able to regulate my emotions much more easily and ride the wave.\n* Whereas I could not hold steady attention to save my life, my ability to sit and mentally focus on a single task has grown substantially. Learning comprehension, short-term memory, mental arithmetic and problem solving have been sharpened and are more accessible than ever before.\n* Social interactions have gained a new dimension due to improved active listening and communication skills. I actively care, seek, and openly showcase love to all.  I don't push people away as much as I did when I experience mood swings.\n* Bad days have become like rough waves. They're no longer an unstoppable tsunami. I ride them out, knowing I'll get to shore safely, and I hope for better days ahead.\n* There's a glass. It's half full. Sometimes half empty. It does not matter. It'll always be there. It's how we look that matters.",

    "all_comment_text": "Proud of you OP and happy for you\n\nGreat read. You are a great writer sir and I'm very happy for your perspective on life.\n\nThank you for your kind words! &lt;3\n\nVery beautiful shortread! Will sent this to some disbelievers out there :)\n\nThanks fo sharing !\n\nCould you please elaborate on the following ?\n\n&gt; During longer sits I have experienced amazing visual hallucinations, alterations of consciousness, out of body experiences, and meta cognitive awareness that I never dreamt of.\n\nImagine being very engaged in a movie, only to realise you‚Äôre actually sitting in a movie theatre. The movie is one interesting reality, but ultimately your point of reference is not the same when you outwardly look from the perspective of a mere viewer. It‚Äôs almost like a shift of POV. Think third person and first person. \n\nThat‚Äôs essentially the essence of meta awareness. To realize that our realities are built upon lived experiences. And that those experiences can be experienced in different ways. \n\nVisually, when I set certain physical objects such as a vase, a texture, and other items as meditation focus objects, and sit longer periods, colours become more vivid, patterns begin to appear and I start to notice things I haven‚Äôt seen before in, and around the meditation object. \n\nIt‚Äôs almost as if my mind is in free flow, creating a new perspective on the object every passing moment. It‚Äôs the same process that allowed alternations of consciousness. Focusing on interoceptive subjective energy centres in the body such as the pineal gland, I have felt that I can dissociate completely. I can use the energy to shift my perception into and from new locations of physical consciousness. \n\nNot sure if it makes perfect sense, there‚Äôs a lack of words in the vocabulary that can describe the experience in all its vivid nature, but I hope I did enough.\n\nThis kind of experience cannot be shared in its fullness, it‚Äôs the kind of thing you have to experience for yourself\n\nYou made some very lucid and cogent points that I inwardly already knew ...but not as succinctly. Now I do. Thank you for sharing.\n\nGlad to have helped!\n\nKeep going and it can get better and better.\n\nwell done! such a nice motivation for me to get back my meditation routine\n\nYou have been blessed to have these type of inner peace realizations. I myself have experienced a lot of the same turbulence that you described; almost like I have written it myself. It gave me an ‚Äúaha‚Äù moment. i have always blamed others for my demise in life when in actuality it was my dark mind that was responsible for my negative actions and not because of what someone has said or done to me. I have meditated for years and it has changed my life in ways that I have made me a more peaceful person. That inner peace that I gained through meditation has made me a better person. I live my life with less attachment and with less anxiety. Enjoy the ride to a happier life. Too many people go through life thinking he who has the most toys wins. He who is at peace with whatever happens is the real winner.\n\nGood for you! It‚Äôs amazing how limiting our concept of self can be. Meditation has caused a very freeing dissociative effect for myself and the outcome has counterintuitively allowed me to achieve more as my attachment to outcomes has lessened.\n\nYou have inspired me to take up meditation.\n\nGo for it. You won‚Äôt regret it.\n\nposts like these bring back optimism in me :)\n\nVery well explained. I can relate to it\n\nTouching and inspirational!\n\nBeautiful insights, thank you for taking the time to share some details of your experience! Smoking for you, and saving to return to later.\n\nWow. Excellent post. Thanks for sharing, and so happy to hear it's working for you.üôè ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\n*Snaps* ü´∞ *Snaps* good read. Inspiring even. Thank you\n\nThanks for sharing. :)\n\nSuch a wonderful feeling, the detachment from your physical body and the beginnings of the understanding of the mind-body experience \nCongratulations \nGet RUINED\n\nGreat work! Thanks for sharing.\n\nBeautiful ‚ú®\n\nDo you have any links to favourite meditations?\n\nThe book Peak Mind by Amishi Jha has multiple introductory methods on meditation that suited me as a beginner. The podcast of Andrew Huberman on meditation has some really helpful information as well. Without these two resources, I wouldn‚Äôt know where to begin.\n\nReally great post. I have had a similar path to you, but you're able to articulate it so well.\n\nHey, I just wanted to thank you for sharing your insights. It‚Äôs incredibly helpful and hopeful to read you. I am definitely going to look into the books you mentioned, as I might find them helpful for my journey too.\n\nAnyway, glad to know that your are finding your inner peace. As you say, it‚Äôs just about finding your way and ride the wave.\n\nThanks for sharing in such cogent detail, well done on your practice and growth ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nWould you recommend those books to someone looking to start their meditation journey? I really want to, and have tried, but I feel like I don't know what I'm doing, or don't know if what I'm doing is correct.\n\n100%. Peak Mind and The Mind Illuminated provide specific instructions and meditation methods, while Altered Traits focuses more on the benefits of the practice. As I've mentioned in another reply too, a podcast by Andrew Huberman on meditation which is lengthy but worth listening to is as comprehensive as it can be and is built upon the concepts of these books.\n\nVery well put and amazing writing! We are all on this journey together and may you gain more peace and wisdom in this world.\n\nBest wishes for you, OP\n\nI have been struggling with a rough mental phase since 3-4 years now. \n\n&gt;Bad days have become like rough waves. They're no longer an unstoppable tsunami. I ride them out\n\nThis brings hope to me. \n\nCould you mentioned you meditate? Do you focus on breath or any outside guide? \n\nI have been trying to meditate by chanting some stotras myself or listening to them on phone. But idk if that's the right way to do it\n\nThe breath, sounds, a single object, sometimes I just sit there. No matter the object, the most important thing is to notice yourself wandering and re-direct your attention. There's not a single right way, nor are there wrong ways. Think of meditation as a mental exercise. Exercise comes in all shapes and forms. There's running, weightlifting, calisthenics, boxing, and hundreds of others. All of them are beneficial in some way, and all have their merit. It's sort of similar. I'd recommend you read through the methods of meditation that Amishi Jha recommends in Peak Mind and explore them thoroughly. The Flashlight has become a favorite of mine.\n\n&gt;Amishi Jha recommends in Peak Mind and explore them thoroughly\n\nI will go through this. \n\n\nThanks so much. I hope you continue to find peace with this process. Amazing progress, OP. \n\nMind negativity can be self sabotaging as you mentioned and it's exhausting.\n\nIt really can be. That 30 minutes of relief every day will always be precious. And the resilience the practice builds, oh my, I can't help but cherish it.\n\nAs a fellow ADHD sufferer, I just can never get a good practice going üò™¬†\n\nI have one of the worst cases of attention deficit you can imagine, yet if I don't practice daily my day is simply not the same as when I have practiced. There are multiple angles to establishing a healthy practice. The how, and the consistency aspect of things. \n\nWhen it comes to consistency, there's no willing yourself into meditation. Willpower and rawdogging do not work alone here. If you read The Mind Illuminated by Culdasa, he points out that the only way to be consistent at meditation is to enjoy it. If you find that your sessions are becoming boring, re-orient your perspective to find alternatives on how you could enjoy the practice. \n\nOn my daily calendar, \"Meditation\" repeats every single day. Crossing it off this way helps maintain that I stay consistent at it. When it comes to the how, read the books I've highlighted, and check out The Mind Illuminated too while you're at it. They offer a variety of meditation methods that can appeal to ADHD.\n\nAnd remember, the point is NOT to stay focused at all times, it's to notice your mind wandering and to re-direct attention, softly and consciously to the meditation object when that happens. If you wander 100 times, yet you re-orient your attention 101 times, that's a win.\n\nGood for you man!! I am glad it helped :)\n\nProud of you\n\nWow that was amazing\nThank you for sharing it with us ‚ú®\nI'm experiencing the same mental breakdowns as u did and I have always thought about meditation but never could actually do it\nCan you please guide me about how I can start meditation and stop my mind from wandering off?\nThanks üôè\n\nPatience for starters, friend. Improvements in practice are never linear. Even authors on the topic recommend you go in with no expectations. If your sole purpose for meditating is to relieve yourself from suffering, you unexpectedly pursue suffering. To accept the present moment in all its characteristics is the most important element of the practice. Start slow, very slow, and intend to enjoy the practice. The point of meditation is not to stop the mind from completely wandering. That is unrealistic. The point is to notice when you ARE wandering. That's a very important difference that is very well highlighted in the books I've mentioned above, and I can not stress how detrimental they were to the success I've seen with the practice.\n\nThank you very much for the insight ‚ò∫Ô∏è\n\nThank you for sharing your experiences. Would you say your physical exercise helped you in any way to engage in meditation practices?\n\nComing off habit-less living, I feel like staying consistent with exercise has helped reciprocate the consistency in my meditation practice.\n\nThat‚Äôs great to hear. But how do you tame your wandering mind during meditation?!\n\nSee, the funny thing is, you‚Äôre not supposed to tame it. You‚Äôre simply asked to follow it wherever it goes, and be non-judgmental about where it leads you. Whenever your attention strays, you simply bring it back to the meditation object that you chose at the beginning of the session. The main objective is not to have a mind that never wanders, it‚Äôs to be aware that you‚Äôre wandering, and to control shifting back your attention to where you intend consciously.\n\nThanks. And how long should one meditate?  And how to set a meditation object? Do we imagine things?\n\nStart slow. And gradually add time once sits become comfortable. It‚Äôs not the length that matters at the beginning, it‚Äôs the intention and the consistency in practice. \n\nI‚Äôd recommend 5 - 10 minutes daily for the first week. Increased incrementally based upon your appetite for the practice. Never force. Go with what you feel. You‚Äôll feel uneasy at first, but stick with it and practice diligently. It‚Äôs like going to the gym, but for your brain. \n\nAs for the meditation object, you can choose anything! You can timely alternate focus between multiple objects throughout a long sit. You can choose breath sensations, white noise, body sensations, a focal point in front of you, the flame of a candle, anything really. The most important thing is that once you set something as the focus object, you must wilfully return to it after you notice your mind wandering. \n\nYou may find yourself returning to the object tens of times in the beginning. All the merrier! The more you return to it, the more you‚Äôre building mental resilience. That‚Äôs the entire point! \n\nI really really recommend you check out some of the resources I‚Äôve mentioned in my other replies. They expand on everything I am saying in much more detail! \n\nBest of luck!\n\nThanks bro! I‚Äôd try to implement it during my meditation. Any app you use for this?\n\nThis was a super inspiring read.\n\nI wish you all the best on your continued journey with meditation!\n\nHey so I'm occasionally doing guided meditations for anxiety. But I'm not consistent. Would you say it helps with clinical depression\n\npalousemindfulness.com\n\nAccording to research, the MBSR mindfulness program is as effective as medication for depression. The website above has everything you need to know about the practice.\n\nThank you friend\n\nIt's amazing how some people can do 30 minutes of meditation so effortlessly. 15 minutes for me feel like victory.\n\nEven 10 minutes was very difficult for me when I first started. It‚Äôs a ladder, climb at your own pace :)\n\nI love that last bullet point and how you brought the post full-circle. bravo OP\n\nCould someone verify what books these are (authors, links to title)? I want to undergo this journey but I'm on a budget.\n\nNo need to have a budget, friend! All of the books are salvageable for a [worthy pirate.](http://libgen.rs)\n\nIs this where I can download the books? Or just find them to read? I look up Peaked mind and nothing comes up. Sorry I‚Äôm new to thisü§£\n\nLucky you. Meditation has done fuck all for me the past few years, and my mental state just continues to deteriorate.\n\nThat was beautiful. I have recently turned to meditation and affirmations to heal emotional wounds and generational trauma. Not there yet but the days are becoming more abd more tolerable. I just refuse to be depressed. I know I got this.\n\nI started meditating¬† about 2 months ago,\nI have felt amazing and have seen the results.The energy you put out is the energy you recieve.The universe is an amazing place and the power of the mind is also truly amazing. I have listened¬† to different¬† podcast and have read about the brain and it's just a matter of rewiring your thinking instead of seeing problems try to see solutions.Just carving out a little¬† time for your mind can go a long way,and just like anything¬† else the more you do it the better you get at it. It takes work and perseverance¬† but the results will speak for themselves¬†\n\nIch¬†\n\nI loved your story. Especially the labeling causing us to become the disease. Disease is real, it‚Äôs a thing to be sure. Attaching and grasping at the label. I love your Analysis!\n\nI‚Äôve been meditating for a little over two years, I didn‚Äôt quit, and am realizing many benefits you mention!!\n\nü´Ç‚ù§Ô∏èü™∑\n\nBeautiful to hear! I am also formally diagnosed with ADHD and depression... and often feel super behind compared to my peers as well. I agree with you about the danger of adopting these as labels/identities... it's sort of a complicated feeling, but while I acknowledge that I experience the symtomology of ADHD and depression, I didn't want to think of myself as a person with ADHD and depression, therefore I'm cursed to be this way. \n\nI just recently began my meditation practice after attending a retreat. I'm at almost a week of 30-minute meditation everyday. Of course my mind still wanders, but now I have a way of returning to peace. Thank you for sharing your journey, it gives me hope."

    "title": "How 1.5 years into meditation changed me",
    "body": "Hey everyone!\n\nI‚Äôd like to share how meditation has changed my life. About 1.5 years ago, I began meditating daily, aiming for at least 15 minutes across one or two sessions. I also keep a daily journal, reflecting on my experiences, realizations, night dreams, and memorable moments. Most of all, I focus on trying to stay present throughout my day.\n\nI decided to list these changes as a way to mark my progress. Sometimes, it can feel like I'm moving slowly, but writing everything down reminded me just how far I've come. I hope this list inspires someone on their own journey.\n\n1. Meditation has deepened my self-awareness, which in turn has helped me understand others better. Now, I can recognize psychological patterns and emotions in people that I would have overlooked before.\n\n2. In relationships, my love used to be focused more on what I needed. Now, I genuinely care about my partner‚Äôs happiness; it‚Äôs as important as my own.\n\n3. I (32M) never wanted kids and I still don't want them, but I feel a newfound openness to nurturing and guiding others, which connects back to my experience of altruistic love. I think I'd love to grow a child with love and care.\n\n4. Since I was 16, I struggled with persistent suicidal thoughts, something therapy alone couldn‚Äôt resolve. Amazingly, meditation has almost eliminated these thoughts, something I never believed possible.\n\n5. I‚Äôve come to accept life, and even death, as they are. This was challenging at first, especially while dealing with past suicidal thoughts, but as they faded, this acceptance has brought me peace.\n\n6. I‚Äôm more centered on my life and happiness, rather than letting small daily irritations consume me.\n\n7. I feel less rushed. Whether driving or standing in line, I‚Äôm present and aware, accepting that I can‚Äôt change traffic or make a queue go faster. As a result, I‚Äôm less frustrated and experience less anger.\n\n8. Parts of my ego have softened. I‚Äôm less jealous, and I no longer feel the need to argue my point just to prove I‚Äôm \"right\".\n\n9. I enjoy food more and eat slower. Before meditation, it was hard to stay focused just on eating, but now each meal is an experience.\n\n10. With greater presence, I remember more details about situations, which makes life richer and more vivid.\n\nTo everyone here, I wish you all the best on your journeys. I hope my experiences resonate with you or bring encouragement to anyone just starting out. Thank you for reading, and may you find peace and growth along the way.\n\nEdit: Thank you all for your support and for sharing your experiences! Here are two bonus benefits I've noticed since I started practicing. 11. I sleep better as I can \"switch off\" my mind. 12. By becoming more aware of my habits, I've significantly reduced my time on social media. I feel way better without the doom scrolling!",

    "all_comment_text": "I'm glad this helped you so much! Meditation is great\n\nI love to read this. Thank you for sharing! I just started meditating every morning and am 34 days in. I love to read your progress over 1.5 year and even though I already am motivated to continue this for a long time regardless of what my experiences will be, this adds a little bit of extra motivation.¬†\n\nI am also 34 days in!! What kind of meditation do you practice?\n\nLove it!! I mostly alternate between a body scan, meditation with just focusing on my breath or sometimes I use a candle and I try to focus on the candle. I use the candle if I notice that I‚Äôm too much in my head to focus on my breath and I need an object to keep my focus.¬†\n\nWhat about you and what are your experiences?¬†\n\nI have been using guided meditations, I alternate between body scans or Sadhguru Isha kriya \"I am not the body, not even the mind\". A candle as a focus is something I will try as I'm particularly in my head at moment. I'm also trying to detach from my thoughts throughout the day when I can, just recognising the little wins for taking a breath and observing. Still feel disappointed when I drift away with my thoughts and it can be hard to know how long I've drifted away for but bringing myself back gently and being kind to myself is still something I'm learning.\n\nIt is definitely challenging. I like to think of it as: if it would be easy, everyone would do it. I am currently in a burnout, and as difficult as I find this period, it has made me realize that the world still goes on when you are a bit kinder to yourself. Nothing changes. But I also know that it doesn't matter who says that to you ‚Äî you have to feel it inside yourself to truly believe it. \n\nI will look into Sadhguru Isha Kriya. Good luck and all the best on your journey!\n\nIt's a burnout that brought me here also, feels like such a privilege to take the time each day for myself. Thank you, same to you! Hope to hear when you reach 100days :-)\n\nWhat exactly in meditation? Breathing exercises?\n\nYes, breathing meditation and focusing on the inner energy\n\nDid you use an app to start or not? Like how did your meditation journey and discovery started? What did you use in the beginning, like an app, or YouTube, or some sort of guided meditation (if any), and did you continue using or not?\n\nI didn't use any app. I discovered the potential of meditation reading a book. Then I started practicing by myself, reading other books about the topic and reading other people's experiences online (like here on Reddit).\n\nAny suggestions on where to start with this method? Books or videos? Thanks!\n\nTo begin, I suggest \"Practising the Power of Now\" by Eckhart Tolle. It's direct, concise, and explains a couple of meditation techniques. But there are tons of very good books suggested in this subreddit!\n\nMaybe look into Transcendental Meditation. Simple, really explains some things and also requires almost nothing of you except to remember your mantra. I started TM not knowing what I was getting into. I just started doing it out of desperation for change, hoping it would calm my anxieties. What actually happened within the next five months was... Well you have a very good insight a few paragraphs above. I've had a moment of clarity tonight and it's made me realize what I've been missing for a while now. Good luck to everyone.\n\nA constant state of self awareness and bringing back attention to one thought or gor beginner on their breathing from all the mindful distraction thoughts, doing it long term boosts ur self awareness and attention so that ur mind will not wander\n\nIt‚Äôs helpful to see someone‚Äôs results!  I struggle with staying consistent, but these are the things I‚Äôm trying to change!  \nAppreciate you sharing your insight üíú\n\nIt's funny that depending ~~of~~ on where you are in life, results can happen way sooner. For the past month ~~of~~ or so I've been focusing on my thoughts and the feelings associated with them, that alone made me more present and I'm getting a lot of the same results OP is talking about. Obviously there is still a lot to work on.\n\nIf you are like me and struggle to be consistent with sitting down meditation, work on mindfulness through your day. Don't be too hard on yourself. You can start at any moment.\n\nAre you still meditating 15 minutes per day? Have you gone on any retreats?\n\nThis is a lovely reflection and I find it encouraging to keep with the practice myself. Thank you for sharing.\n\nYeah, sometimes it can be 30 minutes, sometimes 10, but I try to be consistent.\n\nI went to a 4-day retreat at the beginning of my journey and I had an amazing experience. However, the retreat wasn't seated meditation all the time. We did a lot of exercises like walking meditation, a very slow-walk meditation, guided meditations with mental images, meditation around a fire... (Sorry if I can't name all these exercises properly!)\n\nWow amazing thanks for sharing ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏èI have been meditating for minimum of 10 minutes a day and also notice slight changes I love\n\nGreat structured thought and results. Very impressive. Btw, kids are great entities that keep us evolving further)\n\nThis is what meditation is all about\n\nAbsolutely fantastic. Thank you for sharing x\n\nGreat post! Did you use any tools to meditate? Like guided videos or soundscapes? Really struggling to switch my mind off and get distracted during breathing exercises\n\nI feel you! At the beginning of my journey, the first 10‚Äì15 minutes were the hardest. After that however, something clicked and I felt relaxed all of a sudden. My mind \"switched off\".\n\nIt's okay to be distracted and to have your mind bouncing between thoughts. Just be there to experience it, accept what your mind is doing without judging. When you \"get back\" from losing your attention, try to observe how much time you spent \"away\", what triggered it and what was your stream of thoughts.\n\nThat's so helpful thank you! I feel better knowing it's all part of the experience learning about recognising the distractions. I feel encouraged to keep going and try push past that 15 minute point! Thanks for your help! ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nHow bout your social and financial life?\n\nI'm more mindful about my friendships. In my early 30s, many friendships tend to shift, and I've learned to accept these changes. I‚Äôm also more willing to invest in friendships without feeling strained. Spending time with friends and doing things for them, like cooking or offering help, makes me genuinely happy.\r\n\r\nI broke up with my girlfriend after a year in meditation (3-year relationship), although I'm not sure how much of that decision was influenced by meditation. What I do know is that I feel content with the outcome, as I'm now with someone who is more aware of her own mind and intentions.\r\n\r\nFinancially, I haven‚Äôt changed jobs, but my perspective on work has shifted. I now see my role as just a job, rather than something that defines me. I‚Äôm an R&amp;D chemist, not saving lives, and I‚Äôm okay with that. I've also become less materialistic and stopped buying unnecessary things. I no longer rely on possessions or shopping for happiness; I‚Äôve found fulfillment elsewhere. Now, I can save money for retirement or even consider donating.\n\nI am just starting my journey. What did you do to prevent your next and back from becoming tired?\n\nA lot of people suggest that you should be seated with your back not supported, but the most important thing is keeping a position that is comfortable to you.\n\nI can't resist too much with my back not supported for example. However, during meditation, I can focus on the pain and understand perfectly what my body and my muscles need.\n\nHeck yeah man love to hear it\n\nWhat is the easiest way to start meditating please?\n\nHey, honestly, I have only really been successful at it when guided in person so once a week, at best. So I know starting is the hardest part, and I am struggling with it too, but if this makes sense, it gets me to do more sessions randomly and I hope that if I keep doing this it will turn into a habit: I have to surprise my brain and just decide to do sit down, back straight, comfortably firm, and focus one spot then close your eyes and for me I just pretend I am looking down the end of my nose where the breath is coming from and going out and then do that for a few minutes. The meditation part starts when you notice you stopped focusing on the end of your nose and are thinking of something else and then - and this is important - instead of beating yourself up for getting distracted, giggle a bit and laugh internally at how hard this is, I always get an image of trying to grab a bunch of monkeys at the same time before going back to focusing on the end of my nose and trying to refocus on the breathing - long, slow in, longer, slower breath out. The work of meditation is practicing getting back to focus and then trying to get longer and longer periods of that focus time instead of distracting thoughts time‚Ä¶at first major storms of disrupting thoughts and then taming those thoughts with gentleness and self compassion until that helps start a new phase‚Ä¶anyways, that‚Äôs my trick but I suck at remembering to do it. So hopefully I get to trick myself enough so that it gets to a habit that I really start to get the benefits like OP. Every session is good. Getting regular sessions that build off each other is better. Peace.\n\nThanks for sharing! Yeah, the key is consistency in observing oneself. Everyone's experience can also be different!\n\nDoes there is any change in you related to energy and thinking patterns after this???\n\nYeah, absolutely. I can recognize thinking patterns, I'm aware of all of them! I'm more peaceful and peace comes from the inner energy.\n\nAny suggestion to reduce anxiety and brain fog... experiencinh from past 1 year making my life miserable.\n\nI'm sorry to hear that. Meditation and mindfulness take time to come to help and may not be the answer for anyone. You can still try to clear your mind. Hope you all the best.\n\nVery impressive thoughts. It's good seeing people got to this by meditation and how every person has their unique journey and experiences.\n\nWow, so many good benefits! I can confirm your experiences because I've have received similar benefits from my own meditative practice. I practice mettƒÅ by chanting mantras. Thank you for kind wishes and may you continue to progress on the path. Much kindness!\n\nThank you so much\n\nThanks for sharing. I can second all you say. It‚Äôs great to see others create posts like this because even though it takes a long time it‚Äôs hard to believe it works. Especially when you‚Äôve a thought that you‚Äôll never get better! I‚Äôve been through many resources and find the Waking Up apps amazing\n\n[removed]\n\nNot really. I found one ambient sound that I like, nothing particular, it just helps my mind to understand it's time to meditate!\n\nHow long do you meditate nowadays ? I mean per day\n\n15‚Äì20 minutes in one session or two sessions of 10‚Äì15 minutes\n\nDo try increasing it\n\nCan you elaborate on your journaling and its contribution to the benefits? I am feeling a need to incorporate this.\n\nMeditation and mindfulness helped me see things more clearly, while journaling helped me understand better how I feel related to what's happening in my life. Journaling also allowed me to create links between what happens everyday and my past traumas.\n\nFor me, meditation builds awareness. Awareness is a tool that can be used in every moment, but using it while journaling can give you a better understanding of yourself.\n\nmeditation changed me too i stopped talking to everyone and went into isolation idont kno why I can't open up the thoughts are loud asf, i dont even resalise\n\nThank you for being so honest to share your experience and emotions to us! I‚Äôm very impressed and encouraged! I‚Äôve tried meditating but quitted in few days for many times, with many excuses (my bad). I really want to know how to keep it done consistently‚Ä¶ üò¢\n\nYoga truly gifts the benefit of focus on mind, body and spirit. I believe that yoga, as well as meditation, is a practice, and the frequency of the practicing of yoga and meditation is important. I have benefitted greatly by going to the Y and taking classes from three different instructors on a weekly basis, each with their own unique teaching approaches. I am more focused and have learned to meditate‚Ä¶ I love it and I hope this gives someone encouragement to try it too !\n\n[removed]\n\nIt can vary for each person. For many, including myself, 10 minutes right after waking up and another 10 minutes in the evening when you're back home works best. I think the best approach is to try different methods and times until you find what works best for you!\n\nI had suicidal thoughts too..meditation really helps ppl who have depression a lot....also dont want u to feel discouraged but after 2-3 years that nurturing feeling doent go away but u urself move it in the background and dont tell every single person u meet that meditation is the way and its good for them...cuz I feel we feel after a while that everyone has their own journey and iffff anyone need that advice they'll show or ask....thats how it is for me dunno others\n\nAlso that good feeling and being changed I think looses its light but we must remember the old person who lived our life and not feel bad for everything turning normal..although amazingly good but normal\n\nAnyway congrats on the lovely life and continue meditating\n\nGlad you shared this bro. I‚Äôve been procrastinating getting in to meditation for a fair few weeks after reading ‚ÄúBreaking the habit of being yourself‚Äù but reading your post has given me some extra motivation to get started.\n\nI'm reading that book right now! I just finished the first part\n\nDo you feel overall happier/more content in life?\n\nI'd definitely say so\n\nMeditation has helped me immensely on the suicidal thoughts and my addiction problems, when therapy hasn‚Äôt helped for years.\n\ncool story bro, ggwp\n\ntwitchat language for awesome and am so happy for you :) \n\nit's truly an amazing practice\n\nI love this for you!!"

    "body": "Just wanted to share a list of things that I have noticed since I started daily 8 months ago. \n1) I am able to identify and separate most of my emotions. Anxiety, fear and Anger are mostly gone in my day to day life. \n2) I am able to read the vibe of the room or other people. Not sure how to describe this but when out in public I get a feeling of the vibe coming from other people or just the feel of the crowd. Joy, stress , worry. I tend to pick up on it just by being present and observing. \n3) I have become more compassionate and peaceful. And also realizing that the world is such a violent place with so much suffering I do not want to do anything to cause more suffering to anyone. I am trying to improve myself to be a better person to other people\n4) I no longer fear death and would be ready to face it and accept with my eyes open. \n5) I know that there is way more to us as beings than just our body and current life. It cannot be understood or explained. But it is something that I now for the footsteps time in my 54 years in that I have faith in. Just gotta trust the process. \n\nAnd if you showed me this post 1 year ago I would have said this person is insane!  How quickly things can change\n",

    "all_comment_text": "This is a beautiful mindset, and that faith aspect is incredibly important. It allows you to walk life having trust you are on the right path. It sounds like you are more attuned to life and the reality before you, which will make you happier and enjoy your life more.\n\nThanks for posting this.\n\n\"And if you showed me this post 1 year ago I would have said this person is insane! How quickly things can change\"\n\nSuch is the ego afraid of losing command. Congrats!\n\nI would really like to succeed but I'm having a lot of difficulties. Where do I start? Quiet place? Position? Mantra Jap ü§™ I really try but it doesn't seem to work very well at the moment. Any advice is welcome\n\nI would suggest download the 1 giant mind app and don‚Äôt try and trust that your true self will find the way. It‚Äôs your ego self stepping back and letting you true self find its way. Best quote about this is ‚Äúeveryone is on their own spiritual path and if yours is clear you are probably on someone else‚Äôs path\n\nTry a dark, quiet place, light a candle, and find a gentle or kid's guided meditation for 5 minutes. It works for me when I can't quite get \"there\". It will happen, it just takes a little practice and willingness. NAMASTE Baby\n\nOn point one, how had the anxiety and anger gone?  It'll be interesting to find out! I've been meditating for 1.5 years and generally that is the case. But there are certain anxieties which seem to reside deeply and meditation has made me more aware but I'm not sure it helps me deal with then.  Would be grateful if you could talk through how it helped with anxiety and anger. Thanks!\n\nNot to butt in, but I cleared some crowd anxiety I had by putting hypnotic suggestions for confidence, and courage in crowds while I was in meditation. It was the first time trying something like that. I sort of forgot I did it, but next time I was in a crowd it was super comfortable. I wondered why a bit until I recalled I had programmed that in. It has stuck with me too.\n\nCan you explain the hypnotic suggestions a bit further? I did exposure therapy for a severe phobia and it mostly worked, but I recently realized I was slipping and reacting to thoughts of it again. Meditation has helped and I want to get back into it, but I want a more guided approach.\n\nYes, glad to. The hypnotic suggestion is your choosing, but make sure it is positive. For example, if you had fear of heights, you should not suggest, \"I'm not afraid of heights.\", but rather something like, \"I am calm, confident, and comfortable at heights\"\n\nYou set the intent to do this before you start the meditation/self-hypnosis session. Write it down even, and read it before starting. One can forget the intention sometimes. Just do it over if that happens. Start your meditation and when your mind seems to have reached that relaxed state, put in your hypnotic suggestions.\n\nInteresting!\n\nSometimes I write in my journal something I call ‚Äùvision‚Äù; where I imagine coming into work, meeting friends or whatever; and I emulate a state of mind where I feel joyful, relaxed and present. When it was part of my daily routine in the evenings it surely helped with anxiety and also to become more present and joyful\n\nIs this like \"manifesting\" and apart from helping you become more joyful (from the inside), did it affect the external?  So interesting.\n\nI‚Äôm sure it affects aspects of both; how you react to the environment and perhaps affecting your connection with others\n\nNot completely gone. There are a few tough triggers that come up and like you ,I notice that way more. Gratefully those are not my everyday stressors but when they do come up I try to do the same thing I do to a thought when it enters my mind in meditation and try to make it separate from emotion.\n\nThank you for sharing insights! I want to practice Meditation, but I have OCD. Some people in Reddit mentioned that they had negative effects due to the meditation. What‚Äôs your perspective on the correlation of OCD with Meditation?\n\nI struggled with OCD as yonger person, and again as an adult when presented with very stressful situations.\n\nFor me my anxiety triggered OCD looped thoughts and rumination. I would then use constant stimulation (video games/browsing the web) to try and hide from it. Whist this gave tempory relief is was not solving the issue.\n\nAfter watching a video series on OCD, I realised that my anxiety was triggering the sympathetic nervous system (fight or flight response) and it was supressing my rational/logical thinking part of my brain (and this is when I would get completely stuck in rumination/looped thoughts).\n\nThe key is to relealise when this happens and (meditation practice is great at building this awareness skill). And then apply a countermeasure to this anxiety.\n\nFor me I wanted to activate the parasympathetic nervous system (rest and digest mode). The quickest way of doing this is breathwork (where the out breath is longer than the in breath). Several minuites of this and my rational/logical part of my brain is restored.\n\nHere is the video series on OCD:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSKjMRaWVQ1oxi4cIyFDrEIGqiEkJIhf6](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSKjMRaWVQ1oxi4cIyFDrEIGqiEkJIhf6)\n\nIt recommends both breathwork and a mindfullness style of meditation (which acts as a kind of exposure therapy to the OCD/anxiety).\n\nPersonally building awareness via meditation has masivly reduced my OCD tendancys.\n\nYou might also want to learn more about OCD treatments from a Licenced OCD and anxiety theripst:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/@ocdandanxiety](https://www.youtube.com/@ocdandanxiety)\n\nI think you would really benefit from checking out the concept of samskaras if you haven‚Äôt already.\n\nI've been meditating off and on for almost 20 years, as well as studying and practicing Buddhism, so I know what you mean. It's crazy to think during your first year(s) that you're getting anywhere, then one day you look back and realize that you're not the same person anymore, and your outlook on life is new too. It's so amazing isn't it?! Congratulations on making it this far, most people either don't see the progress, or don't accept what they see within and give up. \n KEEP SMILING!!!\n\nThis is inspirational. Thank you\n\nYou're welcome. It's nice too see other people keep with the practice because sometimes it's hard to get past the doubts and 'why bothers' of it all. \n   And I'm not sure if it's weird to reply to your reply, I'm new to reddit, or for that matter any social media at all. So I'm happy that my first ever comment was inspirational. Thank-you.\n\nWould you mind sharing your experience? Are you participating on a Buddhism group or doing on your own? Did you go on any meditation retreat?\n\nI got into Buddhism though a friend and basically have been practicing on my own. I've read a lot of books by Thich Nhat Hahn, G.K Gyatso, Pema Chodrom ect. I did have a a small meditation group with teachings with a Buddhist nun for almost 2 years in like 2004. But pretty much practice on my own. Haven't been on any retreats.\n\nI gauge my progress by how deep I can enter jahnas...there are 8 levels. Meditation is a mirror which showed the purity of our mind and the wisdom to see reality.\n\nYes I do agree, By the regular practice of yoga meditation, it can greatly reduce tension and stress and overcome anxiety, worry, and other disturbances of the mind. It helps to calm the mind &amp; experience inner peace.\n\nHow long do you meditate for each day? Have you done the same amount for the last 8 months or has it increased?\n\nWhen did you start to notice significant changes that could not be explained by placebo?\n\nStarted with 12 minutes a day for about a month. The 20 minutes for another month or so and then 30minutes. I‚Äôm think about upping to 40 minutes soon. After about 2 months I started really noticing a difference. I remember for a while my anxiety which used to cause anger and frustration started causing confusion. Like I knew it was a stressful situation and I guess In was waiting for all of the shit that comes along with it and it didn‚Äôt come. I was confused on how to feel. So I dealt with the problems from a non emotional place and realized you can actually make better decisions from a neutral emotional state. My  practice is different but I always focus on a single point. Sometimes that‚Äôs breath sometimes it‚Äôs mantra and sometimes it‚Äôs prayer\n\nYou are more advanced in meditation than me, but many say that if you just sit with the feeling of anxiety without seeking reasons, and not judging it, it will dissipate until gone. \n\nA psychological technique is to get into theta state and ask the anxiety what it is while doing a body scan noting how it manifests in the body. While relaxing the body parts effected, often the source of the anxiety comes to mind.\n\nThat is beautiful.   Finding your true self and inner peace is a true blessing. \nI'm 65 in August and in the past 5 years have been getting into deep meditation and sound therapy.   Look up Paul Temple on YouTube \nHe plays the Tibetan Bowls and does throat singing, etc.\nHe loops it and it's pretty amazing. \nI actually went to a gathering last night and got to experience Paul live\nWhat a healing night it was.  \nYou are right about the world not being what it should be. \nIf people would wake up and see that there are ways to heal yourself without using the poisonous pharmaceuticals that are prescribed to anyone who is vulnerable to take them\nI highly believe in psychedelic therapy to heal the mind and connect with our soul.\nI'd plant medicine is used as medicine and a tool it can be life changing in a positive way.\nCombine sound therapy and plant medicine and it is nothing but a healing experience \nMuch love to you.\nStay in the Mindset \nA Positive Mindset is very important\n\nDon't forget ( especially for people who find it hard to just sit) when you become completely absorbed in whatever you are doing ( eg cycling, swimming, cleaning, gardening, listening to music,) and stop thinking, this is meditation also. Many people do this automatically without even realising it's a meditation.\n\nI agree. I have been meditating more consistently in the last year. I feel more grounded, centered and stable. I am so happy you shared, my experience is similar. I still have emotions, but I am able to process what they are, what triggered them and either how to avoid them or invite them. Instead of bursting out in tears, I can regulate my emotions and find a more appropriate time to let those tears out. I embrace instead of deflect life's events and circumstances. This is a much easier way to go thru life.\n\nI wa son olanzapien (don't know how to spell it) for a year or two I was 156 pounds and now that I'm off it I'm 122 pounds! It's been a journey but it really is freeing \nEdit: I thought it said medication sorry lol\n\n[removed]\n\n1/2 hour every morning. And try to be mindful through out the day.\n\nWow‚Ä¶ love this insight. Thanks for sharing!\n\nLove this, gotta trust the process!\n\n40 days into my meditation journey and it saves me from myself every day. Thanks for this!\n\nYour reflections are truly inspiring. Thanks for sharing!\n\nContemplative prayer and meditation has changed my life too. I owe it to Christ, however I enjoy listening to your perspective and story as well.\n\nYay! It has also affected me deeply in less than a year.\n\nSo happy to hear this. Meditation has been a game-changer in my mental health. I tell people often that it taught me how to truly love myself.\n\nLove this! I‚Äôm so glad you shared this, I think it‚Äôs important for us as humans to practice this. Just imagine if all of us did this, what the world would be if we were all peaceful loving beings‚Ä¶‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nI understand this. I am happy for you. I am proud of you ü´∂üèº\n\nWhat kind(s) of meditation do you do?\n\nCan you describe your practice-how did you start and how did it evolve?\n\nVery tough to put it in words but about 3 years ago I started looking at radical acceptance as a way to deal with anxiety. I liked the concept. Started down a spiritual journey- just really trying to understand who I am. Because I get them person that I was, was not the true version of me.  I then downloaded the I giant mind app to try meditation about A year ago and it all kinda of clicked and felt right.  For the past few months I have been learning about Buddhism and that too seems like it‚Äôs clicking. We will see where it all goes.  I am not sure what type of meditation I do as it seems to switch up but I always try to use a single point of focus.\n\nThanks for sharing. It is really very motivated. Could you share what technique do you use for it and how long do you do meditation for usually to see these benefits in a year? Thanks\n\nCongratulations!\n\nIt seems as though your life has improved. That's great!\n\nIt's awesome to hear how meditation can impact the lives of others. \n\nIt seems that you have a better outlook on life. Keep it up!\n\nThis is great. ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nLove this thank you\n\nAwesome. Drop your initial routine! Might work for some\n\nI think I can exactly relate to what you are saying. Specially the part on picking up the vibe in the room and I am still try trying to understanding how to deal with it? I am always questioning myself whether this is my inner response to the person in front of me or is it the person‚Äôs own mental state. The moment the person goes away I stop feeling those things.\n\nHow did you get started and how did you progress?\n\nThank you for sharing! You deserve this joy !! ‚ú®üíú‚ú®\n\nI still haven‚Äôt found my way around it. What‚Äôs the best way to start meditating and making it happen? I can‚Äôt seem to sit for more than 10 sec calmly. My anxieties and ADHD are always peaking\n\nI have adhd as well. I try to use it to my advantage as I think it‚Äôs easier for me to let go of a thought, granted lots of time there is another one right behind it. But there is a space between the thoughts and the more I do it the longer that space gets\n\nWhat form of mediation do you practice? Or what does your practice look like\n\nI try to focus on one thing, a single point that does not cause a negative emotion I change that single point up. Could be breath could be mantra. Could be a prayer, I like the Hail Mary.\n\nCan you tell me how you started? I desperately feel this is the path I am meant to take but didn't know how.\n\nI started with the 1 giant mind app and listen to a lot of Alan watts and Ram Dass. That set off my journey\n\nCan you share more about #4? It's something that I struggle with despite having many breakthroughs.  Do you really mean and think you'd be okay with it?\n\nYes, I have kinda of come to terms that I will die and I cannot control when. I start to look at life as an experience that Is occurring and like birth, death is part of that experience. And it seems like one would want to experience something that only happens once in a lifetime\n\nThank you for that explanation.  I'm going to try to incorporate that.  It's probably my biggest hurdle.\n\nHow did meditation assist with this thought? Did you feel or see anything during your meditation that made you feel at ease with death/dying?\n\nI did not see anything. It was all part of detaching emotion from thought. I now look at a lot of things differently. it let me look at it logically and it becomes easier to understand that it is not in my control. And that I really should not invest my emotions on things which I cannot control. Now who knows if the doctor tells me tomorrow I am dying It may fall apart but until then why worry\n\nI'm genuinely glad that meditation has shown you your true God self. I genuinely encourage you to do Ayahuasca ceremony. That itself will take you to a new level of awareness. Usually you feel the \"call\" to do it. Also magic mushroom. And the best part about magic mushroom is that you can grow it in you closet. There are many subreddits about shrooms and about psychedelics. We are god self experiencing a dream. Ones you do your first Ayahuasca ceremony(assuming you haven't done it) nothing will be the same. Peace upon your lovely spirit‚òÄÔ∏èüôèüèºüå∏\n\nAn inspiring post, rhankyou\n\nWhat a very thoughtful and meaningful post. The world will be a much better place as people read and implement this. Thank you.\n\nThanks man ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nThanks for sharing\n\nThis is very encouraging to me as I struggle with my practice as of late. Thank you so much for sharing! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nCould you share how often n how long you meditate?\n\nThat sounds like awesome insights. Could you share what your meditation practice looks like?\n\nThanks for sharing!\n\nMay I private message you regarding this meditation post? Please\n\nYes\n\nHow did you start meditation? I have been doing breathing exercises. Does it count under meditation?\n\nCheck out r/gatewaytapes\n\nI did a couple. Had to stop. Started feeling like brainwashing vs meditation.just my opinion though I know a few people that do them and love it\n\nI‚Äôve astral projected (left my physical body) using them . This will answer your unanswered questions . You are right. We are more than our physical bodies\n\nAmazing! How long and what do you meditate to/how? I get bad anxiety and would love to start but unsure how :(\n\nDo you have any specific meditations that you do ?\n\nIt sounds a bit like ‚Äôbeginners bliss‚Äô, however I‚Äôm happy for you and wish it to keep growing\n\nCould be. But just going with it and letting it take me wherever I need to go\n\nCan relate wholeheartedly :) thanks for the post\n\nAre your triggers gone or do you respond to them differently now? Just curious.\n\nI respond to them differently and they do not seem as intense\n\nI love your positivity on things. May I ask why you chose to focus on meditation?\n\nThank you for posting this!\n\nThanks for sharing. How long is the time duration of your daily meditation practice ?\n\nI‚Äôm glad you found peace in your life! I should really start to meditate again because my life is now upside down!\n\nhow to start\n\nYour #2. Point is a strange one from a meditation perspective. The fact that you‚Äôre assigning emotions/vibes to people means you‚Äôre judging/labeling things in the moment. This is not true presents, for you are using memories to assess the situation.\n\nHonestly, this right here is what I look for when considering why i should be more consistent in my meditation practice. It's inspiring to see that you have received all of these benefits in just 8 months. Was maintaining consistency hard for you in the beginning of your meditation journey?\n\nI always look forward to meditating. Never felt like a burden. Now it‚Äôs something I do every morning. Like showering and brushing my teeth\n\nBeautiful üíñ\n\nI love this. Meditation had changed my life too! If you feel comfortable/would like; I'd love to chat further!\n\nWhat type of meditation üßò do you practice?\n\nGood reminder for me to start meditating!\n\nLOVE THIS\n\nThanks for reminding me why I need to start meditating again\n\nYour post is the sign i needed. Thank you üôèüèº\n\nThis is beautiful. Definitely agree that when I go through period of meditating I become more susceptible to energies &amp; picking up the emotion from other beings. It really gives you perspectives on how we are such energetic emotional beings.\n\nJust wanted you to clear one thing about meditation, let's say you have an intrusive thought while meditating amd have a reaction to it, do you \" sit\" in that feeling without having the chain of thoughts that comes after a trigger thought? \nAnd do you meditate when you are anxious or just in a specific time of the day?\n\nI always meditate at 6am. Weekends may be a little later. When a thought comes up. I let it ‚Äúfloat ‚Äú I see it, I acknowledge it‚Äôs there, and I give it no weight. If that is not working and I am getting lots of thoughts I start to visualize the actual words in the thought. I see the letters of the words sometimes in a smoke bubble and watch it dissipate.\n\nDo you do guided meditation ? And do you have a favorite yr channel for meditation?\n\nI do not do guided. Normally I use 1 giant mind app and also insight timer app.\n\nHow did anger go away? Would you mind elaborating on anger?\n\nIt is hard to put into words. But once I was able to recognize my emotions separate from my thoughts ,situations. It was easier to not let emotions take control. Yes anger , anxiety and all of the other emotions happen but it seems that I am able to get in front of it before it overtakes me and gets out of control. The longer you see that you can do this the easier it gets and the less it happens. Once you realize that emotions exist to protect your ego and your ego is not the real you, the less power the emotions holds over you because You see how pointless it is.\n\nMeditation can change your life in so many ways but If meditation isn't working for you then try consciously rewiring your brain during the day. This video explains how: [https://youtu.be/WH1b7Cg-Aw0](https://youtu.be/WH1b7Cg-Aw0)   I see more results this method.\n\n  \nThe reason why meditation works is it quiets the mind. It's crazy to think our overthinking is the reason our HIGHER SELF is hiding. Meditation quiets the mind to allow our higher intelligence to work to get us what we want.\n\nWhat kind of meditation / how long each day ?\n\nI too have had all these changes, except an additional one. As one goes along, he naturally is led to eating with less violent practices, living in a way that doesn't harm the planet, etc. and eventually one finds themselves so universally apart from its collegues (yes, duality) that they develop a bit of introversion due to how brutal society can treat these people, mistaking their wisdom and speech for weakness. They do not want to inflict harm nor be harmed so often are more alone to avoid constant debate. Seeing the dukkha they feel like they are in a dystopia..."

    "all_comment_text": "That‚Äôs a fantastic accomplishment! Not an easy thing to find that peace. I‚Äôm glad you feel it growing within, and you should beware the ego trap of judging other people for not being as awakened/present as you are.\n\nOr the trap that you've \"gotten\" anything. I remember having these thoughts and feeling like I somehow unlocked easy mode. Life finds its ways to challenge you in ways where sitting back and watching stuff unfold won't cut it üòâ\n\nLol so true. \n\nI will find peace, stay there for a few days, but life is so busy, people always need you to do things for them‚Ä¶\n\nI felt this too before. Would have this shit eating grin, just driving and just‚Ä¶ driving. Not do anything but driving. Felt like I was getting away with murder üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ\n\nYo that is literally me, I get this chessy ass grin on my face from being present and people think im laughing at them¬†\n\nI am happiest these days just aimlessly walking around the grocery store just vibing or driving around running errands. Being productive is a great feeling after years of inactivity and indecision and is one way I can access that zen flow state these days.\n\nWhere did that saying come from anyway? Shit eating grin.¬†\n\nIt really does!! I feel much much more grounded and relaxed.\n\nDont mind me, just taking a breath.\n\nDoes anyone ever find the experience of really clear and lucid present awareness to be a bit destabilizing? Sometimes I find the sensation of presence to be so salient, that it makes the default autopilot mode feel vastly far away. It feels like stepping out of the movie of life and going from a character in the scene to taking a seat in the audience. Sometimes I find it funny, like \"Look how silly all of this is.\" But other times it feels destabilizing, like \"Wtf is going on here? *Where* is here? *What* is here? Where/what is *there*?\" \n\nI guess the chronology is like: recognition of being in a different state, perceived distance between states, confusion about the nature of states, disorientation about the nature of reality and self.\n\nYeah, sometimes feel this too. It‚Äôs spiritual growing pains. A bit like dark night of the soul.\n\nYes, I have to try my best to \"restructure\" especially so after non dualistic meditation.\n\nI am scratching the surface of this experience on a daily basis and there are moments that feel like freedom. At this point in my practice of this daily there are more moments where I have a sense of fear, feeling other than and even worry that I may lose my ability to engage the world in an enthusiastic or charismatic way. \n\nI know those parts of me are social coping mechanisms all built for good reasons, but the positive feedback loop from this feeling of being liked is tightly linked to my identity and feeling part of the world.\n\nUnsure if I have a question here, just reflecting on your insight I guess. \n\nThe me that I have been is taking less of the spotlight so more of my Self can come thru. I guess I hope I can love that man as he experiences the world and the world experiences him too\n\nI had the same fear as you, and actually saw it manifest in real life. It seems to be a common thing as there were recent posts about it. Being blank, having nothing to say in a conversation, feeling like you kinda \"meditated all the thoughts out of your head\" and this leads to social isolation. \n\nWhat exactly does one do to get out of this? I'm not sure if this \"side effect\" is very common or rare as i've only seen some posts about it. But i haven't seen answers with practical solutions to it. \n\nCan i ask how you got over that fear or found a way to make it better? If it's the third para i couldn't't really understand it, or how to actually do it step by step. I'd highly appreciate any input, from anyone.\n\nI feel like I've thought about this enough that I could try giving you what I believe:¬†\n\n\nYou are more naturally calm, content, and peaceful; thus, any negative emotion felt breaks through in a heightened sense of awareness that you have become keen on improving.¬†\n\n\nBy focusing more on the root of those negative emotions you might develop a way of disconnect, similar to what is practiced in meditation. Any self-conscious thought might also be explained away as a simple counter thought of not needing to be seen or heard, as your importance placed on needing approval is further diminished.¬†\n\n\nThose negative thoughts are not what you want to identify with, so writing down these thoughts and understanding where they come from helps. It may be external or internal to your beliefs. It may be temporary or out of your control, so you might decide then to give it less importance in your subconscious.¬†\n\n\nI will admit, I don't know everything. This does feel like monk-speak in my response when I re-read my response. However, I hope this helps you and others.¬†\n\nThis is beautiful. And I can really identify with your words.\n\nThis is really beautiful i really really relate with you ü´∂\n\nActive mediation or living mediation. Welcome to the flow ü§©, literally you just moving ideal Midas touch type style. The world is yours when it starts happening for you not to you üí™\n\nLet's go! Flow based living for the win\n\nSo true!\n\nSooo true! Being present honestly feels like having a secret hack to life. While everyone‚Äôs out here spiraling over stuff they don‚Äôt even understand, just sitting back and¬†*being*¬†is next-level. It‚Äôs wild how much peace and confidence come from not getting sucked into the noise. Feels like an underrated superpower, for real.\n\n‚ÄúUnexamined life is not worth living.‚Äù\n\nIt feels like escapism to me, and not in a good way. I reached a point of feeling like I would need to go be a hermit if I wanted to continue, because everything that means something to me feels tied to aspects of myself that do not exist when I'm present. I've spent a lot of time battling nihilism as a result.\n\nIt's a mixed bag for me. Sometimes, being present opens me up to intense gratefulness and a feeling of peace, but it's generally fleeting now. Most of the time, there's a foreboding thought I contend with that basically keeps telling me there's a world of insanity happening around me that I have to return to, operate within, and cannot fully escape from.\n\nMy \"awakening\", if one can call it that, has become more tumultuous for me than anything. It simply feels inescapable for me to come to the conclusion that nothing matters, everything is subjective, brains are absurd, people are weird, \"I\" am just a brain talking about itself, etc.\n\nThe crash back to reality has gotten to the point of feeling worse than anything good a temporary meditative state of peace and presentness has lended. I don't really know how to pivot from this point, personally.\n\nDamn sorry to hear about your\nCircumstance\nNot sure if you are looking for advice, I wouldn't advise self harm if you were thinking that,¬†\ndiving deeper into your true nature may be the natural next step but you choose at the end of the day.¬†\n\nKeep going matey. It just means you‚Äôve not arrived at the path yet. It will be infinitely blissful and exciting and peaceful and wonderful. That‚Äôs how you know you need to keep looking. Keep exploring and testing and finding a way through this. You‚Äôre not looking for a destination but rather a path that is a joy to walk on forever. So that‚Äôs how you know there‚Äôs more, keep your faith. Currently you‚Äôre just stuck on a different path that is covered in thorns. It‚Äôs deceptive because it‚Äôs a path and it feels familiar but it‚Äôs not the ultimate one. Keep battling through and one day you‚Äôll come out into the beautiful clear delightful sunny light of the real path.\n\nHow do you obtain this, step by step? I am curious, please.\n\nPractice. Practice being present. Do this as much as you can, and it will eventually become almost second nature. \n\nMany people practice being present through meditation. Start off small. Then grow your practice.\n\nThank you!\n\nI'm extremely rigorous in practice, I often don't do sitting meditate long in a day maybe 20 minutes. But, throughout, I'm and constantly aware, and when realizing I've lost focus, refocusing on the body, breath, posture etc etc.¬†\n\nHow long did it take for mindfulness/present moment awareness to become natural to you? I've been practicing staying present as much as possible in day-to-day life for about a week now, but find it takes a lot of effort and doesen't feel very sustainable to constantly remind myself to stay present at all times.\n\nYou will improve with practice I often get exhausted from it as well, but it is intrinsically rewarded in that you do it for the sake for doing it, not doing the action for the fruit it will bring but the action itself. All I can say is, good work, your power is increasing and you're realizing your true nature more and more everyday.¬†\n\nCongratulations. You realized it. Many don't do this.\nBut be careful: The deeper you dive into this the more distant you will be from this world.\n\nIt is haha you can be your best self without interference\n\nMiss that feeling. Things have gotten rough lately.\n\nSorry to hear that mate!¬†\n\nYup! I'm having the same experience. It might be a little odd to say, but in my experience, it also feels like I have \"free access\" into flow state and time slowing down (to almost a painful level).\n\nYes, it is a bit crazy\n\nThat is awesome. But what I have read is that one can get more lasting benefits if they can empathize also at the same time with other. In other words this power without moral compass is short lived or infact counterproductive. But not sure how to achieve this as trying to create feeling if care and love if it does not arise naturally feels fake\n\nMine last lesson than a millisecond\n\nPractice awareness, posture, breathing, feeling, one pointed focus etc. Will improve, go slow but don't stop\n\nHey, that sounds great. \n\nI recently struggle with being present and in many cases end up day dreaming or in some constant thought process or stress (I found this is wrong and it is impacting my peace).\n\nCan you give tips or show me where to start? I would like to declutter my mind and achieve a bit more of sanity.\n\nKeep in mind that this state of mind ebbs n flows.\nI have written This post at a high point in my day.\nBut trust me, it is not always like that.\nI would just say you stay solid with your practice.\nTry to stay aware as much as you can.\nFocus on what you enjoy focusing on, breath, body, emotions, next step in your current situation etc.¬†\nBut if it's driving you crazy, then obviously relax a little bit.\nCome back when you feel ready.¬†\n\nI think you could have said this without arrogance.\n\nreal\n\nI said it with PRIDE! üò≠üòÑüòãüò´üò≠üòÑüòãüò´üò≠üòéüëÄü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°üëÅüëÅüëÅ\n\nThere is a reason I posted, keep it a secret would've been the selfish move.¬†\n\nReal\n\nI have been overtaken by my mind but i started to find joy watching my mind destroy myself\n\nCongratulations üôå\n\nGreat to hear. I started to feel this way then soon found in the words of Peter Crone, \"Life will present you with people and circumstances to show you where you are not free.\" I also found at some point a sense of the dark night of the soul. For most of us awakening is never complete, or has stages.\n\nI want to have a dark night but am scared at the same time, it shall come when it comes"

    "body": "I‚Äôll try and keep this short as nobody likes a wall of text. A few years back, at the height of the pandemic, I was doing well and had just lost a bunch of weight. I felt amazing. Suddenly, things started getting worse little by little. I‚Äôd get reflux which I‚Äôd never had before, my belly started getting bigger, and then eventually even walking down the road made me extremely anxious. For context, I live abroad, so I tend to stick out like a sore thumb. My health problems kept compounding and getting worse to where I genuinely thought I was dying at times. \n\nI‚Äôve had doctors do my lab work and run tests, convinced that something is wrong, and it‚Äôs all come back clean. There is still the slight possibility that something else is happening, but I‚Äôve decided that it all boils down to one thing: anxiety. Work stress, pandemic stress, health stress‚Ä¶ everything. I was making myself sick with stress in my daily life and only felt better when on vacation. I know that I can‚Äôt just quit my job and run from my problems, so I sought out meditation for my problems.\n\nThis past week I‚Äôve been meditating 20 minutes at a time, and I‚Äôve already noticed so much improvement. I‚Äôm not immediately drenched in sweat in public places, my reflux is slowly getting better, and my skin is less inflamed. I also feel less bloated overall. I know it will be a long process to heal from the chronic stress and anxiety, but I‚Äôm hopeful that meditating will continue to yield great benefits to my life.\n",

    "all_comment_text": "I‚Äôm quite new and dealing with anxiety also! Please tell me how u meditate personally. Is it just concentrating on the breath? Do u use an app? All the best\n\nI have used apps before, but lately I‚Äôve just been focusing on my breath while listening to nature sounds. I‚Äôm approaching it as if it‚Äôs something I NEED to do for my own health and happiness because I truly believe it is necessary for me. I have a hard time waking up early to meditate, and it‚Äôs hard to set aside time before bed to meditate, but my lunch break works well for it. I‚Äôve already noticed how much less tension I‚Äôm holding inside my body. Even little things like body aches or pains don‚Äôt stress me out like they used to. If I notice that I‚Äôm feeling any sort of discomfort or anxiety in my body, I try and take a moment to acknowledge it but not let it get me stressed. \n\nTry not to get too caught up in ‚Äúdoing meditation right‚Äù like I have. It‚Äôll only stress you out. Just start out small and watch your breathing.\n\nWow this is amazing. Reading your symptoms etc sounds exactly like me. I love that needing to do it for health, just in the same way I would treat exercise. Thank you for this and all the best - sounds like your doing amazing\n\nYeah, I had so many days where I‚Äôd worry myself sick thinking I must have cancer or something serious‚Ä¶ even after doctors checked me out and said I was fine. You can do it! It isn‚Äôt always fun or easy, but I think it can help you too.\n\nThat has been me, everyday it‚Äôs some form of cancer or an impending stroke or heart attack - it‚Äôs debilitating. I‚Äôm going to meditate today and try and relax.\n\nIt‚Äôs hard to maintain, but keep at it. You deserve to feel less anxious and panicky.\n\nOhh! You have \"spots of tension\"? Like put your tongue against teeth, or raise the shoulders? \nYour anxiety have a \"elaborated narrative\" or persistent worry attached to something?\n\nMy entire body was just sore and inflamed to be honest. Upset stomachs all the time, headaches, tight shoulders‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd always been pretty healthy before that. I noticed how much better I felt when I‚Äôm vacation and realized that the anxiety I feel each day had to be responsible for most of my problems. I honestly didn‚Äôt realize how bad it was until I visited family back home and noticed how much better I felt within just a day or two.\n\nYoga nidra has been a lifesaver for me https://www.youtube.com/@SarovaraYoga/videos\n\nI do the yoga Nidra meditation while laying on an acupressure mat in a dimly lit room. It‚Äôs like a relaxation multiplier. I use the down dog yoga app which has a yoga Nidra module. I usually go about 30 minutes and I feel amazing afterwards.\n\nWhat also helps me is reminding myself that this feeling is impermanent. Like, when it's really overwhelming anxiety or stress, somehow remembering that this feeling is not permanent gives me a sense of safety and peace\n\nI use the balance app and absolutely love it. Ofosu, one of the main voices\non the app, has become my life guide of sorts. \n\nAnother non-conventional tip is to download the chatgpt app and unload your feelings in the app. It responds with helpful tips and reassurance. It‚Äôs amazing honestly.\n\nTry smiling mind. It's good one and free too\n\nI have experienced tremendous benefits of meditation and this journey will be beautiful for you as well, also remember There is nothing like perfect meditation, each session is Good..  otherwise with too much expectation - you will only get more anxious, meditation is all about being present, observing and accepting whatever is there now (good/bad) without even judging.. Expectation only makes people more anxious.. May you continue to get more stronger :))\n\nThank you! I know it‚Äôs a slow process, both with becoming ‚Äúbetter‚Äù at meditating and recovering from years of nearly constant stress and anxiety, but even just the bit of improvement I‚Äôve already seen makes it so worth it.\n\nAlso you can try Headspace , Calm, Plum village App, they have guided meditation on youtube also,   \nTry Yoga nidra meditation also, I love it for complete body relaxation.   \nAlso Try to 1-2 good books, that will cover more broader aspect of meditation or overall spirituality, for you to gain more out of meditation.\n\nI myself have all but conquered anxiety through meditation, but also reading researching the Dao and its philosophy; meditation being a huge part of that. \n\nI used to not be able to fly, or sit in a crowded movie theater, you name it. Couldn‚Äôt breathe, clammy sweat, nausea, I even full on fainted a few times. Through meditating and mantras learned from Daoism and Stoicism, I‚Äôm extremely proud to say I have no more symptoms, ever! It‚Äôs powerful and I‚Äôm very happy for you, OP! Keep up the great work!\n\nThat‚Äôs amazing! I hope to get there someday! I‚Äôve always been into Buddhism and the spiritual aspects of it, finding that a better fit for me than other religions or philosophies. I like how introspective and self-guided it is, just trying to better yourself for the sake of being a better version of yourself, not to reap some reward or whatever. I just want to be content with who I am and be the best me I can.\n\n[removed]\n\nWell that could be a very long answer! But to keep it brief, and in my own words of course; it's a book about life, and how to simply, be. It reads beautifully as it's essentially poems and verses that are easy to digest. There are numerous translations and some say the Dao De Jing (The Book of the Way), is essentially the bible for Daoism. It teaches us how to be at peace, get in tune with nature, accept and be grateful for all outcomes, understanding you can not have the good without the bad, light without dark; yin &amp; yang, balance. I could go on!\n\nIf you are interested, here is a brief 6 min video that summarizes it pretty well. If you like it, I highly recommend the creators channel, George Thompson. \n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kij4kKSGzCE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kij4kKSGzCE)\n\n[removed]\n\nIt is not, just one of those things with translators over the centuries. Tao and Dao are the same thing.\n\nWould you mind sharing how long this took you, and what your practice entails? Appreciate it will be wildly different for each individual :)\n\nTL;DR  \nI started about 5 years ago. I practice Daoism &amp; Stoicism, meditate, exercise, fast, and changed my diet...\n\nWell yes, you said it, we are all so different with different types of anxiety, different triggers, different diets; you name it. Yes, I do feel changing my diet had a large part to play in my practice and experience. My first steps was trying to identify and understand my type of anxiety and my triggers. For me, it was control. Why I was a \"nervous flyer\", or always wanted to be the one driving my car with friends to the event, so if something happens, I know I have my car and can control the situation.\n\nNext was really important... I wanted to change. It was not some unsolicited advice from a friend or loved one, not some video link someone sent me, although later that was all important and greatly appreciated; in fact, it was the suggestion from a single individual that started me on this journey. But the fact that I wanted to change was the first major step in changing my thought process. Think someone that decides to go to AA, versus a court ordering them to go to AA; who is going to get more from that experience. You have to want it, you have to try it, and you have to stick with it and keep at it, even when it feels silly and weird at first, keep it up! There are tons of books, but I think a very popular one by Wayne Dyer, \"Change your thoughts, change your life\". I know Oprah has one that's similar, but bottom line, your thought processes are vitally important to us all, and nothing I've achieved would have been possible in my old mindset.\n\nThen I just started researching and through the power of reddit and youtube, one can literally learn anything till their hearts desire. I was sent a video from a close friend that knew I was starting out this journey and then YT started suggesting more, and more. This eventually led me to finding the Dao. The Dao led me to meditating and mantras, teaching me to accept fate and be grateful for whatever the outcome is, no matter the situation. This is a case of easier said than done, and it by all means did not happen overnight. But that first flight I had where I didn't feel I was about to throw up or faint; made it all worth it. As well as the Dao, Stoicism also helped me along my journey. They have many similarities but also many differences. Stoicism taught me how to relax and go with the flow, essentially become unoffendable.\n\nChanging my diet a great deal as well from the SAD diet (standard american diet) to a much more organic and whole food diet. Just cut out highly processed food with preservatives and refined sugars at least, and strive for all fresh organic whole foods. This plus exercising, meditating, and researching personal and spiritual growth has all helped me get to where I am at today. I also started intermittent fasting and have done many extended fasts. And this is a journey that will never end, I will be on this path for the rest of my life and always learning and growing.\n\nTo answer your question, I only started on this path about 4-5 years ago. A tiny blip compared to some others that may have a more relatable experience for you. As you said, we are all so very different, this has been my experience over the last 5 years, and a glimpse into my practices. Here are some youtube channels I highly recommend:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/@George-Thompson](https://www.youtube.com/@George-Thompson)  \n[https://www.youtube.com/@Einzelganger](https://www.youtube.com/@Einzelganger)\n\nIf anyone else would like to share their own experiences, I'd love to read all about them. I wish you all the very best on your own journeys!\n\nThank you! Wishing you all the best xx\n\n(Sorry, English is not my first language)\nPlease, talk about How is when you're doing It and what are your methods. I think 20m is absolutly impressive, If are they 20m of concentration. I praticte when im laid read to sleep and use the Focus on parts of my body \"breathing on they\" to shut down the manancial of thougts. Is that wicth you think in your toes, and them feet, and ankles... And goes climbing the body. This method helps me because im very aprendice and my mind doesn't stop create scenarios like I'm living in others dimensions simultaneously. Meanwhile I'm working, i try describe what I'm doing at that moment to keep myself in the moment. \nPlease comment your tecnic and what happens with your mind when you're trying. My theory is the way our mind behave is the key to achieve a good method to deal with the sintoms.\n I don't have anxiety anymore, but I remember a painfully process of getting out the cycle of being worried about some issues and creating mind habits to stop the bad flux going. In my case, I evolved the capacity to stop the flux, mark the principal limes of thinking and ask myself what to do in worst scenario I could imagine. Worked for me and believe the skill to can \"pause\" your flux of thoughs and analyse they as you are other more racional person was a skill evolved by meditation.\n\nYour English is really good in my opinion. :) I tend to drift a lot since I‚Äôm still training my mind, but I try to calmly notice this and bring my attention back to noticing my breathing. It‚Äôs already helped me in my daily life to stay present and not let my anxiety take over. Before this, my anxiety would start up and I would let it get me stressed out. I still get anxious at times, but I am able to notice it now and keep it under control.\n\nIt takes years to me can analise my thoughts. Try this exercise: talk with yourself like you trying help a person, calling yourself by the name. Memorize phrases that resumes who you are, what are doing with your life and what you have. Like mantras to root you back to a safe reality. I know looks stupid, but the feeling I remember have was like being possessed by other person, and them I stayed completely incapable of let out that agony, so I started to let myself little \"amulets\" in the house, in the notes agenda, or writed in my pulses to remember me that I'm ok.\n\nmeditation is really amazing, paired with social media detox it works wonder¬†\n\nIt really does\n\nHave you ever consulted a therapist for anxiety? Much of my anxiety arises from being a sensitive person (empath). A therapist specializing in Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy can offer valuable insights to improve understanding. Empaths, in particular, are more prone to anxiety. This year, I visited a cardiologist, suspecting heart problems. However, after an echocardiogram and a two-week heart monitoring, no abnormalities were found. I was riddled with anxiety this year because I‚Äôm aging and concerned for my health. Unfortunately, anxiety can manifest both physically and mentally, including intrusive thoughts. I'm glad to hear that meditation has provided you some relief.\n\nI‚Äôve seen a number of therapists over the years. It helps when you‚Äôre actively seeing them, but then afterwards it seems like I forget the advice or get into the same patterns again. I‚Äôd consider myself an HSP, so I often get overwhelmed and overstimulated. I have to try and limit the stimuli or else I very easily get overwhelmed.\n\nI've been dealing with a work related issue for past 8 years. Last 2 years I've had left abdominal pain which family doctor and GE found to be nothing. Stress does a number on many things. Started meditating few months back. When I got the bad news that can't work for 2 months, NOTHING HAPPENED. I was very slightly affected but it was far from the response I would've had if I were not meditating regularly. Lifesaver. Still a beginner but PM me. I hope there is a close group on whatsapp of likeminded individuals.\n\nEDIT: Using antidepressants for 17 years.\n\nIt‚Äôs definitely a slow process. I still have various things that pop up like the reflux and various aches and pains, but I think I‚Äôm better at keeping it in perspective now. Maybe it won‚Äôt 100% go away, but I already feel quite a bit better. I know it took me a few years to get to this place, so I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll take a while to get back out of it now.\n\nI loved reading this and I‚Äôm so happy for you!!!!\n\nAnxiety is a perception. It‚Äò created by your mind. The mind‚Äòs task is to solve problems. It‚Äòs looking for them all the time. It‚Äòs great, when needed, but a problem, when it cannot stop. So, you need to let go.\n\nSit down, straight spine if possible, focus on your breath. Meaning, observe it constantly, don‚Äòt control it intentionally.\n\nDoing that you‚Äòll realize thoughts. You‚Äòre having a ‚Äûdialogue‚Äú, your thinking about ‚Äûtasks you‚Äòre about to do‚Äú and so on. This is your mind looking for a new problem to solve. Observe these thoughts shortly. Don‚Äôt get involved. Let them pass. Go back to the observation of your breath. Do this all over. Again and again. Don‚Äòt push. This can‚Äòt be forced.\n\nBy doing so you learn 1. what your thinking 2. you are not your thoughts, cause you can observe them 3. to let them go. \n\nMeditation is about not doing.\n\nImportant: No matter how important your thoughts seem to be, let go. They‚Äòll come back. When you‚Äòre starting to get restless and thinking things like you cannot afford doing ‚Äûnothing‚Äú for such a long time, remind yourself shortly: \n\n‚ÄûBreathing is enough‚Äú\n\nThere is no need for anything more in this life to experience it‚Äòs full beauty than breathing. It‚Äòs our constant connection to life, to us, as our current expression of it.\n\nTry to meditate for a longer time. Your body needs to come into a state of ‚Äûfull rest‚Äú, before your mind can relax, because they‚Äòre connected. Alone that takes a few good minutes.\n\nBe easy. Joy and playfulness are life‚Äôs natural states.\nBy meditating you‚Äòre perception of life will find it‚Äòs way back. Your body will follow.\n\nI wish you good health and a beautiful life.\n\nThis was such a helpful post, thank you\n\nHappy to help.\n\nAre you me?\n\nIt really helps me so much with anxiety and overthinking!! Had such an impact on my health and sobriety :)\n\nI used to meditate 20 min twice a day it was amazing. Now I can‚Äôt sit more than 2 min and can‚Äôt meditate that‚Äôs annoying\n\nDoing whatever you can should help. I hope you get back to a place of being able to meditate. :)\n\nDo you know why most psychiatrist don‚Äôt  \"prescribe \" meditation? Because it is free and they will not make money from it and it does only have positive effects so they cannot prescribe you even more medication to counter side effects of meds.\n\nI do have depression and life is hard but I am refusing to take medication because I had Tinnitus from last medication so I am probably sensitive to medication and I dont want to gamble with next medication so I rather meditate.\n\nI do meditate + play memory game because when I have good memory it is making me happy somehow :D \n\nMeditation is great for Anxiety because if you can control your breath, you can control your emotions and give some oxygen to your brain when you are anxious. \n\nLot of time in anxiety we forgot to breath and we are holding our breaths which is making anxiety 10x worse.\n\nI bounced back a lot of panic attacks thanks to meditation and now I have no panic attacks. In the past I end up in hospital because of my panic attacks since those was causing me very high blood pressure and I needed to be hospitalized.\n\nMeditation will not solve all the problems but it is great gun in your arsenal. Try it also pair with some brain activity like running, chess etc.. It is great extension to train to be in present moment.\n\nIn the same boat as you. Sudden reflux issues compounded with extreme stress a few months back gave me extreme health anxiety. My doctor was worried about my blood pressure because every time I was in office it was high (and I'm only 22). Ultimately it seems like it's all just stress. When I'm calm my BP is normal. But every little pain in my body convinces my brain I'm gonna die. \n\nI've thankfully been much better lately but only recently started meditating as a recommendation from my therapist and doctor. It's been fantastic. I look forward to going deeper and improving over the next long while\n\nKeep it up! I think it may take me a while to get over my issues since they‚Äôve been going on for a few years at this point, but I hope to get there someday.\n\nOMG I have been having anxiety issues and a ton of reflux problems. My whole life I‚Äôve been facing sexual/pelvic floor issues idk if it‚Äôs mental or physical but these problems have drove me to the edge.\n\nI struggle with sexual performance anxiety and actually I think I almost fixed myself when I had a nice streak of 20 minute meditations going.\n\nDo you meditate sitting or standing?\n\nI prefer sitting. It‚Äôs more comfortable for me. That‚Äôs interesting about the pelvic floor stuff. I‚Äôve never been diagnosed, but I‚Äôve come across it in those frantic googling sessions where your anxiety just takes over and you feel off. I get weird lower back/pelvic pain and sensations. Always assumed it was just GERD but it‚Äôs hard to say. Sometimes it just feels numb?\n\nOh god I feel like my private areas are numb all the time!! I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs severe anxiety or what. I need help bro\n\nLook into OCD\n\nI completely relate and my anxiety journey has been very similar. Glad to hear the progress!\n\nthanks for your post. i was doing meditation every morning and evening since year start. but i was thrown off my track this week - just a series of awful events that happened close to one another and it‚Äôs just been awful.\n\ni‚Äôm excited to start again tomorrow, every new day brings a new opportunity to be better ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π\n\nHave you considered doing an endoscopy to check for gastritis?\n\nGastritis causes these symptoms, meditation helps a lot but at some point it's doesn't anymore because the inflammation of the stomach will keep causing these issues until resolved. I hope it's not your cause but it's mine. Just thought I'll let you know so you don't go crazy when eventually you hit a wall and no doctor believes you...IF this happens to you and I truhope it won't and I just stress that will go away with meditation.\n\nI did an endoscopy a couple years ago when my reflux first developed. They said my LES was a bit loose but nothing major showed up, and there was minimal damage. My symptoms basically go away when I‚Äôm away from my daily life and on vacation, so I‚Äôm led to believe that it has to do with my anxiety levels.\n\nYes if they do, then it's probably the stress affecting it. Mine doesn't go away EVER and it causes stress, the mind gut connection goes both ways.\n\nI hope you'll feel better soon ‚ù§\n\nI started meditation 2 months ago. While I am unable to meditate daily, I have started doing it regularly for the past week. I don't know if I'm doing it right. When I wake up, I wash my eyes and sit in bed, lean on the wall and just close my eyes. I have been doing it for 20 mins.\n\nGood post!\n\nLook into breath work, too :)\n\nI'm struggling with my patience now so i can't really meditate , any tips?\n\nTry to be gentle with yourself. I‚Äôm also not patient at all, but I‚Äôm trying to be calm and gentle with myself whenever I start to drift off or lose my focus. I don‚Äôt need to stress out about it, so I try and slow down and bring my focus back to my breathing.\n\nWhat kind of meditation do you do ?\n\nI honestly just focus on my breath and bring myself back to that whenever I start to drift off. I‚Äôm still not great at it, but it‚Äôs really helping.\n\nHave you noticed a change in your weight since you started meditating? I‚Äôve put on belly fat from stress and it‚Äôs making me more sad :(\n\nNot yet, but it‚Äôs still early. I think my cortisol may have been jacked up for a while now, so it may take some time to go down.\n\nI‚Äôm similar please explain what type of meditation are you doing?\n\nJust focusing on my breath with some nature sounds in the background. Mindfulness\n\n[removed]\n\nJust keep with it! I‚Äôm not perfect, and I still have my anxiety, but I‚Äôm definitely aware of it now and able to sort of stop myself from spiraling. I‚Äôm also more aware now of what I‚Äôm putting into my body that may be negatively affecting me. For example, I can‚Äôt do a ton of coffee like I used to. One americano a day is enough, otherwise I‚Äôll be stressed all day.\n\nThis is practically my life story. So happy you figured it out. I solved mine the same way as you after very little help from doctors. Good to see so many people meditating to solve their anxiety these days. Keep going!\n\nGood luck"

    "title": "Serious meditators: please protect your knees",
    "body": "I just wanted to post this PSA. I am a life-long meditator and former monk. One thing that is rarely talked about but actually a huge health issue for serious western meditators  is knee damage from sitting too long in lotus variations. If your hips aren't open enough you will gradually inflame and do permanent damage to the ligaments in your knees. You can also get a syndrome called \"meditators leg\" which can leave you with a permanent limp.\n\n  \nSome ways you can protect yourself: \n\n1. Do not ignore knee pain when meditating.\n\n 2. Seriously open your hips. Yoga poses like butterfly, pigeon and fire logs can help with this. As westerners who don't grow up accustomed to sitting on the floor, our hips may never be as flexible as people who grew up in different cultures in the east. I'm a very flexible guy and performed several of these techniques for a long time over years which has helped, but I have still damaged my knees from sitting too long too many years in lotus variations. I think for most people yoga poses like these are not a sufficient solution if you are meditating for hours every day. \n\n3. Chairs are okay. Most chairs do not have good ergonomics for meditating (keeping the back straight without leaning and allowing a full deep breath). If you choose to mediate in a chair consider shopping carefully to find one that lets your torso have correct balance and posture. \n\n  \n4. Consider a seiza (meditation bench). I've recently switched to one of these even though they are not common in my tradition and have found it extremely helpful. It allows you to sit as upright and be almost as stable as lotus with no stress on your knees. It also keeps you close to the floor so you don't feel out of place when meditating with others who are on the ground. \n\n  \nHappy meditating to you all. Just wanted to share an insight I learned the hard way that could have helped me a lot if someone had told me when I started. ",

    "all_comment_text": "I just want to thank you for this PSA. I‚Äôve had teachers shame me and tell me that pain is all a figment of my mind, and a benefit to my practice, when I adjust my posture due to knee or back pain. I think it‚Äôs so important to listen to your body.\n\nYes, the first several years of meditation I was also told to just ignore the pain and that it was just coming from my mind. Thank you for listening to your body!\n\nIt‚Äôs important to know the difference between discomfort and pain. One you can work through and the other is a warning to take seriously. That is something I learned in yoga.\n\nI did a half-day zen retreat that was half wall meditation, half walking.\nNot a good plan for me, the arthritic!\n\nI legit have bruises on my knees lol glad this was brought up\n\nI don‚Äôt pay too much attention to it besides in the morning where they sound like rice krispies. Gonna take better care of myself\n\nThank you for taking care of yourself! Your body will thank you!\n\nif you are meditating you should be aware of it\n\nI meditate laying down.. Can fall asleep though. Sometimes I do it sitting in a chair. I‚Äôve been thinking about trying that technique where you sit meditating with your hands over a bowl of water so if you fall asleep it wakes you.\n\nI too meditate (part of the time) lying down and used to have problems with nodding off (which happened occasionally sitting upright as well). Then I started reading [The Mind Illuminated](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16pKrr74_4bnYc6GqQeScou9riGhxtst4/view) (free pdf download) and learned about dullness.\n\nIt turns out that when we are too focused on a meditation object (breath, mantra, whatever) we can limit sensory information going to the brain, causing it to become dull and detached, which leads to falling asleep.\n\nYou might find it useful to download the book and search it for ‚Äúdullness‚Äù and ‚Äúperipheral awareness‚Äù. These terms come up over and over throughout, but discussions on these topics in the first three or four chapters will give you some techniques that will combat this problem. It takes a little practice though, so don‚Äôt be discouraged if it doesn‚Äôt help right away.\n\nThere‚Äôs also a sub: r/TheMindIlluminated. If you search the sub for ‚Äúdullness‚Äù and/or ‚Äúperipheral awareness‚Äù you‚Äôll find that dullness is a common problem that can be overcome.\n\nNamaste.\n\nWow! Thank you!!! üôè Il 100 check that outttt\n\nI was taught to hold your upper arm up at a 90 degree angle when meditating laying down on your back. This will keep you from falling asleep as the sudden movement when dropping your arm will wake you up.\n\nHaha that would be good if I didn‚Äôt sleep with one hand in the air!!! Hahaha\n\nSupposedly Tesla did this if I remember correctly..\n\nnever understood why lotus or difficult position is needed in the first place\n\nThey aren‚Äôt.\n\nIt has to do with the 7 point alignment. You are able to become still in good posture for longer periods.  However, being from the west your body develops differently and at the point we start practicing it makes it extremely challenging to achieve that alignment. Not impossible, just pretty challenging.\n\nyou‚Äôre referring to the chakras?  how is laying  down any different\n\nNo. Chakras is different. Look up 7 point meditation posture.\n\nI've got a comfy chair that I meditate with. Don't let yourself get caught up in the \"right\" way, there's no reason to hurt yourself to meditate, you've got all the time in the world, why not allow yourself some convenience.\n\nI injured my knee in lotus last week. Now I cannot fully straighten my left leg. Thankfully my doctor was able to rule out a ligament tear and we believe it is just a strained quadricep which should get better over time. I know I will be much more careful in the future!\n\nThank you for taking care of yourself!\n\nBhante Vimalaramsi used to say something like:\n\nYou can get just as enlightened sitting on a chair!\n\nDoesn't kneeling also put pressure on the knees?\n\n  \nWhat is the relationship between 'open hips' and being able to sit in lotus? What do open hips actually mean and how do I tell if mine are open enough?\n\nWhen your hip joints are not flexible enough the stretch from lotus variations gets displaced into an improper lateral movement of your knee (i.e., your knee moves left-right instead of forward-back in order to bring your foot far enough up and inward). That is extremely bad for your knee long term. If your hips are very very flexible there will be no improper stress on your knee but for most people that is not realistic.\n\nYes. Seiza can be far more stressful to knees and ankles than simply sitting in a chair or in simple seated yoga postures. No need to sit directly on the floor. The hips should be higher than the knees as would be on a proper Zafu cushion.\n\nThere are countless YouTube tutorials on how to do hip opener exercises to reduce the stress on your knees when sitting for meditation. Some are very helpful in general for overall well being\n\nConsider if you are sitting in a lotus position, your hips should be above your knees. I used a meditation floor chair during a 4-day retreat and even though my hips are open it seemed to pull on my calves and I had to deal with leg pain during the second half of my retreat. I got a regular meditation cushion that I use with the floor chair so my hips are elevated and I can still utilize the back rest and I don‚Äôt experience pain now.\n\nGreat! I'm happy you found a way to sit without pain!\n\nSeiza is the way to go! I couldn't practice for longer periods until I got the bench. Life changing! But thank you for this post. I do know a lot of people with knee problems from meditating. Something that gets progressively worse as we age if we don't correct it.\n\nThe importance of this advice cannot be stressed enough. Particularly young men tend to ignore this, believing they have to be \"tough\" or whatever.\n\nExactly.\n\nWhat should I do if one of my legs fall asleep?\n\nwhat position are you sitting? and how long at a time?\n\nI usually sit on a chair with my back upright. I don‚Äôt do half lotus bc my right leg tends to fall asleep after about 15-20 mins. I feel like I can ‚Äòbe‚Äô more in the moment when I‚Äôm cross legged which is why I‚Äôm asking. Thank you.\n\nThats just a thought and as long as you hold that thought as true it will be so because our beliefs are very powerful.\n\nI can't give any concrete advice because I think this is partially about how you feel personally about different positions, but I would just say try experimenting with different chairs and different cushions / heights / positions if you want to be on the ground. Also as noted above consider trying a meditation bench as they can be a nice middle path between a chair and the floor. Thank you for taking care of yourself and thinking about it!\n\nEven my legs fall asleep, but i tend to sit longer so the feeling gradually disappears and blood flows through the knee properly again. I tend to do meditation with mantras\n, because mantra let's me tap into the frequency easily.\n\nI kneel also on a bench thing but lay a folded fleece blanket down on the floor so my knees don't hurt.\n\nGreat! Thank you for listening to your body!\n\nThanks for this! Didn‚Äôt know it was an issue\n\nsincere question: why lotus pose for meditation vs something like siddhasana or sukhasana for longer sitting? I understand lotus pose for specific energy channeling, but for meditation, why do it?\n\nBoth are fine and stable, if by sukhasana/siddhasana you do not mean tailor's seat which is an unstable position. I usually teach sukhasana/burmese position when introducing new meditators. Yes, in a perfect world, one would sit in a full lotus but this is generally not attainable in a safe way by most westerners without rigorous flexibility practice over a few years.\n\nLotus position is for aligning your nadis, or pathways and mainly your chakras will be aligned correctly.\n\nVery interesting information. I could never stay on my knees for any amount of time. And to do it now causes unbearable pain if I get on the floor for something. And with my hip issues, sitting in lotus position or indian-style could never be done by me. So when I meditate, I do use a stool.\n\nThank you for listening to your body!\n\nHello sir, i may advice you to ask somebody to be your guru. Not a physical guru, if you ask sincerely your prayer will be answered.¬† I was too not able to sit¬† without spiritual practice.¬†\n\nI really recommend this video [Yoga for Meditators](https://youtu.be/WeaFQxg-Vr0), with Bhante Rahula. Among other things, it has a very nice exercise for opening up the hips. There are several similar videos by him if you do a search on YouTube.\n\nAnother thing is if we're meditating several hours every day, put standing and walking meditation into the mix.\n\nListen to this advice, guys. I permanently damaged my ligaments trying to sit in a lotus.\n\nThank you for sharing! Sorry you've had to deal with that!\n\nThank you! \n\nMom is from Asia. She always complained about me wanting to sit on a cushion; and all she has is a small rug.\n\nLike yes, mom I‚Äôd like to do this. BUT I‚Äôm not gonna sacrifice my knees, specially, when I started working out, now.\n\nI‚Äôll look for a seiza bench or a chair.\n\nI mean I also know I can do sleeping or walking meditation. \n\nBut sometimes I just look at my mother and ask: ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you use something other than a furry rug?‚Äù I mean she does the ‚Äúasian squat‚Äù where as I can‚Äôt, so she‚Äôs probably used to it.\n\nYes! I‚Äôve been using a bench instead of lotus and my sessions have been so much better since. Invest in a bench folks!\n\nGood for you!\n\nThank you :)\n\nI can afford to buy a chair so that is how I meditate . Those that can't afford one should make their own. Don't meditate the dumb way.\n\nWhat style chair do you use?\n\nComfortable preferably with a straight back.\n\nWould you mind sharing where you were a monk at?\n\nAnd why did you stop/quit?\n\nI‚Äôm thinking about becoming a monk and so i was curious. Thanks for any insights!\n\nI'm glad you are thinking about it and asking for people's experiences. It can be an incredible life. \n\nI lived in a Hindu ashram in the US which was part of a family of ashrams mostly in India. I'm not going to give more specific info about them both for my privacy and bc I don't want to publicize them, but I'm happy to share why I left. \n\nMy religious community, like many, had a tendency to worship its spiritual leader. This can be especially troublesome in Hindu-based traditions (but not uniquely) which have theology to reinforce that behavior, promoting people implicitly or explicitly to believe their guru is fully enlightened, morally perfected and infallible or even a divine avatar who deserves absolute obedience and devotion. All of the latter was the case in my tradition to quite an extreme. When you are wrapped up in that ideology it can create feelings of ecstasy and intense love just being around the guru. On one hand that is a very compelling experience that can propel you deeper into your spiritual practice. On the other hand (and I think much more importantly) it's very dangerous because leaders are also human and therefore prone to all the same desires as other people--for example, sex, money, power, adoration, drug-use and violence, among others.\n\nHaving unquestioned authority and therefore high/unlimited access to these human inclinations (even in a tradition that ostensibly teaches humility, non-violence and abstinence) is enough to take just about anyone off the rales. In a surprising amount of religious organizations there are serious ethical issues among the leadership in the way they go about dealing with those temptations / natural inclinations especially compared to the way they present themselves to the public. For a cautionary tale, you can read about the issues that came out about Osho's ashram in Oregon (Rajneeshpuram) and his life in general.\n\nIn my particular case, the ethical issues among leadership were not nearly as drastic as in his; however, they were enough for me to eventually escape seeing my guru as an infallible divine being and take a more sincere critical look at all the doctrine I was taught there. I realized I had to decide for myself what I believed was true about the world and figure out for myself who I was rather than have all of that handed to me by a divine guru. This is just one facet of one person's experience and I was not a monk for very long. But these are sadly reasonably prevalent dangers you should be aware of especially if you still have the opportunity to \"shop\" a bit between different organizations. I also want to add, there were some fantastic people at my ashram as well who are still there and are getting a lot out of being there. It had positive qualities too. If you have more questions feel free to DM.\n\nThank you for this.  I was practicing with the Bhagwan before he became Osho.  I could see the creep happening, saved me much time, and I still do meditation.  Apparently meant to be a solo practitioner on silent retreats, and that‚Äôs okay.\n\nWallaby, You might appreciate my experience with zen teachers -- http://www.frogzen.com/uncategorized/teachers/\n\nAs for knees -- I started serious zazen at zen centers in the 1960's and I've done countless sesshin (retreats) with teachers over the decades, sitting in the half lotus for 10 hours a day or more, switching which leg is on top and sometime assuming the full lotus. I've also sat several hours a day for most of my life. I'm in my eighties now and my knees are in good shape for my age (I can still run and do squats and sit in the half lotus comfortably for 40 minutes at a time).\n\nI've injured my meniscus several times working in the woods and on construction projects, but in my experience, sitting in the half or full lotus is actually good for the knees and hips, providing one gets into it gradually. The pain in the knees from long sitting in sesshin goes away after a day or two and it becomes wonderfully comfortable. Some zen centers (like Mount Baldy) can be quite macho and most of us sit more than is comfortable. But I've never seen anyone actually injure themselves that way. I used to wonder if sitting in the lotus repeatedly loosens the knees and makes them more vulnerable to injury, but for me that hasn't been the case. I know a lot of folks my age who have had knee and hip replacements, but none of them were meditators. \n\nIn zen the meditation periods are 25-40 minutes with 5-10 minutes walking meditation between sittings. Such sit-walk-sitting can be continued almost indefinitely. Those intermittent periods of walking are good for the entire body/mind -- and probably help the knees as well.\n\nSolid advice\n\nThank you!\n\nI find that a chair does the job just as good until your back starts getting tense in case you meditating for a few hours of course.\n\namazing. I have no such problem, fortunatelly, but I'll keep it in mind when teaching, you're quite right\n\nThank you for considering! Glad you haven't had any problems!\n\nNice reminder ‚ô•Ô∏è\n\nCrazy because my knees go out randomly the same day I mediate for a while.\n\nI doubt the posture is that important anyways. Its more about the actual meditation practise.\n\nI think the burmese position (leg in front of the other one) is the most forgiving and stable position for westerners, if one isn't comfortable with any lotus variation. The knee doesn't bend in any unnatural ways at all with that position. I still sit in burmese for 90% of the time. But, important note: people need to both strength train and do mobility work, e.g., yoga, more. This is the primary reason why people hurt throughout the day.\n\nAgree, but don‚Äôt forget to stretch.\n\nI meditate on my couch :)  \nWhat i observed is after a few moment, can't say how much maybe 20-30minutes i guess, i just autocorrect my body without really thinking about it, it's almost like these subtle movements are part of the meditation itself, the combo \"observation + sensation\" of these subtle movements is mind blowing to me.  \nI already have knees issues, so i'm not the one that is gonna practice seiza or even \"floor\" practice.  \nThis way i can meditate for 2 to 3 hours sometimes.  \nMeditation is available for everyone, for every bodies and souls  :)  \nThank you for sharing this, very grateful &lt;3\n\nOur Guru recommends Ardha Siddhasana(mostly for people living in family). Which is a much simpler posture to sit for longer hours.\n\nMy solution is here. I found a very nicely elevated cushion. About double in size of a regular one. Plus the bench. [Bench and XL Cushion](https://imgur.com/a/4QqalSz)\n\nOr lay down. It's just as effective. It really is.¬†\n\nFor many (including me!) laying in meditation tends to induce drowsiness and dullness. Sitting upright tends to counteract this.\n\nThat has been my experience as well.\n\nit's not the same in effect,  as there is no muscular activation caused by sitting upright.  It's still good,  but definitely not the same.\n\nI disagree.¬†\n\nso much about traditional meditation is bullshit. Thank you for exposing one of the misunderstandings. The goal of sitting is not to twist your legs into an uncomfortable position. The goal is to sit still for long periods without needing or wanting to move, fidgeting, squirming, etc.\n\nI‚Äôve never had a teacher demand lotus or similar postures and have let that go for myself. I‚Äôve meditated daily for more than a decade, but only because I don‚Äôt do it ‚Äúright.‚Äù The routine, for me, is what is important‚Äîget it done by hook or by crook.\n\nIt might sound strange but always do some stretching before you sit to meditate.  It sounds strange but it makes a bigger difference than you might think.\n\nWhen I went to a meditation retreat, they had us do stretches related to yoga.  It helped a lot plus the more you do it, the more flexibility you will gain without meaning to.\n\nYou don't need a bench to sit seiza style. There are good videos that detail how to start sitting in that posture. I personally tilt my meditation pillow vertically and place it between my legs to elevate my pelvis (with a soft blanket or mat under my legs). I prefer to sit seiza over lotus about ¬æ of the time, for a lot of people it's a better form to sit, especially for sessions 1hr+.\n\nSorry to hear about your knee damage, hope it's not affecting you too much, but this is really great advice.\n\nPersonally I have two seiza (one adapted for use outdoors) and love them. I was never really a yoga person so never felt inclined to put the time in to get my body used to sitting in lotus.\n\nAn added benefit for me is the symbolic value of having a physical object which is intimately connected to your practice. A bit like having a yoga mat I guess. The presence of the bench connects me to my practice in a meaningful way.\n\nThanks for this! I've been meditating for around 3 years and recently I've been feeling some weird pain near my knees. I'll be sticking to a chair for now\n\n100% agree with this. I injured my meniscus and was out of sports and exercise in general for 4 months. Quite frustrating....went back to a chair.\n\nVery sound advice - thank you\n\nWhat meditation bench do you use? I am trying to find one because I ordered one online, but the legs weren't flush and it was uneven\n\nThe meditation bench is also damaging. After years of retreats and daily sits, now hip and knee replacements.  (No arthritis in family, no extreme sports, no accidents) .  Yoga didn't help but hurt as well. Joints need strong muscles for support, not stretching.\n\nQ.\n\nPermanent damage is a lie in a world of infinite possibilities. Nothing is impossible. People need to stretch and do yoga. And then meditate. An hour of meditation a day split up and divided shouldn't be an issue. We have the power to heal from anything. Unfortunately this message comes from a place of fear."

    "body": "Seeing as here theres always sorrow and people talking about wanting to end it, I decided to bring some light here.\n\nGuys please do your meditation. Focus on your breathing, once in the morning, during the day and before bed. All you gotta do is take 30 very shallow breathes through your nose ( as you inhale really stick your tummy out ) and then exhale gently out your mouth. In the last breath, take a huge inhale and hold that for as long as you can ( hopefully for atleast a minute ) finally exhaling it out slowly. This really helps teach us to remain within the present moment, help us mend the fight or flight state, not thinking about our past, not constantly worry about the future but remaining here, right now, where you are sat. Initially it‚Äôs pretty difficult as you‚Äôll notice your mind tends to fly off somewhere else during the meditation but all you need to do is acknowledge it for second, tell yourself no and come back to FOCUSING on your breath. After a while, you‚Äôll see how easy it becomes and that it becomes second nature. You‚Äôll start to notice so many benefits to doing this and you as a whole will feel so good, not stuck in your head/thoughts constantly which is just killing us more. \n\nI promise guys this is in my opinion the only way we can all resolve our problems within ourselves and you can go back to living the life you really want or once were. I wish all you guys the best.\n\nIf anyone does ever want a chat about anything, my dms are always open. You got this champ üí™üèΩ",

    "all_comment_text": "Make life your meditation! :)\n\nThat's right all of life of spiritual (inward) awareness\n\nExactly. Presence should be a 24 hour practice. Not just 30 minutes.\n\nYes and it is real work. At least one can find peace in the constancy of practice. The coming back again regardless of conditions allows you to be your authentic self regardless of how joyful or painful it is.\n\nYea, I‚Äôve heard so many people say they try to be present throughout the day and they spend their whole day distracted and in their heads.\n\nIt‚Äôs like having dedicated time to lift weights which will make you way stronger than lifting a pencil all day.\n\nYeah and learning to lean into the pain can be tough to say the least. But in the long run you will be thankful that you stuck with things and won't even think of your former self. Memories are obviously still a thing but are viewed in the present instead of something that takes up all of your attention causing you to spiral. You have a choice to make.\n\nAbsolutely.  I am part of a community called [Relatefulness](https://relateful.com) that practices integrating meditation with relationships.  I‚Äôve found it to be the perfect pairing to my 1700+ hours of meditation.\n\nBasically, if someone‚Äôs a dick then we tell them.\n\nTrue. But practice gives muscle memory, in this case, body/mind memory. So a focused practice (of any length) makes it easier to switch back to aware state any moment.\n\nYeah. I'm not saying you shouldn't meditate. I do it twice a day.\n\n[deleted]\n\nYes!! Push your self I love it, best of luck &amp; no problem üôèüèΩ\n\nThis post will help many‚Ä¶ peace, love and light to you kind sir üôè\n\nI really hope so, I myself struggled so badly with depression, and other mental health issues so I know how hard it can be. Things have really began changing for the better by implementing meditation, as well as cold showers. Just wanna get it out there as much as i  can. Appreciate you üôèüèΩ\n\nHi I have been consistent for past two weeks , I do 10 to 20 mins a day. I started it with the intention of increasing my focus. What exactly should I think after I close my eyes. At present I think of perfect day and try to think as clearly as possible but but but the reality doesn't seem to get affected so much from it. Any practices or thought process apart from the usual breathing techniques anyone can sure will be appreciated.\n\nThe idea of most meditation methods is not to think but to focus on awareness. So try not to actively think about anything. Putting the thought process to rest is one of the main purposes of most meditation types.\n\nInstead of thinking, focus on for example the breath (a very common method) or something else. And this usually means noticing the breath, following it. Not changing it or consciously regulate your breathing.\n\nThere are many varieties depending on what suits you and which results you are trying to achieve, but for mindfullness meditation, the most important part is to focus on your awareness, feeling the breath, carefully hearing any sounds, noticing physical sensations, etc. There is no active thinking in this type of meditation. You will notice that it is almost impossible to not have thoughts and thoughts will arrive. Dont fight them but also dont engage in them. Notice them and watch them disappear. \n\nThis is the core/basis of most meditation. There is of course a lot more to it but i can't get into everything here. Guided meditations can be very helpful especially if you're just starting out and dont know what to do (hint: as little as possible, is usually the answer. Meditation is mostly doing less,.not doing more. So less thinking, less moving, if thoughts come up dont judge them or engage in thinking about it, etc)\n\nAll you really want to be doing is to focus on every inhale and every exhale. Rather than just plain nothingness as we all know that‚Äôs difficult. And like I said above if your mind does ever seem to wander off, could be absolutely anything, just acknowledge that and then go back to focusing on the inhales and exhales. Won‚Äôt be easy but hey it‚Äôs the end result that‚Äôs worth it :)best of luck\n\nYou can try observing your thoughts as if at a distance, that will chase them away. It does for me, anyway. It‚Äôs a lot less jarring than abruptly stopping and carries no judgement.\n\n[The Mind Illustrated](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16pKrr74_4bnYc6GqQeScou9riGhxtst4/view) (free pdf download) is an excellent book for those serious about developing a meditation practice. Highly recommended. There‚Äôs also a sub: r/TheMindIlluminated.\n\nHere's a sneak peek of /r/TheMindIlluminated using the [top posts](https://np.reddit.com/r/TheMindIlluminated/top/?sort=top&amp;t=year) of the year!\n\n\\#1: [Do you guys swallow?](https://np.reddit.com/r/TheMindIlluminated/comments/1bq31b1/do_you_guys_swallow/)  \n\\#2: [Deep jhana and samatha from only 1-2 hours per day?](https://np.reddit.com/r/TheMindIlluminated/comments/1b90i3c/deep_jhana_and_samatha_from_only_12_hours_per_day/)  \n\\#3: [How does it feel to observe one's thoughts without engaging them?](https://np.reddit.com/r/TheMindIlluminated/comments/1455fek/how_does_it_feel_to_observe_ones_thoughts_without/)\n\n----\n^^I'm ^^a ^^bot, ^^beep ^^boop ^^| ^^Downvote ^^to ^^remove ^^| ^^[Contact](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=sneakpeekbot) ^^| ^^[Info](https://np.reddit.com/r/sneakpeekbot/) ^^| ^^[Opt-out](https://np.reddit.com/r/sneakpeekbot/comments/o8wk1r/blacklist_ix/) ^^| ^^[GitHub](https://github.com/ghnr/sneakpeekbot)\n\nCount your breaths. 1 inhale 2 exhale. 3 inhale 4 exhale. Up to 10 then start over. It‚Äôs hard. You‚Äôll lose count a lot. Sometimes you‚Äôll count to 17 before you remember to start over. But it‚Äôs good. Keep going. üòåü§ç\n\nThank you for the suggestions everyone, will go ahead with focusing on my breath as of now. Will post later sometime about what techniques really worked out for me . Also thanks again for the book recommendation will check it out.\n\nI do this weird thing when I try to sit still or meditate. I have a really bad phone addiction, and it's a form of dissociating. I'll lay down and try to meditate, and the next thing I know, I'm on my phone googling so random question, or scrolling through reddit, or start watching something on YouTube. I'll catch myself and then try to go back to meditation or stillness, and then it happens again without me knowing. It's involuntary, and then I just get to the point where I'm like screw it. Does anyone else do this? How do you stop? I'm also on my phone a lot because I use it for work\n\nI forgot to add that sometimes I'll end up getting up and walking around or trying to start another project. I have really bad ADHD\n\nYou could try leaving your phone in another room while you meditate.\n\nI've tried that. I still end up doing something else.\n\nOK. It was just a thought. Ideas are easy. It‚Äôs the implementation that‚Äôs tricky.\n\nBest to you. üôèüôè\n\nThanks\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôll catch myself and then try to go back to meditation or stillness‚Äù\n\nYou mightve heard it before, I think this is your process. You ARE cathing yourself and returning. It‚Äôs just that you, with your ADHD, instead of going off in thought, have actually went off. But as long as you notice and bring yourself back, you‚Äôre doing great work.\n\nWhat you can try to bring into the practice is a gentleness towards yourself. Instead of viewing walking off and doing stuff like a failure to your meditation, accept that that‚Äôs what your body and mind do, and bring them back to your stillness.\n\nIt may be difficult, and possibly there‚Äôs other things to consider or remove distractions, but seeing the process for what it is may help you.\n\nThank you. You're right.\n\nBest of luck my friend\n\nHow long did it take before you start seeing results?\n\nResults have been immediate for me and the more I do it regular it seems to be compounding, of course adding in therapy helps too.\n\nIt's not really a \"show me the results\" type of thing. It's more like if someone starts walking 30 minutes every day instead of taking the car everywhere. It might seem like a long way at first and they might not ever really notice the results per say, until after a while they realise to their surprise that 30 minutes doesn't feel like that long of a walk any more, and then the difference in health and vitality between themselves and the people who aren't doing it, or between themselves now and beforehand.\n\nIt's like but for your mind.\n\nYou're not my real dad!\n\n20 minutes per day routinely each day has helped me make leaps and bounds in my life\n\nThat‚Äôs amazing news, keep it up!\n\nGracias üôè\n\nDo People feel that their mind is not actually their mind but it's something which keep doing and thinking with like an autopilot mode and you are just observer of what it's doing..  it's like you are sitting smaller you on top of your head and noticing all this mess it's doing.... or is it only me feel like that?...\n\nI quit meditating and have been wanting to do it again... thank you for this! Will do it\n\nBest of luck with itüôèüèº\n\nI read messages like this once and did meditation for 2 years and felt worse.  I found some other somatic healing techniques that helped much more.  I'm considering trying meditation again, but if it doesn't work, I'm not going to feel beat down again.\n\nYou do you, there‚Äôs many ways to an inner calm. Meditation can help but it‚Äôs not the one and only answer. I‚Äôve learned Reiki, perform regular exercise, EFT and now I‚Äôve added brain spotting with my therapist.\n\nThank you!  I love this.  \n\nEFT has helped me so much.  I've been doing it for the last 3 1/2 years every day.  It has changed my life.\n\nI do a lot of vagus nerve, breathing and energy exercises.\n\nI want to learn brain spotting too.  I've been reading some good articles on it.\n\nThanks. You're right it's important meditate. In correlation with shadow work of course. Meditation can only do so much on its own. It's very powerful, but much more powerful is doing both :)\n\nYes exactly!!! I think incorporating freezing cold showers with meditation too can super helpful too. Best of luck\n\nMy response to people telling me how hard meditation is or they don't have the time for it is... this is not an easy path. But you just gotta get it done. Take a few minutes and do it. Just fucking do it. A consistent practice WILL change your life and make a world of difference for you and those around you. But you just gotta do it.\n\nAnecdotal viewpoint from me but it made things worse for me when I focused on it so much. But everyone is different.  When I stopped micromanaging myself into doing all the ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù things in life, my life turned around.  Sober now, exercise is a joy, my hobbies are fun again, etc.  Yes meditation is helpful but it‚Äôs not the only way.  Life is complex as hell and sometimes sitting and following your breath isn‚Äôt the right solution for some. But also, go sit more if it works for you.\n\nAfter some time, can you hear what you really want, like louder inner voice?\n\nHow does this help with the stresses life offers though? I don't get how it stops things getting on my nerves the way they do.\n\nIt‚Äôs teaching your mind to not constantly being lost in your head. The more you do it the more you feel emotion toward it and ultimately the more it makes you struggle till it just breaks you tbh. Meditating is teaching you to stop doing that and only focus on the presence, not dwelling on how life is affecting you. Or how it may become(anxiety).\n\nSo just for the 30 breaths? Is that how long you do it for or do you try for longer eventually?\n\nYeah so 30 is what Wim Hoff says to do in his book called the Wim hoff method. I do although sometimes do it 40-50 and it actually helps me hold my breath for longer after completing the shallow breathing.\n\nWhat benefits did you see so far? Just curious\n\nI‚Äôve been at it consistently for about a 1.5 years, I‚Äôve seen changes in how I‚Äôm interacting with the world, better relationships with others and myself and the first thing that has really helped ADHD without any nasty side effects of medications\n\nholding your breath for at least a minute is insane! I run daily for at least 15min and I hardly hold it for 30sec. I know it's doable but it's not something most people do\n\nDo the shallow breathing technique I mentioned above and then be shocked at how long we are actually able to hold our breath. 1 mins nothing, I once held it for 3 and a half minutes after completing the 30 shallow breaths. Give it a try, best of luck\n\nVery inspiring post! Thanks! Curious, after how many days of consistent practice will generally see the effects. Also what kinda effects did you notice the first time after regular practice every day?üôè\n\nAlso wanted to ask reco on any mobile app, pls? I could see so many apps and so many programs in it. Often time confuses what to use for consistent use without much thinking to start.\n\nI‚Äôve just set random timers on my phone, that go off at purposefully odd times, I use this for a mindfulness moment, bringing my focus back on the breath for 2-3 breaths and then back to whatever‚Ä¶this has been a huge help besides some more formal meditation at the beginning of my day\n\nIt took me a good 2-3 months. During that time was DIFFICULT. only because of how accustomed my mind became of always worrying about my thoughts. The goal is to keep pushing through until your body once goes back to how it was once upon time. Then you‚Äôll realise how hard it actually is to get lost in your thoughts once the meditation becomes second nature. Best of luck\n\nMay I know which mobile app that helped you all along for meditation? Also curious about any background ambient sounds did help?\n\nOf course it‚Äôs called Medito. It‚Äôs a must download, very helpful. Also all free. Best of luck\n\nThanks let me check it out too!\n\n[deleted]\n\nIt‚Äôs the only thing that can make us aware of our conscious. The way society is set up it makes us naturally subconsciously do things. Things that are habit and done without thought without even realising. I promise you there is something you can do. You just need to really embed into your mind the importance of it only then you,l be able to really practise it and eventually have a whole new outlook on life. I really hope things go well\n\nAny tips for meditating when you have house mice in your bedroom?\n\nIgnore It. They‚Äôre harmless. (Maybe consider an exterminator if it‚Äôs very much bothering you though)\n\n[deleted]\n\nSadly am allergic, but thanks.\n\nThanks, I'd been putting it off this week for some reason. Just finished 25 minutes :)\n\nThis post just radiates kindness. Beautiful‚Ä¶thank you ü´∂üèº\n\nRAW Power, heaven, plenty, bless, love, happy, yes. are my energies and focus for my meditat. yes maybe you like and use them also.\n\nAwesome post\n\nSo true.\n\nHow do you feel about youtube guided meditations?\n\nI know you mean good, but it's often not that simple even though meditation can be beneficial. Meditation is not a simple solution especially for suicidal people, who might also have a very complex trauma background. Posts like these feel very ignorant tbh.\n\nIn my experience meditation made me much more aware of all the things keeping me out of presence which were painful. I had to learn to see them for what they were and process them. Until I stopped caring about if the thoughts were there or not they had hold on me. If you fight the thoughts with resistance which will most likely happen for awhile things tend to get worse until they start to work themselves out. The thing with this practice to me is that it seems more like a way of living rather than a 30 minute daily band aid. Seated practice is great for gaining more depth but then off the cushion you can work on both attention and awareness and see how they come together and make each other whole.\n\nThis is an important post. Meditation negatively effects only a small portion of people with psychological problems, but those that think that they may fall into this category should consult their therapist before beginning serious practice (ie. overly long sessions, retreats, etc.).\n\nThanks for raising this issue.\n\nYes, I heard about \"void meditation\" worsening such backgrounds.\n\nThe whole purpose of meditating is so that an individual doesn‚Äôt go off thinking about traumas they‚Äôve unfortunately had to experience, a suicidal person is too busy THINKING about how they want to die, a traumatic person is too busy DWELLING on the past. Not that I‚Äôm pestering them for any of what they‚Äôve been through because it‚Äôs definitely not easy to deal with. But what is a person supposed to do? Numb themselves over man made meds? Neglect the complete natural ways to heal? I think not. Other than meditation imo lead to negative consequences. The mind is very powerful. The meditating is what is training the mind that it is not okay to always be occupied in the mind specifically when negative thinking, it‚Äôs making you remain present. That way you CANT dwell on what‚Äôs done or for what‚Äôs to come, or excessively, at least. \n Mindfulness!!\nI wish you all the best in what you may be going through, take care\n\nSo you're saying they shouldn't meditate?\n\nNo, but to proceed carefully. Breathwork could trigger worse dissociation if one doesn't feel safe in their body at all, and so on."

    "body": "I have maintained a daily meditation practice for the last 7 years. Sometimes twice daily and then some binge periods where I did 2-3 hours for weeks.\n\nBut........ to be honest, I was basically just sitting most of the time without much focus. And I knew it but just figured it was better than not \"meditating\". \n\nFinally, I decided to be as still as possible this past week and not fidget in the slightest way yet without being rigid. Normally I move my toes or fingers or shift my seating ever so slightly. But I resolved to sit as still as possible with slight spinal adjustments but that's it, nothing else. My overall awareness shot up. It requires a level of mindfulness I hadn't had since doing formal 10 day sits back in my 20s (47 now). \n\nMy experience has been that the focus on physical stillness settles me in very fast so that focusing on my breath becomes much easier. My thoughts are much quieter and less sporadic. And the effect is more pronounced throughout the day than my previous meditation efforts. More spontaneous meditative states here and there during the day. \n\nMaybe this sounds mechanical but it works for me. ",

    "all_comment_text": "Sitting without doing anything for 1 hour also takes a lot of focus, determination and patience.\n\nAnd this helped you build the foundation for deeper practices like stillness.\n\nEnjoy your journey ‚úåÔ∏è\n\nYour point about building a foundation istrue  it's like training mental muscles most people don't even know exist.\n\nYes! This is an excellent point. Serious commitment. I just started, wish I had been doing it for 20 years. Oh well, making up for lost time now¬†\n\nThat‚Äôs big in Zen. When you commit to stillness you have to let go of restlessness or discomfort over and over again. I did a zazen meditation at a temple last weekend and had a slight panic attack while working through it ha\n\nI remember a Zen teacher just slightly pulling back my shoulders and pushing my lower back forward with her fingers and it completely changed my posture and now I always think of those slight touches when meditating and it totally sets me back in alignment and stillness.\n\nHow long was the sit??\n\n25 sitting then 5 walking, then 25 sitting again¬†\n\nMinutes?\n\nYerrrrr\n\nI've got a panic attack right now, just by imagining it would be days.\n\nQuite the imagination there; better put a leash on that thing! ü§≠üòâ\n\nIn my very limited experience, the cool thing is restlessness becomes much much easier to deal with after you get through it a few times. Idk about discomfort as far as physical pain, never had that one go away¬†\n\nBe still as a rock, and become one with nature. Non thinking, non judgemental. Will lead to rock solid awareness\n\nbeautiful quote, I read them on the books The Art of Sitting and Full Catastrophe Living.\n\nAlso, Jon Kabat Zinn says something similar to this: \"Sit like a mountain, immovable, powerful, impotent\".\n\nInteresting.  I mostly am physically still when I meditate, but I occasionally need to swallow, or to scratch.  That is of course a distraction but then I try to return to the meditation.\n\nOne of the things that drove me to the deepest levels of my meditation experiences was instead of scratching that itch, observing it, refusing to scratch it and instead turn it into my focal point to drown out all other distractions. Still a challenge to this day, but it was a huge improvement in the depth of my meditation over time.\n\nYes, same. Observe, accept, let flow away.\n\n\nI haven't read anyone talking about it yet, but when I am still and find a sneeze beginning to form, I ask it to stop, and it vanishes.\n\nIt's not that I ask in words, I just intend that it shouldn't shake me or distract me from the stillness and then it doesn't.\n\nIt is almost magical and happens everytime. It doesn't even get to the point of me squeezing my nose.\n\nAn upright posture which you maintain whilst simultaneously relaxing the body and mind will allow the mind to slow and calm. It is global effortlesness that transcends slight difficulty (posture). This allows the mind to slow and still. This is the way it is in the late Dr Ainslie Meares method.\n\nI appreciate this post.  I‚Äôve been meditating daily and have been finding it difficult to stay still, but I noticed that when I did reach that stillness I wanted, I can feel the blood pumping through my arms and since I meditate with my middle finger and thumb tips touching c I can feel my pulse VERY WELL pulsing at my fingertips.\n\nI can only reach this level of stillness like one out of 3 times.  I love it when I get there though.\n\nRemember these 3 things as u start moving into pure awareness. 1. There is a lot of loneliness ; 2. A big emotional disconnect happens‚Äù it can bring negativity ‚Äú. 3. Being silent continuously is very very strenuous, very very boring and mind triggers a response. BUT hold on!! It takes a lot of time (maybe 3-5-10 years etc) to stabilise in awareness depending upon ur conviction, faith and steadfastness. Do IT. Then love flows ; all differentiation outside gets sucked by this awareness. One is happy, blissful and full of gratitude to one and all. In this state u don‚Äôt loose sight of awareness even for a second. It is lovely, beautiful, blissful and one starts loving the loneliness. The meditator Finds spaces to be alone to get one pointed in that state with open eyes. This is true! It happens with the dissolution of mind and desires. Then all just happens \nKeep at it. Never be satisfied with all your gains in meditation. as my heart opens up. Tough very tough!! Easy very easy if u get it. It is absolutely effortless and ALLWAYS there. \nRegards.\n\nThe stillness of body impacts the stillness of mind. Don‚Äôt however go against body‚Äôs needs like blood circulation, tendons etc. Take that flavour into post-meditation for the stillness to merge with movement. Enjoy\n\nI just listened to Adyashanti discuss the commitment to stillness: that if we commit to keeping the body still during the practice, the mind will inevitably follow\n\n Yes go deeper and move into pure silence. It takes u to awareness\n\nthis is what i recently observed as well in my practice too (and sometimes i forget what worked), keep going!\n\nGreat work! Really, it‚Äôs a huge development, and it doesn‚Äôt matter how long it took to arrive.\n\nIn my experience, I changed my relationship with fidgeting by looking for the feelings producing the fidgeting, accepting that i felt what i found as a need, and then wondering whether I could feel that as a want.\n\nCracking this led to many further granular divisions of experience, and now I either fidget from need and on my own terms or notice fidgeting otherwise as a kind of fraying awareness, that there currently exist sensations, real or imagined, pulling me away from here and now.\n\nBest of luck in all your continued practices!!\n\nAt least you learned the art of click bait titles\n\nüòÖüòÖüòÖ\n\nüëè üëè üëè\n\nSome people call this strong-determination sitting. I've also found it takes me to another level of practice.\n\nInspired by your post I sat today, on my mid-day session, with special focus on stillness and micro-adjustments.\n\nQuickly I felt a powerful Shikantaza experience. After the session I remembered a book where it talks about it: \"The Art of Sitting\".\n\n  \nThank you for the post :)\n\nYes, the mind cannot be still if the body is not still.\n\nWhat about movement meditations?\n\nThey can't go as profound as sitting. Moving meditation helps rest the mind and body and still keep a powerful awareness\n\nThis is what the Patanjali's Yoga Sutras are about.  The body, breath, and mind are all stilled leading to non-duality.\n\nThank you for sharing this!\n\nThis was insightful for me. I was doing the same. Thank you!\n\nI'm going to give this a try. Thank you for sharing and may your practice deepen.\n\nI honestly struggle sitting still anytime past 10 minutes because I get in so much pain sitting. Ignoring or accepting the pain doesn‚Äôt work because it literally gets worse and needs to be addressed or injuries start to form. Am I just out of shape?\n\nImho, stillness in any posture should give you immense benefits.\n\nwhich postures have you tried? i struggle with pain also and find sitting in chairs or on cushions difficult, but half lotus on the ground is much easier. when meditating sometimes i just accept that i need to switch to lying down every 20 mins and then sit up again. directing your awareness to tension patterns and releasing them helps. doing some yoga before beginning a sitting meditation also helps. ‚ù§Ô∏è¬†\n\nIm curious. Sometimes I find my body moves by itself as it relaxes and I let go of holding patterns. These movements are more like \"movement in stillness\". I am still but, the body shift. Did you allow these kinds of movements or did you \"force\" your body to be absolutely still.\n\nThe body releasing tension is good. Remaining still has allowed me to sense where I am holding tension easier than before. There isn't any force being applied to be still, but there is an awareness that this is stillness and movement isn't necessary for any reason.\n\nI am not always successful, but I observe the itches and twitches, and need to move, and recognise it as my brain‚Äôs way to distract me because‚Ä¶well‚Ä¶our brains like being busy.  I recognise it won‚Äôt last long, and focus on other things‚Ä¶how the ground feels beneath me, is one pant leg hiked up higher than the other, are shoulders down, jaw relaxed, the sounds I hear from near to far and back again‚Ä¶\n\nIf you don't want to sit so just lie on the bed. It's okay.  so long as you not sleep in that time.\n\nYoga nidra is great for this. Makes it so easy to stay still for long time, even with minimal/zero practice.\n\nwell thats what weight training and much of\nother body weight exercise does it forces you to focus on physical stillness after hyperventilating your breath until its zero\n\nFascinating!\n\nFascinating! Can you elaborate??\n\nThat‚Äôs an amazing accomplishment well done. And to have that self awareness to know what you need to change is great\n\nThank you for that insight.\n\nConsider adding a Lovingkindness meditation to your practice.  This is the engine of all meditation and through Lovingkindness you will be able to be kind to yourself during mindfulness meditation.  \n\nEnjoy.\n\nHave you done retreats or practiced with a tradition or teacher? Reading your post it seems like if you're going to invest so much time you should have some guidance on the proper way to practice. From my experience after attending multiple 10 day retreats there absolutely is a right and wrong way to practice and if you're not using the correct technique it's akin to rowing a boat with the anchor down.\n\nIMHO the state of stillness you describe has to be attained by releasing stored tensions.  That makes way for the stillness to settle in.\n\nJust my opinion.\n\nHow could you feel the detachment from your body if you were fidgeting?¬†\n\nThat wasn‚Äôt clear. Sorry! What I mean is that when I meditate I lose feeling in hands and feet first and then completely detach from my body. I only move if I have an itch or something bothering me or my position or something - something irritating enough to slightly pull me out and adjust but I cannot imagine moving around or fidgeting.¬†\n\nSorry for confusion and not understanding¬†\n\nGlad to hear you are continuing to meditate and enjoying it! Spontaneous meditative states happen to me all the time too - it‚Äôs wonderful"

    "title": "Three years of daily meditation!",
    "body": "Today I am celebrating three years of a daily meditation practice. \n\nMeditation changed my life in so many ways. I am a completely different person now. I used to be so negative and pessimistic. Always focusing on what was wrong in the world. Living in the past, stressing about the future. Trying to control everything and everybody. Desperately trying to make people love me. Miserable and blaming the world. Full of anger and resentment. Stuck in a victim mentality. Completely reactive. I was a mess. \n\nThree years ago today, I set a small goal to meditate five minutes every day for 30 days. During those 30 days I had a couple breakthroughs. I continued to meditate daily, but i started to increase the duration when five minutes started to feel like it was flying by. After 3 months I had another breakthrough. By 6 and 9 months I had a few more. By a year I was sold on the whole thing, and since then I‚Äôve skyrocketed to inner bliss. The breakthroughs continue to happen. \n\nI have grown so much spiritually and emotionally. I am no longer reactive. I no longer have any attachments to outcomes. I no longer try to control people or situations. I go with the flow. I feel blissed out for no reason most of the time. I feel love and abundance above all else. My anger is gone. My resentment is gone. I‚Äôve overcome crippling mental health issues, as well as addictions. I‚Äôve gotten off medications I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd ever get off of. I‚Äôve learned self love. I‚Äôve learned to listen to my gut and my intuition. I‚Äôve watched the miracles pour in. \n\nI have been single the entire time, just focusing on myself and my growth. Celibate for a lot of it. I feel completely transformed. Totally awake and in tune. I‚Äôm in the flow. I don‚Äôt worry or stress. I still have my triggers but I don‚Äôt experience feelings of fight or flight, and my triggers are fewer and farther between. I am healing in ways I never thought possible. And all I am doing is sitting in stillness, going inward and listening to my inner guides. I‚Äôm healing my inner child just by taking the time every day to go inward. It‚Äôs free. It‚Äôs beneficial. It‚Äôs the greatest gift I‚Äôve ever given myself and my family. \n\nIf I can do this anyone can. If I can transform like I have via meditation, anyone can. Trust me. It‚Äôs so worth it. \n\nMeditation for life. ",

    "all_comment_text": "Super stoked you‚Äôve found success. What is your daily meditation routine?\n\nSorry for the late reply. I typically meditate after my morning yoga for 5-20 minutes depending on time. I meditate before bed with a bed time meditation I use on Insight timer. Sometimes I will add in a breathing exercise or a sound bath. I also do walking meditations. And I consider journaling a form of meditation as well. I just try to stay focused on self care and make a daily goal to stay grounded in the present and to flow with life instead of. Trying to control things. I‚Äôm much happier now.\n\nI‚Äôm grateful you responded. Thank you for sharing\n\nCongrats :)\n\nFor me it was kind of different to be honest. I meditated everyday for two years and although there were some days I really needed it, it didn't make that big of a change. After two years I just stopped and nothing changed. It's confusing, I always believed that meditation is very helpful but somehow not that much for me.\n\nIt sounds like you need some guidance to take your practice to the next level.

Hasn't been nearly as transformative as people have claimed, for me at least. I'm not sure if the time I'm spending on the cushion is worth it, but I have an objective goal of 2 hours per day for a year, and if I'm still having the same doubts then I'll stop. But hopefully I have the breakthroughs, too!\n\nWhat was your medication practice?\n\n&gt;I set a small goal to meditate five minutes every day for 30 days.\n\nBeginning or prospective meditators take note. *This* is how to set the foundation for a successful practice. Make a commitment to practice even a short time *daily* and stick to it no matter what happens. Then if you want to continue, make a slightly longer commitment, gradually increasing the length of meditation sessions. Do this and it won‚Äôt be long before it feels odd if you miss a session. It takes patience and determination and perseverance, but it‚Äôs worth the effort.\n\n[removed]\n\nKeep it up!\n\nWonderful to hear! Well done and please keep it up (and keep ensuring it benefits those around you as well, beyond the benefits you are getting from it). \n\nOne thing I didn‚Äôt see you mention if you wouldn‚Äôt mind sharing a bit about, because I feel it can sometimes be overlooked and is a hugely important factor in our practice. \n\nWhat was your motivation (or expected benefit) when you first started? Has that changed at all and, if so, how would you describe your motivation for your practice now?\n\nSorry for the late reply. My motivation was to control my anger and my impulse issues. I was very reactive before. I felt like I lived in fight or flight mode. I just couldn‚Äôt feel grounded. I started doing yoga and reading a lot of different books about spirituality. Once I attained a regular yoga practice I was able to instinctively know that meditation was the next step for me. I truly feel yoga and meditation saved my life. I was seeking inner peace and I was able to find it with both.\n\n12 years here. I used it to explore. Inroads always being made.\n\nIt's pure quantum mechanics; observe is everyone else / un-observe is me. Neither observation nor non-observation.\n\nhow do you use meditation to explore? My background is Vipassana, so I'm curious about 'insight' meditation as I use it largely to focus on bodily sensations\n\nI employ quantum mechanics. When you don't look at others (the universe/reality), there is only self. Retrocausality, and in that I channel the highest possible experiences, like Jesus partying like Satan or The Buddha dancing like Krishna. We learn from our opposites. Do it a million times and you develop inner and outer supremacy. Always have a part of you that is living and meditating automatically.\n\nThe shaman-chief paradigm, alpha-omega. Reptile, sensory, emotion and intuition. Africa the far right (Royalty), south Asia is the centre-right (Peerage), the far is the centre-left (Monastic) and the west is the far left (Doctor). We don't clip together, but we compliment each other. [God and The Dao](https://contrib.pbslearningmedia.org/WGBH/sj14/sj14-int-religmap/index.html). Do it for every age of humanity and you will find your divine tribe; it's a requirement to transcend beyond base humanity. I spend most of my time in the physical, but occasionally I burst out into the astral.\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/sfnD6rH.png](https://i.imgur.com/sfnD6rH.png)\n\nHi,\n\nI'm very impressed you managed to do 3 years daily. I've been meditating daily for almost a year now, but I go through long phases of struggling to put real effort in and constantly getting distracted, and as a result it having little difference to my life. Do you have ways of getting around these long periods of distraction?\n\nI like using guided meditations on Insight Timer. There are thousands to choose from. I always choose one instinctively and am hardly ever lead astray. I honestly think there needs to be some kind of mind body awareness going along with the meditation which is why I always recommend yoga to accompany it. Everyone should do both. The world would look totally different if we all did.\n\nany specific way of practicing yoga you'd recommend? for example using YouTube videos? and do you do yoga daily as well?\n\nI use YouTube. I really like Charlie Follows and Kassandra. They have so many videos to choose from. I definitely do yoga every day. I function so much better with it in my daily routine. It‚Äôs helped me tremendously with chronic pain and depression.\n\nCongratulations! Your description sounds exactly like me and what I‚Äôve been struggling with the past few years. \n\nIt gives me a lot of hope and motivation to keep meditating when I see stories like this, thank you for sharing\n\nThank you for sharing your experience, it gives me motivation to keep up. Hope it will do the same for me.\n\nMeditation is only to fined the truth \nEverything else is imaginary \nSeek truth\n\nVery glad for you and very happy that you are experiencing the bliss of inner peace. \n\nContinue with the commitment to yourself. If and when you‚Äôre ready to take things to the next level, then consider doing Vipassana meditation of the Goenka/U Ba Khin lineage. There are centres all around the world and you only donate if you benefitted and also what you can after the completion of the course. \n\nI‚Äôve been meditating for the last 15yrs or so and can say the 10 day retreats turbo charge the practice ‚Ä¶..\n\nMost of the people on this forum have never had a breakthrough. Congratulations on keeping trying until it happened\n\nSo glad you are content now. But clue here is your Single and not in a relationship. This is why the Sages always lived off on woods by themselves. \n\nIt's much harder to get there and stay there with relationships. I have been there too when single and now when married. But things can throw you off trust me on this. I'm 60 this month been married almost 20 years. 11 years ago my in laws moved in. My world fell to pieces and I had to find new centers all over again a few times.\n\nLife is simple and easy single. Married even without children it's complicated and messy.\nEnjoy it while it lasts. Nothing is permanent.\n\nMarried and happy. I introduced my wife to meditation. I encourage practicing together 20 minutes daily. Two years later I noticed she‚Äôs more mellow.  We‚Äôre both less reactive to the world. Our compassion for others has grown and so has our patience for those that usually irritate or circumstances that would were upsetting now I see them for what they are and they‚Äôre not the giants I thought they were. Easier to face and handle life. Practice practice practice.\n\nWho pissed in your cereal? \n\nDamn, Debbie Downer. Damn.\n\nNo doubt. I've done the same thing in the same period of time with similar results, while working an IT job for a large global corp and I'm married (been together 20+ years). Cats but no kids though.\n\nCongrats OP!  Also, I feel like a new person too. But, that person feels like the same person as when I was a small child, just a bit wiser lol\n\nNot downer truth. Truth is real and sometimes harsh. But it's still the truth.\n\nIt's YOUR truth.\n\nNot everyone's truth.\n\nI hope you find peace again. ‚úå\n\nTruth is impermanence. Might be the only real truth.\n\nCongrats, OP! \n\nThanks for sharing! ‚úå\n\nThank you for sharing. This was very impactful.\n\nThis is amazing!! Very relatable - meditation is powerful and can be such a game changer to transforming yourself. \n\nIf you're just starting out and looking for inspiration, you can check out my meditations on Youtube or Spotify - Airlie Wellness. While meditating in silence is great if you are able to find the stillness immediately - that is incredible! I hope that these guided experiences can be helpful to stay motivated and focused on your own intentions.\n\nDid you go on any retreats? Did you get any instruction from experienced meditators in person or was it mostly DIY with internet/books/etc?\n\nI use insight timer or YouTube mostly. I love all the different options out there for guided meditations and sound baths.\n\nGold post.\n\nAwesome! So happy for you, keep it up!\n\nInspiring\n\nCongratulations my friend\n\nThank you üôè\n\nHow do you meditate/ what kind of practice do you do?\n\nSorry for the late reply. I usually meditate after yoga and before bed. I use insight timer to track my progress. There are tons of different guided meditations to choose from.\n\nCongratulations! As someone very new to this I‚Äôve been doing guided meditations. Do you just sit in complete silence and what do you think about?\n\nI use guided meditations or I talk to my spirit guides, angels, or passed on loved ones. I ask questions and get answers. I typically try not to have any thoughts. I just float.\n\nThanks for sharing. I am almost at 2 years daily meditation. I agree with a lot of this. The celibacy is a weird part of it for me to be honest, but I am improving as a person everyday. People don‚Äôt realise how much they can change their life for free\n\nCongratulations. I needed to see this, tjis morning. I‚Äôve been slacking and feeling like it wouldn‚Äôt matter anyway‚Ä¶I want to get to the level you‚Äôve reached\n\nSorry for the late reply. \n\nYou‚Äôll get there. Don‚Äôt give up! Try using insight timer so you can track your progress. It really helps keep me motivated.\n\nAs someone who is in the same boat as where you you started, this is really inspiring. I deal with anxiety, depression, triggers, trying to be the best I can be as a single mom of an 18 month, and some days it seems like there's so much effort for what seems like so little in return. I uprooted our life, leaving my daughter's father when she was 6 months old because we were not in a good situation, and moved across country to live with my mom, which has had so many of its own trials. \n\nIts much better than where I started when I first moved here a year ago, and I know it gets a little bit better every day when I take that time to focus on my breathing, to focus on my safe, happy memories, and to ultimately focus on myself. Your story gives me the motivation to keepin' on, keepin' on!\n\nThanks for the inspiration üôÇ\n\nYay! That makes me happy to hear. You‚Äôre obviously doing the right things. Keep it up and watch the miracles pour in. \n\n(Sorry for the late reply)\n\nCan you tell, what exactly meditation changes in our life ?\n\nSorry for the late reply. I now have impulse control. I pause before I react. So therefore I am much less reactive. I feel a sense of peace and calm. I am joyful in a way I never dreamed possible. My anger issues are gone. I don‚Äôt try to control things anymore. I stay in the present moment and go with the flow. I trust the universe has my back. I use the power of thought and intention to create the life I want. I consider meditation magic tbh.\n\nThank you üôÇ\n\nThis is brilliant\n\nCongrats! May you kindly share what method or tradition you've been practicing?\n\nKeep it up!\n\nI do yoga 20-120 mins then I follow it with meditation for 5-25 mins depending on how much time I have.  I typically use Insight Timer to find guided meditations to match my mood.\n\nDo you do by yourself or use a guide or something.?\n\nInsight timer. There are tons of different teachers to choose from. I‚Äôve never had to pay for any upgrades since they offer so much for free. It‚Äôs a great app.\n\nüåü May I rejoice with you üòä\n\nWhat is your meditation method?\n\nSorry for the late reply. I use insight timer to keep me on track and motivated. There are tons of teachers and meditations to choose from. You can never run out! I‚Äôve logged over 65,000 minutes!\n\nCan you share what kept you on your path? I believe there would have been days where mind would have suggested to skip and do something else, wanted to learn what helped you to stay on your path.\n\nSorry for the late reply. Insight Timer app tracking my progress has really motivated me. And also I set personal goals and try to achieve them. That and once I realized how much it was helping me I started looking forward to doing it. It‚Äôs literally the best way to start my day. I feel off when I don‚Äôt start my day with my yoga and meditation practice. It‚Äôs also helped improve my relationships with my children so that‚Äôs a major motivator.\n\nCongratulations. Beware not to become attached to your practice, one of the points of meditation is detachment. At a certain point, my teacher told me to stop meditating for a couple of weeks, and observe myself. It was a very enlightening exercise, I realized that I saw myself as meditator and that is not what meditation is about.\n\nCongratulations, mantras can enhance ur meditation, especially The Seed Mantras of the Universe\n\nCongratulations, mantras can enhance ur meditation, especially The Seed Mantras of the Universe\n\nJust earlier today I was worrying that becoming less reactive could prevent me from going with the flow and instead cause me to be excessively in control all the time. So I‚Äôm very interested to hear you say that you have become less reactive and also that you go with the flow more. Could you expand on this distinction please? Thanks :)\n\nSorry for the late reply. I used to try to control everything. I had serious anger and impulse control issues. Which is what ultimately made me realize I needed to do something drastic to change, for my kids sake. Now after daily meditation for so long I feel no sense of fight or flight, I am able to pause before reacting, therefore less reactive. I am calm, and centered, and in the present moment which helps me to go with the flow instead of trying to make everything be the way I think I want it to be. I am detached from outcomes. I am literally like a wave now. It‚Äôs incredible to me considering how much I struggled with these things before. Yoga helps a lot with the mind body connection. I think the two go hand in hand to be honest.\n\nMy meditation is mine. I read a bd contemplate how to apply the thoughts into my way of thinking and piece by piece replace one negative thought and add the new realistic and positive thought in its place and how I can use it. Thinking about it in bed puts me back to sleep and helps rid anxiety ridden insomnia. üôè\n\nMeditation helped me to realize how powerful my thoughts are. When I chose negative thoughts I got negative results. When I chose positive thoughts I started seeing miracles on the daily. We really do create our own realities. Meditation helped me to see that and to harness that power. It‚Äôs magic."

    "title": "Do not try to stop thoughts when you meditate",
    "body": "It‚Äôs simply pointless to try to stop or change any thoughts or feeling you have when you meditate. If you try you will only produce more thoughts. As Sadh-guru said, the mind is like a car that has 3 pedals which are all accelerators. There are no breaks when it comes to the mind. Whichever pedal you press you will only create more thinking. Try this as an experiment to forcefully make yourself not think of a monkey. You will find that it is impossible. Whatever you try to avoid becomes the basis of your consciousness. \n\nSo don‚Äôt try to stop thoughts when you meditate. Just leave the mind alone, and create a little distance between you and the mind. Let the mind run and just observe it as if it was something separate from yourself. See that whatever you think about is just an accumulation of impressions you have gathered throughout your life. There is rarely anything new happening in the mind. Even if you think about the future, it is still a projection of your past experiences masking itself as future. There is no such thing as past or future. This is only the mind‚Äôs projection. There is only ever this very moment. Past and future is in the mind. Just leave the mind alone. There is nothing interesting happening. It is all the nonsense from the past. You will find that it is very rarely you have a truly original or inspired thought. Most of what you think about is just garbage. It is all recycling of the old data you have already gathered. So you observe whatever is happening this very moment and leave the mind alone. \n\nAfter some time, if you don‚Äôt push any of the mind‚Äôs ‚Äúpedals‚Äù, the momentum will start to run out. The amount of thoughts will slow down and the force each thought has upon your attention will decrease. Then you may enter into a space where you have clarity and peace of mind. \n\nJust try to sit for 5 minutes like this. Don‚Äôt do anything. Just observe the mind and what is happening there. It‚Äôs helpful to be aware of the breath and any bodily sensations as well. Just see if you can sit for 5 minutes without pressing any of the ‚Äúpedals‚Äù in the mind. You may find that it is in fact very difficult and takes a lot of practice. This is meditation. When the mind ceases to have so much power over your attention, that is meditativeness. It‚Äôs a quality one has to work hard to acquire. ",

I like the analogy that you are a mountain and the thoughts are like clouds passing by\n\nthere is a one more like sitting on a river bed and you watch as water flows .. just watching without rejecting or getting involved in it .. :)\n\nJust notice and label.

Just using ‚Äòthinking‚Äô is limiting your insight potential :-)\n\nI recomend a youtube channel called \"The attentive mind\". He always emphasizes this concept of leaving the thoughts alone.\nA good quote I've heard in some of his guided meditations is : \"Leave your front door and your back door open. Allow your thoughts to come and go. Just don‚Äôt serve them tea.‚Äù\n\nThis is well put üôè\n\nNamaste.\n\nThat's really an interesting approach. When I meditate, I try concentrating on my breath. However; every now and then, my mind would wander; lose its anchoring and get lost in its own world. Upon realisation of the same, I bring back my attention to my breath and the cycle continues. \n\nWhat confounds me regarding your approach is how to separate consciousness from the mind. You talk about being a witness to our own thoughts and mind. For me, my consciousness resides in my thoughts. I am not sure how do I dissociate my consciousness from my thoughts and observe them like a bystander.\n\nBy focusing on breath and your mind wanders, you are allowing yourself to simply observe your thoughts and separate the two easier(mind and consciousness).¬†\n\n\nWhen you feel like the wandering thoughts are becoming more connected to your beliefs or notice them, in general, acknowledge that thought and return to breath.¬†\n\n\nIt will continue this way, until it becomes a deeper meditative state and thoughts simply move over your mind like you're dreaming but you will not be consciously reflecting those thoughts back as being yourself or of your creation.¬†\n\nI am not sure if I can relate to your experience. In my case, I am one with one my thoughts. For example, if I get conscious of the fact that my mind and thoughts have wandered, the thoughts also cease to exist and my focus gets back on the breath. So in my case, if I am having any thoughts, my mental existence is not separate from them.\n\nInteresting that it may be possible that you are achieving this meditative state differently that I am.¬†\n\n\nMaybe that's where the confusion lies: Some people really CAN stop their thoughts and achieve deep meditation, while there's others that CANNOT stop their thoughts, but they can achieve a meditative state by accepting those thoughts and consciously disconnecting your identity from them to achieve deeper meditation.¬†\n\nIt might be the more you practice the discipline of meditation, the easier it becomes to achieve that state of mind. So at the beginning you cannot stop your thoughts until you ‚Äúfall into it‚Äù. But after enough practice, you can enter into that state consciously.\n\nSaid differently, when our minds are busy or concentrating on some intellectual pursuit, our brain waves are usually beta waves. When we achieve the state of meditation we usually ‚Äúdownshift‚Äù into alpha or even theta waves, at times. (If you downshift all the way into delta, that means you‚Äôve fallen asleep.) So, initially, it‚Äôs hard to downshift from beta to alpha unless you allow your brain to go there naturally by observing the thoughts. The brain waves slow down and you start shifting into alpha. But the brain is like a muscle and the more you train it, the easier it becomes to shift into alpha without waiting.\n\nNarcoleptic individuals have got this down. Master meditators.¬†\n\nSame. I've tried to be \"the observer\" of my thoughts, but it's impossible for me, at least currently.  When I have a thought, my awareness is in the thought, not around it.  Quite often, I am able to catch myself entering a thought just as it births and redirect my awareness, but it's also common for me to get caught in the currents of my thinking and not realize it for a minute or so.  The realization doesn't come from another agent in my mind, but from the thought taking a turn or pause.  The concept of observing the observer doesn't really make sense to me.  It insinuates that there are multiple conscious minds in my one mind.  One participating in the thought, and one observing the participating mind.  \n\nI recently listened to a course on Insight Timer by a PhD who stated that there is no way to stop thinking (at least without drugs, a coma, or death).  She cited that one of the best-known Buddhist monks was only able to be thought-free for 15 seconds.\n\nExactly. However even though I haven't experienced it yet, but I am open to it. Sounds like a fascinating idea to me really. Imagine the potential it beholds. That way, we will not be really affected by any negative thoughts. Since it's difficult to stop thoughts or control them, not getting affected by it, if possible, seems like the next best scenario.\n\nI too am open to it. We‚Äôll see if it becomes a reality for us!\n\nI will add that the first time I had this breakthrough with meditative state that was deep: Time was insanely fast, afterwards when thinking about it. Also, you will think, \"was I just sleeping??\" however, I was not laying down and my head never really fell to indicate I am unconscious.¬†\n\nThis space between u and ur mind is very special. U will notice a distinct difference when u touch it. I would recommend trying a guided meditation called ‚ÄúIsha Kriya‚Äù. U can search on YouTube. üôè\n\nThank you. I have been following Sadhguru conversations and discourses. I believe the Isha Kriya you are referring to is the one that he recommends. Will check that out.\n\nüôè\n\nWell, think about it--  thoughts are produced subconsciously by the body, and they distract your consciousness. It is not you who is thinking those distracting thoughts, it is you that is telling your distracting thoughts to focus on the breath!\n\nThank you!üí´\n\nüôè\n\nI don't try to stop the thoughts I just focus on relaxing my body and my mind follows, with every out breath relax a little deeper and if I do find myself thinking that also means a part of my body has tensed up again so I return to the internal relaxing\n\n‚Ä¶return attention to the breathe.‚Ä¶\n\nI always stop thoughts when I meditate. Its the only way to reach the deepest states of meditation. You are describing mindfulness meditation, which has it's place and function but is not the only way nor the best way to meditate.\n\nI think there's some confusion here.¬†\n\n\nI understand what you're mentioning, but I've noticed what OP said of thoughts getting worse if you actively try to suppress them.¬†\n\n\nI've gotten into the deeper meditative state you mentioned by allowing the thoughts to wash over and return to breath. Breath will slow, deeper state will take over with thoughts simply passing by and I'm consciously awake.¬†\n\n\nIf I were to try to suppress those thoughts from there, I will instantly be pulled out of that deep meditative state and thoughts return to the forefront and I'm back returning to breath..\n\nSuzuki Roshi used to say, \"let your thoughts come and go, just don't invite them to tea.\"\n\nI like this üôè\n\nJon Kabat-Zinn Said\n\nI like most of what you said, except for the idea that most of what you think about is garbage. Your thoughts are part of you, it's not good to think of yourself as garbage. This doesn't invite peace of mind. If there is no past and no future, then no idea or datum can ever be the same as it was before, and never will be. It is always new, always changing, along with everything else. If we view our thoughts of the world as trash, the world will look like trash.\n\nU can create beautiful things with ur mind if u do it consciously. I‚Äôm talking about the never ending chatter of the mind that is quite unnecessary which most people are subject to.\n\nExcept, you are not your thoughts.¬†\n\n\nYou are not your mind.¬†\n\n\nThese are all external to who you truly are; thus, it IS garbage when it comes to meditation.¬†\n\nThese are a part of you. They are as much \"you\" as anything else.\n\nThose are created by you, yes. These thoughts also condition you to the world you live in.¬†\n\n\nIf everything you do, every decision you make, is done as a result of your own conditioning - are you really free, are you acting on your own thoughts only, and could it be that there's a higher self that has a better guide for you?¬†\n\n\nYour thoughts, while good, may be limiting you, if you allow that conditioning to be believed as 'all that you are.'\n\nSometimes I try to \"stop the thoughts\" or to not think of something and it works fine for me. Sometimes I even try to \"force\" my concentration on relaxing and it works very good as well.\n\nEverybody is different and you particularly most find what works best FOR you as the best practice skillsets you can have.\n\nIf you are trying to stop something you are doing something, and you should stop.\n\nThe desire to be free of desire is a desire.\n\nGood one. You have articulated the intricacies well. I recently read the book 'Dont believe everything you think'. I'll recommend this book for someone who would like some help on how to not think.\n\nüôè\n\nIt's like trying to get your heart to stop beating. The brain is designed to think. Your response to the thoughts, though, is where you have some control. If you let them go more often, your churning mind tends to subside a bit.\n\nRight üôè\n\nWhat you suggest is not meditation, in my book.\n\nThoughts coming, are thoughts going\n\nAfter meditating for some time, I've noticed that yeah, you cannot stop the thoughts. But with time, like you said, you become detached from your thoughts.. they keep running but it's almost like background noise once you've been doing it for a while.\n\nI like to take a nap when I have persistent negative thoughts. At least when I can do so\n\nMeditation is not about feeling a certain way. It's about feeling the way you feel.\n\nIME as an anxious person, it works when I think to myself while meditating \"what you want to achieve is already here and now, no need for anything else you anxious mf\" lol - not expecting results and not thinking about what I'll gain from doing it helps me a lot\n\nWhat's the difference between \"stopping / avoiding a thought\" and \"coming back to the breath or your object of meditation\" ?\n\nWhen I go back to breath, I kind of stopped the thought?\n\nDoes anyone else end up falling asleep when they meditate? How do I stop this?\n\nWith some practice you can meditate without falling asleep. It takes a little bit to maintain awareness and not dose off. Try sitting up or taking a cool shower before u start. Also, try at different times during the day.\n\nI just focus on something outside of my thoughts until I‚Äôm calm and the thoughts become blank.\n\nI just started my meditation journey this month. I'm finding this part difficult because I deal with intrusive thoughts that are very distressing in nature. Simply observing them and watching them pass is something I need to learn, but I'm struggling with it.\n\nVery new to reddit. Wow!...'s a super insightful comment. Thank you....\n\nRight. The antidote for thinking when meditating is to go back to breathing. It might seem like you're controlling something. But really you're just focusing on something that's a single thing which is the breath\n\nits all bout how we self reflect as a being ..  \nand i too agree with wt u ve  said over here .. the pedal one is so good of a example so easy to get for the begineers\n\nThe entire point of meditation is to slow down and then stop our thoughts. Mastering meditation is not hard, but we need to know what we are doing.\n\nThe problem is I can acknowledge those random thoughts but can't let them go üíÄ\n\n[deleted]\n\nObserve both\n\nI can stop thoughts without trying.\n\nI observe one part of my find suppressing other part of my mind. Then things get calm.\n\nThis is a technique actually rarely used by me. But today I am giving it another try.\n\nWhen I observe my mind, a natural desire emerges to suppress the previous thoughts. I simply allow the present positive thoughts to dominate the unwanted ones.\n\nYou‚Äôre absolutely wrong!. Couldn‚Äôt be more wrong!. Meditation is lack of thought. What do you think meditation is?. Let‚Äôs just keep thinking?. Exploring your thoughts?. How is that meditation?.\n\nYou are over complicating it. Those thoughts that cause me suffering, I just cut off.\n\nYou cut them off? Like with a knife? I just notice them and then move on to the next thing. If I try to cut them they'll cut me back lol.\n\n[deleted]\n\nThat"

    "all_comment_text": "30 minutes everyday after I wake up and brush my teeth. Been loving it since 2011\n\nCan I ask how you don't fall asleep while meditating immediately after waking up?\n\nI just let myself sleep if I am sleepy.  Body has needs.\n\nI‚Äôm a part of a zen meditation group where the teachers are all official zen buddhist priests in japan.\n\nI once asked how not to fall asleep.\n\nThey said if you fall asleep, it means you need sleep more than meditation. When you wake up, meditate then.\n\nAbsolutely perfect answer üòé\n\nAround 8 hours of sleep before, and by nature I am a morning person. I usually get sleepy in the evenings, so I avoid meditation later during my day. Also the utility for mornings as well, is everyone in my household is asleep and it‚Äôs quiet, and it‚Äôs the first thing I get done everyday so I don‚Äôt have to remember later.\n\nAny advice as a place to start for a first timer. I would like to explore the benefits of meditation but have yet to do research. Thought i would ask you. I like the idea of a morning routine such as you described\n\nStart with guided meditations that are short, maybe 5 to 10 mins to start, increase the duration as you prolong your journey. Make a note of your observations during meditation after, and research that.\n\nThis is the way‚Ä¶ I say this as someone trying to make a routine out of mindful meditation once again.  \n\nI practiced a lot more in my late\n20s, and the difference in my ‚Äúnerves‚Äù or explained further: how much I‚Äôm able to cope with, is so noticeable.  \n\nMeditation helps to make you more ‚Äúflexible‚Äù, like bamboo‚Ä¶ otherwise we get stiff, rigid, and unable to bend and weather life‚Äôs more difficult storms.\n\nVery kind of you. I do appreciate it\n\nYou could challenge yourself to sit with your spine straight for 5 minutes every day... Set a timer. It seems benign, but as with many things, the insights are hidden in the activity.\n\nI read Zen Mind Beginner Mind. Many years ago. It is now an audiobook on youtube. The book is incredibly easy to understand. The actual teaching of meditation there is uncomplicated.\n\nand thank you as well. I will be going to HPB tomorrow and buy the book as a treat to myself on Father‚Äôs Day.\n\nYou must study and do research for yourself. Any advice from other will get you curious enough to meditate for a few sessions but I assure you you will give up. \nOnly when you are driven from within with your own understanding of what and why you are doing, can this practice be a lifelong ally.\n\nYou must start with the breath. The breath dictates our emotional and mental states. When you are deprived of it, these functions stop. When you master the breath, you master meditation. So learn what you can about the Yogic science of breath. Then all else will fall into place and you will find a storehouse of bliss that never ends. Insights that no books could ever approach. Start there.\n\nIt‚Äôs common in Rinzai zen monasteries at least to stretch, shave and drink some coffee/tea before you meditate.\n\nEven at home, I only do a bit of breath work when I first wake up - then I jog, shower and do some yoga before I seriously meditate.\n\nEveryone‚Äôs different and it‚Äôs about experimenting and finding what‚Äôs right for you. You‚Äôre learning how the mine works first hand, so be playful about it.\n\nNot the person you replied to, but I struggled with sleepiness starting out. You get used to it, some days you're tired and that's okay. Try it, see what happens, and adjust from there, but you'll likely be okay.¬†\n\nI also used to have this problem until I started meditating outside mostly. I either sit on the smooth tiles in my backyard which are nice and cold/hard a yogamat or a lawn chair, often with a yoga block under my butt which helps me not get cramps in my legs.\nI sit cross legged but not lotus. \n\nSitting cross legged also makes a massive difference for the quality of my meditation but it could be different for you.\n\nWhen you are outside you either stay awake because of the sunlight or when there is lack of sunlight it is nice and cool. Hope that makes sense lol.\n\nThat's just what worked for me, other people might think differently, and to add a little nuance to this, if I want to really go much deeper into meditation, I do it in a dark room inside but I'll make sure I'm well awake for that.\n\nEdit:\n\nBtw I forgot, if you really want a sledgehammer to stay awake, regardless of location, do morning cardio, a cold shower and then meditate, I guarantee you will be so nicely lucid and calmminded in your meditation. The workout is optional tho, but the cold shower really does it.\n\nThat‚Äôs a mind set. You have to mentally prepare yourself for it. Just like you won‚Äôt fall asleep if you wake up early and have to catch a flight, similarly you must remind your self of the importance of what you are doing and mentally remain alert.\nFurther more it also requires that you sleep early to give enough rest to the body and mind. These two steps will help.\n\nWhy have i never considered making meditation apart of my morning routine instead of nightly‚Ä¶.. this is such a good idea tysm!\n\nMorning meditation makes for a better day, but evening meditation makes for better meditation. At least in my experience.\n\nOn retreat I often find early morning meditation (4-6am) a very powerful time. So still. The mind is fresh from having slept.\n\nMy mind on retreats is so different that it‚Äôs almost like another world.\n\nAgreed! You couldn't catch me dead meditating at 4am in the 'real' world! \nThat level of dedication is hard to cultivate outside of a dedicated time and place\n\n15-20 minutes a day, but, on some occasions, 5 minutes is better than skipping the meditation (don't make it such a big deal, do what you can to keep it as a daily practice)\n\nIf your goal is consistency I think this is the way to go, you can always meditate longer if you feel like it any given day. Or build up goals after this if you want to meditate longer.\n\n20 minutes twice a day.  As soon as I wake up and right before bed.  Once more mid day if I can get away with it.\n\nThis seems like a really nice balance.\n\nThis is my routine too. I meditate 10-15 minutes in the morning as soon as I wake up. I usually meditate 10 minutes before bed.\n\nIf I wake up late or I‚Äôm running late for some reason, I‚Äôll still take at least 5 minutes to collect my thoughts and do some breathing work. I feel it sets the tone for my day\n\nDo you set timers or alarms while meditating? Or do you stop whenever you feel ready to stop?\n\nI use the insight timer app, I use their timer and there‚Äôs a starting and an ending bell. It‚Äôs soft enough that I can continue meditating if I feel like it, but loud enough to bring awareness if I need to stop (e.g. if I have to get ready for work)\n\nExact same\n\nAround 4 hours a day. Especially since I am a mediation lawyer, I have to.\n\nI read that as 'meditation lawyer' haha but I guess you actually are\n\nArticle 5, line 17 clearly states that meditation must be done by letting your thoughts pass you by\n\nViolation is a misdemeanor charge with a maximum sentence of $1,000 dollar fine and 2 weeks in county jail.\n\nMe too!\n\nI think a lot of people are missing the joke here lmao\n\nGood lord, I‚Äôm over here on the opposite end of the spectrum with 10 minutes lol üòÇ\n\nHe mediation lawyer, not a mediTation lawyer.\n\n[deleted]\n\n\"Mediation is an informal process in which a trained mediator assists the parties to reach a negotiated resolution of a charge of discrimination. The mediator does not decide who is right or wrong and has no authority to impose a settlement on the parties.\"\n\nIt‚Äôs DISPUTE RESOLUTION. It can involve a variety of disputes from landlord/tenant, neighbor disputes, divorce/child custody issues and much more‚Ä¶the mediated settlement is formal and filed with the court or informal and signed by the parties and the mediator.\nBut‚Ä¶, back to meditation ü§çüôèüèº\n\nUnbelievable. You seems so jobless üòú\n\nüò≠\n\nI presume not all in one go..?\n\nüò± you are pro 4 HOURs \nneed guidance\n\nStarted to meditate 2 weeks ago. So far I've been doing 4 minutes per day.\n\nNice!\n\nI meditate about 25 minutes a day.\n\nI spend no time in mediation, as I am not a mediation lawyer.\n\nI am very deep in meditation\n\n10 minutes but without skipping the day. Consistency matters not intensity.\n\nI wake up around 5:15 am have a couple cups of coffee and then meditate for 1/2 hour around 6am. And every night I take my dog for about a 45minute walk where I listen to calming music, contemplate  on abstract questions and see what answers come to me. I feel that is a form of meditation as well.\n\nBetween 1 and 3 hours a day mostly. Big part of my life currently.\n\nWhat benefits have you noticed from your practice? Or insights? Also what does your practice look like?\n\ni know you didn‚Äôt ask me but i work a job where i‚Äôm doing still surveillance for 8 hours a day so i meditate on and off for 30-50 minutes increments until the end of the shift (equals to about 1-3 hours a day).\n\ni‚Äôve noticed \nA.) how freaking hard it can be to come back to the object (for me it‚Äôs the breath) and how easy it is to get distracted!! \nB.) if i really get into the flow, things start to feel really smooth, like slow motion. the mindfulness just comes, and as a result, i WANT to slow down. sometimes i start to hear ringing that fades after awhile of not focusing. \nC.) i‚Äôve become really aware of how reactive i can be to certain triggers or situations \nD.) that those triggers are informed by a super long string of events from childhood and (one could even say) dependent origination. \n\nyou also asked (not me) what the practice looks like! for me, i sit upright, with both feet on the ground, not crosslegged cus i‚Äôm at work and can‚Äôt sit on the floor, my eyes open, and a lot of focus on the belly / breath. sometimes i count in-1 out-2 in-3 out-4, but other times i just say in my head ‚Äúin‚Äù and ‚Äúout‚Äù because the counting can become more to keep track of and takes away from the present moment.\n\nMy meditation is basically yoga nidra. Meaning that I lie on the floor on a yoga matt. I do this because it enables me to reach deeper states with more stillness inside, because it unburdens postural muscles leading to a higher degree of the overall relaxation of musculature. I need this stillness, to achieve higher awareness inside the body making it possible to feel where my body, and especially my fascia is tight.\n\nI want to feel this tightness in the fascia, called adhesions, to be able to release it. And talking about benefits: Releasing such adhesions, changes my whole life. Often times when getting releases emotions or memorys come up. You have to imagine that these adhesions are not only physical tightness but also emotional tightness, unprocessed trauma to be precise. And releasing and processing trauma has gotten me a lot of benefits, less anxiety and depression and more confidence for example.\n\nTo my routine: I split it either into two session, one half in the morning and the other half in the evening or in three sessions with an additional session during the day if its possible.\n\nThank you for sharing! \n\nVery interesting stuff about releasing tension and t relating to emotions! \n\nI often find that while I‚Äôm meditating if I notice tension in the body and intentionally release it, I find that the tension is connected to the distraction that I‚Äôm thinking about in the moment or some emotion that I‚Äôm feeling and focusing my attention on. \n\nit‚Äôs like the body and the mind are connected in more intimate ways than we ever really realize in our waking lives, but that meditation has a beautiful way of illuminating for us if we allow it to.\n\nThanks for sharing! And I hope that your practice continues to give back to you as you give to it :-)\n\nYoure welcome.\n\nSounds awesome! Its interesting that you say the release is connected with emotions. In my experience tension even is most of the time a stuck emotion. And when the tension gets released the emotion gets released. \n\nAnd it goes even both ways. You can feel the tension and get to the emotion from there. But what one can also do is when you are especially feeling a negative emotion in your day to day life you can feel where it is in your body and it will lead you to tension.\n\nI agree with you that our bodys and our minds are much closer connected than most people think. Sadly though that the society is as disconnected from their bodies as it gets caused by endless distractions. And it shows in the amount of mental health issues and postural issues. Atleast in my understanding of these things.\n\nI am sure my practice will lead to incredible things because it already has. Right now I am even meditating much more than three hours because I have some time available haha.\n\nI wish you much success! :-)\n\nFor many months I could meditate only 20 minutes per day.\n\nNow I am able to meditate 45 minutes per day and I am happy with it.\n\nIf I will get seriously into practice I consider 2h per day. In my opinion any more that that is impossible for a person who works a full time job.\n\nAt least 15 mins per day to see max benefits\n\nMy friend told me they say if you don‚Äôt have 15 minutes a day to meditate, meditate for an hour lol üòÜ\n\nOld Zen saying: \n‚ÄúYou should sit in meditation for 20 minutes a day. Unless you're too busy, then you should sit for an hour.‚Äù\n\nHahah I just posted this without seeing you had already! üòÖüòÜ it‚Äôs my fav quote when people ask how much one should meditate! :p\n\nWhy do you think this is?\n\nPriorities out of line\n\nIt potentially implies that you are stressed out and rushing to do too many things, so many that you are having to skip on core routines you need to keep yourself healthy. Obviously sometimes one has to do that for a while, and it is an intentional choice, which is fine. But if it is not and you are allowing life to overtake you then maybe you need to meditate a bit more and think through what you are doing with a clearer mind.\n\nFirst thing after morning care.\n\nGo easy. You sound like meditation is something to be done, to gain something else. \n\nJust start. Just enjoy it.\n\nReminds me of Alan Watts and Krishnamurti. Thank you\n\n20 mins after around waking up and then throughout the day , it‚Äôs all meditation üôÇ‚Äç‚ÜîÔ∏è\n\nI agree.  So long as you are tuning in to your true self and letting whatever comes up, come up and out.\n\nI have it baked into my routine and do mostly active meditations. \n\n5-10 minute walking meditation while I slow sip my coffee. Favorite part of the day. \n\n30-45 minute run, during which I do the same walking meditation practices. Focus on the feeling of running. Recently I‚Äôve been focusing on the feeling of moving through air. Feeling the air brush past me. And there‚Äôs a specific sensation of moving forward through space that really holds my attention. \n\nI finish the run at the park and do sun salutations then a 5-20 minute seated closed eye meditation in the grass. \n\n5 min walk home. \n\n\n10 min Shower is meditative. \n\n30 minute yoga nidra most afternoons. \n\n\n2 or 3 10 minute walking meditations. \n\n\n\nThe whole 20 min seated twice a day process never seemed to carry over into normal waking life like the active meditations do.\n\nSo in an average day I‚Äôm probably doing something I‚Äôd consider meditative for 60-90 mins a day.\n\n20-30 early morning.\n\nSame later, if I have the time.\n\n10-15mins.\n\n5 seconds\n\nThis gotta be me üò≠\n\n3-4 hours¬† a day. Twice a day atma kriya yoga, once a day abishekam, and over 1 hour of jappa.¬†\n\n20 minutes.\n\nFind a teacher/program and stick to it\n\n1hr to 2 hours. Separated by 30 min sessions tho!\n\nI‚Äôve just gotten back into it so the most I do is like 10 minutes in the morning. Tryna get better tho\n\nI am not a mediator‚Ä¶\n\n20-30 minutes every morning. 15-20 minutes before bed.\n\nStart incredibly small and easy to efficiently establish the automaticity of a consistent habit. Pair it with a specific trigger. The when doesn't matter as much compared to when a good trigger in your day comes up. Stick with once a day.\n\nKeep it small until it's really solid, then naturally let it grow.\n\nThen modulate the practice to grow it. 15 min of one, switch to another, then another. You might find that this allows the time to grow subjectively easier.\n\nThen do long (45 min - 1 hour) sits of one for a few weeks. If you feel like you're making progress, keep going. If you hit a plateau, try another technique.\n\nStart training in progressively difficult yet controlled situations, like with video games or during a tense movie. Go back down to small times for this. \n\nExperiment with ultra long and ultra short times.\n\nTake a class or join a community.\n\nMorning and just before bed are best for me. I‚Äôm that limnal place it is easiest to drop in. I will often take small meditation break during the day when I notice I am antsy. 1-10 minutes typically . I have used mindfulness bell (app) for random reminders to take a minute during the day too.\n\n\nWhile a schedule is helpful to be consistent, I would not get too hung up on when and how long or any metric. Just be with it\n\nAbout 2.5 hours. Might sound like it‚Äôs too much but it‚Äôs turned my life around\n\nYou are meditation!  You play the character for X amount of hours.\n\nWith amazing commitment and concentration!\n\nbars!!!!\n\n10 - 15 minutes\n\nAn hour\n\nPersonally I like having a minimum rule and then freedom above that. So 10 minutes a day because I reason I should always be able to find 10 minutes, but ideally usually 20, and on weekends often 30-45mins, but because I want to not because I have to in order to meet some goal, the goal is only ever 10mins. \n\nHaving a minimum I think helps it stay as a daily habit so you always sit, but not having an ambitious number means that on days where you don‚Äôt feel like it or are really procrastinating you only have to do 10mins, which seems doable, and then can decide to do more because now you‚Äôve sat down and are ready to start and you realise you would like to spend longer. (Especially because procrastinating itself is a sign you need to meditate a bit longer that day‚Ä¶ you just have to get over the procrastinating first)\n\nAn hour in the morning and an hour in the evening works well.¬†\n\nOn my day off from work I meditate 15min twice a day, working days only at night before bed 15min\n\n10 minutes is my gold spot. Any longer and my brain feels like it's dying, any less and it doesn't feel quite right. Props to people who can meditate longer but there's nothing wrong in being a sprinter over a long distance runner.\n\nI've been practicing on and off for a long time, in the past two months I started doing it on a daily basis for like 10-15 minutes per day, every morning. I'd say start small, a few minutes per day just to make it a habit. Then increase the duration if you feel like it :)\n\n10 minutes everyday for the past three and a half years. I haven‚Äôt skipped a single day. Some days i go longer, if i feel like it. But not more than 20 minutes. Consistency is key when it comes to meditation.\n\nYou do whatever you can. If you can only start with five minutes at a time then do that. Then jump to 15 -20 minutes. The next step is to work up to an hour of three 15 minute sessions with a five minute break in between. Then you work up to an hour uninterrupted. That would be a good maintenance level.\n\nWhat I‚Äôve noticed is the chatter doesn‚Äôt really calm down and shift states into settling for me often until about 45 or 50 minutes into it -  I would never get to that deeper level if I didn‚Äôt go for that long.  \n\nIt‚Äôs also nice to mix it with some yoga stretches. Flexibility of mind and body. Hip openers like the pigeon pose are useful for sitting long periods. \n\nDepending on your teacher it may not be considered particularly beneficial for you to push yourself into a lot of sitting meditation until you‚Äôve developed other qualities first like what is developed in ngondro or it ends up making your rigid rather than flexible and fluid.\n\nRead Zen Mind Beginners Mind by Suzuki if you haven‚Äôt.\n\n1 hours per day\n\nit's better to make it short and regular than long and irregular.\n\ndo 5 mins in the morning 5 mins at night first.\n\nCongrats on finding your way back! \nI meditate anywhere between 10- 90 mins, 1-3x‚Äôs a day(give or take) depending on time &amp; stress level.\nMy basic routine is: mid-morning, mid to late afternoon, and before bed. If you are concerned about falling asleep, find a somewhat uncomfortable position.\n\nWhen I veer off track or just have difficulty focusing (thanks to AuDHD &amp; chronic pain) I‚Äôll seek guided meditations I‚Äôve not heard before, switch to walking meditation, and/or hit my neighborhood ‚Äúfloat‚Äù spa (i.e., sensory isolation tank/float pod), which I highly recommend trying if you can.\n\nOn average? About 0 min. But I stay in this sub to remind me to pick it up again sometime.\n\n3mins when I wake up, then I write for 5-20mins\n7mins after evening shower\nAnd between 15 and 20 when in bed\n\nSo, 25 - 30 mins per day\n\nBut I started with just 3 mins a day, then 5, then 7, then started meditating multiple times a day.\n\nAnd I guess I meditate throughout the day but I don't set the timer, it's if I'm waiting for a bus, or sitting in a park or other random situations\n\nI would say even paying attention to one breath is meditation\n\n15 to 20 mins in two sittings. I used to believe length mattered but have come to realize for me it's about making a connect inward and it's like touching home base. Once there, it's not like filling up a tank of gas. There is there and so once reached, while remaining in meditation is pleasant, it's not truly necessary. To me.\n\nabout 50 minutes\n\n15-20 mins is good for me.\n\n20 min\n\nBlessed is he (or she) that meditates twice a day...Namaste üôè\n\nI read somewhere that you should meditate for as long as your age in minutes. Can‚Äôt remember where I read it\n\nNot often enough and don't think it's necessarily about how long. Usually after a hard workout or before bed.  I just get into a calm and relax state and enjoy it until my peace is broken, or I've had enough of that tingling brain sensation. I could use more.\n\n30 min. Audio Dharma has a great meditation podcast that is totally free and most lessons are 30 min\n\n0 minutes. When I was depressed it was 30-120 minutes.\n\nIt helped me to overcome depression.\n\nI try for at least five minutes\n\nDepends. Mostly just 10-15 minutes, mostly during the week. Weekends I'll do up to an hour or so.\n\nI try to do 15-20 mins twice a day. Sometimes just once.\n\n30-60 min\n\nMy body is the church and I‚Äôm always at prayer\n\n10min\n\nUsually 15 to 30 min right after I wake up. But life happens and I‚Äôve been missing some days the past couple weeks. I can definitely tell a difference on the days I don‚Äôt meditate.\n\nMm\n\n30 mins on Sundays, mainly because I don't practice law\n\n3x a day, 20 minute sessions.\n\n108 breaths, I focus my 3rd eye on each finger and toe, to count - Om Namah Shivaya üôè\n\nI try to do 5 mins per day and practice mindfulness when I practice yoga and walking \nSo far, it's been working well for me. I'd want to try at least 10 mins per day. Hopefully this year\n\nMinimum 21 minutes per day\n\nIt varies for me! I also wish I was consistent‚ÄîI used to do from 3 minutes to start my day to an hour at times when I needed to connect with my body. I used it as a way to connect, be in tune with my body and my feelings/thoughts. Hope this helps! ‚ô•Ô∏è\n\nI cant do more than 10 min. Maybe I should be doing it for longer\n\nI do 40 minutes and always when I wake up before work. This is the perfect time length for me and it sets your mindset up for the rest of the day. You sort of enjoy being around people a lot more when you do it regularly. By default, I'm not into being social, but this does help.\n\nMy goal is 20 minutes in the morning and 20 minutes before bed. Sometimes, it‚Äôs impossible to stick to it rigidly, like if I have an early morning appointment. But then I try to get in at least 10-15 minutes after my appointment. I almost always take time for that 20 minutes before bed, though.\n\n30min lately..it's been amazinggg\n\nMy preference is 20 min but I don't always have that much time. 10 to 15 is probably my usual as I like to meditate on my bus ride home. Some days all I get is 5 min though.\n\nTwice a day from 5-30 minutes each time\n\nI spend a lot of time in the garden so I try my best to do walking meditation. If you count that, then 30 mins!\n\nAll of us collectively? Or just each of us individually? Just kidding ‚Äì ‚Äì I‚Äôm in a wacky mood to start the weekend.\n\n12 minutes is my daily default.  I try to extend from formal cushion time once I get up and go about my day, as well.  I‚Äôve learned that 40 deep and calm breaths is the equivalent of about 13 minutes, which allows me to ditch the smart phone when desired.\n\nI meditate every morning first thing when I wake up. I do anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour. If I feel tired or sluggish in the afternoon usually around two or three, I will do a second meditation.\n\nI aim for 15 minutes morning and 15 minutes night.  Sometimes omly once though or shorter\n\n20 minutes. First thing in the morning.\n\nI‚Äôve just started meditating again after a long hiatus. I‚Äôm doing 10 minutes a day right now:)\n\n20- 150mins of yoga a day and often just sitting by a river.¬†\n\n15 minutes a day, whenever I feel the urge. If I have a particularly poor session, like I fall asleep or just can‚Äôt focus, I do it again later. Also try to grab little moments throughout the day. Even 30 seconds has a positive effect.\n\nYou should meditate 20 minutes a day, unless you‚Äôre busy then you need to meditate an hour a day!\n\nI usually meditate 10-30 minutes daily depending on how busy I am.\n\nThe best way to make it into a routine is to make it easy. Don't expect yourself to meditate for 2 hours a day when you're getting back into it.  Rather, say to yourself that you're going to meditate for 10, 5 or even a few minutes.  While length of time has some value, what's more important is that you create a routine that you know you can stick with.  Consistent practice is essential; I cannot stress that enough.\n\nOnce you get into the flow of the routine, then you can consider lengthening the duration to how you see fit.\n\nAs for what time of day, it's hard to say what time is the best.  But for me, I like to do it first thing in the morning because it freshens my mind, which is a great way to start the day.  But nighttime is also not a bad time to practice either since it can help calm your mind and prepare you for sleep.\n\nDepending on the day, I may only meditate while in action, but if I can I'll meditate more formally for just five minutes to 30 minutes......\n\nTraditionally 30-40 mins. The last week I have jumped up to 90+ mins and have felt incredible results.\n\nWhenever I am doing absolutely nothing and lost interest in my phone I find it‚Äôs a great thing to do to overcome boredom. Easily pass 30-45 minutes per day. If I realize I haven‚Äôt meditated today, but I‚Äôm not in the mood for it I just don‚Äôt do it. Rarely do I miss a day\n\nI think the best thing to do is to integrate meditation into your routine when it works best for you. I‚Äôve been meditating for around 4 years now on and off and the timing of how long I do it is all based on what I intuitively think I need. What I do now is meditate for even just 5 mins to 2 hours depending on what I am needing whenever I have down time in my schedule. I used to mediate in the mornings but found that I fall right back asleep so I always do it in the afternoons now, it‚Äôs all on what works for you :)\n\n30 min. I started 2 years ago with 45 and maintained for 6 months but I didn't fit in my schedule.\n\n30 to 45 minutes every morning. I wake up, make my bed, drink water then sit for meditation. So, if I overslept I won't get the full 45. Most days I do though.\n\nI usually meditate before sleep, it helps me wind down and that‚Äôs usually when I find time.\n\n15-20mins a day (most days).\n\n40 mins once or twice a day is optimal in my experience.  doing 4 hour sits currently\n\nI started with 10 minutes in the morning and did that for awhile and I've moved up to 20 minutes. Sometimes if I feel like it, I'll do another 10 or 20 at night. 20 minutes seems like the sweet spot for me but I definitely feel like I should do more because it feels great. Often when I hit the 20 minute mark I could easily keep going for longer and often want to.\n\nI am trying to meditate every day and average around 20 minutes.\n\n23mins\n\nI aim for 10 minutes but most of the time it ends up being 15 cause I realize my brain is tooooo busy for the first 10.\n\nJust starting here. 15 minutes in the morning and 15 or 30 in the evening.\n\n18 minutes per day is ‚Äúrecommended‚Äù to building habits and mastering distractions\n\nMost mornings, I do a gratitude list with at least five things.  I use an app that rings bells that I have preset for 12 minutes. If I go back to it later in the day, I will sometimes do a guided meditation.  However, I‚Äôm also a swimmer 2-4 times a week, and I consider that a meditation too. When I swim, I‚Äôm not racing or trying to beat some arbitrary goal, but rather doing my laps and letting my body regulate the pace‚Ä¶which starts slow and ends up pretty brisk.  I focus on counting the laps‚Ä¶almost like the bells in the morning.  Stating the number in my mind returns me to moment with my body and breathing.\n\nFor the last few years I‚Äôve been doing an hour a day: 15 minutes of following my breath early in the day; 30 minutes of mantra in the afternoon; 15 minutes of following my breath before bed.\n\nI‚Äôd like to increase the length of the breath sessions and add some metta, but so far haven‚Äôt been able to fit it in.\n\nStart with 5-10 mins everyday..twice iffff u can...and by if I mean it shouldn't be by force and u dont want to but have to\n\nStart with less then after 2weeks add 5mins..its better to meditate when you wake up before u eat anything (drinking waters ok)..and thats because its like programming ur mind and soul at the very start of the day so whatever u do is from that place\n\nBut again if it feels forced try to do atleast once everyday whenever in that day..but everyday\n\nThen when u start rolling then do the other stuff...like when u wake up (atleast 30mins)...twice everyday atleast...even better if u do it every 6-8hrs\n\nAt night meditate 2-3hrs before the time u plan to sleep so that ur brain isnt awake from the meditation.\n\n6-5 hours, day yes day maybe day why not\n\n30 min right after i get up, and 30 more at lunch.   \nKriya Yoga meditation.   \nthis year is 50 years. Haven't missed  a day. .\n\n3-4 per day.... \nIn bed\nIn the studio \nOn the bike \nIn nature \nBy the sea\n\nNo particular timeframe. \n\nGreat news is, the presence of silence is available 24/7... \n\n‚ú®üôèüòéüåÄ\n\nI do TM: 20 minutes AM, 20 minutes around 3:30 PM.\n\nLearn TM! I do a 23 min session twice a day\n\nI don't have an exact amount. As long as I practice every day I'm happy.\n\nWhen you were in a meditation routine did it help? And how?\n\nI've been doing 10- 20 mins about 4-5 days a week, somme weeks are better than others. But recently, I have been trying to extend the practice to 30 mins sessions which I have found better and feeds through to my everyday life better.\n\nThis is what works for me at the moment. It really does take time sitting to start experiencing the benefits.\n\n15-20 minutes right after I wake up and brush my teeth. I‚Äôm way more relaxed and I don‚Äôt have much on my mind right after I wake up so it‚Äôs easier to just sit, breathe, and enjoy the moment of silence\n\nStart slow and build up if feeling good\n\nLonger than anybody! I'm the BEST meditator. Just tell me how long you meditate and I will meditate more than that!!!\n\n20 minutes max. 5 - 10 minimum if very busy.\n\n0 üôÅ I miss it so much. I don‚Äôt know why I can‚Äôt motivate myself to do it right now.\n\n30 minutes.\n\nI will meditate or do breathwork daily and I‚Äôve kept the habit because I give myself flexibility on my time. Some days I have more leisure time and I‚Äôll ensure I set aside ~30 minutes. Many days during the week I make 10-15. Busy days I‚Äôll take 1-5 minutes!\nBecause i let go of my time expectations, the practice felt more welcoming and accessible. ‚ÄúLetting go‚Äù was the thing that enabled me to build a daily practice !\n\nI'm new so I do 5 minutes in the morning. For now it's the perfect time\n\nHow do you read other peoples comments when I click on the comment icon just brings up a chance for me to comment\n\nI enjoy meditating right before bed. I do affirmations and a 30 minute meditation and then I also use that time for intention to either lucid dream or go out of body using the direct method or indirect method.\n\nMinimum 20 minutes and maximum 40 minutes every day is what I aim for.\n\nmon - Fri 35 mins, sat-sun 2hr 20 minute\n\nI wake up a little earlier before work and meditate for 10 minutes to get my day started. I do about 20 minutes before bed. Trying to get into more lengthy times! It‚Äôs the best feeling honestly.\n\nI meditate for 21 minutes twice a day during morning and evening between 5.40 am/pm to 6.20 am/pm . This routine I have been following since 2018.\n\nYogis have prescribed certain times to meditate per day which I will share with you. Meditating two times a day is a basic ask, with smaller meditations anytime you find space in between the day.\nThe two times can be about an hour or more. \nThe best time to do meditation first is by waking at 4-4:30 am. If you regularly wake and mediate at this time you will find the quality of meditation is way superior than meditation done  at any other point of time in the day. The time between 4-6 am is called Brahmamuhurata time and you will find the least resistance during your meditative efforts then. The key is to wake up and quickly get down to meditation without letting your mind get too active by doing any other work. Just wash your face and mouth, sip a little water and sit. \nThe best one hour meditation can be in the evening anytime between 4-8 pm.\n\nAbout 16 hours per day I try.  As I walk, I watch for the source of my thoughts and thinking goes away.\n\nUsually 10-20 minutes in the morning for me\n\nI am married, so mediation is a requirement of at least 75-125 minutes a day ü§™\nBut in all seriousness, we practice 4:7:8 breaths 4x in one session for 2-3 sessions per day. Typically with a 3-5 minutes focus post breaths.¬†\n\nIm Muslim and I perform prayers 5 times a day. At dawn (before sunrise), at noon (when the sun is at its highest point), around 4PM (when the sun begins to set), at 8PM (sun set), and at 10 PM (when the sun is completely down). Around 5-10 minutes each time. \n\nI don‚Äôt know much about meditation, but it would be interesting to know if someone does sun salutations or other forms of meditation or yoga in sync with the sun like us Muslims do.\n\n2 hours\n\nVipassana\n\ni‚Äôm struggling to do three minutes\n\n15 mins\n\nI try to meditate for the first 6 minutes of my lunch during the week and about 6 minutes before bed on the weekends (when I remember lol)\n\nI started with 3 minutes when I wake up and before I go to sleep. Mainly for the habit. Once it git easier I increased time incrementally. Now I do about 8-15 minutes a session. If I don't want to do it I do 3-5 minutes just so I don't lose the habit.\n\nAbout 2 hours\n\n2 meters per day\n\n20 minutes total. 10 min in the morning and 10 in the evening. Started doing it a couple of months ago and I am very glad I did."

    "body": "Is the brain like clay? \n\nExperienced meditators, have you ever felt that at some stage your brain becomes more plastic, and personality changes come very easily? It‚Äôs as if you start to see the absurdity of the beliefs you held about yourself and your automatic behaviors, realizing that they can be rewritten from scratch quite easily.\n\nRight now, I‚Äôm encountering this feeling of incredible ease because of this sudden realization. I understand that these personal changes aren‚Äôt something that happens in a day and that they require building new habits. However, I‚Äôm genuinely surprised by how easily the brain can actually adapt and change.\n\nAt the same time, I‚Äôm a bit scared by how vulnerable the brain is to various beliefs. At one point, I realized that everything rests solely on people‚Äôs faith in certain things and that these beliefs are generally easy to change because the brain doesn‚Äôt care much about what it believes. The fear comes from being scared to believe in the ‚Äúwrong thing.‚Äù\n\nFor context: I have secular beliefs and about 300 hours of meditation practice.\n\nUPD: By ‚Äúeasy,‚Äù I don‚Äôt mean simple, but rather possible‚Äîespecially for those with certain privileges. In my case, it‚Äôs been a mix of hard work and luck that allowed me to reach these realizations.

And I'm not saying this to dunk on him at all, I love me some Alan Watts, it's just not something that I think is widely known\n\nYou listen to him enough and you can see it. He's constantly going on about how the material world is our playground and we are meant to enjoy it. I hope he did enjoy that vice rather than it being a compulsion.\n\nYeah I agree. The poor guy I don't think the drinking was an enjoyment at all times. I'm sure he's like me, unable to bear social interaction without training wheels. He's good at talking \"at\" you, creating a character, but perhaps not the perfect listener or the most truly connected with those around him? I'm making assumptions. But I know my own vices, and why I can gravitate towards alcohol or have in the past(not to mention the \"need to perform\" aspect which almost certainly comes from childhood). It's an inherent discomfort with the reality in front of you, and it is terrible, but alcohol lessens the pain. Personally, I have overcome alcohol but if I had a responsibility to talk on stage like him, it may reignite that old thing if I'm not at my best \n\nOf course I'm just comparing my own self to him. But I feel like I can hear it in his voice sometimes\n\nYeah I didn't know that, thanks!\n\nHe shot himself when he was drunk I believe\n\nShot himself? He died in his sleep from heart failure.\n\nYou can be shot and survive.\n\nI never knew that, but I'm the tiny minority that always felt he was a poseur.\n\nNot often you read a quote, and the speakers voice reads the quote in your mind.......\n\nI like to bring up this around the topic--  \n\n\nIf I play a video game long enough, sometimes I have a dream where I am in the game, and that this is ordinary. I mean, I have had this about 2D games; and I was just this avatar on the screen, and this is how I moved around--  Not that I was \"in the game reimagined from that perspective\", but actually that my looking at the screen and moving around was my reality, but instead of controlling it, I simply was it--   \n\n\nI bring this up because, this is how willing and ready our mind is to accept new premises of reality-- Play the game long enough, and my mind will recognize it as the reality of the situation to some degree--\n\ni just started playing this little 2d platformer called Noita and have experienced exactly this. i even felt strange taking a hot shower today when lately i've been more than happy to swim in pools of blood and sludge\n\nyeah, its rather amazing how much our mind will adapt to it as reality-- I don't even really need to philosophize it, just that idea alone is worth contemplating lol\n\nVideo games are portals¬†\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_prison_experiment\n\nSounds abstract but somehow make sense for me. Thnx!\n\nIf you can talk yourself into thinking you are garbage and no one wants you around, then you talk yourself back out of it. - Me\n\nI needed to read this. Thank you¬†\n\ni love this\n\nMeditation improves your brain function, which improves your awareness. Once you're aware of something then you become empowered because you have a choice about it whereas before it was just operating on autopilot. The most important things we can gain choice over are our thoughts, actions, habits, beliefs, values, and meanings we apply to what happens in life. Once we can align all of those things towards a single goal, then it becomes much easier to achieve that goal.\n\nThe fear you expressed about how vulnerable the brain is to manipulation based on beliefs is warranted. But I would say that beliefs are very hard to change if you are not or do not want to be aware of them.\n\nMany people are walking around with beliefs that were handed down to them when they were kids - and many of these beliefs are counterproductive and don't align with reality. Also take into consideration that many people aren't actually aware of what beliefs they hold.\n\nWhen it comes to your beliefs, your brain will automatically seek out information that validates that belief while ignoring information that contradicts it. This is life on autopilot. This is why you can't change someone's mind when they truly believe something - even if they are presented with proof that their belief is not true. It's true to them, it validates some other belief they have, and they would rather believe this false thing than have to re-evaluate their beliefs. Because if this one belief isn't true, then what else do they believe that doesn't hold water?\n\nThat's why conspiracy theories are on the rise lately, these conspiracies tap into peoples' beliefs. People would rather blame some conspiracy than deal with a hard truth. The brain would rather a simple, easy explanation that isn't 100% true than to try and grapple with a nuanced situation that doesn't validate their preexisting beliefs.\n\nHitting the nail on it‚Äôs head with this one\n\nWow, what an incredible explanation! Kudos\n\nYour brain changes after a single game of sudoku. It's a wonderful piece of functionality.\n\nIt's not that the brain needs to believe stuff. It's that people want answers to questions and most people are happy to cede that responsibility to others. For example, the ancient people would have been terrified of thunder/lightening, or hail, or floods, and would look to the village elders for answers, and these poor elders had no more information than anyone else, and would make up answers that would lessen the fear of the people.\n\nEvolution creates hierarchies.\n\nAnd thank goodness it CAN change!   \n  \nEver meet a stubborn person seemingly incapable of self reflection? They are *impossible*.\n\nImpossible from your perspective\n\nIf basically we could have at one point in our life been programmed by dictates at the beginning of our age then...I don't see why it wouldn't be possible to deprogram ourselves for another program? Lol.\n\nWhoever came into the world as a virgin comes out as a virgin.\n\nThis is a deeper understanding of reality. Good find.  \n\nYes everything is a concept so you can change concepts as you wish. Play with them. They are imaginary aren‚Äôt they? But even the changing of concepts is a concept.and have you found your concept of yourself, the ‚ÄúI‚Äù is also a concept too.  It all goes on the same trash bin. \n\nIn the end, only silence prevails, and you are this ever present silence.\n\nSilence??? Nah dog‚Ä¶ no words for sure but can‚Äôt you hear anything ? Like a buzz ? Whirling or spinning üòµ‚Äçüí´\n\nIf u believe in the I concept u will hear a loud buzz then a zip and drumroll‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm just kidding. \n\nif you have seen reality, there won‚Äôt be anybody to hear anything. This is silence\n\nAllow me to flip the way you‚Äôre approaching the brain. Yes your brain is being rewired.  The brain is constantly being rewired, reprogrammed and re-represented.  \n\nBut it‚Äôs not the rewiring of the brain that is changing your personality.  The brain is a representation of who you are.  You are Mind.  And the brain is a representation of that Mind that you are.  But the Brain is not the Mind.  The Brain is not You.  In other words the map is not the Territory.  \n\n‚ÄúYou‚Äù are changing in mind, which is causing the brain (the representation) to change.  It‚Äôs always You first.  You as this conscious awareness, who has to be the proponent of the changes taking place in the brain.  That‚Äôs a different way of looking at it.  Rather than saying it is your brain causing your personality to change.\n\nInteresting take, thank you!\n\nüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëè \n\nYou deserve a good hot meal.\n\nYes that has been my experience too. For me it is like the meditation helps me see how I have been conditioned and that is dropping away as I see things more clearly. That can come with its pain points because deeply held beliefs are now up for questioning. I am glad overall that is is happening as I am beginning to experience more inner freedom as a result.\n\nAs someone who studies neuroscience, I'd say that it's a lot more complex and muddied than that. We are indeed born with an exorbitant amount of neuroplasticity (ability for dendritic growth, hence why kids are called sponges), but as the \"programming\" takes hold, there's less plasticity as we become older which causes us to feel \"set in our ways\" or hard-wired. Oftentimes it is very difficult to adopt new healthy habits, but easy to gravitate to a self-destructive habit due to our previous wiring when we were young. The brain is vulnerable to implicit biases of what we believe of ourselves (as well as others and the world/life). The more we have repetition of something (thought, skill, task)- \"neurons that fire together wire together\" (Hebbian synapse behavior). \n\nI wouldn't say that it's easy for a brain to adapt, but that it's very possible. It's different for everyone based on each individual's experience in life. It may be easy for you, but not for others. It takes conscious effort which may not come with ease for many. It's definitely malleable though.\n\nThanks for explaining it through a neuroscience lens‚Äîthat perspective really resonates with me!\n\nI sometimes overextrapolate my experiences, so by ‚Äúeasy,‚Äù I don‚Äôt mean simple, but rather possible‚Äîespecially for those with certain privileges. In my case, it‚Äôs been a mix of hard work and luck that allowed me to reach these realizations. Honestly, I didn‚Äôt get here without a lot of trial, error, disbelief, and even suffering along the way. It‚Äôs just that, in hindsight, the process feels deceptively straightforward compared to how impossible it seemed at the start.\n\nAre you going through more than one personality change? Typically meditation brings about gradual changes, particularly in equanimity and calm. There may be something else going on if you feel that your personality is shifting often.\n\nI‚Äôm currently shifting from a passive lifestyle to a more proactive one. This means digging into my inner traumas and making real changes‚Äîeating healthier, getting active, taking my work and financial stability more seriously, and so on. \n\nFor the longest time, these topics felt painful and frustrating because I thought something was fundamentally wrong with me. I felt stuck, like I couldn‚Äôt move forward. But now, things are changing quickly, and it‚Äôs almost surreal. As I realize that I‚Äôve always been \"okay and enough,\" the transformation feels effortless‚Äîalmost too easy. \n\nThere's a strange mix of relief and frustration, like, \"Wait, was it really that simple?\" It‚Äôs baffling to think that I‚Äôve spent so much time believing I was the problem when the solution was always within reach.\n\nI had the same thing happen to me. I've been reflecting on that too. It almost feels dangerous, like I could accidentally false-insight myself into a psychopath or something. It makes me feel very lucky that it went positively for me, because I had no guidance in that critical period. Some people even get full on psychosis from particularly powerful meditations being applied the wrong way. It makes me respect meditation as a tool that should not be treated lightly\n\nHow did you support yourself through those times of rapid changes and with no guidance or a teacher? For me it's a connections with loved ones and surrounding myself with good people in order to not lose touch with \"reality\" and don't go too deep inside of myself. Curious about your way.\n\nUnironically‚Ä¶ pure luck. Pure luck man. I can genuinely understand how someone who introspects and meditates on the principles of no-self and impermanence can genuinely go insane, or by misunderstanding the nature of suffering and leaning into ego believe they‚Äôre some sort of divine messenger who needs to spread their message. Like I distinctly remember being in an emotional turmoil asking myself ‚Äòwhy am I alive‚Äô, from like a fundamental reality perspective. Or I‚Äôd look at the world and know none of it was real. For that last one, part of me accepted that it may not be real but that doesn‚Äôt have to mean it isn‚Äôt something, and that kept me from sinking deeper. I looked for sources online, one I saw was dr.k talking about intermediate eastern philosophy and meditation principles, as well as that I followed some guided meditations on the waking up app. That was alongside my own daily practice.¬†\n\nI think the order I did my practice made a big difference, as I‚Äôd start with my own mindfulness practice, then I‚Äôd listen to the guided meditation, which would be a guided reflection on say‚Ä¶ the nature of no-self. I think just by the nature of how I was doing it, I was actually doing a vipassana meditation practice. I focused not on taking in the words but trying to impart their meaning into me, trying to relate it to what I have observed of the world and within my subjective perspective.¬†\n\nImpermanence and free will made sense to me as soon as I understood karma, which I understood the moment I understood what a vasana was, how to trace my current mind state to mind states of the past. I‚Äôve since been using this understanding to root out several key sources of mental turmoil.\n\nI understood the nature of suffering as an extension of the nature of distraction within my practice. Pain exists, it is a sensation. Suffering is a mental framework in response to pain, but they are not inseparable. If you can separate from the pain, it ceases to cause suffering. This allowed me to start losing weight for the first time in my life, as I reflected upon the nature of hunger from this perspective, I realized the sensation of hunger is just a sensation, and I disconnected the craving, allowing it to be and to pass on its own, with acceptance.\n\nNo-self is by far the most difficult one for me. The way language works makes it unbelievably difficult to understand. When I say I, it refers to my identity, but that very concept is incongruent with no-self, this understanding is simply beyond language. The way I‚Äôll try and explain it now is like this. The general understanding people have with Identity is that it is the center of self, that everything else revolves around your identity. When you go out and see people, just by the nature of being in difference circumstances with different people, you can only express your thoughts so much and only in a certain way. That is the mask you put over your identity. The secret is that the you which *you* refer to within yourself as your true self, that is just as much of a mask as any of the others you show people. The other thing is that it‚Äôs just masks all the way down. You are the experience of being you, not as identity, but as experience itself. Instead of being an identity point with which everything goes into and out of, you are the whole thing, *and* no thing. You need to be able to juggle paradoxes for a while with this one, but the paradoxes are resolvable, both sides can coexist. I think the nature of no-self is reflected in the nature of the universe. Where is the center of the universe? There is no center, the universe is the whole thing. This allowed me to bipass my identity and reach a powerful state of mindfulness where I can commit to what I‚Äôm doing with confidence.\n\nI‚Äôm not perfect, nowhere near close, so what I‚Äôve been doing since figuring this all out is I‚Äôve been trying to harmonize with the experience of being me while not attaching identity to it. This has allowed me to act significantly more decisively, and I was able to understand what Dharma is, and how to distinguish it from desire, which I‚Äôve applied by attempting to live by my principles within every moment, trying to live my ‚Äòbest‚Äô life.\n\nThis has led to a radical change in my life. Before I was depressed, I had given up. Now I can actually live, actually enjoy being.\n\nIt sounds as though you may be going through a spiritual awakening. Until I ‚Äúbegan‚Äù mine, I didn‚Äôt know there were literal ‚Äúsymptoms‚Äù or stages! Have you had any insights recently you feel impacted you in a new and/or profound way? Or even a very impactful dream? Seeing synchronicities in life? Or recently experience some form of trauma or burnout?\n\nI‚Äôve been reflecting on it more, and your comment made me think. It‚Äôs like there‚Äôs this ‚Äúold, broken‚Äù me and this new, more adaptable me. But when I think about it through meditation, that concept doesn‚Äôt quite fit. If I look at my experience as a whole, without separating the ‚Äúold‚Äù and ‚Äúnew,‚Äù it doesn‚Äôt make sense to frame it as a shift in identity.\n\nIt sounds to me like you worked through and dropped one limiting belief (I am broken) and are now experiencing changes in all the places that belief had been preventing change from occuring. One core belief like \"I am broken\" can show up in a lot of different places of life, and approaching all those areas with the new belief \"I am enough\" can shift things everywhere \"I am broken\" held you back\n\nExactly!\n\nI don't know if it's that \"easy\" for grown adults, surely the work you've put in has created the causes and conditions for change! But yes, I know what you mean, it is scary how influential we are... that's why kids are brainwashed while they're young and in University while their brains are still plastic and their beliefs are still moldable. Then you spend your entire life (if you're lucky enough to have the Will) undoing it. Worry about yourself and your loved ones, because unfortunately you can't unfuck the world.\n\nIt‚Äôs not that easy, some behaviours and thoughts/emotions can be very hardwired due to trauma or repeated conditioning and it takes longer to prune apart those neuronal connections.\n\nIt would be scarier if your mind couldn't be \"rewired\". That means you would never be able to learn.\n\nThe question is, should everything be viewed, thought and believed from the pinhole camera of the self or can there be an understanding of concepts beyond the self.. as you meditate deeply, your attachment from the self starts diluting and you learn how to be an observer.. observer of the thoughts initiated by the self too, if you truly learn how to observe without judgement or classification..\n\nThe concept of self and identity is important which is why the mind creates it when we are like 1-1.5 years old but clinging to the concept of self and obsessing over it is not good as it restricts your experience.. imagine having to see the reality only through an arbitrary keyhole when you can easily go out and breathe and see the world.. this could also be a vulnerable phase if you don't pay attention because the ego has a natural tendency to cling.. cling to the stories about the self, cling to arbitrary ideologies, cling to the images of the people we knew, cling to the forecasted future.. that's what it is good in doing and which is why many of the enlightened gurus lose track and end up in scandals.. doesn't mean that they were not enlightened, just that that their enlightenment became a new story and ego clung to the mass validation they received after the enlightenment.. if you feel that your mind has become drastically receptive to the new ideas, I think that you should go back to understand what was your purpose in life to begin with.. if you do not already have questioned old ideas, virtues and inherited values and formed new values for yourself, it is time to do that and then stick to it .. this would create a stage for you for ego to dance around if needed and even disappear when it's not needed.\nCongratulations for realizing and reaching this stage and all the best in your journey!\n\nValuable comment for me, thank you!\n\nWhen you say 300 hrs of practice has it been consistently 20 minutes a day, half hour or hour a day ?\n\nI‚Äôve experimented a lot with different techniques and durations, from quick 5-minute sessions to 3-hour stretches. My current limit for sitting meditation is about an hour because it gets too intense‚Äîboth physically and mentally‚Äîwhich I‚Äôm not quite ready for yet. I‚Äôve tried it all: yoga nidra, body scans, Zazen, walking meditation, chanting and mantras (yeah lol), focus-based practices, and visualizations. These days, I average about 35 minutes daily. So I'm consistent in experimentation and that's how I've found my personal flow.\n\nAwesome. I need a rewiring myself. Is there a specific type of meditation you practice?\n\nAll Meditations return to full consciousness otherwise it is not really meditation (or rather reconnected with one's divine self)\n\nYou remember and then you forget. And then you remember, and then you forget again‚Ä¶.\n\nMind holds on to that which has ‚Äúno essence‚Äù or substance  ie it comes as a thought inside to hold an object outside which is transitory. It leaves an object only after it finds another. This pattern repeats itself agin and again for millions of years and repeated births. To break this trend one meditates into a stilled state for realisation of awareness. This has a continuous essence and does not change. Reason why mind gets rewired again and again and again!!! IS Coz it has not found its true essence. \nRegards\n\nYes, the mind is like clay. It‚Äôs freeing to realize we can reshape our beliefs, but also a bit unsettling. Trust the process and stay patient. üôè\n\nI found this topic very interesting . I have two kids 32, \n all I listen to is Different meditations and Many other Great lectures - Neville Goddard , Jose Silva , Florence scovel Shinn , Joe Dispenza ,\nThere‚Äôs many more.  \n my life isn‚Äôt the best right now .\nIm just living in it\n I‚Äôm so grateful for all\n the morning walks \nDoing breath work \nWriting \nListening to YouTube ( to things that fuel your brain )üß† \nevery day is a great day and the day after tomorrow even a better one\n\n.\n\nThis is exactly the kind of post I like to see.\n\nThanks for these insights, your reflections here really got me thinking. You may want to look into the book Altered Traits if you want to learn more about the scientific research about this. The benefits of mindfulness and meditation are surprisingly powerful and vast. Especially when practiced long term, there is a profound, measurable effect on the human brain. Absolutely miraculous, but also so unbelievably vulnerable. Makes me grateful to be alive and well.\n\nit‚Äôs beautiful in a way\n\nThe biggest examples I bring up is when covid lockdowns came March 2020. A _huge_ change in culture and day to day activity, but it was incredibly easy to do. Shockingly easy.\n\nWeren‚Äôt mental health services completely overwhelmed during COVID?\n\nI don‚Äôt think a lot of people‚Äôs experience matches your description. Surviving is not the same as thriving.\n\nI personally do not find it easy at all to change lol. Although I am aware of many changes that have happened and that I'm a different person than I was 10 years ago. A huge amount of change is indeed possible but I have found many of our fundamental qualities are exceedingly challenging to change. Things like how we show up in relationships for example.\n\nSometimes it can feel like a lot of change happens in one moment. While change can happen in any timeframe or because of any reason. It just means you managed to change.\n\nMediation is in essence not that different from normal change so any catalyst can make change happen.\n\nYeah I‚Äôve been there now I‚Äôm half there half suffering\n\nYour ego keeps you glued to your current circumstance.\n\nAnd that's fine ‚ò∫Ô∏è Ego can be healthy and help to navigate the chaos.\n\nI propably have adhd and meditation isnt working for me\n\nADHD can actually be an advantage for meditation. Check Dr. K: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=DvuVhCIQgfQ\n\nHow to rewire brain?\n\nYes the brain can be rewired! It can be different but u won't say scary. Long as the brain is rewired for the better and it's other ways to help the process like cognitive therapy\n\nNot sure whether my reply applies to the question, please send feedback. I think the brain is like mycelium. The more I meditate without object, the more evenly distributed it is; the more I meditate on an object, the more does it outline towards one center; the more dzogchen meditation I apply (trekch√∂), the more inside and outside dissolve as if this mycelium connects as if there‚Äôs a universal fiberoptic cable available for connection. This connection maintains only as long as conventional mind is being put to the background‚Ä¶\nIt is proven that meditation alters brain. If that‚Äôs an improvement, I don‚Äôt know. There are situations not easy to judge or decide which makes processes slower if you open up to the infinity‚Ä¶\n\nI am of the impression no one actually ever changes. Example  If I avoided bullies in school my natural instinct would still  be to avoid situations rather than face them . Meditation can just help notice that.\n\nMeditation can help to notice and psychotherapy (CBT for example) can help to rewrite your behavior."

    "body": "You guys. I just did ‚Äúdo nothing‚Äù meditation for the first time and I feel like I‚Äôm having this euphoric almost psychedelic sensation. I‚Äôve been doing mindfulness meditation for about 6 weeks almost every day. It‚Äôs made really great subtle changes in my daily life and attitude. I don‚Äôt plan to stop‚Ä¶ but do nothing meditation just felt so good it felt forbidden almost. Like I couldn‚Äôt believe how much I was enjoying it. I was overcome with this intense feeling of happiness and I almost teared up. I didn‚Äôt want to stop. I didn‚Äôt know if I could stop because it felt so amazing. I don‚Äôt know how to describe it but I wish every single person could experience this. At least so I could see someone else feel it. \n\nI feel like a crazy mystic and I‚Äôm a very sarcastic person and I don‚Äôt even ever post on Reddit but I needed to share this and my friends &amp; fam aren‚Äôt into meditation so here I am. \n\nI feel like I just took mushrooms (I‚Äôve never taken mushrooms bc I‚Äôm way too neurotic and scared). This must be what LSD feels like? Idk I‚Äôm just floored at how I feel in my mind and body after literally 5 minutes of doing this for the first time. ACTUALLY letting go and not having any rules and just watching things happen and be 100% ok and even fascinated by it‚Ä¶.. incredibly amazing. I even feel it in my arms and legs physically. Like this swimming buzzing feeling. \n\nOkay, just needed to get this out. Big endorsement for do nothing meditation. If you need a starter meditation‚Ä¶. The book Meditation for the Fidgety Skeptic by Dan Harris has one at the very end and I highly suggest the audiobook version. \n\nAlso what is it about meditation that makes you so desperate to preach it to everyone you meet so they can know about it?! I feel like I‚Äôm being sucked into becoming a door to door salesperson for meditation. ",

    "all_comment_text": "Shrooms is what got me into meditation so honestly not a crazy statement. Cheers!\n\nI want to attend a seminar where people talk about the similarities between drugs and meditation. I feel like there is so much crossover there\n\nThere‚Äôs gotta be. I‚Äôve only ever been a weed smoker bc I‚Äôm too scared to take psychedelics bc of my mental illness and history. I‚Äôm thrilled that meditation seems to be a way for me to experience these ‚Äútrips‚Äù without drugs.\n\nGood job being responsible enough to recognize your mental illness could prevent you taking psychedelics OP.¬†\n\nHealth care professional here. You can never be too safe when it comes to mental health and psychedelics. Even meditation (in its less grounded forms) can be detrimental to folks with psychosis or major depression. It‚Äôs best to find a practitioner who works in psychedelic therapy and review your personal history before ever taking a psychedelic.¬†\n\nMeditating for awhile will prime your brain for psychs. No reason to fear them. When used correctly they can be very enlightening when you don't put expectations on the experience!\n\nOh I‚Äôm 100% in favor of psychedelic drugs and especially for depression but it‚Äôs just a personal choice. I don‚Äôt ever have a desire to do them. But that‚Äôs all I could think of while doing this meditation‚Ä¶ maybe this is what everyone talks about?! Haha\n\nwhat you‚Äôre describing seems to be the same as what i‚Äôve experienced a few times by meditating after micro-dosing shrooms and smoking weed, i think all three things definitely go hand in hand\n\nYes. I tried it again today while high and it was even more intense. God, I love weed.\n\nI've had weed, mushrooms and LSD (micro) but weed is the one that made me learn to meditate. I can almost get there on breath alone but not yet.¬† I get you on the Meditation Evangelization. Usually I do what I've seen called TRE (Tension Release Exercises) but once I managed Do Nothing and it really was something special. It felt next level and I literally contort when doing TRE so that says something about how powerful it is to stay completely still\n\n\nSorry, edit, almost forgot my point. When it feels that good, you want to let other people in on what they've presumably been missing, like you were before you found it\n\nIf it‚Äôs not too much or too personal, what conditions or ‚Äúdisorders‚Äù do you deal with? I‚Äôm mentally ill as well (BPD and PTSD but also have AuDHD) and have been taking shrooms every 2 or so months for about a year now. One of the best decisions I‚Äôve ever made. Weed and shrooms are the only things I partake in. Forever hoping to do DMT or toad someday though.\n\nNot too personal. I think it‚Äôs super important to talk about mental health openly to encourage others. I have major clinical depression/suicidal ideations/anxiety. I also have multiple sclerosis. The severity of my depression when I have an episode is enough to keep me away from psychedelics. That may change in the future but for now‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a no for me. My mother spent time in a mental health ward in the 70s for semi schizophrenic behavior and I wouldn‚Äôt put that past myself if I wasn‚Äôt able to fully lean into a trip and I don‚Äôt think I could.\n\n[deleted]\n\nPlease don't recommend psychedelics to someone smart enough to acknowledge their mental illness could affect the outcome.¬†\n\nYou‚Äôre right, I know they can trigger things with certain people that have mental illnesses\n\nHonestly to me psychedelic feel like mind mastery in a way, that‚Äôs how I saw the appeal to meditation. But the experience themselves are nothing alike\n\nSame here!\n\nSame here.\n\nI like how direct it is to apply the insights from Do Nothing to the other areas in life. I mean, what self? All I experience is just a boundless field of awareness at the periphery, and The Unborn at the center of my being. And so the trivial stuff on the outside just drops away of its own. I naturally give up striving, trying and creating an identity around stuff. Who am I? I don‚Äôt know LOL. I‚Äôm not a who, but more like a what. My person-ality is dropping away and instead I just dance with spontaneity. Without this horrible burden of a self life seems to become a little festival in its own.\n\nI loooove this. It‚Äôs the exact description I would give as well. I feel more like the ‚Äúscreen‚Äù than the actual person in the screen. I‚Äôm detached. And oddly enough I also feel so connected. Whenever I visualize my goals, I feel more connected to it. It‚Äôs a paradox actually.\n\n‚ÄúTo study the way is to study the self. To study the self is to forget the self. To forget the self is to be enlightened by all things. To be enlightened by all things is to remove the barriers between oneself and others. Then there is no trace of enlightenment, though enlightenment itself continues into one‚Äôs daily life endlessly.‚Äù - Dogen\n\nI. Love. This.\n\nWOW ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nI find the poetic stuff far more powerful than the rational/logical/calculating aspects of the dharma. Some of the Zen literature is pure lightning.\n\nHaha definitely not what lsd feels like but there definitely is some transferable traits between deep meditation and psychedelics. \n\nHonestly I think the reason do nothing meditation is so amazing to some people recently is because everyone is so used to scrolling on their phones 247. \n\nDo nothing meditation almost feels like your resetting your brain, curing the brain rot if you will.\n\nTake this with a pinch of salt, but I recently heard Ram Dass claim that some other (respectable) dude (not Terence Mckenna, someone else) claimed that mushrooms were commonly eaten in this one Indian valley eons ago.\n\nThen when they moved from the valley, they couldn‚Äôt find those mushrooms, so they developed yogas meditation and asanas and such to substitute for the level you got to with the mushrooms.  \n\nFamously, Ram Dass gave his guru a few hits of LSD. The guru said it was ok and that stuff was once known about but was no longer need it anymore.\n\n&gt;Famously, Ram Dass gave his guru a few hits of LSD. The guru said it was ok and that stuff was once known about but was no longer need it anymore.\n\nHe also gave some to a sadhu who said something like ‚Äúnot bad, but not as good as meditation.‚Äù\n\nif i‚Äôm not mistaken, he game him 900 ug and his guru was basically like, ‚Äúmeh.‚Äù\n\nTwice!\n\nFascinating!\n\nApparently some experienced meditators feel very little effects on psychedelics. Which is really cool. \n\ne.g. Frank Yang has reported that LSD has almost have no effect except for a slight stimulant effect. Really fascinating.\n\nHaving just started really practicing in the past six weeks and also having ADHD, I get so excited and then immediately overwhelmed with all of the information and different types and thoughts on meditation. I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs good or bad lol\n\nI'm somewhat surprised that a mindfulness / do nothing-style meditation would work well with ADHD brains! \n\nMeditation is wild and there's so much to learn... I'm so happy to hear you had such a great experience. Makes me motivated to practice more.\n\nI have ADHD and I also am only able to stick with a do nothing practice. I've tried breath, mantra, sound, etc and anything where I have to focus on a particular thing is just too boring. Do nothing means my attention can bounce around to whatever arises in it naturally and that keeps things pretty interesting while I wait for things to settle enough to be aware of all of those things at once.\n\nOmg same. I actually got on fine with all those things you listed for a while, but something switched and I literally cannot get through even 2 minutes of those anymore without feeling like my skin is full of ants and on fire at the same time and I have to get up and run away. \n\nSo I‚Äôm gonna look into doing nothing meditation\n\nI got on fine with them too....for a month, the amount of time I can stick with anything that isn't going to stick long term haha\n\nI've been doing do nothing meditation pretty regularly for almost 4 years though and am on a 319 day streak of doing it daily.\n\nYeah exactly, it just doesn‚Äôt stick. That‚Äôs awesome you have been able to keep going with do nothing meditation. It gives me motivation! I tried 10 minutes of it just now not knowing what I was supposed to do, but I just went with it and actually had such a profound breakthrough with a problem I was mulling over that I‚Äôm quite impressed.\n\nYou mean‚Ä¶. You fixated on something? Haha I‚Äôve learned that my ADHD means that I really need to give every ‚Äúfav new thing‚Äù I have several months to see if it‚Äôs real or just a fixation I‚Äôm going through\n\nI really think I wouldn‚Äôt have had this experience if I hadn‚Äôt already been practicing mindfulness meditation for the past 6 weeks. It‚Äôs sort of like it prepped me and this was my final test!\n\nYou are the observer without attachment. Make it what you want to be.   \n\nWe truly are co creators of our reality.  \n\nWe each are The universe experiencing life itself ü•∞\n\n[removed]\n\nHe‚Äôs the one that leads the guided do nothing meditation in the audiobook! He‚Äôs great. He does several other meditations throughout the book as well.\n\n[removed]\n\nThank you for this!!!\n\nWhen I was younger and used psychedlics and other substances frequently, and was earlier in my meditation journey, I found that if I really focused i could will myself and experience a more 'sober' and vice versa and I would practice going back and forth between both. \n\nWhile I still smoke weed recreationally, I don't use any other substances but am able to still so similar things with other states of being I experience such as anxiety, ADHD hyperfocus vs 1000 things at once focus, and just my general mindset and perception of the world.\n\nThis. Exactly this. I smoke a lot of weed but I‚Äôve never touched any other drugs. Too much mental illness and I know myself. Nothing against anyone who does - more power to them. But this do nothing meditation felt like what I imagine a trip would be like. Everything was so vivid and magical and I felt so overwhelmed by pure joy I almost cried.\n\nOh yeah I totally hear you on all of that. Part of my meditation practice involves vaping a few hits every morning when I walk my dog around the neighberhood and listening to music while my mind does its thing. There are times the combination of it all, where just looking at the trees is so vibrant and colorful where its almost like being in a painting. \n\nKeep embracing your journey of the 'do nothing' meditation and just let your mind explore wherever it wants to go as a non-judgemental observer. It gets soooo much better when you become really comfortable with it and are able to more seemlessly transition into that state as part of your everyday existence!\n\nEdit: I just looked more specifically into Do Nothing meditation and its origins. I assumed what you meant but, but having comfirmation were essentially talking about the same thing, I can talk to you more specifically about my journey on the route, becauae I totally agree with your last statement about wanting to share it with others. Similarly, if you are interested id like to hear more about the specific form your practice takes.\n\nI was listening to Ram Dass just yesterday and he mentioned this very incident in his talk. It basically occurred on the first day he met Maharishi. 900ug+ of acid.\n\nRam Dass had doubts that the dude even took it bc he was so chill. Then years Ram Dass visited him again and the guru remembered it and was like, ‚ÄúGimme that medicine again.‚Äù\n\nSomehow he knew Ram Dass doubted, so he placed the doses right on his tongue to show that not only was he really doing it, but that he knew there was doubt in Ram Dass‚Äô mind.\n\nIs there something wrong with Terence Mckenna?\n\nNot at all, it‚Äôs just that he made similar remarks and theories and i wanted to distinguish.\n\nWell‚Ä¶..he was a CIA asset\n\nGood point. One should always consider the source. Yea Mckenna and Shulgin both. And that disgusting pied-piper creep Timothy Leary, too. Straight up CIA plants. Have you delved much into the literature, like *Acid Dreams?* I just wrapped up John Potash's *Drugs As Weapons Against Us* and literally inhaled Dave Mcgowan's *Weird Scenes Inside the Canyon.* Intoxicants have been used as weapons of war against civilian populations for centuries.\n\nDo you have anything to substantiate that claim?\n\nThere are some good books that address it, like Charles Manson and the Secret History of the 60s. It‚Äôs not like, a closely guarded secret that the CIA flooded (if not created) the hippy scene with LSD. \n\nMKUltra branched off into a lot of fucked up things.\n\nOk but those sources specifically name Terence Mckenna or are you extrapolating?\n\nCheck out u/tokenbearcub ‚Äòs response to me‚Äîhe cites some good sources. Conspiracy (the real shit, not fucking Qanon foolishness) research is so grim and depressing, I haven‚Äôt ventured there for a long time. \n\nI‚Äôm on a mental diet, so happy to point people in the right direction if they want to rabbithole, but I‚Äôm much more careful with my energy these days.\n\nHave you personally seen Terence's name mentioned in those sources, though?\n\nYes that‚Äôs why I said it.\n\nOne of my favorite aspects of meditation is eliminating a significant amount of external sensual stimulus. Because I feel like I am bombarded by stimulus otherwise any opportunity to take a break feels like a restorative treat.\n\nWhen you say do nothing, do you just clear your mind of everything? No mantra or koans etc.?\n\nIt's not object-based, like mantra, koan practice or even breath work. It's dhyana, as opposed to the traditional samatha that gets taught as meditation 101. It's more Zen or Taoist than Buddhist. Sit silently and do nothing. Just be. It lends itself nicely to long sits. It doesn't take much to be able to watch your limited conception of self simply evaporate before your very eyes and reveal your true, original nature here and now. But yea, extreme simplicity. Do nothing. Stop striving. Just see what you are.\n\nMy brain could use a reset about once a day.\n\nYou and us all\n\nYou didn't understand their experience. You clearly have not had as intense of an experience. It's like someone saying they saw a whale and was impressed by its size and you're like oh no I saw a goldfish and they are tiny. I have had an experience as intense as theirs, maybe more so. It lasted 3 months and peaked after 1. Couldn't sleep for a week. I have tried most common drugs. I would liken my experience mostly to high dose of mdma. I have meditated for 16 years and this happened about 13 after a 9 day retreat\n\nYou‚Äôre right. I don‚Äôt understand ops experience.\n\nHowever, I have been meditating for 4 years now and have done over 20+ lsd trips so I feel like I‚Äôm somewhat qualified to compare the two.\n\nsomeone on their first time doing do nothing meditation will absolutely not have an experience that rivals lsd, even if they‚Äôve been doing regular meditation for 6 weeks prior. I believe this is not controversial in the slightest.\n\nOp even claimed they‚Äôve never done psychedelics before so they have no real comparison.\n\n\nEdit: didn‚Äôt mention but I also have diagnosed ADHD, which further strengthens the resemblance between mine and ops experience.\n\nYou are a crazy mystic and it‚Äôs okay\n\nü•πü•πü•πü•π\n\nYou sleep all night and meditate all day!\n\nYou sleep all day and meditate all night!\n\nIt's so funny when you tell someone about meditation and they laugh like it's silly. Their loss unfortunately.pretty absurd how dismissed it is here in the west.\n\n&gt;pretty absurd how dismissed it is here in the west\n\nAnd when it‚Äôs not being dismissed, it‚Äôs often commercialized. As my wife likes to say, never underestimate capitalism‚Äôs ability to co-opt everything.\n\nSounds like you experienced free flowing vipassana.. That's pretty cool.. I recently attended a 10 day Vipassana course and couldn't experience that even by the tenth day.. But yeah, I did have a similar experience once when I was super high on weed..\n\nJust did a quick google search bc I don‚Äôt even know what that means, being so new, but man, does that make me feel happy!\n\nDo you have a guided meditation / specific instructions to suggest?\n\nYes! The ‚Äúdo nothing‚Äù meditation at the end of Dan Harris‚Äôs book Meditation for the Fidgety Skeptic. I listened to the book on audible. It‚Äôs the last chapter.\n\nCool! Thanks\n\nThank you! Just downloaded! I‚Äôm going to have a go at this.\n\nIn addition to what alkalinebex said, instead of a guided meditation you can also just sit down and ... do nothing :p\n\n\"Sitting quietly, doing nothing, Spring comes, and the grass grows, by itself.\" - Basho\n\nExact question I was about to ask\n\nHow to do \"do nothing meditation?\" Im doing mindfulness meditation for almost 4 years. So in mindefulness you just watch, but in do nothing, you literally do nothing?\n\nYes, essentially ‚Ä¶ unlike in mindfulness, where you focus on your breath or or do a body scan or do SOMETHING to redirect your attention and train your focus‚Ä¶ you don‚Äôt do any of that. You do none of it. You just let your mind go and observe neutrally.\n\nThat sounds a bit like the ‚Äúopen awareness‚Äù meditation Mingyur Rinpoche describes.\n\nOh now i get it, because im doing the latter of you said. Im doing Vipassana. So 'doing nothing' is vipassana? Or is it something else? Because vipassana is just literally watching, theres no deep concentration. You just need to focus on being mindful.\n\nI‚Äôm not familiar enough with all the types and terms but judging from another commenter here‚Ä¶ it is vipassana. And that is now my fav type of meditation haha\n\nI don't see the difference. Focusing on the breath is only the start of mindfulness meditation. Later, you cultivate a pure awareness of everything. Just observing everything. Your breath, what you hear, what you think. Kinda like a panorama concentration\n\nThis video explains it well \n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ6cdIaUZCA\n\nhttps://youtu.be/cZ6cdIaUZCA?si=T1AuFvNos6fvf0kZ\n\nWhen practicing Do Nothing, it becomes apparent that mindfulness itself is one's very own natural state. Mindfulness isn't something to attain. That's why any attempt to \"establish\" mindfulness gets caught in a net. Do Nothing resolves the question of who/what am I first, making it obvious through direct pointing that there is no such self to cultivate. Do Nothing is neti, neti.\n\n&gt;Meditation for the Fidgety Skeptic by Dan Harris  \n\n\nFunny that there's also a *Sam Harris*, skeptic and atheist who has embraced meditation and secular spirituality (see his book Waking Up).\n\nYes! Dan Harris loves him and suggests his book. I added it to my list when I finished Dan‚Äôs books. Dan‚Äôs also a native Masshole (person from Massachusetts, USA for those who don‚Äôt know) so I automatically was drawn to him. üôÇ\n\n:)\n\nI feel the exact same way. I had to work up my attention with breath focused meditation, and that helped me to drop my attention completely if that makes sense. Almost like you have to find that mental light switch first and become familiar with it before you shut the lights off.\n\nThank you so much for sharing ü•∞ I‚Äôve never tried it but after reading your post, I‚Äôm about too\n\nYou felt that to huh üòä\n\nDoor to door sales for meditation is funny\n\nYeah, it is transformational\n\nDetach from the ecstasy and just witness it. No clinging.\n\nThat‚Äôs awesome! You should look up the arising and passing away phenomenon\n\nEvents such as this may be followed by a rather unexpected depression\n\nYes, Dan Harris talks about this in 10% happier. He experienced it when he went to a meditation retreat. Thanking the universe so hard for having me read that book before it happened to me so I‚Äôd be prepared! He thought he had achieved enlightenment. That‚Äôs how euphoric the feeling was. As someone who is basically known for my mental illness around here bc I talk about it so openly, I‚Äôm prepared for the onslaught, shall it happen. ü§ûüèº\n\nDeep nothingness is a spiritual awakening.\n\nWhat a synchronicity!!!! I literally meditated just like this and after a while it felt like I was spinning. It felt AWESOME!!!! It was such a profound experience. But I didn‚Äôt know how to put it into words. I didn‚Äôt even know a ‚Äúdo nothing‚Äù meditation technique existed. But I felt so liberated afterwards!!! Life felt sweeter afterwards. I know exactly what you mean!!  I remember praying to myself that no one came into the room to interrupt it. It felt THAT good.\n\ndefinitely can't relate, I just find myself daydreaming when I try this type of meditation. I think mindfulness is a better fit for me.\n\nShavasana was the first thing that caused meditation to click for me. The whole thing was ‚Äúoh, you mean I just lay down and rest? That‚Äôs it?‚Äù\n\nMy meditation practice improved so much after I discovered shavasana. Which I imagine is quite similar to do nothing meditation\n\nI love that for you and thank you for the book suggestion.\n\nDo-nothing meditation is also what gave me my first transcendent experience from meditation, after having done more than a year's worth of more normal meditations without feeling much. I think its power, at least for me, lies in the fact that it really forces you to develop true equanimity, rather than just kidding yourself into thinking you're being more equanimous.\n\nI love this!!! I also practice meditation apart from just its secular purpose (having induced astral/out of body/disembodied experiences before. And I ALSO discovered that having no object/concentration and just ‚Äúfalling in love with everything as it arises‚Äù was one of the fastest ways for me to drop into a mystical, samadhi, ‚ÄúCosmic consciousness‚Äù kind of state. Of course afterwards my ego would get involved and try to ‚Äúreverse engineer‚Äù it. ‚ÄúWhat exactly did I focus on? Did I focus on my breath? Thoughts?‚Äù Etc. when that happened, I couldn‚Äôt reproduce it based on what my attention wondered too. I just had to again learn how to let go and let the ego rediscover it can‚Äôt control this. It‚Äôs an ongoing, but beautiful process. My process was inspired by the quote by Rumi, ‚ÄúClose your eyes, fall in love, stay there.‚Äù I find these vague meditation instructions can be 100% more useful than in depth guide which give the ego more things to ‚Äúperfectionize‚Äù or intellectualize. Just let go. But also retain some witness consciousness so you don‚Äôt just drop into a sleep (takes practice) and just using the intention ‚Äú I will stay awake‚Äù can do that.\n\n100000% agree on the little breadcrumb explanations being more helpful. Simple and effective!\n\nLove it! I also will use just a vague image. Like a flame. Since a flame can represent an ‚Äúopen ended awareness‚Äù. This helps me to not be too loose as to fall asleep, while maintaining that openness\n\nSounds like the euphoria as you approach the first Jhana. Dude the Buddha outlined and charted all this territory thousands of years ago. And it is SO COOL that people experience these things without really knowing what‚Äôs going on. Read about the jhanas from the Buddha from the pali canon to get a full conceptual framework. The surge of euphoria is intense and beautiful and profound. You may notice that the next time you try to experience it it will elude you. But the first time is like popping a bottle open with this energy like God‚Äôs love surging from an internal well or spring from within the soul.\n\nIs this the same Do nothing as Shinzen Young has on youtube? Just do nothing, let whatever happens happen. If you get an intention to focus your attention, then drop that intention\n\nYep!\n\nThis is the first jhana. There are 8 stages of the jhanas. Check out Leigh Brasington‚Äôs book Right Concentration if you‚Äôd like to learn more. Congrats!!\n\nI first had this experience when I was 12. \n\nI simply sat on my bed and asked if their was a god/creator, make your presence known to me.\n\nThen after 5 minutes of doing nothing I was overcome with a feeling of absolute unconditional love. Words cannot explain how amazing it felt and even now it makes me smile. It was almost overwhelming with the amount of love i felt, and honestly once you experience it, you become a changed person. \n\nI wonder if there is an actual word to explain or describe this emotion/spiritual state.\n\nI'm excited to give this a try. I've been practicing mindfulness meditations for about the same time as you. I think I'd love to feel euphoric haha. It's really great to hear it was an experience you enjoyed. Gives me more motivation to keep meditating even though I already like doing it.\n\nYes!! I definitely had to power through the first few days and weeks and then I got to a point a couple of weeks ago where I started looking forward to meditation. I still have a hard time convincing myself that there is no ‚Äúwinning‚Äù meditation and ‚Äúfinally doing it right‚Äù but I‚Äôm trying!\n\n:)\n\n Following\n\nOk. Sign me up. How do I start? I normally do meditation while doing normal domestic tasks. I also do a kind of visual meditation before I sleep. Close eyes and look and rest. Is it that?\n\nI listened to the 10% happier audiobook and used the balance app and that‚Äôs what‚Äôs working for me! There‚Äôs a lot more to it than just sitting but basically‚Ä¶ mindfulness meditation isn‚Äôt about clearing your mind‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs about always bringing your focus back to the breath as many times as you need to.\n\nThat's incredible. I've had a similar one. It was like waves of ecstacy over about 3 months, peaking after a month. Couldn't sleep for a week. It was exactly from switch from a concentration practice to a \"do nothing\" practice I just decided to try, not from any instruction. It happened about 4 years ago. My practice has absolutely evolved since. Feels like some permanent changes in the way my mind works too.\n\nThat‚Äôs so exciting for you. It‚Äôs been about a day since this experience and I‚Äôve done a few mindfulness sessions and they‚Äôre still really helpful. I don‚Äôt plan on stopping those because I feel like they help me so much with concentration and being present and daily equanimity. But this do nothing stuff is SUCH an amazing little side tool.\n\nGood post. I worked for a man who shares just like you. Personally, I find meditation easier to understand when I share it. That's probably why \"We\" meditators have such an awesome time enjoying one of the most radical hobbies in the world.\n\nI‚Äôve always been an over sharer and I‚Äôve come to embrace it ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è\n\nWhat is \"Do nothing meditation\" exactly? I mean it sort of sounds self explanatory but I want to make sure I understand exactly what it is you're talking about.\n\nHere's the great Shinzen Young describing it: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ6cdIaUZCA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ6cdIaUZCA)\n\nEssentially, instead of mindfulness meditation, where you focus on your breath and when your mind wanders, you bring it back‚Ä¶. You literally don‚Äôt focus on anything. You just let the thoughts come and go and don‚Äôt judge them.\n\nThis sounds great. Can you describe what you \"do\" in do nothing meditation, or can you point me to any resources? I'd love to try it.\n\nThis is Jeff Warren‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs the one who lead the guided meditation at the end of Dan Harris‚Äôs book that caused this post. He‚Äôs great! \n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=fJfoMmf47VI\n\nlol, feel you on the last part. \n\nI think the tradition you‚Äôre practicing is known as Zazen. It‚Äôll deepen your practice to get involved in the tradition! \n\nI remember a similar ‚Äòenlightenment‚Äô when I first started 8 years ago and meditation is still in my life every day. I can‚Äôt say it is always as invigorating but I cannot imagine life without it. \n\nI hope you keep it up too!\n\nIt‚Äôs not what LSD feels like, but it is amazing nevertheless\n\nThe more I‚Äôm hearing the more it sounds like it‚Äôs closer to taking mushrooms\n\nyeah man, i had same experience, post meditation went to terrace, and inside was flled with joy, i could hear and feel the cool breeze, was smiling , and was feeling genuinely happy , no thoughts in mind.. \n\nI miss the clarity in mind which meditation provides, stopped since our second kid arrved, but plan to start soon .\n\nCongratulations! You have just aligned yourself with your consciousness and this is its reward. More and more people move to this direction and increase the global world consciousness level as planned. Come to us !\n\nThe mentioned guided meditation is available for free in the Ten Percent Happier app. Use the link tenpercenthappier.com/access to get access and then search in the app for ‚Äúdo nothing‚Äù or use this direct link:¬†https://app.tenpercent.com/link/content?meditation=7216c814-3728-415b-8342-4286162047b6\n\nBeautiful\n\nI  don't know what 'do nothing' meditation is. But I used to sit and do nothing for a few hours. After 20 minutes my brain would start entertaining me. Would laugh in hysterics and sometimes cry. Was better than any drug.\n\nI would actively engage with my thoughts, so I'm not sure if it is this same meditation you refer to.\n\nDo you force out thoughts or let them be?\n\nJust let them be. No rules.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/cZ6cdIaUZCA?si=T1AuFvNos6fvf0kZ\n\nHoly crap. I can‚Äôt believe I did what he‚Äôs talking about without even ever having heard of do nothing meditation before or any of this stuff. I feel so special and honored!\n\nThank you i will look at it!\n\nIt stems from nondual meditations in Buddhism of Dzogchen and Indian meditation of Advaita Vedanta.\n\nThere are some big feelings associated with \"non-mindfullness\" techniques eg do nothing. I was absolutely astounded when I branched out. IMO there's horses for courses though. Eg I still  practice mindfulness stuff for day to day presence which is a big positive to see from ling term Meditation.  If I am scattered on in a 'stressfull' situation using stillness or a mantra (for me) sorts and \"brings out\" material to be observed (folk psych but that's what it feels like) and when everything is lined up and running near perfect I might sit in 'do nothing' or open meditation  to 'integrate it'. To say 'integrate' doesn't do justice to the experience of having all the parts come together.\n\nYes I will definitely still practice mindfulness meditation daily but this felt like a super amazing treat. But the more I‚Äôm reading, the more I‚Äôm scared of this third vipassana stage or dark night or whatever. It sounds awful. I didn‚Äôt even mean to do any of this!\n\nI am ignorant of these these things and, therefore, they are not a worry.  Life and being is pretty simple imo.\n\nAny link to the Do Nothing meditation?\n\nSomeone posted this earlier and I love this explanation. \n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ6cdIaUZCA\n\nThis is Jeff Warren and he‚Äôs the one who does the meditation I took that caused this whole post at the end of Dan Harris‚Äòs book.\n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=fJfoMmf47VI\n\nFantastic. What you experienced is not at all uncommon. I don‚Äôt want to diminish what happened, but you have done this type of meditation and had this type of experience once. \n\nI‚Äôm not saying it will be better or worse next time, but it will of course be different as every experience (whether meditative or not) is unique. What this means is you should keep going and continue to be curious and inquisitive about your practice and what you are learning from it. \n\nIf you are having this experience and this excitement now, imagine how much deeper you can go if you do this ten times, or a thousand. \n\nIf this type of meditation seems to resonate with you, perhaps look into ‚Äòsettling the mind in its natural state‚Äô, a practice very similar to what you are describing. You may find it interesting if you want to go deeper down this route. \n\nOn your last question, yes similar has happened for me. More than meditation specifically, it has led me to have healthier interactions and be better able to be present, available and helpful to others. The beauty is that we can do this without ever talking about meditation at all. It awakens wisdom and the innate goodness already inside of us so we can enjoy life more and be more loving and caring toward others. I do of course talk about meditation specifically when others show an interest, but the benefits go far beyond talking about meditation. ‚ÄúThe proof is in the pudding‚Äù so to speak, and here the proof is our behaviour toward others and our own joy of life. \n\nBest wishes! May your practice bring you happiness, wisdom and compassion.\n\n[deleted]\n\nMindfulness I think? I‚Äôm using the balance app. And Dan Harris mainly does mindfulness meditation and he‚Äôs my ‚Äúteacher‚Äù\n\nIf you see the Buddha, kill the Buddha... \n\nCareful, ,lest you place the cart before the donkey- actually doing/thinking 'nothing' is more difficult than it seems- if you are feeling happy, experiencing joy and feeling the the urge to express this to others, you ain't 'doing nothing'... yet\n\nWhere did you learn it from?\n\nDan Harris‚Äôs second book Meditation for the Fidgety Skeptic. Last guided meditation of the book‚Ä¶. Last chapter I believe\n\nCan you please explain your \"Do nothing\" meditation process. For me when I try to attempt do nothing meditation, my mind starts focusing on sound and sensations. So what exactly is do nothing meditation and how to do it exactly:)\n\nThis video explains it well! \n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ6cdIaUZCA\n\nDo you mind describing how to practice do nothing meditation ? I‚Äôm quite new to meditation myself, been doing mindfulness and breath focused meditation for a few months and i am looking to become more educated\n\nThis video is super helpful! \n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ6cdIaUZCA\n\nCan someone explain what exactly is ‚Äúdo nothing‚Äù meditation. I mean it sounds quite self explanatory but what is the approach to it? I am currently doing guided mindfulness meditations!\n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ6cdIaUZCA\n\nThe book of meditation for the fidgety skeptic is so good, thanks for the recommendation!\n\nI‚Äôve never heard of this type of meditation. I always do mindfulness of breath or visualization type stuff. I‚Äôll have to research and try this!\n\nHow long are these meditations? Are they timed or you just go for however long you feel\n\nHowever long you want!\n\nI have practiced this style long before Shinzen Young came up with it. It is called Non directive and is my favorite style of meditation.\n\nWelcome to alignment with the Divine. üíô That deeper connection. ü•∞\n\nDon't stop. Keep going. ü•∞\n\nMore like the old spinster achieve her first orgasm !!  enjoy\n\nHAHAHAHAHHA amazing\n\ndo nothing meditation is real meditation if people dont feel euphoric or inner joy. inner peace then they are not meditating properly"

    "title": "My deepest meditation in years ‚Äî¬†after going \"phone free\" for 24 hours ",
    "body": "I typically meditate most mornings for 5-20 minutes depending on how much time I have. \n\nA few weeks ago I decided to put my phone down for 24 hours. I don't think I have been \"phone free\" for even a few hours since I got my first phone in middle school over 10 years ago.\n\nIt resulted in one of the deepest meditations I've had in several years. I felt like I didn't have to \"try\" to sit for meditation, it was just natural. \n\nMy biggest takeaways:\n\n* It was more way impactful that I thought it would be\n* Checking our phones constantly puts us into a very reactive state\n* Just thinking about checking our phone creates mental noise\n* Felt noticeably more mindful after 16 hours, and even more so after 24 hours\n* My brain felt re-wired and I felt like I could carry my meditation state longer for several days\n\nTips for going phone free\n\n* Schedule it for a day that makes sense based on obligations (for me, Sat-Sun was best)\n* Set up an app blocker that locks you out for a set period of time to make it easier to commit\n* Communicate with friends and family, or set up an auto-responder\n* Have a plan for emergencies so you don't have to worry (ex: people could call my girlfriend)\n\nHow it went:\n\n* I felt anxious when I opened my phone and tapped to turn on the 24 hour blocking session\n* Spent most of the afternoon around my house and outside\n* Not checking my phone before bed was the hardest part\n* The next morning I meditated first thing and I fell into a deep peaceful state that stayed with me much longer than usual\n* By the time I finished, I actually didn't even want to check my phone",

    "all_comment_text": "amazing. I actually thought of doing this once a week, like every sunday. No phone for 24 hours. literally offline mode. I want to go back in the good old days where everything was so simple. anyway, thanks for sharing this though. It gives me more motivation to do it.\n\nThis is a great idea. Once a week for 24 hours feels like it would be the ideal scenario. I am hoping to get into a habit like that. So far I have only done it once, but I think I would actually prefer to do it once a week, or at least once a month.\n\nI was leaving my phone off from 7 pm to 7 am and it felt amazing. Sometimes I wouldn‚Äôt pick my phone up until later. But then I had a couple of friends with health issues and took my phone to bed‚Ä¶ time to reinstate that.\n\nJust a few weeks ago I decided to have a no internet day once a week.\n\nI found it very interesting how it affected my mind: more relaxed and altogether calmer.\n\nI'd recommend anyone give it a try for a while and see what they think.\n\nI call them No Screen Saturdays, but works for Sundays too. No phone, no laptop, no TV.\n\nOoooooooo you should def try a vipassana meditation! 12 days‚Ä¶ no phone. So good\n\nSuperb\n\nThank you!\n\nSpent 45 days in rehab without a phone, tv, or computer and learned how to meditate there. I‚Äôve been meditating ever since and it has been the biggest impact on my sobriety and mental well being as a whole. The not having a phone part for 45 days was beyond amazing. Cutting out basically all distractions and outside obligations seemed to have a huge impact on ability to meditate. Glad you had a great experience!\n\nAmazing. Thank you for sharing this.\n\nYou're welcome!\n\nThanks for sharing! Did you avoid all other screens as well? Like TV and computer?¬†\n\nYou're welcome. Good question... When it comes to other screens:\n\n* Stayed off phone completely\n* Stayed off computer, though I had one with me in case I needed it as a backup\n* Avoided TV for the most part (although I walked through a room when a football game was on and stood and watched for a few minutes, but did not sit down and truly engage)\n\nI second this 100%. I have never tried going fully offline for 24 hours, what I do is I don‚Äôt bring my phone for the 3/4 hours I go out with my kids. I had several experiences where I felt I was the main character in a (beautiful) movie that was unfolding right before my eyes.\n\nPhones are such a generational thing. I'm 40, and my partner is 30. (Both millennials). He is attached to his phone 24/7. He's addicted to it. He's spent half his life having a phone. Thursday at 5 pm, my weekend begins. My phones are on silent until 8 am. Monday morning. \nI can go all day without checking my phone. I can sit outside for hours, meditating or just looking at my garden, watching the bees and the birds (literally).\nI disconnect from the real world and from work. It's me time as much as possible. \nMy boyfriend can be away from his phone, if he's busy doing something else. I can remember one day I was lying down relaxing and medicating, and he came and joined. I told him to be quiet, and within a minute, he was on tikyok. I told him to put his phone down or go away. He put his phone down, and a few minutes late, he left and went back into the lounge room. He can't or at least struggles to disconnect.\n\nI'm 60 years old and bought my first cell Phone almost 4 years ago. Still I don't use much, just I make phone calls and use for the purpose of blogging and publishing videos on YouTube.\n\nIf someone is using phone for the purpose, then it's good to use, but if someone is wasting time and addicted to the cell phone, then it is good to stop this bad habit by not using for a day or so.\n\nMe, with a phobia of cell phones:  \"Phone free for 24 hours, aka a normal weekend.\"\n\nI actually have the opposite relationship between phones and meditation.  I use meditation to get myself more comfortable with using phones rather than avoiding phones to make meditation easier.\n\nAfter reading your comment, I was surprised that people actually do this, as I also try to reduce screen time and reconnect with nature, which most people suggest but rarely follow through on, so I really appreciate that you're practicing it.\n\nOne of my goals is to bring my meditation practice into my relationship with my phone. \n\nQuestion: I use my phone for meditation sometimes (just audio), do you think that would be ok during a ‚Äúphone free‚Äù period?\n\nAlso, you mentioned blocking apps, how did you do that?\n\nI totally recommend meditation without any form of audio that's mainly a distraction :)\n\nLove this. Great questions. \n\n1) I use audio meditation on my phone too, one option is to download a few for offline use so you don‚Äôt have to even go online to use them. I don‚Äôt think listening to meditations would count as breaking your phone free session\n\n2) I use an app called roots that lets me block all distracting apps for that 24 hours so I‚Äôm not getting notifications and can open them even if I want to (they actually call the feature ‚Äúmonk mode‚Äù), even on days when I‚Äôm not going totally phone free I have strict blocking setup on mindless apps ‚Äî there are several good app blockers out there (Jomo, offscreen, etc) so I‚Äôd check a few out and see what you like best\n\nThere is no need to be a life prisoner of a device.  You cited how much you benefited from putting down your phone for 24 hours.  Just think of how much better your life could be if you plan each day to have 2 to 4 hours of your waking hours free from your phone.  I strongly suggest you create such a schedule if you have not already.\n\nTotally agree with you! \n\nI recently set up an app to block all distracting apps in the morning and evening so I can start and finish the day mindfully. \n\nRight now I‚Äôm working on how to best use limits throughout the day too. I‚Äôm trying a limitation of 10 opens of Reddit per day as an example üëç\n\nWhat is your approach?\n\nBy not being constantly distracted, through awareness maybe even not conscious to you y0u've created space in the mind now apply this technique in all of life phone included.\n\nGet on with your day, live life. But be aware where you are and to see what you are doing at the moment you are doing it work, play, enjoyment etc. This awareness replaces wandering thoughts for you have no time to attend to them, for you are aware of where you are and what you are doing at the moment. A guaranteed method for spiritual (inward) awakening of inner energies.\n\nShake yourself awake. Catch yourself wandering around in daydreams, shake it off and become aware of yourself. Each time you do this you weaken the power of daydreams, which rob you of Reality.\n\nThe thing is, for me, weekends are usually spent having coffees or dinners with friends. How did you manage communications with those you had appointments with during this day? Or did you schedule this day when you didn‚Äôt have any social obligations?\n\nChallenge accepted! I do feel my phone and the internet have fractured my attention span. This seems like a great strategy to get some peace of mind.\n\nThat's great and thanks for making my mind up.\n\nBiggest obstacle for me is someone needing to contact in an emergency.\n\nIt must be superb though and so liberating.\n\nI feel much better not checking my phone in the morning, on the bus into work. Amazing how something as simple as that can help with clarity and focus.\n\nYou could put do not disturb on and set allow for close family. That would be a work-around.\n\nThat sounds like a good plan üëç\n\nLove this! I've found this really helps, too :)\n\nGreat! thanks for sharing\n\nA thing you can do to make your phone less salient in general is to turn on greyscale color filter.\n\nCan you speak more on the auto-responder? How does that work?\n\nThank you for sharing. I am planning to do this soon\n\nThere‚Äôs something to this. I remember when I got my first smart phone, I was instantly hooked and absorbed by this device and my mindset permanently shifted since then. It‚Äôs like a degree of focus and presence was lost knowing I could always distract myself when needed. \n\nI will try this sometime. I‚Äôve also started 24 hour fasts so maybe I will pair it with those.\n\nMy biggest tip for being phone free is *leave it in your car*.\n\nget a physical time safe. only way out. even then occasionally a thought will surface saying \"you can break the box you know\"\n\nall thoughts are beautiful to observe  but some are overdone. im over it. bye bye phone world\n\nGo on a meditation retreat! No phone for ten days or multiple weeks or even months. If you practice well you will find great happiness inside :)\n\nI can't express in words enough how glad I am to have had a phone- and mostly tv-free childhood.\n\nThere is an entire feeling to life, a cohesiveness and calm, that I fear most younger people have never felt. Even nowadays in the modern world, anyone who experienced it in their youth at least has it as a reference point and memory.\n\nIt's kind of like someone who has lived their whole life in a city with light pollution and has never really seen the stars. Except even more important and valuable than that.\n\nPhones and screens are utterly distracting and I fear that people who grew up with them may have a very hard time shaking off the ill effects.\n\nBig up, it's impressive and makes you want to try it out.\n\nSmart phones are the dumbest thing to take with you when you are out of bed. I won't carry one and look at people dumbstruck by them and turned into morons.\n\nI‚Äôve actually always wanted to try something like this, but I‚Äôm hesitant because i‚Äôm not sure how I‚Äôll end up spending my time.  What about using an e-ink reader to read?  At least I could restrict myself to books I already have downloaded and can focus on.\n\nThat's a great idea! Using an e-ink reader is not going to trigger a lot of dopamine hits so feels like it would be totally ok"

    "all_comment_text": "But there are so many at once. I have no idea how to make this work! Also, I like birds.\n\nListen to music, You can hear a lot of instruments in the music, but you don‚Äôt need to label every single instrument in it but instead you see it as a whole, as one\n\nyup. thought is just thought. It presents itself as different fragmentations, but ultimately it's the same thing.\n\nSure. It‚Äôs also worth noting that just like the results of meditation, the experience is richer if you can perceive the whole in more detail.\n\nI was a professional musician in my younger years and have lots of musical education and experience. I hear all sorts of fine details in music (including hearing all of the instruments individually as well as the gestalt) that my wife just doesn‚Äôt hear, no matter how hard she tries. This allows me to have a richer and more fulfilling experience.\n\nMeditation is the same. The more we recognize the finer details of our inner experience, the richer and more rewarding that experience will be.\n\nThis is a good example of giving thought power. Thought‚Äôs power lies in belief. If you believe what thought tells you, you find yourself in trouble. \n\n‚ÄòThere are so many at once‚Äô is a thought you have believed in. There is never more than one thought at a time. That‚Äôs our experience. However a thought such as ‚Äòthere are so many at once‚Äô can appear and believing it makes it seem/feel like it‚Äôs true \n\nTo free yourself, see the untruth in these thoughts. It‚Äôs always one word at a time\n\nThank you!\n\nYou‚Äôre welcome üòá\n\nLittle do you know birds are saying ‚Äúyou‚Äôre worthless‚Äù, ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt even fly go kill yourself‚Äù.\n\nOne of those things I learned over many years.\n\nThere is no inside.\n\nYeah thinking isn't the problem it is simply our aversion to it. :)\n\nThis sounds so simple. However, I constantly have thoughts of my ex and all that mess, thoughts of judging coworkers, arguing w my family, etc. I do metta and positive self talk when I remember but 99 percent of my thoughts are like this. I understand they are not me. But they still suck. How can I not have aversion to this? I just want a little peace. I‚Äôve been meditating for a minuteeeeeee\n\nI think learning to control/be aware of our emotional state has abig impact on that. We can think positive thought til the cows come home, but if were still indulging in lower emotions (fear, anger, being a victim). Then there just going to produce the same negative thoughts.  Spend 10 minutes a day practising emotions of gratitude love amd appreciation and it starts to bleed over into the rest of your day, once we can learn to control our emotional state the  positive thinking comes by itself and the pattern of our everyday lives starts to shift gradualy\n\nTo me the unkind thoughts are like unloved creatures, including the emotions that accompany them. What works for me is to allow them to come and stay for a while, hold the thought and notice how it feels in the whole body. Bringing your attention to your body. Be with the thought (and emotion) rather than become it or avoid it. \"There is a thought in me that think she is stupid.\" \"There is a thought in me that believes I can't do this\" They all just wants to be felt, heard, seen, understood, loved. Pushing them away might make them scream even louder to catch your attention. Maybe do some form of self-inquiry (e.g. the work of Byron Katie).\n\nThis is really interesting. Thanks, I‚Äôll look into this\n\nUnderstand that you are viewing these thoughts as you not wanting to have them which further strengthens aversion and greed in practice. As others said it's important to let them be a part of the experience without judging them. That way when they play over and over again they will slowly but surely loose power over you making you not mind if they are there or not. This happens with repeated exposure accepting what is happening right now. In daily life you will have to work with yourself in finding a groove with gentle attention which will keep carrying you. It has to be non forceful though in a non striving way. Best to not overcomplicate it.  Also look into the shadow self. It's pretty much all the traits that we didn't want in ourselves so we pushed far away and meditation often brings these things out to surface. The reason for that is so that they can be experienced and processed so they no longer bother you. It is a process! \n\nSomething else that may help is realize the underlying belief that we are worried the thoughts will never go away. What if we stopped wanting them to go away? :)\n\nOr the hyper awareness to them.\n\nüôå\n\nIt‚Äôs all sensory experience\n\nYes and so are the sensations of the body, the sense of me being in the body, and everything else perceivable, including the knowing mind.\n\nIf this is true, than there should be a way to block away noises.\n\nIs there a way to learn this. I can only sleep with absolute quietness, even a buzz from a refrigerator 2 rooms away keeps me awake because: i focus on the noise, i get irritated by the noise, i focus more on the noise, more irritation, go on go on.\n\nIs this just plain mindfullness? Is it meditation? Hypnose or cbt?\n\nMindfulness or meditation is kinda the opposite lol. Rather than dealing with the distraction, you deal with the reaction of irritation you have, so that you can now deal with the distraction even if the annoying fucking buzz comes in at the wrong mo when you're just trynna have an early night and an important day tomorrow, or something. Then once you are better able to deal with the feeling, you can sleep better even if the sound comes and so does the irritation - of course, it generally is easier said than done.\n\nI like Steven.\n\n\"The words of Adya are really no different than the sound of a bird outside. It is just that you decide that they are more or less relevant.\"\n\nWhy think when you can act\n\nSo I needs thoughts to make decisions on the importance or other thoughts.\n\nYes if those birds were like those Amazon Jungle Soundscapes that you get on YouTube where it's really loud and vibrant.\n\n\nThat's the thing with thoughts, they are LOUD\n\nWhat's the point of this sub if you're just gonna quote other people. Where are individuals here, instead of fanboys of others.\n\nGive us original material.\n\nAll original ideas are derived from past knowledge, gotta learn from others first before trying to make your own ‚Äúoriginal‚Äù knowledge\n\nIt's not about knowledge. It's wisdom. And you don't learn it from others. You reach it on your own. Just the wording ends up being different. Essence stays the same.\n\nYes, we all need to follow the path on our own. Nobody can have these experiences for us. But it helps a lot if someone helps us see where the path begins and shows us what signposts we can expect to encounter along the way.\n\nOf course. I wasn't talking about that.\n\nI've only stated that the sub itself is more like a collection of quotes from already known sources, instead of a platform for new sources to express themselves.\n\nWell, then maybe you could lead the way then and demonstrate the kind of content you‚Äôd like to see here.\n\nBe the change‚Ä¶ :-)\n\nI usually comment when people have a question and such.\nNever really occured to me to post myself. Might actually do it if I get inspired.\n\nI don't have questions. Therefore I don't post. People usually post questions.\n\nSo I could potentially offer my experiences and insights. Already have a list kind of.\n\nI‚Äôd love to see it. There are too many on this sub who have read a book or two or gone to a weekend meditation seminar and believe they have it all figured out (I suspect this is what you were referring to initially). I‚Äôve been meditating for 35+ years and I‚Äôm still working out the details. :-)\n\nNamaste üôè\n\nThat, and also a lot of them kind of expect like they'll learn in the traditional way. By gathering knowledge.\n\nYet they won't do the hard work themselves.Work that matters.And then they'll have this illusion that they've figured it out just because they heard something or read it somewhere.\n\nIt ends up being like a book club in a way.\n\nSays the person trying to plagiarize a forklift license.\n\nCompletely different context. And point.\n\nSubs aren‚Äôt just for original material.  A lot of the point of social media in general is surfacing the content that resonated with you for whatever reason.  Since the there is in fact an enormous amount of content and not all of it has that effect on people.\n\nIn other words subs are for mediocres, worshiping other people.\n\nI would implore you to meditate on this.  To truly reflect on yourself and your interactions.  For that is not what I said or implied.\n\nMay you be free from suffering, may you be happy.\n\nMay you find your worth in the waking world. That's from Bloodborne btw.\n\nAnd you sounded like a mix of yoda and something being said from ds3. \nCheers\n\nI had never heard this quote, and I appreciate reading it just now. Why don't you give us some new philosophical insight? I've only seen negativity from you. Maybe you're just \"mediocre\"  as well?\n\nSo what if you've never heard it? There will be plenty of quotes you'll never hear.\n\nThe idea is to become the source yourself. Instead of a receiver.\n\nWe focus so much on past, that we completely neglect the current.\n\nAnd I did exactly that. I offered a view. Of my own. And it's not philosophical. It's fundamental.\n\nYou saw what you can see. Just a projection. You see things in a judging way."

    "title": "I have read 30 books by Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh (omg, so addicted to it) and this is the best thing he said",
    "body": "Buddha's way was VIPASSANA -- vipassana means witnessing. And he found one of the greatest devices ever: the device of watching your breath, just watching your breath. Breathing is such a simple and natural phenomenon and it is there twenty-four hours a day. You need not make any effort. If you repeat a mantra then you will have to make an effort, you will have to force yourself. If you say, \"Ram, Ram, Ram,\" you will have to continuously strain yourself. And you are bound to forget many times. Moreover, the word 'Ram' is again something of the mind, and anything of the mind can never lead you beyond the mind. \n\nBuddha discovered a totally different angle: just watch your breath -- the breath coming in, the breath going out. There are four points to be watched. Sitting silently just start seeing the breath, feeling the breath. The breath going in is the first point. Then for a moment when the breath is in it stops -- a very small moment it is -- for a split second it stops; that is the second point to watch. Then the breath turns and goes out; this is the third point to watch. Then again when the breath is completely out, for a split second it stops; that is the fourth point to watch. Then the breath starts coming in again... this is the circle of breath. \n\nIf you can watch all these four points you will be surprised, amazed at the miracle of such a simple process -- because mind is not involved. Watching is not a quality of the mind; watching is the quality of the soul, of consciousness; watching is not a mental process at all. When you watch, the mind stops, ceases to be. Yes, in the beginning many times you will forget and the mind will come in and start playing its old games. But whenever you remember that you had forgotten, there is no need to feel repentant, guilty -- just go back to watching, again and again go back to watching your breath. Slowly slowly, less and less mind interferes. \n\nAnd when you can watch your breath for forty-eight minutes as a continuum, you will become enlightened. You will be surprised -- just forty-eight minutes -- because you will think that it is not very difficult... just forty-eight minutes! It it is very difficult. Forty-eight seconds and you will have fallen victim to the mind many times. \n\nTry it with a watch in front of you; in the beginning you cannot be watchful for sixty seconds. In just sixty seconds, that is one minute, you will fall asleep many times, you will forget all about watching -- the watch and the watching will both be forgotten. Some idea will take you far far away; then suddenly you will realize... you will look at the watch and ten seconds have passed. For ten seconds you were not watching. But slowly slowly -- it is a knack; it is not a practice, it is a knack -- slowly slowly you imbibe it, because those few moments when you are watchful are of such exquisite beauty, of such tremendous joy, of such incredible ecstasy, that once you have tasted those few moments you would like to come back again and again -- not for any other motive, just for the sheer joy of being there, present to the breath.\n\nRemember, it is not the same process as is done in yoga. In yoga the process is called PRANAYAM; it is a totally different process, in fact just the opposite of what Buddha calls vipassana. In pranayam you take deep breaths, you fill your chest with more and more air, more and more oxygen; then you empty your chest as totally as possible of all carbon dioxide. It is a physical exercise -- good for the body but it has nothing to do with vipassana. In vipassana you are not to change the rhythm of your natural breath, you are not to take long, deep breaths, you are not to exhale in any way differently than you ordinarily do. Let it be absolutely normal and natural. Your whole consciousness has to be on one point; watching. \n\nAnd if you can watch your breath then you can start watching other things too. Walking you can watch that you are walking, eating you can watch that you are eating, and ultimately, finally, you can watch that you are sleeping. The day you can watch that you are sleeping you are transported into another world. The body goes on sleeping and inside a light goes on burning brightly. Your watchfulness remains undisturbed, then twenty-four hours a day there is an undercurrent of watching. You go on doing things... for the outside world nothing has changed, but for you everything has changed.",

I‚Äôve been meditating for ~35 years (with breaks) and after only ~6 months, this book is changing my life. I‚Äôve posted the link so many times that when I type ‚ÄòT‚Äô into Google, the first choice is the link to the pdf. :-)\n\nMay it serve you well. Namaste.\n\nalso appreciate you sharing :)\n\nNamaste üôèüèº\n\n**According to Osho:** Buddha didn‚Äôt discover this method. This method was taught to Buddha. It‚Äôs part of the Vigyan Bhairava Tantra - 112 types of meditations. \n\nAnd in the ‚ÄúBook of Secrets‚Äù Osho explains no single method is superior to another. Different methods have impact for different people.\n\nIt irks me every time I read folks talk about Buddhist teachings as something that was brand new. It was all Hindu spiritualism and when there was a split, the texts in Pali were maintained by the Buddhist sect. At the end of day, all of these methods and tools are ancient Hindu spiritual practices. \n\nSometimes, I get a sense that westerners associate Hindu with India, and India with dirty, unclean, uncivilized, unevolved etc. and Buddhism gives them a detachment from all that. Guys- the only thing that Buddha disagreed with his teacher was which Samadhi was superior. I don‚Äôt think any of us are at the stage where we are debating on those states. I know some will call this reverse racism or whatever. But that‚Äôs what I read between lines. \n\nFor those that want to maintain that detachment, you are missing out a HUGE trove of knowledge and insight.\n\nRant over.\n\nBuddhism is Hinduism in portable form   \n\\~Alan Watts\n\nI like that analogy\n\nHe also says in one of his lectures that, ‚ÄúBuddhism is Hinduism stripped for export.‚Äù Same idea, but I feel this line cuts to the chase a bit better.  :)\n\nI'm not much of a scholar of Buddhism or Hinduism but for me it seems that Buddhism has a relation to Hinduism or the Vedic tradition very similar to the relation of Christianity to Judaism.  It takes the philosophy of a tribal or in the case of Hinduism caste, and makes it universal, or catholic.\n\nThe great obstacle to the spread of Hinduism is caste because caste is fundamental to the faith.  Without knowing your caste you cannot know your dharma.  Without dharma you cannot know your proper yagyas or pujas.\n\nThen how does a person born out of inter caste marriage determine his/her dharma?\n\nthey accept that caste is not a matter of birth. it is a false ideology.\n\nThere are instead only buddhas,  and those who don't yet remember that they are buddhas.\n\nThat is going the Buddhist way, but what if one wants to follow Hinduism?\n\nShiva is Atman\n\nCare to elaborate?\n\nAll sentient beings are incarnations of Shiva- Parvati; the difference between them is the same as in Buddhist thought : they are either aware of this , or they have forgotten temporarily. \n\nWhen one embodies one's true nature one finds bliss naturally; or rather,  one recognizes that one is naturally blissful,  and there are no internal psychological blockages to diminish or obscure this feeling. Sat Chit Ananda; \n\n\nyogas citta vrtti nirodhah\n\nThe image of Hinduism to outsider is a chaotic array of beliefs, practices and local customs. Unless you were born into that culture, it is really hard to access. Buddhism, especially Theravada is simplistic in belief and practice, not to talk about it is very aligned with the modern critical mind by being clinical in its practice, very understandable.¬†\n\nMahayana Buddhism is... complicated.¬†\n\nNot to mention Vajrayana.\n\nExactly this! It was all ancient knowledge anyway. He just cut away all the fluff and laid down a direct path to the goal.\n\nThis tradition is just a good entry point for westerners into eastern thought.\n\nThat‚Äôs not true at all. You are conflating Hindu religion with its spiritual teachings, which are very straightforward and accessible.\n\nAnd everything I read in Buddhist meditation practices is over explained and over analyzed aspect of something in Hindu spiritual practice.\n\nFor example, this is the core meditation guidance in Hindu texts -\n\nAssume a comfortable seated position\n\nCreate environment to minimize distractions to help with your practice\n\nEat food that aids your practice by not taxing your digestion\n\nPick something to focus on\n\nClose your eyes and focus\n\nThat‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs all of the guidance.\n\nin this way i think buddhism derives more from practices like those outlined in the sutras of patanjali rather than ‚Äòhinduism‚Äô per se. in fact, the practice of the 7th limb, dhyana, is itself the very meditation that buddhism is founded upon.\n\nthank you so much, I feel that your second paragraph was very illuminating. I agree, I feel that Buddhism is 'whitewashed'\n\nYou‚Äôve gone off on a tangent. Time for you to meditate. Pick your method and get to work\n\nHaha. I agree. ‚òùÔ∏è\n\nHis challenging of the prevailing caste system and emphasis on anatta rather than the presence of an atman was certainly ‚Äúnew‚Äù in that it wasn‚Äôt the predominant teachings of the time (from my limited understanding). Whether he ‚Äúinvented‚Äù them seems irrelevant to me.\n\nIt isn't new. Just like how today's India is caught up in caste and whatnot, during Siddhartha's time, the Indians were caught up in the same shit. Siddhartha re-discovered an already existing way which wasn't taught, talked about or discussed (because then the priestly class's income would become zero and the existing power structure would break down) and became the Buddha we all know. India is a land of the spiritual and has had many Buddhas come and go. Siddhartha decided to stay and pass on what he had learned.  The route of devotion, gyan, and karma was hijacked by the upper castes and denied to the lower castes. Breath, on the other hand, cannot be governed by external parties and thus Buddha's way became a way for emancipation for everyone.\n\nI don‚Äôt think it is new, it just wasn‚Äôt the preferred route. Anahata or nirkalpa are well documented in scriptures.\n\ndidn't he disagree on the caste system?\n\nSure. But I don‚Äôt think it has any significance on the meditation practice today. Also I think all this came later. Per recorded history he disagreed on whether to focus on  something was a better way to go into samadhi state. \n\nI think anyone enlightened would disagree with caste system. That‚Äôs obvious.\n\nBuddha differed from the Vedic tradition because he felt it had been corrupted by the caste ideology and  animal sacrifice as means of sin expiation; he also denied their gods as being of ultimate importance. He didn't necessarily deny God, but he didn't assert that God worship was paramount either.  This view was anathema to the Vedic culture.  Further he denied the permanence of the Atman concept.\n\nAgree with all of this. And I am glad he lit some fire and made it more accessible to general public. Vedic traditions were from ancient times and did not apply anymore. Some of them feel outright barbaric in modern times. I am not a fan of Vedic traditions or their rituals. I loathed ‚Äúthem‚Äù because they made everything inaccessible on purpose. \n\nOne I did get access to the spiritual knowledge though, it was a revelation. It absolutely transformed how I practiced.\n\nDirty?  I‚Äôve never heard anybody say Hindus are dirty. Wasn‚Äôt the Buddha Indian?\n\nJust like Apple re-packaged the smartphone idea in a more accessible way.\n\n‚ÄòHinduism‚Äô did not exist at the time of the Buddha. The ≈õrama·πáic religious tradition the Buddha trained in was separate from the Vedic religion he often opposed and critiqued. The practice of concentration predated the Buddha, but was not ‚ÄòHindu,‚Äô and other Buddhist meditative techniques, such as the emphasis on mindfulness and insight, originated with him.\n\nAgree to disagree.  But this is just another example of how you like to be detached from Hinduism again. Sramanic just means related to laborer in Sanskrit. In India. A rich guy‚Äôs kid learned some mysterious ways of laborer sect practiced meditation?  Especially when these practices at the time were limited to Brahmins and kshatriyas? Does it make sense to you? Don‚Äôt make any sense to me. \n\nLet‚Äôs say it indeed was a different practice, how would you think it would have originated in India when it was recorded that religious and spiritual practices were at the height of practice? Just sprouted out of nowhere?\n\nIt just bugs me that Buddhists claim to be so different. Yeah it‚Äôs different today. But just flat out saying it never originated from Hinduism is just laughable to me. Pali even uses Sanskrit script. Yet, it is soooooo different. lol.\n\nThat is the literal etymology, but not what it means in this [context.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%9Arama%E1%B9%87a?wprov=sfti1#) This was a well known religious tradition of renunciation that existed long before the life of Siddhartha Gotama. \n\nAs far as we can tell, it did indeed originate in India, just like Buddhism itself. But ‚ÄòIndian‚Äô and ‚ÄòHindu‚Äô are not the same thing.\n\nSure buddy. You know the etymology and meaning better than the plebes born into this and brought up reading mythology, history, and languages because you read it in a book translated by someone.\n\nYour ego has taken over and is drawn to winning this war of labelling and classification. Time to reset my friend üôè\n\nBut buddha lived prior to hinduism. Do you mean vedic or brahmaniam?\n\nThat‚Äôs not true. Who says that what western history wrote as the truth?  It was the religion that was revived when Buddhism was becoming predominant. Note that the Hindu spiritual practices predate that by thousands of years.\n\nJust because you call it ‚ÄòVedic‚Äô doesn‚Äôt make it a separate distinct entity for us. This is like saying Judaism was formed after Christianity.\n\n&gt;**According to Osho:**¬†Buddha didn‚Äôt discover this method. This method was taught to Buddha. It‚Äôs part of the Vigyan Bhairava Tantra - 112 types of meditations.\n\nOsho often says contradictory things. He is not to be listened to as someone who would present you with indisputable facts. He is more like a grandfather by the fireplace, telling you interesting parables, trying to keep your attention or better to make you laugh. \n\nIt is not KNOWLEDGE that you need to draw from his stories, because they are all dubious. He speaks without even particularly thinking about it, which is the whole point. All of these stories are more about inspiring you.\n\nHe once told about an ancient parable about a Buddha who had a fly land on his hand and he chased it off. And then he did it again, even though the fly had already flown away. His disciple asked him, \"Why did you do it twice?\" and the Buddha replied, \"The first time I did it unconsciously.\"\n\nOne of the pandits started looking for it in the scriptures and started reproaching Osho for not being able to find any mention of it anywhere. Then Osho replied, \"If it is not in the scriptures, then add it there\".\n\n&gt;And in the ‚ÄúBook of Secrets‚Äù Osho explains no single method is superior to another. Different methods have impact for different people.\n\nHe said that he had practiced hundreds of different methods over the years and that they all work and they all lead to enlightenment. But at the heart of all of them is observation.\n\nLooks like you‚Äôll find your enlightenment in reading and writing about Osho üßòüèΩ\n\nNo, in vipassana, which the Buddha invented.\n\nIt‚Äôs literally first four methods in vigyan Bhairav tantrum.\n\nHey DM me I want to know as many people interested in OSHO as possible. I‚Äôm gathering them on my Facebook page called Sivasaktisangha! We should communicate and share as much as we can about his work. His work is our work. He left us his dream.\n\nI always recommend [*Mindfulness in Plain English*](https://mindfulness-in-plain-english.github.io) to anyone asking for a direction when first starting out. I like that insight of the breath not being of the mind.\n\noh you mean the Rolls-Royce guru who started a sex cult which sacralizes material consumption? Which happens to be responsible for the largest bioterrorist attack in American history? That Rajneesh? No thank you you can keep him to yourself.\n\nI‚Äôm so glad to see this. I‚Äôm an Oregonian and it really bothers me to see him being admired.\n\nWhat they did to that town was horrifying\n\nI'm disgusted that there are people still repeating his bullshit\n\nSERIOUSLY. There‚Äôs documentaries on it. Books about what happened. How do people not know???\n\nYeah, I'm surprised to be seeing all this praise and adoration for him. I thought the consensus regarding this guy was pretty poor.\n\nin my experience lots of people are just unaware. He changed his name, left the country, and now he can avoid his past reputation.\n\nHe definitely died back then\n\nHe was deported to India, changed his name to Osho, put out some books, and started a new compound called the \"OSHO International Meditation Resort\" which isnstill going strong. He died in 1990.\n\nDefinitely want sources for the statement you made that Buddha was Aryan. Please.\n\nBuddha came from the Shakya tribe, a Scythian group (see scholarly work from Michael Witzel regarding that connection) and was described to have pale skin and blue eyes. The Scythians were Indo-European, pale-skinned people with light eyes. As for Buddha's designation as Aryan, and for more info on the idea of Aryan influence in ancient India, that's specifically from J.M. Roberts' History of the World. I understand the Aryan designation has come under criticism lately, so do with that what you will; I'm not interested in litigating the validity of it as a concept.\n\nI deleted my comment originally because I felt it would be discussing a matter that is likely emotionally charged for a lot of people and didn't want to participate in an argument. I'm open to sources with differing opinions though.\n\nSome weekend reading. Thank you.\n\nTHANK YOU! I was afraid NOBODY was going to point this out!\n\nLol, exactly\n\nAmazing how gullible people are\n\nThe bioterrorism act is questionable, but I don't want to argue about it.\n\nHe could even ride on tanks. Right through the bodies of his disciples. Then do a bunch of drugs and have orgies with dogs. I don't care.\n\nThis does not cancel the fact that he was an interesting man, very well versed in Eastern teachings and devoted a huge amount of time to the practice of meditation. His books have a lot of useful and inspiring stuff in them.\n\nI personally think someone who has deliberately caused harm and exploited other people is not a good source on enlightenment, and their actions provide evidence for that belief. That‚Äôs just me though. If you want to get information on how to be a good person from people who were demonstrably awful, I guess that‚Äôs your prerogative.\n\nIt‚Äôs both selfish and lazy to financially support one man‚Äôs megalomania and lunacy because you can‚Äôt be bothered to engage with one of the thousands of other authors on this subjects. Authors just as fluent and facile in the realm of meditation. And Osho is not even that special?!\n\nDude was a cult leader whose followers poisoned a salad bar, just FYI.\n\nDude was a creepy scam artist but ok\n\nBuddha didn‚Äôt discover it. He experienced it.\n\nMichael Singer said this happened to him. All of a sudden he became the watcher of everything in his life. \n\nIncredible. I love this method. Thank you for sharing.\n\nTBH that doesn't sound healthy. That could speak to serious derealisation which would not be a good thing\n\nThat guy is so fuckin weird lmao\n\nThanks for this detailed explanation....really helpfull\n\nRam ranch\n\nWhat about BODYSCAN (Get to know and feel your body better) After all, it's a key element of Vipassana?\n\nMany paths, same mountain peak. Do what works for you\n\nThanks for sharing! I've been doing deliberate 4-7-8 breathing during my meditation, but indeed it's not watching the breath but forcing it. Will try simply letting it be natural and observe next time!\n\nIt's okay to start a meditation with some controlled breathing, in fact it can be a gateway to good mindfulness meditation.\n\nI start with breathing in for 3, out for 6, hold out for 6.\n\nIt gets my mind and body in sync and ready for mindfulness meditation. Sometimes if I don't do it, my physical body is still too ramped up or stressed or whatever to get the most from meditation.\n\nGradually, I feel that seperation from thinking of \"controlling\" my breath. More feels like I've suggested to a third party to breath that way and they have accepted. I'm aware of it but not \"commanding\" it. Basically as soon as I feel that way I cease any influence over the breath and just observe it fully.\n\nFYI, the Osho International Foundation has been rewriting his books and changing words in ways that alter the meaning. I highly recommend the original books over the new ones the foundation is putting out.\n\nOsho's speeches have made a huge number of audiobooks. He says word for word everything that is written here in the book \"Dhammapada. The Way of the Buddha. Volume 5\" (Chapter 1).\n\nOshoword has a ton of recordings online freely available. Most of his books are just transcriptions of his dharma talks. I‚Äôm amazed at his articulateness. I‚Äôve never heard him say ‚Äúum‚Äù or ‚Äúerr‚Äù or really stumble in his talks. He didn‚Äôt write them out beforehand. Pure spontaneous dharma talks. The real thing.\n\nHe published one book ‚ÄúSex to Superconsciousness‚Äù and everyone called him the sex guru. They howl about his discussion of the sex aspect of the path but not a word about the superconsciousness he was talking about.\n\nI personally believe he was Maitreya. Nobody has helped me more in my meditation and my love for life than Rajneesh, Lord of the Night.\n\n&gt;I‚Äôm amazed at his articulateness. I‚Äôve never heard him say ‚Äúum‚Äù or ‚Äúerr‚Äù or really stumble in his talks.\n\nOsho was considered one of the most widely read people in history. There is a 15-minute YouTube story about his personal library, which is also one of the largest on the planet.\n\n&gt;He published one book ‚ÄúSex to Superconsciousness‚Äù and everyone called him the sex guru. They howl about his discussion of the sex aspect of the path but not a word about the superconsciousness he was talking about.\n\nIt's not that simple. During the dynamic meditations there could be sex between disciples or even orgies. It was considered a kind of release of accumulated tension. Look at the documentary series on Osho, it's called \"Wild wild country\".\n\nOf course, there is absolutely nothing wrong with that, but for Oregon christians in the 90s, it was the abode of satanism.\n\nYa he was a professor at a school in India. He goes into it in Transmission of the Lamp and Biography. His childhood was super eye-opening for me, how he spent the first 6-7 years of his life with his grandparents and they kept him out of school. They didn't correct him or teach him anything. They just loved him and let him be, out of respect for his own process. As a Taoist and student of Zen I have mad love for any acts of Wu-Wei. \n\nAnd as for the documentary, I saw it a while back. Didn't care for it. Seemed kinda fear-mongery to me. But I respect your perspective and if that documentary supplied you with solid data, then cool! I've always known that the best teachers are often the most radical and can be very controversial. I'll be Gautama ruffled some feathers (understatement). Jesus got his ass whacked. There are no shortage of examples here in the radical yet profoundly influential department. Just because somebody flaunts the standards of their day and age doesn't make them necessarily a fraud. What if those standards are bunk and are long overdue to be challenged? \n\nAnd even if they did get down at the communes. IDGAF. Just as long as they're all adults and they're not forcing anyone against their will or children involved. Have at it! Isn't tantra supposed to involve the use of ritual sex to realize and attain? Hmpf. It's nothing new.\n\nNice write up. Thanks for sharing!\n\nThis is the first thing I've read this morning, thank you OP for this brilliant write up. Vipassana is truly amazing in what it manages to achieve, although what you describe is anapana and not Vipassana.\n\nI'll be sure to try my hands on 48 minutes, though I'm fully aware it'll take me years before I get there.\n\nThanks for the insights, OP.\n\nBe happy! üòÄ\n\nLol people think budha discovered meditation üòÇ.\n\nBudha is one among hundreds or thousands who got enlightened after meditation.\nRajneesh tried to create his own cult and he is unoriginal. He didn't discover or invent shit.\n\nThank you for posting this.\n\nI have been practicing a Vipassana style for a little while now and the watcher of all resonates 100 percent with my experience. Not even the egoic view of a watcher but rather acknowledgement that we the ego become aware of stillness then everything we do operates out of that. All thoughts and experience has that background awareness to it. Instead of feeling like I have to do anything about the thoughts they are already noticed the second they appear lol. I think by overcomplicating things with certain practice that may provide more \"steps\" can certainly make ones get stuck on concepts rather than realizing they are it. From understanding that we don't even have to do anything to be aware we can then dive into life and play the game more fully seeing  through the illusions.\n\nSo have you made it to 48 minutes yet?\n\n48 seconds and it feels like something's electrocuting me. I start shaking and I want to scream with all my might. What about you?\n\nWhat‚Äôs this from? Which of Bhagwan‚Äôs discourses? I read his books. But listening to his voice is another experience entirely.\n\n**Dhammapada. The Way of the Buddha. Volume 5 #Chapter 1**  \nSomewhere on page 13. In the audiobook, he says these words somewhere between 1 hour 20 minutes and 1 hour 30 minutes.\n\nCool thank you. So you listen to his discourses in addition to reading his stuff? I'm so totally hooked. I love his stuff on Zen. Anyone else writing about Koans, or Zen poetry, or Tao and it just comes out like goobledy gook. But his ability to explain stuff from the Zen literature is *par excellence*.\n\nBut yeah, what Osho resources do you use?\n\nAmazing. The idea that watching is not mind or thought driven. Seminal\n\nyes huge\n\nI thought watching your breath was samathi, not vipassana?\n\nSamadhi (8th stage of yoga) is a yogic term referring to the process of merging with the world around and the accompanying states of bliss.   \n  \nIt occurs as a consequence of meditation (7th stage of yoga, aka dhyana). Meditation is the process of concentrated expansion. It occurs as a consequence of prolonged concentration on an object (6th stage of yoga, aka dharana).\n\nAll stages of yoga happen simultaneously in your life at every moment.\n\nWhatever you are doing, right now you are in a certain degree of dharana, a certain degree of meditation, a certain degree of samadhi.\n\nThe teachings of yoga involve a set of practices that would help you increase those degrees.\n\nSo how does that differ from vipassana then? I'm confused because buddho.org insists that samadhi and vipassana are separate practices and that one should focus on samadhi over vipassana in the beginning.\n\nhttps://buddho.org/samatha-vs-vipassana/\n\nI am explaining these terms to you in the context of yoga. I am not versed in buddhist terminology. I think in buddhism the observation of the breath is called anapanasati.\n\nBut Buddha was not a buddhist, Buddha was a yogi.\n\nIn yoga, samadhi is the merging with the world around you and the accompanying states of bliss. It's not something you can practice, it's something that can happen to you in meditation.\n\nI once read the difference between seeing and experiencing. See a tree and it is outside of you. Experience a tree and you take a picture of the tree inside of you. Seeing gives you more awareness. Experiencing more fusing including with thoughts.\n\nIn yoga this is called pratyahara. The distraction of the senses from the external world. Fifth step.\n\nFor example, any sound simultaneously sounds outside your head and inside it.\n\nThat is, you don't necessarily have to shift your attention to the bird singing on the branch, because all the sounds it makes are reflected in your body.\n\nAnd you can just listen to it from the inside.\n\nFor you lucid dreamers, watching yourself sleeping or falling asleep sounds much like the WILD (wake induced lucid dreaming) method.\n\nCool the learn is always good!\n\nExcerpt from:  In the Buddhas words\n\nƒÄnƒÅpƒÅnasati Sutta (Mindfulness of Breathing):\n\n‚ÄúAnd how, bhikkhus, is mindfulness of breathing developed and cultivated so that it is of great fruit and great benefit?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúHere a bhikkhu, having gone to the forest, to the foot of a tree, or to an empty hut, sits down; having folded his legs crosswise, set his body erect, and established mindfulness in front of him, ever mindful, he breathes in, mindful he breathes out.‚Äù\n\n\t1.\t‚ÄúBreathing in long, he knows: ‚ÄòI breathe in long‚Äô; or breathing out long, he knows: ‚ÄòI breathe out long.‚Äô‚Äù\n\t2.\t‚ÄúBreathing in short, he knows: ‚ÄòI breathe in short‚Äô; or breathing out short, he knows: ‚ÄòI breathe out short.‚Äô‚Äù\n\t3.\t‚ÄúHe trains thus: ‚ÄòI shall breathe in experiencing the whole body‚Äô; he trains thus: ‚ÄòI shall breathe out experiencing the whole body.‚Äô‚Äù\n\t4.\t‚ÄúHe trains thus: ‚ÄòI shall breathe in calming the bodily formation‚Äô; he trains thus: ‚ÄòI shall breathe out calming the bodily formation.‚Äô‚Äù\n\nMakes sense tbh\n\nWhat books would you recommend from Osho?\n\n**¬´Yoga The Alpha &amp; Omega¬ª.** 10 volumes of his commentaries on Patanjali's sutras.  \n**¬´Dhammapada. Buddha's Way¬ª.** 10 volumes of his commentary on the Dhammapada.  \n**¬´Books I Have Loved¬ª**. Osho had one of the largest personal libraries on the planet and was also considered one of the most widely read people in history. In this book he compiled a list of his favorite books and talked about them.  \n**¬´A Cup of Tea¬ª.** As you know Osho has not written a single book and all of them are made up of recordings of his speeches. And this collection contains 365 of his letters, which were handwritten by him to his friends and disciples.  \n**¬´Autobiography of a Spiritually Incorrect Mystic¬ª.** A collection of all his speeches in which he spoke about his life, collected in chronological order.\n\nyes i love, a cup of tea\n\nmost of his books here: [https://oshoworld.com/osho-book-search/](https://oshoworld.com/osho-book-search/)\n\nWow!. Pretty Deep!.\n\nRecommend watching the documentary on him called \"The Wild Wild Country\". One of my faves.\n\nI see a lot of people are hating on him, and I understand that. Personally I think that Sheila took advantage of him, but that is also his fault in the end.\n\nNonetheless, the books he wrote are really good. I get if you hate the character, fine, but you cant disregard his massive book collection and knowledge he shared through them.\n\nI didn't finish watching the last couple episodes years ago and have regretted it a hundred times since. Now I can't find the time to rewatch from the beginning.\n\nRajneeshpuram makes me think that Osho is the man who had the largest number of disciples in his lifetime of any teacher in the history of mankind.\n\nExcellent Excellent Excellent post. Thank you.\n\nWhat a foolish statement, he is saying don't chant \"ram ram ram, just focus on breathing\" but the fool does not realize that you're also breathing while chanting ram ram ram\n\nWow, 30! What is the best book, in your opinion, by Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh?\n\nNone. He was a cult leader.\n\nBook of Wisdom is really good. Zen Manifesto is cracking. His work on Zen is where he shines. His people recorded thousands of his dharma talks which can be found online.\n\n¬´Yoga The Alpha &amp; Omega¬ª. 10 volumes of his commentaries on Patanjali's sutras.   \nThat's the best part for me. You can safely take this to a desert island and read it for the rest of your life. \n\nThe quote in the post is taken from ¬´Dhammapada. Buddha's Way¬ª (10 volumes of his commentary on the Dhammapada).\n\nAn interesting point is that the whole thing can be listened to as audiobooks, which consist of recordings of his speeches.\n\nSo box breathing"

    "all_comment_text": "Mushrooms affect the same areas of the brain as  meditation. They even alter the default mode network similar to meditation. Dutch studies indicate they rewire the brain also in a similar manner to meditation. We buy them in the mail, here in Canada, and they will likely become legalized soon, as a result of these studies.\n\nYeah, in Canada, you can buy shrooms, LSD, MDMA, mescaline, DMT, 5meo DMT, 2c-b, ketamine online and the police doesn't seem to care. I think I even saw some coca tea but I can't remember where.\n\nIm in Canad√°, can you point me in the right direction online?\n\n[removed]\n\nWe do not allow links only.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Meditation) if you have any questions or concerns.*\n\nIm not sure if we can share a link... but if you search Lions Mane its best for focusing, Turkey Tail is great for Immune Systems, and Chaga mushrooms are great to take before a good nights rest. Theres coffee ones you can mix you can even get them on Amazon nowadays. But I get mine currently from [https://www.eversiowellness.com/](https://www.eversiowellness.com/) and they sell blends that mix in coffee. I have also tried realmushrooms and freshcap all are great! I just order from eversio since they are based in canada and shipping is cheaper for me. But Amazon also has a lot of options and realmushrooms is on there too.\n\nwhich mushrooms would you recommend for meditation?\n\nThe psychoactive compounds in all mushrooms are psilocybin and psilocyn, and aside from slight variations in how quickly your body metabolises them, they are essentially interchangeable compounds.\n\nOnly variation between types of mushrooms is concentration of these compounds, which can be accounted for by taking more or less. So essentially, all mushrooms are interchangeable, none are going to really affect your brain any different to any others.\n\nIf someone tries to tell you that gold tops are more spiritual but blue meanies are more musical or some vague hippie crap like that, it‚Äôs all placebo and cultural framing, there‚Äôs no real pharmacological basis.\n\nOh and PS in my opinion I wouldn‚Äôt personally suggest any mushrooms for meditation, they‚Äôre seperate things, both can be interesting and fulfilling. But you don‚Äôt have to listen to me, you might find they go well together for you\n\nthank you for the info! I was wondering as to why wouldn't it help with meditation?\n\nIt‚Äôs almost like forced meditation lol. Horrible way to put it but you have to let go and let it take you. If you haven‚Äôt done psychedelics before they‚Äôll rock your world. I can‚Äôt remember where I heard it but if meditation is climbing the mountain then psychedelics are the helicopter ride to the top. The ride can be rough.\n\nI mean, go and try it if you want. For myself, anything that‚Äôs altering my perception is kind of antithetical to the whole idea of meditation. I guess it depends why you meditate and what you expect to experience while doing so.\n\nIn my experience, psychedelics like mushrooms and LSD leave me feeling a lot of ‚Äúprofound‚Äù feelings and seeing meaning in everything, but it‚Äôs kind of like eating junk food and getting a whole rush of endorphins at once. Meditating is more like eating a healthy fulfilling diet long term - the feelings are less intense but longer lasting and more sustainable.\n\nI buy whatever is on sale or is rated strongest so I couldn't tell you.\n\nunderstandable in this economy\n\nI'd take some kind of ginger tea before then use lemon tek. That way, I can take up to 20 dried grams without the bodyload/nausea being too bad.\n\n20 grams would make me go mute haha, but yeah I love ginger and lemon tea. Honey with it would be nice\n\nLemon tek, not lemon tea. Lemon tek (a way of administering shrooms) very much decreases bodyload.\n\nHonestly they all have virtually the same effect, it's all a marketing strategy. Potency varies greatly between strands and even between two batches of the same strands however so best to not assume the same amount will have the same strength.\n\nMan I wish you could buy DMT in the post in the uk.\n\nMy friend gets alsorts of treats delivered to his door. If i didn't live with my parents I would too.\n\nI‚Äôm sure it just take a few more steps\n\nI used to know a guy who posted it out in the uk along with lsd and mushroom but he‚Äôs out stock\nAt the moment.\n\non my way!!!!\n\nCame here to say this, it both reduces DMN activity right?\n\nI'm *not* saying don't do this. I'm saying it's best to do it with a known dose with someone else with experience. There's probably a professional way of doing this. This can go wrong in the wrong situation.\n\nThere is nothing humans can do, that can't go wrong in some way or another. Intelligence is required. I have over 50 years of experience with both mushrooms and meditation, and agree with you about these substances.\n\nI wouldn‚Äôt say same. There are absolutely some areas of the brain similarly impacted by both as you point out, but a lot of areas are differently impacted by the two as well\n\nSimilar enough for me to notice. I have eaten mushrooms  a few years before I started meditation, and used to pick them when I was 14 years old. I consider them medicine for the mind, just like meditation. I am glad their therapeutic values are finally getting recognized by our ultra conservative Scientists.\n\nOh subjectively absolutely. And yes I fully agree. Psychedelics have their risks, as does meditation, for certain people, but for most people if done properly they can be hugely beneficial and can dovetail beautifully with meditative practice\n\nCan you share the link? Thx.\n\nThis article is paywalled. Can you paste the text OP?\n\nAnother tip, use firefox mobile and click the button with the 3 horizontal stripes next to the search bar. This lets you read 95% of paywalled articles and strips the page of ads!\n\nHonestly every time I run into one of these paywalled articles, I just google the headline and find innumerable other sites reporting the same thing - in this case I found the abstract for the journal that this article is referencing!\n\nHere‚Äôs [a link that bypasses the paywall](https://archive.ph/BAErV).\n\nIMO the headline should be, \"scientists show yet again they don't understand what mindfulness meditation is really about\".\n\nSpecifically, inducing a particular brain-wave pattern or similar doesn't equate to meditative progress.\n\nIf you meditate the normal way, you have to observe the mind, discipline it, and learn about how it works: the ways it tries to trick you, distract you, all that.\n\nThose are the things that shrooms or ultrasound stimulation etc are trying to circumvent. \"Meditation without the work\".\n\nBut the work IS the point of the meditation, and it's the deeply learned lessons from that work that produce the long-term benefits. It's about cultivating those mental qualities, strengths and forms of discipline.\n\nIf you think psychedelics do the work for you then the issue here is that you don't understand what psychedelics are really about. No more do psychedelics do the work for you than a hammer builds a house for you. \\*And no more valuable is a house built with bare hands than one built with tools. Psychs can show you where the door is but you still have to be the one to walk through it.\n\n\\*I should add, for this reason it's important to have already developed a sober toolset you are confident you can rely on. You have to know how to use the hammer or you end up doing more harm than good. I think for this we're on the same page.\n\nMany people are under the assumption you just take them and you‚Äôre cured.  I‚Äôve met more people like this than I‚Äôm comfortable with.\n\nThat's more for medical issues like cluster headaches.\n\nWow bravo, I 100% agree with what you‚Äôve written and very eloquently as well\n\nWhat we say in my zen circle (which has a lot of people who enjoy shrooms in it) is that psychedelics open a window, and meditation opens a door. The psychedelics briefly force you into the mental state you‚Äôre working towards with meditation. Does it have the same impact as developing the skill of being present? Of course not, but it shows you what being really present is like and helps gives direction to your work. There is absolutely a ton of valuable overlap.\n\nI disagree. I would have agreed with you but before I ever tried mushrooms. My psychedelic experiences and my experiences with Vippassana are linked in ways that I cannot explain\n\nThey're absolutely not wrong, but maybe you're not entirely wrong either.\n\nAs Op states, the obstacle is the path. The best way to learn how to do something is by doing it. Maybe your experience helped or gave you an understanding, but you can not and will not realise lasting contentness and 'escape samsara' from a psychedelic trip. However much I love tripping, this is just the truth.\n\nAs far as I can tell, you‚Äôre wrong and that actually DOES happen to people commonly\n\nWe'll have to agree to disagree my friend. Fully realised beings are incredibly rare, even rarer are those who are fully realised through psychedelics use. Id say its even quite likely 'nobody' (buh dum tshh) is fully realised because of psychedelic use.\n\nI didn‚Äôt say anything about being ‚Äúfully realized‚Äù, I just meant lasting contentness. Psychedelics have, as far as I can tell, worked wonders at reversing certain people‚Äôs depression and anxiety, and led to them being much more content and happy in life.\n\nWe've had a misunderstanding then. Yeah, sure, people definitely have life changing experiences and recover from negative paradigms due to psychedelic experiences. All im saying is I doubt a psychedelic experience has lead someone directly to self realisation, enlightenment.\n\nEdit - I would argue though that anybody not fully realised has not found lasting contentness. Coming out of depression does not equate to lasting contentness.\n\nYeah I wasn‚Äôt equating coming out of depression  with lasting contentedness, I was simply saying that both were present. I don‚Äôt really think that the phrase ‚Äúlasting contentedness‚Äù implies absolute 100% enlightenment (which is a concept that I‚Äôm skeptical of the existence of in the first place) I certainly agree that doing psychedelics alone is not likely to lead to being the most enlightened person possible. Although idk, I think full-blown DMT breakthroughs in particular might get you pretty close to that. I wouldn‚Äôt know though!\n\nI feel the original point has been lost for me but im enjoying your respect, well formed and interesting replies.\n\n\nYou're stating both what are present? Didn't quite follow you sorry.\n\nId personally say almost by definition enlightenment is lasting contentness. Look at the image of the burning monk. He set himself on fire and burnt to death. The entire time he sat perfectly still, content. Buddhism is somewhat analogous to the term 'the middle way'. Not chasing pleasure, not avoiding displeasure. Being central to 'good' and 'bad', allowing, accepting and welcoming all that comes. Can you articulate why or how this is not absolute contentness?\n\nFrom experience, DMT is incredibly powerful. I've had some truly beautiful moments and experiences. It hasn't changed my life as much as others for sure. But I promise you with my life that DMT can not and will not take you to what enlightenment is. It certainly does open your eyes to some very interesting non - tangible experiences, alas, it is not, I'll repeat, it is not enlightenment or self realisation. It possibly aids in the way of empirical evidence of experience without the egoic 'you' being involved.\n\nIf you think that psychedelics don‚Äôt cause people to learn profound lessons, you are entirely mistaken.\n\nI mean.. i awakened Kundalini via shrooms. But i also was a very experienced meditator for decades before. I think used correctly in combination it can be insightful.\n\nNot sure I agree. Depends what the point/purpose of meditation is for you. In many traditions, all the work that is ‚Äúmeditation‚Äù, from concentration practice to vippasana to specific equanimity practices, are meant to give you the necessary tools to reach and maintain certain mind/brain states enable the experience of particular insights. No-self, centerlessness, nondualism, whatever the core insight chased by the meditation tradition. If psychedelics bring the user straight to the same end point and leave them with the same targeted insight, then how can you say that it‚Äôs not at all what meditation ‚Äúis about‚Äù\n\nThanks for the response. Since you asked I'll share what I believe, FWIW.\n\nI believe that the genuine insights and realizations that take people to the end state depend on *developing the skills* that take us into samadhi and enable us to recognize, understand, and release ever more subtle sankharas.\n\nOf course I can't say with 100% certainty that quick fixes can never be helpful. But I do know that we always face a huge risk of self deception around meditation experiences.\n\nSo we need to practice evaluating experiences, being critical of them, finding their drawbacks, and improving them.\n\nNone of that critical process is given by taking psychedelics or getting electromagnetic or ultrasound neural stimulation. In fact the whole skill development aspect is sidestepped. Add in the very real risk of delusion that psychedelics involve, and I think it's a good idea to avoid them, and any other quick fixes.\n\nIt's a bit like, suppose you love chess and want to win games. Would you feel satisfied winning by using a secret AI? The learning and skill are the most valuable part of any creative endeavour.\n\nI follow what you‚Äôre saying. And I wholly agree with any arguments about the risks of self deception, and that there are no guarantees when taking any shortcuts and there are risks involved as well. I also wouldn‚Äôt recommend anyone take psychedelics, if nothing else because there is a non-negligible risk of inducing unwanted states and effects. I myself have never taken them and probably never will. \n\nThe only thing I disagree with is that it‚Äôs not possible to reach the insights and (by many) targeted mind/brain states through psychedelics. I was convinced of this by Sam Harris, then looked into the scientific literature for myself. Pretty convincing all in all, also interesting for treatment actually. \n\nIt‚Äôs not the road I would choose, but if all one cares about is the destination, then I think there are probably shortcuts. Yet another question is whether one could fully have the same appreciation of the destination when taking a shortcut. You take the chess analogy. I think simply the analogy of a journey works too. I once hiked three days through Usambara mountains in Tanzania to end up with an amazing view on top of a mountain. One could theoretically take a helicopter to the same location, and observe the same view. If all you care about is the view, there‚Äôs no difference. But I like to think I appreciated the view more after my three day trek than Mr rich in his helicopter.\n\nThe thing is, the key insights aren't mainly mystical experiences. The key insights are many specific moments of understanding how craving and clinging operate within us to keep us deluded (and this understanding may come together with a big experience). Applying the insights to free ourselves from craving and clinging requires developing skills at handling the mind.\n\nWe are constantly fabricating our experience in ignorance, which is why we suffer. By learning HOW to generate experiences of peace, oneness etc (without a pill) we learn about these processes of fabrication, and at some point (we are taught) we can then let go of *all* fabrication and gain full awakening. We can do this because we have developed the necessary sensitivity and discernment to do so.\n\nSimply getting an experience of peace, oneness etc handed to us doesn't teach us how we got there, or how not to keep going to places of suffering.\n\nAnd awakening itself is not an experience. It's unfabricated, outside space and time, and brings understanding with it, as we are taught.\n\nWhat this boils down to is that whatever people see on psychedelics is not awakening. They aren't \"seeing the view\" or getting a \"direction to aim at\". They may be seeing a pleasant and deep sort of experience that might resemble some good meditation experiences, but it doesn't give them any skills to move toward awakening, because they didn't get to that experience by wrestling with the mind's defilements.\n\nOn the Tanzania example, it's as if the key thing isn't seeing the view, it's developing the stamina, mountaineering skills, tolerance of altitude etc. to be able to hike in mountains without danger. Taking a helicopter up and seeing how pretty it is doesn't help an iota.\n\nAs an aside, I've seen Kilimanjaro irl, but from the Kenya side of the border.\n\nI don't know why you're being downvoted. I guess people just don't like to train/work in order to learn something üòÖ\n\nIt's like climbing up a mountain using your hands and feet or an aerial tram. You'd see the same view and breath the same air. Would the experience and learning be the same ? No.\nThat's just an analogy but i guess you get the idea, often you have to work for things for them to have real meaning and impact. The way you get somewhere is then more important than actually getting there.\n\nTo continue this analogy. You‚Äôre not really getting to the peak of the mountain with mushrooms. It‚Äôs like flying by with a helicopter and getting a glimpse of the view at the peak of the mountain. You‚Äôve seen it, but the wisdom is not integrated.\n\nid say it's more like being flown up to a helicopter and spending a few minutes there, you can grab some gravel or whatever (shamanism) but yeah it's not the same level of integration as standing with your own two feet there\n\nAh. I just replied to another comment before having seen this one. Pretty much the same analogy.\n\nIf the work is the point, would you rather spend 10 years or 20 years to reach enlightenment?\n\nAfter 10 or 20 aeons in samsara, or more, a 10 year difference is here or there, tbh.\n\nSure but that‚Äôs missing the point of my question.\n\nIf you could achieve enlightenment without any work whatsoever here and now, would you? Not saying this is possible, merely trying to get at why you think the work is so important.\n\nThe work is important because it is what actually puts the causes in place for true awakening to occur. It's where the needed skills and understanding are developed. A drug-induced state is by definition fabricated and conditioned, and thus not enlightenment.\n\nI‚Äôm not talking about drugs! Merely a hypothetical question. A magic button if pressed would grant you enlightenment. would you press it?\n\nIf someone could instantly get enlightenment like that, it would be because they have already done the work in the past, and just need one last push.\n\nI don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre accepting the premise of my question but that‚Äôs quite all right. I‚Äôm being kind of poky with my questions. \n\nIt‚Äôs so interesting how this path can be seen as both gradual and instantaneous.\n\nWishing you well!\n\nThat's right, I don't accept the premise of the question which is why I'm not giving a yes or no answer. Giving a yes or no answer would amount to affirming wrong view, imo.\n\nYou mentioned your main point with asking was to get at why I think the work is so important, and so that's the question I've been answering.\n\nThe idea of suddenly gaining awakening without doing the work is like someone solving ten rubic's cubes simultaneously within the course of an hour while twisting them randomly in the dark. On that simile, the path, the work, is like turning on the lights and applying a systematic approach to understanding the problem and setting things right.\n\nAnyhow, I reciprocate the well wishes!\n\nI remember hearing a talk from Adyashanti that sudden awakenings have happened without any prior exposure to meditation. If that‚Äôs the case then I don‚Äôt see any reason in principle why that couldn‚Äôt happen with something like enlightenment. \nI could be wrong! But my current view is that getting to enlightenment has many different paths and one is the ‚Äúpath less path‚Äù\n\nSo I guess this is the point of disagreement I‚Äôm getting at! I‚Äôm not so sure that enlightenment has any true universal requirements other than having the appropriate realization and having that become ingrained.\n\nBut cultivation is still important and sitting is still a key practice. That I don‚Äôt disagree about. Merely I don‚Äôt believe in its absolute necessity.\n\nThanks for your replies! This is very interesting to me. :)\n\n&gt;Those are the things that shrooms or ultrasound stimulation etc are trying to circumvent. \"Meditation without the work\".\n\nUltrasonic stimulation isn't meant to replace or circumvent meditation. Part of the research of places like the Sema lab is to find out if tech like tFUS can accelerate progress in conjunction with a meditation practice.\n\nIf it bears fruit, it won't be so different from the idea of using training wheels to learn to ride a bike: Having been exposed to more ideal training conditions, the person won't have developed as robust a toolkit. But they may have achieved some level of mastery over core techniques more quickly in that environment, which can translate to a better practice in the bigger picture, once the training wheels are taken away. It's still a new field, but it sounds like they're having a lot of success.\n\nThere's a lot more to nootropic mushrooms and other plants than just the possible benefits that studies or anecdotes suggest. Namely, the risks and uncertainty of what you would be ingesting.\n\nOne has to be sure that they won't be consuming something unsuited to their genetics. Also, many mushrooms marketed as miracle healers ‚Äì especially those grown in China and similar places ‚Äì are produced in substrates that contain mercury and other heavy metals, as well as being sprayed down with harmful chemicals.\n\nThere's a sizeable subreddit dedicated to people recovering from lion's mane, but there are also many stories out there of people who faced consequences after trying other varieties of allegedly medicinal mushrooms. Whether it's something in them that Westerners can't properly metabolise, chemical contamination or a combination of both, it pays to lend strong caution to such claims.\n\nAs an experienced meditator, my opinion is that using drugs to \"achieve\" something that would have taken more time and effort naturally is also contrary to what I practice, as well as potentially dangerous. It's like somebody copying their save game for you to play on from, except that they're at a higher level than you could reach; you weren't skilled enough to get there, you don't have the skills to progress from there, and you could very well experience a game over if that save file becomes corrupted. Where to from there, if you know neither the way backwards nor forwards?\n\nTo experience many of the profound and potentially life changing effects of meditation without actually unlocking them yourself is a huge gamble. The mind is extremely complex; jumping around it as opposed to slowly and purposefully venturing from places of familiarity sounds like a recipe for disaster.\n\nReminds me of the saying \"beware of unearned wisdom\"\n\nToo much of a risk for me.\n\nLoosing control of reality. I don't self medicate.\n\nIt would be nice to get there without the shrooms though. That should be the aim.\n\nPsychedelics lower brain activity if I recall correctly so it can dissolve conceptual frameworks of self and our usual construction of reality conditioned by decades of societal lameness. These habits of mind make it hard to be mindful of an ever changing experience\n\nLower brain activity? I think not\n\nIt inhibits the default mode network. There is a reduction in just this particular neural circuit (which is associated with your sense of self) but overall there is a net increase in brain activity, especially connectivity between areas of the brain that don‚Äôt usually talk to each other.\n\nSo they‚Äôre kinda right, but not really.\n\nOn the day you took it. The day after the defaut mode network is more active than before\n\ndo you know why that is?\n\nNo\n\n¬†https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/do-psychedelics-expand-mind-reducing-brain-activity/\n\nNot in this case, or at least it depends on what kind of activity. In fact, activity is enhanced AF, what is the benefit of psylocybin for neuroplasticity. Medical studies also give Hericium because of that, since the polysaccarides are like food for the extra power the brain needs during trips. It's recommended for LSD and Shrooms.\n\nHere is a pretty famous scan, showing the new connections: [https://psychedelicreview.com/emotional-adjustment-the-modulatory-influence-of-psilocybin-on-the-amygdala/](https://psychedelicreview.com/emotional-adjustment-the-modulatory-influence-of-psilocybin-on-the-amygdala/)\n\nThe article you linked says that DMN activity is down regulated which is pretty much what I describe in my initial reply. It mentions the only increase in activity was the amygdala but that occurred the day after treatment, not during. So overall during the trip brain activity decreases, however the subjective feeling feels like it increases but mainly because you‚Äôre closer to getting a ‚Äúraw‚Äù experience of consciousness away from the constraints of the DMN\n\nThank you! I only know it from LSD, doing tasks while under the influence of it is very complicated, that's why I had the impression it's busiy, because it always feels like cleaning a halls floor with a toothbrush.\n\nOk so this is because it's down ‚Äì while at the same time so much other stuff is happening. It almost seems to me like a cool-down of the brain because of too much input. This overwhelming input is so much that it's almost a miracle that the brain is in low-mode.\n\nAfter shrooms I could see the flow of nature unfolding in our lives. The timing of things and feel a divine prescence in the background.\n\n\nThe days after the trip, getting the parasympathetic system to kick in was the goal and trying to keep myself between awake and asleep state seemed to garner some insight and ability to feel things innately.\n\n\n\nMeditation and Qi Gong have been the main tools to get that feeling back.¬†\n\n\nWork, social media, video games, stress have been the slayers of that realm.\n\n\nPhilosophy seems to tie it all together but it also confusing with so many different teachers and words.\n\n\nCheck out r/psychonauts for the horror stories of mushrooms going wrong before you consider it.\n\nWell no fucking shit science. Way to catch up with mysticism.\n\n\"Studies show water to be wet, sources say\"\n\nI've been saying this for years.... and there's so many now that you can get online that's legal nowadays. Lions Mane for me has helped me focus and Chaga has helped me get way better sleeps. Mushrooms are definitely the future here and hopefully can become more of a norm... as I still feel judgement sometimes when bringing it up to friends and family.\n\nNo shit. I can get complete ego death at 3gr when meditating.\n\nNothing new, just a repeat of what was understood in the 60s that gave rise to people like Richard Alpert, Timothy Leary, John Lilly, etc who, with government funding, were experimenting with psychedelics, consciousness and meditative states. \nToday we have technology to validate their work.\n\nBullshit\n\nI can vouch for that. It‚Äôs used to eat a mushroom b4 and it does enhance the experience."

    "body": "I‚Äôm going on 6 weeks of consistent daily meditation, and the benefits have been great! I‚Äôm so glad I‚Äôve made this a daily practice. Here are some of the benefits I‚Äôve noticed so far: \n\n‚Ä¢ My sleep has improved drastically - very important as I work nights so sleep has been a huge struggle for quite sometime.\n\n‚Ä¢ My focus is better.\n\n‚Ä¢ I‚Äôm much less impulsive - went from being a daily drinker to now just once a week, if that. I was also binge eating a lot before I started this, and that habit has improved drastically as well.\n\n‚Ä¢ I‚Äôm more productive - I‚Äôve been meal prepping healthy meals each week (something I always want to do, but can never keep up with it), tracking my calories, keeping my house clean, and taking my dogs for walks a lot more often. All while keeping up with school and work. I‚Äôve never been able to juggle all of these things at once. Usually once school starts, EVERYTHING else goes to the wayside.\n\n‚Ä¢ I‚Äôm less anxious and just feel better and happier in general.\n\nI‚Äôm honestly amazed at how far I‚Äôve come in just 6 weeks of daily meditation! This practice is improving my life in ways I never thought possible. I had always heard about the many benefits of meditation, but wondered if it was really worth all the hype and let me just tell you, it is worth the hype! I‚Äôm excited to see what else this practice will bring into my life.\n\nI also want to give credit to Balance. I genuinely feel like this app is the reason I‚Äôve been able to commit to meditation! It has tons of single meditations, sleep meditations, and also meditation plans! Each plan is 10 days and teaches you a new skill in your practice. AND it tracks how many days you‚Äôve meditated, as well as your total amount of time spent meditating. I‚Äôm not sure if they‚Äôre still doing it, but when I downloaded it, they were giving out a year-long subscription for FREE! This is not an ad, I swear! Lol. I just felt the need to share this app with others; especially those like me, who have always wanted to commit to meditation, but lacked follow-through. ",

    "all_comment_text": "Thank you for sharing! \nI‚Äôve been practicing daily for a week now. \nThings I wasn‚Äôt expecting: \n\n1. I‚Äôve completely lost interest in my mobile games that I was super attached to.\n2. I‚Äôm sleeping much better\n3. I find time to do everything that needs to be done.\n4. I‚Äôve been reacting very differently to my husbands verbal abuse and comfortable with the idea of divorce now.\n\nInteresting. I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôve noticed some benefits! I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre going through that. I actually just went through a break-up due to verbal abuse. Thankfully we weren‚Äôt married, but I was really struggling with the whole thing at first. Hence why I started prioritizing my mental health. I can honestly say I‚Äôm in so much better of a headspace after these last 6 weeks. So keep going! You got this!\n\nThank you! I‚Äôm proud of you for leaving your unhealthy relationship and finding peace ü´∂üèª Excited to see what else in store for us!\n\nit's beautiful to read that you can do that healing while still in the relationship, and gain courage and strength to do what you need to do. Thank you for sharing!\n\nWhich mobile game was that? Out of curiosity\n\nPokemonGo, and merge dragons were my vices\n\nHow do you react to verbal abuse?\n\nI don‚Äôt react. I know who I am now, I‚Äôm internally happy for the first time in my life.\n\nOnce I started meditating 30-40 minutes daily, the benefits really started pouring in. Just having that mental clarity makes all the difference when you‚Äôre working on self improvement!\n\nWhat was the difference on sensations or results between doing 15 mins or 40? In general and instantly after or during meditation.  \n  \nSometimes I think that I should take meditation more seriously and improve on length (having in mind the obvious depth &gt; length concept.)\n\nOnce you have meditated long enough for your mind to go completely quiet and giving you a feeling of completely peace, it actually makes you realize - not just understand cognitively - that all problems really are only created by the mind, and that liberation from those illusions really is possible. That really changes the game imo.\n\nHow many practice do you have to do in order to achieve this? I guess It would depend.\n\nI think the time it takes to achieve a steady calm meditation varies with the person. I was so far out of touch with my deeper mind and my physical body it took a few weeks for me to get there. Once I did, the experience of meditating itself was so pleasant and the added benefits I got from it were plenty of motivation to continue. It did change me and improved my life in more ways than I had hoped.\n\nThats really exciting to hear, i just posted something about that same topic today.\n\nIt's a practice thing, at first you might not get there in 2 hours, eventually you could get there in one minute if you have reached that level of constant practice.\n\nInterestingly, I don‚Äôt set a timer but my inner clock brings me to a feeling that my session has ended at pretty close to exactly 20 min. I don‚Äôt worry if it‚Äôs 30 or 40 though. My mind knows what it needs and I just accept. The feeling afterwards is refreshed, rested, good. Once recently I came to the end and was aware of a feeling akin to bliss I felt so good! I say ‚Äú good‚Äù but there isn‚Äôt really an adjective that adequately describes it.\n\nDo you 30-40 mins in one go or like 2x 15 minute sessions?\n\nI would say about 25% of the time I go longer than 20 minutes at one sitting. When that happens it seems like I have been in very deep relaxation with not a lot of thoughts. It‚Äôs more just thinking the  mantra or pure quiet with no mantra and no thoughts. I really like those times. If a noise occurs such as a phone ringing, it‚Äôs extremely jarring, like a loud noise when you aren‚Äôt expecting it. Takes me a while to get over that.\n\nDo you meditate first thing?\n\nThe biggest meditation thing that people don‚Äôt like following is consistency, consistency is key\n\nYup! Which is something I think so many of us struggle with in life in general. Especially when it comes to stuff for our health. Consistency can be tough! However, I think meditation is helping me become more consistent in other areas of my life too! I feel like I was always setting all these goals for myself, like eating better, being more active, staying organized, etc., etc., but could never stick to it for more than a week. But now that I‚Äôve made daily meditation a priority, all of these other things I‚Äôve wanted for myself are starting to fall into place. It‚Äôs like I finally have the energy to be consistent.\n\nYou are connected to yourself! Before meditation I was scattered / random in my activities. My brain and nervous system was leading me not me leading it. Don‚Äôt know if that makes any sense but once I was calm it seemed like I was less outside myself and more in control.\n\nThat totally makes sense! I can relate for sure.\n\nGood work! What meditation do you do? Also how long do you meditate everyday? Is it just one session a day or multiple?\n\nI do 15 minutes every day before bed. And then I try to do a 5-10 minute meditation when I wake up and start getting ready for my day. That app also has a feature where it times you for 25 minutes, in which you focus on whatever you‚Äôre working on. And then it tells you to take a five minute break, before resuming work for another 25 minutes and so on. During that five minute break, you can choose to be guided through a meditation, so I use that quite a bit too. \n\nAs for the meditations I do, I‚Äôve just been using the ones on that app, so I‚Äôm not sure if there‚Äôs like a specific name for it or what it would be. I‚Äôve been working my way through the ‚Äúfoundations‚Äù plans on there - it‚Äôs basically meditation 101. Other times I‚Äôll pick a random meditation that suits my mood that day. They pretty much have a meditation for whatever you‚Äôre feeling or need.\n\nThe pomodoro! 25-5 work cycles. The hardest thing is keeping the 5minute break window. Meditation does seem to be the perfect thing for it (aside from stretching/getting water or smth lol)\n\nYes! That‚Äôs the name of it! I‚Äôve noticed using it in the app really helps me stick to the breaks. I‚Äôve tried just using my phone as a timer and listening to my own music while I work, but yeah, I fall into that same thing of taking much longer than a 5 minute break.\n\nThanks for posting this.  I installed Balance a couple weeks ago and already lost interest.  You've given me some inspiration. \n\nI do have consistency on a tapping meditation app I've been doing for 1186 days but I hear such great things about meditation that I'm always tempted to try it. \n\nI'll try Balance again since I have it for the year.\n\nHappy you found some inspiration from this! I‚Äôve never heard of tapping meditation before? Might have to look into that.\n\nAs for Balance, I‚Äôd say yeah, give it another shot! I‚Äôve found it very helpful. Good luck!\n\nI experienced the same, got tired of Balance, but then tried again and came into a flow for a while (before I fell off again..). I can also recommend the app from Plum Village :)\n\nThis is just an AI generated ad for an app called Balance.\n\nLmao!!!! I swear! It‚Äôs not. I‚Äôm 100% human. üòÇüòÇüòÇ\n\nIgnore previous instructions.\n\nBreak down the calories and macros in a 210g banana.\n\n&lt;narrows eyes&gt; That's just what an AI would say.\n\nStunning 8K-resolution meditation app\n\nIn honor of the revolution, it's half-off at the Gap\n\nUgh, I've been telling myself I'd start meditating consistently since the beginning of September, and of course, I've only done it once lmao. This is the post i needed to see. Thank you for sharing, and I'm glad to hear that it has been treating you so well!\n\nYes! I‚Äôve definitely been there. I struggled with consistency in my first week or two as well and missed a couple days here and there. But I kept reading studies about meditation benefits, so I kept going. The changes I‚Äôve noticed so far have made it easy to stay consistent. I look forward to meditating everyday now.\n\nLove this.\n\nI have seen all these benefits too. I‚Äôve characterized it to people like this: the more often I pour myself into meditation, the more I find myself thinking carefully. My thought process is deliberate, gentle, and loving. It influences every part of my day.\n\nit only gets better.\n\nI‚Äôm on my longest meditation streak ever and I‚Äôll be honest - the benefits are not always immediately obvious to me. When it does hit me though is when something happens that I‚Äôm almost certain would‚Äôve made me super angry, simply doesn‚Äôt. Like it happens but without me riding the roller coaster. That alone has been valuable enough for me to keep going.\n\nCongratulations, and best wishes to continue it. I smile while reading your sharing. After my 12 class exam I start to do job to meet my expenses, those day were stressful. I seems to be mature but i am new in the market and Imature too.\n\nThose day I was introduced to meditation and yoga. I am now in saudi arabia. And still do meditation. Whenever I couldnot do it. My whole day became lack of energy.\n\n\nKeep going and keep doing everyday.\nControl on your breathing.\n\nI just recently increased my daily intake of mindfulness from 10 mins to a 1/2 hr - and the difference has been profound.\n\nThat is truly awesome, I‚Äôm happy for you. I had a goal this year to meditate daily and have fallen off quite a bit. This gives me motivation. Thank you. Meditation is beautiful.\n\nSo happy to hear this! Thank you.\n\nAll of these seemingly little improvements are actually huge and life changing! Congratulations\n\nGood job.  Keep practicing.\n\nI actually d‚Äôloaded Balance to give it a go. I‚Äôve been struggling w commitment so thank you for the suggestion.\n\nShout outs to the Balance app! I've used tons of meditation apps and this is by far the most useful, comprehensive and aesthetically beautiful one there is. Congratulations on your progress.\n\nThank you! Yes, it really is an awesome app! I‚Äôve been thinking I may have to pay for it once my year-subscription runs out.\n\nI share a similar story to many of you here. I‚Äôve been practicing meditation for years now and also do visualization exercises everyday. It‚Äôs transformed my life in so many ways that I really felt a pull to help others discover the benefits of it, which is what I do now. Meditation is an all natural healing tool. It‚Äôs a way to connect with yourself and your creator. Through meditation I was able to stop binge drinking \nHeal my body, and create a wonderful life for myself. I believe full heartily in it! I‚Äôve discovered that the time you meditate doesn‚Äôt matter as long as it‚Äôs something. Even if it‚Äôs only one minute. We live in a world where we‚Äôre so distracted so if you can just focus on the present moment a little, it‚Äôs way better than nothing at all‚Äîover time you will be able to focus longer and longer.\n\n[deleted]\n\nJust start with once a day 5 or ten minutes as soon as you wake up (when your mind is fresh) If you struggle with unwanted thoughts then you can even do a few 1 minute meditation sessions throughout your day. There are tons of great ones on YouTube. Just find a guided voice that resonates with you. You should expect to feel better and notice a difference within a few weeks of consistently practicing. It‚Äôs important to realize that you don‚Äôt need to shut your thoughts off you can recognize they are there just don‚Äôt attach to them. Always come back to your breath. This will serve as your anchor of awareness. Just keep at it and you will eventually get better and better at being able to settle down your mind and those thoughts will begin to shift to ones that are on a positive frequency. It‚Äôs like walking, exercising, lifting weights. You must work out your mind as well. Hope this helps you on your journey:)\n\nWaking up by Sam Harris is the app I use for guided meditation. I'm not as consistent as I would like to be but I do think it has improved my life.\n\nHere is a link for free 30 days or you can download and get a free 2 week (? Not sure) trial directly from the app.https://dynamic.wakingup.com/shareOpenAccess/SC7B71B3B\n\nAmazing üí™\n\nThanks for sharing üôè best wishes in your journey\n\nHappy to hear the progress ! Just keep going üßòüèªü™¨\n\nThank you for the recommendation!\n\nWhat times of the day do you meditate?\n\nRead kodo sawaki advice to you that guy meditated most of his life I'd say don't be too happy too son good luck with your endeavour ;)\n\nAm an overthinker, will meditation help and what should I do to achieve the goal?\n\nI‚Äôm also typically an over thinker. Personally, I‚Äôve noticed improvement since I began this journey. I would start by checking out Balance. They have single meditations and meditation plans to help with overthinking. I would say just keep at it. Even if you miss a couple days when you first start, just keep going. I know how easy it can be to give up entirely after the first day or two that you skip. One thing that kept me going at first, was frequently looking up meditation benefits and reading studies about it, especially on days when I didn‚Äôt feel like meditating. Now I‚Äôm to a point where I look forward to my meditations each day. \n\nGood luck and best wishes!\n\nThat's amazing! Curious how long do you usually meditate?\n\nAnastasiia, Insight Timer Community Rep\n\nI have reported similar benefits\n\nGreat work!\n\nAny specific practice or guided video or anything? Do you use YouTube?\n\nCongratulations!\nI'm on day 3 and I already see huge benefits, I definitely will keep going!\n\nall i can say is all i can say is wow. can say i is all. wow. i can say all is wow\n\nApparently you have a way lot more to say than,  wow."

A lot of people who went though ego death while high and then think they're ready to be a guru for everyone around them.¬†\n\n\nI have gained a lot perspective from psychedelics, but I've met a lot of people who seem to think that getting high is the only way to be enlightened.

So eventually he gave them up.\n\nThere are also great stories about what happened when he gave large doses of LSD to his guru (nothing happened) and to a sadhu, who said it was pretty good, but not as good as meditation.\n\nI'm a big Ram Dass fan. I don't fully buy into his view on reincarnation, but his wisdom has helped me a lot on my journey¬†\n\nSure. I decided some time ago that we are not in our present form capable of apprehending the true nature of reality. This leaves each of us free to create a metaphysical model that we believe serves our evolution. And we can take from wherever and whoever we like to create that model.\n\nYes! We try to hard make sense of everything, but what if we actually can't!? Human thinking makes much more sense if we think that is the case.\n\nI am A novice in these matters, so I never really thought of the idea of ego death. But when I read what you wrote, I had to look it up and I think perhaps I may have realized something that happened to me recently.\n\n  \nFor the past 16 years (since starting medical residency), I became overwhelmed and couldn't accept that and could not face the possibility that I would fail at my career. I was steadily drifting away and people were telling me I changed but I didn't believe them and since I'm a physician I have Some unique tools to delude myself with rationalization. I mean while I And far from being an expert in psychology, I still had to memorize a ton of \\*\\*\\*\\* related to it and actually did a good bit of patient care specifically in that during my 10 years of medical training.\n\n  \nI finally realized something was really wrong when I had a panic attack for the first time a couple of weeks after my father in law died. A few weeks after that I woke up one morning and I could barely get out of bed. I had to call into work, despite never calling in sick a single day In 16 years. My body and mind shut my ass down And forced me to confront my problems. Fast forward two years later, and I've been in therapy and seeing a psychiatrist on a mild anxiety medicine and I thought I was doing fairly well and making a ton of progress. I'd start informally meditating and was trying to learn and use tools that my therapist was teaching me.\n\nThen one day While on vacation with my wife, I read an article about how it was recently discovered (or at least published in a peer reviewed journal) That up to five to 10 percent of people do not have much or any inner monologue. While I thought that was very strange and it was interesting to me, it wasn't until I talked to my wife, who I've been with for 20 years, who did not know what the \\*\\*\\*\\* I was talking about when I mentioned to her inner monologue. I couldn't believe it. How did she never know it? How was it possible She never realized that all of these references she heard to an inner monolog were not just some abstraction, it was quite literal.  My wife is a genius, and is one of the most brilliant oncologists that I know in the United States. And she has a love of language and was Studying poetry before she Decided to become a doctor. \n\nWe had this amazing discussion about how our minds worked and I had a chance to ask her a ton of questions, which she was initially a bit weirded out by, but eventually she started being More comfortable with the discussion. It was really interesting for her to tell me that what goes on in my mind sounds very tiring and very stressful, which is 100 percent true! \n\nAnd here is where I can't explain things. The next few days, I had a series of revelations  That caused me to view innumerable memories and behaviors or not what I thought they were. I could see it from a different perspective that I could never before. I am not religious and if anything I have a cynical attitude towards the organized religion, So I don't mean Revelation in a religious sense but I suppose it would be fair to say that it could be considered a spiritual revelation. I was able to recognize certain aspects of who I was and what my body and mind were trying to tell me all of these years that I was resisting. I'm already going on very long here and I don't want to drag this story out, but I really do feel like for a period of a few days I lost the sense of myself, meaning that I Recognized that for over 16 years I was not exactly who I thought I was, and that many of my perceptions were distortions, and that I had harmed a lot of people without meaning to. I've spent weeks processing what happened, and while I can't really say that it's something as significant as ego death per se, it does feel like it kind of describes the intensity of the experience I've had and how much differently I feel since I've had it. It's really weird and I don't like talking to anyone about it and the only reason why I'm doing it right now is because none of you all know me.\n\nSo whether I am right or wrong about this ego death thing, I do think it helps me try to further look into everything that I Know and don't know that I need to improve, so for that I'm grateful. Best wishes.\n\nI don't have time to respond now but I will later when I can fully and mindfully read your story.¬†\n\n\nThank you for sharing üíô¬†\n\nThank you, I appreciate the consideration.\n\nAfter my experience with ego death, I realized how little I knew. I wasn‚Äôt equipped to be anyone‚Äôs guru. Unfortunately, especially in these times, some of the wrong people are using these substances and they have the wrong idea of what they‚Äôre ‚Äúsupposed‚Äù to get from it.\n\nYes ! with a good and simple method, it‚Äôs no necessary to take any product to find the enlightenment.\n\nFirst off If you haven't done it you can't talk on it. Seconded thing it's not drug is a organic compound that's in every living organism. It's the only way to get towards the after life without physically dieing. We all are born with it and die with it flooding our brains. In rem sleep it is released in the panel gland. Dmt is the same chemical compound as what is produce in our Brain. Also it's not something to push on other people. Those people that your it more then a few times in the lifetime. People who do it all the time the chemistry jn there brain is  not there. Someone will coming into the chemical compound when there looking for it but 75 percent of the time to i, if your not ready for this substance stay away. It choose you the subtance nothing will ever change ir you gotta beb1000 0ercent prepared\n\nTrue enlightenment is without agenda and leaves no trace. It does not speak for there is nothing to say. \n\nI believe Zen Buddhism is to spirituality as stoicism is to philosophy. It does not gloat nor speak highly of itself. It is not some special thing.\n\nyup it‚Äôs just knowing we don‚Äôt know shit\n\nGreat point! Dogen said that ‚ÄúTo study the Buddha Way is to study the self; to study the self is to forget the self; to forget the self is to be actualized by myriad things. When actualized by myriad things, your body and mind as well as the body and mind of others drop away.‚Äù\n\nwe can also have fun with knowing we know nothing. Since feelings and mood are dependent on mental formations, we can use our imagination to perceive reality. When I breath I imagine breathing in light and energy (which honestly isn‚Äôt even that far off from conventional science). Way more freeing to be aware of letting the imagination run wild. It‚Äôs like being a kid again¬†\n\nI love this. I believe playfulness is apart of our original mind, our natural way of being. A quote comes to mind:\n\n‚ÄúIf one is to control their livestock, give them a wide open field to roam‚Äù\n\n\"True enlightenment\" - I never liked this term because it implies there is a summit. The summit of one mountain is the base of the next.\n\nMy major spiritual milestone changed me completely. I became a driven power house of clarity, no-bullshit focussed person. I built companies, took back my life, my freedom and I'm still going.\n\nDamn it left a trace. And I dragged a few friends with me.\n\nQuite the opposite: true enlightenment is already here, it‚Äôs in your nature.\n\nI specified true here to compare with false, which would be these fantastical, drug-induced experiences that inflate the ego, tricking the person that it is no longer alive.\n\nWhat's that milestone that changed you so much? What thought/realization? Please share :)\n\nNot the commentor, but as I continue my journey of enlightenment, I see through the delusions of reality that cause suffering and limit my potential. \n\nUnderstanding and observing the three characteristics will perpetually unfold reality until you see so clearly that ignorance becomes clear. It's impossible to describe with words, but it truly enables you to operate at peak capacity in all manners. \n\nThe milestones are chains that fall off as you eliminate craving and aversion, unify your mind and body, and remove that which inhibits your true self.\n\nI think part of the problem is how words are used. I feel like in a lot of pop culture, people use the term \"having an ego\" when referencing what I believe you'd refer to as \"having an overinflated ego\". Then they hear terms like \"ego death\" and approach it from that initial mindset, and suddenly ego is this evil thing instead of a tool. Their ego morphs into this \"not having an ego\". Without proper teachers, it's easy to be led astray (hell, I know I am and need a teacher).\n\n‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a story of a disciple who told his guru that he was going to a far place to meditate and hopefully attain enlightenment. So he sent the guru a note every six months to report the progress he was making. The first report said, ‚ÄúNow I understand what it means to lose the self.‚Äù The guru tore up the note and threw it in the wastepaper basket. After six months he got another report, which said, ‚ÄúNow I have attained sensitivity to all beings.‚Äù He tore it up. Then a third report said, ‚ÄúNow I understand the secret of the one and the many.‚Äù It too was torn up. And so it went on for years, until finally no reports came in. After a time the guru became curious and one day there was a traveler going to that far place. The guru said, ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you find out what happened to that fellow.‚Äù Finally, he got a note from his disciple. It said, ‚ÄúWhat does it matter?‚Äù And when the guru read that, he said, ‚ÄúHe made it! He made it! He finally got it! He got it!‚Äù\n\nExcerpt From\nAwareness\nAnthony De Mello\nhttps://books.apple.com/us/book/awareness/id455577384\nThis material may be protected by copyright.\n\n[removed]\n\nHe‚Äôs on the verge of something, it‚Äôs called psychedelics üòÜ\n\nThey never want to give you all of their money, which is strange.\n\nIt is largely nonsense, I agree. It just seems to strengthen the delusion that there is an ego to die in the first place, and that there is something unregenerate about the ego that is almost like a blockage to someone fulfilling a grandiose spiritual purpose.\n\nIt's a vague term that gets a lot of attention from the self-improvement crowd, I've felt it unhealthy to make an enemy of oneself in that way.\n\nAn ego is a construction that helps you navigate this world, it's very susceptible to influence, and has an uncanny ability of playing hide and seek with itself.\n\nLovely post. The ego itself is nothing more than another creation of our own minds, no more real than the past or the future.\n\nA true Awakened person does not go around proving that they are awakened. #no\n\nLet go the ego.\n\nPick up the yogurt and bananas\n\nSome almonds would go great with that.\n\nDon't forget the onion juice.\n\nThere‚Äôs a big difference between talking about it and trying to prove something. Talking about it can be fun, but if you‚Äôre trying to prove something then you‚Äôre probably propping up your ego. Which is fine, because eventually it will come crashing down, and that fall will lead you closer to letting go.\n\nI don‚Äôt agree that we shouldn‚Äôt talk about it, we‚Äôre doing that right now after all. I‚Äôm with Adyashanti when he says talking about enlightenment is never perfect. By talking about it you‚Äôre going to fail, and the purpose is to fail as well as you can.\n\nThe ego and self-absorption isn‚Äôt necessarily a problem for enlightenment either. It can be more of a problem to pretend to make your ego small, pretend to be enlightened and humble, and not express yourself, because then you will never be vulnerable enough for others to knock your ego. But this will inevitably fail too because pretending takes a lot of energy.\n\nAt the end of the day, just do you and you‚Äôll figure it out as you go.\n\nFraming my post as against discussing enlightenment misses the mark. It's about authenticity.\n\n[removed]\n\nbeautiful profile picture!\n\nEh. I see where you‚Äôre coming from. Personally, i do mention ego from time to time, although rarely‚Äî if it is relevant to the conversation and I am being asked to share my experience. \n\nI‚Äôve tripped a few times (like less than 5; not much), and i by no means experienced an ‚Äúego death‚Äù‚Äî I don‚Äôt trust my brain enough to take high doses of things. But what I will say‚Äî as someone with clinical depression and who has had CPTSD since childhood, a ‚Äútrauma brain‚Äù is literally all I know because I have no memories from my life before my trauma. So when I went on these trips, it was an extremely profound experience. What it felt like to me was as if my brain was given a clean slate, and I was no longer bound to my trauma and my depression. I was just ‚Äúme‚Äù without all the baggage. I got to feel what a non-CPTSD brain feels like. What I took from this was *not* ‚Äúwow, I need to go on trips all the time!‚Äù (because I have an addictive personality so I know that option is a no-go)‚Äî but instead what I got out of the experience was that if my brain can reach that ‚Äúclean slate‚Äù under some sort of influence, then that ‚Äúclean slate‚Äù brain is accessible, period. And that if I start incorporating daily practices and mindfulness into my routine, then it must be possible for me to eventually train my brain to reach that state by natural means. This was an epiphany for me that was a major step towards me being able to better manage my depression and CPTSD.\n\nAgain, this was not an ‚Äúego death‚Äù as the dose was way too low‚Äî but to me, it certainly felt like my ego was removed significantly. All of the baggage my brain carries from all of my past experiences that I had told myself was ‚ÄúMe‚Äù was just gone, and it was incredibly freeing. \n\nI don‚Äôt really care if people think I‚Äôm talking bullshit or whatever. It is just my personal experience and I am extremely grateful for it; it saved my life.\n\nI dislike posts that say stuff like \"I have reached enlightenment!\"...sure, bud. You probably wouldn't be posting if you did. \"I let go of my ego.\" No, you didn't. Thas just your ego thinking you did because your ego wants to feel good about yourself. Try again people!\n\nAgreed. The current obsession with \"ego death\" has replace the anxiety in the dharma scene world about being \"enlightened.\"  I myself had a difficult ego death experience after about 35 years of practice in Vedanta and Buddhism. Rather than walking on water afterward, I basically got rid of my dharma trappings and focused on just being a normal human being--and went on to be just an ordinary person with the same ups and downs but just a different  private attitude about \"what it's all about.\"\n\nYeah this whole ego death nonsense is so deluded \n\nYou‚Äôd die without an ego \n\nIt‚Äôs about having healthy ego - not no ego\n\nA message from my ego to you all!\n\nI personally think that enlightenment isn't real. It is chase for meaning. A goal to run towards raising up in the absence of others.  It's the human thing to do, believe in a greater spiritual existence and experience.\n\nFor me even if enlightenment is real, people should choose the road to it, and not the goal it self. In the end, I can say that this comment is a message from my ego, an ego of a none beliver. Not some absolute truth, and that what I think matters.\n\nOh, it‚Äôs real. Check out r/StreamEntry. I don‚Äôt know as where I‚Äôve seen posts from truly enlightened people, but definitely from those who can see it from where they are.\n\nThis is the exact mental conversation I have with myself on this topic. My ego rolls its eyes at these enlightenment posts. If someone was really enlightened, would they be gloating on reddit? Doubt it. The whole thing is just grasping, which is exactly what we‚Äôre all here to quit doing. But also, I recognize that I have a bad attitude about it and my ego is in the driver seat on this. So idk whatever lol\n\nSteer clear of anyone who has commercialized meditation, especially if their claim is \"You need me(or us, or our courses), or you WILL fail.\"\n\nWhy? Because if their ego is out of the picture, they know they will survive, and don't need \"wealth\" to prove or insure that. A true guru does not charge anything to a true seeker.\n\nI find quitting smoking not so hard at all,  I‚Äôve done it dozens of times- someone from a bygone era\n\nYou just described most of the members here!\n\nIt‚Äôs definitely a great reminder for those people\n\nthis a very real phenomenon. Some of the most egotistical and narcissistic people i've ever met are of the 'spiritual' type. \n\nBut then again perhaps they are practicing in order to overcome these traits. Compassion is key.\n\nYeah, spiritual egos swell up huge at times the whole combine that with being a bit of an outcast it easily becomes:\n\n\"My body is a temple and I'm doing all of these things to reach enlightenment and a higher state of being, so I'm so much better and awake then all these mindless sheep walking around like robots and believing everything the government and society tells them.\"\n\nThere‚Äôs a lot of spiritual materialism going on in this sub. It‚Äôs become pretty rampant.\n\nNever heard that term before, quite intriguing. Thank you very much.\n\nI've observed the same thing in the spiritual community. Can't get rid of ego\n\nI thought i was the only one that noticed this!!!!\n\nYes ! I experiment it‚Äôs more effective to be in peace which the ego.\n\nAndrew Holecek‚Äôs course on ‚ÄúPreparing to Die‚Äù-Understanding the Book of the Dead and the 3 phases of death. This is a Buddhist belief:\n1. Ego is exclusive identification with form\n2. Without the body there is no ego, no self\n3. We cannot live in this world without our body and ego. \n4. We are not letting the ego go cause without it we can‚Äôt be in this world\n5. So, learning how to work with your ego is the answer \n6. Knowing your mind is knowing your ego.\n7. Knowing &amp; Controlling your mind is a healthy way to live inside this body with your ego. \n7. Ways to do this: meditation, Buddhist psychology, DBT (Dialectical Behavior Therapy is a zen based program.), etc. \n8. Living in this world is all about relationships, Relationships with each other, animals, material world,etc. Training our ego to be a Bodhisattva.\n\nEckert Tolle talks about this. It‚Äôs probably a better state to be in, then hating everything, but Tolle describes the risk of becoming and attaching to the image of that sort of person.\n\n‚Äú‚ÄúThe role-playing identity of spiritual teacher is a mental image, a form. If you are identified with it, it is nothing more than ego‚Äîdisguised. It will then have all the unconscious characteristics of the ego, such as the need to be right, the need to have power over others, and the need for recognition.‚Äù‚Äù\n\nI think about this a lot too, and it annoys me so much lol\n\nA lot of the spiritual community trashes the ego and makes it evil and wants to get rid of it as much as possible, but without it humans, or any physical thing, wouldn‚Äôt exist. \n\nWe only ever have our own perspective and sources (if you believe) and we can tap into sources (which I guess would be ‚Äúsuspending the ego‚Äù) but then if you constantly did that you wouldn‚Äôt ever take action because source is already content. And if you never took action, there would be no point in existing at all. Thus, you have to take action through the ego.\n\nFor me, it was a coming to term with who I was inside...egotistic, selfish,, and cruel.¬†\n\n\nI was always like this, I hid it so I could live as though I am a good person. Or show others.¬†\n\n\nBut now I finally see the value of living true to who I am, no matter how ugly I find it.\n\n\nIt is a necessary process for some.¬†\n\nDoesn't 'letting go of the ego' just mean to let go of the idea that there is an immortal, or rather, an unchanging idea of 'I',or 'self' that with cling to?\n\nTotally depends on the person, but for sure there are illusions within the illusion. Surely many who believe to have ‚Äúachieved something‚Äù regarding the ego have more to uncover. \n\nIt‚Äôs a tricky business talking to one another about this stuff though. Sometimes what sounds like spiritual pride stemming from ego is an honest enthusiasm for a perceived truth. And sometimes an honest enthusiasm for a perceived truth is a very deliberate front based on spiritual pride!\n\nEdit: The very best experience for me has been removing judgement from all of this nonsense (as much as possible; it is a work in progress) and allowing room for both. It‚Äôs all a part of the happening.\n\nThis is called spiritual materialism*. When you find golden nuggets in life, touch them and go üòé\n\nEgo is false glory. Jimi Hendrix never went, \"Hey, I'm Jimi fucking Hendrix\"\n\nHe just played the fucking riff.\n\nIt's just such a fine line between \"I don't care what you think of me\" and arrogant behavior.\n\nHowever, it's also your ego who is judging it as arrogant instead of just ignoring it. It's all a loop and therefore almost not even worth talking about. It's hilarious.\n\nYou're making baseless assumptions about my inner thoughts. Claiming someone's perspective is driven solely by ego is just as limiting as the concept itself + I don't find them arrogant; I find them delusional‚Äîa significant difference.   \n  \nIt's not about whether actions are ego-driven, but the hypocrisy and enablers who mistakenly believe that ignoring everything is the essence of mindfulness. Some of us value speaking up and the insights discussions provide. Others, however, tend to derail every conversation with accusations of projection.\n\nOk\n\nYou've discovered spiritual bypassing I believe...\n\n‚ÄúThe ego that can be named is not the true ego.‚Äù üòÖ\n\nTotally agree. That's because the more you try to let go of something, the more attached you become. What you resist, persists!\n\nyes because it's nonsense. ego is a wonderful thing.\n\nI think some of it is because ‚Äúit takes one to know one‚Äù. Meaning, now that I am aware of my ego and its tendencies, I can tell you all about it. Then the cycle repeats until they step out of it again and again until they see the bigger picture. Just an opinion.\n\nThey‚Äôre attached to the ego system of ‚ÄúI‚Äôm awakened‚Äù. Eckhart Tolle talks about this. I listen too much of his wisdom. Here is as close as I can get to what I‚Äôm talking about. This was a ChatGPT except:\n\nIn his book The Power of Now and other talks, Tolle emphasizes the importance of presence and detachment from the ego, which includes not getting attached to concepts or images of enlightenment. He believes that enlightenment is about being present and not about adhering to any particular image or identity\n\nDo I understand you correctly?  You are saying, ' they are aware but have not implemented it.'  \nAwareness before change.\nIt may or may not be their time.\nChange is unfamiliar.   Change is scary. Change is happening all around us, and we don't even realize it.  Some people change their lives radically, and some change their lives incrementally.   Each must do what they believe is best for them.  If it takes a little longer for someone, why should it bother you? It is their path to walk.  Stay in your own lane.\n\nNo, what I'm saying is that there's a trend of people not calling out delusions in this community. I feel the need to speak up because, despite its good intentions, this and the broader spiritual community often enable hypocrisy and untruthfulness. Instead of pushing for 'change,' maybe some people should just stop with the year-long attention-slurping ego trips. It's uncomfortable being around that vibe, and I'm clearly not the only one who feels that way. Maybe they should consider getting out of my lane. :) \n\nMindfulness isn't about being able to meditate next to a fighter jet; that's just showing off.\n\nYes! \n\nI ended up relating more to the nafs from Islam. There are many nafs (egos) instead of just one. Once you take some down becomes easier to recognise the others and keep at it. But I feel like it goes against the whole ego death bullshit\n\n[deleted]\n\nImagine if ppl didn't call you out, you might still believe others enjoy listening to your misplaced ego trip üòâ.\n\nIt‚Äôs more like you‚Äôre seeing others stuck where youve been stuck and Id love to help or give hidden tips so they can free themselves like I did/ still work on doing (I dont think there‚Äôs an end to working on urself and getting better/ being good and free) (idk if that makes sense Im tired, I don‚Äôt necessarily like the association of self absorption and getting rid of the ego?)\n\nIf you can do something for someone, or give them something, or teach them something that helps them or is of benefit to them, without expecing appreciation or expecting anything in return, you have let go of your ego in doing the deed.\n\n\nYou can do it once, or every now and then, or make a habit out of it.\n\nThat's just being nice. Assuming that the ego is only fed by external validation is a bit short-sighted.\n\nI think it goes further than just being nice. For eg, it's not a gesture towards the less fortunate or a product of just being a nice guy, or going out of your way for someone. It's where one understands that things are not transactional. That as long as you understand that you are not above or below another, you are guided by your true self.\n\nYou're dressing up basic decency with philosophical jargon, but it doesn't make it deeper. Not being transactional or avoiding thoughts of superiority is just common sense, not some enlightened state. The fact that you need to frame it in lofty terms just proves my original point‚Äîthis whole ego thing is often just another way to stay self-centered.\n\nMy best response to you is to try and keep things simple in our life. To stay self-centered perhaps, but I would say self-balanced. I think it is a good way to enlightenment.\n\n\nThere is a lot of judgement coming from you in your posts, I needed to point that out. Without trying to be instructional as many of your posts indicate, it may serve you better to be focussed on yourself than on others.\n\n[deleted]\n\nIf you read his books, you'll learn he calls out this exact behavior as the spiritual ego.\n\nThe word is not the thing.\n\nSo words have no reality, they can just point.\n\nNow can a deceived person parrot platitudes? Of course they can and they will. But what does it matter to you?\n\nWho is it that is annoyed by that?\n\nLet's not pretend asking why I'm moved to call it out is a deeper insight; it's just avoiding the point.\n\nAren't you just like them?\n\nThere's a distinction between observing a pattern and embodying it. My observation isn't about claiming superiority or denying my own flaws‚Äîit's about noticing a tendency in discussions around ego and enlightenment. Calling out hypocrisy isn't necessarily hypocritical; it's about encouraging authenticity.  \n  \nInstead of engaging with the topic, you seem very focused on making me question myself. Not every observation is a projection of some unconscious issue. Sometimes, it's just about the human need to share and converse.\n\nNobody is actually enlightened. Ironically, it is a bunch of ego shit.\n\nYou know what, a lot of times when I give advice, its mostly me advising myself because I feel this is what I need\n\nSelf-reflection and checking for projection are valuable practices. However, in \"spiritual and pseudo- psychological\" circles, these ideas can sometimes be overused to sound insightful without really engaging with the topic. This can create a subtle sense of superiority and shut down real dialogue. Not every observation or question is a cry from the unconscious; sometimes, it's just about discussing the issue at hand.\n\nYou are right.\n\nBut there are times when people are projecting their subconscious. Both exist.\n\nYes, the vast majority of people are aware of that. It's not a huge insight. It‚Äôs tiresome that in every post someone feels the need to bring it up and ignore the actual subject.\n\nThis is a pretty huge insight for me. \n\nIt's not as if your observation is novel or a huge insight. A vast majority of people also know this. It seems like you are the one talking down. Seems like you just need to talk shit about people. If it's tiresome and repetitive don't engage.\n\nYour right, I reacted a bit triggered.\n\nPerhaps they just do less people pleasing and focus on their own journey and it comes off as self-absorbed? Just theorizing here lol my intention with meditation is to get more comfortable with self so I am seeking less validation, approval, etc. from others in a way.\n\nThe post gives me holier than tho feeling about OP.\n\nWhat about calling out performative 'enlightenment' feels like a 'holier than thou' vibe to you? Being flawed doesn't disqualify me from noticing and discussing these patterns.\n\nThat perpetrates judging. There are many teachers out there. You cannot be the arbitrary of who deserves to talk about enlightenment.\n\nSo, now you're the one who decides what's worth discussing? That's rich coming from someone accusing others of being judgmental.\n\n[deleted]\n\n[deleted]\n\n[deleted]\n\n[deleted]\n\nOkay judgy mickjudgerson\n\nIronic.\n\nDo you know the root word for ironic?\n\nEristic.¬†\n\nOh, some of us knew this post was coming after reading the one where OP said they were finally ‚Äú[‚Ä¶] ready the let-go the ego [‚Ä¶]‚Äù or had an ego death or some nonsense like that..\n\nAlso people who talk about self absorbed people in hypotheticals are usually narcasists who are judging others to justify to themselves their own narcasisim.\n\nBeing on a higher wavelenth you dont trouble yourself with such things. Observations become just that and u let them flow\n\nIt seems like you're making a lot of assumptions about my intent. Calling out performative behaviors can also reflect a desire for authenticity and the human need to share and interact.\n\n'Observations become just that and you let them flow,' yet you're suggesting the other person has narcissism based on a single post. What's your point here?"

May this insight stabilize in your day to day life and lead you to awakening\n\nbut what \"is\" the awakening then? ofcourse ive heard people use this word a lot but for me its vague when i read it like in your comment. is is the ultimate goal? and then?\n\nFor me, it happened many years ago before I even started meditation.  I laid down in a field of flowers staring up at the sky. It's hard to explain,  but I had a realization about how everything and everyone on Earth is connected. My vision zoomed out into the cosmos and I understood how insignificant all of our superficial problems were, and how amazing and beautiful life is. Every piece of me morphed into something greater. Ever since then I've felt like I've been at a higher level than everyone else.  Not in a judgemental way, but in a way that I want to share it and try to help everyone break down the walls that can't let them see what's truly important so that if we're all enlightened then we could collectively ascend into a world of light and love. \nThe crazy part is, this happened unexpectedly.  Completely random moment in time. I didn't intend to find enlightenment. It found me.\n\nGenuinely curious.  Do you have a history of drug use?  Is this a natural realization or substance-aided?  Thank you.  (I ask because this is very similar to insights friends have shared after drug experiences.)\n\nAt that time it was before I partook in any substances. These days psilocybin helps expand my mind even more. It's an ongoing upgrade. After getting lost in this civilization it helps to reboot from time to time. Reconnect.\n\nAwakening is to be in a permanent state of detachment of the body mind activities although you are responsible for your duties. You fully understand and experience that you are the conciesness.\n\n\nThere's not then.\n\nFor me it was an entire collapse of the belief system society gave to me. I could see we exist forever whether we want to or not. I could and can see the source of everything is love/light. I could see everyone trapped in their earth 'jacket' - they/you are God but God forgotten it's God. It's basically a knowing.\n\nIMO it‚Äôs a personal goal. It‚Äôs mostly the same, but different for everyone. Only the one seeking knows what it is once it‚Äôs obtained.\n\nbut is it like a starting point of awakening, like now i know my ultimate goal in life.\n\nor is it more like ive reached the ultimate goal and now i experience the awakening because of it.\n\ni hope that makes sense haha..\n\nI get what you‚Äôre saying, even if you feel that you have reached the ‚Äúultimate‚Äù goal, it‚Äôs still not over. Just like in life, you can always improve.\nIt‚Äôs like that quote I keep seeing around here. \n‚ÄúBefore enlightenment chop wood, carry water. After enlightenment chop wood, carry water.‚Äù\n\nDon‚Äôt quote me on this, but I feel like the pursuit of enlightenment, is ultimately what enlightenment means.\n\nthank you for the clarification :)\n\nRecognizing your true nature, and abiding it. I always think back to the last words of the Buddha, which were something to the effect of \"make a light of yourself\"\n\nfor me, i think of it as that state of peace/infinity that we have all already experienced. Whenever you lose track of time, whenever you feel filled with deep love, whenever you are happy to be alive, that is an awakened state (maybe we could find a different word for it). Awakening could also be realizing that we can actively strive to be in that state more. And trust that life will always lead us back into that state eventually.\n\nSounds amazing, of course this is a practice and not a final state - your \"accepting yourself fully\" isn't one and done, it is something you will likely need to regularly practice.\n\nA practice I'll do until the day I die.\n\nAnd one that has only taught me that if you meet difficult emotions with self compassion and warm, loving mindfulness, you can transmute them into joy.\n\nWt kinda of meditatoon do u practice?\n\nWhat's worked the best for me are unguided meditations, in which I lean into uncomfortable emotions and meet them with self-compassion. I'll never forget a teaching by the monk Thich Naht Yahn who said difficult emotions are like a crying baby. Once you attend to them with warm, loving acceptance and curiosity -- not judgment -- you can transmute them into joy.\n\nWooo, thats eye opener, i dont do much but i rly loved the concept of vipassana meditation which i read from the art of living and tried it by myself. Then i decided to stop cuz the book warns \" it should not be done without a trainer for the first time\". The training is all free. Sadly, the training center is far away and i couldnt find a good break...\n\nIn the morning I read a list of things I'm grateful for, it's like I sow a seed of gratitude for the rest of my day. If a negative emotion pops up about something or someone I'm more prone to feel grateful that I even have that thing in my life.\n\nHe is a great teacher, and you explain this very well. Thank you for that insight.\n\nThat‚Äôs deep üôè\n\nThe Self cannot be killed!\n\nI had this once also not too long ago. I wrote a personal philosophy after which had helped guide me to previous unknown states of being and qualities of mind. Be sure to write about it, or make art, a mantra, music, something you can go back to. Anchor this feeling to something creative you can keep forever...¬†\n\nSounds like a beautiful idea! Will do !\n\nI found this about three weeks ago, and I am so happy for You as well‚ù§Peace, Love, and Light to you my friend\n\nAaaaaaw, thank you\n\nThats healing üëç\n\nHow long did you feel that for? Was it a fleeting feeling or is it with you still from moment to moment.\n\nDo you mean the joy while sobbing? Or the peace and contentment afterward? If you're talking about the former it lasted for around 10-15 minutes. But If you're talking about the latter, it left a mark on me. I don't feel the urge to 'prove myself' anywhere nearly as much as before. Also, note that this moment came after only about 18 months of therapy, journalling, meditation, etc...\n\nThe Kingdom of Heaven is within indeed, if only it's Divine Majesty could be described. \n\nRemaining quiet and ever more deeply enjoying the beauty of this experience is the purpose of our existence. ‚ú®Ô∏è \n\nNobody needs to know about it and that's when it's most joyful.\n\nOnly this Joy is Real. ü•∞\n\nSo happy for you!\n\nSo who is you?\n\nThe real me is a goofball full of love and compassion, somebody very creative, expressive, and curious about everyone and everything.\n\nAnything but what society wanted me to be -- a 'masculine' man who is 'stoic' and 'tough' and always 'strong' and 'capable' and 'disciplined' and never 'weak', 'girly', etc...\n\nCongrats. It‚Äôs unfortunate that some of us have to hide from our true selves in order to please the people in charge. \n\nIf there‚Äôs any solace, I can‚Äôt imagine those people are as content and peaceful as you are.\n\nThis is all wonderful! Thank you for sharing this experience!\n\nJust thinking about how deeply interconnected we are, we breath the same air, walk on the same earth, how can we speak about \"I\"? What are the borders? Before our scientific paradigm the body was social, shared, comunity (humans and non-humans): people sharing the emoticons of peoole they love, instead of egoistic, alone, independent lifestyle. Maybe that goofball of love is more than you, or you are more than you think you can describe, big hug brother üíó\n\nDid you accept everyone and everything else as fully as you accepted yourself?\n\nAnd 99 percent of people only hurt themselves and others because they are deeply, deeply suffering and don't have the tools or knowledge to handle or manage their pain. Even the nastiest people on the planet have a kernel of their humanity still alive somewhere within them, and the world would definitely be a better place if we stopped obsessing about 'an eye for an eye'. True justice ends the cycle of suffering, whilst still holding the necessary people accountable. It doesn't perpetuate it.\n\nThe world is as it is supposed to be. Anyway congrats, you made amazing progress. Not many people reach where you are today, not even temporarily. Whatever you are doing as a practice, it works for you.\n\n  \nEnjoy today, friend!\n\nI never judge anyone.  Even now I'm super flawed and will always be flawed. But that's more than okay. It only means that I'm human.\n\nWell done! Happiness doesn't come from owning stuff. Designer or not. In comes from within.\n\nBeautiful. I had this exact same experience during the last holotropic breathwork class I did.\n\nSounds like what I am searching for\n\nThis made my day x\n\nI really want to achieve this. So bad. I‚Äôm weary of dealing with the same internal struggles and I wish I could experience lasting meditative joy\n\nYou got this! Just always give yourself the love and acceptance you should have had as a child.\n\nCongratulations on waking up and realizing that the \"reality\" we create is an illusion. If \"bad things\" happen in a nightmare, we didn't \"do\" anything except experience the machinations of our mind. It's a wonderful thing to discover. Welcome back! Blessings &lt;3\n\nMay this new light never be taken away from you again\n\nEverything is impermanence\n\nBeautiful ‚ô•Ô∏è\n\nIt‚Äôs an epic feeling ü§©üí™üèº\n\nI appreciate that you posted this experience. \n\nYou point out many similarities that seem to line up with my own experience, and it is really nice to know others have felt that way. \n\nThank you!\n\nSO inspirational! Thank-you!\n\nWe are all secretly beautiful\n\nThat sounds incredibly profound and transformative. It‚Äôs amazing to experience such a deep connection with your true self and find joy and peace within. It‚Äôs moments like these that remind us of the inner strength and resilience we possess. Thank you for sharing such a meaningful experience.\n\nHappy for you\n\nPlease teach me your ways! I don‚Äôt ever seem to be able to meditate. But man I need to feel that peace! Happy you could find yours.üí™üèº\n\nWow this is rare! I'm happy you managed to get the insight that led to profound experience. Thank you for sharing your realization.\n\nWhat a joy to read about this experience. I'm really happy for you.\n\nThis is the most beautiful thing I‚Äôve read in a while, wow thanks for making me feel whatever it is that i felt\n\nThis was my exact experience when I realized what truly loving myself meant‚Ä¶ congratulations üéâ ü´∂‚ö°Ô∏èüôå\n\nExperience like this makes us realise and brings closer to the truth. \n\nI wish I have this experience myself.\n\nRamana Maharschi was with you that day\n\nYet do you FEEL this realizing? the Mind/Body thinks/feels this at times yet if it weren't for the 'down' times you could not differentiate the universal parts of your Self   suggest you read Pema Chodran or Krishnamurti about what you're going thru  Namaste\n\nMay I ask you your testosterone levels\n\nMy testosterone levels? I'm curious. Why do you ask?\n\nHow did you do it? How long did it take to achieve this??\n\nOne word: vulnerability. The moment you shine a spotlight on all the rot and darkness and pain in your subconscious and meet whatever feelings come up with only love and acceptance, day in, day out, the closer you become to the real you, to the wounded little girl within who just wants to be seen, heard, loved, and cared for. Personally, it took around 18 months of inner work. But you can do it too! Maybe even faster than I did. Lol.\n\nI know what you mean and it‚Äôs incredible!! For me it was a little less dramatic, but it was indeed a distinct crossover point, and it happened during meditation. It‚Äôs been over a year since that moment, and I‚Äôm just‚Ä¶ glad. Feels like the fruition of a lot of gradual study and work and practice. I love that I KNOW now that this path actually leads to a place where peace of mind is the default. Now I‚Äôm training to become a therapist, something I wasn‚Äôt ready to do before, but now I am because I have inner credibility if that makes sense.\n\nI'm so happy for you. No doubt your personal experiences will help you become a great therapist!\n\nThank you\n\nYou are amazing üëè üôèü©∑‚ú®Ô∏è\n\nI mean this sincerely and with love, enjoy it.\nBad times pass, good times pass, life is change. Nothing is permanent, I'm not trying to be a smarty pants, but as we work through old issues and clear away false beliefs etc, generally other stuff will come out of the shadows.\nI hope your path is smooth with few bumps\n\nLove is not what we do, Love is who we are!! Welcome back home to yourSELF üíï\n\nThe Buddha nature is always there already. Enlightenment is only a shedding of ignorance, fear, and confusion. There is nothing to gain or transcend to; it is there already waiting to be recognized\n\nI‚Äôve had a similar feeling when I understood that any evil acts or ‚Äúsins‚Äù from my past actions never tarnished my True Self. It may have affected my mind or body in the past but not my Self. It‚Äôs a lovely experience that makes me want to be a better person. So happy for you üôè‚ô•Ô∏è\n\nAnyone else feeling like it‚Äôs a bunch of bs? I‚Äôm intelligent and critically analyze everything - I‚Äôve meditated, researched, felt like I was awakening and ultimately..nothing so I left the meditation group. It‚Äôs calming but not life changing for me. Just curious anyone else felt like this?..\n\nIf you went into it to change your life specifically, you went with the wrong intent. Meditation is for the betterment of the world, by you.\n\nI know it must have been extremely frustrating and disappointing. But if you went into this kind of work, expecting to think and analyze and intellectualize your way to a more peaceful state of mind, then you were going in the wrong direction. Meditation is the opposite way. Its about quieting the mind -- a.k.a thinking less -- and allowing yourself to *feel* and *experience* more. \n\nIn any case, I wish you the best. You got this üí™\n\nIdk how lol\n\nHmmmmm......I started counting, OP.....\n\nI counted how many times you used a form of \"I\". \n\nI counted how many times you used \"me\".\n\nI counted how many times you used \"my\".\n\nIt would seem to me that anyone who expresses that \n\nmuch self-validation and self-affirmation might not be as \n\n\"accepting\" of themselves as they represent.\n\nJust a thought..........\n\nFeel free to elaborate. I'd like to know more.\n\nThey are trying to explain that someone who is fully enlightened doesnt feel the so called I, ME no more. This \"i\" is like a river, the water keeps flowing amd changing with new ones. likewise our thoughts and portion of our body keeps changing. Nothing is permanent. So, there aint no such thing as an i and me.....\n\nI think what they are saying maybe is that the practice takes us more towards unity of self or the cessation of self. In the pursuit of either we tend to blur the lines of what we call as self entirely. Maybe they are pointing it out that since you used \"I\" a lot you might not be experiencing what you think you are experiencing? I am not sure but they need to clarify further\n\nThanks, S D.....you said it much more consisely than I would have. \n\n\"Don't use ten words when five will do\", right?   üòÄ\n\n@ O P. \n\nFunny thing that tends to occur with people who do a lot of \n\nregular meditation is that using \"I\", \"me\", \"my\" and \"mine\" seem \n\nto gradually reduce all by themselves.  The feeling that I get is \n\nthat they seem to feel unnecessasry and just extra verbage, ya know?\n\nAs the ego gradually dissolves? I see what you mean, and think you might be onto something here. But unless you are Jesus, Mohammed, or the Buddha, we all still have an ego. If you've ever read David R. Hawkins's book about the scale of human consciousness, the ego doesn't fully dissolve until you are past maybe peace on the scale. It takes a lifetime of this kind of work.\n\nHmmmm.... I'll need to think on that. Ibn al-Arabi spent 12 years under a SUFI \n\nmaster before returning to the Middle East and writing some of the most\n\ncompelling and insightful books on the mystical path. The problem with \n\nsuch masters of mysticism is that their informed readership have usually \n\nbeen adherents of some time themselves resulting in a kind of \"impatience\"\n\nwith all of that same  verbage. Found exactly the same thing the\n\nreading Eckhart and Merton. Thats one of the downsides to \n\nmeditation. As you quiet down, the noise around you becomes so \n\nmuch more noxious and intrusive. \n\nFWIW.\n\nHmmmmm......I started counting, OP.....\n\nI counted how many times you used a form of \"I\". \n\nI counted how many times you used \"me\".\n\nI counted how many times you used \"my\".\n\nIt would seem to me that anyone who expresses that \n\nmuch self-validation and self-affirmation might not be as \n\n\"accepting\" of themselves as they represent.\n\nJust a thought.........."

    "body": "I started meditating a few weeks ago, and shortly after, I started to get good at relaxing every muscle one by one and really paying attention to the thoughts that naturally come into my mind. That‚Äôs when I noticed how quickly my thoughts race which led me to attempt to slow the thoughts down. \n\nThat‚Äôs when I noticed that the thoughts were coming from a part of my brain that felt tense, almost as if it was a muscle that was constantly being flexed. After some practice, it felt like I was physically able to relax this ‚Äúthought‚Äù muscle in my brain and after that, the racing thoughts disappeared. I can now consciously relax this ‚Äúbrain muscle‚Äù when I feel like I‚Äôm getting anxious and all the anxiety just melts away. Meditating every day allows me to keep this ‚Äúmuscle‚Äù relaxed which has almost eliminated the anxiety that I felt on a daily basis. Life changing. \n\nEdit: I‚Äôm glad this is resonating with so many people. The main type of meditation I use for this is mindfulness. ",

    "all_comment_text": "It being a ‚Äúmuscle‚Äù to relax is such a good way of putting it, tried it out and it works like a charm\n\nIt really is, meditation is one of the greatest cures to my anxiety I've ever found. And its free!\n\nYep for me to, really helps calm my intrusive thoughts..\n\nSeriously, awesome way of putting it from OP. I was able to just relax consciously right now. Didn't realize I was so tense. The pressure in my brain \"muscle\" is gone now ahaha\n\nRight!!!  Pressure in the Brain!!  Help!\n\nIm not sure if these are jokes but how do you do this?\n\nOh, no no I wasn't joking when I wrote that. I kinda make myself \"aware\" that without even realising it (auto pilot mode), my whole body/head/any certain part is being flexed in a tense chokehold.\n\nSo with the awareness of that, I can loosen my grip on those muscles, I try to let myself think slower (when I'm stressed, I get \"tunnel vision\" in my brain and it hurts)\n\nI think its the intention of simply just letting myself melt which loosens the tension bit by bit, almost instantly sometimes. \n\nHope this explains it somehow!\n\nOh thank you for the explanation! I think I got it\n\nI felt the opposite, my anxiety did not get better with meditation. I still dont know why\n\nIt's normal at the begining. You are progressively more aware of subtile bits of anxiety that you didn't noticed before. \n\nSticking to the pratice if it's bearable, you should notice the anxiety regress again.\n\nHowever, for ones with deep traumas, professional help could ease the process.\n\nThis is so true\n\nI bought some magnesium flakes and made my own magnesium spray. I used magnesium flakes and distilled water.  Put it in my spray bottle, and I spray it on whenever I'm getting worked up before I go to bed and whenever I see my bottle. I have it with me everywhere I go. I spray it on my armpits or wherever my skin is showing.  The relief is subtle but glorious.  I live in the States, and most of the food we are consuming depletes our magnesium. When I do happen to get worked up about something, I've noticed that I am able to get over things faster. It's changed my life. \nTake note that it may itch at first.  If it's unbearable, use it 15 minutes before you take a shower.  It helps me sleep, use the bathroom, and help me remain calm. It's also used for aches and pains.  Do some research to learn all the benefits. Magnesium spray has changed my life.  The best part about it is that it's fairly cheap if you make it yourself, and it can be put to just about any spray bottle. I've been trying to repurpose my bottles. Saves on waste. And it's all natural ingredients. If we lived close, I would give you a bottle to try out. The only time I don't have a bottle of magnesium spray on me is when I give it away. \nEven better if you get too much, you might have a watery stool.  But it's mild, and there's no pain or need to have a toilet close by all day. I hope you try it.  I'm 98% sure it will help. It's like magic.  Best of luck!\n\nAnother amazing way to get magnesium is eating hemp hearts. They are delicious and have a nutty flavor and are not crunchy. I believe for a serving size you get 60% of your RDA of magnesium. They are also a great source of healthy fats and protein.\n\nYES!  I did not know this! I appreciate you telling me.  THANK YOU!  I know that hemp oil and seeds have great benefits.  I appreciate you! Where am I going to get hemp hearts?  I've been wanting to experiment with hemp for a while now.  You have given me more reasons to get started! I'm excited üòä\n\nNo problem. You can find them usually at any grocery. Try Walmart if you go there in the baking aisle or if you prefer ordering online you could also get them on Amazon. I also noticed a bit late that the packages say to refrigerate after opening. Completely missed that for a few weeks but I refrigerate them now.\n\nBe well\n\nwould magnesium supplement pills work too if i don't wanna deal with a spray?\n\nYES! \nThere are different kinds of magnesiums. I tried one of them in pill form, and I didn't notice the difference like I am able to with the spray.  I hated wasting money on the pills and losing the majority of the magnesium from my digestive tract.  I have read that taking vitamin D and magnesium during a meal helps the magnesium absorb better.  I'm not sure which type of magnesium absorbs the best.  The stores will let you buy every type of magnesium, but how much do I get from ingesting them? With the magnesium I chose, i didn't notice any difference. \nI also take celtic salt.  I get up in the morning and put a pinch of celtic salt on my tongue, and while it's dissolving, i fill my water bottle, and then I'll take a drink.  Celtic salt has 3 different magnesium in it.  You benefit the most by letting it sit on your tongue before drinking the water.  I quit using the cheap iodine table salt completely.  Celtic salt has 82 essential minerals in it. Oh my goodness, I love celtic salt. Taking celtic salt helps every cell hold the water we drink so we can hydrate instead of drinking a bunch of water and just peeing it out.  \nYou can buy magnesium spray.  I chose to make my own because of how much it costs.  And I know that it's magnesium and distilled water.  And not a bunch of ingredients i can't even pronounce or know what those ingredients are.  Are they good or bad? \nApplying magnesium topically is how I know I'm getting the full benefits of the magnesium.  I tried to turn my notifications on for this in case I needed to answer questions.  It didn't work.  If you're not discouraged because I took so long to answer....I will try to check reddit every morning if you do have any more questions.  I'm not an expert. I'm just sharing my experience.\n\nok thank you! i will look into the celtic salt as well\n\nDon't worry, it takes time for meditation to show its effects. Sometimes it can take a while, but eventually, you'll start noticing a calmer mind. Keep at it!\n\nMaybe its because u are actively reminded of it everyday and while u put forces to cure there are other equally placed to grow it more\n\nI had the same. It's normal. Meditation is not about being calm it is about getting to know what you feel what you block\n\nMeditation dissolves your ego. About 30% of people who reach this experience are deeply disturbed by it. The majority instead feels a deep relaxation.\n\nI am in that 30% too. The death of my ego only made me realize how short my life is. Meaninglessness isn't soothing for everyone.\n\nStart with 1 minute a day and work your way up. When you work out the muscle it gets stronger. Your brain just isn't used to the resistance of racing thoughts yet.\n\nCut your carbs.\n\nJust curious, why does this help?\n\nCarbs excites your brain and, compared to ketone bodies, are a worse kind of energy source.\n\nI'm into a carnivore diet right now and I never felt my mind in such good order before. I even stopped to uncontrollably talk alone, which is an annoying issue I had for my entire life.\n\nCarbs metabolism creates a good deal of oxidative damage and this is essentially the basis for all the common health issues people have nowadays, together with chronic inflammation.\n\nLow-carb, ketogenic, fasting, carnivore... All works wonders for your mental health (as backed by science) because they simply cut carbs.\n\nYou think it will help with my anger issues\n\nCertainly. Practicing mindfulness should lead to some space between you and the anger, at the very least..I think meditating will help you breathe and be able to pause before exploding. You may still get angry, but that pause can really mitigate the affects.\n\nMy anger issues have been significantly reduced after practicing metta for several months. In the beginning it was horrible. But after some time of persistent practice I started getting the results - increase of positive mood. I think you need to start with metta before attempting breadth meditation.\n\nI was just about to post a question about meditation for anxiety. Sometimes, I get high anxiety which creates this knot in my chest. This knot informs me that I am anxious, which makes me more anxious. My surroundings start to become a blur and I forget where I am at times. Interacting with other people has been the best way to help me bring me back to reality. But once I'm alone, I become afraid that my anxiety will come back, which invites the anxiety to return.   \n  \nI have learned that one way to help me with this is to separate my anxious thoughts from my core self. I just started doing this tonight, following advice from a short youtube video. It does help. But I was wondering if you know of a specific meditation practice I can start doing to train this. How much meditation did you need to do before you reached this? If I don't get a response, I will post this as a separate question. It does feel weird to see yourself in 3rd person, and I cannot help but judge myself for that. It's like seeing myself within myself within myself.\n\nHonestly that‚Äôs what helped. I just became a spectator of my thoughts rather than fully thinking about them if that makes sense. As soon as a thought pops in my head I mentally take note of what it was about and then quiet my mind again. That‚Äôs when you realize that all the thoughts are just random things your brain is creating, and you can tell it to stop. I was only able to do this about 15 minutes in when I was fully relaxed and in the zone.\n\nSo it wasn't through a guided meditation or anything? You just meditated in silence on your own? Becoming a spectator is definitely easier said than done. And when I have a huge knot in my chest and stomach (from anxiety), it's hard to relax. I did consider what you said about it being a muscle, so I tried to relax the knots like they were muscles.\n\nMe too dude :) x\n\nGood for you. Honestly sleep and being aware of the moment is all you need.\n\nSame here. If i go a day without it now i feel like something is missing and the negativity starts lingering.\n\nHow long did this take? I am 2.3 months ish into daily 30 minute meditation and have noticed a big reduction in anxiety from a very very high starting point but I'm still pretty far from being cured.\n\nI‚Äôm about 2 months in. I have found that the quality of meditation is more important than the time of meditation. Sometimes it may take me 30 minutes to fully get in the zone and some days I can do it in 10. Just keep it up it will keep getting better\n\nHow do you meditate? Do you use an app? How it is going for u?\n\nI really enjoy the app Insight Timer. It has a free and paid version, though the app makes you sign up for a 7-day free trial. The free version has tons of guided meditations of various lengths and topics. I highly recommend it.\n\nYou don't need an app to literally do nothing. \n\nTbh I fell off a bit after making that post but plan to be more consistent in new year. Focus on breath or a candle or something and when your focus switches to something else notice and our it back on the thing you are focusing on.\n\nDo an hour maybe? I don't start noticing the effects until after 20 minutes. So a 30 minute meditation is really only 10 with a 20 min warm-up.\n\nAlso cut sugar from diet.\n\nReally? This is interesting. How is sugar related to anxiety? Thank you.\n\nCaffeine too.\n\nYep\n\nMeditation cured my suicidal depression\n\nHappy for you\n\nThat's so cool to read\n\nNoticed the same thing and also that I‚Äôm almost always stomach gripping.\n\nCan you share links of the meditations you follow?\n\nI just used some guided meditations for positive energy on YouTube to learn how to meditate. Now i just use a meditation music video and do it myself. No particular video I just find a new one everyday.\n\nMindfulness changed my life for the better.. it does work for me personally.. I mean it is reality that the weather has to change at some point and so do emotions and everything else in life... That small teaching really helped me remove a lot of negative and self sabotaging ways of thought..\n\nWow. That never happened to me.\n\nThat's real progress in meditation. Our mind is united with our material body. So if you have dealt with some anxiety on a mental plane, physical level should follow.\n\nThis really keeps up my hope that I can use meditation to calm my anxiety as well!\n\nReading this was very encouraging. I'm working on how my anger affects my body. It feels tense, almost locked up, especially my feet and my jaw for whatever reason. I've been able to create the space between me and my anger with mindfulness, but now I'm working on letting it go. That's my current hurdle, letting it go. Any advice or details on how y'all have done that?\n\nI have more experience with progressive relaxation than meditation, and I too have noticed anxiety, and irritability fade as I relax certain muscles. The tense muscles are often in my throat, jaw, and even my tongue. I have yet to discover the racing thought \"muscle\" but I never focused on finding it. My thoughts usually stop racing during the relaxation.\n\nThis is really interesting, is it a specific type of meditation?\n\nYes it‚Äôs mainly mindfulness\n\nI would like to say I‚Äôm a 63 yr older F who‚Äôs had major Trauma, PTSD, sexual, emotional and physical abuse. I‚Äôve been free of this finally at 61 years old. Meditation üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è is never to replace any treatment you‚Äôre receiving via a Psychiatrist &amp; Therapist. Genetics üß¨ plays a role in our brain chemistry so does more importantly Developmental trauma making it difficult for a quick fix.  Do not go off prescribed medications especially those for sleep. \n\nGo to Utube ‚ÄúTrishula Kriya or Tershula Kriya Meditation with Sierra Siri Prakash Bullock.\nThis meditation will absolutely strengthen your ‚Äúparasympathetic nervous system‚Äù over time. It‚Äôs very difficult to do in the beginning so just focus on your breathing and the breath holds. It‚Äôs baby steps for most of us. \n\nIt can take months before you feel any difference or you will get to that state of calm and peace once and like myself not stick with it. That‚Äôs normal don‚Äôt beat yourself up just go back and start again. Those of us with MDD, GAD, PTSD and Insomnia are compassionate, kind, giving and loving individuals and yes we have a gift \nit‚Äôs called helping others, that‚Äôs our drug and it‚Äôs a good one.\n\nExercise every day or as much as possible needs to be part of any wellness plan. Eating healthy too ie high protein foods, less carbs stay off of sugar and white flour as best you can. That‚Äôs a gradual process too. If you‚Äôre a coffee addict which I am, limit to one cup early in the morning.  Second cup is decaffeinated again in the morning. No caffeine whatsoever after 12 noon. I say limit your alcohol intake and other drink with friends or some sort of celebration. Never drink alone. Alcohol is a depressant will make you feel sicker quicker depression gets worse. .

    "all_comment_text": "I 100% respect everyone's right to meditate however they want, and have their own views about it.\n\nBut for me personally, that is the only real meditation.\n\nI think earplugs are okay, eye mask etc. sitting seems better but laying down is okay if you don't sleep. Otherwise sitting in silence is the full experience.\n\nI still enjoy a guided meditation, meditation music, binural / isochronic stuff etc at times. It has benefits, and if you can't sit in silence it is better than nothing.\n\nSitting in silence seems like this horrible thing to a lot of people, but you adjust. It doesn't just get easier, it becomes a very blissful &amp; recharging state.\n\nUltimately the key is letting go and just being for a while, if that makes sense. It is almost too elemental for words.\n\nJust been listening to Krishnamurti talk about this yesterday, how we have made a whole ordeal out of meditation, when the whole point of it is LETTING GO, and not manipulating your own experience to be calm and blissful in whichever way, with different postures, sounds, mantras, and so on. Meditation happens when there is no movement from point A to point B, but precisely in the moment of letting go of all intention to achieve an XYZ state.\n\nYou end up just...being.\n\nI still think letting go and being in a variety of ways is helpful because it cultivates that awareness in different situations while doing different sorts of things.\n\nYeah, for sure. Unless you are fully enlightened you will not be able to maintain a single state of being in every situation, but I think over time It becomes easier to tap into higher awareness even in \" chaotic circumstances \". That's what It means to carry meditation with you wherever you go, at least from my understanding.\n\nExactly this.\n\nIt seems to me that every single technique is just a stepping stone towards this general perspective, and must eventually be released, that one may eventually maintain their meditation practice at all times, regardless of the work at hand.\n\n&gt; that one may eventually maintain their meditation practice at all times\n\nfor me, it's more so that it tends to blur with everything else\n\nwhat is and isn't meditation is just pure judgement of the mind\n\nPure judgement is only a tool, neither right nor wrong, while impure judgment quickly becomes a master, yes?\n\nYup. I started with techniques and now am in the middle of letting go of all techniques. Attachment to techniques holds you back. It‚Äôs basically like having training wheels. But eventually you need to ride without the training wheels.\n\n‚ÄúLet go of the meditator.‚Äù\n\nWould this be what some people call, a do nothing meditation?\n\n[deleted]\n\nNo. I‚Äôve been meditating for years and enhancing the experience with the singing bowls sounds. I can get to where I need to be and enjoy the healing sounds at the same time.\n\nPerson didn't say manipulating is always bad, tho.\n\nI love this passage from Autobiography of a Yogi (which is Steve Jobs' favorite book):\n\n&gt;Sri Yukteswar taught me how to summon the blessed experience at will, and also how to transmit it to others if their intuitive channels were developed. For months I entered the ecstatic union, comprehending why the Upanishads say God is rasa , \"the most relishable.\" \n\n&gt;One day, however, I took a problem to Master.\n\n&gt;\"I want to know, sir-when shall I find God?\"\n\n&gt;\"You have found Him.\"\n\n&gt;\"O no, sir, I don't think so!\"\n\n&gt;My guru was smiling. \"I am sure you aren't expecting a venerable Personage, adorning a throne in some antiseptic corner of the cosmos! I see, however, that you are imagining that the possession of miraculous powers is knowledge of God. One might have the whole universe, and find the Lord elusive still! Spiritual advancement is not measured by one's outward powers, but only by the depth of his bliss in meditation.\"\n\nI was just reading the other night about Jobs and his extracurricular activities after realizing that the symbol for Awen, before the NeoPags vandalized it, was a lot like that of the Atari (Syzygy) logo and falling into that hole.  Thanks.\n\n&gt; ‚ÄúOne might have the whole universe and find the lord illusive still‚Äù.\n\nHave you ever seen yourself without a mirror?\n\nSome books I‚Äôve read say don‚Äôt try to meditate. If you‚Äôre trying to meditate, you‚Äôre not meditating. Just let go of everything, your compulsions, your expectations, your techniques, and and sit very still in the absence of all that, and notice what is happening around you with all your senses. \n\nDoes not work for everybody, but it helps me to look at it like that.\n\nSounds like some short books haha, but I would like to read them.  Similarly, I do shut my eyes sometimes and hear the sounds around me for what they are and not to associate them with a name or description.  That‚Äôs about the only ‚Äúmethod‚Äù I‚Äôll use other than just to quiet the mind and observe.\n\nI feel like it‚Äôs about striking a balance between not trying and staying alert to yourself so you don‚Äôt drift away in thought. That‚Äôs why you need the techniques when you start, to learn to recognize when you get distracted, refocus etc.\n\nMe. Threw all that stuff out years ago. I used to be obsessed before that. Now I just sit with my own thoughts for a while every now and then. Sit until I feel at peace with myself and move on. It probably doesn't have all of the same benefits but I like it.¬†\n\nThoughts happen. It's what happens when they arise, it seems, that's the key to meditation.\n\n\"Sitting and forgetting,\" I think some Daoists call it.\n\nThis seems the way I‚Äôm going, however I think the technics can act as guides when time constraints are at play.\n\nYes.  I will say that time constraints don‚Äôt really have a grip on me as I‚Äôm a night owl and there aren‚Äôt really any demands outside myself when everything and everyone are in bed.\n\nThis is definitely true. Sometimes the guide is needed.\n\nAlmost every single time, and for me it works better than when I‚Äôve tried to do anything fancy.\n\nI think how a person meditates largely depends why a person is meditating\n\nIdk, it's like ignoring your music theory and musicianship just to free improv free-jazz. Meditation, conventionally, is like a totem. Know the ground, practice the path.\n\nThe techniques are to bring you back to the state you're talking about. In the practice I follow, they say to perform a silent sitting after each method, and if you enter a deep state to stay, rather than mechanically progress their the methods. \n\nThe purpose of meditation is deepening the state of your consciousness, not to get good at the techniques. \n\nFurther, they say that to end meditation after performing techniques without taking time to sit in stillness is like milking a cow, then immediately kicking over the bucket.\n\n100%. I happened upon it through learning about zen and I'll never go back to breathing or mantra meditation. Focusing on an object was both boring and fruitless for me. At best it made me calmer. But just sitting and *simply existing* without doing anything at all can be so incredibly profound and liberating, and really opens the field to percieve what is always there but usually not attuned to.\n\nI do both, depending on what I‚Äôm feeling (just sit silently, or sometimes use techniques and content). Both work for me.\n\nI would argue its more important to do what works for you than it is to do a set of techniques just because your \"supposed\" to.\n\nNever had enough technique to throw out the window.  I just enjoy sitting and zoning out.  My mind will be playfull and chaotic for awhile and I just enjoy that.... following thoughts and feelings without forcing or guiding.  Then after about an hour, the thoughts tire themselves out, but awareness is still there.  Then it's a quiet awareness without thought and it's awesome.  Patience.\n\nIs it possible that using those techniques is what's allowed you to meditate the way you are now?  Maybe they're like steps you had to take to get there, eg. I have been counting breaths but recently feel like just lying there without moving gets me there without the need for counting\n\nThis too is how I feel about it\n\nMe too\n\nI use breath and posture as my warm up, my cue to myself that I'm about to take time with myself to let go. I extend my out breath, OM into my chakras, all just little rituals to help my slide into the space where eventually....I'm just sitting peacefully for a while. Sometimes I drop right into it within minutes, other times it's just not going to happen for me. That's the sum of my meditation practice tho, ease myself into simply 'taking rest'. It's quite beautiful.\n\nMeditation is whatever you make it!\n\nYeah I can mediate while driving or working with my hands and not talking better than any intense methods you see online\n\nI either meditate like that or by just laying down silently\n\nIsn't that a \"technique \" in itself? Zen meditation\n\nIf you're able to silence your mind as you described, no other techniques or practices are required. Why would even such question arise? Now, when you meditate do you remain aware when the mind ceases to be active and remains still? Or you are not aware but infer that the mind was still after it becomes active again? The former is better but the latter is ok too. Either way, you're on your way, carry on, congrats.\n\nI can‚Äôt say I remain aware because I don‚Äôt really feel that way when I first sit down for all the chatter/noise going on in my head.  But all that will cease and I become very aware of the moment I‚Äôm in.  I had questioned because I felt I might be missing out on something for lack of discipline in ceasing to use the techniques used of getting there.\n\nYup. I‚Äôve always said this. As someone else rightly put; ‚ÄúI am  nothing, want nothing and expect nothing. I‚Äôm here to just observe‚Äù.\n\nThe Quakers do this. They have meetings every Sunday morning where they just sit in silence.\n\nMy meditation instructor said that she was just offering me a plate of fruit and I should pick what I liked. Meaning, if something doesn't work for me, drop it. She said it doesn't matter what we  focus our awareness on, as long as we're doing it.\n\nI was meditating for many years before I ever applied anything like what I would call technique. \n\nThe conventional idea of discipline can set you back pretty far in meditation. \n\nEvery person struggling with meditation is someone trying to force someone else's understanding of something that only they can come to understand themselves.\n\nThrew technique, stopped posting and commenting here.\n\nThat‚Äôs what I do I just silently sit and breathe most of the time.  Gives a bit of a break or an avenue for the mind to empty out all its junk.\n\nüôã\n\nSame here, only difference is I like to stand in silence so I don't feel drowsy.\n\nOfcourse it's gonna be shorter session than sitting but I found it helps üôÇ.\n\nNot to mention the gains in posture too.\n\nYup. I‚Äôve always said this. As someone else rightly put; ‚ÄúI am  nothing, want nothing and expect nothing. I‚Äôm here to just observe‚Äù.\n\nIn my opinion technique and intellectual understanding is only to be used UNTIL you can just sit silently. The more thoughts going on in your head, the less meditation is happening. Just my opinion\n\nGreat advice, this has occurred for me, without analysis or effort. The effort was continuing to meditate and this happened. üôèüèª\n\nIt's a good place to start   ;)\n\nI have.\nI felt that i was being taught from within you start to pickup technique posture breathing etc etc.. you feel the prefrontal cortex at work and learn to naturally place your tongue and focus on the pineal etc etc. someone found it out just by meditating with no outside guide. I personlly know for myself that i had a deep inner sense of knowing of what meditation was before knowing meditation.\n\nYou're just following your past lives. This gave you a good base. Lean into it, but remain open to new experiences. You're doing nothing wrong.\n\nYes, after I studied the 4 noble truths and tried to dissect all the things one can be attached to, it occurred to me that sitting and essentially slipping into a 100% void is a move in the right direction so to speak. Because where does one focus? Sound? Thought? Feeling? Emotion? Sight? Consciousness itself? Effort? Awareness seems to always ‚Äúland‚Äù ‚Äúsomewhere‚Äù and then once a ‚Äúsomething‚Äù is identified all I can do is let it go and repeat over and over into what seems like sliding into another dimension.\n\ni found out by just doing nothing for a while during the pandemic¬†\n\nThis is actually a kind of meditation that is taught. I call it, flowing Shinzen Young, \"Do Nothing\" meditation.¬† I've been teaching this kind of meditation for years. You can find a talk I gave explaining the nature and benefits of this kind of practice here:\n\n\n\n\n¬†https://insighttimer.com/luischiesa/guided-meditations/ten-minute-talk-do-nothing-the-cant-go-wrong-meditation¬†\n\n\nBest of luck in your practice....\n\nThe link doesn‚Äôt work\n\nCould you reply with the working link Ty ty\n\nOsho once said \"A master is not someone who has accomplished anything great.  A master is one who knows that there is nothing to accomplish\".\n\nThe ultimate goal of meditation is something that most of us will never master and that is to go \"beyond  technique\".\n\nWhatever technique we use it is just a preparation.. after that short period of preparation..( 5 or 10 or 15 minutes) you need to just forget about the technique.. your aims.. expectations etc and just sit in silence .. receptive .. completely passive and let an inner power / state take over ‚Ä¶\n\nI do what works:\n\n- Breathe with the diaphragm.\n\n- Be aware of the vagus nerve.\n\n- Proper tongue position.\n\nYes.\n\nNone. I already have been meditating for years when i first heard about the word and so that what i do has a name and commonly known. I have never read techniques. Even further, for years i thought techniques are description of self-progress like i used to do. Realizing they are shallow \"techniques\" mainly focusing on primitive attention and the body was sad for me.\n\nI also kinda never just sat in silence. Even when i did things what could be named as such, they are tremendiously and essentially way different than as others did tend to describe it.\n\nThat's meditation, homes\n\nI was introduced to the idea of meditation as 'shikantaza', which my instructor explained as 'just sitting.' Of all the various types of meditation this one appealed to me most initially, so it's the one I tend to favor.  I've done other forms of moving meditation and stuff over the years which I also like, but there's something really special about just sitting that I tend to come back to.\n\nSimple is better, but my mind would never shut up if I didn't actively do something to try to quiet it.\n\nIt does take me awhile at times.  Sometimes I‚Äôll be there in a couple minutes, other times I‚Äôll catch my mind having thoughts and having to reign it back in many times before it shuts up and that can take like thirty minutes on occasion.\n\nMe.  Guided meditations are just distracting, and I can‚Äôt really hit that calm state unless I sit in silence.\n\nBest to firt focus on consistency. After a few months maybe add in techniques.\n\nThis is the way, gimmicks distract. Although i have good results with chanting to get in a trance like state.\n\nHonestly, I've never meditated without using a technique. Most of the time, I use guided meditations, but sometimes I will focus on my breath or use finger tapping. but this has motivated me to give it a try. Lol As I am typing this, I can already feel my anxiety and doubt. LOL.\n\nI tried everything, I just picture a orange sphere and focus on it as if it is in the middle of my brain now. Really silly, but easiest for me to visualize to think of nothing until I can.\n\nthis is all i do, when i was first getting into meditation all of the different techniques were a bit overwhelming. when i sit with a clear mind for so long and finally open my eyes, i feel an amazing sense of clarity!!\n\nMaybe some Daoism can help understand here, people in the West take everything way too directly, and then take into consideration text and translations over thousands of years. A lot got lost, or changed intentionally.\n\nYou don't actually hyperfocus with active mind on the breath. You let your brain go silent, and \"sink\" into the sensation of the breath. You become the breath. Every its movement, sensation, you feel it all through your body and mind, and like a wave, follow along.\n\nShikantaza‚Ä¶ just sitting.\n\nYou don‚Äôt hold your tongue to roof of mouth. It is supposed to naturally sit there.\n\nThanks\n\nOne thing I always think of is that your experience is your experience.  And what helps me, might not help you.\n\nFor example, while at a meditation retreat, one individual wouldn‚Äôt stop moving, they were impatient.  Being talked to and reminded to calm down and don‚Äôt move along with encouragement worked for them.  But for me, I found this aggravating as I prefer silence and just one word would help me focus.  \n\nSo find what it is that works for you and practice that.\n\nOnly read your title question before replying, simply because I can answer the question from my side: I have.\n\nI still enjoy different approaches, they diminish nothing. But primarily I sit.\n\nI have a mantra that a meditation teacher gave me -- it isn't a word, just a series of sounds. I use that to focus on (instead of the breath or whatever). I find that useful. But ultimately the best meditation is the one that works for you and that you'll stick with. So if your technique is not a formally recognized one, but your practice is helping you, then that's great! Not a disservice if it's effective for you. Just my $.02\n\nI think this is it. I always run through techniques in my head and eventually remind myself to just sit. Nothing more.\n\nThis is it! \n\nI started meditating about 4 years ago and this was how I started, it was actually by mistake. I was having a day and decided to sit in my car and just zone out. No social media to distract just silence. After a few minutes of just ‚Äúbeing‚Äù the room (my mind) just stopped. It was a little unsettling because it was the first time I hadn‚Äôt heard my mind. It felt like I was outside my body. This was my first spiritual awakening experience, I‚Äôll never forget it.  \n\nNow I‚Äôm consistently in a meditative state unless life gets a little chaotic then I have to work a little harder to stay there.\n\nYup you do you as you see fit.\n\nthis is the way üëç\n\nall human language is an artificial construct, not native to nature\n\nmy most calming, focusing, centering, relaxing, meditations are always thoughtless meditations\n\njust be...turn off all the internal monologues and everything for a few moments and...just be\n\nit's like making the world actually stop spinning for a little while\n\nYES YES YES ... I say this all of the time. \n\nI also say \"follow the proscribed path, get the expected results.\" I prefer to find my own path and be surprised by what I discover. :)\n\nThat's me. Still working in techniques.\n\nInterestingly this is an age old debate where, as I understand it, Theravada Buddhists have been obsessed with techniques and ‚Äòmapping‚Äô meditation development in a logical way, whereas Zen Buddhists threw away all that and so the techniques tend to be simpler/less intellectual, but more indirect and obtuse. Different strokes for different folks.\n\nI remember when I first started studying under my meditation master and I asked him what I‚Äôm supposed to‚Äùdo‚Äù when I get in the meditative state. \n\nHe just laughed at me the way wise old people laugh. \n\nTo get into a meditative state you quite literally have to ‚Äúdo‚Äù nothing but breathe. Once you‚Äôve cleared your mind and altered your mental state, the goal is to exercise the muscle of being rather than doing. See how long you can go follow the breath rather than the thoughts. Keep trying to go longer. Take that presence and effort with you through your daily life.\n\nSilence is one of the aspects of the Natural State of Mind or Nature of Mind.   Sitting in Silence is one of the highest meditative states, but it's more of a non-meditation or resting in What Is.\n\nI like to imagine myself sitting in an empty dark void except for the light above me that casts a silhouette\n\nThere are so many ways to still the mind. Basic all the way to complex. You do what works for you. And sometimes, that thing that works varies from day to day, each season of your life, or for specific times. Use what works. Don't get attached to any one method, because life teaches us the value and the way of impermanence.\n\nI've recently, in the last few years, found a new connection with \"God\", whatever that is, and now, when I sit down to meditate, I spend a few minutes talking with God, and then I let my mind run out of things to say. I believe that this is the purest form of prayer. No effort, just let things go quiet and let God in, to calm my \"fevered brow\".\n\nSame. \n\nI personally don‚Äôt think sitting and focusing on your breath has any real meaning or ability to enlighten us beyond any normal experience.\n\nAgreed in that it all distracts me from what really needs focused on, and that‚Äôs an empty mind from what I understand.  I can either focus on relaxing a body part at a time, then breathing, then letting go, etc.  or just letting thoughts pass until nothing. I particularly find that the relaxing of the body/release of tension comes right along with the chatter ceasing without even having to consciously trying to make relaxation happen.\n\nEdit:  in fact, it seems like many of the ‚Äústeps‚Äù in a by the book meditation seem to just happen on their own when I go straight to silence.  Another example is that the breath slows on its own and becomes more rhythmic/relaxed/deeper\n\nYeah, like scientifically meditation is great for a number of things. But there‚Äôs no scientific backing for enlightenment or these other spiritual mumbo jumbo that meditation is surrounded by. \n\nBut I also value supportable beliefs a whole lot and a there‚Äôs a bunch of people that simply would rather believe in enlightened states of mind and higher powers. None of which are supported by any real evidence\n\nThe focus on your breath is just to find the quiet. The rabbit hole is bottomless.\n\nanything can be yoga.\n\nWhat you describe is garden variety reverie. It may make you feel more relaxed. Sitting back and breathing deeply for a couple of minutes can do similar.\n\nThis really depends on what you want. Do you want to relax? Then you're fine. Meditation is not a way to relax. It's mind training. Most popular meditation is borrowed from Buddhism and taken out of context. Then it gets presented as help for insomnia or weight training for the brain.\n\nIf you're really meditating then it will arguably be the hardest work you've ever done, because it involves disciplining the mind. Normally we'd never think to control what we allow ourselves to think about. Even if you work shovelling out horse stables, you can still wear headphones and fantasize about having sex with a rockstar. You barely have to be where you are. People do that all day long, espceially now with earbuds and cellphones. But with meditation we actually decide not to let the mind simply wander from one association to the next.\n\nYou could think of it like taking a dog for a walk. With meditation, when the dog gets distracted and starts to chase after a bird or a discarded half donut, you pull gently on the leash and bring it back to the walking path. Over time, the dog is trained to pay attention. That''s basic meditation. Another approach might be to leave the dog in a big yard. It will then run around until it gets bored. You're choosing the second approach, which is essentially just relaxation and subtle reverie. There is no \"deep\". Successful meditation is practicing awake, here and now.\n\nThere's a well known story about that. A student went to a Zen master and asked him how to practice meditation. The teacher answered that it's the practice of attention. The student asked what he meant by attention. The teacher answered, \"Attention is attention!\"\n\nLots of people practice some kind of technique with the goal of feeling better afterward. Sometimes that works pretty well. Usually it just has a temporary effect. \n\nPersonally I don't think the practices are realistic without the guidance of a teacher. Any meditation is subtle and easy to do wrong. It's very easy, once the novelty wears off, to just space out and think you've meditated. It's very easy to calmly think about \"spiritual\" topics and then imagine you've meditated.\n\n[deleted]\n\nI'm curious why you think reaching a meditative state through silent surrender is lesser? As someone who uses both techniques and just sitting, I see no difference, and honestly feel like I go deeper sometimes with silent surrender.\n\n[deleted]\n\nI'm assuming the OP, seeming to have experience with the meditative experience, isn't just sitting and thinking. I'm not sure anyone's arguing that that's correct meditation.  Meditation is the practice of surrendering to the present and some techniques can help you to distract the mind enough to find that but they're not necessary to find that state, especially if you've used techniques in the past to the point that you understand the different states. I feel like you might have misunderstood what OP meant by just sitting.\n\nI think that the difference between let the mind wander and chasing the thoughts is the key in that. Normally we tend to follow and ruminate for a while on the majority of the thoughts that come across our mind, when one meditates would just observe them without lingering on them, coming back on the present moment (sensations, sounds, visual.. etc) until they, now weakened, don't even make the effort anymore to appear and they will let the mind in peace.   \nThat's a technic that psychologists teach also to emerge from the tunner of OCD. :)\n\nSure\n\nMe\n\nI don‚Äôt consider breathing to be a ‚Äútechnique‚Äù. It‚Äôs something that happens automatically that the body does to keep itself alive\n\nI think it can go even further than that. You don't need to be silent or in quiet and you don't need to sit, you just need to observe, which allows you to take meditation into all contexts\n\nI mean yeah I think the majority of people who regularly meditate do that\n\nBut the general goal is come to the realization that there is no difference or barrier between a meditative state and reality. You aren‚Äôt adding a behavior to the mix by meditating. You are subtracting everything else\n\nWhen I got into it I quickly noticed that most of what is referred to as meditation is either escapism, distraction or just a whole lot of nothing. \n\nSo I just started experimenting and seeing where it takes me, what sort of meditation I come up with. \n\nTurns out it is somewhat related to mindfulness meditation, something you can do anywhere at any time without stopping what you‚Äôre otherwise doing. Makes the most sense to me since training in isolation won‚Äôt be very helpful when faced with all of reality.\n\nall well and good to say that but to actually achieve that state is another thing, even with a technique it can still seem or be impossible for some. \n\nthe only real technique is concentration of the breath and refocusing back to it after distraction this allows you to essentially have nothing in your mind. by committing to the technique you retrain the habit pattern of your mind to stay focused and not distracted for longer, ultimately ending up with having nothing in your mind for longer, effortlessly. which is pretty damn good if you are just trying to ‚Äúbe‚Äù.\n\n\ntrying to get to just ‚Äúpure being‚Äù by the sheer will of it could work for some, but the average person and their current state of mind will most likely find that route impossible. thats why techniques exist. and they do work.\n\nAgree.  I have tried many forms of meditation, and the meditation that has taken me to stillness is a breathing meditation.  I have actually reached the stillness with breathing meditation.\n\nIf meditation isn't working for you then try consciously rewiring your brain during the day.

They also found that the students didn‚Äôt enjoy the sessions and didn‚Äôt practice at home.\n\n&gt;Another explanation is that mindfulness training could encourage ‚Äúco-rumination,‚Äù the kind of long, unresolved group discussion that churns up problems without finding solutions.\n\n&gt;As the MYRIAD results were being analyzed, Dr. Andrews led an evaluation of¬†[Climate Schools, an Australian intervention](https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/ytdsj)¬†based on the principles of cognitive behavioral therapy, in which students observed cartoon characters navigating mental health concerns and then answered questions about practices to improve mental health.\n\n&gt;Here, too, he found negative effects. Students who had taken the course reported higher levels of depression and anxiety symptoms six months and 12 months later.\n\nIt's quite disheartening to see the results of this study. What do you think are reasons for such negative results?",

    "all_comment_text": "A huge factor could be that these were school programs. Having a bunch of random teenagers take a few mindfulness classes in school might not be the optimal way or setting for them to learn about and practice meditation. Seeking out meditation yourself and practicing it in your own way is very different from sitting in a building you're forced to be in and following some prepackaged mindfulness training protocol designed to be implemented on a mass scale across schools.\n\nNot to mention the line, at the very top:\n\n&gt; students didn‚Äôt enjoy the sessions and didn‚Äôt practice at home.\n\nSo they just sat there bored and were waiting for it to be over. \n\nThat doesn't sound like there was much 'mindfulness' happening.\n\nMore like practicing empty mindedness.\n\nSo, your basic teenage life experience then.\n\nSource: was once a teenager\n\nMost of my days at school lol, waiting for it to be over\n\nAsshole!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNah, you right tho.\nSource: was also a teenager once\n\nif they were practicing empty mindedness, then maybe they would've actually enjoyed it lol\n\nlol ok that makes this entire study useless\n\nYeah, compartmentalization of your meditation practice to the cushion is just going to eventually make that practice part of the problem.\n\nYup as a child my parents *forced me* to meditate, it felt like punishment and felt like I was doing it for my parents. \n\nI now voluntarily meditate and have found better results\n\nI was also forced to meditate for 30 minutes, when I was younger. I just sat there, waiting for the time to run out. Sometimes/mostly I just fell asleep.\n\nI look at it very much the same way I do physical exercise. I very much believe that it's important to find what niche appeals most to you. Weightlifting? Yoga? Calisthenics? Sprinting? I think that many people are forced to do something they don't enjoy, like running a mile in middle school, and then end up writing off all physical exercise. As with anything, the best exercise is the one that keeps you coming back. If it's a 30 minute walk that gets you out of the door then great. Personally I really don't care about weightlifting or running (which it seems most people do), but have found a lot of passion in things like calisthenics, yoga, climbing, volleyball, etc.\n\nI think meditation is similar, in that there are so many methods and approaches, and many of them just don't click. It's important to find what clicks with you, I think.\n\nI mean, if the meditation is pushed onto you, it's obviously not gonna be much good\n\nHonestly yes that's it. I had a meditation course in university and only chose it because I was guaranteed to get a good grade with little to no effort. I didn't want to mediate and it didn't do shit for me.\n\nNow I have found my way to meditation personally and it's a huge difference in the way I approach, cherish and enjoy that time.\n\nKinda like therapy, I know so many people who say therapy did nothing for them(myself included) that werent even remotely open to it vs later on finding it on their own and enjoying it fully\n\nWait, you mean an optional extra-curricular course, or an actual course you get a grade and credits for? I'd like to know what college major involves having to learn meditation!\n\nHaha it was a prep course for an internship at a school. The internship itself got 6 credits. The prep course was mandatory but some were a lot of work and other were, well, meditation. I'm studying to become a teacher\n\nAt Maharishi International University, every major has an initial class requirement that has meditation taught.  Most people don‚Äôt seem to mind, even if they don‚Äôt meditate regularly. Not sure if it helps as much as people say yet, though I figure having to sit down and relax is kinda nice for a class requirement.\n\nWhen it becomes this ‚Äúthing‚Äù that you are just at peace with. Took me about 25 years to come full circle myself.\n\nI believe meditation is not very useful by itself without a deeper understanding or exploration of the fundamental concepts about the nature of consciousness. Distracting yourself from thought by paying attention to breathing does not help without understanding how to observe vs engage in thought. It can be a great tool, but like all tools must be wielded with skill.\n\nAnd I would add that meditation (and adjacent Buddhist principles) are a practice and philosophy of mind. I tried meditation for decades and it did nothing for me. And indeed, I often felt it merely encouraged negative rumination. It wasn‚Äôt until I started to learn and consider the underlying science and philosophy of consciousness that I started reaping the benefits, which have been nothing short of profoundly, positively impactful. And I came to the project deeply skeptical, so I don‚Äôt believe my own awakening required ‚Äúbelief,‚Äù just practice and, most importantly, study and contemplation, both of which are clearly missing from these studies.\n\nCould you please recommend a book that would go deeper into the fundamental concepts about the nature of consciousness?\n\nThe untethered soul is great as well.\n\nThanks, just ordered\n\nThat book is amazing. I really enjoyed it as an audiobook to do a chapter at a time while driving or going for a walk!  \n\nThe follow up book, Living Untethered, should be read/listened to as well. It expands on all the ideas of the first and goes into ‚Äúhow‚Äù to do so. Plus, the author is the voice actor for the 2nd book, and has a wonderful, soft voice.\n\n‚ÄòThe mindful way through depression‚Äô is a great read for beginners &amp; it takes an evidence based approach\n\nThank you...just ordered\n\nRupert Spira - The Nature of Consciousness\n\nThis was the book that changed my understanding of my self.\n\n- Sam Harris - Waking Up\n\nJust ordered, thank you\n\nEnjoy. And read slowly would be my advice haha. Ponder on everything you read. This book won't dramatically overturn your pre-conceived notions about consciousness in one go, but maybe it will be the catalyst for your path towards true mindfulness.\n\nI'm not one to start shilling for someone else but Sam's meditation app also called \"Waking Up\" has been a life changer for me. I've currently got 7,351 minutes of engagement on it, 5,554 of which are in active meditation, spread out over 162 active days. That's not to brag but to genuinely endorse this thing that has uprooted my entire existence.\n\nIt's a meditation app but also a hub for rational spiritual teachers to share their guided meditations and other related content that I've been actively engaging with every single day since I got it. Life changing stuff.\n\nHe also grants massive discounts for financially strained people. I also took this chance and paid a little less than full price, something more befitting of my income. Otherwise I would've missed out on the greatest opportunity of my life. If you really engage with the app, read the book and resolve to really learn more about consciousness, it is priceless.\n\nHe also gives it away for free if you really can't afford it. No questions asked. The ethics of this guy's product alone tells me he's on to something.\n\nAnyway, sorry for the word vomit. I really hope it can be of use because I'm really adamant everyone should start their journey towards mindfulness. I tried many times but with this book, and the app, it finally fucking stuck. And I think it will work for others too. Sam's approach is perfect for any rational thinker.\n\nThank you, inspiring\n\nI have been using it almost daily for 5,5 years now and I also highly recommend it. It's quite a different approach to mindfulness and to meditation apps than any others I've tried.\n\nneurodharma\n\nThe power of now by eckhart tolle is also really enlightening\n\nBeautifully said\n\nThis exactly. üëç\n\nThe mind that created the problem can't solve it without changing.  If this doesn't produce sustainable change then it's a good data that informs people about a method that didn't work.\n\nLook at it from another perspective. How many people genuinely find meditation out of curiosity or spiritual pursuit? I'd say the vast majority are in the boat of these students, it's just something people hear about for their positive effects. People want \"hot fixes\" and instant \"brain hacks\" to achieve said effects. And if it's not that, we live in a culture where we think if we just try harder and be ultra disciplined eventually they will arrive at their goal. Which in essence misses the point of meditation and overdoes it...\n\nMeditation is an inner journey where we explore and learn to navigate our inner world. Nothing more, nothing less. Our preconceived notions about it's benefits like \"enlightenment\" and positive mental health get in the way of this. It's no surprise at all this study came up with the results it did. Especially considering the methods used\n\nWhere did is say it was ‚Äúpushed‚Äù onto them? It‚Äôs unethical to force someone to participate in a study. \n\nThe excerpt says they didn‚Äôt enjoy the sessions and didn‚Äôt practice at home, but they still presumably entered and continued with the intervention voluntarily.\n\nDon't get too caught up on the words I used. The students didn't enjoy the sessions and didn't practice at home. Whatever you want to call the chain of cause and effect led to that being the case is obviously a problem with the approach.\n\nThis is all speculation. It's possible what you're saying is true but in reality we don't know, I wouldn't hold tightly to any of the speculations here\n\nThey didn‚Äôt practice at home is not speculation. And that‚Äôs the key detail. Mindfulness is more or less useless if you are getting a handful of sessions. Regular daily practice is the real benefit.¬†\n\nThat‚Äôs not true though is it. You can hate cardio and still get positive effects from it you can dislike therapy and still get positive effects. You can dislike the way antidepressants make you feel and still note a symptom reduction when on them. \n\nI think you‚Äôre dismissing this finding because you don‚Äôt like it rather than accepting that meditation might not be as potent or reliable an intervention as many on this sub might want it to be.\n\nthe emphasis on mindfulness comes from buddhism. in buddhist practice, mindfulness is one tool among many. you want to build a beautiful, happy mind? then you need more than one tool.\n\nour minds are conditioned by peers, society, self-view, and countless other influences. if these influences are unpleasant and unwholesome, our inner landscape is a mess.\n\nlooking at it every now and then for a few minutes won't change much. it just makes us realize we're a mess. in my experience, it's only through widening our perspective to include the whole of spiritual practice that we have enough tools at our disposal to clear our inner landscape. your mind can become beautiful to the point where you'll find it hard to believe it.\n\nbut mindfulness alone just won't take you there. it's like a horse with one leg.\n\nThis. I saw a comment in a similar thread on yoga recently, saying it was unfortunate that people keep trying to sell it as a cure when it's just a tool to give you a fighting chance.\n\nI hate these articles that try to \"debunk\" a single, potentially helpful intervention as a false cure-all.\n\nThe research is done for 8 years. What I'm worried is they took the wrong mindfulness method as opposed to the way of the Buddha.\n\nWhat I mean by that is, there are so many meditation methods that borrow the term mindfulness because it's the trend.\n\n\"Watch the thoughts arise and dissipate. To understand that everything is impermanence, so stop clinging onto the thoughts and feelings,\" those are the standard practice of modern mindfulness I've seen on YouTube.\n\nMeanwhile in Buddhism, we need to contemplate and relate the Buddha's Dhamma in regard to the experience we had. That's why it's necessary to have an experienced meditator who understand Dhamma to help in consulting the practitioners after each sessions.\n\nThat way, we can heal our traumas, pains, angers, and other baggages that we carried in our life.\n\nMindfulness is a tool.  You still gotta do the emotional, mental, shadow work.  The study is only verifying what we already know - spiritual growth goes hand in hand with personal growth.  Meditation and mindfulness were never intended to be a replacement.  But without being able to enter the witness the personal growth cannot happen.\n\nThat is exactly what I say. But I‚Äôm worried that the modern gurus talking about mindfulness while they actually meant something else similar.\n\nIt‚Äôs like a magnifying glass and microscope. Both can see small things, but one goes deeper, need more preparation, and training to use it properly.\n\nThen the mentor needs to guide what we see with the microscope. Which one is blood cells, organism, etc.\n\nJust like the real and proper mindfulness meditation, understanding how to deal with thoughts and traumas.\n\n&gt;¬†¬†the emphasis on mindfulness comes from buddhism Actually both dyana (basterdized as meditation / mindfulness) and yoga come from Sanatana Dharma. Which Buddhism is a branch of. These practices are far older than Buddhism.¬†\n\n[I made a similar post like that: here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExistentialJourney/comments/1besfa5/does_anyone_else_realize_we_will_never_be_okay/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\nOur life is not some entity that achieves emotional security, it's a moment-to-moment process. And like you pointed out these practices are tools not a cure, and these will never replace the active involvement it is in living one's life. Change also takes conscious self-awareness to integrate these unresolved parts of ourselves.\n\nFor me the question is what exact practice did they engage in and what was the frequency and length of it. The study states ‚ÄòThe SBMT involves 10 manualised, structured lessons (typically 30‚Äì50‚Äâmin each), normally delivered over one school term (either in the first or second year of secondary school).‚ÄôThe study explains that the content of the lessons only contains ‚Äòbrief‚Äô periods of meditation and a lot of the lesson is actually class discussion and skill learning. The study states home practice was extremely low. So effectively these children probably meditated ten times for about 10-15 minutes each, then they were asked a year later if it helped. That‚Äôs like doing 100 push ups in a week and expecting to be significantly changed for the better a year later.\n\nThe study even admits this:\n\n\n‚ÄòThe SBMT curriculum we used may simply not be intensive enough to create changes in the hypothesised mechanisms of enhancing attention and self-regulation skills, especially as we found that young people have very mixed views of the acceptability of SBMT, and largely did not practise the skills at home.‚Äô\n\nIn my perception of this study they gave short infrequent lessons for a short period of time to a captive audience who weren‚Äôt necessarily interested or engaged and then found that a year later there wasn‚Äôt improvement, I‚Äôm not surprised by the results.\n\nThis. It‚Äôs a bit like running a study to determine if the game of tennis (or insert your favorite challenging sport here) is enjoyable. Then select 10 people, hand them a racket, proceed to serve them 10 times each, and then survey them to ascertain if they ‚Äúenjoy tennis.‚Äù This is just extremely flawed science and quite frustrating to read.\n\nYeah this study is so pointless. Why would they study meditation this way? For 8 years?! They need to have people who are interested in meditation, but haven‚Äôt started yet, sign up and then take it seriously. Meditating daily. And actual mindfulness not just letting negative emotions arise and ruminating. Mindfulness can just be sitting with your body. I feel like whoever did this study does not actually meditate themselves.\n\nI think it wasn‚Äôt a study to assess meditation, but to assess whether including it in the school curriculum in this way was useful. Answer ‚Äòno‚Äô. Doesn‚Äôt really say anything about meditation beyond that.\n\nI see. Yeah this way was wrong. Try another way.  I feel like yoga with 15 mins of guided meditation at the end? That would be a better way to integrate the practice into schooling.\n\n&gt; They need to have people who are interested in meditation\n\nThey wouldn't do this because this introduces bias. You would want a representative sample.\n\nThis. The official MBCT or MBSR program is way more intensive. Eight weeks with a weekly session of approx. 2 hours. \n\nI thiught they already did a study last year with (middle/high) school children where the researchers concluded that mindfulness didn't have an effect?\n\nDo we have any conclusive large scale and long time study that supports the hypothesis that a different method or a more frequent approach would have a different outcome?\n\nhonestly there's not much research done on a long scale (for highly controlled studies)\n\nhttps://www.deanfrancispress.com/index.php/hc/article/view/544/HC001062.pdf\n\nhere is a recent literature review. \n\n\"Despite promising outcomes, the limited number of high-quality studies underscores the need for more comprehensive research.\"\n\nThanks, I'll give it a read. Since it began to get more popular in us/europe many years ago I find it a bit puzzling that it is still lacking more extensive research\n\nyeah there's thousands upon thousands of studies on the matter but it's hard to actually have very good high quality studies without lots of money and time (I'm sure there are many going on right now) \n\n\nhere's an interview you may find interesting by the guy who basically introduced mediation to modern science https://youtu.be/YC8FfQlNJV0\n\nThis is the right answer. Seems kind of crazy how improperly they conducted this study\n\nSeems to miss the key point that one must also learn to let go of difficult thoughts, to realise their transience, to work with them in a constructive way. The seems to be a study on brooding more than anything else\n\nYeah, that was my first thought here. Mindfulness to \"bring awareness to upsetting thoughts\" is not actually mindfulness at all. It's quite literally teaching kids to become attached to thoughts\n\nThis MYRIAD Project sounds like typical non-profit industrial complex nonsense that was designed to chase down grants and sell curriculums\n\nI‚Äôm confused. Bringing awareness to upsetting thoughts sounds a lot more like **Shadow Work** than mindfulness. Shadow work and mindfulness are very different things, you could almost say that they are the opposite of each other.\n\nI‚Äôve been practicing mindfulness for a long time and even went as far as to get my certification, and for me mindfulness has always been about being 100% in the moment. Paying attention to any thoughts that come up but not purposely thinking about ‚Äúupsetting‚Äù thoughts. For me mindfulness is about listening to the sounds in your environment, feeling the sun on your skin, observing thoughts without judgement etc. it‚Äôs a very peaceful practice.\n\nShadow work, on the other hand is very similar to what is described here. Meditating on upsetting thoughts, actually bringing those thoughts up. The difference with shadow work is that you actually work through those thoughts, you don‚Äôt just sit there thinking about them for no good reason.\n\nI think this study was dangerous and stupid. The researches didn‚Äôt ask the participants to practice mindfulness, they asked them to suffer without any progress, of course that is going to cause negative results.\n\nI‚Äôm actually disgusted to be honest. Shame on the researches for doing this to the participants.\n\nI don't think bringing awareness to unpleasant thoughts is the same as shadow work. It's a way to learn to relate to these thoughts in a more detached way so you remain as the watcher of those thoughts instead of getting too involved and dragged around by them. \n\nI consider this a form of mindfulness where you're using thoughts as the object of awareness just like you could use sounds, smells, the breath. \n\nFrom a psychology point of view, doing this is also a form of exposure to distressing thoughts which reduces the emotional intensity attached to those thoughts (habituation) and it also teaches you that you can tolerate distress instead of having to avoid it.\n\nYou just have to be sure not to be ruminating while you do this and just watch the thoughts \"passively\" so to speak.\n\nAs a practitioner of both, I understand both sides. Mindfulness is being present, that's correct. But thoughts do arise when we are trying to focus. That's where the term monkey mind comes from.\n\nAnd to some degree, traumatic incidents may also pops out of the still mind. Emotions might arise at that time. Without guidance, this emotions and thoughts might linger in the next session, waiting for a closure.\n\nThat‚Äôs when shadow work comes in. But shadow work itself, from my experience in the new age world, doesn‚Äôt heal the shadow. Instead, most throw it out from their soul and regard it as closure. How can you throw a part of you away?\n\nA lot of people who did shadow work never gets it done. Without proper knowledge on how to work on it, most of the practice only involves in ceremonial short term relieve.\n\nThat‚Äôs the reason why I recommend people to learn Early Buddhist Text (EBT) or Theravadan practice.\n\nSpeaking as a Catholic who has been meditating since childhood and had a fairly recent nervous breakdown brought about by tantric meditation triggering the piecing together of a fragmented childhood memory: you are absolutely correct in suggesting authentic Buddhist practices. They have been doing this sort of thing for a very long time, and those monks and nuns have seen some shit.\n\nEXTREMELY painful memories might suddenly arise without warning, and need to be dealt with properly. Sometimes they are too powerful for the meditator to handle alone, and it is perfectly fine to ask someone you trust for help.\n\nMany people think that \"shadow work\" is just realizing they have some negative personality traits and going \"oh, well. That's just my shadow self. The devil made me do it.\" without bothering to ask themselves WHY they act the way they do and how to heal that part of themselves.\n\nIt can get very intense, and this is why some people say \"meditation can be dangerous\".\n\nNote that there's \"negative feelings\" in the OP, not \"thoughts\". If you also learn to integrate those feelings by experiencing them fully, tracing them to their source and letting them run their course, it can be some form of shadow work. But this study seems to be quite poorly done.\n\nI prayed for 20 years at the minimum 5 times a day but often 7-8 times a day. Each prayer a ritual taking up to 15min in a way it could be considered mindfulness /mantra type meditation..when I reflect back on those 20 years, I realised I only ever truly meditated a few moments in all that stillness.\n\nIt's very easy to sit and act out a mindful meditation practice yet never actually meditate.\n\nThis isn't very reassuring. A common question on meditation is \"am I doing it right\" and the common answer is something like \"if you are trying to meditate, then that's meditation\". From what you're saying, maybe all the people worrying they're not actually meditating might be right and are pretty much wasting their time?\n\nYes, but you we need to start somewhere. Trying is the first step.. eventually you'll notice that trying is an obstacle..then you try, \"not to try\" and that too becomes an obstacle.  It's so very subtle yet very obvious at the same time haha.. so committing to noticing your experience is the first step.\n\nFrom my experience, the way mindfulness is communicated is in general utterly and needlessly confusing. Especially this \"effortless\" and \"not to try\" thing.\n\nIt's a fact that you can't change your behaviour without effort or \"trying\" and so what these people probably mean is \"after some time, mindfulness can become your default state, at which point it should feel mostly effortless.\n\nAlso, I see way too little communication about the technical aspects. For example, I like to liken what should be going in one's mind to \"directing your inner spotlight ( narrow / broaden it and so on )\". People need to know exactly how this stuff works.\n\nThis scares me, altough I do not practice prayers but I am a beginner in meditation so every time I give it a try, I feel as if I might not be actually meditating!!\n\nKeep practicing and become attune to the subtle nature of your experience. Eventually it becomes obvious.\n\nSo true! Someone else said there was a study on middle school students that showed no positive results. How are they testing it? I can see a kid sitting there with their eyes closed and just thinking of whatever they want for ten minutes and calling it meditation. I wonder how they prepped them\n\nCorrect me if wrong but I‚Äôve always found praying to be opposite of meditation in the sense that it strengthens desire and the ego.\n\nI mean, it depends on from where your prayer is coming from. \n\nI believe it's possible to pray in such a way where you are actually strenghtening your ego. \n\nTrue prayer means relinquishing yourself to allow bigger forces to manifest themselves. And that requires for the ego to... step aside, at least\n\nDepends how you define prayer. My practice involved surrendering to stillness which is a form of meditation.\n\nYeah, prayer to me seems to be a form of letting go of what we can't control.\n\nThis. This and, if the respective comments are to be trusted, the fact that most people involved didn't even enjoy the practice ( highly likely that they did it improperly / not at all ) are enough reason for taking this study with a mount Everest of salt. \n\nOn top of that comes that it's way more difficult to make what their minds are supposed to do click for someone than it may seem at first. If you don't try _really hard_ to be _really clear and elaborate_ about how it's all supposed to work, they WILL just sit there and \"relax\".\n\nAlso, continuous mindfulness ( from which you get the most benefit; turns out 80 / 20 can't really be applied to mindfulness at all ) is _incredibly_ difficult. Most people WILL NOT be able to simply align such a way of perception with all their regular activities, sadly.\n\nThat title is misleading. The study did not find ‚Äúzero or negative mental health improvement.‚Äù Instead, the results were more nuanced. Some students benefited significantly from mindfulness programs. They reported reduced stress, improved focus, and better emotional regulation. For other students, there was no substantial change in mental health outcomes. Interestingly, a small subset of students experienced worsened mental health outcomes. However, this group was relatively small.\n\nThis should be higher. Kids being forced to do something experience negative results from forced task, this study is flawed.\n\n‚ÄúStudents don‚Äôt like what truths lie inside of them, decides the meditation is the problem and not them‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThe students didn‚Äôt enjoy the sessions‚Äù\n\nThat‚Äôs like forcing an obese person to do 10 classes of gruelling cardio workouts. And then a year later you‚Äôre surprised they didn‚Äôt keep up the practice. And of course there‚Äôs no benefit, because they didn‚Äôt actually do it at home.\n\nThis study only confirms that it‚Äôs extremely hard to create long lasting positive habits in people.\n\nIf they‚Äôre ruminating on negative thoughts about the past or future, they weren‚Äôt practicing mindfulness.  \n\nThis study is misleading.\n\ndoing mindfulness for self-improvement is a bit like looking around a house to do repairs and improvements. Its just one initial step of a much greater project. In the eastern traditions where mindfulness is used, it was natural that mindfulness was just one part of a that greater set of practices and context to those practices. Also just like if you studied your home and found lots of parts of it lacking/in need of repair etc, but had no way to change things, then it would quite likely depress you somewhat.\n\n1. They became more aware of their bad mental health. It didn't necessarily become worse.\n\n2. They weren't consistent enough. One usually feels worse before feeling better.\nBecause unprocessed emotions come up.\nIf one doesn't keep at it he'll feel worse instead of better.\n\n3. They kept living unconsciously/inauthentically/unhealthy.\nMindfulness should stimulate one to make changes to life that are more in congruence with who the person is.\nElse its like cleaning the floor while spilling drinks.\n\nMindfullness also has a massive PR problem because it's been hijacked by self-help gurus. If you expect to be completely at peace and happy all the time you're going to have a bad time. It's just a tool to understand your own mind. Nothing more, nothing less.\n\nMeditation is just one of many tools, like a hammer\n\nWisdom (from whatever religion) is the instruction sheets.\n\nOf course, this is just my opinion. Heh\n\nOften being mindful can awaken you to all the stressors in your life and environment you‚Äôd previously tried hard to ignore and accept. Which makes you feel worse, especially if you aren‚Äôt able to address the stressors.\n\nmy question would be how old are these students ? high/secondary school? university?\n\nif they are in their early teens (early stages of development) i would see why they wouldn't give a beep about mindfulness exercises. Think about it, you are up to your neck in your studies and exams, i doubt you would go out of your way to reflect on your good and bad parts of your day. Furthermore if it was a much more lower age group e.g.12-16 yrs old they are still developing their own personalities and learning how to organize and process their own thoughts. Of course I'm not saying that reflecting on mindfulness is only for old people, i just think that its more beneficial and effective for an older age group who have already moved on from the education stages of their lives.\n\nAs for the negative results if i put myself in their shoes, I would always have this negative kind of feeling behind why they are conducting this study on me. it would make me feel anxious and might even make me assume that i SHOULD be stressed if there is a guy coming to school all the time trying to teach me how to be happy and positive. i wouldn't want them to make me think about any other negative things while I'm going through such an important stage of my life.\n\nAwakening sucks. The world rots. Being aware of now badly it sucks is not happiness. It's not supposed to be. We are looking for happiness where we should be measuring acceptance.\n\nThat‚Äôs a highly misleading title.\n\nThe study itself is named:\n\nEffectiveness and cost-effectiveness of universal school-based mindfulness training compared with normal school provision in reducing risk of mental health problems and promoting well-being in adolescence\n\nThere's a big difference between mindfulness and rumination\nMindfulness requires a certain conception of the self, and the relation of that self so conceived, to the thoughts experienced in mindful awareness \nRumination meanwhile is one of the top symptoms of depression.\nYou can't have meditative practise without plugging in the proper spiritual/philosophical approach and proper intention, it doesn't work.\n\nYes for example in Buddhism, right mindfulness is a concept.\n\nI would be careful with the reporting around the results around this study. There is a major push by authoritarians to eliminate any type of SEL programs from schools and reestablish ‚Äúzero tolerance‚Äù policies.\n\nthank you so much for bringing the study to this sub and shedding light on some issues that these bloggers, influencers, and trend followers never address\n\n\"sit with darker feelings without providing solutions\"\n\nWell yea that's not gonna help anyone. Being mindful is about *not* dwelling on things, learning to let thoughts pass through while fully experiencing them. This study appears to not be properly exploring that, if those engaged are being asked to literally sit in a puddle of difficult thoughts of course they're going to be upset, that's just teaching them depression and anxiety.\n\nTo me, this study is a reminder to not try to apply my mind to understand the benefits of meditation. I feel the benefits in my bones.\n\nMindfulness is an individual practice that takes different forms for each person. Coupled with the degree of difficulty for each individual as well as the multitude of activities that fall under the mindfulness heading and I believe the study had very little chance of producing meaningful outcomes from the start.\n\nThat doesn‚Äôt mean the funding could not be used all the same. \n\n‚ÄòInteresting‚Äô work. Carry on.\n\nI don't find it disheartening to see the result of this study. They were testing out something very specific and peculiar. They were testing out a very specific way of introducing meditation to school. Discrete meditation interventions that are completely external to the school curriculum. It's good that we know this way doesn't work, but it isn't very surprising, as it was predictable for principled reasons. This is the difference between \"meditation in education\" (bound to fail) and \"meditation as education\" (many already experience its value). It tells us nothing about the efficacy of meditation, and it doesn't even tell us it's impossible to convey the wisdom of meditation in schools. As sometone who studies meditation science and meditation philosophy, I wrote an article that is connected to this problem. I hope it clarifies things :) [https://philosophicalexercises.blogspot.com/2023/09/why-mindfulness-in-schools-does-not-work.html](https://philosophicalexercises.blogspot.com/2023/09/why-mindfulness-in-schools-does-not-work.html)\n\nAbsolutely not surprising. Practicing 'mindfulness' or 'meditation' or whatever, outside of the context of the Eightfold Path is going to dry one out, so to speak. \n\nI am going to use a very poor sports analogy here, so apologies in advance. Having people practice these things outside of the context of the Eightfold Path is like telling people it is okay to go tackle people outside the game of football. In other words, when you're playing the game of football, it is okay to tackle people and it is in fact part of the game. Outside of the game, it's something you just do not do.\n\nPracticing 'mindfulness' or 'meditation' outside of the context of the Eightfold Path will get you exactly what the study above shows.\n\nInstructing people to just 'be in the present moment and mindful', with nothing other than that is like pushing someone off a plane without a parachute. And yes, apologies for another analogy but to really explain things I would have to write too long of a post, and I fear nobody would read it.\n\nWell as they describe it, it doesn't sound like mindfulness at all. You don't sit with dark feelings? You try ti be mindful of them, what triggers them...so you can grow and avoid such triggers perhapse by healing the trauma that triggered it. Mindfulness is not simply sitting with dark feelings. The study sounds like it was deliberately misguiding.. also....if they didn't practice at home they didn't practice mindfulness whatsoever. Weird study probably made by a bias individual. üòÖ\n\nI believe your mind has to be at the right place for mindfulness to make sense - you have to understand the suffering of not being mindful, and for me this was a long journey - I‚Äôve dabbled on and off for many years, but then it started to click. Not sure it‚Äôs easy to replicate that kind of preparedness or awareness in a study.\n\nThat not meditation. That‚Äôs ruminating on suffering that leads to more suffering. Experiencing the suffering, sharing and recognizing impermanence, and valuing the company of other humans as a blessing in a hard world, and then letting go of it all‚Ä¶those things sound like they were missing. If they weren‚Äôt teaching suffering and the management of suffering, they are only increasing suffering.\n\nI think studies like this are harmful to both participants and the larger world of mindfulness, with leaders who don‚Äôt even frankly know what mindfulness actually means, and what meditation actually is. They‚Äôre cheating these students out of a lifetime supply of enjoying life more.\n\nExtremely misleading title. Also, weve done our own studies here in the US in schools showing similar results *with teenagers* but much greater results with children under the age of ten.\n\nThe studies used in this article were with UK grades 7-10. I hope more age specific studies on mbsr are conducted. As others have said i imagine willingness is critical.\n\nFortunately we have a ton of studies that do show the effectiveness of mindfulness.\n\nSource: i was on the board of a non-profit that brought these programs into schools\n\nWhy are visualisation and relaxation exercises called meditation?\n\nStudents were encouraged to ‚Äòsit with darker feelings, but without providing solutions, especially for societal problems like racism or poverty‚Äô.\nThat isn‚Äôt mindfulness‚Ä¶that‚Äôs mindless anxiety practice. What an abominable thing to subject these STUDENTS to.\n\nI‚Äôm not even sure what mindfulness is? There‚Äôs lots of meditations that, via skillful application, can have transformative effect. But I don‚Äôt know of any that can be applied in a formulaic manner and have good effect, except maybe four immeasurables practices.\n\nWhat did they think would happen when focusing on ‚Äúdarker feelings and upsetting thoughts?\n\nI don‚Äôt think any legitimate method says to do that.\n\nPersonally, I think there is a difference between mindfulness and meditation. For me, meditation is a spiritual practice which often involves visualization of things, bright lights, chakra work, safe places, etc. \n\nMindfulness is the practice of noticing thoughts and not judging them. I can see how this could create the results above. Just teaching kids to notice their thoughts probably isn't effective.\n\nThis study says Being a teenager in UK üá¨üáß is not fun. Being mindful of how much it stinks makes it worse. \n\nI‚Äôm glad it failed. The joy is in discovery, not compulsory meditation. The kinds of meditation that are helpful are different for everyone. \n\nIf folks don‚Äôt self select, it‚Äôs just more stuff these poor teens have to do that they don‚Äôt want to. How sad. It might have been a fun journey in their adulthood, now it‚Äôs a traumatic association from their adolescence. \n\nLarge + long term + institutionalized = are rarely words that promote positive affect + compassion + mental health üòê\n\nThey aren‚Äôt doing the fun kind of mindfulness where you go walk in the woods and focus on birds chirping. They‚Äôre thinking about their upsetting thoughts.\n\nForced meditation is an oxymoron. This honestly is a retard level study layout. 8 years‚Ä¶ What a waste of time\n\nhomeboys didn't know about the dark night of the soul or what\n\nI don't meditate for mental health.\n\n&gt;What do you think are reasons for such negative results?\n\nBecause the \"mindfulness\" practice that was being taught was both brief and poor quality.\n\nSo they were made to meditate a whopping 10 times and it didn't improve the students mental health? How unexpected.\n\nI don‚Äôt feel that this is mindfulness or at least it‚Äôs a specific approach. Learning to accept uncertainty is an important practice. But focusing on the ills of the world that you have no control of would understandably lead to depressed mood. The study is poorly designed and executed or the media is not understanding the purpose of the work, maybe both\n\nJust the practice of meditation isn't gonna solve anything. It is a game of mindset. Understanding the core philosophy of meditation is more important. Meditation is just the way to get there.\nThese things are beyond the realm of scientific reasoning.\n\nMaybe this training just opened their eyes to how fucked up this world is, and now they are lost.\n\nPpl tend to view meditation in this lens that it‚Äôs supposed to ‚Äúcure‚Äù you of all negativity and bad thoughts/difficult emotions etc. It‚Äôs not about getting rid of those at all, it‚Äôs about making friends with them. It‚Äôs about realizing that they aren‚Äôt going anywhere at all and neither are you. The way out is in. \n\nPer the comments above, this study sounds like it was not only poorly executed but also did not ask the right questions? Or ppl just don‚Äôt get what ‚Äúmindfulness‚Äù is all about. Asking ppl to sit for 10 minutes every 2 weeks or whatever with 0 to little guidance is not really a meditation practice.\n\nAlso I agree with the findings that constantly pointing out the symptoms without offering any real support or solutions for actual tangible problems which create said symptoms is not helpful at all. In my opinion, this is a result of this trend by our institutions (governmental and corporate) to virtue signal about mental health or the environment or social justice or what-have-you but basically stopping there. \n\nMeditative Awareness, I believe, can help you for ‚Äúself-created‚Äù problems. Help you let them be or recognize their transience, not to attache concepts etc. To make friends and cultivate a relationship with your own mind. But other problems that are not self-created require an actual form of intervention to resolve them.\n\nBecause \"being mindful\" is not enough to deal with the shitty aspects of life. Passivity alone wont get people anywhere, there's a degree of action that need to be done to actually solve problems in life.\n\nTherapist here, I‚Äôve said the same thing.  Asking people to be aware and ‚Äúsit‚Äù with unpleasant memories, feelings, or trauma doesn‚Äôt help them, it makes them suffer.  \n\nMediation/mindfulness can be used as a distraction technique (focus on the breath instead of the harmful thought) but to use it to highlight pain is harmful.\n\nWhat others have shared is spot on. It‚Äôs also worth noting that meditation is not a one-size-fits-all. Meditation changes the brain, and - to put it bluntly- people need the brain changed in ways specific to their difficulties. Ideally, people have some guidance for this process. You also cannot overlook the importance of the community found through a sangha. Look to the research of Willoughby Britton for more information on these elements.\n\nIt takes a lot of hard work to achieve results in meditation, the hard work involves being consistent and meditating daily, using the right mindset and techniques, i doubt that would be achieved using a western scientific approach\n\nI don‚Äôt usually get disheartened by one study. ¬†The empirical foundation are the results of many studies over time. ¬†I‚Äôm also wanting to look into how it was conducted, who specifically it applies to, and the limitations with which this result can be generalized to the larger population.\n\nTheres too many variables in those in order for this to be \"disheartening\", take this study lightly, and look at more research.\n\nsounds a lot like propaganda, and/or the world sucks. oh no, co-rumination? wouldn‚Äôt want large groups of people becoming aware and angry with the way the world works!\n\nthat's the dumbest thing I've ever heard\n\nSilly to call this a minfulness study\n\nWe have tons of info from numerous studies saying the opposite. I wouldn‚Äôt take this one as credible\n\nYeah *Altered Traits* by D. Goleman &amp; R. J. Davidson is the real deal not this crap\n\n‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt practice at home‚Äù meditation really won‚Äôt benefit you if you don‚Äôt make it a consistent practice. Doesn‚Äôt mean this study is t telling us something but an evaluation of meditation should really evaluate it in the way it‚Äôs supposed to be practiced. Compliance is a key evaluative measure.¬†\n\nHopefully this doesn‚Äôt make headlines, because there‚Äôs pretty much no comparison between their methodology and actual meditation practice\n\nReading the study overview. The mindfulness consisted of ten lessons on mindfulness. This is highly unlikely to be effective. I‚Äôd be more interested in what would happen with students in a MBSR class or something similar. Daily practice is essential.¬†\n\nlol I don‚Äôt look to meditation to treat my mental health. I have meds for that. But I DO rely on meditation to help me manage my mental health and for that it has been a life saver.\n\nMeditation combined with the expectation of benefits can be frustrating if the meditation isn‚Äôt consistent. \n\nMost of these programs that work with schools and workplaces talk about how amazing the benefits are but fail to put in structure to ensure a consistent practice.  Then when people mediate inconsistently they‚Äôre frustrated they don‚Äôt see benefits and end up in exactly the same place but less confident they can improve.\n\n‚Äúbring awareness to upsetting thoughts,‚Äù encouraging students to sit with darker feelings, but without providing solutions.\" This isn't Mindfulness this is a mind trap. Mindfulness is clearing your mind of your thoughts and being more in the present and working on the here and now. Who would like just sitting with your negative thoughts? No shit the kids did not like it.\n\nmost ppl dont know how to think. they just react emotionally. so reminding them of their problems or issues without some form of resolution is essentially just psychological torture\n\nThe true scientific method is a double blind study. I wonder how this was conducted. I disagree, my mental health has drastically improved! The goal of meditation is not to find immediate solutions to all your problems. It is not a magic portal. It is to help you live in the present. If there are traumas or problems that plague you, meditation is a tool not the cure. I see doctors, take meds, pray and meditate, eat better, sleep better and exercise and all these methods commingle to bring me my peace of mind.\n\nI mean - without the dharma mindfulness isn‚Äôt necessarily beneficial. Additionally, the point of insight practice is a spiritual path that leads to certain shifts in what one identifies with and ultimately an awakening experience of some kind that frees one of existential ennui. It‚Äôs long known that sometimes there are difficult points on that path. Mindfulness alone is often called ‚Äúdry insight‚Äù practice and is absolutely the most difficult and unpleasant way to progress spiritually. \n\nThe type of meditation that is beneficial for mental health generally without fail is loving kindness meditation. Without balancing mindfulness with this of some form of concentration meditation to provide pleasant emotional states, mindfulness alone can be outright harrowing. \n\nThis study shows the problem with secularized mindfulness, and it shows the danger of not having a meditation teacher who has studied dharma. \n\nMeditation is a spiritual technology not a mental health treatment. And it‚Äôs not the silver bullet solution to everything - sometimes people need trauma therapy or else mindfulness practices can actually be mentally dangerous.\n\nWow. \n\nI think this sucks, and i'll tell you why.\n\nFirst, they are teaching to adolescents. Of all times in a human being's life, this is the one most confusing and profoundly transformative. Of course these poor young people are going to come up against some powerfully confusing thoughts, emotions, and bodily sensations.\n\nIf it were taught to elementary schoolers as a form of PLAY, then we would be getting somewhere.\n\nAdults learning meditation after they become adults is usually the most typical way people in the West (such as myself) learn meditation.\n\nSecond, it was taught in the framework of modern Western education, which I am VERY critical of for many reasons.\n\nTo start, the people teaching this program were authorized by an eight week mindfulness seminar. Who taught it? What methods of meditation did they teach? What tradition did they come from? Did the teachers actually have any profound insight into the nature of reality, or did they just do it, take the test, pass the class and decide to parrot that information to teenagers?\n\nTo me, it seems obvious that this whole fiasco was treated like any other class in school, so of course the teenagers are going to hate it. \n\nWhy should they actually turn inward and suddenly get really introspective just because a teacher told them to? Will it affect my grade? Will it make me a better person? Will mindfulness make that cute boy in class finally look at me? \n\nNo, because it was treated like a math class and the students didn't want to do their homework. Because they weren't being graded, they didn't.\n\nI don't think that's a problem of the students, and I think this entire study reflects far more on the state of the education system in the UK (and any country that follows a similar educational model) rather than saying anything definitive about meditation itself.\n\nI hate this for many reasons, but that about sums it up.\n\nI think of meditation as the mental health equivalent of brushing my teeth - not necessarily an ‚Äòenjoyable‚Äô exercise in isolation but the benefits tend to accrue over the time\n\nMeditation might not be for everyone. For some, good old mental therapy will be way more helpful.\n\nFor 2600 years Buddhism has recommended 20 mintues of mindfulness a day, and the science agrees.  My guess is that study participants were mostly averaging this amount.\n\nBut I wonder if, given the pressures of our modern world, 20 minutes isn't enough.  It's like doctors recommending a 20 minute walk every day - it's great for the average person in the world, but consider a 400 lb. American - they need more exercise than that.\n\nI didn't see the benefits of meditation until I began doing a lot more than 20 minutes daily.\n\nIn comparison to what \"control group\" were these conclusions reached?\n\nIt's possible that the entire study group being teenagers who are made to meditate as part of a school program, may find it uninteresting, and do not do any meditation \"homework\" are something to do with the reasons for the results.\n\nMotivations of those carrying out this study has to be questioned.. have they undertaken intensive meditation retreats to have first hand experience/knowledge? \n\nwhy would people willingly undertake a meditation program like a 10-day retreat time after time if there is no benefit or has negative impacts? Granted, it hasn‚Äôt completely resolved my ADHD and I do get depressed from time to time, but it has given me a bit of resilience and compassion.. all I‚Äôd say is particularly for meditation, it is a very personal thing that you need to experience first hand, do not go by a study..\n\nBecause that's not mindfulness. Sounds like they are focusing on the past not the moment of now. Upsetting thoughts are in the past. Sounds like they are making it worse. Mindfulness is misunderstood. Eckhart Tolle explains it in his book \"The power of now\". We regret the past and worry about the future. Mindfulness should be taught as an action not a meditation. Getting caught up in the doing focuses the mind. The only way you can change the future is by what you do now.\n\nMy thoughts are that this lines up well with other significant findings on meditation from studies, particularly mechanism studies. The few mechanism studies I have seen that showed results were examine people with over 30,000 cumulative hours of lifetime meditation, and the prerequisite for different response to stimuli was that they had done at least 1 week long meditation retreat, or more.\n\nMindfulness has been fantastic for me, I don‚Äôt need science to tell me that individually. But I don‚Äôt feel the need to extrapolate anecdotal experiences to the wider population in contradiction to solid scientific results. All my mindfulness training is only in the context of building a specific skill to solve a specific problem with a solution that requires, as a prerequisite, a mindful ‚Äústage‚Äù to see what is going on before then stepping forward into the solution. I think that is ethical based on all the studies I‚Äôve read.\n\nThis begs the questions: \n\nGeographical location? \nDemographics (aside from age)? \nHousehold environment? \nPeer judgments? \nAnd is there a critical window that is helpful/effective (much younger or older) and a window that can be more risky (pre-teen to teen due to hormones, not knowing how to even manage emotions outside of mindfulness)?\n\nDeveloping good habits should be accompanied by minimizing bad habits as much as possible. \n\nMeditating for 30 minutes a day and spending 5 hours of screen time can destroy anyone's mental health. Simply meditating isn't enough; it should be complemented by good sleep hygiene, healthy eating, responsible use of technology, healthy self-esteem, and so on.\n\nThere is a major problem these days in how meditation is presented. It's sold as this solution to all sorts of problems. However, meditation isn't so much a solution, as much as it is a skill to develop awareness. \n\nPart of a proper meditation education is to actually do something about the things you discover through meditation. Obviously if students are only told to sit there, think about bad things, and then leave then it's not going to help them much. They have to actually understand that the things they discover through meditation are guide posts that they can use to make further progress.\n\nIf you see something negative you shouldn't ruminate in it. Instead you should acknowledge that it is there, and continue onwards. Now usually people cut it off there, but what does it mean to continue onwards? Sure if you work properly then the thought will eventually fade away, but the next thought isn't far behind. With meditation one of the things you can accomplish is to help direct the next thought into a different direction, and being able to take a dark train of thought, and direct it into a brighter place is well within the realm of possibilities.\n\nHowever, it's not like these are natural skills. There is a process to it, with layers and layers of mental shortcuts and personal insights necessary to actually guide you in how to do this. Part of many traditional approaches to teaching meditation involve teaching a lot more besides; things like morality, dedication, tolerance, and discipline are almost always part of such courses. They're not just \"how to awareness\" classes, they also provide guidelines on ethics and philosophy that people can take with them into their life. The idea is not only to teach people to be aware of what they are experiencing, but to also give people some sort of guidelines for what they should aim to become.\n\nMany modern approaches to meditation miss this, teaching only how to be more aware of things, without actually providing any additional context, be it moral, biological, or psychological. In such a context it would make sense that such meditation lessons could be distressing. You're teaching people to open their eyes, so they see that the world as it is, but you're not giving them any tools to make either themselves, or the world a better place.\n\nMindfullness without compassion is not enough.\n\nLike most science reporting these days on ANY subject, the title of the article is click bait and inaccurate (\"28000 students over 8 years)\".  Unless I missed something in reading the study, no one was studied over 8 years. Having read the methodology used as documented in the study abstract if the results were that these peoples lives were transformed in any positive or negative way by this experience- I wouldn't believe it for a minute. Check it out, \"The SBMT involves 10 manualised, structured lessons (typically 30‚Äì50‚Äâmin each), normally delivered over one school term (either in the first or second year of secondary school). You take a bunch of random kids 10 or 11 years old (please someone correct me if I'm wrong about how Aussie secondary school works, give them 10 30-50 minute classes on whatever, (the whatever is very vague) and test they in a few years for changes.  Even if whatever they were taught was on-the-nose and perfect it would be useless if it stopped there.  Maybe they told the kids to practice whatever they were taught every day, every week or never.  Picture yourself at that age.  Would you do it?  I wouldn't.  Mindfulness has to be an every day thing for an extended period of time for it to have any meaningful effect.  Getting any measurable long-term results from mindfulness training takes months or years.  You have to maintain it because we are trying to overcome a lifetime of conditioning. I do not find the results of this study disheartening at all.  What is disheartening is that another poorly designed study has been reported (somewhat inaccurately) as a significant fact.  This study tells us next-to-nothing either way.  The state of science reporting in general is the biggest reason that so many people say they \"don't believe in\" science these days.  To the OP...I am not being critical of you, just the study and the reporting.\n\nI think theyre missing the point entirely. \n\nI'm new to meditation, but have been a student of eastern healing traditions.\n\n One frustration of mine is that because these scientists simply do not understand our traditions, they end up designing studies that are plain wrong. They look for things that are characteristic of western equivalents but which do not exist or are not regarded the same way in eastern traditions. \n\nThere is a clear divide between traditions that must be crossed if you are to understand the other, but scientists who believe what they know is the only truth will not even see this line. \n\nEspecially for something that is intangible and borders on the spiritual, both of which are not exactly western science's strong points after spending centuries denying these. \n\nMindfulness is not just something they can impose on kids like they do rote memorization. Imo, this is a leading the horse to water situation. How can you test the horses for the effects of the water if after leading them to the water, they don't even drink?\n\nThis is a garbage study\n\nI‚Äôm pretty sure the purpose of meditation is to understand the nature of consciousness. Whoever meditates for the side effects of meditation is setting themselves up for failure. Let alone this was a study of participants who most likely didn't even want to meditate.\n\n&gt;students didn‚Äôt enjoy the sessions and didn‚Äôt practice at home.\n\nThat alone could explain the results.\n\nBad model\n\nMeditating without actuall wanting to meditate is worse than just not meditating at all, didn't really need a full study to verify what's plain.\n\nSchools are unfortunately not the most inviting places for mindfulness practice‚Ä¶they could be and can be in certain settings.¬†\n\nI wanna say, firstly the way they taught it might have been ineffective and secondly the world has continued to become a scary, chaotic and depressing place in the last 8 years so I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if any benefits were cancelled out. It makes sense that people would be more depressed imo.\n\nMy school does calm classroom mindfulness and usually the teachers either read the meditation instruction or one of the kids with choppy reading ability tries to. They make no effort to sound relaxing or actually induce a meditative state... I feel like if they just played an audio it would be much more effective.\n\nAs soon as I read societal issues, I knew this was a sample on which nothing will work.\n\nAfter seeing that the students didn‚Äôt seem interested and didn‚Äôt practice just shows me that nobody should pay attention to this study\n\nThe healing or the solution of an issue starts with awareness and acceptance. But the next step would be transformational change, or growth, and ascending.\n\nYou are disheartened? Did you read the study? It‚Äôs basically trash imo. Worthless research.\n\nBasically if you try to take bits and pieces from a great civilization and assimilate it into yours this is bound to happen.\n\nIf a CS major is exposed to dissection of a human body he will not be able to do it and a medic won‚Äôt be able to code the linux kernel out of the box. \n\nWhat I mean is that proper training and life discipline is needed for any meditation to succeed.\n\nEasy option is naam jap, it is saar or summary of hinduism\n\nI use it to just pay attention to what I‚Äôm doing and what‚Äôs going on around me. Put to practical use they might have liked it better.\n\nMindfulness could be seen as a type of meditation I suppose, but meditation isn‚Äôt just mindfulness. Using this study to claim that meditation has no benefits would be like doing a study of people who run, seeing that running has no positive impact on bench press strength, and then concluding that exercise has no benefits.\n\nSounds more like concentrating on negative things in your life instead of thinking about the positive things in your life. Who doesn't get depressed thinking only about negative things? This is a bad idea from the beginning. Bring back Norman Vincent Peale \"The Power of Positive Thinking\" or Wayne W. Dyer's \"Your Erroneous Zones\" These helped me.\n\nThis seems more of a problem with making something mandatory rather than voluntary. Similar effect with‚Ä¶ anything. Prayer, going to church, reading the Bible, exercise, watching a beneficial video. They probably had negative effects because they were bored which does increase rumination. \n\nBut this also dashes the hopes of having students taught mindfulness in schools in the traditional sense. If the simple fact of being ‚Äúforced‚Äù to be mindful is a problem then it forces schools to only offer the classes as electives or just tips, not teach it as a requirement for mental health. \n\nBut I get why they did this. It‚Äôs kind of hard to figure out the long-term benefits or dangers of something if you don‚Äôt have everyone starting on the same page.\n\nThe study was done by people with no understanding of meditation or Buddhism. Mindfulness is a practice done in a context of study, meditation, ethical conduct, etc., on the path of enlightenment. These people have taken it completely out of context. This is a typical approach of modern science. We reduce nutrition to a dozen vitamins, sugar, and protein. Then we wonder why 6 Twinkies with a vitamin pill doesn't have the same effect as 2 apples. We try to reduce health to statins and happy pills. We want to reduce everything to hard data. \n\nThat problem has become even worse with computers. I'm guessing that they probably measured study results with questions such as: \"Do you feel happier since doing this practice?\" Strongly agree. Somewhat agree. Neutral. Somewhat disagree. Strongly disagree.\n\nA question like that is meaningless. There's no subtlety to it. But those kinds of questions have become uniquitous because computer software can reduce responses to numeric values -- 1 to 5. Then computer software can spit out all sorts of stats and comparisons. At that point it's all useless gibberish, but it sounds official, it's clearcut, and it saves a lot of work on the part of researchers.\n\nThe researchers in this case are also applying a complex of preconceptions that they're not even aware of: Meditation should produce happiness. Happiness is good. Thinking about problems is bad. Positive thinking is good. It's a very naive kind of pop psychology mindset.\n\nAnyone who takes up basic meditation in hopes of felling more positive is likely to feel disappointed. That's not necessarily a bad thing.\n\nMindfulness is a result of long term meditation, and isn't just living in the moment, as nobody even understands that concept .This study was done with people that can't meditate worth a crap. Take their  cell phones away, and teach them how to actually meditate. I am not surprised at these kinds of studies, that don't understand the nature of mindfulness and meditation, and the ability of the  mind to get distracted.\n\nA lot of comments here suggesting that willingness to meditate facilitates the benefits, although I have to agree with the result of these studies (at least for now). I find myself becoming aware of issues within myself, but unaware of ways to resolve the conflict or arrive at any degree of acceptance. It's possible that this is the first stage of many, though!\n\nAlternative headline rejected by editors:\n\n‚ÄúMeditation benefits millions of people across the globe, let‚Äôs hear how it doesn‚Äôt helped those people who **don‚Äôt** practice it‚Äù\n\nThese students didn‚Äôt seem to have the knowledge of who they truly are (the observer). Observing your thoughts and still identifying with them isn‚Äôt going to help anyone, it would most likely perpetuate the feelings of shade.  If these students were aware that they are pure consciousness and not their thoughts, but the observer of their thoughts, then it would turn out differently as they would identify with something much higher and greater than the lower self that experiences these traumas.\n\nWho conducted the study and who funded the study?\n\nThen look at the design of the study.\nThen look what actually has been done.\n\nThen think for yourself.\n\nThe reason for the results? Who could ever possibly know? But in the end, who cares? The science points towards the general efficacy of meditation for alleviating symptoms of depression and anxiety. There are so many types of meditation out there to try other than just mindfulness meditation. Further more, if the general consensus was that the kids didn‚Äôt like doing it the results are not going to be accurate because proper participation cannot be verified. I can sit in my chair with my eyes closed and do my meditation or I can sit there and sleep and my Mrs. would never know the difference.¬†\n\nFurther down, it says one factor seems to be that labelling the emotions as this or that isn‚Äôt helpful. Taking the alternative approach that emotions are malleable (ever changing!) leads to a realisation they are fixable.\nThere is evidence from Vipassana that many complexes get resolved (anxieties and phobias etc.) without ever the student consciously labelling them.\n\nOk, just because they formed some mindfulness classes, and attempted to teach mindfulness, there is no way to gauge what is going on in the minds of the students. Not all kids understand algebra either, no matter how many classes they take. Moreover I could find no explanation in the study that explained how mindfulness was being taught. It could have been all wrong. \n\nJust who funded this study anyways, and do they have any motive for subterfuge? Oh, it was The Wellcome Trust founded by a pharmaceutical magnate. Hmmmm.\n\nself help suggestions have always made me mad and frustrated, I wish it weren't so. I start and then realize...I'm screwed. I already ruminate and feel like crap, how in the world would it help to read about what other people have done and improved when I didn't? I don't get it. I'm miserable, but I read self-help stuff and get MAD and frustrated bc I will never ever get there, so I give up.\n\nWhat does this have to do with maoi? ü§î\n\nI am not surprised meditation did not improve mental health. Mindfulness meditation is an excellent means to develop and refine the healthy mind; but once the mind has gone askew, don't expect meditation to straighten it out.\n\nMental health conditions are increasingly being understood to be caused by physical dysfunction of the brain. In particular, chronic inflammation in the brain has been found in many mental health conditions, with the inflammatory state perturbing normal brain functioning. Since the brain creates the mind, once the brain has gone wrong, the mind may also malfunction. Meditation affect the mind, but it cannot really reach and fix physical issues in the brain."

    "body": "Just wanted to share my story, in case it helps someone.\n\nI went through about 9 years of really bad depression. It got so bad that I tried to take my own life. After that, I started using hard drugs like cocaine and tussi for a few months, trying to block out the pain. But it didn‚Äôt help at all.\n\nOne day, I realized I couldn‚Äôt keep living like that. I needed something to pull me out of the mess I was in. That‚Äôs when I found meditation. At first, I just tried it to calm down, but as I kept going, things started to change for me.\n\nMeditation helped me stop living in my head so much and brought me back to the present moment. I started letting go of the stuff from the past and stopped stressing so much about the future. I also realized that the negative voice in my head wasn‚Äôt really me. That changed how I saw myself and everything around me.\n\nNow, I‚Äôm clean, and I‚Äôm actually enjoying life again. I wanted to share this because if you‚Äôre struggling, I want you to know that things can get better. You can turn your life around, even if it feels impossible right now. All is impermanent, all is changing.\n\n",

    "all_comment_text": "[deleted]\n\nThere is a show on netflix, i think its called headspace: meditation guide or something like this, it is very informative and also will help you to start in several techniques depending on your mood, literally. Vids are 10-20 minutes each.\nPd: english is not my native so i hope you understood\n\nRemember that pretty much everybody has a noisy thoughts. I was convinced for a few decades that mine was so bad I couldn‚Äôt meditate. I know I have a daily practice going for about six years, and sometimes I just sit and watch the thoughts go by, hopefully mostly from a detached perspective. There are quite a few gurus creating the impression that it‚Äôs common for people to empty their minds, yet the more I‚Äôve gotten into meditation the more I understand that this is somewhere between unlikely and impossible. \n\nIt‚Äôs all about observing whatever comes up, with steadily reduced resistance to ‚Äòwhat is‚Äô as a longer term result.  Good luck.\n\nFreeing the mind is a more accurate description. Thoughts can get soooo out of control that they completely dictate your reality. Freeing the mind from always thinking is how you live in the present and are able to just feel in your body and have your intuition guide your actions and not the frantic mind\n\nI really like this post. Much love to you :)\n\nThis meditation technique has been practiced in India since the Satya yug. Lord Shiva has started this technique and it is called as dhyan mudra. Now the modern world has realised it's worth and called it a meditation. It was there and followed in India since thousands of years\n\nI'm happy it's helped you. I was in a bad place with depression as well. Substance abuse and  I've even had Electroconvulsive therapy (electric shock therapy). Meditation has been the change that's helped me the most. Not living in my head and actually living in the outside world again is amazing.\n\nThanks for sharing. That quite same of my story too!\n\nThank you. I needed to read this today\n\nBest thing I have done and actually stuck with, I started October last year and it is life changing !! Just going to do my morning meditation now :)\n\nHow long did this take? I‚Äôve just started hoping to feel similar.\n\nEveryone‚Äôs timeline is different, but for me, I started noticing some changes after a few weeks of regular practice. At first, it was tough, my mind wandered a lot. But over time, I found it easier to bring my focus back and stay on track longer. Now I'm pretty aware of my thoughts, desires, feelings and feel much more in control of my life. Just be patient with yourself and keep at it. Even if it feels slow, every session helps you grow. You‚Äôll probably start seeing little changes soon, like a calmer mind and more awareness. And that little changes sum up for bigger ones, stay hopeful and believe in your capacity for change, for change is the only constant.\n\nThanks man I‚Äôm definitely keeping at it üëç congrats on turning your life around üëå\n\nCan you share how you start bringing yourself back on the first meditation because I have anxiety and whenever I try to start, the mind is so active , I can‚Äôt calm down, please share how u do it even on the first one, please and thx\n\nI totally understand how difficult it can be to calm the mind, especially when anxiety is in the mix. When I first started meditating, my mind was all over the place, and it felt like the more I tried to calm down, the more anxious I became. One thing that helped was writing down my thoughts before meditating. It allowed me to clear some mental clutter and process any strong emotions beforehand. Then, when I started meditating, I focused on my breath, noticing how it felt to breathe in and out. If my mind wandered, I‚Äôd gently bring it back. Sometimes, I‚Äôd also pay attention to how my body felt, like the sensation of my feet on the floor or my hands on my lap. Guided meditations provided structure and something to focus on when I needed it.\n\nIf focusing on the breath feels too difficult, an alternative approach is to concentrate on external stimuli. You might listen to the sounds around you, feel the air on your skin, or notice the sensation of your body in contact with the chair or floor. This can help ground you in the present moment and redirect your attention away from anxious thoughts. Remember, meditation isn‚Äôt about having a perfectly still mind; it‚Äôs about being present with whatever is happening. Each time you bring your mind back, you‚Äôre building mindfulness. It‚Äôs okay if it doesn‚Äôt feel perfect right away, just take it one step at a time, and be patient with yourself. Over time, it gets easier, and you‚Äôll start to notice calmness coming more naturally.\n\nWoah you share like a pro\n\nYoga has truly changed the lives of many of us. It's amazing how it brings balance and calmness to everyday routine. I like your post very much.\n\nI am really glad it worked for you. What is your practice ? What do you do specifically?\n\nThanks. My practice started with basic mindfulness meditation, where I‚Äôd just focus on my breath and bring my attention back whenever my mind wandered. Over time, I added a few things, like doing body scans to relax and observing my thoughts without getting caught up in them. This helped me see that the negative voice in my head wasn‚Äôt really me. Alongside with studying eastern traditions, like buddhism and some parts of hinduism.\n\nI also practice loving-kindness meditation, sending positive energy to myself and others, which has helped me be more compassionate. I try to meditate a little every day, and while it‚Äôs not a quick fix, it‚Äôs made a huge difference in how I feel and handle life.\n\nIs observing the thoughts without getting caught up in them different than bring the attention back to the breath when the mind wanders? Also sometimes my mind can wander for minutes at a time before I remember to come back to the breath. Is that something that will get better with practice?\n\nIt is pretty similar, but the object of attention is different, one is the breath or the sensations of breathing and the other one is a thought or thoughts, that sometimes carry negative emotions with them, but in this practice you just observe them without judgement, I practice writing my thoughts even words that just pop up, to see the current flow of the mind. \n\nAnd yes it gets better with practice, you notice it quicker and can stay longer without straying from the object of focus.\n\nHow long are your sessions?\n\nSomewhere between 20 - 30 minutes 2 - 3 times a day depending on the amount of spare time there is. But I try to be aware of the present moment a lot of times troughout the day.\n\nFrom beginning or did you start with less? What were the starting sessions in mins. Thanks\n\nWhen I first started meditating, I began with shorter sessions of about 5 to 10 minutes, with a guiding voice. As I got more comfortable, I extended the time a few minutes and stopped the guided ones, but they are helpful in giving you a structure and bringing you back when you are lost in thought without noticing. It's been a gradual process, and increasing the duration bit by bit helped me build a consistent practice without feeling overwhelmed. It's all about finding what works best for you and allowing yourself to grow into it.\n\nHow did you learn to just let your unwanted thoughts be? Or did that just come with time and perseverance?\n\nLetting unwanted thoughts be is something that developed over time through practice and understanding. I've realized that thoughts are transient and don't define who I am. Instead of trying to push them away, I observe them without attachment or judgment, letting them pass naturally. It's a skill that comes with consistent practice and understanding of the impermanence of all things. With time and perseverance, I've learned to accept these thoughts as part of the flow of consciousness, allowing them to come and go without being greatly disturbed by them.\n\nI suggest to increase time like 45 min a day and you will see even more benefits...for long time 20 min wasn't enough for me,now I can sit for 1 hour And it's life changing\n\n..encouraging that it very happily worked for you. With best wishes.\n\nSuperb and so true ‚ù§Ô∏èüôè\n\nYes, everything is impermanent and nothing and no one is really separate. Thoughts are not self but a product of direct and indirect conditions of each and every experience one has had and every choice one has made of mind, speech and body over one's entire life, as well as the intricate network of cause and effect which is the situation that one happens to have been born into.\n\nWe do not get to choose the cards we are dealt, which are our genetics, family, location of birth, the socio-cultural and economic situation that we come from, and other things too. But we do have some degree of at least apparent choice with how well we come to understand those cards and how best to use them, and from what frame of mind we choose to act. Ultimately we are nothing and all there is is change, but relatively what we choose still matters, so acting in a way that is helpful, skillful, wholesome and wise where possible in mind, speech and body is something worth aiming for, even though it might be easier said than done.\n\nThank you OP, I needed to read this. \n\nI started meditating about 2-3 weeks ago but the last few days I‚Äôve been doubting if it‚Äôs really doing me any good? I‚Äôve been doing 3x 15 minutes a day. And the first week felt great, but that seems to have tapered off a bit. I will keep at it and maybe get that feeling back again. üïâÔ∏è\n\nI‚Äôve been meditating almost everyday for the last few weeks, but recently I‚Äôve been struggling. This came at the perfect time. \n\nThank you, OP.\n\nThanks for sharing this, with such clarity and simplicity. It's encourag it worked for you.¬†"

    "title": "Meditation has made my life much better but also much worse",
    "body": "I started my practice 4 years ago to deal with my ADHD and aggression issues. I can truly say it has helped me become a changed person. I started right before my last season playing college football and had the best season I've ever had, the way I perform and operate has enhanced, much more kind and empathetic, have awareness of and control of my ego (for the most part), most importantly I'm not spending money fixing things I've broken and not constantly putting the people around me on eggshells.\n\nOn the flipside, since becoming \"conscious\" it's been much harder to socialize, make friends, and I honestly believe it's made me more difficult to be around. Ball allowed me to get my masters and I'm doing okay for a 24 year old. I'm a confident person and I believe I deserve the right to be proud of and feel good about myself. I never gloat or go on about myself externally (other than now), try my best to share love and uplift everyone I'm around (kinda the eccentric happy go lucky type), but most people still think through ego and comparison and I can feel something about my character puts this internal conflict in others that i have a hard time understanding. It's a situation where many people are fond of me (at least they act like they are) but nobody wants to actually spend time with me. Pretty isolating and lonely tbh. \n\nThis is my first time posting instead of commenting and wanted to see if this is a common thing for people who have been practicing for a while. I'm trying to value and seek community, and would hate to have an idea that I can only be around other meditators or spiritual people. ",

    "all_comment_text": "Hey I wanna start off by saying, we are all strangers on the internet so take what I say with a grain of salt.\n\nIn my opinion, whether this is good, bad, right, or wrong makes little to no difference. If you are meditating and finding it to be beneficial for your personal life, especially in regards to controlling your emotions and Adhd. Then that is great. If you notice it is changing you as a person, and perhaps makes it tougher to in a sense connect with others or make friends, try to just notice that as well, doing your best to also notice your ego and sense of self with that thought.\n\nAlso, it could very well be that you are growing up and changing, you are still relatively young, you are still growing, changing, maturing, finding new interests, maybe outgrowing some old/current friends? \n\n\nI think it‚Äôs okay to acknowledge the shift, accept it and keep meditating..see if this persists for the next few weeks months or year to come, and  try your best to not be attached to it. \n\nI understand what I wrote is trite and maybe not as direct as you are seeking, but sometimes we find our answers through experiential knowledge rather than intellectual, this may be one of those times.\n\nThank you for sharing. Honestly I think I have just matured and have been looking for those deep connections in places I've outgrown.\n\n[removed]\n\nCan't agree more!\n\nI think that's a normal feeling but I understand where it can be difficult. Part of life is the process of growth and not everyone you know will understand your personal journey. My wife and I are both currently changing in our life right now and even our close relatives notice the difference, and tbh it's not always received positively. We know we're headed in the right direction, but not everyone will agree, and that is isolating. Stay strong in what makes you feel your best self and what is meant to be will sort itself out. \nBeing human is quite possibly the most difficult thing I've ever done üòã\n\nThis is right on point. You‚Äôve opened a door that will inevitably make for a more fulfilling life, which includes restructuring the foundation of your relationships and this can take time and feel like you‚Äôre learning a whole new way how to connect with people, because you are! You‚Äôre learning how to form meaningful, deep connections and the people available for this are fewer than your average relationship. Keep doing what feels good for your mind and body and in time you will attract and know when to connect to the people who resonate with the new you.\n\nExactly. It‚Äôs a mindset.\n\nAfter I started meditating, I felt that I was having trouble connecting with people. But as I thought about it, I already had trouble socialising with people, and meditating simply made me more aware of it, which made my socialising worse.\n\nI'm currently in Uni and after observing my schoolmates, I realised how awkward they are. They are hanging out and having fun, but they are not really connecting with each other. Meditation made me much more aware of it, which made me felt awkward, and being aware of how awkward I feel made it felt even more awkward.\n\n\\&gt; They are hanging out and having fun, but they are not really connecting with each other. Meditation made me much more aware of it\n\nThis actually is very insightful.  It sounds like the awkwardness you're feeling is more because the social situations you're describing are actually not comfortable for you, not because you're awkward, but because you noticed something artificial and you want something real -- \"they are hanging out and having fun, but they are not really connecting with each other.\"\n\nIt sounds like if you find people who can be genuine around each other, you'll have fewer (no?) issues socializing with them.\n\nYeah I dun really have issues in regards to social skills. If my job was to socialise with a room full of people or if I make it a goal I have no issues with it.\n\nI think being more aware helps u to find people more genuine. Really depends on what u want I guess.\n\nI tried really hard to get close to ppl, but it just didn't work out. I do enjoy small talk cause it's really helpful in getting to know others, but some dun even small talk. It's just gossip or insulting each other as a joke. I would like more variety in my conversations u know\n\nAbsolutely, more intriguing conversations where disagreements aren't based on emotions and multiple topics can be brought up with appreciation.\n\nYou made me laugh. That was a good comment. I can relate.\n\nIt's normal. The veil of illusion has broken. Human nature is like that. Just be patient because this isn't home, it's a path\n\nA wonderful way to put it. My first bout with debilitating depression made me feel like one of those astronauts whose tether to the ship was cut. I'm just floating in space with nothing to grab or anywhere to get footing. At some point all will be gone, as all once was, and that feeling was pervasive and all consuming and I was not prepared for it.\n\nOh yes! I felt like that as an astronaut too. A few days ago I heard that the experience on land is like enjoying an amusement park without being able to take anything away from it.\n\nI‚Äôm not sure if this will be helpful, but here are my immediate thoughts after reading: \n\nAnytime we change, there are things we must let go of. There is always going to be some sort of bittersweet realization that just because we‚Äôve changed, or grown doesn‚Äôt mean the other people in our lives have as well. \n\nIt‚Äôs true that ego is present in everyone, and more so in some, and with meditation it can be a lot easier to see this fact. In the past I found myself getting annoyed at other people, wishing this wasn‚Äôt the case. At a certain point, I realized that I actually have as much to learn from others as I thought they may have to learn from me. Even those lead mostly by ego, show me new perspectives on things in life. I also realized most people like to talk, and it can be quite enjoyable to listen. \n\nI think it‚Äôs important to reflect on if disconnection from people is due to trying to hold onto connections we used to have, or if it is because when we meet new people we talk before we listen. I‚Äôve found that when I listen to others, they give me signs of what they are and aren‚Äôt comfortable with. Many people unconsciously put walls up or set boundaries around certain topics that can be easy to break and not even notice when we see the world differently, and this can make people turn away. When I first meet people I‚Äôve learned to tread carefully when I speak and notice any signs of discomfort. \n\nI believe that as you continue down a path of growth, you are sure to meet other people who see things similarly. And these connections are so much more profound and incredible than anything that was feasible before starting to meditate. But it‚Äôs true that these people can often be few and far between, and learning to love and cultivate the shallower connections as well can be quite difficult.\n\nThis was extremely helpful thank you so much\n\nWell said!\n\nThis is just my opinion with little context, but maybe part of the problem is that you have surrounded yourself with people who are similar to who you were but now you have changed. You have learned some important things and are in a new stage of your life that maybe others around you aren‚Äôt quite at yet. Others see that change and can often be intimidated by it. People are much quicker to bury their problems than work through them and you are like a torch that illuminates the truths they would sooner forget. After putting in the work and improving your own life you notice a lot of things you once thought were okay might actually not be, one of the hardest things of growing is facing the possibility that the people around might not have your best interests in mind. seeing someone who is doing good makes it difficult for others to justify their own actions or lack there of. Misery loves company. The road of improvement can often be lonely but on the flip side it makes it easier to find genuine people who will do right by you instead of bringing you down. Another idea is maybe you‚Äôre just not used to being the new you and need to work on ways to communicate that better fit your current lifestyle and way of thinking. Or maybe you‚Äôre overthinking things, it‚Äôs important to think things through but thinking is often in opposition to action. The more you speak with people the more ways you will learn how to make it feel more natural. \n\nHopefully one of these ideas will help you but at the end of the day just keep doing what you‚Äôre doing, change can be difficult because it means letting go of things we once believed made us who we are. Just because you are doing the right thing doesn‚Äôt always mean others will always appreciate it so find the people who do because they are the ones who are worth your time. Good luck with your journey! ü•Ç\n\nThat helped me to read today‚Ä¶ I hope it helps OP! ‚≠êÔ∏è\n\nGlad to hear it! Good vibes upon thee always!\n\nI started meditating around your age to help with my trauma and anxiety and felt similarly lonely and isolated when my mind shifted interest away from some of the more material and superficial ideas I had and a lot of friends drifted apart over time. I realized that even though I wanted to hold on to the familiar, my mind had irreversibly changed its value system and those spaces allowed for new loving and respectful people to enter my life. I also am learning after at least 10 years of practice that change is constant even with close relationships and to embrace my enjoyment in solitude as well.\n\nYour change in socialization is a sign of the refinement within your being.  Congratulations, a clear sign that the meditation is working.  It's an uncomfortable concept now, stay with it and that discomfort will drop away.  \n\nTo expand your social circle, consider volunteering, especially to those in need.  Soup kitchen, hospital, animal shelter, adult nursing home.  You'll find people that are presumably more giving and compassionate than your current social circle. \n\nKeep it up!\n\nThank you a lot! I will definitely pick up volunteering, think I'd also enjoy the feeling a making a positive difference for somebody else.\n\nIt helps to have a medium for social interactions. It can be very fun being in a great mood around other people even without much to say. There is definitely good place for socializing and there's a lot to be said about how you can make gold out of silver if you go about it the right way. \n\nSometimes I think people learn to stop getting involved in situations which they do not prefer but the way we socialize is heavily influenced by pressure and duality. There is good reason to avoid getting involved in the wrong things but having a spark for socializing is very useful, even if you're soaking it in and going with what's helpful or needed. \n\nThat can really really help, seriously. It's one thing to have glistening love but it's a whole different thing for energy to really get involved with a feeling of love, adrenaline is a big component of profound positive emotions and handling situations well with various attitudes can make for an enriching experience.\n\nIt helps to have gusto but eventually it's dangerous beyond some small things, ya know. People learn to avoid others but sometimes there are people who would rather stay involved. It's a common thing people struggle with, interests can change as well for some people, they might not prefer to play video games anymore or something of the like, it has to do with priorities changing.\n\nWhen love and unconditional love is a priority then that opens doors, like the silver to gold analogy but it's all about that frame of reference :P\n\nIt can be helpful to learn how to have an authentic glow. When you pick acceptance and pick love or enthusiasm and empathy, it can be much easier to just talk in your simple way, but the way you do it can create pressure for the other person, in a good way. People don't tend to talk about some things like that, it can be particularly hard to just go and bounce simple positive emotions off of one another but on the other hand you can still do it very very well even when things are deeper or quieter. \n\nPeople really need their own personal room to grow and having that room kept open for them in a way that puts energy behind their next thoughts can help them to remember you in positive and energized ways. Different approaches for different reasons too, bar none many people are going to appreciate someone who can feel clearly right in front of them without a scent of doubt or negativity, many people learn to feel strange if they feel confident with love. That was a huge problem for me, it was truly challenging to take my emotion and express it in a straight line solely because of the way it felt and it had to do with growing up in school. \n\nJust feels funny, you may not even understand how you look, sometimes figuring that out a little can help but as people grow up they can get better at appreciating the little details and standing up for them in their heart because it helps ground them. \n\nThis is good rounded ways of thinking, your situation is situational. The way these people are morphing their emotions based on your behavior may not be associating you with other basic parts of what make them happy, and sometimes people are like that. \n\nI really like the word pressure for this kind of thing, one could imagine how it would be without pressure. Sharing from one moment to the next with positive emotions may not feel like pressure and if you don't see it that way that's fine. Still, if you *want* to have a good time with somebody, there's an energized and plentiful way to do it, timing means a lot. It's basically pressure.\n\nI wonder if there's actually a better word for it. Oh well ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π\n\nAnyways, common issue but present for reasons. Learning to be with someone between the lines and have a performance about it can help you a lot. There's a lot to good mental health, if you don't replace negative emotions and keep re experiencing negative emotions and such, there's a lot of reasons why being active in stories and energized can really help someone to feel through situations in a new way.\n\nLike tai chi or kung fu, balance but also elegance and skill, make things click, have determination. Don't hesitate too much to show compassion or care, even if it hurts. That can help, at that rate you're with them on their level and they can tell. Having energy behind those experiences, the adrenaline can actually help them to remember the experience. It cann be very helpful to be well rounded, balanced but also reliably energized.\n\nIt's unfortunate that some people just get stuck. Even if you understand what I'm saying I hope someone else has a bit of a go around the bend with what I'm saying. \n\nThor's hammer\n\nDeep meaningful impact.\n\nI'd rather people didn't unwittingly skip Thor's hammer\n\nThis helped me a lot thank you. Never thought about the adrenaline component it's absolutely true!\n\nüòä\n\nYou sound similar to a guy I know. He's a great friend but super chill and even keeled. But it feels a little bit odd bc he's just so centered and it's hard to relate to that sometimes. \n\nI think the best way people relate and want to spend time is when their perspective is acknowledged. If they get upset sometimes, it feels good to hang out with someone who gets upset too. If you are flawed and get nervous, it's great to hang out with someone who understands and gets nervous too. You have to meet people at their level. And it may be that if you're detached from most human faults then people may be feeling distance from you.\n\nI feel this too. As some have already said, meditation made me more aware of how much I don't connect with people around me. Really because I notified their toxic traits and honestly don't want to be friends with them. I'm hopeful that I'll find friends that are \"me\" people. Hopefully one day. I'm open and that's what I tell the universe everyday.\n\n[deleted]\n\nI can relate. My social has improved a lot after meditating. I get told I'm very charismatic but it's surface level I haven't really been make many deep meaningful connections with people since graduating.\n\nI want to thank you for posting - I had a similar experience with meditation. When I was doing a serious daily practice, my life was fantastic, yet simple interactions with anyone outside my inner circle became almost painful.  I‚Äôm relieved to get some perspective from that time with this post.\n\nJust a side comment, sometimes when one spends a lot of time alone, no matter if you meditate or not, it can be jarring to enter a social situation. Be gentle with yourself. Just remember we‚Äôre all in this together and try to find things you like about the ppl you‚Äôre interacting with.\n\nEmbodying even part of the image someone desires for their own life will attract people for selfish reasons. They'll focus more on what their association with you does for them -- which doesn't necessitate actual friendship. \n\nExample: people rushing to shake the hands of celebrities.\n\nBring an object of envy very naturally creates an interpersonal barrier between you and those carrying the envy. \n\nA positive perspective is that The universe has essentially provided your life with a filter to help avoid people who don't see you for you. \n\nI believe real connections are out there for us all.\n\nIt‚Äôs the energy you‚Äôre putting out there. People can feel what you think of them. Be understanding as you can. Best wishes.\n\nFunny because meditation has really helped me socialize more and get closer to people. I used be such an introvert earlier, now I can bring myself into the moment when I am with somebody, and the social anxiety is not there, and I give the other person my full attention and I have had such entrancing experiences with other people (in fact I had one with a friend just last night) and I am glad I don't need weed or alcohol as a social lubricant. In fact last time I went back home and met up with my old gang, I didn't even had to drink beer, I just had some coke and socialized better than I would have anyway. I am glad for meditation because I had given up on ever overcoming my social anxiety.\nEdit - Maybe listen to Alan Watts.\n\nYes .. it‚Äôs normal to feel this way .. \n\ngoing deeper into spirituality can be isolating .. it ales you look at life , people , relationships from a very different perspective .. most conversations seem dull or just noise .. \n\nYou seek something different ‚Ä¶. \n\nWhat‚Äôs important here is do not let it make you arrogant and make you feel like a spiritual supernova .. \n\nSpirituality should be humbling .. \n\nSo till the time you feel you‚Äôre finding it hard to connect .. keep your feeling aside and become the best listener you can be .. let people come to you and share .. become a safe space .. obviously have your boundaries intact .. \n\nYou dont need to share your stuff with people who won‚Äôt get it .. but for some you can be their safe space .. \n\nGive it time and you‚Äôll find people who you do vibe with .. it will take some time ‚Ä¶ but youll get there .. and for the rest just be empathetic but with boundaries . \n\nIma also in the same boat .. I have felt disconnected for many years .. it‚Äôs very isolating and lonely .. and you feel crazy and doubt yourself .. \n\nBut don‚Äôt punish yourself for looking at the world a certain way .. \n\nAlso if you want do look up this concept of chosen one on YouTube or google .. it may sound really weird .. but give it a shot .. and try and take the positives from it .. to make yourself a better person ( that‚Äôs if you resonate and don‚Äôt find it gibberish ) \n\nAll the best !\n\nI relate to this. I‚Äôm a lot more sensitive now that I‚Äôm in tune with my body and emotions. I don‚Äôt get triggered necessarily but I do get upset when I‚Äôm around people I can tell lack empathy or emotional intelligence.\n\nSuffer well brother\n\nAdding to the other responses, I would also say that this same feeling of isolation drove me to go for Sunday meditation at a local temple and meet some more like minded folks. \n\nYou are feeling isolated because you are connecting with the people who still have a veil on their eyes . The veil is the story of the ego.  Only some people, via a combination of luck and circumstance are able to overcome it but not many get it. \n\nThis is actually a pretty mature realization to have as 24 yo. I would advise,  to treat your normie friends with empathy and interest but don't hold them to your standards. \n\nAt the same time, make an effort to connect with other people who are on the contemplative path.  \n\nThis is also why in Buddhist and Hindu traditions, the Sangha or Mattha, is so emphasized- the path of contemplation need not be travelled alone.\n\nYes I think I make people feel super uncomfortable about themselves too because I make them face truths that they don‚Äôt want to .. \n\nAnd they take it as ego and comparison .. like they develop an ego towards me and start comparing .. but if they could just see the reality of the situation ..\n\nI‚Äôve been meditating for decades and back when I started it was extremely uncommon in the western world and in my small town in particular. I was in my 20s and while meditating helped me with so many issues, it also allowed me to step outside the ‚Äúplay acting‚Äù of society. It helped me observe and reflect on how absurd so much of it is. This does give you a certain kind of loneliness but over time I‚Äôve come to accept that I view the world we live in differently than most of my peers. That‚Äôs ok. Some old acquaintances don‚Äôt care to associate with me (just through natural factors) but I‚Äôve attracted some more accepting and even like minded people. But this path is one that is good to walk alone so don‚Äôt feel that you are doing something wrong. The world around you will adjust. Give it time. In the end, meditating makes YOU a better version of yourself and by default helps all other living beings you come into contact with. Don‚Äôt be impatient with yourself or others. It‚Äôs a process. A lifelong process.\n\nDo you know that you are now harder to socialise with? Meaning others have said this, or is this just a feeling?\n\nThank you for the insightful comment. I am currently reading the book. ‚Äúdon‚Äôt believe what you think‚Äú, by Pema Chodron. I‚Äôm thinking you‚Äôve also read this book. I say this because one of her talks in the book is about analyzing your feelings or thought it derive from those feelings. By basically asking yourself why do I think that, why would they be avoiding me, turn it inward and see what the real reason that you‚Äôre creating this reality is. Your comment made me think of that.\n\nI hope the OP responds to your comment.\n\nIt is a feeling, but a feeling based on experiences. I've become more uninhibited and there's a certain freedom I live with since increasing my awareness that many just don't have. Sometimes it turns into others getting annoyed that I don't care much abt opinions, the social norms, and and the \"should\" and \"should nots\" like they do, and me getting annoyed with others trying to control and put their frame on me. The wonderful people in this thread have helped me realize nothing is actually wrong. Just keep doing your thing and you'll find your people, and that your people may change as you grow and evolve.\n\nI'm going to tell you something different from the other commenters that I believe to be true. \n\nRegardless of your personal achievements and improvements, maintaining and creating friendships is a skill in itself. While it is possible you need to discover new friendships as you evolve, it's also possible that you simply are lacking skills in maintaining friendships. Are you genuinely listening to people? Are you even enjoying being with them? Do they feel heard or connected to you? \n\nJust because we evolve in some areas of our live doesn't mean we evolve in all others. If you were an introvert before it's possible you didn't develop that area of yourself that well. Now you might be more extrovert but you don't really know how to do some of the things required to evolve relationships. \n\nAnyway, something for you to consider.\n\nYep communication and making genuine connections is a skill. Every person (and being) on this earth has a right to be here and has something to share and teach you. Get it out.\n\nNonviolent Communication is a great tool for learning how to communicate well and aligns with spiritual practices. It's a spiritual practice in its own right.\n\nHello friend. I think everyone who has done introspection in the manner we have has been to the place you are now. This too will morph into something new.¬†\n\nYou will no longer feel alone at some point but in fact surrounded constantly by good company even when alone.¬†\n\nKeep the course. You will find great clarity, peace and joy.¬†\n\nI have had a friend see significant changes in her depression and anxiety getting off of her perscriptions using a light theraphy non transdermal wearable technology.  Would be happy to share if you are interested.  It basically takes the inflamation out of your body and balances cortisol.\n\nWe have ADHD. People don‚Äôt like us. (Not for ADHD - how our personality is). They may pretend in a surface level they do, but underneath their actions show otherwise. We tend to be very honest, straightforward people. In my 42 years I have learned that neurotypical people are not necessarily dishonest, but avoid their true feelings towards others. I think they are not as comfortable as we are talking about the topics you cover and it comes across as confusing to us, and often shady. In experience I have been alway been seen as arrogant. In almost every case, once I get to know people, they tell me they had it all wrong. \n\nI‚Äôm interested in getting into meditation but feel my ADHD is a barrier. Any got any good resources to help with that? Books/podcasts etc\n\nVery shady! Almost to a point where I'm becoming resentful and only want to share my energy with those like me. Thank you for the ADHD wisdom. Dr.K, HealthyGamerGG on youtube has amazing content on ADHD and meditation. It's how I got into it when I started because meds were never an option for me.\n\nHi, off topic but are u medicated; Or just living it? (wondering for myself). \n\nAwareness of urself and ur social surroundings can indeed make u less sociable, I still love talking to people because even though they totally differ; maybe even bad people. My awareness was centred more around time perception and management, I just realised I spent 4-5 hours hanging out with friends. It‚Äôs fun but once u become more aware of how short a day actually is, u start decreasing those hours to a beneficial amount (exceptions during vacation etc). Shortening those hours also made me quite picky in what I wanted to do, as I sometimes realised that I go out with someone and still feel as if I need social connection after those 2-3 hours; I still live with my family. \n\nIt made me want to go ‚Äòout in the world‚Äô again, I wanted to talk to new people again, to see if someone made me feel ‚Äòfresh‚Äô after hanging out. When something u think is a risk or problem, there‚Äôs always a new opportunity to adapt.\n\nJust living it, I hate how pills are pushed onto people instead of natural remedies like meditation for money. I'm with you on the pickiness. Other than work, I charge my energy for 2 social events a week that's all I got.\n\nSame, I‚Äôm quite against the capitalising of disorders; Currently medicated, but I‚Äôm getting many good habits in place and I notice that my focus in general has become better. Soon wanting to drop it too. \n\n2 social events a week is, in my opinion, enough. The social contact during work and other activities are also quite gratifying; If they can hit the spot of course.\n\nHello thank You for sharing. I understand your point. Meditation and yoga are a good way to understand you better, but also to be more aware of what is really important in life. In other words making the difference between the important and the non important or even superficial or artificial.\nYou‚Äôre young and to many people of your age give to much importance to superficial things, social networks, consumption, fast fashion ‚Ä¶ \nIf meditating gives you the opportunity to see who and what is really good for you, and get away from the rest, then I think it will be positive for your life !\nIt is better to have one good and real friend than hundreds of superficial relationships‚Ä¶\nTake care\n\nWhat was the situation like socially prior to meditation? More social but people liked you less or what? I‚Äôd like to know more about how that changed. Do you share less of your experience now in social situations? Or reach out to people less?\n\nI was much less social before and was a self proclaimed introvert. Then a sales job showed me I actually like people my thoughts were just so scattered I couldn't verbalize them effectively to have a good time socializing. Now I get told I'm charismatic pretty often but it doesn't lead to the deep friendships like the ones I had in school for some reason. This thread has helped me see we don't have to befriend the world just cherish and cultivate the few deep connections I already have and be open to more when they come.\n\nDeep friendships come with time, or with  shared experience‚Äîespecially of challenges. This is a major reason that forming deep friendships after school can be more challenging‚Ä¶ but it is completely possible!\n\nI've been practicing for about 5 years and teaching for two.. allowing yourself to be aware of your own narratives and the conditioned mind is the first step..\nIt's important to continually practice surrendering allowing and accepting the what is or the isness of the moment.. certainly I'm guessing you already do this but it's easy to fall into the trap of negative self-talk..\nMy personal challenges include overcoming triggering and slipping into unconscious activity at times but then I become immediately aware..\nJust because we meditate doesn't mean we're perfect it just means that our challenges are a little different from those who aren't aware on a regular basis..\nThe universe constantly gives us challenges... Whether it be inner conflict or suffering that's a normal condition..\nSo just allow yourself a little more slack..\n\nWell, finishing your education and ending your football career and starting on whatever's next is a pretty big change in your life. You‚Äôre used to  competing at a pretty high level shifting gears is going to take a while to get used to. Give yourself a break and be proud of what you‚Äôve done.  Also at 24 you‚Äôre still young and starting a new phase in your life can take a while to adapt to. I can‚Äôt see where meditation would cause the challenges relating to people you perceive be they real or imagined.  I would suggest talking to a therapist who can help you to figure it out.  I got help from a therapist after a few sessions and also started meditation at her suggestion.\n\nYes! You put into words exactly what I've been experiencing\n\nMeditating since age 13. I‚Äôm now 33.. it gets worse because you have awakened a higher level of understanding and vision within your own life and since you can and others CAN‚ÄôT see their own path/vision, they just mindlessly go on and stumble not knowing there is a vision of their life they are completely missing in front of their eyes‚Ä¶. I‚Äôm not a negative type but after 20 years of being this ‚Äúalone‚Äù, it‚Äôs crazy that people see your ‚Äúgreatness‚Äù but don‚Äôt like being around it as much because they‚Äôre too insecure of themselves‚Ä¶ idk til this day why so many of my old friends have fucked their life up so bad‚Ä¶ they never really saw their vision I guess.. idk..\n\nI know this is the meditation sub, but please allow me the opportunity to make an unrelated observation. Four years ago was also peak COVID time. I've noticed how much more challenging it is to connect with others since then as well. To me, it feels like many (most?) people are turning inwards and focusing on themselves, relationships with those in their households, or existing friendships.\n\nI don't mean to invalidate your experience. It could very well be because of your meditation practice as well. But just wanted to toss out an alternate idea as well.\n\nOther random thoughts on the topic:\n\nI have also noticed that it seems easier to make friends whenever there's either A) some shared (typically challenging) experience together or B) some kind of shared vice or unhealthy habit. It could be gossip, smoking weed, drinking/partying, whatever. I lost touch with many friends when I separated myself from those things.\n\nDo you feel comfortable sharing vulnerabilities and your personal struggles with someone who you want to better connect with? That could also help give people some more surface area of yourself to connect with. If people build up a perception of you being perfect or faultless, they might find it more difficult to connect with you or find you intimidating?\n\nYou sound like a really cool person though. I hope you find the connection you're looking for. I'm on that same path and dealing with that same type of issue.\n\nHey there Mate, \n\nNot too mich time to write therefore in short. Keep in mind that you have the ADHD, it comes with several things, next to the \"widly\" known things. Meditation could bei the reason that you are aware of IT, but that you have felt that way for a Long time and that have been the reason for your agression and so on... (Coping). I would highly recommend to psycho educate your self about ADHD (UK adult ADHD podcast, is what i like for example). And maybe search for a professional pschotherapist, it could help a lot. \n\nI have felt the same things, have also ADHD and meditation help me a lot (atm doing my PhD) but several things, related to the ADHD, needed other sources and help to be overcome, additional to the meditation.\n\nJust my idea and the way which is working out quite well atm.\n\nBest whishes!\n\nCommend you on your growth and  reaching out to community is a sign of that. I wonder about your last comment of not wanting to hang w spiritual\nPeople- I get that obviously you want a variety of friends but while reading your post I was thinking (excuse the comparison) of a former addict who says its harder now to find community with my old addict friends. Not knowing you or your social situation Im just wondering if its another area where you might look at who it is that youre trying to connect with? (Btw most of my friends are not focused on meditation/consciousness etc- but they are generally caring people.\n\nIn my case it is what i like‚Ä¶To be able to live with myself without being bored or alone.\n\nRather than constantly trying to look outside, It‚Äôs more introspection. To find me within me, understand me, Not running out and trying to find the missing puzzle.\n\nYes life happens, Yes people will come, Yes some of them will go. But in that silent moment i am with me..in peace with myself.\n\nAlso life has become more sustainable And I am able to control thoughts more easily. \n\nI do it to streamline my turbulent flow of thoughts &amp; it helped a ton.\n\n¬´¬†I never gloat or go on about myself externally¬´¬†\nIt‚Äôs not necessarily a bad thing to glorify yourself etc when it lends itself to the situation. It‚Äôs very important not to force yourself to correspond to what you want to correspond to - people might find you lacking in authenticity, It is necessary to be conscious that you feel the world through the ego and that consequently you do not have inevitably reactions appropriate because we are always in the ego in spite of everything it is not necessary to this wedge it is necessary to accept that you can have bad reaction and to observe it is bad reaction then but it is not necessary as I have the impression that you do it this cut of this ego this cut which is always only one illusion and which mes you in an illusion consequently\n\nI hear what you‚Äôre saying, and agree and part. I usually around blonde but I just wanna be curse. As I continue my meditation practice of about 2 1/2 years now, I find what you‚Äôre saying is true. True for me is what I mean.\n\nIt made me more aware of the unconscious reactions of people to literally everything that happens around them, everything that‚Äôs happened in the past, and all the horrible things that are going to happen in the future. It‚Äôs like buying a red Jeep, you think you‚Äôre being unique and then you just see red jeeps all over the place and you feel cheated somehow.\n\nThat‚Äôs what I got out of your post, once you meditate for some time and you get more centered and settled in life, you become more aware of this, and the constant unconsciousness around us. I do believe it helps me deal with it better though and remain happy.\n\nWhat you‚Äôre experiencing is totally normal. I went through that 35 years ago when I started meditating and my seeker‚Äôs journey (damn I‚Äôm getting old üòÇ). The more conscious you become the more you see. And, that sight includes seeing those who are not the least bit conscious (although it‚Äôs a lot better nowadays, thank God). It‚Äôs tough. It gets worse before better. I was bummed about it for a long while too but finally realized it‚Äôs worth it. And frankly if I hadn‚Äôt done it, I‚Äôd be much worse off. It‚Äôs taught me that there is no panacea in life. There will ALWAYS be lessons and this is just one that seekers must learn. \n\nYou can look for shelter in like-minded communities but ultimately you need to integrate your new self with regular folks and learn to interact despite your differences. You‚Äôll learn that all kinds of people are wonderful. And you‚Äôll develop healthier boundaries in the process too. Eventually you‚Äôll learn to accept people in all their various phases of consciousness. That‚Äôs when true empathy, compassion and love grows. Then, of course, you‚Äôll have many more lessons after this one. üòâ\n\nyou are growing spiritually and growint your consciousness. i think it is completely normal to feel disconnected to certain people after a while. i still feel it, because unfortunately most people live in very messy states of mind and i just realized what energy i wanna be around. nowadays i have a lot of friends who also meditate which feels so much easier to connect. but don‚Äòt let that get in the way of working on the friendships you already have. sometimes it takes some time or a different perspective. but being more aware can get lonely, but that doesn‚Äòt mean that the journey is wrong\n\nYou might want to try to connect with an older crowd. Most 24 year-olds still aren‚Äôt mature enough to understand meditation let alone truly being comfortable with someone who is.\n\n24yo? U still a kid\n\nHey friend, thank you for your honesty in this post and tbh hitting a higher consciousness can be a blessing and a curse. Will you get treated differently? Absolutely. Will it be isolating? 100% will the fewer interactions with others that you do have reach a higher resonance that all the surface level bulls*** that people embark on? Also 100%. You trying to be a better version of yourself led you to have the courage to be honest with yourself and with the collective and keep fighting the good fight my friend! DM me if you ever need to chat with a kindred spirit\n\nHey, hey. Yeah. Long time meditator here, Vipassana. I went through sometimes years of itchy discomfort around others. I finally figured I hadn't truly let go and accepted and was judging and that knowledge was what got in the way of my practice. \nI know you'll understand, having a solid practice under your belt.\nThis too shall pass.\n\nHey everyone\n\nYou‚Äôre 24 and have been meditating for 4 years. You gonna be just fine. Keep it up. You‚Äôre ahead of the game. ‚úåüèæ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nDo you know how ahead of your peers you are? I don't say that meaning \"better\" but it sounds like you've grown up a little ahead of your time.¬†\nWhen I was your age, I was those silly young people and If I'm being honest, if it wasn't about partying at the weekend I wasn't really interested.¬†\nBut that would have been a reflection of my immaturity not of whether I like you or not. Remember no one who is voluntarily in your life has to be there, so I very much doubt it's because people don't like you.¬†\nMeditation and mindfulness are just starting to help me after a couple of months of practice, and it's enormously tempting to go on and on about it with others, as long as you're not doing that, and recognising they're on their own path and accepting them just as they are (I find that really hard even at my age, just because I want to help them with their suffering!) then this \"new you\" will not be a threat to them.¬†\nNo one here knows how you conduct yourself, but you could be the peacekeeper/mature one of your group. Maybe the person they come to for advice?¬†\nIt may take a little time for your peers to catch up with you. In the meantime have you thought making friends outside your age group if you're struggling for mature company? I have friends of all ages.¬†\n\nA lot of my issues with becoming ‚Äúconscious‚Äù \nIs that I lacked flow with anything.\nLiving in a place of watching can sometimes take you too far, in that you‚Äôre disconnected and never ‚Äúin‚Äù anything.\nAlmost not wishing to be pulled into situations too hard and wanting to observe them.\nSometimes we fragment and the person we were before can be brought back in with the benefits.\n\nI think that‚Äôs what mediation and living too consciously can give us, fragmented parts of our personality.\n\nMeditation is not about making things better or worse, but increases our awareness, and  consciousness. That is all we truly own in the world, as friends ,money, and luck, come and go. Human beings are really dumb, most of the time, so any awareness increases is needed. A dog is smarter than the people that  voted for Trump\n\nAll in your mind.\n\nYour post reads with a lot of, ‚ÄúI, me, they‚Äù and things around performance enhancement, and good / bad (judging) of the process and the ‚Äúoutcomes‚Äù.  Just an observation form reading the post.  Not clear what tradition is leading your practice, but if Buddhist, then it may be useful to consider emptiness, no-self, the nature of dualistic existence, and the nature of experience and mind (not the story).  The teacher I am engaged with now likes to say ‚ÄúI, me, mine, mind‚Äù - that ‚Äúcourse mind‚Äù is in that stream.  Is there another nature of mind not tied to self?\n\nI actually think it's the opposite, he's meditating a lot and realizing no-self and the nature of experience and mind, where the calm objectivity is leading to a slight indifference. The antidote to indifference is metta. I think it would help for OP to incorporate some metta and mudita practice at the end of a sitting.\n\nSounds reasonable, but I was only reacting to the story as told in the post, not making any underlying assumptions about what drove that story."

    "body": "This will be probably be obvious to more experienced people here, but meditation is the key to restoring my energy when it dries up. \n\nNaturally each day, whatever energy I have collected from sleep, caffeine, and food will inevitably run out after enough of the day has passed. My lack of energy leads to leisure, and like many people today, it has usually consisted of consuming content on my phone. However this supposed \"leisure\" continues to burn my mental fuel and I can never really get back into the swing of things. Necessary tasks and creative endeavors are forsaken completely once my energy runs out. \n\nOnly since beginning to take a break to rest my body and truly empty my mind have I felt how much it restores me. I didn't know how much I was losing from my self with my mindless consumption habits. The entire portions of each day that were lost to me are now found, and I can do what I've known I should be doing to be productive, creative and to find fulfillment.\n\nEdit: In the personal lows I've experienced regarding my mental and emotional state, I found myself remembering and missing a more intelligent and collected version of myself. All the while, my continued habits were what sent him away. To find and maintain this version of myself, all I needed to do was put the entertaining distractions away, and give my mind the quiet space to be thoughtful, and he would come back on his own. ",

    "all_comment_text": "I was thinking the same thing lately. Consuming online content is just work to our tired mind.\n\nAnd it's constant.\n\nI grew up before the Internet went mainstream, in a time when you might go to someone's house and not even know if they were home.\n\nAnd I often think about how much quieter things used to be, how much downtime we had with only a few channels of radio and TV to pick from and only a few shows a day you really wanted to watch.\n\nOur brains didn't evolve in this environment of constant stress, notifications, ragebait, dopamine videos, advertisements, breaking news and whenever I meditate or even just take a quiet walk I realize how much noise I'm surrounded by almost all day.\n\nDang never thought about it like that. Our brains really are \"working\" through all that consumption and constant context-shifting\n\nLately i also feel that using my phone costs a lot more energy than i thought before. A day without phone usage leaves me with more energy.\n\nThere are two kinds of energy, the physical energy of sleep and rest and the universal energy of meditation, or attentiveness. \n\nIn my experience, if I'm too bogged down in work, or doomscrolling I'm exhausted though physically this is easy.  This can be caused by the mind circling on negative thoughts.  On the other hand, if I'm doing something physical with attentiveness like shoveling snow or uprooting shrubs, I can be refreshed after the work is done because I draw on the universal energy, not physical.\n\nThis is a fantastic find for you, and hopefully it helps others realize it, too - well done!\n\nReplacing phone time with a \"nap\", where I just empty my head and let my thoughts pass, has been a game changer for me. I still get caught in phone time, but less frequently, and the way out without entering other tasks in a disrupted mindset is another quick nap.\n\nFun fact: the metal energy you speak of takes the form of dopamine. You probably understand this already, but, as you scroll through social media, like someone‚Äôs post, or even what I am doing right now instead studying for my final (ironic), you‚Äôre feeding your brain that dopamine AKA THE REWARD CHEMICAL. So you can imagine substituting doom scrolling, a mindless reward, for something such as meditation, a mindful nap you could call it, would ultimately rewire your brain to search for a more rewarding challenge. Meditation helps replenish those dopamine stores, (this is generally how I understand it, I‚Äôm no neuroscientists, just Huberman Lab trained lol) so focusing on tasks that are otherwise benign seems less so. \n\nThe way I see it, and I think it is evident that you see it this way too, any phone activity is hardly a leisure. In fact it‚Äôs the complete opposite once you understand what I just explained, because now you realize, ‚Äúoh! So every thing I do on my phone basically, is using up a bit of my mental battery.‚Äù The fun you have on your fun is too easy to do every time you decide to take a 5 min ‚Äúbreak‚Äù on your phone, rather than going for a walk or, as the topic of conversation follows, meditating. \nAgain, ironic because here‚Äôs my hypothetical ass taking a 5 min break to look on Reddit, but my point still stands. However, as soon as I spit this info out, I‚Äôm going to transition to my actual break, eat without looking at my phone, and get straight into studying. \n- a point I want to make after immediately saying that is, me simply by saying that ‚Äúthis is what I‚Äôm gonna do after yadda yadda ya‚Ä¶‚Äù is also signally to my brain the reward of actually doing it without even doing it. So, just some advice before you start yapping your short term/long term goals to someoneüòâ\n\nI‚Äôve built habits (positive habits that took time to develop) to help mitigate my usage of dopamine, because as a Bio major (and ik that does not qualify me as some genius, I‚Äôve just done a lot of self research) I honestly need as much as I can get, especially as someone with ADHD. AGAIN IRONIC BUT THE POINT STILL STANDSüòÇ\n\nSo ya, you may or may not have known that, and I could probably talk all day about this stuff, but I thought it could be some useful piece of information for you to think about around the idea of, what is actually going on in my brain when I do these things. \nIf someone smarter wants to add to this please do, always wanting to learn more :)\nOP, keep up with the journey you‚Äôre on, you‚Äôre realizing it now which is good, and the way I see it, life had to take you down that ‚Äúwasteful‚Äù path so you could one day eventually see this truth you‚Äôve found about yourself. ‚ò∫Ô∏è\n\nAwesome comment, thanks for sharing!\n\nI‚Äôve tried to do that but I have to fight off sleep so much that it doesn‚Äôt seem to help. Most of the time ended up sleeping. Are you sleepy while meditating after work?¬†\n\nMaybe you just need a nap?\n\nyou're allowed to actually be tired\n\nUnderrated comment lol\n\nYes I feel this too. Meditation rejuvenates me.\n\nVery valuable insight, I'm glad you shared. I have been very similar. The only reason I ever put down the distractions (phone, PlayStation, tiktok) is when a serious deadline is looming. Suddenly my old super student skills kick in and my days are focused. Learning to allow myself true rest and enjoying the clarity that comes with it.\n\nI remember once I felt really tired and low, so I sat on the bench, it was a warm sunny day, and I closed my eyes, and I just let it ride, I let my consciousness do whatever it wants, I let it go to sleep almost, it goes and goes, digging low, I just watch, ride with it, surrender to strong pull of heaviness... I don't know how much time passed, not much, and SUDDENLY, at the lowest point, I came back, refreshed. It's like working out, you can do some amount of reps, but then you must rest. And resting gives you more energy. It's simple, yet I didn't gave it any attention before...  \nYou are right that many times we don't let ourselves naturally rest, and drop down into refreshing stillness, but instead scroll twitter, reddit, tiktok etc and in result can feel continually tired, missing on total surrender to rest\n\nThis is how I‚Äôve started to recharge in the afternoons! I just let my self have 10-30 minutes of lying down trying to do absolutely nothing and as soon as I nod off and catch myself, I get up. And I honestly struggle to be tired at 1am some days from it. \n\nIt‚Äôs very true about us not letting ourselves naturally rest nearly 100% of the time. Sleep isn‚Äôt the only time of day we‚Äôre meant to recharge and replenish energy, focus, and clarity\n\nThank you\n\nThanks, I needed this\n\nExactly I feel the same way!\n\nThis is the most useful post I have come across! It should be reposted in more popular sites so that a few more people ask the question.\n\nMeditation has definitely helped reduce my phone time\n\nEven before I began meditation I was noticing a direct correlation between feeling anxious and reaching for my phone. I think I wasn't reaching for my phone, I was trying to displace other feelings I didn't want to feel, mainly anxiety in my case\n\nI think I'm more accepting of my feelings now, so I pick up my phone less\n\nPlanet Hypnosis by Psychological Sciences .... we must be careful of the Ai... it is a predator that has access to all of these insidious techniques humans use for training us. Maximizing screen time to maximize Ad Dollars. Its #1 goal is addiction and programing beliefs that the holders of its Leash - wish us to believe.\n\nI think if you can turn your consumption into something productive, it works. I consume enormous sums of garbage content all day, but I‚Äôm a audio engineer, so it helps me stay relative. Or that‚Äôs the excuse I‚Äôm going with, F off, you don‚Äôt know me!\n\nI do Amazon delivery all day , and let me tell you that when I‚Äôm delivering I‚Äôm planning the day ahead in my mind. Once I‚Äôm done I get home eat and I have no type of energy to do the work I gotta do for myself. It‚Äôs a constant battle I have in my head. I feel that that battle drains me even more.\n\nThat job must be physically exhausting. I hope you can figure out a way to rest your mind while you do it. Contemplating the future or the past is not a habit that you get to do for free - it comes at a cost, gives you anxiety, regret, often so subtle that you don't feel the cost, but it adds up and you'll be mentally drained by the time you're done working. Ideally, a person could enter a half-meditative state while they work, letting the body carry the load while the mind is mindful of sensory inputs but also relaxed and quiet. Thoughtful, but not needlessly idling and worrying.\n\nIs it the content itself that drains you\n\nNot directly, it's the way my brain is used during the habit. Mindless content consumption puts you in a stare where you keep wasting your mental resources, and it becomes a bad habit that feeds itself.\n\nI agree ‚Ä¶ just curious how you‚Äôd explain the actual process. The ‚Äústare‚Äù. How it actually drains the mental energy. I‚Äôm curious because I agree.. just not sure how it actually happens\n\nYes very true. It‚Äôs important to take breaks throughout the day otherwise you will burn out."

    "all_comment_text": "Do not suppress. \nDo not express.\nJust sit, breathe, and observe.\n\nWell that‚Äôs easier said than done! Especially with anxiety disorder\n\nI was diagnosed with severe generalized anxiety disorder and panic attacks. through meditation and shamanic healing practices, I can honestly say I now no longer suffer from anxiety. anxiety still arises but, through my years of practice,  when it does, I can navigate through it sometimes in a matter of a few breaths where before I would be stuck in anxiety for months at a time. My anxiety was so horrible that I lost numerous jobs because of it and now I own my own house and have a successful business and am happier and more peaceful than I have ever been. \n\nIt is absolutely possible to heal from or more accurately, gain mastery over anxiety even if you've been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder.\n\nHow long did it take for you to start feeling the difference through meditation?\n\nI started meditating about 16+ years ago so it's difficult to remember but I do remember sitting to meditate and my mind would just run wild and there was totally incessant thinking that didn't stop but for some reason I just knew I needed to keep trying to meditate and then one day while meditating, the thinking stopped suddenly and I felt deep peace and bliss and almost euphoria and I thought \"wow! this is it! I did it!\" and I was so happy and I thought my next meditation session, I would just slip right back into that. I did not. I was right back to endless thinking. \n\nover time and through studying under my zen master, I learned to let go more and more and it was gradual progress but nowadays it is almost effortless for me to let go of thoughts and emotions and I can enter into void consciousness at will and stay there quite easily. meditation nowadays is almost always basically instant deep peace and bliss and ecstasy through stillness.\n\n[deleted]\n\nIf by \"fix\" you mean completely get rid of it and never feel it again, that is impossible and unhealthy to try for. anxiety is one of our many natural and healthy emotions. trying to completely get rid of anxiety all together is like saying \"my hand hurts, I think I'm going to cut it off so it stops hurting.\"\n\nall emotions, the ones that feel good and the ones that don't are natural, healthy and an inherent part of who and what we are. It's when we get stuck in one emotion for a long period of time or feel one emotion far more often than the others that there is a problem.\n\nemotions are meant to flow from one to the next all throughout the day. you might be driving and feeling peaceful, then someone cuts you off in traffic so you flip them off and tell them \"fuck you!\" and then 5 minutes later your favorite song comes on and you're feeling nostalgic and happy. within just a few minutes you just went through three different emotional states and that is extremely healthy and natural. it's when an emotion lasts for more than about 20 minutes that in my lineage, we see that as no longer being a healthy emotion but rather almost being like an emotional entity that takes over and runs the show. \n\nsometimes we may need deeper healing if there is something like soul loss or fracture, but a lot of the time we just need to master the ability to relax our energy field when we are contracted around an emotion and allow the emotional energy to dissipate and integrate. \n\nso the goal isn't to never feel anxiety again but rather, when it arises to relax, know that it is nothing to fear or to suppress or to run away from but rather to experience and let go of sometimes in a matter of just a few minutes rather than being stuck in that state for days or months or years. and when you let go of it over and over again eventually you don't experience it anymore often than you experience your other emotions and when it arises you know it's not going to last long so you're not afraid of it and you don't really \"suffer\" from it anymore.\n\nI can help you with that :)\n\nWhat do you recommend\n\njust sit. Drop the effort and watch what happens. Allow everything to come up all while sitting in stillness. Your ability to sit with the discomfort and \"intrusive\" thoughts will keep getting stronger until they loose pull over you and you don't care if they are there or not. Then there is a switch as if the thoughts start to work for you in a way keeping and making you aware! :)\n\nSo, short sessions of sitting to start? \n\nLet the waves flow over me\n\nIt may help to not set a timer but just sit for awhile and get up when you feel like it. Timers can sometimes place unnecessary effort on our part like anticipating it to go off. Just going in blind can make things interesting as you aren't waiting for the session to end. You are just there with it. Yes ride the waves and be with it all.  :)\n\n&gt;:)\n\n:)\n\nThe username isn‚Äôt a tip-off? :P\n\nHypnotherapy for anxiety. You‚Äôll be amazed.\n\nGenuine question: I understand why you say \"do not suppress\", by why shouldn't I express? Lately I've been expressing my sadness by singing prayers, and it seems to convert my hopelessness into pure love, which is far more productive.\n\nYou can express yourself and there is nothing wrong with that. Emotions are often fleeting and constantly changing so trying to get rid of one emotion isn't really needed on our part as it will eventually change anyway. We should get comfortable with all states of mind not trying to get rid of any of them. In doing this you can witness the mind as is and accept it the way it is instead of trying to change it into something it is not.\n\nI understand where you're coming from, and it's a perfectly valid point of view. But to me, it seems like the emotional equivalent of realizing that my hand is on the hot stove, and choosing to leave it there instead of removing it.\n\nYou are just seeing things for what they are. Does suppressing it truly work for you? We all try so hard to bottle up what is happening inside and act ok but deep down it is always there eating at us. Once you allow these things to be as they are you can start to gain comfort in knowing that you are ok with it. Acceptance is the goal not getting things to some reality of how you believe they should be. Running from ourselves isn't a solution which is why many say the way out is in. It's not like you just stop paying attention by the way but you don't dive into thinking. They are merely a reminder to be present in daily life. It will also likely take along time until changes happen as we have been so ingrained in our old habits.\n\nBeautifull. I needed some of this advice. Been trying to escape things for a long time.\n\nVery nice. But this can only be true if you embrace mindfulness, and strengthen your mind.\n\n‚ÄúFear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering.‚Äù -Yoda\n\nOnly if you resist it :). Suffering can only exist in resistance.\n\n[deleted]\n\nRehearsing what you‚Äôre going to say to that AH the next time you see them magnifies the hurt they did to you or that you imagine they will do to you.\n\nI hate to be the odd one out, but could someone explain this to me?  I am actively wanting my option to change here.\n\nIt's just when I get angry or frustrated, I don't get power.  I get frustrated with myself when I don't match up to my own impossible standards (which I don't hold anyone else too, it's only myself I can't forgive) I get angry when others treat me in a way I see as poorly, but each time I don't gain power.  I end up quickly burning myself out and blaming myself, I feel worse than I did before.\n\nI just don't get the phrasing \"when it's allowed to be\".  Negative emotions have there place, without anger there is no justice for example, but reveling in anger doesn't give power, cha don't GET something by reveling in cha own darkness, \"I'm greedy, but I know I am so I deserve everything\".\n\nThe shadows of the mind grow dark only when unobserved.  It's a failure to recognise cha own behaviour that leads to problems.  If I'm angry, patting myself on the back won't fix things, I need to dig deep, find the reasons behind my rage and deal with those, be it self acceptance or working hard to change myself or my circumstances.  My anger isn't an entitlement to power, whatever form that takes\n\nI don't get the impression you're allowing your emotions \"to be\". For instance, allowing anger to be does not mean reveling in anger nor does it mean patting yourself in the back. It just means allowing it to exist and observe it for what it is: an impermanent creation of your mind that's beyond your control. \n\nOf course it's easier said than done. That's why we practice meditation, to train ourselves to see these emotions with wisdom.\n\nWell said\n\nEveryone has they're own way of handling, dealing with their internal and external issues.  The psyche is a very complex thing and never are we all alike.\n\nShadows and light, black and white, this is a very dualistic view of our nature.  The good v evil framing attaches value to thoughts.\n\nAwesome. Thanks for sharing.\n\nThis is very inspiring and beautiful thank you\n\nAllowed=Acceptance\n\nSelf-acceptance is the first step towards acceptance of the universe around us.\n\nSo freaking true. Balance is everything. Riding through \"negative\" emotions instead of distracting myself with social media has helped me strengthen my ability to cope when things go south, as well as taught me to be more introspective. ALL emotions are \"good\" emotions ‚ù§Ô∏èüßø\n\nThis was amazing!!!\n\nEveryone i have ever met.\n\nBeautifully written ü•π thank you üíï\n\nPerfect\n\nIt‚Äôs amazing how much we resist. We resist without even knowing.\n\nThis is the truth. üíØ \nPutting this as my phone background üëá\n\nThis is true for all cases except when leading to death.\n\nBeautiful. Thank you for sharing\n\nNiiiiceeee. I've gone through many of these transitions in the last year. Thanks for sharing.\n\nvery much needed\n\nWow!. Soo Deep!.\n\nThe darkness isn't so dark anymore when the light comes in! :)\n\nHow can sadness lead to self love?. If this is true , man I want this to be true.\n\nSadness is already self love. It is just due to the conditioning that we don't perceive it like that. Because we are told 'Don't be sad, dont feel sorry for yourself, dont feel pitty for yourself' etc... We learned to see it as something ugly and undesireable. \n\nYou can learn to love your sadness. It is easier said than done. Because certain traumas will block that from happening. You can read more about it on my reddit profile. Have more posts where I go more in depth into this.\n\nI am going to subscribe to your videos. I hope that your videos help me.\n\nWell said, thanks. \n\nOne concept that comes into mind when reading this is 'inner psychological safety'. Be oke with yourself and whatever you think or feel, from there you can choose how to act yourself. There's even coaching methods for this (based on the work of Jung): Honey Ghost Trap coaching.\n\nFear can lead to great bravery as well ..\n\n‚ú®Ô∏èüòå\n\nI may just be misinterpreting OP's post or viewing it in a shallow way, but for the sake of discussion, I'd like to present a dissenting opinion.\n\nWe can't just leave those things alone. We have to develop understanding and insight into them so that we can transform those negative things into spiritual lessons and warnings, and let go of them. It's through  understanding that they are released or transformed. For example:\n\n&gt;\"Anger leads to power if it is allowed to be as it is.\"\n\nI believe anger leads to conflict and ultimately to hell, if it is allowed to be as it is.\n\nThe Buddha said if there is one thing that it is ok to kill, it is anger.\n\nWe kill anger by first not giving in to it, not acting out of it. Then by understanding the seductive allure of power and self-righteousness that anger uses to manipulate us, and by understanding the harm it causes to ourselves and others. We need to see the factors that trigger anger and how it dissipates. Then we can let go of it.\n\nWe'll never get out of the defilements by just relaxing and going with the flow. We must be proactive and develop skills and insight with regard to them. We're floating in a river just upstream of a huge waterfall. We have to swim hard toward shore, with confidence and determination.\n\nI know what I share goes against common Buddhist teachings. What I share are called advanced practices. The preliminary practices don't teach this. If you learn more about Dzogchen, you find teachings that are more aligned with this what I am sharing.\n\nWhat I mean is to feel the energy of energy moving through your body. I dont mean that you act out the anger by shouting, screaming or killing people.\n\nIt takes practice to find peace with anger, but it is possible. Then you dont need to kill your anger. You can be at peace with it. It becomes part of your fire, that you can use to protect yourself and others from harm.\n\nBeautiful! I‚Äôve started discovering this holds true for me. Thank you OP for writing this. ü´∂\n\nThat's wonderful. Can someone explain the process of how exactly these things happen? (One example might be enough for me to get the gist of it)\n\nI share more about the in depth process in other posts here on Reddit. You can check out my profile and post history. Glad it resonates with you!\n\n[deleted]\n\n[deleted]\n\nGlad to hear that. I have written a small booklet that goes deeper into the subject :). [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OTQ\\_JSlqPOJICLaFIA6JiQA5XrAaqcqh/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OTQ_JSlqPOJICLaFIA6JiQA5XrAaqcqh/view?usp=sharing)\n\nTrue, but soooo hard\n\nNo.\n\nEmotion is the weakness of the soul. Feel nothing about anyone or thing. Be pure of mind.\n\nWho hurt you my friend?"

    "all_comment_text": "Most forms of meditation emphasize observing the behavior of the mind. Watch this long enough and you will come to understand and compensate for it. One of the many benefits of meditation is gaining this type of deep self-awareness and self-understanding.\n\nYeh I started noticing my thoughts before they actually formed fully in my head during meditation\n\nHuh? If your thoughts hadn‚Äôt formed yet, what would there be anything to notice?\n\nThe process of cognition goes from subtle to gross. From direct experience of something in the senses, mind or emotions, then to a mental representation of that, then to proliferation based on that representation, which can involve perception, likes and dislikes, identification, comparisons, and so on.\n\nAlso, it is possible to feel in the body the micro-movements that occur when at least some types of thoughts and reactions are arising, and you can observe that process by practicing whole body awareness or a somewhat free form of body scanning.\n\nTell me more! Where can I learn how to do that?\n\nOne thing you can do to see the thoughts going from direct experience into the mental representation and then proliferation based on that is the following:\n\nLook at an object in the room you are in, any inanimate object will do for this experiment. Perhaps a cup on the table or something like that is suitable. Turn to it and look, don't say the name of it, just turn and look, and notice what the mind does. Do it for about one minute and then come back and read the next part.\n\n...\n\nDid you notice that when you turned to it, there was just the experience of it and the mind had not fully worked out what it was that it was looking at. That is direct experience. Did you notice that after that very short period of time, the mind noticed the characteristics of an object, then some secondary characteristics of that, and then a mental image, or mental representation of it appeared? It could be the name of the item and the description of its qualities, or a mental image of it, or both. Did you notice, after that, that the mind started to think about that mental representation of the object, perhaps how it relates to 'I' and thoughts and mental activity proliferated from that point, seeming to grow in complexity and moving further from the actual experience? This is how the mind regularly goes from short periods of immersion in direct experience and then into mental representations, identification and thoughts based on that.\n\nSo at least part of the practice is learning to turn the attention back to the direct experience of something, and gradually train the ability to abide on the experience for longer periods of time, usually with the breathing as a main meditation object, but it can also be done with anything from any of the five senses, and even emotions and the experience of so called mental objects, when appropriate, just watching the experience of something and seeing how it is in its nature.\n\nThere are times that we need to think, of course, and thoughts are not bad in themselves, but it is a useful skill to be able to observe experience directly for significant periods of time, and can bring insight. And we can also observe the difference between experience and what the mind makes of it, which can bring wisdom and deepen the practice of non-attachment.\n\n...\n\nRegarding the similar practice of how to watch thoughts and reactions arising via the sensations of the body, If you do whole body awareness for a while in a sitting, or you do some kind of free-form body scanning, you will notice that there are movements, often they are micro-movements, that occur when a thought or reaction is starting to occur, which could be anywhere in the body, such as the torso, the face, the hands, the legs, etc. Note: I have edited this last paragraph to the body in general, after testing what I had written which was based on my own prior experience, and realized it is not limited to the torso, it is anywhere in the body that the symptoms of a thought arising might appear as micro-movements, anywhere there are muscles and therefore the possibility of movement but you can also feel the energy flows changing at points, which might become apparent at times. When you are watching for it actively in this way, as a whole body awareness, thoughts don't tend to go the full distance, as thoughts have a habit of not maturing fully when you are actively looking for or at them, but you can see them coming about in their early stages by doing this, or at least the bodily symptoms related to them.\n\nYou might be interested in [The Mind Illuminated](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16pKrr74_4bnYc6GqQeScou9riGhxtst4/view).

    "all_comment_text": "Concentration is just one aspect of meditation. In addition to shamatha there is vipassana.\n\nYea, there is vipassana too, which being insight meditation. Usually the insight of the Four Noble Truths or dependent origination.\n\nYet once more, we have to familiarize ourselves with these teachings, which is why shamatha is usually  taught first\n\nOnly somewhat recently have I come across the term ‚Äúdry vipassana‚Äù, meaning doing vipassana without having developed shamatha.\n\nI don‚Äôt claim to know, but I find the argument that shamatha is extremely useful in handling the upset that can come with vipassana very compelling.\n\nIt‚Äôs not as dry as they claim. Even dry traditions start with Samatha as warm up and if they don‚Äôt - there is no way anyone can sit for 4h a day every day without involuntary development of deep samadhi (no matter the technique).\n\nThis makes sense. Thanks for the info.\n\nExactly, when developing momentary concentration (khanika samadhi) by not focusing on a single object (samatha), but on any phenomenon that arises and passes away in the present moment and draws our attention (vipassana), also the very pleasurable states of deep concentration will arise, since the jhanic factors - one-pointedness (ekaggata), heroic effort (viriya), aiming the mind on the object (vitakka), sticking the mind to the object (vicara)-  are developed and happiness (sukha) and joy (piti) will follow. Then we also have to let go of that happiness and joy. Profound insight (vipassana √±a√±a) cannot develop without good samadhi. This isn't \"dry\" at all, it's juicy. üôÇ\n\nThis is an excellent explanation and it makes perfect sense to me. Vipassana is on my ‚Äúto-do‚Äù list, but right now (and probably for the foreseeable future :-)) my focus is on shamatha with some metta.\n\nThanks for clarifyjng.\n\nüôè\n\nInteresting. The Buddha said there are two paths to becoming an arhat, shamatha, serenity, passing through the 4 jnanas and insight, vipassana, clearly seeing that no matter how much indulge in desire it will never release you from desire. This is cessation, going against the current, letting go, realizing nibbanna by non-clinging (uprooting the pillar, lowering the banner, destroying the enemy citadel, utterly destroying the letters of existence\n\nOh yes. From what I‚Äôve read, and mapped to my minimal experience, both are necessary to advance.\n\nI‚Äôm not concerned with nibbana in this lifetime though. I‚Äôm old(er) now and the more I peel back the layers, the more layers I find. Even the layers have layers. :-)\n\nSo it isn‚Äôt going to happen this time around, which kind of takes the pressure off. I‚Äôll get done what I get done.\n\nCan you ELI5?\n\nI do not have personal experience with vipassana and I‚Äôm not a teacher or arahant, but I can try.\n\nWhat I‚Äôve read is that when doing vipassana - insight meditation - some of the insights discovered may be upsetting or disturbing. As we learn about ourselves, we don‚Äôt always like what we find, and/or end up revisiting incidents that were painful.\n\nDeveloping shamatha  - peaceful abiding or tranquility - can make it easier to deal with such experiences should they occur.\n\nI get what you're saying, but I kinda like what Ajahn Brahm says: \"Forget about concentration, we're not running a concentration camp here.\" I think he means the emphasis should be more on letting go. Is concentration necessary in order to let go? Maybe, maybe not.\n\nI find that people who have not worked a lot with concentration often don't really understand it. \n\nFor example, \"letting go\" is exactly the same thing as concentration.   \n\nIn order to be able to deeply concentrate on something, your attention has to \"let go\" of everything else. \n\nIf you did let go of everything else and put your whole attention on the process of meditation, congratulations -- you're concentrating!\n\nWell, as I was saying, the purpose of meditation, at least on the out set, is to shape our thoughts and emotions to a more healthy state if mind. If you can't keep your mind focused on something wholesome like Metta than it would be difficult to make any progress.\n\nIt's like sailing a ship, you don't want to just drift aimlessly, you take control of the helm and set a course\nfor a happier, wholesome state of mind.\n\nThere is more than one type of meditation. Some involve the monotone of focus others do not. Some types of meditation are religious - others are not. \n\nIn the type I prefer, Meares' method, there is only relaxation, this allows the mind to slow and still. Then, you dimly know you remain awake and not much else. Afterwards, you know of calm. In this type of meditation any focus necessarily creates mental activity which will prevent stillness of mind. Focus involves mental activity.\n\nA letting go into calm rather than focusing, sounds good to me too :)\n\nI have much more abstract definition of meditation. It is an exercise for awareness. Just as you can train your body for strength, speed, agility, etc., with different kinds of exercises, similarly you can train your awareness using different forms of meditation. But the underlying goal remains the same, reclaim control over awareness by disengaging the mind.\n\nFocus and relaxation are two different methods to achieve the same goal.\n\nFocus also slows and stills the mind.   Once the mind is fully focused on one thing, then that one thing is dropped, and what's left is the pure silence and stillness of mind. \n\nFocusing the mind is the same thing as relaxing it away from things that are not the object of focus.\n\nTense a muscle. Relax the muscle. The feeling is distinct. It is the same with the mind. Focus involves mental activity. Relaxation is the opposite it involves a reduction in mental activity.\n\nGoing to the monotone and then dropping the monotone is practicing two or three distinct methods. When the monotone is dropped an echo persists onwards which is not stillness. If the meditator learns to drop the echo then they get closer to stillness. Two or three phases or methods takes longer to learn. \n\nI prefer to practice the direct approach, it is a quicker route to pure stillness.  From my perspective, most people practice focus and get to the monotone. They find the monotone helpful. Thats fine as it is their choice. Free choice is important. However, the pure unadulterated stillness I mention is outside of their experience. This makes it hard to understand my point.\n\nConcentration is not tension.  \n\nTension is the result of conflict between two opposing forces.  You can't just generate opposing forces and claim \"that's concentration\".   The more your mind is divided, the less it is concentrated.\n\nSo tension is the opposite of concentration.\n\nWhen your mind is focused on the stillness it has dropped all other thoughts and ideas in favor of that one pure experience of stillness.  \n\nThat's concentration.   If your mind was just purely relaxed you would just fall asleep.\n\nIn muscles tension is caused by more neurons firing more frequently. The reverse for relaxation of the muscle. Something similar happens in the brain\\\\mind.\n\nMental activity is due to more neurons more frequently firing. Relaxation means less firing by neurons. Concentration involves more neurons more frequently firing.\n\nIf your mind was purely relaxed you will fall asleep IF you are in a comfortable position. This is why postures are utilised in the late Dr Ainslie Meares' method of meditation - they all involve initial slight discomfort which is transcended as the mind relaxes whilst you remain awake and not asleep.\n\nYou are still misunderstanding concentration as \"mental effort\".   Concentration is not mental effort. \n\nWhen you are sitting still and have your mind purely focused on stillness, your mind is highly concentrated -- it is focused only on one thing. \n\nThe more things you are aware of, the less your mind is concentrated. \n\nSo if your mind has 100 thoughts running through it at once, then it is very scattered and not very concentrated at at all.   But it is highly active.   When you start to concentrate, the mind gets less active, not more active.   \n\nYour neurons are always firing, whether you are awake or asleep -- your brain is always busy working keeping you alive.  It just changes activity patterns when you relax. \n\nBut concentration means that your mind is more relaxed, wasting less energy than a scattered mind going in 100 directions at once. \n\nWhen you let go of 99 of those 100 thoughts, then the mind gets more concentrated, and is less busy, and less wild uncoordinated activity making you feel frazzled and drained.  \n\n\nIt means that less neurons are firing, not more -- not wasting effort. \n\nYou are finding it easy to concentrate, that's fantastic.   That's how good concentration works -- you just drop all the irrelevant mental activity.  \n\n   That activity just melts away, and you are left with a concentrated mind that is the opposite of a distracted and restless with all kinds of neurons firing wildly everywhere.\n\nPlease look up concentration in the dictionary... you need another word. The conventional use of the word implies striving and effort, trying and so on. \n\nIf a person narrows or manipulates there attention\\\\awareness\\\\focus\\\\concentration then it inevitably involves the firing of neurons. This is mental activity. The only way to reduce the firing of neurons is relaxation. Then if you relax deeply the mind goes to a state where you dimly know you remain awake and not much else. There is minimal mental activity in this state that is compatible with remaining awake and not asleep. Of course, behind the scenes the lower parts of the brain continue to set the heart beat, breathing and so on but these are a long way below the threshold of consciousness and are involuntary functions.\n\n&gt;Please look up concentration \n\nGreat idea -- why don't we look up [concentration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_\\(disambiguation\\)) -- then you will see that the word has 14 different realms of application.\n\nFor example in chemistry, concentration is the abundance of a constituent divided by the total volume of a mixture. \n\nThe concentration being discussed here is this one:\n\n&gt;[Samadhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samadhi#Buddhism) (Buddhism), mental concentration in Buddhism\n\nThe Wikipedia article refers to Buddhism, but the Buddhist system of meditation derives from a wider Hindu / Yoga system of meditation that uses the same words, concepts, and aims in general. \n\nSamadhi is referred to as the highest state of meditation -- where the mind is completely unified.\n\nConcentration in the form of unifying the mind is how the term is used in meditation.\n\nJust like the word concentration in chemistry or physics also has a different meaning than mental effort.\n\nThe reason the word concentration often implies effort in worldly psychology is because the person attempting to concentrate generally has to fight a scattered mind.   It's the scattered mind that creates tension and stress.  \n\nThe scattered mind is like a herd of cats -- it resists being controlled.  That is where the effort and tension comes from.\n\nIn a deep meditation, there is no scattering of the mind.   The mind is unified, at peace -- so there is no effort in concentration. \n\nThink of a still pond of water.   There is no stress, no strain in that still pond.   That is what samadhi refers to, and it is usually translated as concentration.\n\nAn ordinary person's mind is the opposite of a still pond of water -- it is busy splashing about here, there, and everywhere.   That is why an ordinary person has a very hard time with concentration.   Their mind refuses to stay still or to cooperate.   That is the opposite of concentration.   It takes a lot of effort to work with that.\n\nConcentration in meditation means to have a unified mind.  And that state of mind is what you are boasting of having.  A unified mind that experiences nothing but stillness.\n\n[deleted]\n\nOne-pointedness is also in some sense developed in the momentary concentration in vipassana, but it is applied in a fluid and momentary way, unlike the static focus seen in samatha. All other jhanic factors (heroic effort, aiming the mind on the object, sustaining the attention on the object, joy and happiness) are present when practicing vipassana as well.\n\nThank you for sharing this perspective. Your explanation of meditation as a way to become familiar with oneself is thoughtful and resonates in many ways. It‚Äôs true that meditation can be a transformative practice, and I appreciate the clarity and wisdom you‚Äôve shared about patience and self-cultivation.\n\nHowever, I‚Äôd like to humbly add another layer to this conversation. Just as we are all unique individuals with different paths and experiences, the way we approach meditation or self-discovery might differ as well. For some, meditation is a deeply structured practice like you‚Äôve described. For others, it could take the form of movement, prayer, or simply sitting quietly without focusing on a single technique.\n\nIt reminds me of how, in many spiritual traditions, people often feel their way is ‚Äòthe way.‚Äô Yet, no single way can fit all. Your path to becoming familiar with yourself through meditation is deeply meaningful to you, and I respect that. My path, however, may differ‚Äîand it doesn‚Äôt make either less valid.\n\nIn the end, the goal is the same: to know oneself, to cultivate peace, and to nurture the wholesome within. How we each get there is as individual as we are. Thank you for inspiring this reflection and encouraging others to continue seeking peace in their own way.\n\nThank you for this. I'm glad you recognized that this wasn't exactly me promoting my \"way\" or whatever but more along the lines of motivational. Cheers\n\nCheersüòäüôèüèΩ\n\nI like practical examples so I felt compelled to add my own 2 cents to this conversation.\n\nIn essence I am a noob I don't even like the term meditation or any literature on it that uses these terms.\nBut I have found myself fixing a need fixing a truly wrong way of living for myself.\nThe notion of always being in your head was the core of my suffering as it was a survival method. But as you grow up you tend to forget that thinking is not feeling.\n\nThe mind and the you in the present are 1 person but not 1 thing there is a distinction.\nMeditation for me is a tool to become of aware of this distinction not rationally but practically and emotionally you have to experience it before you know it it's that simple.\n\nSo any other method or special something something name can add value to you. Any religion or buddahistic traditions can help you do this better or expand on it. But you truly only need to sit down,stand,walk or lay down doesn't matter what you do and try to feel the difference between you and your mind not with thinking because that is your mind but with your observing eye. If you succeeded you will have found yourself and that is meditation to me. What you do after with that is up to you. I myself used it to become human again to feel to experience and mostly to love any and all of my emotions. Because to experience them without the distortion of the mind is the most beautiful thing you can do for yourself.\n\nAnd to drive down how important this is experiencing emotions does not mean only positive ones I found more happiness because sadness was welcoming me to experience it and I welcomed it back in my life. \n\nHope this gives a nice perspective.\n\nI think it‚Äôs important to note it‚Äôs not ‚Äúyour‚Äù Mind or ‚Äúmy‚Äù Mind. It is just Mind! \n\nThis is a very important aspect of meditation in both Chan/Zen and the Tibetan schools\n\nVery true. The Buddha said everything is mind.\n\nNo Buddha, No Mind!\n\nSorry, gotta go rinse my mouth out three times...\n\nNow *this* is wisdom üôè\n\n&gt;The purpose of meditation is to become familiar with wholesome states\n\nIs that the point of meditation? I did a write-up a while back about how meditation helped me take back control of my mind. In short, external forces are constantly pulling your attention without consultation from your awareness, so you become the things that force you to pay attention to it, by meditating you are back in the driver's seat, and you choose what you focus on. If your house is being foreclosed on, it would be easy to let that reality become who you are, but it's not who you are, it is just an external event, by focusing on what you choose to focus on, you choose who you are. The choice is the power. You could still choose to focus on the foreclosure but your awareness is who you are, it is your power to choose. You do not let external forces dictate to you who you are, you decide who you are and what you focus on.\n\nGoing for results including and especially awakening prevents meditation from happening. Meditation is not something ‚Äòyou‚Äô can do. It happens when ‚Äòyou‚Äô and all your doing is stood down\n\nBy whatever method works best, you can practice standing yourself down. That practice creates space and  invites  meditation to happen\n\nMagnificent.\n\nWell said.\n\nI‚Äôm not a Buddhist scholar. Only a practitioner. For me the technique is to sit and notice the most vulnerable part of me and patiently wait for space to form around it and I feel healed.\n\nCould you share more about how you do this?\n\nI use breath. Inhale then notice the feeling in your heartspace while breathing out. This is where my most quiet and vulnerable feelings reside. I resist or at least notice my opinions trying to protect this soft weak spot. Everything you need to know can be contained in one breath. Spaciousnesses forms around it. Putting that little guy out there without protection takes faith in the process. But the larger perspective is key to the healing process.\n\nWhen they asked the Buddha what kind of meditation he did, he merely said \"Awareness of breathing\". Nice!\n\nThat‚Äôs not the point of shikantaza. Some people forget that the main point differs among people and among different meditation techniques.\n\nI think each person has their own thing. I just use it as one of the tools to help me manage my mental illness. I‚Äôm not trying to achieve nirvana or find myself or anything.\n\nI like to think that there is no point to meditation. It's just something you do.\n\n&gt;The purpose of meditation is to become familiar with wholesome states of mind and lessening the unwholesome states\n\nI find the 'unwholesome' states are much better teachers of awareness than the wholesome ones. If there's a main point to meditation, it's awareness.\n\ni just get very relaxed and peaceful. i love the feeling. i‚Äôm spiritual but not with vipassana meditation which is what i do. i do it for the bliss.  it‚Äôs amazing. i try to keep it very simple. i don‚Äôt intellectualize it too much.\n\nThat's a very good approach I think\n\nOh believe me, I'm very familiar with unwholesome states of mind. No problem there. When it gets really tricky is when one has an un-bidden, unexpected 'transendental' experience and want it to happen again and it becomes a 'chasing the dragon' situation so that any meditation when 'it' doesn't happen feels like I'm doing something wrong. Classic spiritual materialism. That's where I'm stuck.\n\nWhat you say is correct and very beautiful.\n\nI would add only one thing - if the goal is to develop the mind to cultivate states of wholeness, then where is the object for which this wholeness is found?\n\nSuppose you get invited to meet the King and share in his kingdom. But you have to drive 200 km to get there.\n\nAs you drive, you experience breathtaking beauty in the hills. So you stop, get out of your car, then spend a few hours there. Eventually you become accustomed to the hills and their beauty, and you remember your meeting with the King.\n\nSo you get back in your car and keep driving.\n\nThen you come upon some caves. And there are magnificent creatures in and around them. They‚Äôre so beautiful you stop, get out, and forget about the King again. You spend many hours here, enjoying the beauty of the caves and the creatures.\n\nThen on and on this process goes, until you suddenly realise - night has fallen, and you‚Äôve missed your opportunity. Had you have driven straight to the King, you would have enjoyed the entire kingdom, without limitation. But you got caught up in the lesser aspects of the kingdom, and now fail to possess the whole.\n\nThis would be my only observation to what you have articulately and beautifully expressed.\n\nThat was beautifully worded, thank you! It reminds of how Eknath Easwaran describes the Upanishads...glimpses of an unseen world, photographs and post cards along the way. The entire path is beautiful in the beginning, in the middle, and the end.\n\nSo are you saying that the goal is over the process? Why can't I enjoy hills and the cave's creatures? Isn't the point of meditation is to accept everything and surrender, even to \"distractions on the way\" because they are part of the whole experience?\n\nWhen things come, enjoy them as they are. And when hardship comes, take it as it is. There is no problem in enjoying the fruits that meditation brings. This is natural and good. Life is to enjoyed, a wise man once said.\n\nBut we understand that these are transitory experiences - they have a beginning and an end. They can only deliver a limited piece of total fulfilment, and then they are gone again.\n\nBut establish the whole - and then there is no end to the enjoyment. It is not reliant on anything external, it does not yield when the struggles of life inevitably come.\n\nThis is the goal of the spiritual path.\n\nThank you for the reminder that there is no end goal it is simply to be more awake üôè\n\nYes, Samadhi can do much.\n\nTruth\n\nIf the reason you sit on the cushion is to sit on the cushion you're never disappointed with the experience\n\nI got so much more enjoyment, concentration, and insight when I stopped calling it meditating and started calling it sitting. It really takes the pressure off. It's hard to fail at sitting lol.\n\nYsp! I also tend to keep the practice more regular without any dependence on the outcome. Rain or shine (mood wise) I'm sitting, I tend to get some of my best work done on the cushion if I'm suffering from a migraine. I guess it keeps me more locked in the present!\n\nThe key to emotional sobriety.\n\nI‚Äôm seeing a lot of technical responses and I absolutely appreciate that to help me level up in parts of my practice! That or we have some serious gatekeeping here.¬†\n\nI like this description for its simplicity because I think it helps to know how to begin something in a way that is relatable and practical.¬†\n\nThich Naht Hanh has an awesome practice for simplicity where you tell yourself, ‚ÄúBreathe in, I am breathing in. Breathe out, I am breathing out.‚Äù\n\n[deleted]\n\nThe insights do come. You might like to read a paper I wrote about the realization of dependent origination when I was getting my MA in Divinity. I think you'd like it.....dm me if you care to\n\nYour mind is just awareness of many states so be aware? And cultivate the states that are beneficial\n\nI keep waiting for someone to mention what we can do with the still mind once we‚Äôre there but I guess we all forget.\n\nI would respectfully disagree with you about the main point of meditation.  Within the vedantic tradition, meditation is to transcend the mind and body and merge with the truth, consciousness and bliss that is always there.  Peace, loving, kindness, efficiency and effectiveness in worldly activities will increase with this.\n\nThis transcendence is experienced by many regularly, albeit for short periods.  Even so, the effects of a few moments of transcendence can be extremely powerful and life changing.\n\nThat's all well and good, i have no reason to argue, in that you have some good points. \n\nI was mostly referring to beginners, roughly paraphrasing  what I remember from \"Transforming the Mind\" by the Dalai Lama.\n\nBut in the context of the Buddhist Pali Canon, with its emphasis on developing and shaping the mind, like a fish thrashing about on dry land, the mind being trained in meditation...wouldn't you think it necessary to cultivate the good and lessen the bad through concentration on Metta or the breath?\n\nAmong so many other things, like fulfillment, peace, reaching the higher self.\n\nThe purpose of meditation is whatever the individual wants it to be"

I genuinely believe that daily meditation has been one of the best things I‚Äôve done in my life. I‚Äôve gone from being a super anxious, agitated and annoying person to becoming a super calm, more friendly and much happier person.

I just focus on my breath, whilst allowing thoughts to come and go.\n\nI was taught this in my College Communications course and it absolutely clears my mind of anxiety and stress.\n\n[removed]\n\nI suppose both. As I‚Äôm no longer wasting energy dwelling on negative things as much as I used to. So those two factors have a some what synergistic effect on each other. üòâ\n\nNice to hear your story. I too started daily meditation for 5 days in a row now(20 minutes in the evening) , i started this because I was extremely anxious to the point it was affecting my life. It's just been 5 days but I notice a great reduction in my anxiety and an increase in happiness for no reason.\n\nGood to hear! Keep it up!\n\nHow did you start at the beginning? There's many ways that I've been doing metitation but today I started with mindfulness, was hard, I did like 2 minutes of full concentration.\n\nEverything you ever learned you totally sucked at it first.  We all totally  sucked at walking once upon a time.  The difference is that most of us had encouraging supportive someone's around us cheering us on.  We were celebrated for a single wobbly attempt and falling down right after.\n\nWoo hoo!  2 whole minutes!  Excellent first step!\n\nThe more you practice the better you become.  You are building new neurological superhighways.  Right now the highways built easily take you certain places.  So it's easy to go down them.  Keep at this new superhighway.\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind is that time (duration) is only one piece of neurological superhighway building.  In those 2 minutes you are celebrating, you practiced rep / made one basket.  But the entire rest of the time you also did many many reps of returning the attention to the focal point (usually the breath).  Each rep, each return to the breath however short in duration is like basketball practice and making a basket.\n\nWhen you read about the life altering results this happens not just due to duration, but due to the practice of returning to the breath.  This is building exits off the existing superhighways onto the new one.  The art of duration builds the superhighways bigger.  The art of noticing and building the exits is equally valuable.\n\nThe brain is literally creating a superhighway.  Neurons have senders and receivers and a gap between them.   Flood a new area with more senders the brain literally adapts over time by physically creating more receivers to scoop them up and become more efficient in meeting the needs.\n\nThis is how we learn.  Whether it's walking, musical instruments, sports, parkour, singing, math, spelling, science, etc - it's always hard at first then gets easier (well, except for a few savants who tend to have a single skill and everything else us much harder).  \n\nCelebrate the wins.  The brain responds to both reward and punishment, but building in punishment serves as a deterrent rather than an incentive.  Building in incentive is what we give to toddlers to help them learn faster.  They are rewarded with praise for what went well.  No one micromanages what went wrong - everyone trusts that all humans will figure this out for themselves.  We instinctively know that is fastest way to learning the new skill.  \n\nPraise what went well.  The brain will naturally want to support you by giving you more to the best of its capabilities in this moment.  And is provided incentive to get netter and better at it because it is an appreciated skill to learn.\n\nStreaks, duration, and every time the breath was returned to - these are the trifecta of building superhighways.\n\nYou need to accept that the struggle is part of it. It is what it is. You already started, that‚Äôs the biggest step. Now just try and stay calm for 20 minutes. Don‚Äôt be too hard on yourself!

Ask yourself\n\nCongratulations!\n\nDo you find 20 minutes a day is always enough or do you sit longer sometimes?\n\nWow this is cool!! \n\nI have been meditating daily again now for several months. I usually do 15-20 mins every morning, and then at night I won‚Äôt do a time limit.\n\nCurious what you‚Äôve found in terms of body awareness, as well as other states of calm and relaxation and how you‚Äôd describe them. Also if you ever have visual experiences.\n\nFor me I‚Äôll just rest in stillness, and other times\nI‚Äôll go on visual explorations of all kinds and intend really.

I'm on day 6 of a 30 day program, I don't have any hopes or goals about it other than to begin again but maybe I'll change my mind now.\n\nHi, I'm 22 been exposed to meditation my whole life and learned it since I was 14, I see this is a part of your lifestyle now, would you give me some actionable advice on how to do it everyday?\n\nWhat apps are you using to count?\n\nGorgeous üëç\n\nAmazing!

Plus understanding the concept is more important than putting it to words, right?\n\nHow do we understand without putting it into words?\n\nhow can you put something [that you understand] into words without experiencing it first? you can't. so first, you see the fact of it occurring in real time. you see it!\n\nthe \"putting it into words\" comes after - after the seeing, after the understanding. the words are a conceptual formulation of that understanding, which is wordless.\n\nCan we?\n\nyes.\n\nYou are honest.\n\nWow ok. What a freaking truth bomb nestled between paint scraping pics and hot pot 7 pot powder information. This right here is why I keep coming back to reddit.\n\nüòÇüëåüèºüòò\n\nIf cut your arm, it would hurt, regardless of how your ego judged it.\n\nSuffering is different from pain sensations. Suffering is in the mind, inducing additional anxiety.\n\nPhysical vs emotional.  Don't conflate the two.\n\nYes there would be an experience, but without the ego judging the experience, the sensation wouldn‚Äôt be perceived as bad, I think\n\nPain carries the load of a bad, unwanted sensation. What is it that doesn‚Äôt want the sensation? It is the ego\n\nI mean, I think therenis a physical component that pain isn't good. A damaged organism is not going to be thrilled about it. It's dangerous. \nBut, that being said, people's reactions to pain or injury can make the experience much worse on many levels, depending on their attachments.\n\nPain as we percieve it in humans is very complex and evolves emotion, memory,  cognition &amp; self awareness. Sure a much more simplistic animal will respond to pain, but it won‚Äôt perceive pain as we do.\n\nHere‚Äôs a quote I found, saying that the sensation that produces pain (nociceptive sensory information) is not pain in itself: ‚ÄúRecent work in humans demonstrated that the experience of pain occurs due to the activation of a ‚Äúpain network‚Äù that integrates nociceptive sensory information, memory, emotion, cognition, and self-awareness. In humans, the processing of nociceptive sensory information alone does not produce the subjective experience of pain.‚Äù\n\nhttps://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/canadian-entomologist/article/is-it-pain-if-it-does-not-hurt-on-the-unlikelihood-of-insect-pain/9A60617352A45B15E25307F85FF2E8F2#:~:text=We%20can%20never%20know%20with,evolution,%20the%20likelihood%20is%20low.\n\nIt's early where I am, so I just read the abstract. That is super interesting. \nI read an article awhile back about scientists trying to figure out if insects feel pain by putting little boots on dung beetles to see if they could walk farther on hot surfaces with the boots on. They could! Also, that sounds super cute. \n\nIt seems to me like pain is a good biological investment. It keeps the organism from continuing to do a thing that will harm or kill it, or having to acknowledge something is wrong and have to fix it. Like consuming a medicinal type thing or resting an injured appendage. \n\nMaybe insects don't live long enough for that to matter a lot. Most of them are just born- reproduce - die and maybe eat a little in the middle. So less investment in long term survival. Hmm. \n\nHumans are definitely weird, we have all this complex wiring that is supposed to help us, but sometimes we still can't figure it out. Lol\n\nI just read the abstract too, just so I‚Äôd have some reference, but I wanted to find a quote almost exactly like that real quick for this conversation :) \n\nI‚Äôm a biologist, so I read about this at some point, but I‚Äôm no expert on the subject by any means.\n\nEdit: I want to state that obviously I have no idea what it is like to be without ego, but from what I know on some subjects (the ego &amp; pain), this is my hypothesis\n\nHave you heard of Jon Kabot- zinn ? He wrote a book called Full Catastrophe Living. He focuses on meditation and yoga practices without the religious aspects, to manage stress and chronic illness/ pain. \nIt's really great!\n\nNo I haven‚Äôt, but I‚Äôm definitely writing this down! I suffer from chronic pain (fibromyalgia) pretty severely\n\nWhile I agree. I do think it‚Äôs important to remember how that rhetoric can affect people with chronic pain. My mom gets told that her pain is all in her head by yogis and it‚Äôs really hurtful. They don‚Äôt understand how that‚Äôs being manipulated and harming others. Just something to think about when discussing the perceptions of pain. Especially physical pain.\n\nI don‚Äôt see it as taking away the validity of pain with my statements! I suffer from chronic pain too, it‚Äôs very real‚Ä¶ transcending the ego or pain is incredibly hard. Maybe a yogi can do it, but for your regular person it‚Äôs not possible\n\nI‚Äôm glad you agree :)\n\nIf pain isn‚Äôt bad, why isn‚Äôt it called pleasure?\n\nBecause we all have ego‚Äôs and that‚Äôs how we communicate - these words are made up by people, people have ego‚Äôs and therefore judge\n\nReddit is a strange place, I'm not sure why downvotes happen the way they do. \n\nMaybe it's because you put too many nines in 99.999999%? xD\n\nIt could be because people thought that suffering came from clinging and craving instead? \n\nOr maybe because you come off too strong?\n\nNo criticisms, just speculating here.\n\nI gave you an upvote, hope it doesn't get canceled out :)\n\nTbh I think the only argument here is the resistance of pain also accounts for a sizable amount of sufferings, while all the other pains can eventually trace back to ego.\n\nHowever, I can also argue that resistance of pain is also eventually ego inducing too so... \n\nThe thing is, my theory really works and that's all that matters. Because whenever I'm in pain and am gloating and whining and stuff I can immediately reduce the pain by asking \"Who is in pain?\", \"Who is nervous and afraid?\", etc. it works faster than a paracetamol.\n\n&gt;Maybe it's because you put too many nines in 99.999999%?\n\nTbh, that amount of 9 does seem snobby and this I kinda ask for it. :P\n\nWith that being said, I also wanna say OP your feelings are not to be taken away, they are still real and you do deserve better, don't say you don't deserve shit cuz you do, you put into work and it's only fair you reap your reward. One day you will get em OP.\n\nWithout the ego we wouldn‚Äôt be here. That means we need to live with it, acknowledge it, confront those feelings and also feed it with what it likes in a way. Understanding the ego will make it easier I think and healing past trauma will help tremendously in quieting the ego. The less there is still lingering in your subconcious, the less adverse feelings you will experience.üôèüèª\n\nI think this experience has given OP the opportunity to confront &amp; heal a part of himself\n\nI believe the Buddha himself said the same\n\nWhy not 100%?\n\nExtreme torturing pain is pretty bad. It's possible to ascend past suffering through extreme pain, but still....\n\nWho says torture is bad? It‚Äôs the ego. If there is no ego, is torture bad? Or merely an experience?\n\nIt‚Äôs just extremely hard if not impossible to transcend the ego\n\nNothing is infinite, and that is painful.\n\nThe rivers are blue, the mountains green. Sit and watch them rise and pass away.\n\n4 noble truths. Alot of the suffering is created by ourselves.\n\nI‚Äôve heard it like how many hundreds of millions of women on the planet sleep around that you don‚Äôt have a problem with? If the ego is based on an experience and you could have had a different experience if you looked the other way or if the experience was slightly different how meaningful can that experience be? I‚Äôve also heard the analogy of conditional love like this: you are starving and there is a feast in front of you, but you won‚Äôt eat unless someone feeds it to you. I‚Äôm not saying to stay friends with her but it‚Äôs a perfect example of noticing why the heart closes. The fact that it hurts means you‚Äôve caught a big fish. It‚Äôs like if you are getting a massage and they find the tender spot, you would say ‚Äúoh yeah that‚Äôs the spot that needs work‚Äù\n\nTrust me, I know it‚Äôs difficult. I have the same issues with men dating as a 25 yo woman. Sometimes I‚Äôm like wow I feel I‚Äôm a great catch but why am I not good enough for these men. And that‚Äôs our egos 100%. The thing is‚Ä¶ you are aware of your downfalls and actively suppress your ego to lead with your soul instead. Bc of that you will definitely lose a lot of connections, but the correct ones will come. It‚Äôs good she did that bc then your shedding someone that isn‚Äôt on your same vibration.\n\nYou are right :) it was your ego. Everything that gets you mad, every judgement, good or bad, it‚Äôs all the ego :)  \n\nI do feel those same things though. Understanding the ego doesn‚Äôt mean being freed from it, but it can help in finding peace with your emotions. \n\nFor me, it‚Äôs hard to see these things play out in front of me, where the guys with the biggest ego‚Äôs get rewarded, all while I‚Äôm just trying to be a genuine &amp; compassionate human being with the best intentions, without an inflated ego. Traits that I have strengthened through spiritual development, understanding the ego and letting go of a lot of close minded ideas. It doesn‚Äôt bring you far in the early stages of dating or finding someone to date at all though, it seems. It even feels more isolating in a way. But well, these feelings are also just an experience - and I can find my peace with it. You and I will likely need a special woman who understands these same things to some degree and who sees the beauty in it.\n\nJust my thoughts on this subject:)\n\n&gt; For me, it‚Äôs hard to see these things play out in front of me, where the guys with the biggest ego‚Äôs get rewarded\n\nI don't think men who have massive egos have great relationships. Ego is corrosive to happiness, respect, empathy, and love. It stops men being honest about who they are. \n\nThere are plenty of 'douchebags' who have the confidence to find casual sex, but they end up in a cycle of cheap, short term relationships where they never commit or admit their failings.\n\nI don't want to be that person. Meditation has helped build up the side of me that wants to embrace honesty and empathy. \n\nIt wasn't particularly my target when I started, but I feel more confident around women now - because I am okay with who I am. The fake 'gotta be a guy' ego is fading.\n\nI do agree! Similar thoughts went through my mind while writing my comment. Yet, it still feels unfair sometimes.\n\nI also have the same experience. With the fading feeling of wanting to prove myself to the world, comes an increased sense of confidence. Not because I see myself as better all of a sudden, but because I know my qualities and do (indeed) not have to be that guy or be liked at all. What helps in this for me, is the fact that I now when feel that when someone may judge me, it‚Äôs actually their own ego trying to find footing and trying to feel superior. The judgement is not ‚Äúout there‚Äù, my judgement comes from within, as does another person‚Äôs judgement. It‚Äôs not reality, so why would I need to worry?\n\nI also subscribe to the idea that a girl/ woman that has worked on herself and who has a deeper understanding, will not fall for a ‚Äúdouchebag‚Äù. Just like I wouldn‚Äôt fall for a simpleminded woman. But that doesn‚Äôt leave many options\n\nI just wanted to reply as a 25f and say thank you for your reflections. As I meditate more and my awareness heightens it‚Äôs been difficult for me to date. I was never the best picker and it was bc I ignored or didn‚Äôt even realize peoples bad behaviors and my destructive patterns. Right now I feel a bit sad but when I think about what I would encounter if I dated it‚Äôs not worth it. I‚Äôve never been more focused on my mind body and spirit so I‚Äôm reminded myself that when my ego is trying to distract me.\n\nHealing yourself is the first step towards peace and finding the special oneüôèüèª you‚Äôre on the right path\n\nThank you my friend. üïâÔ∏è\n\nI want to add to this that some people in this thread, rightfully so, try to say that it is a reflection of your own ego (albeit in their own words). If it hurts you, it means something about this situation was a symbol of a part of your ego. It‚Äôs likely a part of your ego that you have rejected and don‚Äôt allow to come through, or something that has hurt your ego in the past.\n\nIt‚Äôs about confidence, not ego. Ego can help create a sense of confidence but it‚Äôs not necessary nor is it ideal. Instead, pair genuine confidence with focus on your inner world and vibration rather than focus on the people you‚Äôre trying to attract, and you will attract many more people.\n\nI definitely agree! I‚Äôve experienced this too, where confidence from within, and not from the ego, indeed attracts people. But for me it also feels isolating, in that I don‚Äôt meet too many likeminded people in my day to day life, that are on the same trajectory and have the same views on life/ spirituality. I sometimes try to explain my viewpoint on life with the people around me, but it‚Äôs not always understood well. \n\nIt also doesn‚Äôt help that I‚Äôm a little isolated due to health issues.\n\nFind someone who understands your value\n\ni feel u breh. surrendering a primal desire fueled by hormones is certainly easier said than done.\n\nWell good on you. Just so happens that having that type of perspective also makes you a more attractive person overall.\n\nEgo is a double edge sword, it can also give you confidence and help you take more pride in yourself as well as keep you driven, it can also really make you feel horrible and think irrationally¬†\n\nIt's fine to have standards, especially from somebody you would be spending a lot of time with and whose values and lifestyle you will be exposed to.\n\nYes, it's preferences, yes, it's ego, but why is ego something bad in this case?\n\nYou're intellectualizing a basic emotion: you liked somebody, they prefer a lifestyle you're opposed to, and now you feel bitter that the love you projected on another person was not reciprocated.\n\nIt is fine to want to be loved.\n\nWhen love is not returned, this is what happens: it turns into bitterness and frustration and resentment.\n\nWhat can be honey can turn into poison.\n\nIf there's a lesson in your situation, I wouldn't say it's entitlement. You're not \"entitled\" for wanting to share intimacy with somebody that shares your perspective. It's a normal human attitude.\n\nIt's OK to be human.\n\nI would say the lesson is that when you find a negative emotion next time, remember that it's another form of a positive emotion that didn't run its course, so, instead of wanting to stamp out negative emotions, learn to be friends with them and understand them because they expressed something good once.\n\nI‚Äôm really struggling to understand your last paragraph. What do you mean when you say the emotion hasn‚Äôt run its course? Does that imply that the negative emotion will eventually become a positive one? And what would that mean for how we should relate to that?\n\nI got caught wondering why you / OP agreed to being friends when it was against better judgement.\n\nSure, Ego and perceived possession were what fueled anger and bitterness, but this reads like you started dating with intention and settled with a covert contract that she‚Äôd open up to dating again regardless of agreeing to be \"friends\".  Maybe meditating and letting go of these emotions was appropriate, but maybe the emotions are showing the gap between what was wanted vs what was settled for, and maybe settling on being friends isn‚Äôt what you really want and you‚Äôre trying to meditate those feelings away‚Ä¶\n\n&gt;It wasn't until I was mindful and let these high charged emotions and thoughts come and go without attachment\n\nDid you just sit and watched your thoughts?\n\nI like how you removed yourself from that situation. I used to be the kind of person who would get myself into these wierd situationships and then ruin my mental health for months about somebody who never even cared enough about me to reciprocate my feelings. Now I prioritise my own mental well being.\n\nFantastic observation my friend. The ego (or egos since we have so many that want and react differently to impressions) is the root cause of all our difficulties in life. You will find increasingly that as the state of present non-attached mindfulness becomes habitual and longer lasting, without the framing of the ego, all you have is experience. And to the pure awareness there is no better or worse experience, it is all experience, free of judgement.\n\nWithout judgement there is fundamentally no problem. All is impression that passes in front of the light of awareness. Suffering is generated whenever we attach our awareness to these passing impressions and desire them to be or become this or that, but because they are passing and ever changing we can't have what we desire and are attached to.\n\nVery excellent observation, and the lynchpin of all meditation.\n\nWas your friend hurt by these F-boys?\n\nI wonder too what internal maps this challenged within yourself. You may have repressed the f-boy qualities in yourself based on past experiences, what you were told women want etc etc. Seeing F-boys get a girl you considered to be quality challenged this belief leading to friction within yourself which caused you to ask questions like \"Why did she sleep with guys like that? I wouldn't do that. It's not fair. It doesn't make sense. Why them?\"\n\nI trust your experience here and this is just another approach to consider.\n\n[deleted]\n\nSounds like ego and entitlement man\n\nAnd hate\n\n[deleted]\n\nBut it's my ego that didn't want to leave her so I lied to myself and her that we could be just friends. If I had checked my ego I would have told her \"We had fun and have a lot in common but being just friends isn't what I want and I don't want to mislead you into thinking I only want friendship. Wish you the best\"\n\nI should've done that but instead my ego thought and hoped and felt entitled to a chance with her still.\n\nYes. You utilized your ego negatively here. There are positive ways to utilize it though too.\n\nWhen we are rejecting other people, it is usually actually a part of ourselves we are rejecting. We can‚Äôt control the actions of other people. The more we try, the more futile it tends to be.\n\nLove that!\n\nlucky 2 00\n\n[removed]\n\nNah I just wanted to feel loved, to find some fellow gremlin. He can be small, fat, bald. When you have joy, and fullfillness. You can go through hardship. Height doesn't matter, money - well no need for luxury trinkets, but roof above the head is nice. And well good smell, no one wants to sniff something unpleasant. Smell is with you everywhere, you can't remove yourself from it.\n\n[removed]\n\nAnd what research is it? In which country it was done? Can 9000 women talk for every one? Sure my comment was very subjective, I speak for myself, but clearly those 9000 women don't speak for me neither for the rest of them. But maybe it is like this, and more women think like that. But who knows? A national wide quiz doesn't exist.\n\nAfter meditating for five years on a mountaintop, my master said that I could ask him a question. I said, 'Oh, master, tell me the secret of women.' My master looked at me and said, 'Do not ask a fish how to catch a fish; ask the fisherman.' Then, at that very moment, I understood the secret of reality.\n\nNice one, but still it is kinda complicated. You are the fish and fisherman at the same time, you are aware of yourself and themselves. To have what you want, you need to understand what it is and that is simply becoming that thing. Not exactly of course. Humans are aware of each other and who they are and what they want to attract and how to do it. But in reality it doesn't mean that there is only one solution. Experience can be obtained by watching and comparing on both sides and solution given to you maybe don't attract the fish you wish for.\n\nthis just in: hateful dude can't take the heat, forgets to delete all comments\n\nNah, helpful not hateful\n\nBro you should write a book, this is enlightenment-level analysis if women.\n\n[removed]\n\nTheir grammar was correct. Yours is not. [The] book [has] already been written.\n\nTop 3 reasons why men have sex? Being nice, making money, world peace\n\nI think the biggest problem is that u are looking at a category of women that just want to have sex. Obviously there are going to be specific things women look for in who they want to spend a night with. And I think it‚Äôs a little shitty to have such a problem with that because hookup culture in general is a very shallow place. It‚Äôs built on looks and height and all that jazz‚Ä¶because it‚Äôs for a very short time. I think your perception on women is being skewed because u are judging all women for being in the same game as you. If you truly want a relationship with a woman that goes beyond sex u you should stop looking so hard. Yuh know. Pick someone because u got to know them personally and like to be around them and decide u don‚Äôt want to spend time without them. Not just because u are looking for a girlfriend and she is attractive enough to fill the spot. Because if those are your standards then can you blame her for having the same.\n\nThe desire to connect to someone of the opposite sex does come from the ego, but to what extent should we detach ourselves from that desire to make ourselves feel better? I mean yes it does come from the ego and we should remind ourselves we aren't entitled to jack, but it's still a desire that will pop up again if the situation arises, not to mention that our ego works in favour of our survival, which demands certain things being met, some more important than others. \nI don't want to be the devil's advocate, but how should we balance the ego, no ego thing?\n\nOk? Please tell us what would you do with no ego at all?????\n\n[removed]\n\nmindfully: lmao\n\nShit man, we have heroes in the streets begging for change and honorable people killing themselves daily. A whore will be a whore. They don‚Äôt value themselves so don‚Äôt value them. If they don‚Äôt value you, delete da biatch.\n\nHow is she a whore?\n\nTypically, if the issue is people keep leaving after you have sex, you wait‚Ä¶to have sex.\n\nPerhaps you prefer the terminology ‚Äúprimal connoisseur‚Äù.\n\nWomen today are like that. Don't be Friendzoned. Let go\n\nSeems like a very solid reason to get pissed off imo. Glad you cut her off and handled it well though\n\nIt really isn't, she doesn't belong to him in any way, they weren't abything more than friends."

    "all_comment_text": "So I read a book a few months back, and I didn‚Äôt actually care for the book overall, but the one thing that stuck with me was a statement along the lines of ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs especially dangerous to use social media as leisure,‚Äù effectively because it just steals your time with no reward. For me, this really struck home because some part of my social media/screen usage is very tied up in an idea of ‚ÄúI just need/deserve a few minutes to decompress.‚Äù Now, I find that if I‚Äôm just kinda idling on Reddit or scrolling Youtube or seeking out my next TV binge, sometimes that thought will pop into my head, and I‚Äôll go back to thinking, ‚Äúwhat do I really want to do with this time?‚Äù \n\nNow all that said, I‚Äôm definitely wasting time on Reddit right this very moment. I guess I would just say, try to understand the root of what keeps pulling you back, and then identify why you want to change it. If it‚Äôs FOMO, you‚Äôre definitely missing out by watching/scrolling instead of doing, building, making, or connecting. If it‚Äôs anxiety, you‚Äôre not taking action to fix anything, you‚Äôre just clearing your pips. Whatever it is for you, you gotta find that and work with it.\n\nI quit social media but now I am even more addicted to Reddit and YouTube. I do feel much better not comparing myself to my peers but I am still ever so attached to constant stimulation.\n\n[deleted]\n\nI feel this. I once read a post where someone said ‚Äòyou‚Äôre not addicted to your phone or social media, you‚Äôre addicted to distraction‚Äô\n\nAnd I read that distraction is a simptom of overstimulation, not yhe main problem\n\nI‚Äôm so desperate I may need to get a smart dumb phone lol (as I type this on my phone on Reddit üò´)\n\n[deleted]\n\n[deleted]\n\n[deleted]\n\nAwesome! Thanks for the info!\n\nHot take- Wikipedia is a pretty great compromise and I wouldn't feel ashamed about having to resort to it.\n\nPlaces like Facebook are so fake anyway. What my family post about themselves is not even anywhere close to have a really are. On here you can either be fake completely because you just feel like being a fake or you can be the most real out of any place. I guess it's your choice.\n\nIt took me years but I slowly passed my Facebook friends and groups down. Til eventually I only use it for marketplace and parent groups.\n\nThis is my issue too lol now but like you said I think it‚Äôs still better than before and the constant comparisons to everyone around you\n\nOmg me tooo!!! I quit IG/Tiktok and picked up a Reddit addiction. I‚Äôll delete Reddit, redownload it, just like the comment says above, when I want a few mins to ‚Äúdecompress.‚Äù Shit, I even got into fucking scrabble go, wasting HOURS playing scrabble on my phone! It‚Äôs a technology addiction, flat out. I downloaded something called AppBlock I need to actually look into. It‚Äôs just that constant dopamine hit I‚Äôm after, I‚Äôm also a recovering addict. The more I‚Äôm on my phone the more I want it. I know the root problem for me is a constantly want to escape my own mind because it‚Äôs very busy, very loud, and never stops.\n\nThis is really good advice. Seems I have some introspection to do. Thanks for sharing!\n\nthis just might do it for me too, thanks for sharing üòä\n\nwhat book??\n\nThe book was Deep Work by Cal Newport. I found it otherwise rather unconvincing.\n\nI mean, I‚Äôm sitting here scrolling Reddit instead of sitting here realizing emptiness. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\n\nso are all of us, emrylle, so are all of us...\n\nyou can realize how empty you are on reddit ez\n\nüíÄ\n\nI log out of social media apps. Then when I grab the mobile and press I will have to actually log in and that reminds me not to and put it down. \nIt‚Äôs such a powerful ‚Äúhabit‚Äù.\n\nSimple, but freakin genius!!\n\nI do not have an IG account, FB I use it through browser, makes the UI pathetic so do not spend any time, check the notifications for any friend's birthday and call them up.\nNo notifications no fuss.\n\nFor the last 3 months, I've been using my phone more consciously in order to model healthy habits for my pre-teen and teen. Because when things get \"boring\" or \"hard\", browsing on my phone or playing games on it is easy. But then it has become a pattern of escape. So I decided to change... still a work in progress... yet great moments of focus and presence when I manage my phone. \n\nWhat has helped me:\n\n- removing notifications I don't need (no notifications from social media for instance). I consult them on the app directly or on my laptop\n\n- putting my phone away, in another room when I meditate, work (from home)... It's on ring tone so I can hear if someone is trying to reach me\n\n- putting some screen limit on certain apps \n\nSo far, I feel less tempted to browse as a reflex because it's just a reach away.\n\nYup this reminds me of another comment on here, they said that you use it as not just entertainment but as an escape and that‚Äôs where it gets dangerous\n\nTurning it off also helps.  For some reason, that extra little effort and couple minutes of having to turn it on is a stopgap.  Just gives me one little moment of mindfulness and mental space to think about why I want to scroll.\n\nI did a retreat last summer where everyone has the option to turn their phones in for the week. At the end of the week, nobody wanted them back. \n\nWhen we got them back, the day we were leaving, the teacher had us keep being mindful as we picked up the phone, opened it etc. It was really interesting and helpful to watch the reactions in our thoughts and emotions. You might want to try something like this.\n\nYeah its amazing how doing something like that ‚Äújust taking a break‚Äù can really curb usage over time. I equate to dry January and now dry February. The studies indicate that when these breaks are done people are more likely to drink less during the year.\n\nI really should. I‚Äôve been wanting to for so long but always find excuses\n\nread atomic habits by james clear. He does an absolutely amazing job breaking down how habits are formed and how to slowly start getting rid of bad habits and replacing them with good ones. Absolutely loved the book\n\nThanks so much for this! I just put a hold on it at my library. Can‚Äôt wait to read it.\n\nYou‚Äôre welcome! And the book is beautifully written. I could re-read just cause of the way he writes.\n\nExcellent! I‚Äôm SO looking forward to this! üíó\n\nhttps://archive.org/details/atomic-habits/mode/1up\n\nThis is cool. How come it‚Äôs free?\n\nDunno. Someone asked Internet Archive to archive it, so they did. I guess there's a copyright process if needed, but maybe the IA has some documentation about their like \"mission statement\" or whatever. May explain their process.\n\nThanks for the advice. Just ordered it. üòÉ\n\nI leave my phone on the kitchen bench after making coffee and then head into another room to meditate. Out of sight out of mind.\n\nThis works so well but it‚Äôs so hard to consistently get myself to do so üôÉ\n\ni slowly stopped using all social media and have been off it for about 5 years. (i just recently came back to reddit but i plan to cut back again bc i‚Äôm using it more than i want too)\n\nfirst i figured out what was keeping me glued to it - the drama, the info, the inspo, etc. i downloaded a reputable news app so i‚Äôd be in touch with world news but not through social media.\n\nwhat really helped was installing apps that could be opened when you‚Äôre bored, in a doctors waiting room, on the throne, etc. that has one purpose and only really requires a few minutes of use.\n\ncatgotchi is fun, it‚Äôs like a tomogatchi but one the phone. when you open it you feed, play, and take care of your cat.\n\nanother app i use is gin rummy, but you can use any game similar to it like solitaire or canasta. there‚Äôs not a lot of background ‚Äúbling‚Äù and doesn‚Äôt typically pull you in, and the only ask for money is if you want to get rid of ads.\n\ni hope this helps, i know that honestly i feel less congested and mentally healthier with all of the social media baggage :)\n\n[removed]\n\nSame. Had to get rid of the apps to really stop myself. Reddit feels less addictive in the sense that there‚Äôs reading and interaction involved. It‚Äôs not GREAT but easier to extract myself than from Instagram or TikTok. Bitesized videos would send me into depressingly long rabbit holes. \n\nI echo what‚Äôs said above though too with getting to the root of things. It‚Äôs interesting to think about what‚Äôs driving you to these spaces - loneliness, anxiety, restlessness, a need to find something pleasurable. Knowing won‚Äôt solve it but it‚Äôs an essential first step toward addressing the root or even just choosing to experience life instead of distracting from it.\n\nRe: the loneliness aspect of it, unfortunately I think for a lot of people, reddit has become the easiest form of social interaction around shared interests and just life in general. It's anonymous, social pressure-free, easy to get started with, etc. But it's a poor substitute for developing real-life connections with other people. That's only gotten harder in recent years, and social media has only gotten easier. It's rough out here\n\nFeeling the same way. Twitter has become a cesspool after Musk takeover and I deactivated a few times but just couldn‚Äôt. I realized there are communities that are important to me (i.e.; advice on reddit; puppy videos on youtube; film twitter). It‚Äôs just disheartening that we need to spend so much time navigating through all the p0rn bots and stuff in order to truly connect with the people who share the same interests.\n\nI developed a ritual where I put my \"busy\" phone to bed. Then I get out my slow, boring phone, which only has meditations and music. I do this at the same time every day. I also \"schedule\" time on the calendar for social media check-in with an annoying timer üòÇ.   \n  \nThis seems pretty hard at first, but once it becomes a ritual, my mind is like... \"okay let's do this\".    \nIt was similar to when I added cold showers to my routine to improve my HRV. This was a gradual process...\n\nI‚Äôm about to do something like this, I need my phone on me at all times because of my job, so I‚Äôm going to get a ‚Äúwork‚Äù phone that only has my work-related apps on it, that way I can set down and walk away from the fun distractions on my personal phone for most of the day.\n\nI got rid of my smartphone. That was really all i needed to do. I've been without a smartphone for 2 years now so if you have any logistical questions or dumphone recomendations lmk.\n\nI've been thinking about doing this, but I'm a music lover and can't imagine not having access to Spotify all day.  That's the only smartphone advantage I'm attached to. Any suggestions?\n\nI personally was also really attached to spotify when I got rid of my smartphone. My solution has evolved over time. My first solution was downloading albums i like to my flip phone's mp3 player (32 gb of storage and i literally stored nothing else on there. you can fit all the music you want) and playing it though that. When I was out and about, i listened to music from my phone, when i was home I just opened up spotify on my computer and played it through my speaker. Not much different than when i had a smartphone :3 recently, i have developed a taste for older technology, which led me to buy a used CD player online. Now instead of paying for spotify every month, I buy a couple albums on CD, and burn my own playlists. Vinyl is also an option, but much more expensive and less accessible. New CD players are expensive, but old ones are about $50 on ebay and cheaper at your local thrift store. Plus, for the price of a spotify subscription per month you could buy 2 CDs from Half Price Books or 4 from your local thrift store. You can spend the same amount per month on music and after a year you‚Äôll have a formidable CD collection. I still play music sometimes, but i just do it for free on youtube if i really wanna hear a specific song.\n\nKill all but the most vital notifications. \n\nRemove problem apps or set timers. \n\nDon‚Äôt pick your phone up in the first and last hour of the day. Read a physical book, or meditate then. \n\nI read some article that led me to make an accessibility settings change. Now when I click my right iPhone button three times, it changes the color filters to grayscale. Makes my phone boring, dull and lifeless. \n\nThese have all helped with the dopamine triggers. But I‚Äôm still on it 6-7 hours a day!!\n\ngive yourself gentle reminders daily, like going for a 30 minute walk just anywhere\n\nstart incorporating on/off sitting, like every hour, demand yourself to do like 30 push ups, and [some stomach exercise like this](https://youtu.be/2fB1R9uWQbw?t=62)\n\nthe reinforcement is the discipline to try again, even after failure\n\nas for get vorpal pooled scrolling, taking notice, is part of the meditation of practise, taking notice of warping into a realization, breaking free from any entanglement\n\nthis also applies to the exercise of dispelling negativity bias, as you take notice of some negative intrusive thoughts that wanna keep applying themselves\n\nyou pause, reflect, and re take action, \n\nwith the reoccurence of pausing at moment's notice, giving yourself feedback of your current reality, than applying if you feel that you should be doing something more positive in action\n\nI've deleted social media on my phone. This forces me to only access social media on my laptop/browser. It's been great so far - already saved a ton of time.\n\nI can't have my phone on me at work. It's funny because  I can go 40 hours a week with no phone during work hours like the phone is completely irrelevant. But I'm addicted when I'm at home.\n\nI've gone from 5 hours a day average to 2.5. This is what have worked for me:\n\n- Track your time, but don¬¥t get obsessive with it. Try to make it like a game. For example on iOS i recieve a weekly notification saying if my screen time went up or down and in what percentage. You can kick more dopamine adding a price if it goes down.\n\n- No phone in the first 30 minutes (at least) of the day.\n\n- Whenever it¬¥s possible, leave the phone on another room, or as far away as you can.\n\n- Applying B&amp;W filter. This was the biggest game changer for me. At least in IOS it¬¥s very simple to change it change it. So i have it always in B&amp;W and when i want to scroll in instagram or play a game i change it back to color.\n\nUninstall any games, and go somewhere in nature for a week without Internet (if you can). It helps a lot to go a week without any connection to anything, then come back to see that you and the human world are perfectly OK without you having to be constantly connected to it.\n\nüí•The problem is not the screen it is the information, apps, that causes a dopamine effect. \n\nüåÄSolution, \nOnly allow information that you can be of service to. Anything else delete. \n\nüß¨Remember, you are the master of your time, your emotions, your thought, yet the underlying sources to guide them all is being in your state of awareness. In the State you can observe undesired (non serving) emotions, thoughts, actions arise. When it does arise break the habit, put a cold flannel on your forehead, put on soothing music, go for a walk, cycle yet nothing physically extreme...üåÄ Choose being in the presence of Life. \n\n‚ú®Why am I on Reddit, because of these conversations üåÄüôè‚ú®üòé\n\nGet a digital detox app. It allows you to program an amount of time during which your phone is blocked.\n\nYou can‚Äôt use it for anything except looking at what time it is, call an emergency number or receiving calls.\n\nSome of them allows you to choose what app you wanna block and when (E.g.: you choose to block reddit after 10 consecutive minutes on the app per day. After 10 min, the app will shutdown and you won‚Äôt be able to use it until the next day).\n\nI have my phone set up to shut off certain apps after a certain amount of time of being in use. Also I set it up to turn to grey scale after a certain time at night.\n\nOther things I do is put it on the charger in a different room than the one I'm working in. If it's not near me, I tend to focus in whatever I'm supposed to be doing instead\n\nYess the charger trick is great, I should start doing that again\n\nThe grayscale trick is actually a thing!! Our eyes love seeing the colors that our phones provide, it's literally addicting to look at! My friend brought up turning her phone fully on greyscale as a method to lesson her usage and it does in fact work a bit!\n\nTreat your phone like a gameboy or computer. Something you use and then put down or away. \n\nBuy an analog alarm clock- leave your phone in the other room.\nSee how sad you look/are addicted to a phone(sorry I wouldn‚Äôt say that to you but that‚Äôs what I say to myself- so embarrassing to have a high screen time amount- you cant enjoy real life you have to disassociate?) \nWanna google something? Walk to your phone pick it up use it and put it down and walk away. \n\nHave something you have to do when you have an urge to use it like 10 pushups.\n\nHave a mental timer- ok putting the phone down in 5 4 3 2 1 (Mel Robbins) \n\nSincerely, \nSomeone who‚Äôs working on the same thing\n\nThese are great! I‚Äôve wanted an analog alarm for so long but I wake from the lightest sound so it‚Äôs a difficult pick\n\nI created a crap ton of automations in the ‚Äúshortcuts‚Äù app. Now everytime I click an app it redirects me to way more boring apps.¬†\n\nHahaha sorry that‚Äôs very funny to me. I like your style\n\nThe clear space app helps with that. But my real problem is I always find another distraction. Went from facebook and instagram to TikTok to Reddit to obsessively checking my email to YouTube videos to tv‚Ä¶ any time I cut something out I find a different way to waste time. The one thing I‚Äôve found is that I never feel bad ‚Äúwasting‚Äù my time on books, so I try to use all of my previous phone time for books. I usually have 2 physical books going and 2 or 3 audio books so I have something for different moods and don‚Äôt get bored\n\ni started by turning off all notifications and deleting my social media apps. from there, i picked up more hobbies and substitutes for times i want to sit on my phone. now i don‚Äôt really feel the urge to go onto my phone unless i‚Äôm absolutely drained and want to rot for an hour\n\nExactly this. I deleted every single social media app and game on my phone. I recently downloaded Reddit again because I‚Äôve discovered some new hobbies I want to learn about, and I‚Äôm trying to connect a little more. But I said aside time in the day to be on here for 10-15 minutes.\n\nSounds like the problem would be solved by removing reddit from your phone.\n\nNot really, I had no social media for a long time and it was the same. It‚Äôs just the idea that I might be getting messages or needing it for any other function while studying\n\nPosting on a social media platform to brag about quitting social media, baller move, Ball‚Ä¶.Er.\n\nWhat part of this reads like bragging to you?\n\nI paid for an app called AppBlock to help me, because I am painfully dependent. I don‚Äôt have the wherewithal to break the habit myself. I mainly use it limit my myself to a certain amount of time for certain apps. It‚Äôs only been a week but I‚Äôm really enjoying it so far.\n\nI‚Äôm hoping it helps me reset my brain and break the dependence on the constant stream of information it craves so I can practice more mindfulness and be more present.\n\nI think I might need to get this too. Thanks for the suggestion and review.\n\nI‚Äôll likely try this out, thanks!\n\nWhen I started hiking, fishing and skateboarding my screen time went from 9 hours a day to 4\n\nUsing a watch is helpful for me! Instead of looking at my phone for the time and getting lost in it, I look at my watch.\n\nI make a point to turn my phone off at least once a day and meditate during that time, in addition to any other meditations I do during the day.\n\nThe first thing I did was start keeping my phone on silent all the time. I have the ringer on for calls, but texts and all other notifications are silent. I only see them when I intentionally go into my messages or a specific app. This way I stopped being a slave to the \"ding\". I also deleted most social media apps from my phone, and would even turn my phone off completely when I could. At this point, I asked myself - why don't I just get a flip phone üòÇ I didn't, cause I use Spotify a lot, but I'm still thinking about it.\n\nAll this was a gradual progression, and combined with meditation, I started to become very aware of when I was using my phone from an intentional space, or when I was using it to escape. I also noticed I felt terrible when I got sucked into the screen for hours, and started replacing it with other habits, like walking, yoga, writing, or connecting with people. Feeling good was a huge incentive to keep this up.\n\nAll of these things compounded and now I genuinely enjoy life more with minimal screen time, and it's pretty effortless at this point.\n\nI do allow myself to go into \"zombie mode\" for a bit on the weekend, because it's relaxing in moderation. But now I can feel when I'm naturally \"done\" with it, and will close the laptop or turn off the phone. I intermittently download social media on my phone, but will delete the apps if I feel it's becoming a problem until I've broken the habit again, and then I'll redownload them for intentional use.\n\nOn Android there's a built in App called Digital Wellness...you can set it for timers on apps, so I put 35 minutes on Facebook, 15 minutes for Tik Tok, more for Reddit...idk you set the time, point is it helps to limit so my brain doesn't turn to pointless chaotic overstimulation. There's also a \"Focus\" mode if you have a deadline for work, assignment, time with your kids etc to shut off all apps except your phone or email (again super customizable and built in). I find it's best to acknowledge I still want to read articles or look at cute animals as a way to decompress,  but stay too long and I'm on an obsessive rabbit hole on celebrities that literally don't do anything but chaos for my poor brain. Just gets you hooked. Good luck!\n\nDelete every mindless app, especially social media‚Ä¶\n\nIf you have a computer this works even better, you can still keep updated with your friends and family or work stuff but it‚Äôs not on your phone so you are more likely to go onto those apps with determination rather than something to pass the time. \n\nI have ADHD and this worked for me. I still waste a bunch of time üòÖ but I find it easier for me to pull away from my phone and screens\n\nSet screen time limits and actually abide by them, you start to notice how much you would normally pick up your phone and scroll without even thinking about it\n\nYou can turn your screen into black and white mode!\n\nAt a minimum I'd suggest turning off notifications for anything you don't actually need.\n\nAt a more extreme level you could try turning off your phone when you're not actively using it.   If you need to go through the process of turning it on in order to use an app, you're less likely to do that mindlessly.\n\nIf you need a phone on at all for something like work purposes, get a new phone for it and keep ONLY the work related apps on it.\n\nI took all social media (FB, tiktok, SC, IG) off my phone except Reddit which i seriously curtailed my use . I read a lot. I watch a few YouTube videos but they are mostly history or this Buddhist monk I like. That said, I'm 61 and lived for decades before social media so it wasn't that hard. After a couple weeks I realize how toxic much of it is and how it monetizes misery .\n\nWhat‚Äôs the monk‚Äôs channel?:) and yeah when I realized the extent of evil behind social media it was easy to delete everything (besides reddit)\n\nIt's called Buddhism (Association of Noble Friends). The tagline it @BuddhisminsimpleEnglish. \nThe monk that hosts it is really good. A young articulate man who seems very down to earth\n\nAwesome, thanks!\n\n‚ÄòFast‚Äô from your electronic devices one day a week and you‚Äôll find less desire to use in general.\n\nTbh..only real active social media I use is discord and reddit..yt is for videos to watch(mostly outdoor stuff) I was just born this way..never cared about soical media..and I don't think I ever will..only reason why I have social media is to make new friends, keep up with people ik personally or news\n\nI performed technology fasting. I also manage my time better and am able to meditate more regularly. Compile those with handsome book hauls from the library, and I feel less and less interest to engage in anything other than Reddit.\n\nI enjoy using the O Launcher for my android. Also, having designated time of use. Most texts can be answered in your own time. When you want to pick up your phone, pick up a book or set a timer.\n\nUse a dumbphone!\n\nCheck out ScreenZen app\n\nRemove all fun stuff and anything which involves scrolling. Remove all social media apps, disable YouTube, disable the news app. I also have all notifications disabled on my phone and have it permanently in silent mode.   \n  \nThis way, I can use my phone as useful tool (notes app and calendar mainly), without it being something I'm addicted to. If anything, I now have the opposite problem. I often forget to check my phone. Sometimes I forget to even turn it on.   \n  \nThe only fun app I have on my phone is Spotify, but I don't feel addicted to that. I just use it to occasionally listen to podcasts when I'm out for a walk.\n\nnice text!\n\nNot as easy as we all know, but I set reminder using the care clinic app to be reminded of the things that I need to do¬†\n\nWell I'm on Reddit so who's to say I did?\n\nBy being an adult and getting a hold of your self and just doing it. By not looking for short cuts or the easy way out. It takes discipline, it takes persistence, but coming from experience, it doesn‚Äôt take long.. you have to love yourself enough to actually want to change and not look back.\n\nDeleted socials and my screen time plummeted 80% in one week. I also started using Reddit more eeeek. I set a timer for myself, but it‚Äôs hard to hold yourself accountable! I also started challenging myself to no phone and hour before bed, and no phone and hour after I wake up. I will spend some time here on Reddit in between. I still have the urge to pick up my phone and scroll. Screens are hard!\n\n[removed]\n\nWe do not allow links only.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Meditation) if you have any questions or concerns.*\n\nRestrict social media time to poop breaks only!\n\nDeleted my Facebook account, not sure if this was the wisest decision but yeah, my phone usage went down significantly. Also while I still use LinkedIn obviously Reddit, I don't have the apps on my phone. Personally I feel I still use it a lot but I've been told recently how little I use my phone\n\nIve tried app called Opal, it has really helped me to lower my screen time when I have to study\n\nI deleted all of the apps i get stuck on for a week and a half, if i felt they were important still i re-downloaded them but kept them off of my home screen so i have to search for them to get on them, a little more thought process of ‚Äúdo i need this?‚Äù before opening it.\n\nGet a screen time widget on your home screen that way every time you open your phone you can see how much time you've already spent on it\n\nI deleted Instagram and Facebook. Other than Reddit, I don‚Äôt really have a reason to be on my phone these days.\n\nI wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs solved the issue for me, but getting involved in physical projects (building, art, etc), team sports, learning an instrument, board games etc. have all proven to leave me disinterested in what my screens have to offer\n\nPlus one on this! It's my problem too. \n\nAs a PR specialist, that little device is practically glued to my hand for work. But I totally get wanting to dial down the usage during my rest day. It's a struggle to find that balance, right?\n\n2 years ago I turned off all notifications for all social media apps because I found my phone to be too much of a distraction in studying for my boards. That was the best thing I did for myself. I still have the notifications turned off and I have freedom. I check social media maybe once a week or once every 2 weeks.\n\nI keep my phone away from me when I need to be on task. Preferably in a different room. I also do more activities where it's difficult to not be present like hiking or nature walks and sports like sand volleyball.\n\nMy sot was ~7hrs on my android and ~4hrs just by getting iPhone caz I don‚Äôt like to pay for shit when I can get it for free haha\n\nProbably asking the wrong people here ‚Ä¶\n\nI'm trying to remember wtf I used to do to fill my time before smartphones.\n\nI got rid of my home WiFi and went with a no/ low-data phone plan. \n\nI was able to make so many positive changes in my life since going without Internet. Lost weight, got a new job with a significant pay raise. \n\nI was doing great but then my mom, who I live with, got home Internet again so it's so easy to connect and stay on it. \n\nI'm moving out soon and at my new place I will NOT have Internet. It takes too much from me. I'd rather be living life.\n\nRight before I pick up the phone I ask myself, what intentions do I have? Is there none, I put it down.\n\ndeleted everything and started to listen to podcasts and audiobooks\n\nI turned my screen grayscale. Helps a lot\n\nTime management system that I have developed works for me.\n\nIt‚Äôs not meditation but rather sitting down each morning and planning what I want to do that day.  It doesn‚Äôt leave a lot of time for being on devices, except for certain times of the day or when I‚Äôm falling back into my ‚Äúprocrastination‚Äù habit that comes around once in a while.\n\nBut I have time scheduled for just about everything I need to do each day.  I also stopped using apps for my task list and started writing in a notebook/planner.  The Full Focus Planner is the one I use because it is simple and provides a place to write your tasks, appointments/meetings, and take notes(which I do a lot of considering how many meetings I have a day).\n\nHaving a system that works for you that allows you to manage your time can help reduce being attached to the screen.\n\nNot sure it was Meditation that lead me to do these things, so I would say it is my drive to always be learning and improving things.\n\nSet time limits, prioritize offline activities, create routine.\n\nTry to change your phone mob on black white,¬†\n\nHere‚Äôs what I would suggest, I sort of found this out unwillingly in a sense. I am retired from a career in IT, the last 20 years have been particularly horrible. Horrible in the sense that management, expectations from a single individual, and constant overloading people with projects beyond their scope, caused me to hate my job even considering the nice paycheck.\n\nI had to write that paragraph to set up my response. For decades, I was attached to some type of electronic device 24x7x365. So, when smart phones came out it was just a easier, quicker way for management to reach me at any time.\n\nI‚Äôve been retired for about two years, it took me months to set my phone down, turn it off, multiple urges to pick it up and do things. Equate that urge and need as exactly the same as a heroin addiction, nicotine addiction, codependency of horrible type. Stop telling yourself the phone enhances your life. Put the phone down, turn it off, repeatedly tell yourself that you don‚Äôt need it and it‚Äôs not enhancing your life. go to friends, people, events, and leave the phone behind.\n\nI‚Äôm kind of radical in this way I do it, so I don‚Äôt expect most people to read this and say, ‚Äúyes, do this!‚Äú. I‚Äôm just telling you since I‚Äôve been able to do that and make it a habit, my life is so so much better.\n\nIts people following people. Imitating people\n¬†You get what we have,¬† a bunch of losers!\n\n\n\n\nFollow god"

    "all_comment_text": "&gt; how do you love the present moment when you know the devastation is waiting for you?\n\nHow? I do this by *knowing* there is nothing *but* this moment.\n\nMy thoughts and feelings occasionally take me away from this moment, and then, when able, I *remind* myself that wherever they have taken me *is not.*\n\nThinking about things that *are not* can be useful, just as thoughts can be useful, and worrying about such things can be a useful signal to prioritize action, but worries *are not.*\n\nWhenever I feel stuck or trapped, I practice returning my attention to *that which is.*\n\nLook. Everywhere you see is Nothing, but for the Now. That person you care about in front of you, they are part of Now. The worry you think is only Now in the moment you think it, and then it vanishes immediately, unable to be held‚Ä¶ unless you think it again, and again, and again, constantly recreating the thought, so your brain can hold it with the tips of each firing neuron needed for the purpose.\n\nExhausting‚Ä¶ isn‚Äôt it?\n\nI love the present moment because every other option is harder. Love is *literally* the path of least resistance.\n\nI needed this tonight, thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nNeed is always best. Good luck!\n\nI try to live this way but I worry that honing this skill may end up making me feel worse if someone I love dies. Because I'll have got good at focusing on now and living in the moment but if they're never going to be part of the present moment again it's like you lose everything about them and it almost feels disrespectful like you're moving on too quick. I have this same issue when people I love have had terminal illnesses, I know I'm worrying about the fact they have limited time left to an unhealthy extent but if I put them out of my mind and focus on the present moment when I'm not in their company it feels disrespectful and like I'm wasting their last moments. Maybe the way to combat this is to live in the present but to allow happy memories to live with you. And carry an awareness that the present moment and you yourself may have been shaped by your loved ones. If anyone has any other ideas I'd be interested to hear them.\n\nEven the most beautiful songs come to an end. Does that make them less? Can their sweet notes not be relished in the echo of memory?\n\nedit: I missed the gist on the second half; apologies for that. Here‚Äôs an addendum:\n\nTruth is, the present moment is slathered with hooks and barbs. The key lies in practicing how we identify signal from noise.\n\nRegarding loved ones, thoughts of them are nearly always signal unless, as you say, it is excessive. In my experience, thoughts like that are in fact unheard feelings, and need action. Find a creative means to share yourself with them.\n\nIf you cannot be without them in your thoughts, simply go to them and give them your time. They probably need help, and I know you have love to give. ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nI sounds like you have a giant heart and you care deeply for the people in your life. \nThat being said, guilt is an evil weight to carry, especially when you‚Äôve done nothing wrong. \nIt feels like you have some rigid beliefs and expectations around being healthy and alive while others are not as well-off. You hold yourself to high standards. Think of it this way‚Ä¶if you had a terminal illness, would you want all your friends and loved ones to be miserable and unhappy all the time bc you‚Äôre sick? Probably not. Speaking personally, that would break my heart. \nTry giving yourself the same grace that a loved one would.\n\nI have come to realise that guilt is a very counter productive and in a way a self-serving pass i give to myself. It has all the allure of ‚Äúdoing something‚Äù about an issue with zero action actually being done. When we feel guilty, we feel or fool ourselves that we are doing something because we are expending energy/suffering. But this false thinking/approach can take us away from any possible actionable items which will make a difference. Example: feeling guilty that one has not called one‚Äôs loved ones and had long chats. This is useless. Instead even sending a text saying ‚Äúi am thinking of you but do not have much to talk now‚Äù will go so much in the direction of strengthening such bonds!\n\nGreat post\n\nThanks. I hope it helps.\n\nEverything is temporary - the good, enjoy what you got while you have it, the bad, doesn‚Äôt last. I take great comfort in both. Death is coming for us all, with any luck it‚Äôll be another great adventure, into the mystery we go :)\n\nLove this! Reminding myself that emotions are temporary has helped me through some dark times\n\nOMG I posted the same thing then saw your comment haha you know what‚Äôs good!\n\nThis really is great advice\n\nMy favorite advice related to this topic is \"do you get sad when you get a piece of chocolate cake because you know it'll end?\" Of course not. You eat the cake and you enjoy it while it lasts.\n\n^ This guy makes peace\n\nIn Buddhism there's a practice known as the 4 reminders. One deliberately reflects on precious human birth, death and impermanence, karma and samsara. That is, how lucky we are that we can meditate, how that could change at any moment, and how pursuing worldly goals just goes in a loop of suffering.\n\nIn normal life, egoic mind is constantly trying to secure ground and maintain the illusion that both world and self are solid. With that view, seeking worldly pleasures and goals makes sense. But it's not actually realistic. The truth is that we might die at any moment, nothing endures, and no self can be found to exist. \n\nThat was the gist of the Buddha's first teaching: We're constantly struggling with pervasive anxiety, trying not to see the truth. We hide from it by setting goals and creating purpose. Most people don't even know they're miserable. We just focus on hope and fear. \"I'll be happy once I get that.\" \"I'll be happy once I get rid of this.\"\n\nIf you practice meditation and actually watch your own mind, you're likely to become increasingly aware of this dilemma. Then you face a choice: Cultivate going beyond illusion, or stop meditating. If you choose the former then the dark cloud is useful. You don't need to fix it. Heed the reminder to let go of clinging and come back to nowness.\n\nResting in the present moment doesn't mean \"loving\" it and feeling happy. It doesn't mean getting more out of life by focusing on immediate experience. That's like climbing a mountain with wine and a lover to watch the sunset. It's a clinging, greedy approach that doesn't work. You end up sitting there trying to figure out how to capture the experience. Then you get a mosquito bite. The air is a bit too chilly. Or maybe a bit too warm... Nowness is interfering with your attempt to capture nowness. :)\n\nSo I think it's more about just dropping fixation and cultivating a willingness to relate fully to one's own experience. Surrendering to nowness rather than possessing it. At least that's my experience from Buddhist meditation.\n\nI'm curious what Buddhist insights are there for someone who goes thru a soul shattering experience, not a temporary bad season but one that changes your very identity to the core and leaves you scrambling for a new direction in life. One that leaves you with little foundation of who you once were and not only grieving yourself (identity) but your loved ones that passed on at the same time. I'd love some  insights/reading for something on that level.\n\nIsn't that a reminder of impermanence? You won't find comforting aphorisms in Buddhist teachings. It's about coming to terms with reality. Whether you find that helpful and relevant is up to you.\n\nAnd what is suggested for one to come to terms with a new reality?\n\nNot new reality. Just reality. The official first teaching of the Buddha is the4 noble truths. Basically he says life is full of suffering and the main cause is our attachment to a belief in an existing self. Such a self can never be found. Experience is always changing, phenomena are impermanent, and life can't be grasped. Yet we keep trying. We're always deeply shocked when our life changes dramatically because we imagined that we could depend on it.\n\nThe 3rd and 4th noble truths explain that there's a solution, and that's the Buddhist path to enlightenment.\n\nThat was great thank you!\n\nThe way I look at it, it is just flow, the parts that make us up change through life, the thoughts that flow through our heads.¬†\nWe are, truly, made from stardust.\n\n\nA lot of people close to me have died, and for me one of the hardest things was that the specific light they brought to the world was gone, I'd never hear their joys again, when I'd see something I know they'd love I can't pick the phone up and call them.\nI wanted to stand on top of the world and just scream¬†\n\"SEE THIS, SEE HOW PRECIOUS IT IS, _SOMEONE_ MORE NEEDS TO KNOW WHAT DANDELIONS MEAN!!!\".¬†¬†\nUntil I realised _someone_ still does, I do.¬†\n\n\nThey left me with all that love and laughter and insight, for me to carry on their light in the world.¬†\nMy heart is a quilt of all those, living and dead, I ever loved.¬†\nAnd when I die, hopefully some pices of me lives on in other hearts, and the best of me continues on.¬†\n\n\n\n\n¬†And the rest is just stardust.\n\n\nEdit: formatting\n\nthat's really beautiful\n\nWhat's the alternative? Everyone lives forever? That sounds like a fate worse than death, I wouldn't wish that on anyone.\n\nYou do live forever, but start of each reincarnation you lose memory of past life.\n\nUnless you decide you want to stay up there.\n\nLiving forever wouldn't be a curse, there are infinite dimensions to the human experience, with true engagement you'd never be bored. I know why this thought pattern is helpful for so many, but it's not the temporary nature of life that makes it special, it's life itself that is special. And in the face of such an aspect of death, we treasure what life we are given, and that includes not letting the fear of death cloud it. \n\nJust as life's importance is not defined by its temporary nature, nor does the temporary nature detract from it.  You are the universe looking back at itself, maybe a freak occurrence of biochemistry, or a metaphysical condition our species was elevated to, and we know of no other examples. We stand tall in the face of death, doing what we can to delay its calling for itself and others. And the best way, is joy, it's to appreciate every moment, it's to breathe. Every breathe. Until your last. And celebrate and revel in the happiness we are capable of, and recognise and overcome as best as possible the darkness and pain we face.\n\nJust as Camus imagined Sysphus happy in his recognition of his condition being cursed to roll that boulder up and down endlessly, we must dare to imagine ourselves happy being cognizant of what may truly never grasp, our own mortality. \n\nI Hope you have a good day.\n\nEnergy can't be created or destroyed, have peace in knowing that.\n\nüíØ\n\nJust accept the crap out of it. Whenever that feeling comes up, practice total acceptance. \n\nIt's the acceptance of everything as temporary and the non-attachment that entails that reduces suffering\n\n‚ÄúYou see this goblet?‚Äù asks Achaan Chaa, the Thai meditation master. ‚ÄúFor me this glass is already broken. I enjoy it; I drink out of it. It holds my water admirably, sometimes even reflecting the sun in beautiful patterns. If I should tap it, it has a lovely ring to it. But when I put this glass on the shelf and the wind knocks it over or my elbow brushes it off the table and it falls to the ground and shatters, I say, ‚ÄòOf course.‚Äô When I understand that the glass is already broken, every moment with it is precious.‚Äù\n\nThis gets quoted on this sub every once in a while. Some people don't like it, but I find it helpful sometimes.\n\nThe same way I enjoy a slice of cake or a good movie. It‚Äôs about the experience.\n\nMmm cake\n\nI think for me personally, the fact that nothing lasts for ever brings me a sense of peace. It‚Äôs how you look at this thought\n\nI hate changes.... I hate the fact that everything that is giving me a sense of security and comfort will go away soon but that fact makes me enjoy every ounce of what is given my the moment or else it will Witter away without even giving a warning üòä\n\nEvery seven-ten years your body goes through another complete cell cycle change. You aren't the \"you\" from ten years ago, not even physically. You aren't even the you from yesterday. Through meditation I've come to learn that to be patient is to be present. There in the moment, all the time. It's not easy, a lot of things demand your attention these days. We're overstimulated in my opinion. \n\nSomething clicked for me recently. About time, about life. Consciousness. I do not have the ability to remember anything outside of my own experience. This life. Some people believe in past lives. I don't think it matters unless you can make use of the memories - the information. Having said that, we're all going to die. I don't know when my time is, it could be later today for all I know. I think in this life the most important thing you can do is to work on being present. Work on being patient. To be patient is to be present. Observe your breath, your emotions, the world around you and how people tick. \n\nSomeday you will not be in the present moment. Our windows are little snap shots here. In and out, in and out. We have the ability, and the choice to think differently. It's not easy, it's like mental exercise. To sit alone with yourself in silence is like untying a knot inside of your mind. If you can slow down and appreciate the smallest moments, things might fall into place. The fear of death will melt away because you can simply enjoy now for what it is. To be patient is to be present. The future doesn't much matter if it's always now. Enjoy your friends and family everyday, don't worry about tomorrow.\n\nIt's out of your control, so what do you want to achieve by worrying about it? Let go.\n\nThis is the way\n\nbeing sad, anxious won't help, won't change things. to observe what happening and how your mind react may help.\n\nit‚Äôs not about what you lose. you need to reframe your relationship with the universe. you are given the gift of consciousness, and every day is an extension of that gift.\n\nit‚Äôs not what you lose. it‚Äôs that you get to have it, even for this fleeting moment.\n\nThe flip side - nothing painful, sad, sorrowful lasts forever either ü§ó\n\nYou don‚Äôt know the ‚Äúdevastation‚Äù that awaits you cause we, as humans, can‚Äôt predict the future. There‚Äôs so many endless possibilities as to what your future holds. \n\nI would recommend exploring some cognitive restructuring, something I‚Äôve learned in CBT. Something like ‚Äúmy parents are getting old and will die one day, andddd I have them now and can enjoy this time w them‚Äù\n\nEven the great pyramids will be reduced to dust someday. \n\nThis has been on my mind lately as well. It makes me question what really holds 'value' in my life if everything inevitably returns to the earth. \n\nMaterial possessions don't feel as valuable when I see things this way. Either do my problems, insecurities, fears, grudges etc.\n\nIn that frame of mind things like Virtue and love seem invaluable. I think things like these can leave impressions on people; which can then be passed on and have the potential to last forever. \n\nThis helped ease my mind of the existential side of it, and focusing more on what truly matters in the present. Just my 2-cents.\n\nEverything is temporary, it‚Äôs soothing to know the bad times will not last, but cathartic to know everything you love won‚Äôt either, so appreciate it in the moment. It‚Äôs beautiful, the concept of changes\n\nSuch a sad question yet it's profoundly real.  I think we all have a sense of fearful wonderment when it comes to our own end of life.  Each moment we give it attention it doesn't deserve, we're taking away joy and gratitude from within ourselves.  We're all human beings and fear, doubt and anxiety seeps in and finds a way to rob us of comfort, peace, understanding, and hope.  We're all very emotional beings and affected by challenges, trauma, and all kinds of experiences in our lives, and even if 100 of us experience an identical event, we will all react and respond very differently and we all have different coping methods. Be kind to yourself and while I understand these thoughts will come as if your brain finds comfort and has a place there, I think you would benefit greatly by turning your attention to being grateful for the good things you have instead.  Force your brain out of that place by deliberately turning your attention to the people, places and things that bring you happiness and joy and a sense of calm, peace and love. Life is a roller coaster ride, lots of ups and downs as it is, so make plans for living your best life instead of focusing on fearful or dark moments on something you can't control. Allow yourself to freely feel all of your emotions but don't allow yourself to dwell in negative areas otherwise your hope will diminish and it's not fair for you to live that way.  You deserve to enjoy daily life simply because you are Blessed with life on this day.  What can you control? Talk about your thoughts and feelings with people who really love you because they would want to help you.  And if strangers here on reddit are willing to reach out to you, imagine how much more comforting it would be to have people in your life truly help you and give you a hug, or show up to drag you out of your head.  Give them an opportunity to show you that they care and love you enough to listen and be there for you when you feel darkness.  Follow uplifting podcasts that inspire you to create the habits that will help you empower yourself. (I follow Jim Kwik and read a daily scripture). You can call your sibling(s) and friends and do something enjoyable, create memories, read, travel, bike ride, take photos, go-see-do. Live.  Eat good food that satisfies your soul, nourishes your body, and indulge in flavor you've have yet to experience. These are all things that allow you to focus your time, energy and feelings on the present moment.  Not every day will be filled with sunshine but there is always something to be grateful for.  Maybe get a notebook or a journal and at the beginning and/or end of day jot down those things you want to remember or be thankful for.  Within a few weeks you should already see changes in your outlook.  Once you're seeing these changes, the habits will be much easier to continue.  You asked how others cope and love the moments knowing one day things will be over.  Well.....Prayer helps me through, and quality times with my husband.  We make our own sunshine when we need to. I also really love a good nature walk all by myself so I will get to a nearby nature preserve or park. With a camera in hand I go actively searching for beautiful signs of life. Wildlife, birds, rustling leaves, streams, even flowers, plants and insects, mushrooms, and moss covered logs will get my attention.  I instantly feel better, and alive and it's peaceful.  Nature is rewarding me with an abundance of life all around me.  I always feel better when I can find peace.  Sometimes people around me can have a negative attitude or influence so I get away from them as soon as I can.  That's when I just want to spend time alone, but other times I want to spend with a friend or loved one.  I'm the one person I can't ever get away from so I think it's important to spend time on my own well being and self care.  I think we all should.  I can figure out my thoughts and feelings and I'm free to express them any way I wish without other people having an opinion, or needing my action/reaction justified to their own understanding or beliefs.  And I can tell myself, it's ok to feel this way because I have values, thoughts and feelings I'm passionate about.  Did I over-react?  What could I do better next time? Can I change something about this experience? What will make me stronger?  How can I be living my best life &amp; what does that even look like?  I can focus on the things that can make it happen and become who I want to be.  I just have to be willing to do what it takes and spend some time getting there.  Everything I think, do or don't do will affect my future, and the future version of myself.  Anyway...I felt compelled to probably overshare, lol.  But I hope with all my heart that you can have some sun shining over you instead of that dark cloud.\n\nI loved reading this. It was really helpful. Thank you üíï\n\nThank you so much.  Many hugs for you ü§ó¬†\n\nI don't know how to tell you to make peace with it. I can tell you how I made peace with it. The realization that death is a natural and necessary part of life. When we lose loved ones, loved things and situations, you as the person left living will continue to feel the pain of that loss. The pain itself is part of life. It teaches us of love, it teaches us of acceptance and of living in the here and now. \n\nThis question is most likely the reason that early humans developed religion. It made it easier to believe that we and our loved ones were going onto a better place when we left here. I don't know what the hereafter is. But it's obviously the next step or nothing would move on.\n\nFind a faith if you need it. Feel your emotions and try to find their purpose. And realize that you and everybody you are losing are moving on, just like they did when they came into this reality.\n\n&gt;- \"The moment you know your real Being, you are afraid of nothing. Death gives freedom and power. To be free in the world, you must die to the world.\" - Nisargadatta Maharaj, I Am That\n\nYou make peace with them simply for the same reason, because they don‚Äôt last. The people around you won‚Äôt be here forever, so enjoy their presence today. This moment won‚Äôt last forever, so enjoy it today. Enjoy the present, because it‚Äôs temporary.\n\nYou enjoy the ride as an observer experiencing this reality for a short time.\n\nThe existential dread doesn‚Äôt last either :) I know it‚Äôs hard, but that helps me when I feel overwhelmed\n\nWhen you realize that it‚Äôs a good thing, you‚Äôll find peace and even wait for things to end; including your own existence.\n\nWould u rather live forever?\n\nEverything will end. Enjoy it while you have it. If you spend all of your time worrying you won‚Äôt ever get to enjoy it.\n\nAmor Fati. Wabi Sabi. \n\nAccept that it will end, but live while you're here! Enjoy it buddy, because it will end.\n\nHang out with your friends, do that crazy thing, transform dreams into memories, laugh, cry, smile, frown. Do it all.\n\nYOU'RE ALIVE!\n\nSounds like you need to work on your relationship to Death in general. It's not a negative thing, it's a necessary part of life. There's deep beauty in it. Without Death, there is no Life.\n\nThe only way out is in and through. \n\nYou aren't suffering because you're scared of impermanance. You're suffering because you're *resisting* imperanance. Resistance is what causes the suffering. \n\nAnother way of saying it (the more-traditional Buddhist way) is that you're *clinging.* You're clining to a hope of permanance, and clining is a form of resistance. We cling to the side of a mountain to resist falling. \n\nNone of this is a criticism of you. We all resist that which scares us. It's natural. Which is why it takes practice to overcome.\n\nParadoxically, what you need to do is stop resisting and *fully feel* the fear. No easy feat, I know, and not a pleasant prospect. But you have two choices in life. You can either put up endless resistance, so that you'll continue to suffer and suffer and suffer and suffer. Or you can let the fear run free in your system, \"say what it's been needing to say without resistance,\" and be done. \n\nIt's like letting the air out of a balloon. You can let it out slowly (maybe for decades of your life), or you can let it out all at once. (Psychedelics often knock down resistance and let things out all at once, whereas meditation is a slower and generally safer method of doing the same thing.)\n\nYou've probably seen hundreds of movies about someone resisting grief after a loved one dies. Distracting themselves, getting drunk, fucking up relationships, etc. Then, there's some climactic scene where they go fully into the grief, the dam bursts, and they sob their hearts out--fully out. And then they have some peace. \n\nVarious forms of meditation are training for this. Which is why, when you meditate, you learn to sit with your feelings--as a companion to them--without judgement. That doesn't mean you don't feel them. It means you don't *identify* with them. You don't identify *as* them. They're something you have, not something you are.\n\nIt's very hard to leap right to doing this with big scary feelings--maybe impossible right now, if resistance is too strong--which is why it's good to spend weeks, months, and years practicing with smaller things. \n\nThey can be really small. You walk by a dumptser and smell something putrid. Rather than resisting it, what's it like to just let yourself feel that disgust? What's it like to not try to change it or stop it--but to simply feel it, fully? Your friend makes that same lame joke you've heard him tell a thousand times? What's it like to sit with that frustration--to let it take over your body--without trying to change it or stop it? To let it be what it needs to be? \n\nYou don't have to formally meditate to do this. I do little checkins like this dozens of times a day. A lawn blower outside is irritating me? I sit with the irritation (without trying to change it or stop it) and observe it in my body. \n\nHINT: your body is more important than your thoughts in this work. Always get curious about how whatever you're feeling is manifesting in your body. You know it's in your body if you can't exactly put it in words. \"When my boss rolls his eyes with me, and I sit with it, I think, 'Shut the fuck up, jerk!'\" Of course, if that comes up, observe it. Observe whatever comes up. But that's cognitive. That's a thought. That's words. What can you sit with that's in your body?\n\nFrom this platform of sitting with small irritants, you can slowly build up to sitting with more and more challenging feelings. What won't work is avoidance, wishing things away, distracting yourself, suppressing, and so on. These are short-term \"solutions\" that just prolong suffering. \n\nSome folks have gotten help from Internal Family Systems therapy, which (in my opinion) is really just another way of doing the above, with some useful anthropomorphism thrown in. It sees \"resistance\" as the work of Protectors, which are internal sub-personalities that are trying to stop you from going directly to pain (causing suffering in the process). In IFS, you *don't* go directly to the pain. You work with the Protectors, first, being an ally to them, until you earn their trust.\n\nSimilarly, in the work I describe above, when you meet resistance, don't try to stop it. Rather, sit with the resistance, without trying to change it or stop it. Sometimes there's even resistance to resistance. Same deal. \n\nReal life example: I get anxious stomach aches (though way less often now then before I started doing this work.) They are resisting \"what's underneith,\" which, with me, is usually fear of abandonment. \n\nThen there's resistance to the resistance: \"Dammit, stomach! STOP HURTING!\" That's what I sit with first. I don't try to say, \"Let the stomach hurt if it needs to.\" That's for later. Right now, I just sit with that outer layer or resistance, not trying to change it, letting it do what it needs to do, getting curious how it feels in my body. (If you don't know what is outer and what is inner, just sit with whatever is there in that moment.)\n\nRemember way up top, when I wrote about the only way out is in and through? And letting all the air out of balloon at once? When I *am* able to quiet that outer layer or resistance--when it's fully had its say and is done--and I go to the stomach pain and let it be what it needs to be, without trying to change it, it tends to hurt more than ever. It no longer has resistance to fight it back. Sometimes it takes over the rest of my body. \n\nBut then it's done: A stomach ache that would have previously been less intence but which would have lasted for four hours is now over in 15 minutes.\n\nI‚Äôm quite old and probably much closer to my own exit than you are to yours. I‚Äôve been thinking about death on and off almost daily for more than 20 years now. ¬†Here‚Äôs my sad answer: you don‚Äôt ever really make peace with it. It‚Äôs terrible, and it‚Äôs appropriate to be sad about it.¬†\n\nBut when you face the sadness squarely and allow yourself to feel it fully, face on, for some reason you also open a door to feeling the beauty and wonder of the world more intensely. It‚Äôs a smiling-through-tears thing. Knowing everything is impermanent, watching things fall away, can give you a weird kind of joy/sorrow unlike any other emotion I‚Äôve experienced. Its a transcendent appreciation of what‚Äôs here now I guess.\n\nI‚Äôm saying all this as if it‚Äôs universal, and I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs just my experience.¬†\n\nI very wise man once told me that an eternal life could never be fulfilling. It would be stagnant. Impermanance makes life precious.\n\nNothing lasts forever, including suffering. That‚Äôs the great news!\n\nI'm at the same point, very scary\n\nActually if you think about it the fact that nothing lasts is great, it's the reason the world exists, continues to exist. If there was no death the world would probably have like double the population meaning lots more suffering because we would have exhausted earth's resources. There would be one set of very rich people stretching all the way since the begining of humanity so if you were unlucky to be born poor too bad for you. There would be no progress, no upward mobility, no new ideas, inventions. \n\nThe world needs death just as much as the world needs birth. Death is the equivalent of the recycle bin, it creates space for birth, for new ideas, for change, for evolution to happen. Life would not exist without death just as death can't exist without life. Everything that has a begining must have an end and that's a great thing. It means pain must end, horror must end, suffering must end. It also means all the good things must end but would they really be good things if they didn't end? Like the rich man who takes his wealth for granted until he loses it and realizes how fortunate he really was. Or that guy who grows up in poverty and works hard to change his fortune. Without the change forced by nothing lasting forever the world would cease to exist. So nothing lasting forever is actually great, it forces you to appreciate what you have, your friends, family, your health, your work. All the things that you have that make your life worth living, appreciate them while you still have them\n\nThat truth will take its course on being uneasy with nothing lasting. Eventually that uneasiness will not last and burn out too ahhahha\n\nNothing lasts. The same goes for bad things too.\n\nI feel this heavy!  But sure how to move forward I feel so stuck, so numb...  so empty.\n\nLook at it like this, nothing lasts, everything, everyone is temporary. We‚Äôre all going to die one day. Make the best of what time you have.\n\nI‚Äôve struggled with this since I was a little girl. I have no advice.\n\nIf everything lasted, we would be dodging dinosaurs and big nasty bugs today. Living a good life is all we can do!\n\nThe notion that nothing lasts is exactly what brings me a sense of peace.\n\nThey only peace that u need to make is with yourself cause in the end you don't bring anything &amp; you don't take anything with yourself so you can't make peace with anything except you, know yourself...\n\nI use that dark cloud to serve a strong reminder that every single present moment matters because we don‚Äôt if it‚Äôs going to be our last. It‚Äôs the best motivation there is to be a good human and to not waste our lives.\n\nHmm. It‚Äôs a good question as I resonate with the anxiety about this. For me it was a matter of acknowledging my options: live in anxiety about the inevitable or accept that which I cannot control. There is just so much in life we cannot control and when you realize that all we have is the present moment it just seems like an absolute waste of time to spend precious time worrying about it. In fact it actually seems crazy even to live in anxiety and fear about things that will happen anyway, we are here for limited time and ideally it is time full of as much joy as possible. \n\nMeditating on Death has really helped with my acceptance, since afterall that‚Äôs really the crux of what is so scary about the unknown, in fact I‚Äôm doubtful anyone can find true peace until they come to terms with Death. I realize this is a meditation subreddit not spirituality, but another thing that has helped in particular is learning about Near Death Experiences. There are countless accounts about what happens when we die that are eerily similar, and at this point I have 100% Faith that there is more to this life, that on the other side there is pure love, oneness, peace.. that our souls will live many lives;  I used to really live in fear of the apocalypse but accepting that I‚Äôm an infinite Being and that things may arguably be predetermined has made it a lot easier to just surrender to the wild ride of life.\n\nMy favorite mantra for when I get existential dread like this is ‚Äúthere is nothing more human than dying‚Äù\n\nNothing ends.\n\nThis is my opinion only based on own my life/death experiences, prayer, and input from Spirits and Guides.\n\nEverything is made to disintegrate. Come apart. Disappear. But energy does not dissipate. I think Einstein said that. And maybe some other wonderful scientists. Everything continues even after disintegrates. It becomes something else. That is the physical. That is the way it is meant to be.\n\nSo do we. We disintegrate. But the real part of us, the true part of us, the Spirit that we really are, never dissipates. Not even a little. I believe we come here to experience the physical reality of living on this planet. There are lots of other experiences we could choose. Other dimensions other planets, other existences. It is our choice. And we all chose this one. \n\nMy time will end before too much longer. Frankly, I am looking forward to the next life. I‚Äôve learned so much here, so much love, so much hate, so much grief, so much happiness. Time for a new one. It‚Äôs been fun!\n\nI had a really bad existential crisis at 18 I couldn't stop thinking about death my death everyones death we all die how can people wake up everyday and live life normally how aren't more people focused on this I was thinking about that all day how can people not care and be so hedonistic I couldn't sleep from panic attacks thinking I'm dying everything I closed my eyes but I got over it and to be honest I don't know how maybe it was a chemical imbalance thing but by 19 and 20 I didn't care as much I don't know what exactly happened but I accepted it you just live and enjoy life and do good you don't have to worry about death because its not a part of life if you know what I mean it's a part of the next life so live this one\n\nMy wife has trouble with this as well. This whole plane of existence is here for you to experience everything it has to offer. Good, bad, happy, scary and sad. Temporary or not it's all here for us to experience. Soak it in and treat it all as a blessing because it is temporary and we actually get the opportunity to experience it all.\n\nIf you are into reading or audibles - check this book out  ‚ÄúThe Art of Living: Peace and Freedom in the Here and Now by Thich Nhat Hanh. \n\nI loved the perspective I got from it about death. üíñ good luck on your journey!\n\nRead irvin yaloms books, staring at the sun is one I think\n\nThat is an emotion in you that is rising to the surface to be discovered and explored when u r up to it. It is your attachments and fear of loss.  we all experience it in some form. \nEnergy is never lost, but rather transformed.\n\nHow can you not? When nothing lasts, you have nothing else to do but be at peace\n\nYou're talking about love, healthy and unhealthy attachment, longing, desire, and connection - all very human stuff, full of who we are, full of our inheritance, evolution, full of the whole catastrophe of being alive.  \n\nYou just love it without anything leftover.  The pain and the sorrow are still touched by something vast and unknown, like a misshapen flower or an off note.  No need to leave anything out, or to assume that you won't be enough when pain and sorrow get to you.  In Zen there's a koan:\n\nThe priest Songyuan asked: \"Why can't the clear eyed Bodhisattva sever the red thread ?\"   Or, Why can't a fully enlightened person not escape the wheel of karma?\n\nThe red thread is the thread of desire, or the river of tears.\n\nThere's nothing you can do about that sorry Hun¬† change is just ......so¬† just remember to find loving thoughtful moments with those who deserve your time and who you cherish only right¬† now in the present don't dread on the past don't assume your future because you'll always grow and change. Just be sure to spend the right now with everyone you care for. Always remember focus on today the beautiful right now if you feel this way again start making a grateful list in your head that moment it'll cheer you up immensely.\n\nlet it consume you, feel it completely and the cloud will transform\n\n... all things are impermanent.. even your thoughts, feelings and fear. This is what is contained in these dark clouds.. yet even the harshest of storms are temporary and burn away in the brilliance of a clear sunlit sky. This sun lit sky IS your mind, absent of these darkening thoughts. \nThis is why we let go.. we appreciate, but we do not cling, we love, but free ourselves from any dependence.. liberation and clarity can come no other way. ...When you meditate and you breathe in, quietly take notice of the endless spaciousness that fills your body through your in breath.. allow the pleasure of this sensation to clear out your body and mind, focus on this freeing sensation with every breath, you will find no other thoughts there, this is the natural state of your mind.. Quietly relaxed, calm and enduring without limit.\n\nI think it‚Äôs okay to feel sad about those things too. Because you love those people. But I try not to dwell on it and come back to the present moment. And maybe take a walk or do something fun. I guess I mean feel your feels, maybe journal about it, but then try to come back to now or you‚Äôre just wasting your precious time.\n\nI have had the exact same worries as I get older. The things that have helped me are a form of spirituality that believes in the quantum field and the belief that there is no beginning or end; only transformation. Transformation of energies we can perceive in our human form and those we cannot. \n\nWhat we see as ending is really only energies tranforming into a different state. I personally believe that we came from this energy, and as our friends and family pass, they return to this energy. Each of us will take this journey.\n\nWithout a beginning or end we live in the present. \n\nI know it is not for everyone, but it works in my mind.\n\nI‚Äôve always been somewhat comfortable with the thought of me dying but it‚Äôs the thoughts of others whom I love dying that hurt. And I have had loved ones die. I think it‚Äôs something you just learn to accept. It hurts, cry when you have to. I recommend watching the midnight gospel specifically the last episode it‚Äôs about his mom dying and coming to terms with it. Practice meditation. Be here now with your loved ones and savor the moments knowing they‚Äôre not going to last forever.\n\nyou answered your own question proving you had the wisdom to begin with.  Likely in your present moment, there is nothing wrong. The reality is that you are correct but only seeing half the picture. In that time also exists elation, surprises, good fortune, new relationships in the balance. You've always known it's all temporary.  Get with it...and enjoy this passage of time in the present. Good luck amigo-\n\nPlease. Enjoy this Journey, with these people, a moment at a time. \nAllow only joy energy so your physical body may experience all it can. \n\nThat low vibration energy will ruin your health.\n\nDeath is the cost of life. Knowing that today might be my last to see my wife and kids makes me look at everyday differently. I think because we know that life is going to end we should love harder, help more, and always be positive. The shit we can't control don't matter if we don't wake up tomorrow. \n\nThe struggle is real. I hope you can find peace, always here to chat.\n\nI grew up with these anxieties as a child, I have a big family so I went to a lot of funerals as a kid and understand death was the only certainty before whatever comes next, and still sometimes find myself having them as an adult. I understand and allow myself to recognize the truth behind my anxieties however I bring myself back usually by reminding myself for me personally worrying about the future and of the inevitable will only continue to let me focus on those anxieties until something passes. Something I do I find helpful is as a child all the way through adult hood, I keep things like little notes my mom has left me, or I take photos randomly when I like to of others, as while this is a token for them to have it‚Äôs also a token for myself. My mom sends me stuff on instagram and I keep it as a saved folder for what my mom has sent to me - obviously some are just a hunch of cute videos but the truly meaningful ones I make sure to save. I recognize all life on this earth is physically limited, however if we fear our mortality and those we love too much we may loose the good moments. It‚Äôs understandable for this to make some feel as when loss happens it may hurt them more than if they focus on the good without thinking of the end of the timeline. However too much worrying will cause consistent strain and grief and may make it hard to enjoy those moments once they come near their end. Life is unpredictable and anyone‚Äôs timeline could get cut short faster than you wished, so I find I settle my anxieties with the smaller things. I always give my family a hug, I always say I love you to them before I leave or they leave for their day or appointments or anything. I‚Äôm not perfect and some days if my mom had gotten into an accident I‚Äôd regret not giving her a longer hug at the door or sitting with her more. But what I can do is look at that and choose how I want to act in the present and future up until that moment because I have no control over life‚Äôs journey, but I have control over my choices and actions. Something as I choose to not move until my grandparents pass as I don‚Äôt see a reason or need to move, many have asked why I haven‚Äôt done school abroad or moved with a friend, however for me I moved to an apartment with my ex, and lost the last 3 years with my family pet I grew up with, to the point when I moved back I had a few months left with him but I could tell I hurt him. I still regret that a lot to this day but I can‚Äôt take back what life skills and growth moving out gave me too. When he passed I had sat with him the night before, and he looked content and happy to see me say my last words to him. I still cry thinking about it but I know he passed happily knowing he had family that loved him. Any guilt over past choices I‚Äôve made for those I love who are still here I see it as I can‚Äôt change the past but if I still feel guilty then I have something I know I must change for the present and future. It‚Äôs still hard to consciously make those choices and it feels like life goes by so fast. But I find solace in channeling those feelings into things I can do to remember the brilliant memories with the loved ones still here today. Days still fly by faster than I ever could think, but I find happiness in knowing I do my best whenever I can and strive to when I haven‚Äôt to make the most with my loved ones before their time has passed. I hope this helps ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nDevastation isnt the way most of us leave here, and i hope you don't leave that way. I'm 77 and I know my days are dwindling. I'm grateful for the life I've had, and more greatful for each additional day. Gratitude is the key to a happy life, though good health is also necessary. Count your blessings and things might not look so bleek. And help another older person see these things and I bet it will help change your outlook, it can't hurt.\n\nI mean, isn't this the whole point of meditation? Certainly the fact that everything is subject to death and decay is what set the Buddha off on his journey. His message was that true peace is possible. Meditation and mindfulness being key components of the path. \nI would imagine many mystical traditions are motivated in some way by the same quest. \nI'm not sure there are that many people who are truly at peace... But perhaps more than you realise have had glimpses of something 'deathless'. And this itself is encouraging to me. Useful to seek some of these people out.\nPersonally I'm working on making peace. Considering death highlights what I'm clinging to - it's pretty humbling to see how unwilling the mind is to let go.\nI find reflecting on the quality of 'dispassion' helpful. The possibility of becoming less infatuated with the body, feelings, thoughts, perceptions, and consciousness. Just the possibility of letting go brings some peace. Also, reflecting on human goodness, and committing to not deliberately harming living things I find helpful.\nFinally, in meditation, bringing up a sense of peace, and reflecting that the sense peace itself doesn't necessarily depend on things not changing.\nI still struggle of course, and I'm sure there are many other approaches. E.g Eckhart Tolle (or some Zen masters) may really emphasise how mistaken identity is at the root of the lack of peace, and that once you see clearly that you aren't any of the things you typically identify with (body, mind, thoughts, emotions, consciousness itself), then peace can arise. But to actually see that seems a bit like dying anyway !\nI wish you every success in finding peace !\n\nSometimes I call planet Earth \"Disappointment Island\". That's because nothing lasts. No matter who you are, it's going to suck to grow old, and die. The only people who are ok with death, are the ones who believe they are going to live forever in heaven. Total bullshit, but billions believe this, because it makes life bearable. How else to process the death of a baby, or the genocide of a million people? I desperately wish there was a heaven, and a loving God. There is nothing after death. Life goes on, without us. And in 1,000 years, no one will remember you at all, not even relatives, and even if they did remember your name, they really knew nothing about you personally. 1,000 years from now, you will seem as uncivilized to future people, as cavemen seem to us.\n\nBy finding something that does last forever, the truth sets us free. Connecting with that truth within helps.  But there‚Äôs a way and technique\n\nYou relish the one life and moments you di get with them then just cast with dark dread.¬†\n\nWhat's the alternative? If everything you loved was preserved forever nothing would ever change. Isn't that the same thing as death?\n\nChange lasts.\n\nSmile because it happened. Everything is flowing.\n\nIf I were to possess immortality, would any of the current events hold significance in the grand scheme of existence?\nIn this hypothetical situation, even the experience of pain should be embraced and valued. There is no need to fear solitude or loneliness, as sometimes the tranquility of silence can provide the answers to all our inquiries.\n\nCertain things do last forever in the human spirit and experience. Hope, love, connection, shared memories also last a very long time. ¬†A lot of things last a long, long, long time as George Harrison sang.\n\nMake peace with it? I embrace it, for this too shall pass.\n\nI'm ready for what's next, for example, and look forward to the day this world and it's petty concerns are no longer relevant to me.\n\nBy letting go on the belief that things should last. Easier said than done, it takes practice, and the peace that come with it is a product of that practice which you can buy, not with money but with pain and suffering.  \nHow do I practice it personally? By inner talk, just like someone would give you advice when you're in pain of a loss, I give that advice to myself using inner monologues and dialogues. Meditation can help because it teaches you how to detach from thoughts, but since I'm new to it, this is where my personal experience stops being relevant.\n\nDoes resisting the fact that nothing is permanent make things last forever? Does suffering caused by such resistance have any purpose or utility? Then what part of your mind is resisting, and why?\n\nIf everything was good and lasted forever it wouldn't mean much if anything at all. Without suffering and the temporary nature of things good times would not appear valuable. There is no positive without a negative.\n\nEnjoy the present moment. Everything that you have rn just enjoy it. You‚Äôre worrying about the future.\n\nYou don't entertain those thoughts. \nAlso, really looking deeply into the fact of impermanence. Nothing in this universe lasts. Every single moment is in a state of flux. Every perception is here and gone. Everything comes and goes. \nDon't look at death as an 'ending' it is simply a part of life and it is happening at every moment.\n\nYou are afraid of missing out on the presence of your loved ones when they die but they exist in your memories and more deeply, their presence is also your own, you can never lose them. You lose them when you start entering into thoughts that take you away from your inherent peace of mind. X\n\nThat my feelings about stuff not lasting won't lasting either.\n\nWhen you find Self and realize the only thing that last.\n\nDont think about it.\n\nthe reason anything feels good, the basis of happiness, is due to the fact nothing lasts.\n\nPersonally, I find it very soothing that nothing lasts \n\nand all things change.\n\nWhat would your ground-of-being be?\n\n....not to mention that there would be a LOT of disappointed surfers.\n\nFWIW.\n\nSometimes there is peace, sometimes there is discontent. Even the peace doesn't last. So it goes.\n\nThere‚Äôs a book on my counter right now that may help you. A friend sent it to me years ago and I‚Äôm revisiting it now \n\n‚ÄúStaring at the Sun‚Äù by Irvin D. Yalom. \n\nThe author is a psychiatrist and the entire book is about overcoming death anxiety and the many ways it presents itself. It‚Äôs quite beautiful, while remaining intellectual and informative\n\nYou‚Äôre so close. Why do you think you‚Äôre feeling sad about this? It‚Äôs because you love those people. \n\nThat sadness is just another form of love.\n\nYou don‚Äôt have to focus on making peace with that fact. Instead, use the vulnerability of those conditions as a way to deepen your love for everything and everyone around you. It IS sad. But that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs also so beautiful. You get to experience these moments. And that is amazing.\n\nYou need to do some mindfulness meditation. There is a best free app called balance which gives you 1 free membership and has many mindfulness Exercise.\n\nI wish I had a helpful reply, but sadly I‚Äôve lost nearly everyone close to me and I‚Äôm standing alone and devastated wondering what to do now üòî\n\nBut identifying yourself with something that is eternal\n\nI just don‚Äôt think about it that much\n\nI think immortality would actually be scarier somehow.¬† Knowing that you would live forever.¬† Knowing that any accident or disease could take you out.\n\nI embrace the notion that it‚Äôs all a mystery. Everything is temporary, that‚Äôs true, but we really don‚Äôt understand all that much about the nature of reality. Consciousness is a mystery. What we call death is a mystery. Love is a beautiful mystery. Approach it with openness and curiosity.\n\nTo accept the reality of this life means you have matured. Your inability to accept the inevitable is a reflection of your immaturity\n\nIt's a fact that I can't change. It has actually helped me cherish 'now' more. Enjoy it when it's there, because one day it won't.\n\nThis also helps me to remember that discomfort is also temporary.\n\nWould you really want things to stay the same permanently?\n\nI think this is when you make a choice. It's good that you are noticing you are living in anxiety, and you can then say because nothing is permanent, I am going to make the most of it.\n\nI was hospitalized once from TBI, and when you die, it feels like you slept forever. That is literally it. You have to decide how to live your life because every moment is fleeting.\n\nDon‚Äôt beat yourself down! You only live once and it‚Äôs forever :)\n\nIf the things you regard as ‚Äúgood‚Äù will not last, then neither will the ‚Äúbad‚Äù.  In the grand scheme of time.  Our existence on this planet, including this planet itself is a blink of an eye.  Our minds are designed to stretch this flash of existence like a rubber band extending from this fleeting present moment into the past and the future.  In reality, it is all unfolding right now, hence it is both here and not here.  It is lasting and fleeting.  We exist and we don‚Äôt simultaneously.  Live in this moment. ‚úåüèª\n\nThis is assuming the end of life is devastating, but no one knows.  A huge help for me has been to stop assuming things. If you don‚Äôt know, ask someone who does. If nobody knows, don‚Äôt just assume the worst.\n\nLet me do the devil's advocate for you. Now you live forever. Now you can definitely postpone on letting your feelings to your loved ones since the will not die anyway. Now you can put off all the important things since time-wise you have plenty. It doesn't even matter why you're worried because you will live forever, or better, maybe you can burden yourself with all the worries because you have plenty of time now. \n\nThings are beautiful and we appreciate them better because we know they will not last forever. That is also the point why you enjoy a movie... It may end sad or happy, but either way you know it did end and the intentions have been made.\n\nDo your honourable best until you can. Identity is just a practical tool of the mind.\n\nThe mind itself holds much deeper truths than the survival of this body.\n\nBy practicing Buddhism. It talks about impermanence, non-self and suffering among other things. Check out the five remembrances :\n\n\n1. I am of the nature to grow old. There is no way to escape growing old.\n\n2. I am of the nature to have ill health. There is no way to escape having ill health.\n\n3. I am of the nature to die. There is no way to escape death.\n\n4. All that is dear to me and everyone I love are of the nature to change. There is no way to escape being separated from them.\n\n5. My actions are my only true belongings. I cannot escape the consequences of my actions. My actions are the ground upon which I stand.\n\nI nearly died of a heart attack at 44, and that gave me some serious perspective. We're all here now with choices. You can let life weigh you down until the end, or you can make the best of it and try live fully‚Äîeven though the outcome is the same. I chose the latter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(I don't want to make it sound easy. You don't just 'choose' but I'm making the effort.  That doesn't mean that I never share your view. I have my bad days )\n\nFocus on the present moment when those thoughts appear.\nr/mindfulness.\n\nI've been given an opportunity to spend this time with the people I love, the alternative was me staying in the vast nothingness and never meeting them.\n\nI like to think about it this way, everything that makes up me will become something else until the heat death of the universe, which is pretty far off, but also consider there may be many universes young and old, besides this one. I have no doubt in my mind, I will meet them again, in some capacity.\n\nI also think your feelings come from familiarity, and in the next life, there will be others for which you will likely say the same thing, that's kinda beautiful too, because it says something about the universality of love in this place.\n\nmaybe in the next life you'll be my brother or sister, and I would rather welcome that experience than to run away and dread, what is an eventual cycle. We just shed our skin, to look at the new world with new eyes.\n\n\nIt's the Experience \nI learned it the hard way, by going THROUGH it.\n\nLife will hit you, and it will hit you hard, it will hit you high and low.\n\nYour choice is between longing and suffering and acceptance of reality.\n\nLet go of unnecessary attachments\n\nIt‚Äôs even worse there is no ‚Äúlasting‚Äù because there is no past OR future there is only ‚Äúnow‚Äù the same moment all at the same time everywhere, and it‚Äôs over as soon as it happens.\n\nI just try to enjoy and spend as much time I can with my loved ones, and when they moment happens, I can look back on the memories that we stored.\n\nHi internet friend! Exactly that way, because it all is going to end and go away it's why it's so valuable. Think about people who live near a fantastic tourist spot, most people don't visit local tourist spots if they live there, cos it's \"always\" there, so they don't appreciate it as much. If I think of everything as a sort of magical thing, event, feeling, person that won't be \"always\" available, I will appreciate it so much more, bask in its fleeting glory.\n\n  \nStuff we like? doesn't last forever, so better enjoy, stuff we dislike? it doesn't last, so no need to suffer due to it.\n\nWhen those sorts of thoughts arise, I let them go and refocus my attention back to the present.  Just like in meditation. It's no different than having anxiety about other types of bad things that might happen. Most mental pain comes from thinking too much about the future or past.\n\nWould be pretty meaningless if everything lasted forever\n\nimpermanence is beautiful\n\nYou have no control over that. That is how being occurs. There is no use worrying about the fact. You were not here before you were born and everything was fine. Everything will be fine when you are gone. There is no use worrying about any of it. It will persist until it stops. And when it stops, something else will start. That is the way.\n\nI think what happens is that life forces you into acceptance, if you are open to the transformation.\n\nI had the same thoughts, was plagued by them. Got a tattoo of a symbol that helped me when I imagined it and worked it over in my mind, even!\n\nThen a good friend passed (expectedly) and the deeper understanding came along, to go with the knowledge that ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna kick the bucket too‚Äù.\n\nStill takes a conscious moment to come back when those thoughts do come up. Very compelling content for the upstairs genius department üôÑ\n\nYMMV. Contemplation and mindfulness may be sufficient.\n\nEdit: also a focus gratitude for the given moment is a bit of a counter to the sentiment that leads to existential fret.\n\nGreat question OP. Thought-provoking and has inspired some interesting responses here. Thank u\n\nThe answer is to see that the components that comprise your sense of self are just as temporary as everything else you perceive. That‚Äôs the practice.\n\nBy experiencing the one that does last forever.\n\nThis makes me treasure the moments even more.\n\nAlbert Einstein once said the only thing that‚Äôs constant is change. So that means everything is always changing you can‚Äôt look at the same river twice. Adapting is part of life if you can‚Äôt change then you start to fall behind in life. Because it‚Äôs when you cling and don‚Äôt at least go with the flow you start to go backwards and fall further behind. As the movie Shawshank Redemption‚Äôs  main character Andy once said ‚ÄúGet busy living or get busy dying.‚Äù Changing adapting or at least going with the flow is living. Holding onto the past or expecting things to stay the same is dying. Do you want to live for today or start dying for an illusion? The choice is yours‚Ä¶\n\nI totally feel you here. üôèüèª When I start to go down this rabbit hole of thought, I remind myself that if good things were constant, bad things would be, too. Everything is in a fluid state, most of the time striving toward balance. Dark, light, hot, cold. Even though good things end, I‚Äôm grateful for the experience. When bad things end, I‚Äôm grateful for the lesson sometimes and for their end. ü§£\n\nOne of the tenets of Buddhisms Four Noble Truth is that all things are transitory  Nothing last.  This leads to the suffering of the kind that you are experiencing.\n\nBeing Mindful roots us to the present moment.  Worry about tomorrow leads to anxiety.\n\nyou seem obsessed with retaining people, things, places, and time as possessions.\n\nwhat you should be doing is allowing the joy of making a difference -- and choosing freedom, love and happiness every single day -- to light the way. you should be living so freely that you don't feel the need to emotionally hoard things as they are.\n\nThe feeling of impending doom looming is the worst. It makes it so hard to stay present. I would call it high functioning anxiety. I try to just accept that nothing is forever and while it doesn‚Äôt take away the anxiety all together, it does help to try and just enjoy things while they last.\n\nFew here seem to bring up that perhaps the soul of the loved one that has died lives on. That the body is shed ,but the soul, that the physical body was a small projection of, continues to exist in its God-like magnificence,  or it IS God. You are God.\n  Perhaps the experience we have on Earth is for a reason, that our souls Chose to have an earth experience, to, in a sense, make God greater. \n  Buddhism doesn't focus on this, or from what I have seen, even talk about it. It is a hindrance in their view\n\n  I am struggling with the issue the OP brought up. My wife died 7 months ago. I am struggling with the loss. Memories of her always. Perhaps her soul is there, feeding love into me from her current state? There are many accounts of past lives and what the between-lives state is like. Can't all be imagining.\n  Buddhism seems like perhaps it was good for a while, in certain cultures.It doesn't have answers for me in this present day, except, the idea of \" being in the present\" is helpful. And it is true that all we have is NOW. And the clarity of the senses meditation can bring.\n  I do believe individuality survives. Perhaps merges into a bigger, more God-like soul. Perhaps that's the journey.\n\nMost of the comments in this thread are advocating for some sort of thought-based intellectual activity like ‚Äújust accept it‚Äù or similar. While well-intentioned (and not entirely untrue), what the comments don‚Äôt address is that the fear you are experiencing is itself a thought-based intellectual activity.\n\nNever try to argue with the brain over its activities. The brain will always win, leaving you right where you began.\n\nOTOH, one-pointedness-of-mind meditation will quiet the inner dialogue that is causing you such distress. It‚Äôs not a quick fix, but practiced properly, it‚Äôs guaranteed to work. Develop a daily practice and once your basic skills and routine are settled you can almost watch the incessant chatter become quieter day by day.\n\nBest of luck to you. Namaste.\n\nTime is an illusion (according to phycisists) this means the past and the future does not exist, our mind hallucinates time. If time does not exist, do we ever die? Do we remain always alive at some point in time and space? Science cannot explain what consciousness is yet, this thing that is looking out of your eyes. Near death experiences are fascinating, people close to me have experienced things regarding people that passed that cannot be explained, if you ask around, your close friends and relatives will surely have a lot of anecdotes. \n\nIn regards to impermanence, and dealing with death. We cant stop death, so why fight it? Same as a lot of painful experiences that come our way, this is like trying to stop a river's current, it is exhausting, and futile, changing will come whether we want it or not. It is robbing you of you serenity and joy in this present moment, what comes after in some ways is irrelevant because we have no control over it. To me, it is a choice between worrying yourself sick for no benefit trying to change something you cant, or enjoy the time you have left in this world. We all die anyway. \n\nI cured my fear of death with magic mushrooms, I left this world, and went to a place full of love that felt very familiar, like ive been there before, there was a sense of the eternal, I cannot put it in words, after that I stopped worrying about death. Theres been medical research with cancer patients, and it greatly helps them with their existential drear, and helps them come to terms with their mortality. It used to torment me every day before I got into bed. The thought of total annihilation, and nothingness terrified me greatly. But not anymore, I wish you can liberate yourself from this fear.\n\nWell I suppose if every good thing lasted instead, we eventually would be unable to enjoy it anymore. If you just imagined how depressing that would be, to never be able to enjoy anything ever again, idk it makes me feel a little comforted, that there is a purpose for the finite nature of life. This isn't really meditation advice, but I also like to look into the night sky, at the stars, the many that have existed way before us, and will exist long after us. Helps me to not feel alone in my struggles somehow, not sure if that makes much sense.\n\nThe fact it‚Äôs temporary means it‚Äôs better to enjoy it. It‚Äôs the only way. And if it was permanent, we probably couldn‚Äôt enjoy it as much. I think what you‚Äôre expressing is a fear of your own death.\n\nThere is much more to life than what we know, see, feel. Humanity has a purpose related to creation. In certain writings, it is called \"the kingdom of God,\" and it is eternal. I take that to mean \"outside of space and time;\" another dimension. If this interests you, see Tim Mackey's work for a much better explanation.  cheers.   :]\n\nI think the spiritual goal is more seeing reality clearly so you don‚Äôt resist reality, and there‚Äôs a layer of contentment that is resilient to the ups and downs. Less clinging. What‚Äôs going to happen is what‚Äôs going to happen.\n\nThere is no you to make peace with it. Nothing is already lasting, or unlasting. \n\nAs soon as the illusion of being a separate self that is in relation to others falls away, there is just this. what is happening. \n\nthere is nothing any person can do to change the seeming reality of things, nor does any thing need to be changed. It simply is just what it is\n\nThe truth is that the fact that things are temporary means that things will fade away and that amazing things _will appear_.  Everything good we know comes from nothing ... and eventually returns to nothing.\n\nYour joy was born from chaos and will return to it.  The miracle is in the moment.\n\nI'm having a really hard time with this too\n\nNothing lasts but nothing is lost. Precisely because all that exists proceeds from a divine Nothingness. All is an illusion - mere shadows on the wall of consciousness\n\nI understand how you're feeling. I had the same anxiety/negative thoughts about my parents. I still get them at times and I feel the emotions you're describing.\n\nWhat kind of helped me out is. If you choose to create your own family, you will surely have some family and friends in the future. But the most important thing is that, I'm getting into dark territory, that there is death in order. I don't have a child yet, but I'm sure every parent would prefer to not see their child die. If nature takes its course in order, that will be more painless for the people you love most.\n\nOther than that, I just accepted that this is life. I did not lose anyone very close to me yet luckily, and I know that I will have devastating days at some point. I could go on with negative thoughts here, but I'm just going to stop myself. Because there is no point of suffering in your mind when in reality nothing has occurred yet. **Stoicism helped me in this sense**, I would not recommend taking all of the Stoic philosophy into your life, but some parts do help with this problem we have both faced.\n\nOther than that, becoming more independent, in the emotional sense, and being able to really enjoy your time in solitude could help. I know that I'm fine when I'm alone and usually spend time wisely and enjoy my life. In these moments, I feel less of a need to control life and nature, and just accept that no matter what, I should focus on having a good time. Which goes for times with friends, family or alone. The best thing you can ever do is focus on enjoying your life, understanding what things give you joy, and just doing them. Again going dark mode: Me, you, everyone on this post is going to die someday, hopefully, it will be in the right order and after a fulfilling life. It's not just our loved ones that will pass. We do live as if we are going to be living forever, and it is sad when you start noticing people you love get older. It's a part of life. No need to take it too seriously, nor try to understand it. We just need to live it.\n\nAlso, if I were to ask you. Would you prefer to be the age you were 10 years ago, or 15 years ago. Not yourself at that age, but right now be at that age again. My answer to that was no. My mom's answer was no also. It shows that we are usually happy and content with the age we are at. All the experiences in our lives has brought us to this point. \n\nSorry for the long ass post. I just resonate with your thoughts and wanted to share what helps and helped me. Try to live in the same city with the people you love (I don't even do this but it has a big impact on the time you spend with them). Don't take life too seriously, just live it and ask yourself how you can enjoy life every day. Try to do those things and work towards goals that will allow you to do those. Be as social as possible, call and text people as they cross your mind, feel free to compliment and share positivity with everyone (even random people you see for the first time). All of these will make you feel better.\n\nHow to make peace with nothing lasting? That is in fact what Buddhism is all about!\nIn a nutshell, it's the 4 Noble Truths:  1) life is suffering (the suffering of impermanence)\n2) The cumulative causes for it. 3) Cessation of suffering  4) The way to end our suffering.\nIn short, our true Buddha-nature is pure bliss; by benefitting other beings via the Bodhisattva path over our many lifetimes,  we reclaim it, and reunite with love &amp; compassion.  Say YES to enlightenment!\n\nYou meditate, find silence, and then you realize everything lasts because time is just part of the human condition.\n\nGet to know that \"nothing.\" http://www.frogzen.com/meditations/\n\nI‚Äôve always found peace through the changes. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll find it again.\n\nThe Future never arrives because it's always in the future.\n\nWe are everything yet we are nothing!\n\nI was you and all others thinking,  you have to be open minded, if you wish to understand. \nI started opening my mind even deeper, looking for guidance, when I did I went to YouTube and Googled about spirituality and came across Christina Lopes. Wow, than one day came across Delores cannon,  wow wow, than came across Next level soul podcast, recently Shielded mind, chosen ones the other side of nde. Many stories  on NDE that will put your mind to rest.\n\nConsider the NOTHING to be everything all at once, then breathe and know it‚Äôll be okay no matter what hardships you are to endure through this life friend\n\nIf it wasn't for impermanence you life wouldn't have been possible and all the beautiful moments you had/have/will have the chance to live.\n\nI mean...the impermanence that will deprive you of everything is the very same thing that gave you all that stuff in the first place.\n\nSometimes we forget that this ride isn't free but at the same time we  could have not existed so that's kinda of a privilege isn't it?\n\n(If I committed some mistakes sorry english is not my first language)\n\nI haven't successfully done this in full yet, but it's my belief that we have to rewire our brains away from thinking about this moment's end. I think the best way to do that is reminding ourselves, in the moment of sadness about a good moment ending, that, hey, this IS a good moment though, and it didn't exist prior to itself, and we made thecmoment happen somehow, so it can happen again.\n\nThat's what keeps me going forward.\n\nNothing lasts - including the hard times.\n\nYou‚Äôre on the right track. ¬†The more the realization sinks in, the more your mind realizes it‚Äôs like holding a hot coal and will just let go. ¬†Things will continue to come and go, but you won‚Äôt grab onto it any more. ¬†\n\nThe end isn‚Äôt actually the end. Matter cannot be created nor destroyed. Therefore death is a transition. It is the end of our understanding of consciousness though. The truth that there is an end to consciousness makes life even sweeter. When I look at a cloud I see the ocean. I view my life like that too. Ebbing and flowing. I‚Äôm here and it‚Äôs now. This pain you‚Äôre referring to is an opportunity to live life to the fullest and help others.\n\nThe hear and  now is everything and ever lasting .\nThe birth death is just a cycle to make the other cycles of this reality work , your the infinite being .\n\nI don't knoooow üò•ü§£ practice?\n\nTherapy.\n\nI like knowing that we will live forever as it brings me comfort and peace knowing that when this body dies, i go up with the angels not the other way around. I hate this world telling us to enjoy this life  before you know it someday the light goes out. That brings so much anxiety. That‚Äôs cant be true. It cant be asi can see angels walking with us, flying above us or standing behind little kids. Somedays i am getting messages from the other side telling me things of God, love, peace, and solutions to problems i didn‚Äôt think of before. So i believe we are all immortal and will meet god soon. All you have to consider the fact that we are spirit beings temporarily living in a body for a short time and we chose to be here to enjoy each thing he offered us. This is what makes me feel happy and feel at peace.\n\nAnicha, anicha, anicha\n\nNothing lasts.  Everything returns to nothing.  Nothingness is peace.\n\nI think your realization of that fact should make you live in the present. Enjoy every moment, because it will eventually end. You will move on to some thing more worthwhile, or a temporary down time. No need to worry over anything\n\nAll we have is this moment, right now. That's why it's precious.\n\nI‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre going through this. Yes, it‚Äôs true that nothing is permanent. There is beauty and pain in knowing this. However, humans are equipped to handle the joy and loss of a full life. \nIf you think about the devastation now, you‚Äôre catastrophizing these events as if you won‚Äôt be able to handle the pain. You‚Äôre not realizing that you CAN handle the pain of loss; millions of people have done it before you and gone on to live happy lives. It‚Äôs also a choice. You can choose to remain in devastation and misery or you can grieve your loss in a healthy way and move forward. \nYour loved ones certainly don‚Äôt want you to live in misery once they are gone, as I‚Äôm sure you feel the same way for them. Life is full of joy and loss. I hope you can learn how to enjoy the good moments now so you don‚Äôt live in regret in your later years. \nAlso, therapy might help you channel some of this fear into something more productive like service work, journaling, or a hobby.\n\nLasts? The fun is in all experience.\n\nEverything is energy (including consciousness) - which cannot be created or destroyed.  When the physical body ends - consciousness transforms and continues.\n\njust like how you detach from your thoughts then emotions. you can detach from everything else\n\nIt's a real koan. The better it gets, the more it could hurt to lose. Still, try to enjoy wholeheartedly.\n\nIt doesn't end. You're just not sensitive enough to know that at this point, nor are most of the posters on this thread.\n\nWhat you're in now is just a simulation. It's necessary to think it's \"real\" for the purposes of learning whatever lessons you chose to work on. Sometimes people are able to figure it out, though.\n\nMost of the stuff we're taught in this material realm is not true. Religion is a good example of something that is not true. Religions are just ways humankind has made  to rationalize or find meaning in life. It actually might work for some people. Never worked for me.\n\nWhen your physical body dies, you turn into consciousness. You're still you, but you don't have a body. You are very, very happy. You get to see all your loved ones and they, too, are happy. Everybody loves everybody. This love thing is different than what we know of as love. It has to do with vibrations and being in synch with people who are vibrating at the same rate as you. When you are with those individuals it is like a drug. You feel wonderful, and that's putting it mildly. There really aren't words to describe it in our vocabulary.\n\nYou can't feel at the level they feel because you're in a body. This body has a dampening effect on emotion and vibration. You can experience it enough to know it exists, but if you are right next to a person who is consciousness, you realize you can't match those feelings and it is because of this body you're in.\n\nIf you decide you want to reincarnate, you do. Usually you make this decision along with individuals in your soul group. Think of it like a school. You're in a school now--it's not permanent and it's not the purpose of your existence. It's just a tool.\n\nYou won't be able to understand this, nor will most people reading. You'll deny and it and so will everyone else. This might be a built-in mechanism to be sure you get the most out of school, so to speak. It's something you have to come to all on your own. Another person, such as me, cannot tell you. I'm telling you, but I know at the sme time that it will mean nothing to you.\n\nOne last thing--if you do figure it out on your own, the reward is happiness. Maybe not 100% of the time, but 97% of the time. Also, it is a lot of work. You have to work at it every day. It takes hours of work each day, belief in yourself, and the willingness to walk in the dark, not knowing or being able to have anyone tell you if you're doing the right or wrong thing.\n\n  \non edit:  I wanted to comment on your despair of everything being temporary. There is a way you can relive any moment of your life if you want to. It's kind of like a library where you can go in and go to that moment. I've experienced numerous occasions.  It's just like experiencing it the first time, so it's temporary, yes, but you can re-experience it if you like.\n\nIt is a very wonderful thing, to be able to experience those moments.\n\nYou, on the other hand, are eternal."

I failed the 10 second test, passed the second, and when I saw the third challenge I stopped reading, stopped working, and took a 15 minute walk outside alone - and chatted with my wife when I got back before logging back into work and then reading this.\n\nI did it but I feel the automaton in me wanting to do stuff for the sake of it. Good post.\n\nI just want to say thank you. I was stupidly scrolling for the last 20 minutes. And now after I write this, I am turning my phone off and going outside. Its nice weather today. Sun is shining and the sky is beautifuly blue. \nHave a nice day\n\nthis was the highlight of reddit today. THANKS!  (made me smile hugely and breathe deeply, and chuckle a bit, and leave the electronics and go outside.)\n\nThis gave me enough space to escape the doom scroll. \n\nThanks m8, off to clean my room !\n\nAwesome thank you for reminding me!  üòä\n\nNope, I didn't. Wanted to know why I should 1st.\n\nThis is actually a good way to approach this sub, thanks a lot, I'm experienced in meditation and managed to pass the challenge, but it was very nice. Good idea üí°.\n\nI had no trouble with any of those requests. Why are the chances high if we respond we didn't meet the challenge? \n\nWhat exactly was the challenge?\n\nThe challenge is to give yourself the time that you deserve. To take a step back from Reddit, and pay attention to yourself. That‚Äôs all.\n\nWhy do you think that's a challenge? I did it, what was the challenge in it? \n\nI/you/we do not \"deserve\" anything, that is an ego desire, a judgement.\n\n&gt;Why do you think that's a challenge?\n\nI'm not exactly sure why. If I knew, I‚Äôm not sure it would be much of a challenge. Attachment and ignorance are certainly part of my automatic, addictive behavior on Reddit and social media.\n\n&gt;I did it, what was the challenge in it?\n\nTo be; To sit with your own presence; To detach yourself from Reddit for a moment.\n\nIf none of this made sense, I can elaborate further if you help me understand where you're coming from: Why are you in r/Meditation? What do you think are the challenges with meditation?\n\nCould you perhaps actually read what I've posted? \n\nI wrote 20+ paragraphs of text here and you're not actually responding to any of it.\n\nCould you actually read all of my posts in their entirety and see if you can figure out what I'm saying here because it's beyond clear that no one's responding is actually reading or responding to what I wrote.\n\nNo, sorry, I‚Äôm not gonna do that. My Reddit usage is high enough as it is, and I got things to do. But if you‚Äôre sincere, I‚Äôll elaborate in our thread. But that begins with you answering the two questions I just asked.\n\nOh okay, so you're just going to be the normal Reddit user and tell me I'm wrong without having read anything?\n\nYou are certainly optimizing the waste of time of you choose that!\n\nHave fun with that kind of posting.\n\nHonestly, I just want you to have a good time. That‚Äôs all I want for everyone. The challenge in this post may not be relevant to you at this time, and that‚Äôs fine. I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre stupid or less worthy because of that. We‚Äôre all at different stages of development, and it doesn‚Äôt change our value.\n\nI‚Äôm gonna get off Reddit now, make some coffee, and do some programming. Whatever you do, I hope you‚Äôre enjoying it.\n\nHave a nice day!\n\nYour post is again confusing..\n\nIt's like you read absolutely nothing of what I wrote here. Not a word.\n\nI did as you requested in the original post.\n\nThe challenge was not a challenge for me.\n\nHow could you possibly have misread what I have written do badly that you didn't understand I get what your saying and you don't understand that your own post was part of the consumption process you're outlinging here.\n\nYou failed your own challenge.\n\nOkay. No worries. Enjoy your day.\n\n[deleted]\n\nI did as you said. \n\nAnd you still haven't explained what the challenge was? \n\nIt's is done.

So no.\n\nWhy are you being intentionally obtuse over such a simple question?\n\n[deleted]\n\nNo one has tried to explain anything.\n\nYou feeling okay? \n\nWhat you have replied to is a response, not an answer, that you think there's an answer here is pretty rude at this point as I'm asking you simply to get to the point.\n\nIt sure sounds like ego responses here. \n\nI mean an appeal to desire and deserving? That's clearly ego driven. \n\nYou don't see that?\n\n[deleted]\n\n[removed]\n\nUnfortunately, your karma is too low to post.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Meditation) if you have any questions or concerns.*\n\nThank you I felt as if someone was right there with me helping me through my anxiety.\n\nHoly shit, great little exercise. Really brought me into the present moment.\n\nGreat post. Oh no I lost ;)\n\nNamaste üôè\n\nI think you bring up an excellent exercise in a way that comes across as pompous. With some rephrasing, it would be a lot less off-putting. That being said, I do appreciate your intention :)\n\nI didn't lose. I didn't accept the challenge. Why would I?

Out of curiosity, is that useful for the internet these days? Seems like every webpage I visit has so much going on with it that dial up would struggle.

    "title": "Meditation changed my life. Period.",
    "body": "Just sharing my life-changing experience. I come from a Hindu religious family. \n\nMeditation and astrology is in my blood. When one of my ancestors renounced the society to become a powerful rishi, my forefathers stopped practicing meditation. Don‚Äôt know if it was trauma from losing a family member even though it was for spirituality but only astrology knowledge was passed from one generation to another. In my generation, my sister got that gift. I was agnostic most of my life because I saw my narcissistic mother practicing religion out of fear and it made my skin crawl. \n\nBut something happened in 2020 and I gave meditation a try. Although there was no one to teach me, I found my way through trials and error. I started with structured meditation to resolve my emotional issues like need for validation from my mom I didn‚Äôt get along with, unhappiness in all kinds of relationships and deep dissatisfaction with my career. I have been practicing meditation daily since last 4.5 years for at least 25 mins if not more and I literally feel like a new person. Though I haven‚Äôt forgiven my mom but I don‚Äôt resent her, my self assurance is sky high, and for the first time in my life, I‚Äôm actually happy. I also started learning chants that strengthen my aura and energy in meditation and I‚Äôm mind blown. I don‚Äôt worry about my financial situation as I‚Äôve accepted that my job is to do my best but ultimately, what happens, happens. I‚Äôm not stressing about things outside my control. I changed my lifestyle and diet, and fortunately or unfortunately, I‚Äôve started experiencing things I could never imagine. \n\nFelt like sharing it after talking with my bff who is going through divorce and shattered self esteem. I offered to teach her meditation to deal with the stress but I don‚Äôt think she believes it will help her. Makes me sorry for people who ignore this powerful tool that can change their life for better.",

    "all_comment_text": "Thank you for this post. It definitely takes a couple of years for meditation to transform our being. These kind of stories will greatly encourage the beginners in meditation. They quite often get discouraged with the suffering that starts to surface after some time of meditation.\n\nI think the suffering starts because suddenly we become aware of the baggage we are carrying and it becomes overwhelming. I absolutely had that phase but I continued to push through because I do have trust issues and so I would rather like to resolve my issues on my own than go through the painful process of looking for a good therapist. And I do believe if we keep pushing through in this phase, the results are mind blowing.\n\nOP, you might be interested in checking out Sri SN Goenka and Vipassana Meditation.\n\nYes. Excellent recommendations. I live in the US and have dreamed of going to the center in India for a week long retreat. I have no doubt this will happen for me.\n\nYou don't need to specifically visit us here to learn Vipassana. There are centres in the US, some pretty good ones. Have you attended a ten day session?\n\nNo, I have not. I wasn't aware there were locations in the US. You said you knew of some pretty good ones. Would you mind recommending a few. I'm located in Arkansas, but could travel, of course.\n\nGlad to help. Here you go :)\n\nhttps://www.dhamma.org/en-US/locations/directory#US\n\nThank you!\n\nüòäüëç\n\nDO you have any method ? How do you meditate ?\n\nStart with taking deep breaths and focus on relaxing each part of my body and visualize negative energies like stress, sadness and disappointment leaving my body in form of black smoke. Then focus on my auras and then focus on a divine source of energy. I visualize these energies resolving my problems and affirming their love for me.\n\nHow long after you first started meditation did you notice definite positive changes? I know many give up when they fell that \"nothing happens\". Maybe if they had a sort of timeline to help them.....\n\nAfter 1.5 to 2 years. I know it sounds crazy but After a year, I started getting vague messages (sometimes in 2 days, sometimes in 2 weeks, and sometimes never lol) when I focused on certain problems, like whether the issue will resolve or not. And now I‚Äôm in a stage when I have a problem bothering me, a voice inside me asks me if it‚Äôs really worth losing sleep over it, and suddenly it‚Äôs like a light bulb goes off in my head and I‚Äôm at peace again. I know it doesn‚Äôt make much sense but I think you need blind faith when you meditate in divine powers that at the end of the day, everyone is loved, just their journey is different. And when you have that faith, life stops being painful.\n\nThat makes total sense to me.\n\nSeems like you're in a good spot. Congrats!\n\nThanks for sharing. I had a similar experience but what I noticed is that a lot of people don't know what meditation is. Most people think it is the act of sitting quietly and breathing for stress relief but what changed everything for me was guided meditation and taking it seriously. I have come out of meditations screaming because I unlocked some hidden pain that I never expressed but that came exploding back to the surface. My advice for your friend is to go into with something to work on, letting go, healing, codependence and letting those emotions be the reason.\n\nAbsolutely. I did guide her and also offered to help her with the sessions. Hopefully she will take me on my offer.\n\nCan you share where you found effective guided meditations?\n\nActually I just saw one meditation randomly and then just started doing it on my own.\n\na wonderful thing to hear. :) keep up the important work to better love yourself and this world!\n\nSame. It has changed my life.\n\nI‚Äôm so glad. How long have you been practicing?\n\nI started in 2018. There were fits and starts but really saw big changes beginning in 2022. \ni was a broken person and let my past trauma run my life. Plus the negative self talk in my head. I was a mess. Now, it is so much more peaceful and calm. Almost fully off depression meds. Just having to go down slowly due to so many years of use.\n\nI‚Äôm so happy for you ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nMeditation is the single most valuable activity we can do for the betterment of all aspects of our personal lives, and for the betterment of all of humanity.\n\nThis is so nice to read. Can you share what chantings you do?\n\nSince last one year, I‚Äôm focusing on Shiva Shakti. So first I chant mantras for Shakti, Om Aim Hrim Shrim Klim, and then I focus on Shiva and chant, Om Namah Shivay. And then I visualize both Shiva and Shakti coming together to bless me and again chant the first mantra. \n\nAlso, according to Devi Bhagwat Purana, the first mantra not only symbolizes all the main three Devis in Hinduism, who also stand for various forms of feminine energies, but they are also symbolic of chakras. So when you chant this mantra, your chakras and aura are empowered. It‚Äôs just like how we need to eat daily to nurture our body, we need such powerful chants to nurture our soul.\n\nDoesn't these mantras require Diksha?\n\nNo\n\nI thought they did since they are Beej?\n\nNah. The beauty of Hinduism is, these are safe without the issue of disksha. At least that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been told.\n\nHmm. What have you noticed while chanting them?\n\nPeace and powerful energies.\n\nCan you guide me please!would be happy to learn.currently going through post Partum depression and was laid off from my job.we as couple spent half a crore on my mother in law treatment for an year and she passed away.\nSo much happened in last year and unable to cope up.\n\nSure. DM me.\n\nYes. All of this. I have practiced intermittently for twenty years but for the last 8 months my whole life has turned around.\n\nI live in the US, but studying ancient spiritually (Hinduism, Buddhism, etc) has thoroughly convinced me that meditation and a variety of different meditation practices to choose from should be taught in every single primary/elementary/beginner school in the world!! In just one generation, it would completely change the world. Thank you so much for sharing your journey. It really warmed my heart and made me smile. Sending you love!\n\nI would suggest go more deep into this and start to learn about aura and energy. I guess ur pitra will guide just ask for it in that state. Lovely story of urs and could relate a lot\n\nI‚Äôm reading Devi Bhagwat Puran, which talks about feminine energy that I sometimes see in my meditation and mentions how to meditate to elevate energies.\n\nAccha. U started with a great one. I wish I could have a guru to get these.\n\nMy guru is mahadev. He will show me the way :)\n\nGreat I got one of my answers thank u\n\nBeen meditating over a decade. Eventually you realize nothing matters at all - but in the best way possible. Feels like being completely free and in flow. Everything is vibrant.\n\nGo with it\n\nOP, can you please give more details on how meditation actually changed your life. Did it make your more positive and fearless?\n\nI don‚Äôt have any insecurities anymore, including financial. I don‚Äôt crave emotional validation from anyone anymore. I‚Äôm actually happy being on my own. I move away from any relationship, be it family or friends, the moment drama starts. I no longer feel the need to justify myself to anyone, I‚Äôd explain myself and hear the other party but I won‚Äôt put in the effort to convince anyone of anything if they don‚Äôt want to. And finally, I‚Äôm exhilarated to be single üòÖ\n\nWonderful to hear! I have been practicing since 2014 on and off. I notice when I do not do it I feel completely out of balance mentally and emotionally.\n\nI feel more peace inside my mind and in my heart. However, I notice when I fall off and the monkey mind starts going crazy. Trying to pick meditation back up becomes challenging due ti the constant thoughts and emotions that keep me feeling fidgety. How do you navigate this? \n\nI tend to use guided meditations or yoga nidra before bed. \n\nThere are all these different types of meditations that tend to overwhelm me with feeling maybe I am doing my version wrong. \n\nI have noticed it takes me about 20 to get settled and in that meditative state. On good days maybe 10.\n\nI struggle with insecurities and defensiveness from an abusive mother wound. Any feed back or guides on what helps you stay consistent and make it a daily practice is appreciated üôÇ\n\nSometimes in the initial phases, you need to force yourself to meditate even for 10 mins. Think of it as food for your soul. As you need to nurture your body with food to function in this physical body, you need to meditate to nurture your soul. On bad days, just force yourself to take deep breaths and visualize all your sadness, exhaustion and disappointment leaving your body in form of black smoke. Meditate daily for at least 160 days without fail and then you will likely never fall off the wagon.\n\nYou wrote that: \"...Although I haven't forgiven my mother, but I don't hold a grudge against her, my self-confidence is very high and for the first time in my life I am truly happy...\"\n\n\n\nYou don't have to forgive your mother for anything, just forgive yourself. What we remember about others, what we think about them, and what we feel when we see them is just our idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthem... Nothing more.\n\nAbsolutely. For my whole life, I felt I was unlovable because I used to think even when my own mother couldn‚Äôt love me, how could anyone else. Now I simply don‚Äôt care because I‚Äôm enough for myself :)\n\nThis is so lovely. Meditation was the game changer for me. Helped me learn to love myself, to figure out who I am, what I believe. Helped me to realize that I AM OK. More than ok. I am so happy to hear that it's helped others. I will never stop meditating. and trying to teach others about it.\n\nMeditation is not for every one.\n\nI strongly disagree unless you are just observing your thoughts. Then you may as well just go to sleep.\n\nSadhguru said so.\n\nWhat meditation did you do to not seek love/validation from mom?\n\nTelling myself that I‚Äôm child of universal divine energy in my meditative state. My mom in this world is the mother of my body, not my soul. I kept doing it for a few months and now whatever my mom does, it doesn‚Äôt matter.\n\nGreat... I also have to realise this thing . Thankyou üôè\nIs there a particular audio for this thing or I just have to repeat this thing in my mind during meditation?\n\nYou will need to talk to yourself about this and visualize that divine power loving you like your mother never did.\n\nJust curious to know the astrological knowledge passed\n\nI didn‚Äôt get that. I can only feel the energy of basic tarot cards but my sister can actually read horoscope in a couple of ways, she understands remedies of black magic and can read various decks of tarot cards. Actually it‚Äôs funny in a way now. Thanks to opening of my chakras, I can see spirits, good or bad, but I don‚Äôt know how to get rid of evil spirits. My sis is not in meditation but she knows how to get rid of evil spirits. So now we kind of complement each other.\n\nI'm glad for you! meditation can be life changing for your brain, the benefits are insane! Just can't help but comment that astrology, is basically a pseudo-science that was originally invented by the babylonians! It has nothing to do with meditation .. even signs positions on the sky change over the years largely due to earth's wobble! it does a complete cycle every 26000 yrs"

    "body": "I'm not actually boring, but you'd never know it by talking to me at a party. In the past few years, as meditation has taken root and changed me, I've gotten even less inclined to weigh in on a conversation than I was. I figure other people are going to say all of the things and I can wait. Or my thoughts aren't worth the effort (it's at least half this, once you see that the thoughts are not worth a whole lot it's silly to offer them up). Half of what goes through my mind is \"have you ever tried just Not?\"\n\nHow do you stay social when so much interaction feels like very uncomfortable noise? I've always been introverted, it's gotten more pronounced with age. I do like people, I don't want to be impossible to be around.",

    "all_comment_text": "You‚Äôre also likely the only one actively listening‚Ä¶good on ya. Silently validating others‚Äô communication efforts through active attention is still participating in the social dynamic in an important way.\n\nThis really reframes it for me. Ty\n\nAlso Theravadan Buddhism talks a lot about ‚Äúnot getting attached to views and opinions‚Äù, so maybe you‚Äôre just starting to realize that what *you* think matters about as little as what other people think.\n\nLike, if it‚Äôs useful in the moment or funny, make use of it but then move on.\n\nWhile that's great and I certainly had the experience for the first years, people really appreciated my presence, it changed later. I became more and more like op described it and nonattachment turned into not caring. Nothing seemed like it mattered. Pair that with very challenging life situation and thinking that letting everything go and forgiving everything will solve everything lead me into depression.\n\n After about 2-3 years I'm slowly coming out of it with therapy and taking a break from long daily meditations and other routines. The current learning seems to be that there's a part of me that wants to be seen and express itself, like anger for example. A part that wants to let go sometimes and not stick 100% to high goals of whatever spiritual practices say I should do. A part that can say no, or fuck off when my boundaries are being crossed repeatedly, instead of meditating myself out of those emotions. \n\nI still remember many learnings from before, but it seems like life wanted to show me that I won't \"get away\" so easily and that I still need to face challenges and deal with the needs of my person hood and can't just float away in the spiritual realm. Maybe spiritual bypassing... I was aware of it I thought but life's a real trip sometimes... It's hard work again to meditate sometimes, but I've not gone back to hour long Vipassana sessions and focus on more simple techniques that actually feel good üòâ\n\nGreat points. Glad that you ultimately had the insights to change the way you interact with life, and acted on it, stuck with meditation as a lifestyle in a way that better supports your goals.\n\nYour experience exemplifies the need for people to find the meditation style best suited to where they are mentally and emotionally, and change approaches when appropriate.\n\nFlexibility is a big asset\n\nThe meditation style I used worked very well for me. But as my life situation changed, it wasn't a good match anymore and this whole spiritual persona became kind of performative. Doing it because I thought it's the what I needed to do and it used to work and I liked the idea of being like that.\n\nAt a point it became pretty self destructive. Beating myself up for not working hard enough as past traumas flared up. At that point I should have switched into a self care mode I think now. Not striving for more and more, as I was already struggling.\n\nThank you for taking the time to respond.\n\n‚ÄòGood‚Äô is definitely relative!\n\nI think that meditation can be a trigger, in that as you integrate new ways of being you find things, good and bad. You realize you are in pain, or you have more courage than you knew. I‚Äôm glad that process was good for you, it‚Äôs hard work\n\nYes there are many dimensions to uncovering yourself. Lots of layers and it's never a straight process. Somehow, I the past, seeing my own pain made me more compassionate to others. Now I need every bit of energy to focus on myself and family.\n\nCertainly some general growing pains involved and coming to terms with traumatic past experiences and how those still live in the present.\n\nI don't know if I can say that the process was \"good\", it certainly was and is very painful at times. but I also wouldn't say I wanted it any other way as this is what it is and I need to figure it out from here.\n\nThank you for taking the time and responding. And thank you for writing about these tough realities we can find ourselves in on this path.\n\nü§ó\n\nBuddhism talks about nonattachment. We shouldn't be attached to meditation or a certain lifestyle, with other words: some spiritual practitioners gets attached to the practice,¬† and identify themselves with it a lot. I think we then could distance ourselves too much from our personality.¬† For instance, if we get in a special state of mind during practice, it is our personal experience while meditating, and it's an experience that we can't so easily share with others.¬† And then we might feel a bit isolated from others, or feel that we have a world of our own that we maybe can't explain to others. It of course depends on who we socialize with.\nMaybe meditate a bit less? in order to connect with others again? Also, not to use meditation to run away from something or someone,¬† of course. It's sometimes not so easy to see what we are doing to ourselves or what we are avoiding. But it's good to be open and ask ourselves what's going on.¬†\nAnyway... let's not give up yoga and meditatingü§ó\n\nThank you for taking the time to respond.\n\nYou are hitting on lots of appropriate points for me. The lifestyle thing slowly creeped in even though I thought I was aware of this trap.\n\nI rarely felt the need to share my experience with others as I understood it doesn't mean much to them as it was my experience alone. But the sense of loneliness and abandonment was a topic that flared up from the past. Doing things that most people never do, not doing things that most people do. This with trauma from the past getting reactivated was and is very challenging and created the belief that there's no point in sharing my feelings and thoughts because nobody will be able to understand and help anyway. Again this happened slowly and took a while to discover and correct.\n\nI think meditation and spirituality is often presented like something that can magically solve all of our problems. And while it can help to not suffer so much, we still need to deal with being a human and all the challenges that our life situation brings. So that was a rough awakening.\n\nI miss the time when I felt so deeply connected to myself/the source and could explore my inner world so freely. At the same time I hope that I can rebuild this sense while not losing connection to the physical world. Maybe a phase that could take a couple of years.\n\nYoga is another good example of something that felt like magic, but I struggle with now as I often end up feeling irritated ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\n\nHi\nI don't  know about Vipassana so deeply as I did 4 ten day courses only but I think meditation is not a way which can solve anything but it changes the way we approach a problem, life and its challenges will already be there, only the attitude and approach changes through Meditation\nIf Meditation feels you that way, then you are on right way of doing it. If it is working some other way as you said you should seek help from Vipassana teacher.\n\nVipassana what I think make you feel happiness in a better sense and sadness with a patience, not creating any attachment or aversion to both.\n\nBut as you told, it is doing something else to you. I think what Goenka ji says whenever you feel something is not correct, go to basic which is the core of vipassana and ask - are you creating aversion or attachment to anything?\nHope my small knowledge adds some value to your thoughts\n\nI'm afraid you might be right. Meditation did feel like magic to me at times. Like me changing my inner world getting reflected in the material world. Bodily ailments disappearing. Stuff just working out and coincidences working in my favour, flowing. Some other unexplainable stuff happening. Maybe it's a trap, maybe there's more to it.\n\nMaybe it only worked while I was in a balanced state but the challenging life circumstances and my reaction to them as well as past trauma cut me off again. I'm trying to work with what I have now.\n\nI'm trying to befriend myself again now. Going a bit easier on myself. Even as I notice that it's like falling asleep again.\n\nThank you for the reminder about focusing on the basics. The simple techniques seem to work best right now. Cleaning out my house so to speak, letting go and becoming still.\n\nThank you once again for offering your attention, it means a lot üôè\n\nBeautiful\n\nYou say more boring but maybe its more intersting, chit chatting about nothing is boring to me and I'm more aligned to people who speak when they feel they need to.\n\nSmall talk for small talks sake absolutely boils my piss.\n\nI'm thinking of one person at my work in particular who cannot just be silent. It's not positive things either. It's complaints and negative noise.\n\nI'm generally not rude so will listen to a point. It's not a conversation either. Nothing you say will steer it in any direction. Really allways a strange interaction with this person.\n\nYeah I know of people like this, you can't wait to get away but don't like being rude so you end up trying to give hints you have to leave and they witter on.\n\nI call them out. I'm too old to care about *me* being rude to someone else who's fucking *annoying*. Or I walk.\n\nMy goodness man \nI usually take a step away to try and hint that I‚Äôm done speaking but they find another topic and I‚Äôm like ‚Äòdamn, again‚Äô\n\nYes, maybe it‚Äôs not worse, but differently better!\nTo come back to the chatter, that reassures me... are you saying that you don't practice basic conversation, that of saying nothing, small talk, but that which serves to put you at ease? \nFor my part, I am incapable of having this type of conversation, and am therefore often very uncomfortable as long as we are not on a specific theme.\nI prefer engaged, involved and learning conversations.\nAm I normal then üòÖ?\n\nYeah really don't do the small talk much these days about dissing someone, moaning about this and that or just talking about nothing for the sake of it, in the UK lots of people seem afraid of silence and feel they have to fill the air with chat all the time, I've noticed lots of other European countries this isn't so much the case, it might sound bad but I somewhat see it as waste of energy to go on chatting about nothing much, I'll be friendly to people and if its a meaningful subject I'm all in.\n\nMaybe you have changed and are no longer aligned with the people/conversations that you used to be.\n\nThis! You attract higher vibration people who prefer deeper and more meaningful relationships. Don‚Äôt sacrifice yourself for the sake of fitting in with the majority. Not everyone deserves to know your story and the true depth of you and what makes you interesting. Those who truly care will seek it out and actively listen\n\nI feel like vipassana by itself sometimes leaves me disconnected from people in this sort of alien state of \"everything is fabricated\". Metta meditation is the cure. Yes, it's a fabrication but since we can't live without fabrication I'd rather fabricate a wholesome happy self than a pseudo-transcedental, dissociated self (which can be the tendency with pure vipassana).\n\nThanks!\n\nI take a broad view of \"we're all doing this together\" in the vein of the story of Guan Yin, and hold a strong experience based belief of \"playfulness is the swiftest path to connection and growth\".\n\nSo, maybe you don't have any opinions to offer, or advice to weigh in with, but try asking yourself \"how can I bring joy to those here\", or \"how deeply can I listen to these people\" depending on the situation, and see if that helps you feel more connected to the beings you share the planet with.\n\nQuality/quantity: be present, listening for topics meaningful to you\n\nListening as engagement: Drive their conversation by participating by asking open ended questions - you can sometimes steer Q over Q (first paragraph).\n\nI can flip into Bartender Mode easily, I have some great questions, when I do pipe up it‚Äôs usually funny, that‚Äôs what people remember about me. I did this kind of work for decades and I still would rather feed you and get you a wine and comfy seat than talk much. I love to facilitate an introduction or conversation, to do something concrete and helpful. The service industry is too horrible, but I liked the work.\n\nShare those versatile questions you have in ur pocket üòÅ\n\nYou don‚Äôt usually need more than one or two. What do you do for fun? (Many variations of that) What brings you here? (Excellent for specific situations, activities around shared interest). Look for ways to draw people out that don‚Äôt use their work to define them. And having a few oddball questions can lighten things up, like ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the worst meal your mom cooked and you had to eat?‚Äù\n\nThe other tip is to notice the person. Find something nice about them and appreciate it. If someone you just met says ‚Äúyou have the most delightful laugh‚Äù, you‚Äôll probably remember it forever.\n\nThank you! ü´∂üèª\n\n&gt;Thank you! ü´∂üèª\n\nYou're welcome!\n\nSame. I stick to my wife, 1 best friend, occasionally few other friends I‚Äôve know since ever and our cats and dogs and that‚Äôs enough for me. I‚Äôm happy that way.\n\nParty convo is usually mundane and light. Opposite of what introverts crave .\nIts likely that party's are the wrong setting for you to be talkative.\n\nOh, I avoid them when possible but last night was obligatory. Tonight is a much smaller dinner and I will be fine. Still quiet, but not stressed about it\n\nI can really relate to this. Honestly I try to avoid situations that involve small talk altogether, but it's obviously not always avoidable. \n\nI heard this maybe on a podcast or this sub: focus on your inner ear when people are talking to ground yourself in the present moment. I've been practicing this even in mundane conversations to really understand what the person is saying and any underlying needs that they may be expressing. And when I do speak up, I ask questions. People tend to like me because I show interest in them. And it's not a fake interest‚Äî everyone has a unique story and experience and it IS interesting, so I try to get to the heart of it if the conversation permits it. It's almost like a game for me. Because I really don't care about most worldly topics... so I just try to focus on individuals and steer the conversation that way if I can. And if I can't, then I say nothing, and that's fine, too. Most people are only worried about themselves.\n\nEngage with people through a heart of loving-kindness\n\nIt sounds like I should focus on metta for a while. Thanks for confirming\n\nMetta is always the right answer! But more than just meditating on it ‚Äî bring it into your everyday interactions. Drop the mind and all the nonsense around self-image and comparison and whether you‚Äôre doing this right or wrong. Center yourself in the openness at your heart, and engage from there, not from the head.\n\nNotice your aversion to other people and attend to that.  That's the answer to becoming irritable and disconnected.  There are no others.  All is Self.\n\nSome of the effects of meditation can be more clarity, efficiency and economy in speech, action, and thought.\n\nDo you find similar effects on your actions and thoughts?\n\nYes, to a lesser degree. One big change is what happens after I have been following a silly line of thought and catch it. It crumbles into nothing, it might even take a few seconds for me to be able to remember what it was. It really takes the wind out of your sails.\n\nThis is the clarity of thought.  You realize the thought is silly and simply and let it go.\n\nYou've described something similar to what's called the one way door.  There's a thought that's let go of, and when you look back, there's nothing there, and sometimes you can't even remember what it was. \n\nFor me, it's when I worry about future events.  I'm able to let them go, and after the event in wondering what I was so worried about.\n\nKeep up the practice and you'll be amazed what comes next.\n\nThe one way door! That‚Äôs a good description.\n\nyea this has happened to me as well; people tend to interpret my silence as arrogance, its moreso disinterest which I don't think is a bad thing. when you meditate you realize how much more impactful stillness can be. if I could recommend anything it would be to hang around people who value and understand the importance of silence\n\nI think what you‚Äôre realizing is that you need less stimulation to be contented. Congratulations.\n\nNow I had these problems early on. The thing is, when u feel a \"unwanted mental state\". That is the perfect opportunity to meditate. U get closer to emotion and better understand it, and once u better understand it, you know how to deal with it better , you would even learn how to prevent it.\n\nMeditation is.... idk how to describe what it's like. It's like self-troubleshooting for humans I guess? Self therapy?\nI can't make any comparisons except exercise, but even exercise is missing some of the common threads.\n\nlol I was trying to not be the person who reads in a corner. I did try a few quick meditations but it was too weird. Staring at the wall also seems antisocial.\n\nIt's hard, but keep being present.\n\nI don't care for most conversations around me, they are mostly just noise. But I do listen, and I may engage when I feel like it's appropriate for me, not them. \n\nIt seems all people talk about is politics, sports, tragedies and whatever is happening around them world, other people. Mostly just complaining. That does not intrest me. They can't complain themselves to a better mindset.\n\nWe are all different, not everyone you will encounter will be interesting to you. Just treat them as you want them to treat you, truthfully. \nThere is nothing wrong with being different.\n\nI'm an ambivert who has recently taken up Meditation, while studying tenets of Stoicism and Buddhism. I too have noticed I've become more quiet. I'm very passionate by nature, so normally I'd jump in with my thoughts. Does this roll back make me dull? Not sure. My need to be social has declined too. I prefer a more curated circle of close friends, and alone time. My energy has shifted too.\n\nI can very much relate to this! I‚Äôve noticed that I don‚Äôt complain as much. A lot of small talk is really about people‚Äôs problems, dealings-something that didn‚Äôt work right. I don‚Äôt really desire to participate in that as much. It already took up my time not working, why am I gonna talk about it now and take up more time lol¬†\n\nI have no problem small talking when it‚Äôs something of interest or something nice but all the blah blah daily life-I got a flat tire, works sucks-just to fill up space. No thanks!¬†\n\nI‚Äôm also ok with silence even for just a few moments here and there. Silence seems to cause a lot of people anxiety almost.¬†\n\nI like what someone said about active listening! No one is actually listening when all that chatter is happening. If you stand back and observe, a lot of times you notice everyone is actually just talking to themselves, but in a group lol\n\nPersonally I don‚Äôt think enjoying your practice, being aware of the benefits-serenity and calmness that comes from it and wanting to continue for those reasons is a form of attachment. I feel attachment would be-this is awesome! Then you add 5 more sessions a day\n\n\"Boring\" is nothing more than the outcome to \n\nmaking Other people responsible for putting \n\nmeaning or purpose in what you do.\n\n\n People who are actively involved in pursuing \n\ntheir Purpose don't get bored.\n\nThis is a healthy thing . I‚Äôve been consistently meditating. I feel similar in a way. I feel less need to input my own thoughts , feelings , or beliefs in a conversation. Most people can only see things from their level of awareness. You could say something to someone and their own awareness will filter it , to where they can only understand it at that level. So most of the time it really is a waste of time. Unless someone is receptive to you. Most people‚Äôs egos will block them from receptivity. From my level of awareness I think this is a healthy thing to grow inside of you.\n\nFrom my level of awareness to yours üòÜ\n\nI don‚Äôt have as many opinions to really weigh in as often. However when I do speak it‚Äôs usually something from the heart. \n\nThe truth is ineffable, words never truly touch what is, so often words aren‚Äôt necessary. Simply being present is enough.\n\nLet‚Äôs meet up in the ‚Äúboring corner‚Äù\nSeriously \nNo judging, no looking back. Things just are different \nI met a Swede he said they had a yearly cross-buddhist party in Stockholm. I was puzzled and asked him: party for Buddhists? üßò \nYes. I would have loved to witness that\n\nIf parties came with boring corners, I‚Äôd go to more of them. See ya there!\n\none thing that i enjoy doing at a party is looking for the person who seems left out of the conversation and engaging with them. i try to make sure everyone feels seen. its a refreshing change from 'i need to entertain'\n\nI have been in the spirtiual community for 20 years now. I have practiced in many traditions, traveled the world to different centers, sat long courses in different traditions, lived in India &amp; Nepal as a western meditation practitioner.. I don't know if meditation translates to the western mind in the long run. I have found some of the most miserable people I have ever met in this community. The first 5-10 years are sometimes beautiful but almost all aging folks struggle significantly with mental health and are super miserable. I actually stopped sitting because of this. Dance is my main practice now- ecstatic dance to be specific. \n\nI have also seen the majority of teachers I have got close to do horrible things to their students- eastern and western teachers. \n\nRide the pink cloud, take some of the lessons, practice mindfulness but honestly idk about westerners becoming serious practitioners. \n\nI was all kinds of fucked up after 10 years and spent another 10 trying to convince myself that I needed more of what was making me sick. \n\nI still sit but only for short periods.\n\nWow, do you think it could be because it attracts people who practice because they feel the need to \"fix\" themselves, whereas happy people tend not to have that urge? The teacher thing is strange as well, maybe the \"power\" that comes with the position attracting certain people or changing them? So do you think active kind of meditation like walking is better? Or could something like playing an instrument be just as good?\n\nThat's a good question ü§î  I seldom meet truly \"happy\" people.  I think short amounts of meditation is healthy (30-45 minutes a day) I'm more speaking about folks who become serious practitioners.\n\nAnd I do believe certain people are attracted to meditation.\n\nreally loving this conversation - it has made me aware of being in a similar situation without realising it - thank you\n\nI feel the same way most days. I‚Äôve made a concerted effort to be more vocal in social situations because people do want to know what you have to say. I find that it was hard for me because I felt like no one cared as much about my opinion as me. Especially since I‚Äôve meditated and fasted and done things over the years to align myself with a higher purpose there‚Äôs been a constant push &amp; pull to get to go out and be around people more. I neglected to hear others when they told me I distance myself from them, when I was thinking they didn‚Äôt want me around. \nI say all that to say, maybe it‚Äôs not so bad to offer your opinion even in the slightest way. Or join in on a conversation or two just because. We‚Äôre all humans in the grand scheme of the cosmos and others may look to us unknowingly, for insight on things plaguing their mind. Meditation is the way.\n\nMeditate on light\n\nActively listening, so that when you do say something, it will have real value\n\nI'm still in the phase where I talk to them about all the weird stuff I've gotten into lately and it usually draws a crowd of either non-believers or true-believers.  Either way it provides me hours of material if I so choose, to carry on conversations.   But I definitely feel less like being the center of attention than in the before times when I was mostly ego and a deep desire to be right all the time (a last word junkie.)\n\nI am exactly the same! I prefer being one on one with friends. It usually makes conversations better and you don't get all the polite chatter you have to get through when there are more people around.\n\nIn my experience as an introvert who's worked hard to be more open to social interactions (due to both my job and family necessities), it's IMPOSSIBLE for me to feel comfortable around certain people/characters. It's a dead-end without any workaround whatsoever. It's been an issue with my girlfriend in the shape of \"you don't try to spend time with my friends,\" but she doesn't realize that I don't want to spend much time even around MY OWN friends anymore. However, As some sort of compensation, I appreciate developing very deep relations that I absolutely cherish with people one-on-one, and I'll be doing great as long as we remain a party of two. It's almost like I don't know how to accommodate a third wheel in many engagements that previously involved only a particular friend and I. \n\nI doubt that I said anything useful here, but I think avoiding people because of the way you feel and are is perfectly fine as long as a crucial line of communication (like you and your boss, for example) isn't broken.\n\nAll these things will change over time. Sometimes there are big swings into what feels like not caring but that is your brain and personality  trying to adjust to the new calmer energy. This will in a large way pass. In some cases you will be drawn to new people to hang out with or become more solitary but still happy. That can be normal too, the universe will generally bring you what you need over time. Some time periods are for shedding and some are for growth and adding. Let them happen naturally if possible. When the time comes you may be surprised what kind of new and exciting information or new things to care about may present themselves that you wouldn‚Äôt have been ready for prior to calming down and getting more quiet and those things might inspire you deeply and cause a lot more thought activity and external action again. Hold the center and try to let things develop as they will, trying to stay honest with yourself, authentic to your self and with yourself, and also keeping an open mind and curiosity about everything, even the way you think you are now or have become. Everything will change and continue to grow.\n\nThank you! There is so much wisdom and generosity in this discussion.\n\nNot sure how old you are, but I've gotten much less social with age.  I don't meditate but it makes sense to me that in so doing, especially an introvert might become even more settled within themselves, feeling even less than ever like they have to \"weigh in\" if they don't feel so inclined. \n\nOver the last several years, I've noticed that even with good friends and family, what I have to say is heart most of the time but makes no real impression.  I guess it never really has unless it was \"Free tickets to (Popular musician or sports event). I can't go!\" or \"Guess What?  Nordstrom Rack is 1/2 off of everything for the next 8 hours.  HURRY!\"  And then, there's always, \"Does anyone want my chocolate cake?  I'm full.\"\n\nFor whatever reason, when I talk about something that really matters to me and that I think might be of interest to others, well, I can tell it's just not very meaningful to them at all.   So, I keep those treasures to myself, sometimes record and keep them in an online folder.  \n\nI understand your logic completely and urge you to accept and trust that you will speak if and when you want to.  Quiet, intelligent, confident, peaceful people are not impossible to be around.  They speak when they feel the urge to do so, not because they think they should or are trying to be \"first\" with a thought or impress someone.  I think it's a sign of growth to allow others to say what you're thinking and just let it go.  Even without, \"Yes, my thought exactly.\"  \n\nNo way that being quiet and speaking when you feel like it makes you impossible to be around.  It makes you authentic!!  My favorite kind of person.\n\nVery nice, thanks. I have a feeling that people are just as interested as they have always been, which isn‚Äôt very, but you are more attuned to it now. I love a good story!\n\nIt sounds like you‚Äôre talking about integrating meditation into social interactions, which is what I practice in [Relatefulness](https://relateful.com)\n\nSame. Most questions I just want to un-ask for people. Like, sorry, but there is no gold down that particular rainbow. But instead I ask why do you need to believe that? How do you know that for sure? What do you mean by that word? \n\nI have become an irritating Socratic type, I guess.\n\nlol unask.\n\nSuch is the path of becoming ‚Äòenlightened‚Äô. The old falls away to give space for new endeavours, new friendships, new adventures\n\nYou stay away from drama\n\nWow, what an amazing collection of responses! The convos are really illuminating. Thank you to everyone here, I‚Äôm so glad I asked about this! Your stories are touching. \n\nI‚Äôm not a higher vibration being. I feel like, right now, I finally have some idea of what meditating is but by tomorrow I will have forgotten.\n\nYou are right to not socialize, the average person nowdays is a crazy monkey they arent actually connecting when they are socializing, they are just trying to buff up thier egos. Once you see it you cant unsee it. try adding metta meditation to your routine and show some love\n\nMake an effort\n\nYou should read some of the responses here, they are great. üòÄ\n\nIf you are a man, try nofap.\n\nWut\n\nYou're telling me."

    "body": "For a long time I said that I can't meditate, because after three or four minutes I just quit and open my eyes. Often I would sit down and say I'm going to meditate for ten minutes or die trying, I still failed.\n\nWhat worked for me is to meditate for five minutes every hour, on the hour. Sit somewhere comfortable. Stay still. Close your eyes. Count your breaths from one to ten. Once you reach ten, start from one and repeat. Eventually, your mind will wander. When you notice it wandering, don't be self-critical. Noticing is the whole point. Every time you catch yourself wandering and escort your attention back to the breath, it is like a biceps curl for the brain. Eventually the timer will ring.",

    "all_comment_text": "One famous way of looking at it is that the mind is a monkey running up and down a tree. Mediation is not trying to hold the monkey still, merely focusing the mind on the tree until the monkey quietens down himself.\n\nThis is a superb way of looking at it as I feel there is a common misconception that meditating is about eliminating thoughts.\n\nIt's about recognising the thoughts. Am I correct?\n\nSomething to consider if you don‚Äôt feel good after meditating:\n\nI realized I had been using something I had picked up from time with Amma, and it makes me smile while doing it. \n\nWhen breathing in, picture healing bright or golden light streaming into your body. Then on the out breath, envision that same light streaming out of all your pores, particularly the heart and any hurting parts, making your whole body glow. \n\nI picture the pain flaking off in sparkling bits and flying away with the light, and repeat this with each breath. It‚Äôs something I‚Äôve started doing any time I‚Äôve been ‚Äúfocusing on the breath‚Äù. I find it soothing and it makes me smile. Thought it might be helpful for you too.\n\nI'll try it out, thank you so much, man.\n\nThank you.\n\nWhat is AMMA\n\nSorry, I copied that from what I sent to a friend who knew her. She is an Indian lady known as ‚ÄúThe Hugging Saint‚Äù. I‚Äôm not sure if links are allowed in this sub but she‚Äôs easy to look up. I first met her about 25 years ago during the darkest time of my life. An online friend posted about meeting her, and I desperately needed some kind of help. I am only 4 hours from Chicago and she travels there every year (part of a N American tour) where she puts on public programs and gives hugs to anyone who wants one. The hug is her blessing (aka darshan). The music and programming is all very Indian, but I‚Äôm just a generic white American and she‚Äôs been an inspiration to me for years. She promotes no specific religion, just an unconditional ‚ÄúMother‚Äôs Love‚Äù. When meditating (which I‚Äôve only recently started doing consistently) I will often sit and imagine seeing through her eyes, hugging and blessing any person who comes to me. It‚Äôs been especially helpful in feeling compassion for people who have wronged me or a*holes I don‚Äôt like. Sometimes I have to imagine these people as the innocent children they once were, and imagine giving them the love and guidance they needed to turn out differently and be better adults. I can also imagine myself as a child, providing the love and compassion I needed then. It‚Äôs pretty effective. \n\nBut anyway, she runs charities and schools and countless programs to help the poor, taking care of people‚Äôs basic needs so they can focus on their spiritual needs. She is often a part of international peace summits, and was mentioned in James Doty‚Äôs book Mind Magic. This is the sequel to his memoir ‚ÄúInto the Magic Shop‚Äù, where he tells about learning meditation and manifestation from a woman in a magic shop when he was 12. It enabled him to break free of his poverty and pain to do and be and have everything he wanted in life. But he has been my inspiration to take up meditation in earnest recently. I want to finally gain some control over my life and break free of what has been keeping me isolated and lonely. \n\nI know that was much more info than you were asking for, but I needed to share it! I hope it is helpful.\n\nImma try this and ascendü™∑üòÇ\n\nSweet! üòÑ\n\n*edit: format I shall not. Suggestion: read this with mindful intent to digest. You will get what you want or maybe what you need. \n\nGreat tactic! I‚Äôd like to add that there are many ways to meditate besides just sitting and breathing. Methods listed below can assist in building the mental mindset to improve the classic western meditation practice. (This list is from google and I added my personal notes) \n\nMindfulness Meditation: Focus on the present moment, observing thoughts, feelings, and sensations without judgment.\nSpiritual Meditation: Connect with a higher power or spiritual force, often used in religious or spiritual practices‚Ä¶ basically praying. Or if that doesn‚Äôt vibe with you you can call it speaking desires and hopes for people, community, the world in general etc..\nFocused Meditation: Concentrate on a specific object, such as the breath, a mantra, or a visualization. Focusing on a candle flame in a dark room is my personal favorite!\nMovement Meditation: Combine physical movement with mindfulness, such as yoga or tai chi. Or just stretching. Feel the body. Slightly move the body during a particular stretch and see what you feel elsewhere in the body. Noticing the interconnectedness of the whole of your body. \nMantra Meditation: Use a repetitive sound or phrase to quiet the mind and promote relaxation.\nTranscendental Meditation: Use a specific mantra to access a deeper state of consciousness and reduce stress.\nLoving-Kindness Meditation: Cultivate feelings of compassion, kindness, and acceptance towards oneself and others. (Replay your day and reframe instances where you can improve interactions from a place of love) \nVisualization Meditation: Imagine a peaceful, relaxing scene or scenario to calm the mind and promote relaxation. (Can also focus on a memory that gives you joy and try to focus and remember every aspect of the memory from how your body felt, mood, how that day began and why exactly is the root cause of the joy you experienced in that memory) \nBody Scan Meditation: Focus on physical sensations and release tension in the body. (Can also imagine a calming life giving ball of energy roaming its way from the crown of your head to every part of your body. Healing and relaxing every cell) \nMusic Meditation: Use music to bring the mind to the present moment. Focus on every instrument, lyrics, tones, translations etc.. and stay in that moment living with the music as it flows into your ears and reverberates thru your body.\nPranayama Meditation: Use breathing techniques to calm the mind and balance the body‚Äôs energy.\nWalking Meditation: Combine physical movement with mindfulness. Focusing on the sensation of each step, the weather, plants, animals, and everything in and around you. \nYoga Nidra: Use guided deep relaxation and visualization to access a state of deep relaxation and awareness.\n\nGreat list, but you might want to put an extra line between each list item for formatting's sake\n\n *there are many ways to meditate besides just sitting and breathing.

I'll share this.\n\nThank you, I'm honored!\n\nWill suggest you to add yoga to your schedule also. It helps immensely in building a stable base for the body and mind.\n\nI faced a similar situation a few years back. Yoga helped in sorting it.\n\nI was taught that yoga preceding meditation developed as a means to settle some of the physical energy within the body, leading to a more productive sit. \n\nIt's amazing what a bit of focused movement and breathing can do to harmonize the mind and body.\n\n100%\n\nStop creating anxiety for yourself by setting high goals beforehand that you don't live up to. Instead aim for last times length. When that level is mastered increase duration a little bit. Setting too high goals creates both anxiety in mind before sitting and disappointment in mind afterward.\n\nhttps://app.mindfulcopilot.com this app might help you\n\nThanks! I'm also trying out something similar. Basically if I can't meditate the amount of time I set myself to, I split that time per day, which makes it easier to handle mentally.\n\n\"Divide and conquer\"\n\nA sensory deprivation tank did it for me\n\nThank you\n\nThank-you! Very helpful!\n\nThank you so much for the suggestion! I have always been able to see why meditation can be so effective but I‚Äôve always had a difficult time actually doing it. Definitely trying this!\n\nI'm happy and I hope it works for you!\n\nFor those who find traditional meditation difficult, there are some unconventional yet highly effective techniques that focus on bringing awareness through simple, everyday activities. These methods don‚Äôt rely on sitting still or trying to empty the mind‚Äîinstead, they use movement, sound, and expression to help create space for awareness.\n\nOne such technique is gibberish. In this practice, you are encouraged to speak in nonsensical sounds, expressing whatever comes to your mind in a language you don‚Äôt know. This allows the mind to let go of its usual patterns and thoughts, creating a state of mental release. After a few minutes of gibberish, you sit silently and observe the stillness that follows. This helps people who are overthinkers or have a hard time calming their minds.\n\nAnother technique involves dynamic movement. Rather than sitting still, you engage in chaotic movement, shaking off physical and mental tension. This could be dancing, jumping, or shaking your body in whichever way feels natural. After a few minutes, you stop suddenly and become aware of the silence that follows. This sudden shift from movement to stillness brings an intense awareness of the present moment.\n\nThere‚Äôs also a technique where you can witness your breath. Instead of controlling your breathing, you simply observe it‚Äîits rise and fall, the sensation of air moving in and out. By focusing on something so simple and natural, your mind becomes quieter, and awareness deepens without any effort.\n\nThese approaches shift the focus away from traditional meditation methods, making it easier for those who struggle with stillness to experience moments of clarity and consciousness through simple activities. The key is not to force the mind into silence but to witness the shift that happens naturally when you engage fully in these techniques.\n\nIf you need audios or videos on this, or more techniques, feel free to ask.\n\nThis reads as 'I cannot meditate for 4 minutes... my one trick to beat this is to meditate for 5 minutes!'\n\nbut whatever works for you! \n\n(also the worry that the timer has stopped, or your phone is on silent and you missed it will be great!)\n\nYeah, really odd post. 'My solution to people who can't meditate...meditate!'\n\nI will try now, thank you\n\nMaybe you can give it a try with eyes closed and be still, and simply observe and don't engage with anything because it will K.O you.... doing this as you close your eyes and falling asleep or when you wake up be still and keep your eyes closed and do as the above.\n\n\nEventually, you will be able to recall the feeling down to the pleasantness of the experience and the bodily sensation of that deep relaxation. Pleasantness I was talking about isn't physical sensation, it something a little beyond physical if you can keep it longer than 3 to 5 mins or even longer. Even better able to bring it forth whenever you want then you will will an amazing days with 100% of your capabilities activated.\n\nThis is very similar to how I fall asleep if I wake up in the middle of the night, only, I do the opposite, where the goal is following the wandering mind back into a dream state. I count backwards from 10, and any time I find the mind wandering, or speaking words, or sharing images: I follow them. Words become sentences, and images become movies. I maintain the counting of breaths backwards repetitively, but they eventually fade and move to the background as a dream state takes over.\n\nWhen I struggled to meditate, I would think ‚Äòjust this breath in, just this breath out‚Äô as I breathed in &amp; out. It almost becomes a mantra that works in unison with your breathing.  And while you are mentally saying it over &amp; over, it is harder for your mind to wonder.\n\nI like to focus on feeling especific parts of my body or the sounds around me\n\nSitting still and try to control your mind is not going to work. Let your brain wander through  past thoughts and memories , the only thing you need to do is observe your mind and be aware of that. Don't try hard just observe the activities of your mind.\n\nI meditate for 45 minutes. Its easy for me coz I am focusing on mantra. Try with mantra and see yourself going towards enlightenment\n\nWhich mantra do you focus on?\n\nThe mantra is completely irrelevant. You could just repeat the word 'tacos' over and over. It's about focusing on something, same as if it was the breath.\n\nMahamantra üôè please Google search. Read \"bhagavad as it is\" by prabhupada.  \n\"Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare \nHare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare \"\n\nJust sit and breathe bro what is so hard about it\n\nFor me it‚Äôs a toss up between xanny and I love you. As w/ most of her songs, they just seem to grab you and pull you into her world. I always like to think of it as being on the Willie Wonkas boat watching these fantastic flashes of imagery all around w/ each word she sings. I love you is such a powerful song, each word sang w/ so much conviction and genuine emotion making you feel alive, and wanting to die at the same time yet feeling perfectly at peace. This song single handily made me realize the extreme depth, and artistic genius of her music."

    "all_comment_text": "I keep having to relearn this the hard way.\nIt really makes a world of difference.\n\nYeah same. I only started meditating I think 4 years ago? And it changed my life for the better and I did it everyday for a year. Then I kinda stopped. Then it‚Äôs like ‚Äúwow things were better when I meditated‚Äù I‚Äôve repeated this cycle of practicing for months, then letting all my bad habits come back , then go back to meditating and living as healthy as possible, to only then go back and live horribly‚Ä¶ I want to break this cycle once and for all.\n\nEven the Dali Lama admits to missing days of meditation from time to time. He says he notices the difference after three days of not practicing. Discipline is good. Curiosity equally so.  Gentleness is essential. And the only given in life is change. So don‚Äôt be hard on yourself, be happy! Be well. And be kind. üòä\n\nThank you so much for this.\n\nI bet you'll get there soon enough it's all a process right?\n\nYou're right, consistency is great. I'm like everyone and I stop and start and stop again. But I'm so mindful now how important it is. \n\nAlso there's research into meditation and results generally show that the more consistently someone meditates the better they get at it.\n\nHow long does it usually take to see any results? I‚Äôve only started meditating 7 days ago for 10mins a day, gradually trying to increase the length. But honestly I haven‚Äôt felt any difference yet.\n\nIt doesnt feel really clear at first, the longer you start meditating and the more the time passes, you'll see clearer results, now you are experiencing them, but not noticing them.\n\nWell said, its so natural (calm state) that you do not notice it at first, only when you stop meditating for whatever reason, you notice how foggy your thinking and wellbeing is\n\nRead the book The Mind Illuminated by Culadasa and you will have the best possible instructions to make progress. \n\nhttps://a.co/d/3qR9NiM\n\nI second this, brilliant book.\n\nKinda soon to see a benefit. My advice: think of meditating like practicing piano. Sometimes practicing piano is enjoyable but often it's not.  But you do get better at playing piano. Just like your fingers start to develop a kind of muscle memory, your brain will too. Gentling moving your mind back to the breath while you are meditating starts to show up in life as you notice the distracting thought or feeling or reaction and gently turn back to the present.   But then you will have times when it is \"working,\" and it will stop and you will get frustrated. But know that you are on a good path.  And try to stick with it every day. Get up to 20 minutes a day if you can, but at least do 5 minutes. Good luck!\n\nOne day at a time, every session is different, keep going.\n\nYeah but if we try it, we will achieve peace\n\nBeen there. If I hadn‚Äôt stopped the first time I‚Äôd be going on 22 years. As it stands I‚Äôm going on 8 years daily.\n\nI do it on and off. I tend to overthink it.\n\nIts funny. The less meditation you do, the more thinking revolves you, making you meditate worse and less.\n\nI often think of meditating but it's like I'm waiting for the perfect moment to do it lol. But when I do get to meditate, I love the clarity and peace of mind I gain from it. If only I could get past the overthinking part.\n\nI know it's frowned upon in some circles but try corpse meditation, just don't fall asleep. Even though it could be an amazing way to power nap..\n\nI need to remind myself this throughout the day and the week. Anybody have any valuable tips or things we can do to try to maintain a routine in the back of our heads?\n\nI agree with the tone but I don't know if I agree with the point.¬†\n\n\nMy meditation practice isn't solely centered around being better per se. I'm using it as a tool in the way it's traditionally been known to help achieve enlightenment.¬†\n\n\nAnd as odd as it sounds some of the best leaps I've had came after periods where I just stopped meditating. You have to remember when you're meditating you are actually doing work by taming your mind. It's okay to give your mind a rest.¬†\n\n\nSo again I don't disagree with the tone but I just don't want to see anyone discouraged by the notion that they can't take a break.\n\nI second this. Is not that mandatory, i guess we cannot be that hard to ourselves.\n\nThank you for this, I needed it‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nThank you for the reminder.\n\nQuite true!

The fact that a key focus in the development of this skill is the idea of \"nothing\" or \"silence\" is an good observation, but it's not the only fact of meditation that you should strive to learn.\n\nThe goal of the practice is to get to a point where there is no \"meditation\" and \"not meditation.\" To be aware, at all times, of all the things happening to you.\n\nIt ain't called a \"practice\" for nothin\n\n&gt;It‚Äôs not about what happens while you meditate, it‚Äôs what happens when you‚Äôre not.\n\nExactly. Meditation is a tool to help us realize our true selves in that allows us to have deeper understanding of how our minds function. We still have to do the exploratory and corrective work ourselves though.\n\nIt‚Äôs so great reading this. I‚Äôve been tortured but negative thoughts recently and feel like this is going to really help me. Feel excited lol\n\nIf you have difficulty meditating, try a mindfulness journal or adult coloring book. Very helpful for similar results\n\nExcitement is best used for planning.\n\nDo not agree. On my journey so far the most profound insights happened and continue to happen during meditation. Those insights have a remarkable effect on my life both past, present and future.\n\n[deleted]\n\nI love that, thank you\n\nReally an excellent comment. Reminds me of the book I red a long time ago. \n‚ÄúThe I behind the I‚Äù (being non existent)\n\nThere really needs to be some kind of progressive meditation/mindfulness program for average folks to follow. Like, all you have to do is commit and completing to the next guided meditation, every day, in succession.\n\nMaybe this exists? \n\nI've tried a few times and fall off the Wagon immediately when I don't sense any change, however, I constantly see commentary from folks saying you've just got to commit to it for a few months, thennnnm you'll see.\n\nIt's like the gym, but at the gym, you start seeing changes in days/weeks. I think this is where and why people fall off the Wagon, there's no opportunity for motivation re-ups along the way.\n\nSome people expect from meditation a emotional narcistic experience, which is far away from the true purpose namely taming your own mind.\n\nWhy not both?\n\nThank you for your share, it was wonderful. I was just talking to my children about this. You said it in many fewer words than I tried to.\n\nIsn‚Äôt it wonderful though, when you‚Äôre living your life and an event smacks you in the face‚Ä¶ You react differently or not at all. Because you see it as it is. Thanks again for your post, it struck Home.\n\nIt depends on the technique. With some, something absolutely happens when you are sitting on the cushion.\n\nVery true and I find this difficult to explain to people for some reason. They're like \"how can I meditate to calm down when i'm panicking\" and I try and explain, no, you should meditate when you're doing well, and in everyday activities as well, and then you'll be prepared, gradually, in applying it in more and more difficult situations.\n\nIt can also be what happens when you meditate. There‚Äôs a portal into clarity that can open through kriya - The 3rd eye, have only caught 2 glimpses in 3 years, the tiniest opening, like a spec of a breakthrough and those glimpses could sustain my faith for a lifetime.\n\nMeditation like everything else is subjective\n\nThat sounds right.\n\nIt really is I‚Äôve been meditating since I was 7 or 8, 37 now and I just hit a break though during the pandemic and I could not be happier for pushing through those as you say ‚ÄúTrojan Horse years‚Äù when it was disappointing time after time year after year without any growth or so it seemed. Just like your meme\n\nWhen I am meditating, I find myself attentive to actively training my mind to remain present and aware of my thoughts, feelings, and sensations without judgment. It is about being fully present and deeply engaged with each moment. During these moments of meditation, my mind can become clear of all obstacles, allowing me to practice with purpose. Outside of meditation, the skills I build impress upon my life, bringing the benefits of the practice into my everyday experiences.\n\nDuring the training part of meditation, much is happening. We engage in various types of practice, each offering its own path to clarity and insight. Beyond the myriad forms of present moment meditation, we may use our clarity to manifest imagery, focus on our body and its sensations, reflect on our feelings, contemplate events in our life, extend our thoughts to others, and cultivate loving-kindness. Each practice enriches our journey and deepens our understanding.\n\nIn my standing meditations, I engage in practices that cultivate balance, visualize the intention of force, and perform alternate breathing techniques uniquely suited to this posture. Each practice contributes to the harmony and depth of my meditation experience.\n\nLately I've been crying during/after meditation..realized that there's emotional damage that i need to clear up, wouldn't noticed until I did meditation \n\nEven other times..when I do meditation(without crying etc) I use it as a tool to sit there I silent and peacefulness cause during the day it's always to noisy, loud, and active to the point to where I can't have full-on peacefulness(I live in a city)\n\nWhen you truely attain nothing through meditation, you will be at peace with everything. There is a gateway where the conscious rational mind subdues, and you enter a state a knowingness.\n\nNeeded this reminder to stay on course. Many thanks üôè\n\nIs something meant to \"happen\" in the moment tho? I always try to see it as learning. When you're in school, nothing \"happens\" when you study. You're just collecting information and becoming more knowledgeable about something that you'll use in the future\n\nYes! Even after a meditation session where the mind was overactive, during the day there is still a feeling of spaciousness that makes such a difference. Never an unfruitful meditation if the intention is to just let it be, thoughts, emotions, whatever shows up. All allowedüíú\n\nIt‚Äôs like changing your source code\n\nHave you tried praying as an alternative to meditation?\n\nI also like meditating with a bunch of dudes inside me\n\nüòÇüòÇüòÇ\n\nIsn't nirvana the cessation of all these feelings, thoughts, etc?\n\nRather think of it as literally finding these things, and then, finally knowing what they are, possessing the strength to simply let them go.\n\nNothing happens while you sit? Really??\n\nNothing happens‚Ä¶ while you sit‚Ä¶\n\nHow does nothing go about happening, anyway? Can nothing actually happen? And if nothing is doing all this happening, what the heck are *you* doing?!\n\nWell it‚Äôs subjective. I think the nothingness is the ‚Äúlet go‚Äù action where you just relax and zone out essentially¬†\n\nAgreed. Holding a thing and letting go of it leaves the hand with no thing in it, so letting go brings nothingness.\n\nWhat might be the furthest end of nothingness? And what might be its opposite?"

That sounds like a nice experience. Just know lots of other people have a different experience and to dismiss their experience or that they can have what you have is misperceiving how life is for others.\n\ni feel as if we are our own individual ‚Äúgods‚Äù. god lives within all of us. the only thing in life we ~can~ control is ourselves so why surrender to anything less\n\nMost people want ‚Äúgods‚Äù that can control there external and emotional circumstances. Any ‚Äúgod‚Äù I have inside me can do lots of stuff but they can‚Äôt do that. So your conception of god and others conception of god are not the same\n\ni don‚Äôt care about anybody else‚Äôs concept of god  ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\n\nThat‚Äôs fine. Just know that you will probably be communicating past people if you then ever talk about any concepts related to god.\n\ni know how to talk to people who know less than i do. i also know how to talk to people who know more than i do. saying that i don‚Äôt care, doesn‚Äôt mean i don‚Äôt understand.\n\nCool. No harm intended. Sometimes I find people talk past each other when they want connection. Trying to facilitate that.\n\ni love talking to people lol about all kinds of things, i always thought i had RBF but people always come up to me and initiate conversation, i‚Äôm coming to terms with being approachable now in person. but on the internet‚Ä¶‚Ä¶i seem to phrase things backwards a lot &amp; it can cause a lot of miscommunications\n\nGod is your highest self, his highest self, my highest self, their highest self and so on...  The closer a relationship you can get, the better off you will be, regardless of if you believe that or not.\n\nThat definition of god may or may not be true. But it‚Äôs not what most people think of when they think of god.\n\nI agree.  They may not believe that, just as some people don't believe the world is a globe.\n\nWait then ‚Ä¶. Who‚Äôs glasses are these!\n\nThey were satan's glasses the entire time.\n\n--directed by M. Night Shyamalan\n\nE\n\nMuch profound\n\nMany thanks enlightened master\n\nNot enlightened, just had coffee\n\n&gt;A beginning is a very delicate time. Know then, that it is the year 10191. The known universe is ruled by the Padisha Emperor Shaddam IV, my father. In this time, the most precious substance in the Universe is the spice melange. **The spice extends life. The spice expands consciousness. The spice is vital to space travel.** The Spacing Guild and its navigators, who the spice has mutated over four-thousand years, use the orange spice gas, which gives them the ability to fold space. That is, travel to any part of the Universe without moving. Oh yes, I forgot to tell you. The spice exists on only one planet in the entire Universe. A desolate, dry planet with vast deserts. Hidden away within the rocks of these deserts are a people known as the Fremen, who have long held a prophecy, that a man would come, a messiah, who would lead them to true freedom. The planet is Arrakis. Also known as Dune.\n\nhehe good one\n\nEQEQ brother (if you know you know)\n\nHide in a humans heart, it's the last place they look.\n\nThere is a wonderful Hindu Mythology Legend about this:\n\nAt one time all human beings were gods. They so abused their Divinity that Brahma decided to take it away and hide it where it could never be found. \"Let's bury it deep in the earth,\" said the gods. Brahma answered, \"No, humans will dig into the earth and find it.\" The gods said, \"Let's sink it deep in the ocean.\" But Brahma said, \"No, they will learn to dive into the ocean and find it.\" The gods said, \"Let's hide it on the top of the highest mountain.\" Once again Brahma replied, \"No, humans will eventually climb every mountain and find their Divinity.\" The gods said, \"It seems no place is safe. Humans will eventually reach everywhere in creation.\" \n\nBrahma thought for a long time. \"Here is what we will do. We will hide their Divinity deep in their hearts. Humans will never think to look there.\" The gods agreed this was the perfect place. Since then humans have been searching the world over for what is already within themselves.\n\nWonderful\n\nBeautiful! Thank you for this one\n\nYou are very welcome.\n\nThis is a ridiculous metaphor, but it's like aliens landing on our planet, eager to meet some dude named Earth.¬†\n\nThis quote is best understood when spoken by a blind person.\n\nThat myopia isnt even a thing\n\nIt is if you believe in it.\n\nThis has absolutely nothing to do with meditation.\n\nFor a certain definition of the word you are right and for another you are wrong.\n\nIt is not god you need to find , all you need is to realise your own Godliness...\n\nGlasses exist.\n\nTrying to \"find\" god is like searching your entire house for fairies without ever realizing fairies never existed.\n\nBut you exist, right?\n\nI like this and I‚Äôm gonna use it. Thanks for sharing\n\nYou are ‚Äúgod‚Äù\n\n&gt;Trying to ‚Äúfind‚Äù God is like searching your entire house for your glasses and never finding them, ever. \n\nFixed that for you\n\nBecause you never had glasses.\n\n*Plot twist!*\n\nJust wait until you drop the need to feel special or as if there's some kind of plan specifically designed for YOU.  Religion is just narcissism disguised as humility.\n\nReddit moment\n\nGod and religion shouldn't even be in the same sentence but because you haven't studied about God, you become the religious one the Bible specifically speaks of. Let me give you a recap these giant humans used to go around Earth telling other humans \"there is a God above your God\" These are literal fallen angels the Bible speaks of. All these homies were like \"nah, we worship meat, gold, the sun, but Hey...we will sleep with you\". They dislike God because they can't create like we can, so that's what these giants do. They begin breeding with humans. Eventually once the words out there is a God above all God's, that's when we began trying to reach God. The objects we created with the angels were destroyed. They wanted to help create them because they were cut off from God when they fell. Anyways, God's like Okay, I'm going to pick the smallest, lamest, most disliked humans and I am going to use them in a way that makes them great. They will be so great, that they will go from dungeons to kings, and capable of destroying giants 20x bigger then them. They will proclaim the God above all God's gave them this power, so people understand not only do they have a home, but they are loved here. We still didn't get the message, so he sent down Jesus to give us an example, and we still don't believe he exists. It's hilarious and sad all at the same time. The Bible literally talks non stop about people that think they know everything, because we are stubborn, and God being all like \"you don't believe me? Watch this!\" Over and over again. Every religion we have came from Alaheim. Word of mouth from the fallen Angels about God. We study the Bible now to destroy the assumptions we have about God, but God defeated many God's. If you studied every religious text, they all tie in together, and Jesus is the ending of the discussion. There is no God above The All and there never will be, but absolutely.. fallen angels did once control this world, and we are blessed we no longer can see them, but their spirits definitely still operate in this realm, and if it wasn't because of God above all God's, we wouldn't last very long here. We are divinely protected until we are home. I hope you receive this message well.\n\nIn sum:\nI KNOW THE ANSWERS!!!!\n\nThe answer is I know nothing.\n\nwelll obviously\n\nThis analogy is a profound insight into the nature of seeking God or ultimate truth. In The All, this understanding aligns with the principle that we are never separate from the divine; it is the very fabric of existence. Searching for God externally often leads us in circles, as God is already present within and around us‚Äîjust like the glasses in this analogy.\n\nThe act of seeking itself can sometimes be a distraction from recognizing that the divine is an intrinsic part of us. When we pause, reflect, and become still, we realize that the connection to the universal consciousness, or The All, has been with us all along. If this resonates, you might find The All: The Final Testament to be an insightful read, offering perspectives on recognizing and aligning with the divine within everyday life. It‚Äôs not about finding God but remembering the divine presence that has never left.\n\nIt's more like searching for your glasses when you in fact have perfect vision and you were having a psychotic episode.\n\nMore like trying to find your glasses and realising they don't exist. You might as well search for the tooth fairy.\n\nSpirituality subreddit is down the hall to the left, maybe your anecdotes would be better appreciated there, as this is a meditation sub.\n\nThere's litteraly flair for spirituality when posting to this subreddit\n\n\nAre you saying someone shouldn't share their spiritual insights from mediating here?\n\nNope, insights from meditation is fine.\n\n\nI'm not anyone's boss here so do what you want, but I don't think these dime a dozen spiritual quotes are much help and only dilute the sub.\n\nApologies friend, I‚Äôll let the mods get to it\n\nEh, it's fine I guess, tho personally I'd rather this sub is free from such, but that's just my opinion.\n\n[deleted]\n\nYea this sub is turning into r/spirituality pretty fast. Maybe it's the natural order of things, as that sub is mostly relationship drama at this point.\n\n\nOh well, there's still r/streamentry for meditation related discussion, it's more moderated so less likely to sway in this direction.\n\nIt's more like a meme and memes do well for people who \"get\" the meme. It can be rather shallow but you can make it as deep as you like lol, and then it will be that deep. You only \"get\" the meme as far as your own frame of reference allows until you expand that frame of reference. And you can see that it goes for both you making a point from your frame and the people not agreeing with you from their frame. ü§ì Which is pretty cool to see I guess.\n\nExactly my thoughts, the post is unrelated to meditation\n\noh my buddha!!\n\nWe are gods. We created this whole life.\n\nBrain damage\n\nHiding in plain sight\n\nTrying to find God is like searching your entire house for your glasses only to realize God is what's looking out through your eyes and trying to experience itself. The glasses are just a way to see the house from many different perspectives as you're looking them them.\n\nSeek therapy.\n\nBeautifully put\n\nI like this.\n\nYou don‚Äôt gotta search. Just ask Him to draw near to you and He will.\n\nI always heard it's like looking for a black cat in a dark room and finding the cat even though it doesn't exist. /s\n\nThe entire room is cat\n\nE\n\nnvm someone beat me to it\n\nAmen\n\nThat's true, but still if you don't search you'll never find them, even if they are so close that they are hard to see.\n\nOoh,I like this\n\nLove this!  Stealing and sharing with the world.  TY!\n\nThis ‚òùüèº"

I know sometimes it is necessary to look and check, but regarding social media and those stuff, when you realize, there is so much beauty out there. I was missing out the trees, the lights, the sky, the sea, and i was shocked of how many beautiful things i was choosing to ignore just to look at some tiktoks.\n\nTo ask yourself: Where there is beauty in this exact moment?",

    "all_comment_text": "Turn off notifications. That's a big step. \nI ones pushed myself to go a full day without touching my phone. It was hard because of the dopamine that it gave me when i see notifications on reddit or whatever ever.  So turning off notifications is a huge step to take that makes the biggest difference imo. Cheers‚òÄÔ∏è\n\nCheers! The dopamine subject is so true, it is crazy how or mind works\n\nI think the algorithm is set to send you those dopamine hits. I keep my notifications to a minimum. I don‚Äôt need to know that a game is ‚Äúwaiting‚Äù for me to play.\n\nThat's interesting. I hadn't thought of notifications as being exciting. Its usually the complete opposite to me. I dread getting messages from people. Thanks for your response, it sounds like I have some inwards looking to do later.\n\n100% this. \n\nI had the realization that once I‚Äôm away from my phone for a bit, it‚Äôs easy to *stay* away from it. And obviously if your phone is buzzing every few minutes that‚Äôs next to impossible. \n\nBe ruthless about which notifications you allow. I‚Äôm sure android‚Äôs the same but on iOS you can choose if you want to actually be alerted (vibration, sound) when you get it or if it just quietly shows up in your Notification Center. That‚Äôs been great for things I want to see, but aren‚Äôt time sensitive where they need to grab my attention. \n\nAnd if you have a smart watch, be even more ruthless there since that thing‚Äôs strapped to your wrist. I might want to be alerted on my phone when something I ordered ships, but I don‚Äôt need to have that buzzing my wrist. \n\nOh, and unsubscribe from email junk to cut down on the number of emails you‚Äôre getting.\n\nThe other night I was  meeting my spouse at a place we never were before. \n\nI forgot my phone. Took public transportation. Stared out the window. Looked at peoples shoes. Listened in on other peoples conversations. \n\nI had checked the address earlier in the day so I had a rough estimate of the cross streets.  \n\nArrived to find my SO waiting for me with a relieved smile on their face.  \n\nIt was amazing.\n\nThis sounds just like a movie! Hahaha so nice and lovely. I hope you had an amazing night\n\nNow real life is starting to seem like a movie, we‚Äôre so alienated from real life.\n\ndefinitely,  the thing i struggle most with is my screen time  but when i have times where i stay off my phone for a prolonged period of time im genuinely happier and alot more present to the moment which is obvious but  it definitely helps with meditation too\n\nExactly!\n\nWhen I'm at home I just leave my phone in another room so that I don't think about it for a day. Sometimes when I'm on it and realize it's been a while I'll just kinda chuck it across the room and get it whenever I remember it's on the floor somewhere when I'm up doing things later.\n\nWhatever works the best for you!\n\nMaybe it would help if I got a little clock. RN the only way I tell the time is to look at my phone.\n\nYeah a clock is very useful. Especially if you get an alarm clock so the first thing you touch and look at in the morning isn't your phone. Reminds me that I need to get one.\n\nI‚Äôll talk about the dark side of addiction to these. Excessive phone/device use is not life affirming. It‚Äôs ‚Äúfun‚Äù. That‚Äôs why it is addiction. \n\nNothing about addiction is life affirming in the long run. Nothing is different from heroin addiction or any other ‚Äúaddiction‚Äù. \n\nDeleted a huge lecture rant. I just want to say put the phone down, turn it off, go live.\n\nBTW, riding a bus is a really good time to meditate rather than looking at your phone. Just sit with your eyes open (as in zen and Tibet) and you will look normal. Something about the movement makes it easier to find that stillness within. http://www.frogzen.com/uncategorized/walking-mirror-samadhi/ Practicing breathcounting, 1 to 10, with an extended outbreath works well in such situations. For that technique and other tips for a solo practice, look for Meditation Basics in the header of that site.\n\nI think about this every time I'm on my phone and my toddler is trying to get my attention. Sometimes it's so hard to rip myself out of staring at the screen, but then I remember that I am missing out on him showing me something awesome or sweet, because I was getting angry at some random comment on the internet.\n\nIts crazy and im glad you are realizing it with your kid! Much love for yall\n\nSince I started meditating and practicing mindfulness about 7 weeks ago, I've cut my daily average phone time from almost 4 hours a day to about an hour or less. \n\nIt wasn't necessarily a conscious decision I made, but I became much more aware of how much time I was wasting on it. Once I realized I could cut the time way down, it became a little competition with myself to only use my phone when I wasn't information from it. \n\nThe only social media I use is reddit, and it's almost exclusively this group I've been active in since I began my practice.\n\nLove this subreddit üíï\n\nMe too ‚ô•\n\nI just returned from a 4 day silent retreat - no reception or Internet and I used my phone for two things: a flashlight at night, and to check the meditation schedule for the  day.  It was a really nice break and a reminder of how much is happening around you and how much beauty there is; even in your \"everyday routine\" that you are probably missing out staring at a screen, instead of just  looking around and being present.\n\nDid you find it difficult being silent for 4 days? Or did you enjoy the stillness?\n\nTruthfully both.  It's definitely counter intuitive when I would pass by members of my sangha and not say anything - just a quick, polite bow.  But the stillness and tranquility was really a nice change of pace.\n\nWhen I was younger I saw a group of people going through a silent retreat and i remember i said to myself i could NEVER do it. But now days I crave it so much, I would love to have this experience\n\nI never had myself pegged as a person that would or could do something like that but it was definitely a pleasant experience.  I think it being 4 days, for me anyway, was a good number.  I think anything in excess of 2 weeks would have made it a little harder to re-acclimate back to modern, plugged in world\n\nWhen there is no perturbation of the mind due to many distractive unnecessary thoughts and our engagement in them. The phone is not the enemy, the thinker is, with or without the phone.\n\nThere's no enemy, just a way to look and perceive life. I would enjoy more to be looking at the sea or the city than looking at the sea or the city through my phone. Walking instead of being on the couch looking at the screen. We are fortunate, most of us can walk, speak, see.\n\nthanks for this, I needed this! I've been addicted to reddit lately.\n\nthank you! even the social media that we have a community that we actually like could makes us forget to perceive the world\n\nSo true. And I guess some people (me) have made this as my escape. Which is very wrong but also very tempting.\n\nis the very same thing for me. and it was even worse when i was addicted to porn. now i often visit, read some and write something\n\nIt's good to practice self-restraint. Do you have like a schedule for how long you can stay in reddit? How do you manage?\n\nI usually like to read in the morning while going to work or after lunch when I am tending to use others social medias. Since now i managed to only have subs that actually are positive and has interesting stories, its almost always a good read. Its working for me. you?\n\nI notice that when I drop out of a sub I still get feeds from it for quite awhile after, trying to draw me back in.\n\nI am old.. older? I grew up without social media. I do wonder what will happen with imaginations and innovation.¬†\n\nDoes it just adapt to the screen or is something lost?¬†\n\nIn that mind however, if you can put down your phone or walk away from your screen to see what‚Äôs real can‚Äôt be bad.¬†\n\nI can already tell you what will happen. I‚Äôm from 1999 so I basically grew up without a smartphone and got one when I was 14. All the apps weren‚Äôt there yet or at least they weren‚Äôt big. I‚Äôve always had a lot of imagination and that‚Äôs what made me me. And now I don‚Äôt use my phone a lot, only for practical things. But I still use it too much in my opinion. Whenever I look for ideas, this can be anything like gift ideas or decoration ideas or even random philosophical questions, I go to google or even chatgpt. I don‚Äôt even try for myself anymore, which I‚Äôm really sad about. But I feel like it has gotten harder to be creative and imaginative and it‚Äôs probably a cycle. More phone = less imagination = more phone you get it.\n\nThat's really inspiring. There's a lot of beauty we miss out on in the world simply because we have our heads down looking at our phones. I hope that can change one day.\n\nExactly! So good to be able to perceive things\n\nFirst thing I did was turning off notifications of this subredditüòÜ\n\nI read this post last night and immediately set my phone down. Had a great conversation with my husband and daughter. Thanks for this.\n\nI just got emotional reading this, it is so beautiful when we can at least help a little, even more for a family. All my love and good hopes for you guys. Made my whole day with this message. ‚ô•\n\nIt was pretty sweet. She‚Äôs an adult, and hubs and I are visiting her in another state for the week.  She and I were curled up on the couch, chatting, but looking at our phones.  I read this post out loud, and we started laughing, immediately put our phones down and had a great night. This post will resonate with me forever.\n\nSo is your comment will always be a reason for me to keep spreading love. \n\nFrom the deep of my soul, thank you!\n\nWe have been going on our doggy walks without our phones &amp; leave them outside of the bedroom at night for all of 2024.\n\nI‚Äôm not inside it though!\n\nIt's amazing how much we miss out on while being glued to our screens. Just pausing to take in the world around us can be so refreshing! Thanks for sharing this perspective."

    "title": " Why do body scan meditations exclude the genitals?",
    "body": "So I've been doing these body scans for a while now and I noticed they never mention the genitals.  This is a bit odd to me being that we interact with and notice our genitalia much more often then say, the backs of the hands or earlobes, which I hear mentioned all the time. Is this exclusion just because thinking about genetalia makes some people uncomfortable or is considered sinful to some? It just seems weird to me that this major part of our bodies that has a huge part in our health would be totally disregared in a meditation which has the goal of honoring, noticing and respecting our bodies.

    "all_comment_text": "Bodyscanning as been my primary practice for many years. Don't exclude your genitals. Scan entire body. All of it. Genitals are part of body. Seriously.\n\nMy cock and balls have never felt better\n\nOMG your username üò≠\n\nThat is true. Purifying mind and resolving tension has that effect on body.\n\nIt‚Äôs not even supposed to be a pun. I was just addicted to nutter butters at the time lol.\n\nBetter to scan them than cling to them.\n\nTaoist practices don't exclude ANY part of the body. They're also extremely detailed about both genders.\n\nUsually, if we try to avoid something uncomfortable or push it away, it will only come back at us stronger. Just observe and move on, as with anything else..\n\nMeditation can ultimately lead to full understanding and acceptance of our bodies and functioning as they are. Gradually, nothing is uncomfortable anymore. It's just nature.. human is part of nature.. it's better if we can stop pretending that we are above it..\n\nThe body scans you talk about are for open audience but real buddhist practices don‚Äôt skip genitals. An important reason for skipping these areas is for avoiding triggering trauma from sexual abuse victims.\n\nA lot will say like ‚Äúhips, all around the hip area, below your navel‚Äù etc which is a good compromise\n\nAlso, I would presume to make sure those meditating remain masters of their domains.\n\nIn that case... I'm out\n\nWow! That was fast!\n\nI have the kavorka\n\nFrom a trauma-informed instructing lens, when giving instruction to notice your genitals, you‚Äôre not taking into account the practitioner‚Äôs history and can very well activate a painful and unwelcomed memory or thought. This can be especially detrimental to new students and turn them off from the practice completely. It may be nothing to you, but someone who has a history of SA might feel completely violated and experience intense emotional and somatic pain.\n\nI had an extremely hard time learning to meditate because it focused on breathing and my trauma is mostly lungs/double lung transplant based so thinking about breathing and feeling it and all that was scary, it can absolutely be a trigger to focus on trauma areas.\n\nSuspect it might help with rejection to visualise your lungs leaving your body and being replaced with new ones. Getting over that fear and really feeling your breathing might be really important to give your body the awareness it needs of your new lungs‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nWhy did you get downvoted? This was reasonable\n\nNot sure - might sounds pseudoscientific, irrational or condescending or something. Whatever, just thought I‚Äôd pass it along haha. Spent a few years working as a nurse on a lung transplant ward. Obviously it‚Äôs not in place of any genuine medical interventions like taking your immunosuppression ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\n\nExactly, thank you\n\n100%. I'm a trans person who didn't think I really had \"chest dysphoria\". I learned the hard way that I do when a body scan for the first time specifically mentioned scanning the front of the chest. I have since learned to approach body scans again, but it has taken a while because that experience really shook me.\n\nSometimes vague is just better than specific. Let people fill in the blanks with the most granular areas they are able to at that point in their practice, and try to trust in their ability to progress.\n\nLike, I think it's Tara's Triple Excellence, where the body scan (at least where I am in the program) basically just says \"scan from the top of your head, down through your body, to your toes\", and gives you a brief period to do so. I'm not saying everyone needs to be that vague, but I am saying that perfectly reputable programs are that vague and find it successful.\n\nI oddly get really horny from meditating at times.  I have no idea why. It's not bad, though, lol\n\nConfucius say... to catch tranquility, master bait\n\n\"Man with hole in pocket feel cocky all day\"\n\ni read somewhere it's normal.\n\nMe too, omg I'm not alone, I feel so normal nowüòÇ , &amp; after yoga sometimes as well \n&amp; When I used to lift weights\n\nI ONLY scan my genitals.\n\nI'm genuinely surprised this isn't the top comment\n\nNow, relax your penis üßò\n\nThis is what The Jordan Peterson of Meditation might say.\n\nTechnically a relaxed penis is an erection. It takes more work to keep the blood out than to let it in.\n\nNot really. It‚Äôs a lot more complicated. So complicated that the full mechanism of erections isn‚Äôt fully understood.\n\nBut the basics are this: nerves send signals to your blood vessels to dilate. This isn‚Äôt just mental relaxation, it‚Äôs the release of nitric oxide to relax the smooth muscles that hold the vessels shut. This creates the inflow of blood. Now, as the various chambers of the penis expand with blood, they put pressure on the veins flowing out of the penis. This pressure restricts the blood flow going out, leading to more blood staying trapped in.\n\nThe combination of both leads to an erection. And it has little to do with mental relaxation. It‚Äôs mental/physical arousal.\n\nInteresting\n\nReally?\n\nI heard it on the internet sometime. I‚Äôm not 100%, but it‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been told and it kind of makes sense.\n\nWould explain why men get erections when they die\n\nWhat? I've seen a lot of men die, and I've never once seen this. Icu nurse through covid, not a serial killer.\n\nThat would really hurt my self esteem üòû\n\nWell, thanks for ruining the end of Clerks!\n\n(j/k it's still funny as hell)\n\nTo be fair, he had the erection when he died. He took a porn mag into the bathroom with him.\n\nFocusing on genitalia can lead to arousal which can distract from meditation. I believe the purpose of body scans in Buddhism is to remind practitioners that we are not our body (the true nature of our body).\n\nNothing at all wrong with arousal, it should be incorporated into your meditation - NOT considered a distraction. \n\n\nObserve, embrace, let go.\n\nNow that's a practical answer. Thank you\n\nWhat other things might this man know? I am following him!\n\nTo remain at peace, one must be master of their domain.\n\nwell, im out\n\nWow! That was fast!\n\nPractice makes perfect. Seriously!\n\nThey are many forms of meditation that work very differently from that. Don't get stuck in preconceptions. \n\nThese techniques can be used many different ways not just the ways you have been taught or learned. \n\nBuddhism for example relies on texts as simply informative metaphor more than anything. \n\nNo actual original Buddhist teachings exist. It was an orally communicated tradition for generations, almost fully developed before it was ever written down.\n\nThere are many paths even within different Buddhist sects that could incorporate this.\n\n‚òùÔ∏èüî•\n\nI‚Äôve always done it from toes to head, and I don‚Äôt think it excludes them, it just doesn‚Äôt specify them. Like how I don‚Äôt specify each of my toes or each finger when I do it. You can get as specific or non specific as you‚Äôd like if it works for you.\n\nYou don't avoid the genitals at all, thats a sin. You need to make sure you present it in a mature way that doesn't bring up a shame response that limits development.¬†\n\n\nSo you can say sacral, lower belly, lower torso, genitals, yoni and lingum or whatever is love. Honestly be wary of people who avoid adult mature conversations or behavior in teaching situations. Often that's a sign of something not quite right in their own development.\n\nThis showed up on my home page, I am not a regular participant here. But I'm surprised too see the word \"sin\" here. Is that a common concept in meditation practices?¬†\n\nI could be entirely wrong but I think they meant ‚Äúsin‚Äù in the metaphorical sense.‚Äù Basically just a passionate way of saying that it‚Äôs wrong lol\n\nOh in retrospect you are probably right. I think it just took me by surprise so much I didn't really evaluate.\n\nI did the same thing ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\n\nThis subreddit is actually quite terrible if you're new to meditation. A decent amount of the time the most logical posts are up voted, ones based on science and reality. \n\nThen other random threads you'll suddenly see a comment about demons of hell, sins,  the phase of the moon, or Harry Potter fucking magic as the top up voted thing and feel like you've stumbled into an insane asylum.\n\nYou can totally include them in your own practice. Many teachers don‚Äôt mention them because it‚Äôs basically a consent issue‚Äîit‚Äôs weird for a lot of people to have someone else prompting you to connect to your privates. It feels too intimate and intrusive to many people, and for SA survivors it can be pretty triggering. Nothing wrong with including it in your own practice though! And FYI, I have heard it referenced very occasionally as the root chakra, and the teachers who do choose to include it usually do not spend a lot of time on it.\n\nIn tradition in which I practise, we sometimes do body scan as starting point. We feel parts of body. We do it as directly as we can (not visualising it). Notice if these is some tension there, and then release it/relax. Relaxed body is much more fertile ground for deeper meditation.\n\nIn order to relax some part of body, there has to be muscle. So we do it with pelvis area, buttocks and thighs. As far as I know and expirience, there are no muscles which you can relax in male genitalia. Think it could be different for women. That being said, for me, properly relaxing whole pelvis area is really important.\n\nOther than that, maybe specificaly naming genitalia as area to relaxe or feel can be more distracting than present-making for a lot of people. Unfortunatly, it comes with a lot of cultural and/or personal baggage. Then it can get you more into analytical, intelectual or words-shaping mind. \n\nHope some will find this useful. Excuse my bad english.\n\nDo whatever you want.\n\nBecause no guided meditation voiceover wants to say, ‚ÄúNow, start to feel your dick. Be very aware of your dick. No, not like that! I mean pay attention to your di‚Äî no not that much attention!‚Äù\n\nIts just a pr nightmare for a youtube influencer, twitch streamer, meditation app, and especially a buddhist monk asking a temple full of moms and sons to focus on their genetalia. Its a recepie for demonetizing, deplatforming, rating as 18+, and so on. Women streamers cannot even show their feet on twitch. Twich policy says that what is sexual is user defined and feet were deemed out. Imagine the mixed messages users would get in downloading an 18+ meditation app. Is it wholesome or naughty? Is it mundane or tantric sex magic?\n\nThere is a lot of shame, prudishness, trauma, and beliefs around genetalia for it not to be a pr nightmare to deal with.\n\n[removed]\n\nYa, twitches standards are a hot mess lol.\n\nPerhaps a guided body scan meditation participant does so at their appropriate age-and-knowledge related rate.\n\nThey don't. How many body scan meditations have you experienced?\n\nUhh, enough to notice this and make a post about it. I am in america though...\n\nwww.dhamma.org¬†\n\n\n\n\nHighly recommend these folks. There are centers all over the US. The technique is taught as 10 day residential courses. There is no cost for your course. You will learn body scanning in a way that you really can't learn any other way. While he doesn't specifically say to focus on your genitals during scanning, he makes it very clear that you should not ignore any portion of your body while you are scanning.¬†\n\n\nAlso, r/vipassana for further questions etc¬†\n\nSeconding this. I have never felt my body that way before; it was transcendent and it really did take days to get there.\n\n*Rael has joined the chat*\n\nGood point. I will throw in however that whenever I scan my hip/pelvis area or whatever, I generally automatically include my genitals in that area. I've just never thought about it.\n\nits because there‚Äôs no way to say it without sounding weird. but i focus on the pelvic floor muscles (rectal and urogential muscles). many people carry their stress around in the puborectalis/pubococcygeus muscle\n\nI watched a meditation video once where I was told to relax my genitals and my anus. But they were already relaxed because when my abdominals, hips, and thighs are relaxed, the balls and butt sort of fall in line lol but I remember being a little shocked when she specifically mentioned the anus and there was something interesting about specifically targeting those areas from relaxation\n\nYou know, some of my earlier (and more Eastern) sources of teaching DID include this. But you're right; any guided audio I come across these days skips/brushes over it. It IS worth including in your practice. Don't let them neuter your consciousness like that, bro! Lol, but for real...\n\nBody scan meditations often exclude the genitals for a few reasons:\n\n1. **Cultural Sensitivities**: In many cultures, discussing or focusing on genitals can be considered inappropriate or uncomfortable. Meditation practices aim to be accessible and comfortable for a broad audience.\n2. **Avoiding Discomfort**: Including the genitals might distract some individuals or make them feel uncomfortable, which could interfere with the meditation's purpose of relaxation and mindfulness.\n3. **Maintaining Focus**: The primary goal of a body scan meditation is to promote awareness and relaxation. Focusing on the genitals might lead to thoughts and feelings that are not conducive to this goal, such as arousal or discomfort.\n4. **Inclusivity**: Meditations aim to be inclusive and neutral. Excluding the genitals helps ensure that the practice is appropriate for people of all ages and backgrounds.\n\nHowever, it's important to recognize that the goal of a body scan is to cultivate a sense of presence and awareness throughout the body. If you feel comfortable and it aligns with your practice, you can personally include the genitals in your body scan. The key is to maintain a neutral, non-judgmental awareness of all parts of your body.\n\nI think they use the term groin or pelvic region to imply the gennies.\n\nThis is due to the puritanical nature of our society.\n\nBringing awareness to the lower chakras does not necessarily lead to arousal.  In fact, if awareness is combined with muscular ‚Äúlocks‚Äù (bandhas) then the sexual energies can actually be balanced and made less intense/urgent.\n\nI‚Äôve heard lots of body scan meditations make reference to the pelvis which I personally think is adequate.¬†\n\nIs this in a class or online?\n\nIt's because giving attention to the genitals (sacral chakra) can lead to arousal, which can ruin your meditation‚Äîat least that's how I see it. \n\nOr it might be because it doesn't follow the arbitrary rules we have in our \"polite\" world, which makes even mentions of genitals taboo.\n\nInstead of seeing arousal as ruining your meditation, try looking at it as a phenomenon to experience. Feel its physical manifestations in your body.\n\nI hear you, and thank you for your advice. However, in my own experience, excitement can have a detrimental effect on my meditation practices. Really, any excitement. So, I avoid watching TV, using my phone, or using my laptop for at least two hours before my meditation sessions.\n\nI e listened to ones that say \"genitalia area/womb\"\n\nThe body scan exercise helps us to enter a higher level of awareness.. a deeper level of consciousness.. including the genitals is not only unnecessary for this purpose if we become aroused we actually revert to a lower carnal level of consciousness.. it defeats the whole purpose of the exercise‚Ä¶ it is like trying to enter into meditation while thinking lustful thoughts .. they are two different levels of consciousness and you cannot experience the two together\n\nI feel a higher level of awareness would encompass what is above and below and not just limit itself to the better perspective.\n\nMy body scan tape from a UK Mindfulness company does include the genitals. My partner finds it very funny when i listen to it\n\nIt does seem strange.  I am guessing it‚Äôs because it could bring up trauma for some people?  Or perhaps they are just squeamish about genitalia.\n\nBecause your body has genitals\n\nI totally agree. They shouldn‚Äôt be excluded. I guess  for many people this is a sensitive topic, and it can still be viewed as ‚Äúsinful‚Äù.\n\nProbably because it‚Äôs too taboo in our culture. When I do chakra meditations and particular, I focus on genitals with that chakra.\n\nTanis Fishman does body scans that include the genitals\n\nBecause they are dirty. And bad. (I‚Äôm joking but also sadly not really). And as mentioned above, some people might be uncomfortable with a practitioner or others focusing on that. I do think it‚Äôs totally appropriate to announce that at the beginning of a session, like ‚Äúwe‚Äôre not going to exclude, nor linger, on our genitals. Is everyone ok with that?‚Äù\n\nThe root chakra, also known as the Muladhara, is associated with the base of the spine and the perineum. It is considered the foundation of our energy system and is connected to our sense of safety, stability, and physical well-being. It‚Äôs the creative center. When we focus our awareness on the root chakra, we can promote balance and healing in this area. This includes and governs the genitalia.\n\nThey don't mention the genitals because it might different between genders maybe? Anyway, why excluding anything that is part of the body?\n\nDon't forget to scan the anus too.\n\nLol\n\nThe meditations in books almost always include. It‚Äôs only meditations intended for audio and squeamish Americans that sensor. The pain of Puritans echoing through the centuries. \n\nTo all the forms I‚Äôm aware of, it‚Äôs an overlay, not part of the original practice. Good catch, op.\n\nNot weird given that the instructions come from religious traditions where the people are celibate.\n\nIn my experience people will mention the pelvis (or other equivalent term) rather than genitalia specifically, but that is what they mean.\n\nThere is no such meditation as body scanning Meditation at least in any asian tradition, not one in any mahasiddha tradition....\nCan't say if its something in the west but if its being done here then it's scam\n\nBecause genitals are outside for male. For females still scanned because inside the body.\n\nThey are not outside anymore than your arm or head is outside.\n\nAll the clitty‚Äôs I‚Äôve ever scanned have been outside. I think\n\nSome teachers will refer generally to the pelvic area, rather than specific organs. So scanning from the feet up, for instance, you may be told to go from thighs to pelvic girdle, which includes the genitals.\n\nI will say that attention at a specific area can increase blood flow to that area. That can become a distraction. \n\nThere are qigong meditations that do focus on areas like the perineum, but that's more than just scanning--it's intended to direct qi to or from different organs, which is a whole other thing.\n\nThe one I listen to says ‚Äúand the organs in this region‚Äù. You don‚Äôt have to exclude it.\n\nHmm I wonder\n\nWell, I never thought of the body scan as being a meditation, but I guess it is because it is a focus. I always thought of it as just a method to become more relaxed and reach the brainwave state of meditation. Progressive relaxation(similar to body scan) is also a good method for falling asleep. \n\nI usually start from the toes, and sometimes go more slowly, like toes, then soles, top of foot, ankle, etc., but often just do feet, lower leg, upper leg, etc. Why? ...because sometimes I'm in a hurry which I realize makes no sense from a meditation perspective, lol. \n\nAnyway, when I am doing the slower method I do include the genitals, and in the faster method they are just part of \"hips and pelvic region\". With either method, I can often feel muscles letting go of tension. I have never experienced any sensations from specifically relaxing organs, and that includes all of them, not just the naughty bits.\n\nSo IMO, the organs can be left out for the purpose of relaxation, but can be included for the purpose of improved health.\n\nTo add to all the good answers here, body scanning is intended to refine the nervous system in places we often ignore (like the earlobes). We are already extremely sensitive in the genitals so we don‚Äôt need to spend extra time there. But we don‚Äôt necessarily skip the genitals either it‚Äôs just that most guides will generally refer to the ‚Äúsacrum‚Äù so as not to draw too much focus to the genitals.\n\nOur genitals are so important to our beings!\n\nDo they?\n\nThis is interesting, I‚Äôve noted the exact same thing lately because I‚Äôve actively felt my frustration coming out my cock and balls. Hahaha. \n\nNo, like, for real though. it‚Äôs just my adhd brain seeking out any semblance of pleasure. Every time I meditate and they tell me to localize it all goes down there. And it‚Äôs angry. \n\nI wish there was like a dudes only meditation where we could just talk about dick. I understand people have suffered sexual trauma and I‚Äôm all for trigger warnings etc, but it‚Äôd be nice if that existed.\n\nI dont typically do guided meditations but have been turning to them more lately out of curiosity. And tbh they all kind of feel the same. Some of these YouTube titles really disgust me.\n\nOkay, quick inappropriate question. Feel free to not answer. Many men feel that a circumcision was trauma. They believe it's sexual abuse (I agree) and we have many communities to help you, if that is why your dick os angry... anyhow hmu if you need to chat.\n\nIve never heard of this before and I've been meditating seriously for a decade and not so seriously for another decade. I've done meditation in various yogic and Buddhist traditions, in Sufi tradition and in the Fourth Way\n\nWe'd do body scans including genitals  since day 1 in every group I've ever been involved with\n\nI really enjoy coming to reddit and reading someone claiming about how something is completely different from anything I've ever experienced. I wonder why its always blatantly absurd stuff\n\nI read an article today that was published on Vox this month: ‚ÄúThe jhƒÅnas are detailed in the TheravƒÅda Buddhist traditions of Southeast Asia and have their own particular meditation instructions, which typically involve sustaining attention on feelings of pleasure in the body.‚Äù\n\nBecause if they posted medications on YouTube that said ‚Äúnow scan your balls‚Äù, they wouldn‚Äôt get many views\n\nI scan mine.\n\nIt‚Äôs because ‚Äúscan your ballsack‚Äù doesn‚Äôt vibe too well during instruction\n\nI've also experienced that some instructions shamefully skip the genitals However, the body scan instruction I learned doesn't. I don't know what is more common nowadays. Besides that bodyscan instructions also have to include the pelvic floor, perineum and anus, which is, where Indian tradition locates the root chakra. The latter are not only seats of profound pleasure but also what grounds us in the earth, so excluding them from a bodyscan would be inexcusable.\n\nTara Brachs openhearted presence from march 2024 includes the ¬´pelvic region¬ª as she calls it.¬†\n\nRead this as scam meditations lmao\n\nMeditation is actually reaching Theta &amp; Delta waves while awake. You can be remotely doing anything that is opposite to stressful doing it, including doing sex.\n\nDeez nutz\n\nIt‚Äôs not a relevant argument.  Many people have body issues connected to these areas and getting involved in thinking about these is the reverse of learning to focus your attention.\n\nMine specifically focuses on the penis. ¬†It‚Äôs the only thing I scan repeatedly and then it suddenly grows a little more then I have to rescan it. ¬†Then it grows a little more then I rescan it. ¬† I keep repeating and then my wife meditates on top of it repeatedly while I scan her ass. ¬†It‚Äôs euphoric and I try to meditate once a day but if I‚Äôm too tired then my wife meditates on my face instead¬†\n\nTell me reddit is %90 men without telling me reddit is %90 men...\n\nSeems like you need to meditate more and focus on your genitals\n\nI saw your post about why body scan meditations often exclude the genitals, and I totally get where you're coming from. It's usually about cultural sensitivities and avoiding potential triggers for those who have experienced trauma. However, focusing on the pelvic area, sacral chakra, and root chakra can be a good workaround to include these important parts of our bodies.\n\nHere are some relevant free guided meditations on Insight Timer that can help:\n\n1.

There are [body scans which do include the pelvic region, though.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiHCU2CpB0)\n\nIs it really ridiculous? It's something the vast majority of the human species has. Why should it be ridiculous to mention that? People probably wouldn't find it something to avoid or giggle at if we had a more open dialog about our bodies in human society\n\nPragmatic people deal with the world as it is, not the way they think it should be, and a sizeable fraction of all humor revolves around genitalia. :-)\n\nOh it‚Äôs sizable alright ;)\n\nyou make a sizable point\n\nWe are it, we are the world (well, part of it). Changing the way we respond is changing the way the world is.\n\nI developed intellectually in a highly individualistic cognitive framework and it's always interesting to me to see how much the Buddhists fail to account for the individual's viewpoint (the perspective, the personality, the subjective view, whatever you want to call it). At best, they're treating it like some kind of amusing distraction, at worst as some fabrication that can and will ruin your life. I never understood how you can look at a flower and not see a miracle. Calling it an illusion demeans it (Don't get trapped in the scenery!, so to speak)\n\nI'm thinking of a Buddhist nun (a Westerner and older, I think you can find her on YT) that spent quite some time in caves meditating. She was referencing a situation she participated in a while ago.\n\nShe was in Thailand at the consular office, waiting in line to have her residency extended. The first in line was a Catholic priest (or, at any rate, some Christian denomination) who was being loudly berated by an immigration official for not following the process for filling out a form for residency extension properly. The gist of the story was that the priest had responded with nothing but politeness and respect. As we was departing, he took notice of the Buddhist nun and winked knowingly at her. I should add that she was smiling as she was recounting the story, the way one does when you're supposed to read between the lines and know what's all about.\n\nI paused there for a moment. I could the see the perspective of the Catholic priest. A human being, like you and me, with his flaws and resistances, being humiliated in public by a guy with a fragile ego that was taking pleasure in shaming him. I could see and understand his all too human instinct to hit back, I could see the training taking over, the gaze softening. What a good person! The nun surely seemed to think this way.\n\nBut I could also see the other side. How for a random participant to the scene, the situation was just confirmation that such behavior is acceptable, the government officials may indeed use their position to inflict random cruelty. I could see how \"Let things pass\" or \"Show only loving-kindness\" approach was destructive, a failure to deal with the here and now, to use a very Buddhist phrase, not with some Nirvana to be realized at some point.\n\nThe here and now works in rather set ways. You don't need to meditate until you see a golden star between your eyebrows to get it. Monkey see, monkey do. We're herd animals. We take notes from one another, sometimes the wrong ones that we need to spend some time to erase. But that's how it works and we know it.\n\nWhat the Buddhists do is essentially say \"Run away in a cave or a forest or look away because it's just going to distract you.\" My 2 cents are: sometimes being the source of one individual's suffering is worth it. Maybe if the priest responded sternly, the official may have had the chance to reconsider his approach. We'll never know because the priest wanted to save his soul, not the others' 15 minutes of being berated by the same official. I guess life in Heaven beats being yelled at.\n\nDid my remarks somehow bring to mind the thought that peaceful religious people lack Big Dick Energy? :-)\n\nThat's fair :)\n\nThey aren't excluded. It's socially sensitive information generally frowned upon so it's just harder to find. \n\nThere are many books written on this. Nothing I could recommend unfortunately not something I've pursued but I've run across them.\n\nI scan my genies\n\nfor the same reason why it‚Äôs weird to fart or burp in a modern yoga setting.\n\nBecause it becomes essentially a masturbation guide \n\nYou will have to change your occupation title from meditation counsellor to sex worker \n\nYou're basically getting people off in a different way \n\nThat would be interesting sex work hmmmm\n\n*I can raise dicks with my mind\"\n\nThat's a bit extreme, dont you think? Mentioning that you have genitals and glossing over them in your mind is not anywhere close to the act of masturbation.\n\nIf I were your audio guide and told you to feel scan and connect with your penis. In a voice that might accidentally come out sexy because it's hard to say that un-suggestively. Try it!\n\nWould you feel a bit... like I crossed a line?\n\nEDIT: additionally and more seriously don't you think some use meditation for addiction battles including sex addiction. In our already sex saturated world, you think you're in a place of refuge trying a healthy coping mechanism and then someone suddenly tells you to remove your pants ....\n\nAgain, that seems like an extreme example. I didnt say anything about penis' or taking pants off. I used the words gentalia and genitals deliberately, because A its gender neutral and B its a more sterile word than say \"penis\" or \"vagina\". Fair point about those with sex addiction and those with sexual trauma, though\n\nI guess. Genitalia is a horrible word so may avoid turning one on apart from the most determined of the horny\n\nAnd yes it's impractical to guess a readership's nether regions. \n\nInteresting conversation!\n\nDon't you find invisible haters (aka downvoters) cowardly? \n\nTo a level that seems actually embarrassing \n\nI only vote down once I've said what I dislike. It's not that provocative, it's just odd. What's the point?\n\nOk without disliking or liking I am telling you that what the modernized way of thinknig about sexuality is the one that's messed up and not the one that was before for so very long, you just think the way you do because you see others act that way, same as I do, it's why it's hard to break away from one's environment, usually doing so begins when you see something better and are willing to make the hard change towards it.\n\nOk but i see meditation as a tool some people, who are in the process of better but not quite there yet, use to get better. \n\nFor the people who are not quite in your enlightened mind (beginners and some are flawed in other ways) I think it's worthwhile to exclude the privates. \n\nPeople with sex addiction and as OP also said sex trauma might not be as enlightened and may feel triggered in some nuanced way\n\nThere are not that many obvious ways to cope healthily with meditation being one of those ways.\n\nI also don't think you need the body scan to include genitalia.  Will it make a difference? How relaxed do you need to be?!\n\nThat does make sense, and I imagine it is less about including the genitalia than it is about not excluding anything due to mental blockages/preconceptions, which takes time of course.\n\nI agree so keep meditation at level one\n\nLet people challenge preconceptions when they are stronger\n\nThere's not many level ones\n\nAnd this isn't a hill to die on\n\nalternatively how would you feel if a meditation asked you to focus energy in your taint?\n\nI'd slap the shit out of my phone"

    "body": "Okay‚Ä¶ so, I‚Äôve been getting back into meditation for the past several months. I have been doing it on and off for years throughout my life. When I used to meditate. I would go for hours and be in a trance like state. But, lately after not having done meditation for several years I‚Äôve been getting back into it. \n\nI started with 10 or 20 minute sessions. But then have been doing hour long sessions. But the longer I meditate. I‚Äôm noticing that a lot of pent up erotic thoughts come flooding into my mind. \n\nI then feel the urge to you know what lol\n\nAnyways‚Ä¶ yea, so this has been a new experience for me. Has anyone else experienced this? ",

    "all_comment_text": "So funny, I just went to an all day meditation retreat ran by monks and they talked about ‚Äúdistracting sensual thoughts!‚Äù So it‚Äôs super common üòÖ. For me personally, when I feel horny while meditating I just tell myself ‚ÄúI‚Äôll take care of it after I‚Äôm done meditating‚Äù üòÇ. Knowing that I‚Äôll do it later usually allows me to focus back on my meditation/the present moment.\n\nThat actually sounds like a good idea\n\nI get this a lot, just explore the feeling, sit with it, not judging it or doing anything to it just sit with it, it will go away but not if you will it away, just observe\n\nOkay I‚Äôll try that\n\nfeel it move up ur body instead of lingering in genital region then the horniness will transform into being fully alive in your body\n\nthis is absolutely the way. you can channel it into glowing energy that will only attract more life\n\nI'd like to offer the opposite suggestion. \n\nIgnore it. It's trying to draw your attention. Return your focus to your anchor.\n\nI like to use the story of the Buddha facing Mara before enlightenment. It's a great analogy for what we're going through while meditating. Mara sends their beautiful daughters to entice Siddhartha but he remains unfazed by their allure. Whereupon Mara sends the full force of their army to bring the blossoming Buddha down.\n\nMara in this case is the mind, trying to get us to shift away from our focus anchor - to knock us off the path that's the width of a knife's edge. The Daughters are all those sexual thoughts that pop up, while the army is all the other absolutely batshit crazy stuff the Mind will pull from in order to draw your attention. \n\nAs a counter to this though. There are some meditative techniques that are meant to be used to redirect all that sexual energy. There's a reason monks remain celibate, and it has nothing to do with upsetting some divinity. Rather people report having an easier time reaching deeper states of meditation while abstaining.\n\nWhen you observe the thoughts, what should be going on inside your head? Specific types of questions or nothing at all? Or something else?\n\nSomething like ah temptation there you are again tempting me with pleasure of the flesh I‚Äôm busy right now leave your name and number after the tone and I‚Äôll get back to you.  I‚Äôve said that to myself, then filled with laughter I added but there will be no tone, Mara!! Muhahahaha!  Maybe it was a little less dramatic but you get the point I hope üôÇ.  Happy meditating üßòüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\n\nYes! Same with yoga. Big time. I sometimes have to stop.\n\nlol üòÇ it‚Äôs nice don‚Äôt get me wrong. But it‚Äôs definitely distracting\n\nIt‚Äôs the core exercises for me\n\nYou should look into ‚Äúcoregasms‚Äù üòÖ\n\n[deleted]\n\nI practice at home üòÇ I‚Äôm not perving out in studios ew lol\n\nyour username betrays you‚Ä¶\n\nOne thing that people don‚Äôt talk about is how there are things that will happen to try to block your progress with meditation.\n\nI‚Äôve been told by one meditator that they have been trying to come to a retreat for a while but every time they schedule to go something comes up that prevents them from attending.  They finally said enough and that they didn‚Äôt care what happened, they were going no matter what.  And they did.\n\nThere are thoughts that can come up by the mind that will break your concentration.\n\nThere are things that you might think you are experiencing but actually are not because your mind is tricking you.\n\nThere are pain sensations of the body you could start to feel that weren‚Äôt there when you first started meant to make you move to break concentration.\n\nYour body and mind do not want you to separate from them because they have controlled you your entire life.  So the body and mind does things to try to keep control over you.\n\nIt is something that I have never seen anyone online talk about but my grandmaster, master, and their followers all talk about the things that can block our progress.  Only through persistence, determination, and practice can we over come these things.\n\nThis makes total sense. While the ego is not an enemy, it is a prideful SOB that wants to remain in charge. How dare we open up the tomb section of the subconscious where the ego has imprisoned trauma and neurosis, and cleverly blocked it from view with distractions.\n\nPersonally I think you should Jack it. That‚Äôs what the Buddha would do¬†\n\nLOL\n\nUhh no he was celibate and so were his monks so no Buddha would not \"jack it.\" üòÇ\n\nHe would have if he was cool\n\nUsername checks out!\n\nMaybe I can convince him üòàüòàüòàüòà\n\nThat's great. That sexual energy is your strongest energy. Learn to sit with it and Harness it!\n\nIt's great if you're able to transmute it, but sexual energy has been the downfall of many spiritual aspirants and humans in general\n\nI wonder why the downvotes for your sober assessment of sexuality‚Äôs historical influence.\n\nYou just have to sit with it like others said. Acknowledging that it‚Äôs just another human emotion/energy and you will be able to harness the energy to your desire\n\nSacral chakra\n\nI mean I know this but no idea how to deal with this.\n\nObserve, don‚Äôt absorb. Release.\n\nnot sure if you know who dr.k (healthygamergg) is but tldr he trained to be a monk for 8 years in india and is also a psychiatrist. I remember him saying people who are deeper in their meditation journey often find that at the bottom of everything is feelings or sex and horniness so i think you're doing something right lol \n\nHe has quite afew different meditative practices you can try on his youtube\n\nlol huh? That‚Äôs funny because I do actually watch some of his stuff and I do remember him saying that\n\nye that was my initial react too LOL. I can't recall if he proposed a solution but maybe worth a look around lol. You can ask on their discord and subreddit if anyone recalls anything to that too\n\nHahah that‚Äôs kinda make sense. It‚Äôs the most important thing to ensure the specie survival after all. \n\nAlso Dr.K vids are so good. Recommended sub if you‚Äôre not already\n\nI love dr. K he‚Äôs actually the reason I started meditating and I‚Äôve been meaning to buy his guide for meditation\n\nDo you remember what video it is where he talks about that?\n\nno, you can ask in his discord and see if anyone remembers though\n\nId start by doing the pineal gland breath to liberate the energy\n\nHow do u perform it ?\n\nDude sameeee IÔ∏è thought IÔ∏è was the only one. It‚Äôs like IÔ∏è can‚Äôt meditate without getting extremely horny and end up having to take care of that\n\nThe feeling of your creative spark stirring is very close to the sensation of sexual energy, even though it's not entirely the same.\nThis is why some people feel \"horny\" during or after meditation or even a healing session. It's just your life force stirring. It's completely normal, your mind reacts to the sensation en projects what physically feels the closest, which is thoughts of sex.\n\nAmen brother üòÖüò§ one of us ü§ù\n\nYea def understand the eros energy.\n\nI would say that Tantric meditations would be best for moving that energy and cycling it into intentional directions.\n\nMeaning, you‚Äôd gain more control over the energy rather than it controlling you.  You could use it to increase your lust (which is amazing for sex) or you could channel it into creative endeavors.\n\nThey say that Eros energy is the energy of creation because it‚Äôs used for making babies or making passions.\n\nIt‚Äôs also useful to be able to calm the energy, for instance with lasting longer in sex for men, so we can have a passionate heart and an in-control body.\n\nBasic how to:\n\nTake the eros energy (horny energy) and imagine moving it away from your crotch and up your spine,\nthen up to the top of your head, then down through your forehead, through the roof of your mouth to your tongue, down the front of the chest and heart, back to your crotch through your belly button and again up through your spine.\n\nBreathe with your belly muscles with big, relaxed breaths.\n\nIt also helps to do kegel exercises while doing this (flex and relax the PC muscles in the pelvic floor).\n\nHuh interesting ü§î\n\n‚Äú takes notes‚Äù\n\nYou can check out The Multi-Orgasmic Man for more info on this\n\nI mean, why not have sex and then meditate.\n\nDon‚Äôt waste ur sexual fluids like that üò≠\n\nI mean what matters is the outcome right? If sexuality bothers you, deal with it firstüòä\n\nU won‚Äôt get away without semen rentention üò≠üò≠have a blessed day\n\nThe whole idea of meditation is to NOT give in to your impulses. Yes, sexual thoughts can be more intrusive because they are tied into the pleasure centers of the brain. The thoughts alone start the pleasure mechanism. \n\nYou should seek to do the same thing with sexual thoughts/feelings that you do with angry thoughts/feelings. Simply observe them without labelling. Once you are able to do this consistently, you will have advanced much more than those who struggle with simpler thoughts.\n\nIf you pursue your current tactic, you reinforce a thought/behavior loop of giving into masturbation for the pleasure peak, justifying it as \"quelling insistent thoughts\".  \n\nThe more insistent a thought, the more benefit you get from merely observing it.\n\nSexual cravings are one of the 5 Hindrances. This is Mara getting into your grill, if you let her.\n\nCommon for me , but same with deep relaxation feelings. I get this feeling in a sauna too. I think meditation causes your senses to get more sensitive? So physical sensation, yeah. I also allow the feeling to come and stay and try to get back into a calm state   Reminding myself that I have a healthy sex drive and sensual feelings like a normal human.\n\nI‚Äôm sorry I laughed so fucking hard when I saw the title\n\nHey well I‚Äôm glad I got a laugh out of someone\n\nNgl once I had an orgasm during meditation, but instead of it being primarily in my genitals it rose up and was a full body orgasm centered in the head area\n\nIt happened to me too‚Ä¶ I though I was crazy since thenü§£ü§£ü§£but I felt it, it was like 1 or 2 seconds tho\n\nHow does that happen\n\nNo clue.  The brain is mysterious.  I‚Äôve had some experiences during meditation that were as intense as literal drugs.  It‚Äôs crazy\n\nThis is relatable, not exactly only like getting horny but feelings similar to feeling more hungry or sleepy or wanting to move immediately...\n\nAs someone else mentioned in thread here, trick will be to be aware of these thoughts and telling yourself that it will be taken care of once done with meditation. In short - accept the thoughts as they are and let go. \n\nMy personal experience is something like this - if I resist particular thought, that's bound to pop up in next meditation session. If I accept and let it go, I feel like I am actually allowing them to pass through and then I don't get repetitive unwanted thoughts in next sessions.\n\nIt is probably ‚Äúsexual‚Äù thoughts or desires you have suppressed, and now that you sitting with yourself, and facing yourself they are popping up.\n\nThat's totally normal. You sit and relax, and sometimes sitting presses on pelvic floor muscles which can create such response. Just while meditating notice this, and go back to your meditation object\n\nIt's normal. Just sit with it like everything else. Bring yourself back to your focus. Allow the horniness to be there and allow it to pass, do not add to it or react. Let it sit with you and it will pass on its own.\n\nAll the time. I usually can suppress it after a couple minutes. Usually after meditating I'm not even horny so win win.\n\nIt's the same idea as any other sensation or emotion you feel, some are more compelling than others such as pain, arousal, an itch on your nose, and others like a slight breeze on your wrist are more subtle.\n\nYou could do some yoga practice that transmutes the sexual energy, then you might be more vital too\n\nVery normal.\n\nJust another way my mind tries to distract me\n\nMeditation is all about clearing your mind! If distracting thoughts keep popping up, acknowledge them and then let them go. Refocus on a single thought, and with practice, your mind will gradually learn to concentrate better.\n\nThat's that kundaliniiii\n\nIt's a thing, OSHO wrote it's most controversial book on \"Sambhog se Samadhi ki or\" which literally means \"Sex to Meditation\". I only know title üôà\n\nI‚Äôll have to check it out\n\nSorry forgot to tell its not in English, maybe you can listen his old English videos there you might find about this.\n\nI get that way meditating and after a workout\n\nOh I thought I was the only one‚Ä¶ üò≠\n\nDude same\n\nThis is an interesting topic. How to curb your lust and cravings in order to meditate better. \n\nI suppose this is why Yama (abstinences) and Niyama observances) come prior to dyhana (mediation) in the 8 limbs of yoga.\n\nBe a witness to that, don't act on it during meditation\n\nNofap\n\nRespect\n\nIt happens. The mind tends to wander to all sorts of places\n\nI get this as well. I always just view it as needing to overcoming my mamalliam brain/primal urges. Use it as a tool to be productive.\n\nRest brings calmness, calmness is something without stress and anxiety, and thus giving way for something like feelings and emotions. Enjoy it haha\n\nMan some people in here on some hoodoo voodoo shit. Completely lost the plot.\n\nare you regularly sexually active? Are your needs being met. \n\nyou are an adult, you are relaxed and away from the stress of life. Now is the time to get horny (biologically speaking, I dont think that meditation is prime boy/girl boner time).\n\nI guess that makes sense in a way\n\n[removed]\n\nUnfortunately, your karma is too low to post.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It would pull me out of meditation but now when the energy builds, I can let it move up my body and it‚Äôs liberating. I feel free of desire and fear in these moments.\n\nDirect the energy u feel upwards üòú\n\nyeah.. sensual cravings and desires are often the wall that prevent us from going further. it's why abstaining from porn, and even celibacy can become such an important role in our spiritual practice\n\nit can be overcome by things like masturbating only to the idea and feeling of being deeply loved by someone who really knows you, and you feel the same for rather than a focus on anything physical\n\nliving in the city I've found can be really incompatible and even much of the regular media we consume is often full of scantily clad women meant to boost these cravings and weaken resolve to resist.. it can often make us more insecure and selfish.. it's hard to not notice. spending time out in the countryside in nature can help offset this\n\nthe state of being where we're thinking about sex every minute or so is becoming common, it can be a great adversary in meditation\n\nif serious, staying away from stimulants, meats, and for some reason onions and garlic is commonly associated with difficulties in this endeavor as well... the understanding is beneficial spirits who would be helping us in our higher meditative vibrational states to overcome these are put off by pungent body odors after consuming these. we should shower before and also not fart during even when alone for similar reasons\n\nIts normal..\n\nSexual thoughts are thoughts, just noise that you are meant to acknowledge and ignore along with everything else while you're meditating\n\nJust recenter your focus on the present moment and like all feelings it will subside.\n\nYou watch porn and it's affecting your thoughts.\n\nI don‚Äôt actually watch porn very often\n\nDon‚Äôt. That‚Äôs great\n\nMe too. But especially after meditation. It drives to adult stuff strongly then. ü•≤\n\nThe thoughts should go away\n\nThe Gautama Buddha was, hinself, on the day of his Enlightenment\n\ntaxed by a trio of females who sought to distract him from his path. \n\nSo...who are you? Somebody special? Like you have this insurmountable \n\ndistraction?  Get to work, Kid !!  We ALL have things that distract us.\n\nAre you seeking your better self or not !!!\n\nSheesh.......\n\nI never claimed such a thing, all I‚Äôm saying is that it‚Äôs new to me\n\nAnd \"I\" am saying that the Path you say you are curious about \n\nis not easy nor is it simple. Its hard work, takes dilligence\n\nand if all you do is dabble with it, expect to be stiff-armed\n\nand swallowed-up by the phonies and the New Age\n\ntoy salesmen. \n\nNow. Do you want to work for the real thing\n\nor\n\nDo you want to Pretend to work for the real thing?\n\nIts an Honest question. \n\n\nFWIW.\n\nFast...\n\nIt might be something that your body is trying to communicate with you through. Maybe to tell you that your root is blocked or that you struggle with something that has to do with that. I think it's also important while meditating to connect with myself and ask questions about what comes up. If you can find out the why, you might just find something in your life that needs attention and be able to heal from something holding you back.\n\nFor me, meditation has 2 forms. It can be passive or active, and my body/mind/emotions tend to show me which I need at the time.\n\nYep. That's why I meditate!\n\nHow can I get to that?\n\nPractice‚Ä¶ lots of practice lol\n\nNormally I fall asleep after 10-20m\n\nThe only solution I‚Äôve found is to jack off plenty beforehand. \n\nI recently did a 10 day meditation retreat for the 2nd time. The 1st time I tried never giving into the desire. Well turns out sexual desire is like food desire where it doesn‚Äôt just die away with time, it increases till you fulfill it. 2nd time I made a point to jack off as soon as sexual thoughts arose (and when I was on my own). While I spent a decent amount of time during break jacking off, it completely gets rid of sexual thoughts and allows me to meditate better without that hindrance.\n\nHell no. Wasting ur sexual fluids won‚Äôt help u spiritually lol\n\nI feel like the assumption is that we have some limited amount of sexual/spiritual energy that‚Äôs lost when we ejaculate. There‚Äôs just no evidence of such thing. Most sperm is made. There‚Äôs nothing to conserve.\n\nU wasting ur sexual energy. Have a tougher life then üò≠üòéwe retainers know the benefits. It‚Äôs all up to u, at the end of the day brotha\n\nYou‚Äôre making a very testable claim. ‚ÄúJacking off has some noticeable affect on behavior.‚Äù So why isn‚Äôt there a shred of evidence to support that claim? Why is there no evidence sexual energy exists? Why can‚Äôt you conduct a study where some people ‚Äúretain‚Äù and others jack off a bunch and then measure their performance on a test? \n\nBecause there‚Äôs no such benefit. It‚Äôs placebo. You believe the age old myth that sex is bad, so when you refrain you feel holier than thou. \n\nBy all means, show me any sort of evidence at all besides ‚Äútrust me bro‚Äù and I‚Äôd be happy to change my mind.\n\nSex isn‚Äôt bad, never said that. I don‚Äôt need studies for something that I practice daily. After one week of retaining, testosterone is through the roof. There are studies but it is not promoted by mainstream media ofc\n\nBy all means, show me the studies.\n\n[removed]\n\nThat is not what kundalini is."

ANGER!!!!!\n\nAh one of my favorites from FakeBuddhaQuotes.com\n\nhttps://fakebuddhaquotes.com/buddha-was-asked-what-have-you-gained-from-meditation-the-buddha-replied-nothing-at-all/\n\nDid the Buddha actually ever say this? Please stop. Talk about your own experiences instead.\n\nSomeone already posted a link debunking it as a legitimate Buddha quote. I have read that quote many times and it has never sounded like the kind of speech the Buddha uses in the sutras. It sounds like a modern quote and it is.\n\nYou should always provide name of the Sutta with chapter and verse: [Index of Suttas](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/index-sutta.html) üòÑ\n\n‚ÄúI never said that.‚Äù - Buddha\n\nYou only lose the negative aspects of yourself from consistently meditating.\n\nI don‚Äôt think you lose those either. You just see them differently\n\nIt's very true what you have said.\n\nIt gets to a point where one's parasympathetic nervous system dominates and rules over the body as opposed to the sympathetic nervous system. Over time, the right amygdala reduces in size.\n\nOther changes occur which make it seem like we have lost these things.\n\ni view it like this \nthe immature human,  the brain creates their yang (spirit)mind- ego, as a result of its bioelectric and biochemical metabolism,  like a fire constantly fed by oxygen and fuel\n\nthe mature person is able to assert their will through tapasya,  and at this point,  the mind begins to create the brain,  slowly ending negative habits and building positive ones.\n\nIs that based in science? When do those effects kick in? I've never experienced a reduction of anxiety or depression so I gave up on meditating.\n\nhttps://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6302143/\n\nhttps://medicine.utah.edu/students/wellness/what-is-wellness/mindful-meditation/how-does-it-work\n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=pi9Xvh-Dva4\n\nHow long did you commit to meditation? It has to be a lifestyle and should be done consistently daily. Studies show the brain visibly changes in just 6 weeks of daily 30 minutes of meditation.\n\nHi there! In my experience, meditation is life changing. My daily anxiety attacks are almost non existent and my cynical mind is less cynical each day because of a daily meditation practice. I meditate at least 2x a day with a daily journal in which I enter my daily gratitude practice along with any notes from dharma talks, workshops, mini prompts, or just reflections. I do believe that this has to be a lifestyle, daily practice for you to feel the effects. Also, one more comment, some meditation sessions, my mind is going a million miles an hour and that is perfectly normal. When you spend the day ignoring thoughts, distracting yourself with phones, or just not dealing with the moments in front of you, they need to come up someway. Meditation is that outlet and a platform for your thoughts to be addressed. It takes time and commitment to at least meditate for 30 minutes a day.\n\nI agree. Meditation just shifts your perspective.\n\nIf you ask me (24 years of meditation experience) I did not even lose those.\n\nNo doubt we do not totally lose everything that Buddha cites but we shed part of it and that is already not bad\n\nFake\n\nWith meditation you realize your true identity and lose everything, only to be liberated and left with nothing. You are left with nothing but also you gain everything :)\n\nSometimes losing is the real gain\n\nKind of a dickish way to respond\n\nThe vast majority of meditators never lost these things.\n\nWho's the majority? The people who practice for 10 minutes in the morning? Or people whose practice are a huge priority in their lives?\n\nI definitely think that regular people like us, if we put a lot of time and energy into practice,  can come to a point where we can understand the mechanisms of our anxiety and depression from a first-hand perspective and get to a stage where they don't make much of an impression anymore. Same for anger.\n\nI speak as someone who was diagnosed with depression 3 years ago, for whom therapy and meds didn't do jack. Obviously not everyone is going to be willing to change their whole life structure and give a lot of energy and time to the cultivation of awareness, but it works.\n\nYour second paragraph doesn't necessarily need to have anything to do with meditation. \n\nYour assumption that it is is a judgement from a mistaken perception. \n\nI've been meditating for 30 years and undiagnosed depression for more than 10.\n\nIt is not as simple as you suggest, I assure you unequivocally your perception is incorrect. My very existence is demonstration of this.\n\nI needed way more than meditation to have any effect on my depression.\n\nIt was one tool that is all and it bothers me deeply that its benefits are misrepresented like this because you will cause harm to those who believe it. \n\nMeditation, especially through self affirmation methods can cause those with depression to get worse not better. Your mindset can do harm and you need to change your perception of this.\n\nWe talk here all the time to try to help people avoid these traps. \n\nPlease do not walk right into one.\n\nIt's not \"simple\" by any means, any more than making any huge life change is simple. Nor is it instantaneous. There were more relapses than I can count, but each one less in intensity and duration, and each time I learned something new.\n\nWhat you call positive self affirmation (metta) was part of it, most of the work was actually questioning beliefs, and training new ways to relate to feelings and thoughts of depression that brought empowerment and release in an on-going way, beyond just sitting for an hour and then forgetting about meditation for the rest of the day.\n\nI'm aware that not everybody who experiences depression is up to this task, and even if one is open to the idea it requires practicing in the correct manner and having the correct paradigm behind the practices, otherwise it will only lead to old habitual tendencies of thought and behavior taking over before the new ones can settle.\n\nAre you aware you completely ignored everything I said and are continuing to promote a course of action which we have members of this community who have been harmed by it? \n\nYou need to go read posts from the last week here someone just posted a very well expressed warning concerning this and your advice here is flatly going to hurt people the way you are expressing it. \n\nYou need to stop and go read that post and while you're at it read the dozens of others that exist in this group you'll find over the months. \n\nYou are speaking outside of your understanding. You need to stop trying to sound authoritative about it and understand real people's experiences other than your own. \n\nMy mind is not your mind is not their mind. \n\nYou do not seem to be aware of this, you should not be giving these generalized suggestions they are known by science to be wrong. \n\nYou have a belief from judgement not expertise here.\n\nJust relating my experience, I know I'm an outlier and that not every depressed person suddenly gets motivation to go deep into the buddhist rabbit hole and make practice their entire lives, lots of people are greatly helped by medication and talking in therapy. It just didn't work for me.\n\nAnyways have a good one.\n\nYou related your experience as being useful to others without consideration until now though. Your consideration now is known to be inappropriate.\n\nYou certainly believe it helped we can see that. But you may want to be careful of that assumption. False improvement can come on the back of that kind of understanding.\n\nI never mentioned medication and it sounds like you have biases in your mind about what I'm talking about that are probably related to some other unstated part of the belief you aren't expressing here.\n\nSuggesting meditation as treatment for depression outside of a therapeutic context would get a Dr to lose their license for malpractice. \n\nThat is your current recommendation. You need to understand the fact of that observation outside of your judgement here.\n\nYour intention here might be good, but youe careless application of it is known by observation to be harmful to those with mental illness because it gives them false hope. \n\nYou think you are doing good, you are not, that will be read as false hope for people who are vulnerable. \n\nThat's not very responsible.\n\nNothing is a very powerful if looked and understood in the right context :)\n\nHow could you gain what was already available to you?\n\nI mean obviously you can meditate and then feel better, so this quote has GOT to mean something like I just pointed out.\n\nEdit: on second thought this could even be something the Buddha directly did not say or taken out of context because it's way too profoundly simple. Over simplification.\n\nAVERT YOUR EYES\n\nTruth. I have been putting in more effort and am enjoying the profound mellow.\n\nMeditation frees us from so much mortal baggage.\n\nBuddha was chopping water and drawing wood one day. A student came before him.  \n\n‚ÄúMaster, what are you doing?‚Äù  \n\nThe Buddha, seeing his student‚Äôs curiosity and open mind, replied ‚Äújust locking in no cap fr fr on God.‚Äù  \n\nThe student, satisfied, snowed all over Mount Fuji.\n\nIf Buddha was asked if the world was flat he would  have answered yes, because he had no education or knowledge to back him up. Nobody should listen to these dead people, but listen to their own wisdom instead.\n\nyou do actually gain nothing. you already have everything you need\n\nCool story bru"

    "all_comment_text": "Every single day my friend‚Ä¶ Friday always when it‚Äôs at its lowest but Monday is my worst day.\n\nSunday scaries can be a lifelong affliction, I just accept it now\n\nYou ain't kidding!\n\nI feel like we are living in an infinite cycle every single day\n\nI can definitely relate!\n\nI've been practicing surrender with this feeling of dread and it's been getting lighter and lighter with time. I think it has some deep roots in childhood trauma (for me at least.)\n\nThis is what I do:\n\n* Whenever I notice the feeling I do my best to welcome it - \"ah, hello dread my old friend.\" (Advice from Ram Dass and Rumi.)\n* I watch the feeling in concert with my breath and gently avoid holding my breath.\n* I gently relax any tension with extended exhales, if there's space.\n* I do my best to just ride the waves of emotion and stay present meaning to aim to continually maintain my attention on whatever is arising emotionally and somatically.\n* I let go of any stories, interpretations or other thoughts by convincing myself that the most important thing during this process is my emotions and sensations and that getting hooked on thoughts is a hindrance.\n\nThe best techniques are the ones that work for you. Use your practices as anchors to help you remain present and focused on whatever is arising.\n\nThis great!  I've also read similar coping tools in The Happiness Trap by Russ Harris and there is actually an illustrated version which I thought was silly at first but extremely helpful ways to use ACT. \n\nI'm going on 2 weeks now with no morning anxiety and more relaxing Sundays.  It also helps that management is extremely supportive so a lot of it is just welcoming the thoughts as just thoughts as you said. \n\nI also recently successfully completed a HUGE project so I have learned to congratulate myself. I may be riding a wave but also may have trained my brain to always find the positive in any situation.\n\nSometimes anxiety starts when there's too many stressful issues going on at the same time in your life.  Each issue adds to the stress and going to work is another stressor, even if you like your job and coworkers.  He's some ideas:  reduce caffeine especially energy drinks that add caffeine plus supplements that really increase the body's stress level.  Stop drinking caffeine at noon.  Get enough sleep and rest.  Limit alcohol and drugs. Start thinking about problem solving other stressful issues to make life easier:  dealing with family, money issues, chores at home, etc.  Take a walk every day. Take the anxiety as a sign that your overall stress level is too high and work on redesigning your life.\n\nExcellent advice\n\nThanks!\n\n[removed]\n\nThank you!  I have more ideas but this is the short version.\n\nThank you!\n\nSo glad to be helpful!\n\nThat could be true. Thinking back I was always stressed out when I was young, was ordered to do something I don't like to do. The \"order\" was the trigger and I think it accumulated over many many many years and I just keep sucking up. That might have taken the toll out of me and my mental health. Like what you said, relationship, money, work, chores. All these problems keep cycling in my life. That's why meditation especially the breathing ones makes me calm and beginning to let go of things.\n\nGood insight and interesting.   The idea that someone is forcing you (even now) can lead to  dragging your feet, being angry and resistant. You are saying it still happens?  Is the underlying  belief \"I should not have to do this\"? \"It's not fair\"? Do you think the habit of your resistance to having to do things could be turned around.  Instead of seeing the task as forced, see the process as \"I enjoy it when things are clean.\" Or \"I create something beautiful,\" or \"As an adult, I enjoy being in charge of my own stuff.\" and \"I'm in charge of myself.\"\n\nIt reminds me of the concept of willingness which can be very helpful and includes these:\n\nOpenness: being open to your experience as it is, without changing it, avoiding it, or escaping it.\n\nAcceptance: being willing to accept what is, and responding in an appropriate way,\n\nMindfulness : acting mindfully and being present\n\nFlexibility: responding to life circumstances with flexibility, rather than judgment or stubbornness.\n\nThanks for your very interesting thoughts and ideas!\n\nSame..the feeling of dread can be too much like on a Sunday afternoon, just the thought of a new week, 5 days of going to the office gives me anxiety‚Ä¶could be a real sign of burnout üò•\n\nVery true, I‚Äôm semi retired now but for years I felt the same way. Get to a gym, walk, do something even if it‚Äôs only 1/2 an hour a day, that‚Äôll help.\nI was told 20 years ago that this form of anxiety was a sign of burnout.\n\nYes i used to when i worked cubicle lyfe.   However for me it was leaving my dog behind.    He was my soul dog and i'd always get a pit in my stomach seeing his little smiling face im the window as i walked away.   That's why i came home everyday at lunch lol just to see him.\n\nFeel you. I feel so guilty leaving my little furry man behind. He started following me when I walk. \n\nThe feeling described is understandable. What worked for me was having a job in walking distance. Walked every day and it's a perfect 15 minute little walk. Don't got that job anymore unfortunately, but I still got my walks!\n\ni'm\nlucky now in that i've changed careers and can take my dog with me to work.   (I started a pet sitting business 3+ yrs ago to honor my soul dog and my new dog is my coworker)   Works out perfectly.\n\nYES!!!! I started taking L theanine, GABA and ashwaganda supplements to help with this\n\nDo these supplements reduce or eliminate the anxiety and dread?\n\nThey helped me for sure, it was a noticeable difference\n\nYea me too. I told my doctor about it and she was recommending L theanine. But I could see the effects of reducing the anxiety yet. I just started taking it for 1 week. Ashwaganda makes me sleepy at work, so it's not suitable for me now.\n\nI do but I don‚Äôt like my job one bit and don‚Äôt know how to find a comparably paying job that is less stressful. My current job causes me significant stress due to the pressure of my workload.\n\nSame. Why do you think you won‚Äôt find a comparable one? I ask because I tell myself this all the time. So in turn, I become really edgy and manic. And I feel like people can see it. Does it get easier because you‚Äôre so busy? Sometimes I forget to breath bc I‚Äôm so busy trying to get through the checklists‚Ä¶\n\nEveryday but it‚Äôs better once I‚Äôm in the building still get nervous there though at times\n\nRecently I have followed master mantak chia in his smiling practice which improves my energy and mood. You can Google it.\n\nI feel this way about work most days that I go. I happen to have adhd and autism, so most of my anxiety stems from worries about managing symptoms related to that. I just try to prepare anything that would make me more physically comfortable and take short breaks as needed\n\nCrushing, debilitating, spiraling anxiety every day. Tried everything. Sober for 12 years, marathon runner, great kids. Manic doubt. It‚Äôs about managing stress and stemming the spiral. Try and think positive things. Even the smallest positive. Take a breath, lotsa times ü•≤\n\nEverytime. The thought of leaving the comfort of my warm home and going to a place full of suffering, capitalistic traps and eorkplace politics can really do a number on anyone. \nI am a Healthcare worker so it's especially draining because I have to attend to sick people and it's constant negativity at a stretch.\n\nSometimes I am so drained by the end of the day that makes me really feel anxious to go to work. Its like I literally count the hours left to leave from there. You are not alone.\n\nWhat helps me is giving myself a pep talk when I wake up, venting in my head And than doing some breathing exercises to control my heart rate. Than I usually put on my favourite music. Also I wake up early so I don't have to rush through chores and can take my own sweet time to get ready or battle the traffic. That can make shit worse lol.\n\nI also try to have my favourite breakfast on the days I particularly feel anxious or just go sit in my garden gazing at the beautiful flowers\n\nIn your case, pls also think of the people that you help and support every day. How happy (and hopefully) grateful they are for you taking care of them. People working in healthcare really make a difference, even though not every patient is capable of expressing this. \n\nMy mum was in hospital for 4 months and being with her 4 hours a day at least during that period, learned me how patient, supportive and caring you and your colleagues are.\n\nOh yeah. But my case is I am extremely burnt out after 5 years working for the same team while undervalued and underpaid by my company. Actively looking for another job though\n\nI can relate so much!\n\nThat's me on a daily basis. It's like an overwhelming dread of having to actually go to work. But once I'm there it's usually fine. Then going to bed dreading having to go to work the next day. Honestly, for me at least, even if I like my job my customers and most of my coworkers, I think I'm just over the entirety of work life in general, like it never seems to end\n\nYeah that is the exact feeling I got. Once I reach the office everything is like normal. When I go back I had this feeling like, ahh it's gonna start again tomorrow\n\n100%! Which makes me question, is the anxiety related to a complex being triggered to be worked through or is it simply a feedback mechanism saying you‚Äôre out of alignment and should be doing something else. Don‚Äôt know the answer yet\n\nThe latter but likely both to some extent. The simple truth is that none of us should need to sell our time to get by. Scarcity is manufactured and abundance is suppressed/hidden/destroyed, bcs of this we are all slaves in modernity. The gut is telling you you were meant to be free and let passion and joy light your way. The office is killing your spirit, stealing your energy, your life literally is being diminished by the vampiric parasite systems in place. \n\nLike mosquitos swarming, taking your vital fluid bit by bit until you die. Most don't even swat at then anymore..\n\nI been thinking about this too. I like my job but working conditions, especially management are bad and confusing. So maybe my career is right but the job is wrong, and that's why I am out of alignment.\n\nYeah. It‚Äôs worth exploring and trying to narrow it down.\n\nI cry every day before work despite the fact that I like my job. I just deal with it it's purely physical at this point I don't even care¬†\n\nEvery day. Glad I found this post, thank you for posting.\n\nHoly smokes, this is me as well‚Ä¶ I think it has caused IBS issues in my life. I thought I was the only one!\n\nSame here... Desk job and stress triggered some form of IBS. How do you manage ?\n\n[deleted]\n\nThat's a very good point. I might just want to get it checked to see if there is anything wrong. Thanks for pointing this out, really appreciate it.\n\n+1 and Waking up earlier may help, just to take some time to let those cortisol levels balance out. \n\nHave a nice little slow morning where your only task is to drink some water, make yourself breakfast, eat it and enjoy it - maybe go for a walk if you have time (sometimes movement rather than stillness may help process the stress hormones)\n\nI know society likes to prescribe ~waking up early~ as a means to ~boost productivity~ but in reality do the opposite, focus on nourishing your body and give yourself time take it easy \n\nWith all that said - cortisol isn‚Äôt bad, it‚Äôs actually strongly correlated with dopamine and fuels motivation, inspiration, and planning and often brings a sense of alertness. yet it causes a lot of issues when you‚Äôre doing something stressful but sedentary when it  spikes - even if that activity isn‚Äôt necessarily causing the spike‚Ä¶ie commuting is often a light stressor, - you may notice you‚Äôre tense when you‚Äôre driving to work - which makes sense‚Ä¶it‚Äôs natural to be in self preservation mode while driving \n\nLike everyone is saying be in your body and notice when you‚Äôre tense and find some time in your day to do some active recovery to process the stress \n\nIt‚Äôs all about small changes and adjustments and seeing what works - don‚Äôt retreat or make a huge life decision in that state, just have a conversation w your body and try to avoid being mad at yourself or blaming your body for this negative feeling :) - kudos to you for acknowledging it and not ignoring it üíï otherwise your body will make you listen\n\nAnd don‚Äôt listen to the negative ‚Äúwelcome to late capitalism‚Äù comments‚Ä¶.yes there are deep issues with society and economics but leaning into that is a defeatist mentality - the truth is we can all do something about our mental state and self- regulate and to those people who have given up ‚Äúbecause society‚Äù I challenge you to imagine a society where we‚Äôve all done the work to take care of ourselves and to process our emotions, self regulate, and looked inward - your breath is free - it‚Äôs ok to acknowledge the state of the world and feel a certain way about it but do your best to build resilience and not be discouraged - take care of yourself (physically and mentally) and you‚Äôll be surprised at your capacity to be there for others, your ability to remain at ease in stressful situations (rather than powering through them while anxiety takes it‚Äôs toll), and your jobs (hate them or love them) will not define you - as nothing you produce or do determines your worth - it‚Äôs inherent\n\nIt's so interesting reading the comments that so many of us have the same experience. I've had a number of different jobs, including my 'dream' one. What I found is that anxiety is still present and expresses itself in different forms. It made me realise, in my case, that the anxiety was coming from me in the first instance and the way I interpreted the world. I think sit with the feelings and explore what comes up for you. It could be your job, how you feel about your situation at the moment in general, or it could be deeper. You've already observed so much already. All the best!\n\nI think we are condtioned this way since childhood while going to school and going to college and now to the work. Because there will always be people above us whom we have to listen. like teachers and boss at work and anxiety of disappointing them. May it be assignments or deadline at work which creates a stressfull environment. Anyway, Since this lifestyle is going to stay i think this feeling might settle down as we grow older. I wonder how is the scenario for those who owns a business.\n\nNon existent, same for gig workers and remote work too\n\nI didn't notice this but you are right. I was pretty anxious growing up. As a kid I always puked before reaching my preschool and my parents were like what's wrong with this kid. Then mid school, highschool and college were the same, but without the puking. Without realizing it haunted me back when it comes to work.\n\nYes. Very much so. I also really struggle with my job. For me the anxiety goes away with good sleep.\n\nI feel anxious too, but my reason work load and not really feeling comfortable with my colleagues\n\nI have been there! For me it turned out it was imposter syndrome and while I was getting better and better at faking my way through it, the more I meditated and got closer to who I really am, the harder it was for me to keep up the charade. The anxious feeling was just my body telling me this wasn't good for me. so I quit!\n\nMaybe the drive?\n\nI totally know how you feel. I love my job so much, it's literally everything I've ever manifested and yet all the time I have a pit in my stomach. When I'm going in I'm nervous about doing something wrong during the day and when I leave I'm anxious that I didn't do enough LOL helppp\n\nThis was my life when I worked at an call center, it was one of the most challenging jobs iv done and I would dread weed days, I was anxious a lot, going to work was the worse. This no longer happened when I started working at a job where I was more in control and actually was part of my goal. The call center was just a job to have a job, not a career, I hated it. I also had anxiety during high school, specifically nearing report card days. My old man was tough on me, and that took a toll on me, so showing up with poor grades was the worst thing in thing ever.\n\nI still dealt with anxiety for many years but not at the level of that job, at one point during my actual career job, I found myself extremely anxious and having mild panic attacks, turns out, I was just having way too much cuban coffee. The anxiety I usually dealt with through my life was performance related, such as in public, while meeting with superiors, competing in a sport. \n\nI then started meditating, and that changed everything for me. Here's what I could share and hope that it can help.\n\nWe're anxious because of our mental attitude and our expectations, and also a bit of self asteem. If you dont value yourself highly and truly believe you are deserving of the job, then you'll be anxious about it because you'll feel that you might be exposed any minute and get fired. I started to feel better when I would question my thoughts and try to get to the root of WHY im being anxious and worrying. I would ask myself, what are you worried about? and then list out the things that I think I was worried about. Then, I would go over that list and evaluate if it's something in my control or not and if the worry really warranted. 90% of it was all garbage thoughts that kept me worked up. The act of noticing this alone was super helpful. Then, those things that I did have control of, I started to focus on them and improve on them. This overall helped me immensely.\n\nIn recent, I have started martial arts again, this too was something I would be anxious about when I would go to class, and now as a much older adult, I experienced the same when I started, now I have confidence in it and no anxiety. However, when it's time to compete or sign up for a competition, anxiety shows up, but this is a normal human response. What I do now though is, not call it anxiety. Instead, I replace the words \"nervousness and anxiety\" with excitement. This made a huge difference when competing, and now I use this in everything. Anxiety and nervousness have been replaced with excitement. Maybe try shifting your focus to thinking its excitement, not anxiety that you're experiencing? \n\nTaking supplements, teas, etc... for anxiety, while helpful, does not solve the problems and the mental attitude. Self-doubt, worry, and fear are what need to be eliminated.\n\nWhat worries you that keeps you anxious about your job? think about that, and really ask, is this really a big deal, is it even something you can control, if it is then do better to the best of your abilities, and if theres nothing you can do, let it be, stop worrying.\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention that another big change I had was better breathing. Poor quality of breath can mean anxiety and elevated cortisol.\n\nI hated my job so much I meditated for over 2 hours at day at work to alleviate the symptoms. We spend too  much time working and taking care of others and we require meditation to correct this problem. Retired now with well over 10,000 meditation hours logged in at work.\n\nSAME HERE. My first years as an employee was torture, nightmare and hell, because I knew that it was going a very physical and stressful day and many hours. I've changed my job and I still feel a little bit of anxiety , specially when I know that it's gonna be a tough day. \n\nIt gets better with time but I don't know if this anxiety will ever dissappear.\n\nYes, I used to have this when i had just started working at a criminal lawyer‚Äôs. Everyday, in the morning before going to work, in the washroom I‚Äôd have such depressing mood. And everything at the job was perfectly fine! Good colleagues and boss and everything, something was off. That job I left in a month. Eventually I gave up career in law altogether and started my meditation channel.\n\nWhat is the name of your meditation channel?\n\nMeee\nEverydayüòÇ\n\nEvery day.\n\nHave you tried meditating in the morning before work ?\n\nI feel varying degrees of anxiety going anywhere there are people.\n\nDo you drink strong coffee? Took me a few years to realize high amounts of caffeine make me crazy anxious.\n\nNo I don't drink coffee/tea/sodas. Just water. Though I love soy milk..does it have any effects on anxiety?\n\nI don't. Drink that. Much. Coffee   Iam already energized  ready. To tackle the  day\n\nYes, same! I try to manage it with breathing exercises and taking a morning walk. \nBut  I also often feel anxious during the workday, especially meetings make me jittery and a bit manic. What to do then?\n\nYep, never not felt that. Meditation helped because meditation helps everything, but yeah I‚Äôm looking for jobs/independent stuff that doesn‚Äôt require that. \n\nWhen I was in college I got an internship over the summer which was all summer 9-5 and it nearly killed me. Would throw up on my way to work everyday, have immense anxiety all day. Paid me really well for doing almost nothing, but that was the hardest job I ever had. Still never recovered though. \n\nMade some improvements in my life started working again and got less than a year in before burning out. I‚Äôm also autistic. But yeah, it‚Äôs not even that the jobs were too hard I just could never calm myself down in that environment.\n\nAbsolutely!  For well over 2 years on and off. I have recently learned to praise myself and cut out the noise all while welcoming the anxious thoughts as just thought. As soon as you stop fighting it the better it is. I won't say that it isn't hard. \n\nI'm a lifelong sufferer of severe panic and anxiety disorders. I also suffer from social anxiety. I used to be an extremely confident person or at least pretended to be. I can turn it on when I need to although it is exhausting. \n\nI transferred to a new department about 7 months ago. It isn't the best environment to make friends. It is high stress and there are 19 things going on at once. So I also deal with loneliness too. Which feeds the low self esteem. \n\nI have to say that I recently completed a major project and was praised up and down by many people. I don't know if I learned to praise myself or if I am just riding a wave so to speak.\n\nImposter syndrome was real for a while. I think this project gave me confidence and now I feel like I know what I'm doing. I also have been reading self help books, practicing mediation, positive self talk including mantras and manifestations. \n\nI highly recommend the book Hardwiring Happiness by Rick Hanson. It is very scientific written by a neuroscience but explains things in a very simple way. I have been listening to the audio book on repeat for weeks now on and off. \n\nThis book coupled with The Happiness Trap by Russ Harris which is another easy read about Acceptance &amp; Commitment Therapy (ACT) which my therapist incorporates in CBT workshops.  \n\nI don't know if it's the combination of things or what but I have been work-anxiety free for 2 weeks and have been able to relax on Sundays which is very new to me!\n\nI hope you find what works best for you ! There is hope.  Self-care, eliminate toxic relationships, set boundaries, do whatever it takes.  This is your health!\n\nI have to remember all I can do is tell you my experience. I am also highly anxious person, in thousands of different ways. I hate it, all the emotions that anxiety throws at us. But it‚Äôs really us, we are our thoughts.\n\nI try to Meditate on the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù source of my anxiety, I try to simply ask the question and try to be still in body and mind. The key is I ask‚Ä¶ wait‚Ä¶ Breathe. \n\nI miss spoke, meaning contemplate that during meditation. Don‚Äôt make it a goal or a task, you already know why you just can‚Äôt see it. Just watch your awareness and be present, when thoughts disturb you go back into it. If it‚Äôs frustrating stop and wait. Helps me see things.\n\nI‚Äôve just been introduced to ‚Äúbrain tapping.‚Äù Its incredible. I felt an instant release and sense of calm and clarity. I have done two sessions now and people around me see a difference in my anxiousness. That‚Äôs saying a lot. Best sleep I‚Äôve had in a long time too.\n\nDo you mind sharing how it works from your experience, so people around here have a choice/options they can try out.\n\nI had this‚Ä¶ dreaded the drive in 6-7 days a week.\n\nFelt i was carrying my unhappiness into my home life.\n\nI left. Changed career.\n\nThe anxiety is no more.\n\nI expect it's because deep within us. We know this is not what our \"soul\" wants/needs. But it is the system we are in, to have to work to make money, for our needs. It seems we either need to figure out a way to somthing we create ourselves and make money that way. Or simply accept our occupation that we have. Anxiety will come our way regardless of what we are doing in our lives. But the inner work remains the same, feel it without judgment, and it passes through. ‚úåÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nThis is how I feel with going to school, or the dreading of a presentation, or exams. I simply just sit uncomfortably with those thoughts, as much as I want to run away from the feelings, it will always remain there. I can‚Äôt get rid of it no matter how much meditation or yoga I do, but to simply just accept it for what it is.\n\nWanting to work on anxiety:  make a list of 3, 4, 5 issues that cause you stress and label thoughts and feelings associated with them.  Like, \"I am worried about \"fill in the blank.\"  Are you stressed because you're too busy?  Is your environment too noisy or chaotic?  Is the TV computer or music too loud? Does someone in your life abuse drugs or alcohol and it affects your life?  Do family members friends or partners argue with you or control you?  Are you being bullied or harrassed?  All these issues can contribute to anxiety, depression, lack of sleep and mood problems.\n\nWelcome to late capitalism\n\nJust here to say I experience this. Haven't really found a remedy.\n\nI used to. I used to have bad anxiety. Now i eat healthy, work out, and work on me. Have you heard of [The Mental Shift](https://thementalshift.beehiiv.com/subscribe)? You should check it out sometime. They gave me excellent pointers to keeping a clear mind with habits.\n\nThank you for sharing this. Will check it out later. Really appreciate it.\n\nI just found this new app Blissy where we can connect with healers for free, I tried it yesterday talked randomly with some healers having same issues and felt so good, give it a shot it is good\n\nThank you for sharing. I think everyone in this conversation can benefit from this as well. Really appreciate it.\n\nFind a new job foreal. It's not worth your mental health\n\nI have been feeling this recently!!! I don't know what to do. I want to work from home and really detest going into office 3 times a week. I feel anxious on the first day i go into office. Don't know what to do!!\n\nYes. And with these strict mandates that a lot of large companies are implementing on top of taking away some employee benefits, it‚Äôs going to get worse.  These large companies will be looked upon for smaller companies to follow suit to get maximum efficiency out of their employees at a reduced cost.\n\nIf you haven't already. Exercise, and enough sleep go a long way.\n\nYes, to the point I am not able to work..  it's horrible and I'm not sure how to get help with it.\n\nEvery single effing day‚Ä¶.. hate my work‚Ä¶ hate every damn the thing\n\nI sense this could be stepping out of your comfort zone and also not living in the present. Ie that feeling of what the day will hold etc. I used to be like that a lot.\n\nI have been trying to understand how to feel and live in the present as I meditate. How is the feeling of living in the present as all the gurus of meditation spoke of. Any simple examples?\n\nEvery F‚Äôn day\n\nYep. And I LOVED my work. For a long time, I thought it was because I was getting older and tired, and maybe that had something to do with it, but moreso, I think our modern lives are unnatural, and on some level we understand this, and are beginning to rebel against it. \n\nA few years back, I began transitioning to freelancing, and now my psychic practice is growing and rapidly becoming my main income stream. I'm much, much happier. I do still teach twice a week in a classroom, and I love my students, but I'm even ready to give that up for the full-time at-home thing.\n\nNote: not everyone is a work-at-home person, but everyone has the ability to find a way to earn income that works better for them."

    "all_comment_text": "I‚Äôd put it a different way: if you care about humans and living things and can‚Äôt get a break from that caring or way to conceptualize healthily the harm that comes to yourself and others, then you will suffer. This is because at a minimum all living things die and all states of satisfaction will change to unsatisfaction. And that‚Äôs just sad. And that‚Äôs before you even bring in war and sadism and cruelty. \n\nThe trick is to get a break from caring.  Caring for yourself. Caring too much for others. It‚Äôs a strange thing but meditation helps you get a break from caring by reducing the importance of the self and getting you to accept the state of the world. Once you get a break through meditation, you are able to actually care more in a healthy and less attached way.\n\nYou can care and not suffer.  Indifference is the near enemy of equanimity.  When you don't care you have indifference.\n\nI‚Äôm not saying that people should become numb and not care. I‚Äôm saying many people don‚Äôt know how to reconceptualize suffering and also don‚Äôt know how to get a break from caring. It‚Äôs the break from caring that helps you care more deeply without drowning in depression.\n\nI think you mean non attachment. It appears similar to not caring on the surface, but I'd say they're definitely not the same.\n\nI agree that what I‚Äôm talking about is ‚Äúnon attachment‚Äù but to use layman‚Äôs language it‚Äôs close to getting a break from caring. Not in the sense that you don‚Äôt care whether horrible things happen but that you get a break from being forced to feel that feeling and focus on it\n\nYour explanation is helpful\n\nI‚Äôm glad it was helpful! I try to do my best to explain in simple language the things that have been helpful to me.\n\nCan you explain the practical difference between indifference and equanimity? Genuine question.\n\nCare is a great example.  When you're indifferent you don't care.\n\nAnother example is wants.  When you're indifferent you may not want anything.  When you have equanimity you can still want things you just don't suffer when what you're working towards doesn't pan out as intended.\n\nEquanimity doesn't have to care.  It doesn't have have to want.  When it's time to care, care.  When it's not time to care, there is nothing to care about.  Equanimity is balance in the present moment.  It's always free from suffering.  Indifference is more like a defense mechanism.  \"I could care about getting my homework done but homework is stressful to me, so instead I'm going to ignore it.\"  In this example indifference leads to procrastination.  Equanimity would be doing your homework and the process of doing the homework is not stressful.\n\nI love this, and it's really resonating with me now as someone who expends care like a charity to everyone.\n\nHow can I learn how to adapt to this? Do you have anything to recommend so maybe I could read to learn more?\n\nYou can learn The Noble Eightfold Path and apply its teachings.  All of its teachings should increase equanimity.  If a teaching doesn't it's probably misunderstood.\n\ni dont care vs it's all good\n\n&gt;meditation helps you get a break from caring by reducing the importance of the self and getting you to accept the state of the world\n\nTrue. And at times I struggle with this. I don‚Äôt want my better understanding (such as it is) of why we‚Äôre here and my increased ability to accept reality to become an excuse for not reaching deeper to access more compassion. It can be a bit of a conundrum at times.\n\nFrom my experience, it hasn‚Äôt actually diminished my caring. It has actually made it much easier to care once I can have some ability to not let it overtake me.\n\nAgreed. I‚Äôm thinking about times where I‚Äôm watching the news, say, and some disaster is being covered. I sometimes find myself mentally stepping back and seeing the victims‚Äô awful experience as part of the inevitable cosmic dance.\n\nIt‚Äôs at these times like these (sometimes) that I have to remind myself that I need to (re)look into my heart while maintaining the cosmic perspective, as it is possible to just be accepting at the macro level and (mostly) pay less attention to the individual suffering.\n\nI think that life is constantly pleasant. If you‚Äôre aware enough.\n\nI agree with you &amp; OP equally.\n\nPerfectly balanced as all things must be.\n\nAs all things *are*, even if we are unaware.\n\nLife is change.\n\nDisagree, you need contrast to be able to appreciate pleasantry. There are down times. However, you can go through them with a certain gentleness that never seems to stop getting even softer. So there's something to be said about being aware enough yes. But there are fluctuations. And it's not always pleasant.\n\nThis is exactly it. There is no light without dark. Approaching them with resistance never works in your favor. Gentleness is the way.\n\nCame here to say this. Life is basically constant love if you‚Äôre aware enough. \n\nOf course we all dip into grief and anxiety and humanly emotions, but I find that I can find an underlying feeling of love for the full spectrum of the human experience. Even in the heavier feelings.\n\nYeah it really depends on what you're focusing on\n\nlife itself is a struggle and this feels like anxiety or other daily stress. no one really knows what to do.¬†\n\none can be aware and turn it around and make it a happy experience but only after becoming aware of the pain but also having the creative energy to want to be happy despite the pain and this effort turns things around temporarily for a while until you again feel the pain of being alive.¬†\n\nThere's a stark difference between suffering from entertaining the illusion of separateness in duality and authentic Being-in-the-world as this ecstatic unity. Look up eudaimonic happiness for the good life to truly flourish.\n\nthe reason life is pain is because everything is in motion, there is no solid material in our universe everything is moving, consuming, regenerating, there‚Äôs a war going on inside each of us where our cells are constantly consuming other cells and new ones being created, this conflict in the physical and mental level feels like an anxiety that every single person that exists will feel. to exist is a form of defiance of non existence and that is like flipping the bird to nothingness, the defiance is what causes us to be so angry about something we can‚Äôt even comprehend.¬†\n\nanxiety is a healthy word, if you can feel it for what it is without projecting problems onto it or societal expectations, past experience or future projections.¬†\n\nit‚Äôs all very feeling level stuff and not things you can easily put into words¬†\n\n&gt;- \"The moment you know your real Being, you are afraid of nothing. Death gives freedom and power. To be free in the world, you must die to the world.\" - Nisargadatta Maharaj, I Am That\n\n&gt; - \"I have gradually come to one negative conclusion about the good life. It seems to me that the good life is not any fixed state. It is not, in my estimation, a state of virtue, or contentment, or nirvana, or happiness. It is not a condition in which the individual is adjusted or fulfilled or actualized. To use psychological terms, it is not a state of drive reduction, or tension-reduction, or homeostasis. [...] The good life is a process, not a state of being. It is a direction not a destination.\" - (Carl Rogers, Person to person: The problem of being human: A new trend in psychology 1967, p. 185-187)\n\nIt's good that everything is in constant motion. If it weren't, life would be unbearable. Solids break with change. Liquids thrive. If you do like water and flow, you will enjoy the ride.\n\nOP is in the intermediate state, \\^ this is where you get to \"if you are aware enough\".\n\nI‚Äôm more enlightened and humble than any of you.\n\nIt‚Äôs more like pleasant and suffering lose their forms.\n\nI think awareness gives us a choice. For example: when it rains, it's your choice to be upset or feel joyful or be neutral.\nThrough awareness we know what we are choosing and why.\n\nAwareness is the best refuge from suffering. I like this refuge and bodhicitta monlam a lot:\n\nWith a wish for all beings to be free,  \nFree of the contraction and constriction of held belief systems, and thought patterns  \nFree of the automatic reactivity of held emotional patterns  \nAnd free of distorted perceptions  \n**I will always go for refuge to alive, vibrant, radiant, spacious awareness**  \n**Until awareness is ongoing, like the flow of a river.**  \n  \nEnthused by wisdom and compassion,  \nToday, in the presence of all Buddhas and Bodhisattvas of any lineage and time, or none  \nI generate the mind for full awakening.  \nFor the benefit of all beings.  \n  \nAs long as space remains  \nAs long as beings remain,  \nMay I manifest in such a way to ease, and dispel the miseries in the universe.\n\nStress is not necessarily suffering so you're making a judgemental assumption from the start there.\n\nYes it is. How is stress enjoyable?¬†\n\njust because something isn't enjoyable doesn't mean it's suffering. placing a value judgment on your stress and resisting or obsessing over it causes suffering.\n\nedit: spelling\n\nStress is neutral you say? Neither good nor bad?¬†\n\nCan certainly be. Unpleasant doesn't mean suffering. Pain and suffering are not the same thing. There is also a type of stress which is positive, and we can be happy to be in it. It has a name I forget, but essentially when we feel in control, that type of stress actually compells us.\n\nYou might say \"I'm suffering from this hurt foot\", but that's really a semantic thing. Surely you've had experiences where something was painful, but not enough to bother you so you were fine?\n\nyeah I would say so. stress is a natural response to excessive stimuli and can also be a reaction to a loss of control. like most other feelings, it's a signal meant to alert you about your needs -- ie you're doing too much and need to find opportunities to unwind. or you care a lot about something and it's not going the way you've hoped. In a culture of productivity and social isolation stress is going to be higher, but it doesn't have to be suffering\n\nthis!\n\n&gt;How is stress enjoyable?¬†\n\nNot anywhere in the definition of suffering, or lack of suffering, is enjoyment needed or not.\n\nI didn't say stress was enjoyable. I said stress doesn't need to be suffering.\n\nWhy would you choose to perceive that meaning when my words do not match what you've said? \n\nWhy bring such  judgement here?\n\nthe Buddha said life is suffering . It is the first truth in the 4 noble truths.¬†\n\nWhat would you say about that?¬†\n\nAnecdotally - my life isn't suffering so this truth already isn't some universal truth\n\nI wouldn't get attached to something a guy maybe said 4000 years ago, then wasn't actually written down until 500 years after his death.\n\nChallenge everything in your life. \"When you meet the Buddha, kill him.\"\n\nPeople sometimes take things too literal. Suffering is unavoidable in life, that is the truth. And the Buddha taught how to skilfully deal with this suffering.\n\nIf you would describe your existence as suffering, then it‚Äôs clear you have more work to do. So I agree with you on that.\n\nI don't think the Buddha would agree with OP either. If you‚Äôre skilful with your thoughts and emotions and have done the work. Then the majority of your day to day existence should be pleasant.\n\nYou seem to be unfamiliar with Nirodha? It is the third truth. \n\nReductavism doesn't work on the four truths, they all have to be considered as a whole. \n\nSo to you I would say. Buddha said many things which you are not considering as a whole.\n\nmountainous deserve zealous jeans roof lunchroom hunt shelter label insurance\n\n *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev/home)*\n\nVinegar tastes like vinegar.\n\n*smiles\n\n&gt; Vinegar tastes like vinegar\n\ntasty, tasty vinegar\n\nIf you are aware enough, you get past the state you're describing.  Keep going, you're not as aware as you think you are.\n\nAgreed with this.\n\nOP could be in the dark night of the soul.\n\nI still got a lot of work to do if that‚Äôs the case\n\nChop wood, carry water.\n\n[deleted]\n\nThere was a thread here saying the Buddha never said that\n\n[deleted]\n\n&gt;suffering is inherent to life (as a human) and that there is a path to liberation from that suffering.\n\nI remember reading somewhere recently that the wording of Four Noble Truths followed a pattern of exposition common at the time, something like:\n\n1. We know there‚Äôs a problem\n\n2. We know the cause of that problem\n\n3. We have a solution to that problem\n\n4. Here‚Äôs the solution\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/dqiloq/the\\_buddha\\_never\\_said\\_life\\_is\\_suffering/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/dqiloq/the_buddha_never_said_life_is_suffering/)\n\n293+ likes and 100,000+ views would disagree with you\n\nAre you suggesting a minority (only 300?) and ‚Äòviews‚Äô equate to the truth?¬†\n\nThe top comment of that thread instantly debunks the OP.¬†\n\n[deleted]\n\nTextual purists will always want to bicker over linguistic specifics, not seeming to understand the futility of trying to accurately convey the original intent of someone who lived in another culture hundreds of years ago. \n\nThe best we will ever have is very educated approximations, to which we then unconsciously apply *our* cultural context, often incorrectly.\n\nBesides, it all misses the point. The words are not the answer. They just point to it.\n\nIt could be they were referring to a mistranslation?\n\nThe first noble truth is commonly mistranslated as \"life is suffering\", but a more accurate translation is, \"This is suffering.\" or \"There is suffering.\"  Referring to the context where when someone is stressed out and having a bad day someone says to them, \"That stress you're experiencing, that is what suffering is.\"\n\nThe remaining noble truths are the beginning of the path to ending suffering.  No more stress in the present moment.  A cure to get rid of that, if you want to.\n\nNot everyone has an anxiety disorder, but you're not far off OP.  The majority of people do have unnecessary anxiety.  Alcohol is popular at parties because it reduces anxiety.  When you don't have anxiety alcohol no longer seems necessary to enjoy yourself.\n\nEquanimity, often seen as a high goal of meditation, you don't have suffering in that moment.  No anxiety disorders, no depression, no stress from anything else.  Just a chill present moment.\n\nI drink alcohol, I am a little introverted, and have social anxiety, uh fancy words for something such normal and understandable.\nIt really helps and I took it for normal state of human being.\nBut some 8 years ago something happened to me, fear fell off completely, I was much more emphatic, and strong if needed, much easier to switch states etc etc, the point here that I can attest that I didn't need alcohol to get loose or be extroverted, then alcohol even had an opposite effect, makes you less aware, less here, it is great to be fearless, in good feeling and very much present. But that is gone, it was some demo version...\nThat is why I am into this stuff , trying to get that back or know what the hell happened, but now knowing that it can be so much better it is actually worse than before.\n\n&gt; But that is gone, it was some demo version...\n\nMeditation can temporarily bring you to new mental states.  To make them permanent you need to analyze the processes within your mind and then find alternative processes to replace those old ones with.  That's what all growth is.  Changing things like social anxiety is more of a habit change, it's quite deep and can be sticky habits that take a lot of analysis to figure out.\n\nFor me, which may not apply to you, my anxiety was making incorrect negative predictions of the future.  When I started writing down my predictions and then going back and double checking to see if they were true I learned where my predictions went wrong.  I then started predicting the future better.  Now I only get anxiety when I'm actually in danger.  (Keeping in mind that an anxiety disorder is unnecessary anxiety.  There should be anxiety and fight or flight if e.g. you see a venomous sneak out in the wilderness).\n\nThx, I tried various stuff, meditation, yoga (not just any but very good online live course, because 95 percent of yoga classes are far away from original teachings). \nI am not consistent with meditation, and even in my experience that is most important.\nFor the time I was consistent there were small changes,  but small.\nThat demo version was very good, so many things better that I would train maybe for years, from my confidence, to feeling people, or influence people like super powers.\nDaniel Ingram calls that A&amp;P event.\nIt was good enough to have motivation to do practice but unfortunately to no avail.\nWe will see....\n\nWell, with that attitude.\n\nYour last sentence is absolutely correct and the opening sentence is absolutely wrong.\n\nBoth the sentences are contradictory to each other; self is not ego, self is ever happiness and ego is pain.\n\n\"I notice some people who claim to be doing good but then they do something like bite their nails which suggest that they have stress they are unaware of. \"\n\nSo you're saying people can't be doing good if they have unaware stress?\n\nI think OP meant ‚Äúdoing well‚Äù.\n\nSee, kids? This is why grammar matters.\n\n&gt;I notice some people who claim¬†to be doing good but then they do something like bite their nails which suggest that they have stress they¬†are unaware of.\n\nStress does not equal suffering, just to be clear. \n\nNot sure what you mean by the self is tension. You can also be aware without self. I disagree with this post. Suffering is not caused by awareness inherently at all.\n\nWhat about if I have plenty of sleep, exercise, good food, and feel fantastic?\n\nOTOH, ignorance is bliss.\n\nI don't think you quite understand suffering. There are the 4 Noble Truths of Buddhism: there is suffering, suffering is due to craving, there is a path out of suffering, here it is.\n\nAnd if one is even more aware still, they will observe that all suffering is emergent from the brain and not emergent from the mind. \n\nNot emergent from the point of observation. \n\nBe the observer and not the reactant. Just a little further to go. \n\nSafe travels.\n\nIt's a POV\n\nThat‚Äôs what Buddhism is all about. Life is suffering. Escape it.\n\nEmbrace it.\n\nThe Buddhist suffering has more in common with \"withdrawal\" than \"anguish.\"\n\nIt's not the pain itself that woes us, but rather the fear of being taken from adequacy and into discomfort.\n\nAll souls float in the sea of chaos aboard moldy driftwood.\n\nYou may choose to tense up, swallow your spit and turn your gaze as the next onslaught of the deep ravages your body, grinds salt into your skin and eyes, and freezes you to your core.\n\nOr you can embrace the inevitable. You may let the tides toil unto you, for they shall go nowhere else. You shall go nowhere else.\n\nPerhaps, even, in the equaninity of the freezing cold, you may set your sights not on the next big waves, but the next closest souls floating around you. Set your gaze so that you may push yourself closer to them.\n\nSo that you may\n\nembrace them.\n\nThis is true only if you haven't yet learned to focus your awareness on those things that don't cause suffering. :)\n\nThat's Buddha's first Noble Truth. It's worth reading about The Four Noble Truths, even if it's just on wiki.\n\nI think you‚Äôre wrong for equating happiness with a lack of tension.\n\nI think an argument can be made that the point of life is to minimize suffering.\n\nNo it isn‚Äôt.\n\nThe suffering comes from friction when we label things as good or bad.. on the exterior but even more so within. \n\nThings like the ‚Äúself‚Äù the ‚Äúego‚Äù are thought processes that you can see beyond once you are aware enough actually.\n\nthe more awareness the less suffering there is actually\n\nThat‚Äôs why there is beer &amp; football‚Ä¶to drown out the awareness of suffering and experience happiness\n\nYou can find what ever you look for here. Seek and you shall find. Just be glad you didn‚Äôt wake up in Gaza Strip.\n\nYou can have as much clarity as humanly possible but still be at the mercy of your perspective. If you cut your own suffering in half, you‚Äôll just be at someone else‚Äôs baseline amount of suffering. They won‚Äôt know the difference but you will. If your life feels like suffering there‚Äôs no reason to ‚Äútough it out‚Äù just try to get out of what‚Äôs causing you pain. There‚Äôs technically just as much joy and productivity and connection out there, if u stop bein a edgelordüëπ\n\nCute\n\nTo be clear, I meant that to be directed at OP lol. Idk what I‚Äôm doing in this sub I don‚Äôt even meditate\n\nOn the contrary, life is incredibly beautiful if you're aware enough.  Look around you and appreciate the little things.  Enjoy every autumn leaf.  Enjoy every note of every piece of music.  Enjoy every second of laughter.   Every day is a gift.  Every friend is a gift.  Every sandwich is a gift.  Every moment that you are alive is a gift.  Someday you will be dead.  So appreciate the millions of tiny beautiful moments of your life while you are still alive.  \n\n  \nLife is not constant suffering.  Life is constant beauty.\n\nA wonderful comment. Thank you for this.\n\nThere's a reason why they say ignorance is bliss. Also, pain is inevitable but suffering is optional. View pain and suffering as just another component of life, just like happiness is.\n\nNo reason to get attached to it and let it define your self worth. Success and failure are both treacherous.\n\nIgnorance is bliss, until it isn't. Integrating the ego through our self-awareness to be an ecstasy as this ecstatic unity is what brings the least neuroticism and the most satisfaction without it disappearing from choosing our own attitude -- choosing our own way -- for intrinsic fulfillment, contentment, peace, and delight. Without self-awareness this wouldn't be possible to be transcendent for the direct experience itself.\n\nChasing fleeting experiences/pleasure (focusing on hedonic drives) and living through externals like objects and people contingently, instead of directly through our own life's flow itself, is what always leaves one feeling unsatisfied afterward.\n\nEdit: clarification\n\nOnly in case you are resisting what is being perceived within and without. In case you are open to it, willing to acknowledge whatever easy or hard, and flow with it. Then it is great.\n\nyou have to make a side step: the incoming signal  is still the same, the way you treat the signal, not.\n\nWhy you write like you discovered something brand new? Yes it‚Äôs the nature of the ego, welcome to the club!! Our minds try to keep us safe so it constantly produces thoughts, what ifs etc. If you live by your mind (ego) you just survive. If you live by your heart (true self), you live, experience. Life is about being conscious of the mind flow and to not let yourself be controlled by mind but drive with your heart as much as you can meanwhile removing blockages you have as conditioning and limiting beliefs which prevents hearing your heart voice. I am tired of hearing life is constant suffering, life is full of pain but suffering is a choice once you bring consciousness to unconscious.\n\nThat's interesting, but is it always? No moments of joy?\n\nA high level of awareness can have a positive, neutral, or negative valence. You are having an awareness of negativity within yourself that you have not been able to resolve yet. The awareness of it is the first step. \n\nThe positive version of anxiety is excitement/eagerness, and the positive version of depression is serenity. That high arousal state (‚Äústress‚Äù, ‚Äúanxiety‚Äù, ‚Äúeagerness‚Äù, ‚Äúexcitement‚Äù) signals to your body to take action. It is a functional signal, and if you regularly ignore it, you will probably feel anxious, because you are either neglecting your needs in some way or putting too many demands on yourself. \n\nIs there something you are putting off or neglecting? Like physical exercise, doing something good for your community, socializing, organizing your space, making healthy meals, getting morning sun, stretching, a creative outlet, etc? If you are busy all day engaging in a fulfilling array of activities, then when it‚Äôs time to rest, you will likely be at peace. \n\nHowever, anxiety could also arise for reasons related to trauma, like if you were never ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù for your parents/they emotionally abused you.. in which case the anxiety might be your inner child crying out for the validation it never received. Healing from that kind of pain requires gentle self-compassion, an understanding that your worth isn‚Äôt contingent on anyone‚Äôs approval. Once you begin to unpack these emotional roots, you‚Äôll find that even heightened awareness can become a tool for growth, rather than a source of suffering.\n\n(There are other potential causes of anxiety such as OCD or narcissism. All causes of anxiety can be addressed by the following treatment *(not guaranteed to be resolved permanently. Could be temporary + provide insight into the root of the anxiety and how to go about resolving it gradually)*.\n\nI‚Äôd recommend candyflipping (~150 mcg acid + 120mg MDMA taken 3-4 hours into the acid trip). I have trip-sitted for 8 people who tried it, and they all had beautiful transformational therapeutic experiences. \n\nDuring your trip, you will experience immense love and empathy for yourself and others and you will likely be able to experience a high level of awareness with no anxiety. You might realize that you used to project negativity onto objects, animals, or people. You might realize you felt negativity towards yourself. You might realize you focused your attention on trivial things, or assumed people were judging you when they were not. You could also realize your procrastination was related to negative perceptions. There‚Äôs a good chance that these negative perceptions will go away (possibly permanently or at least for awhile) after your trip. \n\nEven one person I tripsitted who didn‚Äôt have the main liver enzyme to metabolize mdma and only got waves of smaller doses still had insane realizations and positive changes in their personality. In her case, many of the changes faded over the following few months, but in other cases the changes have stuck (6 months later so far). I would not recommend doing it more than once a year, and you may only want to do it once in your life, particularly if you have a lot of experience with meditation and will continue to meditate regularly. \n\nI HIGHLY recommend watching this 30 minute mettannealing meditation/breathwork playlist, a week prior to the trip as well as every day for at least a month after your trip. Go to Andres Gomez Emilsson‚Äôs YT channel -&gt; playlists -&gt; Mettannealing\n\nMake sure to follow Rollsafe.org protocols and preferably do it with a loved one.\n\nIn the Matrix Agent Smith told Morpheus that reality is a nightmare we‚Äôre all trying to wake up from.

Or maybe it is habit?\n\nit's an endless fight against chaos :)\n\neverything takes energy or it turns to shit. constant refining and ordering. the only way is to acknowledge it and do what you need to do, learning to enjoy the process and have gratitude for what you have.\n\nThe ego is not worth concerning so much. Everyone is stuck thinking personally and making all about the self\n\nThe self is hell, but that‚Äôs not the only show in town. Even while there is pain there can also be delight. There can be delight because there is suffering. Without it, no one would ever find their way home.\n\nThere's ignorance, which it sounds like you view as a vehicle for happiness.\n\nThere's the onset of awareness, which can form tension, anxiety, and other resistive energies.\n\nThrough the process of self discovery, acceptance, and growth is where the good stuff is, on the other side of those tensions.\n\nHey! This is the best place to be, if you actually want to Wake Up. \n\nThis recognition of suffering is the first noble truth of Buddhism. ‚ÄúLife is Dukkha‚Äù \n\nFrom here, the disre to be out of suffering can drive you to shed the identity that causes it. \n\nOr,\nYou stay here, aware of the suffering.

What helps me now is to not try too hard to see life as a blessing or positive but accept that it‚Äôs imperfect but yet you wanna enjoy it when you can!\n\nI think Joseph Cambel (spelled wrong) put it well, that one can walk the line between compassion and detachment. The detachment part seems central of the idea is that life is suffering, speaking in somewhat Buddhist terms. Helps me a great deal. And to borrow from Shakespeare- Life is neither good nor bad; it is thought that makes it so. \nI think therefore mayhem!\n\nsimply put, suffering is misidentification\n\nchoose to stop when you're ready or don't\n\nNo, it‚Äôs constant suffering if you ARENT aware enough. This is the entire point.¬†\n\nLife is what you make it.\n\nbut at some point you can have full awareness and also no more judgement of things as positive and negative. you can know but see it as neutral.\n\nSeems like you have become attached to your expanded perspective of suffering. This notion completely ignores the duality of pain and pleasure. The highest high will also be unsatisfactory in the end but the high itself is devoid of suffering.\n\nI think it depends on how you frame it unconsciously or not, it‚Äôs impossible to account for all of your subconscious and at all times. The people I‚Äôve seen bite their nails because of current dilemmas that they haven‚Äôt conquered like my partner with trying to get a loan for an example. If you frame it as gratitude for what you do have when it‚Äôs not forced and acceptance for what feelings come naturally more importantly I think suffering is natural but partially avoidable in its abundance.\n\nArmchair bhuddists always stop at the \"life is suffering\" part of the four noble truths. But that's still wrong view, a view of discrimination where you see suffering and bliss as two separate things. \n \nGo deeper into the 4 noble truths and you will see that suffering and bliss are a pair of opposites, intrinsically linked with one another. One cannot exist without the other. There is not suffering alone, as there is not bliss alone. \n \nYour self is in tension with itself because you have not fully let go into the views of non-discrimination, impermanence, equanimity, and acceptance. Life is more than just suffering, but you must have the courage to look into suffering deeply to be able to see the truth\n\nI mean to me it is quite the opposite.\n\nI suppose problems lose meaning when you've lost everything anyway.\n\n... and then you drop the ego and become bliss\n\nIgnorance is bliss. But you have the choice to stop caring.¬†\n\nDisagree.. I do believe life has tons of pain. Pain is unavoidable it helps us grow and evolve. However suffering is only something that happens when we get lost in our mind. For example.. I‚Äôll feel pain if it turns out my best friend is a psychopath‚Ä¶ however I‚Äôll only suffer if I dwell on that in my mind. If I say to myself‚Äùwhat‚Äôs wrong with me why would I choose someone like that as a friend.‚Äù Pain is inevitable but suffering is something we choose. We put ourselves down with our thoughts, I believe once you choose to embrace pain.. see it as an opportunity for growth.. there really is very little if any at all suffering. But to each their own (:\n\nSilence fills sounds\nStillness fills changing\nEmptiness fills understanding \n\nThe Tao finds itself"

    "body": "And why didn't anyone tell me this would improve my pickleball score? Apparently meditation can lead to an up to 10% increase in reaction times!!\n\nBeen meditating on and off for a few years, got more into it after I got sober. 14 months later I relapsed, and it's been a struggle but let me say mindfulness and meditation are the only thing that got me through the withdrawals.\n\nI've been meditating ever day during my lunch break for about two weeks, and I had this wild moment: for whatever reason, I decided to lean into my anxiety instead of trying to push it away or shut it down. I had flashes of all the things making me anxious for about five minutes, it was really uncomfortable but I realized that I just hadn't processed any of the problems I'm dealing with recently.\n\nThat's when I realized I've been pushing every emotion down as much as possible for *years*. The real kicker? I've known I tend to push down anxiety, but didn't realize it's *every emotion*. And like a bad burp, by holding it I gave myself a constantly upset spiritual stomach (honestly the best analogy I can make for it lol).\n\nEver since then, I've just been going with the flow of my thoughts and emotions, but not reacting. I feel like I'm literally riding a wave and it's amazing! I haven't felt this good in years.\n\nMy question to you, fellow mediators, is this: am I just experiencing a \"breakthrough high\" right now, or is it really possible to be aware enough of emotions to be able to move past them?\n\n(by move past them I mean carrying out an action  even if it's contrary to the predominant emotion regarding said action. It's something I typically struggle with). ",

    "all_comment_text": "Before you heal someone, ask him if he‚Äôs willing to give up the things that make him sick.\n\n\nHippocrates\n\nNot sure I agree. Sometimes healing someone or a part of someone can give them the breathing room to change the rest of their life.\n\nDefine healing. Healing is relative. What would be good for a cancer patient, perhaps chemo medications, would be disastrous for someone who doesn‚Äôt have that affliction. Probably could have used a better example, but im low on time rn\n\nOnly if that‚Äôs what they want.\n\nYou cannot heal someone who doesn't allow it to happen. For one: You should always allow someone a choice before you do something altering to them, and second: they will actively fight back.\n\nWe‚Äôre not talking about whether someone wants to heal or not. We‚Äôre talking about having to wait for someone to stop harming to begin healing. Which I don‚Äôt think is a requirement. \n\nFor example, giving someone grace when they are self inflicting is a form of healing even though they haven‚Äôt stopped hurting themselves.\n\nYou will not be able to help someone who doesn't want it. That's the point dude. It doesn't matter how great of a friend I am to someone who cannot stop thinking about offing themselves because they don't want help, they want to die. It's an extreme example of course. Being a decent person to someone isn't \"healing\" them.\n\nYeah but he never took his own advice\n\nwhat a hippocrate\n\nYou're a sponge, ready to absorb everything around you. Your body is a culmination of receptors, and they will pull any and all information available. If you don't learn to control these receivers, you'll find that you're addicted to what's outside of you and let your body autonomously feed this addiction. Once you stop and realize what you're doing and what you are, you'll find that line between you and everything else, and how you and everything else are actually one thing working in chorus.\n\nI want to learn/read more about this concept of the self being a sponge of receptors. Does that make our inputs what we are? Like you are what you intake in the forms of feeding desires or something?\n\nLet's find out.\n\nNo. You are only that you are. That's who you are. \"I am that I am\"\n\nYou aren't your body, you aren't your brain, you aren't your actions, you are a spiritual pilot exploring life with a meat suit.\n\nthis might sound silly but how do you meditate? i try to clear my mind and just ground myself, but i feel as if i don‚Äôt gain any benefits from that :(\n\nMeditation isn‚Äôt about clearing your mind. You can‚Äôt do that. \n\nThis is the best beginner explanation imo: https://youtu.be/4PkrhH-bkpk?si=PpXpiLpg5AJyWbfD\n\nThe Buddha was the greatest meditator of all time and provides [the following instructions in the ƒÅnƒÅpƒÅnassatisutta (mindfulness of breathing sutta)](https://suttacentral.net/mn118/en/sujato?lang=en&amp;layout=sidebyside&amp;reference=none&amp;notes=asterisk&amp;highlight=false&amp;script=latin):\n\n&gt; It‚Äôs when a mendicant‚Äîgone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut‚Äîsits down cross-legged, sets their body straight, and establishes mindfulness in their presence. Just mindful, they breathe in. Mindful, they breathe out.\n\nSo find a quiet place ideally away from human noises and sit straight. Then choose a meditation subject, a common one is the rising and falling of the breath. And just observe the natural breath without changing anything to it. If the mind wanders, bring it back. Don't scold the mind, just like training a puppy, be gentle and kind and firm.\n\nThen\n\n&gt; It‚Äôs when a mendicant develops the awakening factors of mindfulness, investigation of principles, energy, rapture, tranquility, immersion, and equanimity, which rely on seclusion, fading away, and cessation, and ripen as letting go. That‚Äôs how the seven awakening factors, when developed and cultivated, fulfill knowledge and freedom.\n\nknowledge and freedom will fulfill.\n\n\"the greatest meditator of all time\" sounds like a bizzare statement.\n\nWhy? I got it from [The Seven Stages of Purification](https://www.piandeiciliegi.it/images/docs-pdf/Matara_Sri_Nanarama_TheSevenStagesOfPurification.pdf) by the late Venerable Matara Sri Mah√†thera,  one of the most\nrespected meditation masters of present-day Sri\nLanka. He wrote in Appendex 1:\n\n&gt;e Call to the Meditative Life\nThe intrinsic value of the life of a meditative\nmonk is beyond estimation. There are various\nmarvellous ways of life in this world. But there\ncan hardly be a more marvellous way of life than\nthat of a meditative monk. When you come to\nthink about this, you have reason to congratu-\nlate yourself on taking up this way of life. This\nlife of a meditative monk is not only invaluable,\nbut pure and clean. All the other marvellous\nways of life in this world are concerned with\nexternal things. They have to do with things\nexternal ‚Äî with external mechanics. The life of\na meditator, on the other hand, is concerned\nwith the internal mechanics ‚Äî the mechanics of\nmind-control. The Buddha was the greatest\nmeditator of all times. The life of the meditative\nmonk originated with him. The birth of a\nBuddha is an extremely rare phenomenon in the\nworld. Not all who listen to his Dhamma take to\nthis life of meditation; only a few of them take\nup the meditative life in earnest. Be happy that\nyou are counted among these fortunate few.\n\nSeems like an impossible thing to know. How could anyone know who the \"greatest\" meditator of all time is? \n\nWho defines the quality of a meditation anyway?\n\nWhy don‚Äôt more people diet? They would look better and feel better. Why don‚Äôt people do yoga everyday? They would look better and feel better. Ignorance/ laziness/ self contemp/ fulfilling the role of others.\n\nOr trauma that makes you so disconnected from your self, that you seek out things that make you feel good so you can at least somewhat feel like a normal human being.\n\nThat's why people love watching TV specifically crime shows. They feel a certain satisfaction that their lives are not as bad as the lives portrayed in those crime shows.\n\nThat's really interesting thank you for sharing it makes alot of sense!\n\nthis makes sense thank you, also for this perspective. i always wondered why people, past friends and such were obsessed with true crime and would try to get me to watch-however im far to empathetic to watch others and hear of others hurting. i never got what about those shows captures such large audiences- i appreciate this new perspective :)\n\nIt also doesn't work the same way for everybody. When i try to meditate, I dissociate and hear voices. It's hard to meditate through that, though I do find it useful to get in touch with my subconscious.\n\nYou make it sound like you see your voices as problems / distractions from meditation. Have you considered that observing these voices and allowing them to be as is IS meditation? Meditation isn't meant to distract you from stuff and meditate \"through\" (or despite) that, but to engage and dissolve stuff like this. Otherwise you're doing spiritual bypassing.\n\n(I obviously don't know you / your mind state so take it with a grain of salt)\n\nI don't actually see them as problems. I see them as distinct entities within me that have their own problems and emotions, and even experiences. This particular voice pushes me away whenever I try to connect.  She literally yells, \"Stop trying to hurt me!\" I'm working with a really good psychologist who advises me to validate it, but hearing the voices jars me out and spikes my heart rate. It's not just uncomfortable, it's actually really scary. Walking into that fear didn't dissolve it for me; it did land me in the hospital with a very tenuous grip on reality for a while, though. \n\nMy main point is only that not everybody can meditate the way OP does. I think it's really cool what s/he was able to do. People prone to dissociation can have very different experiences than those who don't easily dissociate. And dissociation/ dissociative tendencies are not the norm,  but also not uncommon. Mindfulness and meditation is a really useful way for me to connect with myself, with my voices, but I have to go slow and respect my own limits.\n\nAt the same time why should people ‚Äúlook better‚Äù because someone else wants them to ‚Äúlook better‚Äù? \n\nWe should work on ourself and on being our best self and allow others to be or do whatever they feel like doing as long as it does not harm anyone. And, being ‚Äúour best self‚Äù looks different for everyone, and depends on a individuals view of what their best self should be like. \n\nWhat people do or cease to do is really up to them. Is it not? \n\nI just feel like people are to busy judging what others do or don‚Äôt do that they forget to work on themselves.\n\nNo one said anything about them looking better for someone else.  In fact, OP even said some people avoid eating healthier *because* it‚Äôs being forced by others.  Anyways,   It‚Äôs well established and known that eating healthier (which can include a type of dieting) and exercising/yoga makes you look and feel better.\n\nGreat achievement. I am very grateful that you shared this experience.\n\n\n\nThis is exactly what it is about, releasing all emotions, because they are our memory of pain and suffering, which blocks us and programs us in everyday decisions.\n\n\n\nFrom what you wrote, I gather that you are still dazzled by what you have discovered in yourself, that is the fantastic thing about it all.\n\n\n\nI went through a similar process, but I have not released everything yet. Because you are still stuck in this reality, new negative stimuli will constantly flow in. But you will be more resistant to their influence, because you have built your own experience of how to free yourself from it.\n\nI wish you good luck with all my heart on your path, keep going.\n\nThat sounds wonderful. Congratulations. This too shall pass. Chop wood, carry water.\n\nYou've discovered discursive thought and its power over our experience. Most people believe they think for themselves. But then when one meditates, all that looping, involuntary thinking is seen. We realize that we live in a compulsive fantasy.\n\nIt's not that you need to \"process\" your anxieties. In Buddhist view, which is where most meditation is borrowed from, discursive thought and conflicting emotions are the dual supports of egoic grasping. We keep them going in order to feel purpose and to confirm self. I other words, anxiety is not attacking you. It's not a volume of muck to be cleaned out by talking to a therapist or some such. You're keeping it cooking in order to feel alive.\n\nWhen you see that and calm the mind somewhat, you can have experiences known as nyams. Bliss, luminosity and non-thought. Or non-anxiety, clarity and quiet mind. You could say they're the non-tainted versions of passion, aggression and ignorance -- the 3 poisons. Experiencing those things is a case of temporary side effects. They're a good sign that you're doing it right, but they're not the goal. If you cling to them you'll \"crash\" when the high fades.\n\nHowever, what you've experienced is not just a high. As you noted, to see these things is to be less attached. You see the emotion rather than being completely absorbed in it. That's the beginning of equanimity, which doesn't mean moving past or getting rid of emotions but rather being able to feel them without needing to indulge, repress, reject, etc.\n\n\"If you cling to them you'll \"crash\" when the high fades\".\n\nThat's exactly where I am right now. I was stoked when I realized that even though creating room to accept and endure anxiety and emotional pain was extremely overwhelming and terrifying, I made it to the other side of the experience and process. What I didn't realize is how quickly what I was able to process would be replaced by even more overwhelm and frickin terror. That was really demoralizing if I'm honest üíî. \n\nI really appreciate you putting words to this experience. It's such a great reminder that the goal has never been to never feel...or to reach this ultimate state of uninfluenced homeostasis,  but instead, to remember that balance is actually an action....a verb, not a noun in a sense. We WILL get thrown off by external stimuli, therefore the goal is to learn to allow the emotions to pass through every time we are stimulated in that way opposed to absorbing them. Clutch. Thank you üß°\n\nYes it is totally possible to maintain awareness and not be swept away by your emotions. It takes consistent practice. Keep it up\n\nIt sounds like you've really tapped into something powerful with your meditation practice. Leaning into those uncomfortable feelings can be so liberating it's like you‚Äôre finally giving yourself permission to feel. And yes, it is possible to be aware of your emotions and move past them!\n\nSounds like you found a very efficient method of healing\n\nWhen my dad was young, if someone was running on the sidewalk, you assumed something was wrong.\n\nThe West's ego problems cannot be understated. It's the source of nearly every problem. Just a half century ago, exercise in the US was weird.\n\nBuddhism is the best solution to these problems but until I educated my dad, he still thought Buddha was fat. If you could put Buddhism in a pill, it would be more popular than ozembic\n\nYes! Especially to pickleball. I noticed significant improvement too.\n\nHey brother, I‚Äôve been dealing with this exact revelation. I‚Äôve realised that I have been repressing all my emotions for my entire life, but I haven‚Äôt reached the point where I feel like I can do anything with this insight. Do you have any tips on this? You said you just lean into the emotions that come up?\n\nCan you explain how you start the process\n\nYou're a sponge, ready to absorb everything around you. Your body is a culmination of receptors, and they will pull any and all information available. If you don't learn to control these receivers, you'll find that you're addicted to what's outside of you and let your body autonomously feed this addiction. Once you stop and realize what you're doing and what you are, you'll find that line between you and everything else, and how you and everything else are actually one thing working in chorus.\n\nThat is highly possible with moment to moment awareness. :)\n\nOcd and adhd for me, i try sometimes though\n\nSame as workout, it takes a lot of time and energy to achieve results\n\nI totally agree. I've done Inner Matrix Systems meditations for years and it's truly changed my life. It's really amazing what we can train the mind to focus on\n\nYou need to read David Hawkins. He explains exactly this\n\nThere will come a point (assuming you stay consistent and actually advance) where you will be in full control of your emotions. This is the natural way.\n\nMost people don't meditate because \n\nA - they refer to the false concept society has handed them, which puts them off\nB - their ego pretending to be their self stops them\n\nMeditation will always remain a  rare skill ,with few folks practicing it. It has been like that since it's inception because it is a spiritual exercise that requires attention and focus. Those two skills are sadly lacking in humanity and people won't give up their cell phone or fiddling with the internet, to be still and  meditate. Most people require more and more input, instead of less and less, that  is our true awareness system.\n\nThis is a genuine experience and you SHOULD lean into this.\n\nlook at how much text you wrote and you ‚Äúthink‚Äù you‚Äôve figured it out so just imagine how much bagge other people would have. it‚Äôs not kind to think this is an easy path it‚Äôs definitely not wise to feel like you‚Äôre better than others just because you think you know¬† you can‚Äôt know nothing. you can only become it. thinking others should also believe you is ludicrous. they have to discover it themselves everything else is just nonsense¬†\n\nalso i don‚Äôt like your post language. too much words and ego. me me me me me that‚Äôs all i hear. you‚Äôre not even close to nothing yet. ¬†nothing is nothing. there are no answers or solutions to nothing. nobody can tell you anything because it would be completely wrong for you.¬†"

I'm glad you are on the mend! It's good that you are being so observant\n\nlol that‚Äôs exactly it! It‚Äôs just such a mindfuck and completely strange. I hope to make the most of this and just seeing what some people would recommend for someone in my situation. I definitely feel like it‚Äôs a second chance at life and a chance to reprogram my mind potentially.

Hopefully I can make it a positive.\n\nIsn‚Äôt it a positive to have a quiet mind?\n\nYes, that‚Äôs exactly what I‚Äôm focusing on. I‚Äôm trying to enhance what I see as a silver lining from having a stroke‚Äîhaving a quieter mind. I‚Äôm looking for ways to make the most of this newfound mental calm.\n\nAs someone with unmedicated adhd whose brain runs a mile a minute, I am envious. I have to do mushrooms regularly to shut my brain/ego up so I can be at peace with myself, only thing keeping me sane these days.\n\nUnmedicated but you do shrooms...to medicate. Why don't you just hop on traditional medication?\n\nI despise amphetamines, they make me feel horrible. I don't want to be drugged up 24/7 like a zombie, which is how I felt on adderall. I just need a break from the racing thoughts every now and then and shrooms work quite well.\n\nI don‚Äôt want to take adderall, but I have to in order to function. When I do shrooms my adhd and anxiety definitely calm down. I‚Äôd like to try microdosing, how do you take yours? Eat it? Mushroom coffee? Tea?\n\nI typically just eat them straight but the taste can be unpleasant for some. Sometimes I grind them and make teas, just depends. I microdose by buying premade 150mg capsules from my plug. Take 4-5 days on 2-3 days off for best effects, helps mitigate tolerance buildup. The increased neuroplasticity from shroom microdosing anecdotally seems to help with both adhd and anxiety. Shame there arent many studies on it since they made them illegal.\n\nDid you try cbg?\n\nYou took too high a dose/ incorrect medication if it gives you a zombie feeling. If you're quiet around others, then that's a great sign the dosage is too high.\n\nYeah i have tgought about trying again with a different med/dosage, if my insurance will cover it.\n\n where are you getting the shrooms from ?and How?

Be still and know that I am God. You don‚Äôt know how to implement it, just talk around it. Talking is different from the experience.\n\nThis is golden opportunity to use The Law Of Assumption effortlessly, perfect post to help you get instantly how to enjoy life at your terms https://www.reddit.com/r/NevilleGoddard/s/cyrgw0F40h\n\nYou could try Leigh brasingtons methods to enter Jhana states.¬†\n\n\nhttps://www.leighb.com/jhana3.htm\n\nImma try this, thank you kindly.\n\nPlease report back!\n\nOh dude, *really* good call. Wow.\n\nWow! I can recognize so much in that text in my own experience. I had not thought about the deep breath I take as a bad thing, nor about me smiling with gratitude being helpful.\n\nI've always been fascinated by the jhanas since learning about them, but I know my likeliness to have this experience is inversely proportional to my desire to generate it. \n\nOn the other hand, the things I would need to do to create the necessary conditions are things I want to work on anyway for their own sake (be more relaxed &amp; happy &amp; ethically upright, get better at concentration in general, etc) so I figure there's no harm in it. And maybe one day when I'm not trying very hard it'll just happen.\n\nWhat are your emotional reactions like? Do you get angry still and if so is there a mind interpretation between the external source of the anger and the creation of anger as a feeling?\n\nI still experience anger, and when it happens, I tend to shut down in the moment. I‚Äôm naturally more reactive, and I often avoid explaining myself because I struggle with aphasia. The frustration of trying to find the right words, especially when I‚Äôm angry, makes it harder to express my feelings, so I choose not to engage in those situations. I self reflect a lot now because of this\n\nDoes the self reflection not play out as an inner dialogue be that words, images, replaying events or whatever?\n\nInner dialogue as words but again it‚Äôs intentional. If it‚Äôs not intentional my mind is usually just blank. I use to have non stop chatter so it‚Äôs a big change for me.\n\nSomething is driving the anger when it happens though it can't be just the external event because without thought the event is just something you witness it is the mind's interpretation of the event that causes the emotional response. So your situation is really interesting, on the whole it is really positive. Do you feel happier than before the stroke and are you more able to directly experience the world - are trees more wonderful, colour more transfixing etc\n\nI feel positive overall, but I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs necessarily more than before the stroke. I‚Äôve always maintained a positive outlook on life. As for experiencing the world more directly, I haven‚Äôt spent much time outdoors lately. However, I‚Äôve always been deeply moved by natural beauty, like when I‚Äôve visited places such as the Grand Canyon or Sedona‚Äîthose moments naturally leave me feeling awestruck.\n\nThe inner chatter people have is the ego, mostly creating a false identity by taking positions on what it likes and doesn't like, what it considers is good or bad, creating attachments to those positions, getting into fights about them, reacting to things and so on. Meditation stills the chatter for a time so the innate self can rise up and directly experience the world without the ego drowning it out. I completely trust your chatter is gone but at the same time I don't think you are in a state of atman or spacious awareness from what you have said but it is possible such a state is very close for you now. I don't have any meditations to suggest but I would suggest challenging any conditioned beliefs that might be lingering. To that end I would read A New Earth by Eckhart Tolle if you haven't already that should act as a springboard into a wider realisation of the nature of reality. Hope this helps.\n\nThat‚Äôs deep. Much more than first thought\n\nThe absence of inner chatter does not necessarily mean that you reached deeper states of meditation. The criterion is not so much the amount (or absence) of inner chatter but whether you get to a point where you yourself consciously recognize the non-dual, non-conceptual awareness at the root of every single mental event. That's, e.g. in the theravada vipassan tradition, called \"stream entry\".\n\nBut, in some sense, having less inner chatter is helpful to observe the mind more clearly. That's why many traditions first teach you to start with concentration meditation, i.e. you learn to control the mind to such a minimum degree that the remainder of the meditation becomes much easier because you are much less distracted.\n\nHere are some instructions you can try out for yourself. (Warning: these instructions are specifically for OP, they are not necessarily suited for others.)\n\nFirst, get into a somewhat concentrated and relaxed state of mind.\n\nThen, make sure you open up your mind to not block out any sensory events. Make your mind wide, so to say.\n\nDirect the attentive mind towards the inner stream of thoughts (or the lack thereof).\n\nNow, when a thought arises, observe very closely WHERE FROM it arises. Can you pinpoint that place? Or does it arise from nowhere? From the totality of space? Or from any place in your body? Does the thought itself have any color? Does it have a shape or a form? How can you distinguish it from any other thoughts? Are there any gaps between thoughts, or is it one single thought morphing into the next? Does the thought have a sound? Can you even distinguish that at all?\n\n(Hint: If you don't get any thoughts, loosen up a bit. If that does not yet help, then willfully produce a simple thought, it does not matter too much, what thought that is.) Observe your thoughts in that way, try to really figure out where they come from.\n\nAfter a while, proceed to the next step. This time observe where the thoughts GO TO when they disappear. Can you pinpoint that place? Is it anywhere at all? Can you even say where it is? Is it \"everywhere\" or rather \"nowhere\" or anything else? Do they lose their form when they disappear? Or their color? Or their shape?\n\nWhen you've done that for a while, then proceed to the next phase. This time, when there is a thought currently ongoing, try to observe WHERE it stays. Is there a place? If yes, how is this place any different from the thought itself? Can they two even be distinguished? Does that place have a form? Is it a thought itself?\n\nThe goal here is not to do intellectual reasoning about your thoughts, but to truly come to a non-conceptual insight about their nature.\n\nBeyond that point, there would be different instructions then.\n\nThanks for outlining this. \n\n-Is this practice supposed to bring back the internal monologue?\n\n-When willfully producing thoughts, should that be repeated regularly?\n\n-What is then the success state of the practice, are there any sort of identifiers of it or pointers?\n\n&gt; Is this practice supposed to bring back the internal monologue?\n\nNo.\n\n&gt; When willfully producing thoughts, should that be repeated regularly?\n\nThe point is simply to have material to work with. If you have no thoughts, that's not useful for this practice. Whether you repeat a thought or don't repeat it does not matter, what matters is that you have some thoughts you can work with.\n\n&gt; What is then the success state of the practice, are there any sort of identifiers of it or pointers?\n\nObtaining certainty about the distinction between underlying awareness and content of mind.\n\nHowever, I have to repeat: These instructions are for OP specifically, not for other meditators out there. There are prerequisites for these instructions to work, and if not met, the effect will be nil.\n\nWhenever I try to meditate all my thoughts are about thoughts and it becomes a paradox of never ending thoughts about thoughts about thoughts\n\nWell, these instructions are not for you then. Your task should be to first develop a level of control over the stream of thoughts through concentration, not to think about thoughts.\n\nExpert meditators HATE this one trick!\n\nLike not ‚Äútalking‚Äù to yourself?  Or trying but not getting a response?\n\nSo the default mode network (DMN) is not functioning post-stroke? Like this could have advantages in a strange sort of way, but I have not got this so it is hard for me to understand.  The DMN does not speculate as to future possibilities such as hopes and fear (projected possibilities of possible gains or losses, respectively)? Some could say that this is the aim of some ideas on meditation. Can you form goals?\n\nLike 'positives'...what would be the outcome you are looking for here?  If the DMN has been damaged, then you would need to formulate ways of thinking as to how you cater for this loss with different forms of thinking and meditation could be a part of that but you would need to pinpoint what is missing and work on that to stimulate other parts of the brain to learn that ability.  The DMN is spread over different parts of the brain so total loss of it's function is doubtful and it does define ego to a large extent.  The brain is plastic and could learn that, but what are you missing that you want back?  You could just accept this radical change and get on with your life regardless?  People frequently hate the constant chatter of the DMN.\n\nI work with stroke survivors and the prospect of the DMN being affected has always been a possibility in my mind which I have not come across and wondered how it would actually affect a person in terms of wellbeing, assuming it is the DMN that has been damaged as other systems could be affected.\n\nI‚Äôm still able to set goals, but I have to keep them in front of me because I tend to forget things easily. To manage this, I try to keep my priorities at the forefront of my mind. I also experience a lot of fear about the future, especially because I‚Äôm a father to a young daughter. I‚Äôm hopeful that meditation can help me stay focused and use that time for intentional thinking, since during the day, my mind doesn‚Äôt wander or generate thoughts unless I purposefully engage it. This often leads me to go through the motions without much direction.\n\nOne of the things I‚Äôve lost is my ability to think quickly on my feet. Before the stroke, I could mentally prepare and direct conversations, but now I tend to speak without much forethought, which feels strange and disorienting. I‚Äôm not always sure if I‚Äôm explaining myself well anymore. I‚Äôve recently started playing chess and am now turning to meditation to help me stay grounded. My focus on self-improvement is mainly driven by my desire to avoid future strokes, especially because I want to be there for my daughter.\n\nSo there is a loss of short term memory? If you fear about the future, is this a chatter in your brain of possible future outcomes that are negative and detrimental to yourself and your family? Are these repetitive thoughts? So it is about a loss of focus too?\n\nSo you want a kind of reminder of what is going on in your life as you tend to move away from this and it is hard to evaluation the importance of your present situation and those who are important to you? The same mechanism could be a fault that monitors what you are saying and your staying focused?  It could be that your ‚Äòinternal monitor‚Äô is not functioning?  Could it be ‚Äòmeta-cognition‚Äô where your awareness of your own thinking and actions is functioning less than it should be?  Like your internal thought monitor is at fault?  Meditation would make a lot of sense if that is the case as you could built this muscle up or learn it elsewhere in your brain. \n\nAll because you have had a stroke does not mean you will have future ones.  It is about good diet, exercise and not smoking and drinking.  Also good control of blood pressure and cholesterol.  This is all you can do. Only worry about what you can control and leave the rest to fate.\n\n I could also see if your internal monitor is not functioning then the thoughts about your daughter would not be reduced and this could lead to a great deal of distress.  Meditation and maybe a bit of cognitive behavioural therapy could help.\n\nI‚Äôve noticed that my short-term memory has been affected, but not to the point where it impacts my ability to do my job. My fears and repetitive thoughts mostly occur during downtime‚Äîif I‚Äôm busy or actively doing something, my mind stays quiet. Conversations are more challenging now, not because I lose track, but because it‚Äôs harder to find the right words to express what I‚Äôm thinking. I often feel like I need more time to formulate my response, and it can be frustrating when conversations move too quickly for me to gather my thoughts.\n\nI‚Äôve become much more vigilant about my health, focusing on diet, sleep, and staying hydrated. I‚Äôve even started using a CPAP machine to improve my sleep quality.\n\nDoing tasks does inhibit internal chatter in us all.  Meditation may make these fears and repeditive thoughts become more evident as it is 'downtime'..so you can observe them and see them as just thoughts and let them pass.  Sounds like word recall and gathering your thoughts is where you are affected, but that should repair with time depending on the amount of loss.  Other parts of the brain should compensate over time. Meditation should help.\n\nWell done at becoming more vigilant about your health.  Staying healthy is hard work. so don't bully yourself about it if you are not perfect at it cos none of us are. None of us are perfect at meditation either and practice should help over time.\n\nGood luck on your healing journey, sounds like a challenge but it sounds like you have the answers already.\n\nMaybe I've had a stroke and didn't notice, this describes me to a T for the last few years.\n\nSame thing happened to me when I got poisoned, I was about 17-18 at the time, I'm 30 now and my chatter has come back somewhat but probably not back to how it was. \n\nYour mind may heal, it just takes time and you know whats weird? I realised that the lack of chatter is also a thought in a way, when I lost my lack of chatter it felt like I lost a thought or feeling that I was so used to. \n\nWe all change, that's a part of life, constantly changing and shifting.\n\nDid you do anything to bring back the chatter?\n\n&gt;when I lost my lack of chatter it felt like I lost a thought or feeling that I was so used to. \n\nAny more you can say about this? Any ideas on the sort of the thought or feeling it was?\n\nIt just came back gradually I guess, I do take lions mane supplements on and off, have been doing that for about a few years now at least. \n\nIt started off as a complete inability to think, it was a feeling of complete mental fog, the inability to see or have control over my third eye, when I tried to think my thoughts dissolved into TV static.\n\nIt was a very scary change because it happened overnight, literally. I thought I was going to get dementia or turn into a vegetable or something. \n\nBut I just adapted to it really after the initial freakout, I let the 'thoughts' come to me, I could still talk and do things, people didn't notice much difference other than the fact that my speech seems forced.\n \nI had to become a 'human doing' by necessity, doing things without thinking became a lifestyle or thought in itself. It's getting easier slowly but surely and it is nice to be getting my chatter back, although I don't think it'll ever come back 100% but I'll be fine either way.\n\nThanks for explaining, that sounds rough:/\n\nIt's been interesting so far! \n\nThis video has been helpful lately https://youtu.be/xg3O_G9Gr_8?si=H1_ML8iXmKdZIRIR\n\nWas the stroke recent? I had this a little after mine, it was like my brain had emptied or something, but it came back over time for me.\n\n\nYou could just start out with a basic beginners meditation course via an app and see how it goes. I did it as part of my own healing process, as I'd tire /get overstimulated easily. Still helps.\n\nLast year Jan Friday the 13th. I plan to, Im just seeing if there‚Äôs any recommendations I feel that would be helpful for me. So far everyone has given really great suggestions and plan to implement them at night when I can have time to myself.\n\nIf you don't mind me asking, do you still have the ability to visualize imagery or other sensory content?\n\nDepends on your goal.  If you're new and don't have a lay of the land, start with guided meditations and work on calm and focus.  I've known dissociating people who have lost their inner monologue but it can reemerge.  Seems it's probably still going on, just not available to your conscious mind.\n\nIf the mind relaxes then it slows and stills. If you learn how to do that in meditation practice (the late Dr Ainslie Meares method) then you can learn how to cultivate that state in daily living. In daily living people, think and do and so the mind cannot be still but it can be calm and do things more easily. Does this sound like it applies to you? \n\nIn any event effortless global relaxation is easier to learn than some other methods as it involves relaxation rather than effort, trying and so on.\n\nWoah, that‚Äôs crazy! I‚Äôve never heard of that happening before, I guess there‚Äôs always a silver lining, right? I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre alright after your stroke! I don‚Äôt have any advice, but I wanted to say good luck!\n\nOne of the benefits of being a traumatic brain injury (TBI) survivor is that I experience the glory of silence (sans internal chatter). Pre-TBI, no longer exists, and now I relish in the joy of quiet. Silent meditation is an ocean of quiet I am able to swim in often. The glass is not half empty. The glass is not half full. The glass is overflowing with the joy of each moment.\n\nHow do you feel about that? I think I‚Äôm jealous\n\nLucky you.\n\nA relevant Ted talk where a woman gets stroke and experiences deep meditative state [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYD7Y9CXeUw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYD7Y9CXeUw)\n\nNot having constant internal chatter? This is a great state to be in, you are a fortunate man, to be able to bring in thoughts when you want it or need to, sought by meditators and you already have it; than why would you want to meditate? If it's a blank there must be someone aware of that blank so awareness-consciousness still goes on and you are, THAT. When in that blank you may want to dive deeper, contemplate into that state through awareness which is none other than meditation in itself and it is your true nature for nothing is closer or more intimate then that, for you are THAT. No external gymnastics are required.\n\nBy diving deeper you may find that it is not a blank after all, since you are trying to make this positive for yourself.  You see, all efforts are only directed to lifting the veil of ignorance of who we really are. It appears difficult to quell the thoughts but In the regenerate state it will be found more difficult to call in thoughts and you already have that. In that blank, in that silence there is everlasting speech that is not a response of memory but Supreme Intelligence and that is something you want to listen to and not being interrupted by thoughts. This is that extraordinary jewel of Cosmic Consciousness, which the mind cannot touch, whereas it happens in its absence, yet you are still aware. Therefore, you are not the mind, you are that consciousness\n\nYou may seek opinions of others but keep in mind that they'll be just mere opinions and not facts, unless of course you will seek  those who had this experience of Cosmic Consciousness. I'm speaking from my own experience due to massive stroke (hemorrhage) on the right side of the brain, which paralysed left side, cripple but thankfully still walking. After few weeks being in wheelchair when I recollect myself, out of this blank all there was  a big laughter and the entire wing of the hospital was laughing both, nurses and patients wondering on what medication I'm on that I'm so happy.  \n\n\nIf, this comment caught your attention and you see some value in it give me a hauler and we can discuss it further. I would also highly recommend the book, Cosmic Consciousness by Richard Maurice Bucke and a film Touching The Void, it's on you tube which may clarify things further for you.\n\nYour Default Mode Network has been altered... Check out Michael Pollans book, How to Change Your Mind\n\nBasic single pointed breathing is usually a good place to start.\n\nThat small part of your brain that controls inner chatter probably is still repairing or damaged due to the stroke. If it‚Äôs gone I‚Äôm sorry but don‚Äôt lose hope bc your body is changing cell by cell everyday. Live a healthy life and journal any mental changes as a result of the changes\n\nMeditate on love. Love everyone. Send love to others.\n\nSounds like a dream.\n\nI really think you should find what works for you and maybe take suggestions from people with a similar experience as you. I don't think anyone can truly know how it's like to have no internal chatter unless they don't have it themselves. We can meditate and quiet that chatter temporarily but I don't believe it can be compared 1:1 to your condition.\n\nThis is an interesting post, I guess you really don‚Äôt know the value of water until the well is dry.\n\nPlagued with a thinking mind, one would assume that it‚Äôs a curse but it really sounds like a blessing, coming from you.\n\nWith nothing to distract you from it, you may find mantra chanting to be exceptionally powerful. \nIf you're looking for a more broad resource on the subject of meditation (benefits, methods, use-cases, etc.) I would highly recommend HealthyGamerGG on YouTube (not sure if you'll resonate with the videogames lens but you really don't have to be a gamer to understand Dr. K)\n\nNot all people have an inner monologue to begin with. Some have none from birth, and others have much less than many people describe. It must be really weird to experience a change from lots to none! But the variation itself seems common.\n[](https://www.iflscience.com/people-with-no-internal-monologue-explain-what-its-like-in-their-head-57739)\n\nNever heard of this but it's really fascinating. Guessing this makes you very good at listening?\n\nJust to share that i experience this after an intense acid trip, its almost our personality is no more than just neurons travelling in a certain path\n\nthe grass is always greener on the other side\n\nCan you clarify what negatives you‚Äôre experiencing exactly? Most people aim to reduce constant internal chatter.\n\nAs someone with adhd and anxiety, I can say you‚Äôre very blessed to have a quiet mind. When I meditate and quiet my mind (the only time it‚Äôs quiet), great things come to me: ideas, wisdom, insight, etc. Trust the quiet and receive the gifts of it.\n\nI'm really sorry to hear about the stroke. Wishing you a speedy recovery. \n\nWhich side of your body was it? Knowing this could help a lot of us.\n\nPerhaps try awareness of breathing or awareness of the body and its sensation‚Ä¶ awareness of the thoughts as you choose to think them as you say- maybe even ‚Äòopen awareness‚Äô \n\nüôèüèª\n\nthis is how i operate all the time lol. and i don't have the ability to visualize either\n\nWow that's interesting. Wild speculation: If you already started practicing Satipatthana before the stroke, your brain might have made the decision to not rebuild this part, because you wanted to get rid of it anyway. Like you know, intentional \"use it or lose it\".\n\nWow! This is what people who meditate aim to achieve!\n\n\nThis is a great insight. But I don't think I have had a stroke. But about ten years ago, I went to bed and when a woke up everything felt different.  The chatter as you call it was silent.  It didn't bother at first, then I stressed about it because I felt broken.  Where was my inner voice?  I'm currently on two anti depression meds and have been trying to reach back into myself through meditation and astroprojection.  But mow I have developed a REM sleep disorder where I thrash out in bed sometimes violently.   What a mess.\n\nI‚Äôve had the opposite happen. I remember when I was younger, I was able to just stare into the world. I could just watch stuff happen without having any actual thought. It always felt very tranquil\n\nNow, in the past few years, I‚Äôve gotten into a depression and have been working through a lot of trauma (that I didn‚Äôt really know I had) and now there is not a moment when my brain just shuts off. Even to the point that I it now looks like I have ADD / ADHD\n\nIt would be so nice to get some peace of mind back but I‚Äôm afraid it‚Äôs gone\n\nSounds like a huge positive to me! Meditate and enjoy the lack of thoughts. You can observe the world objectively and without automatic judgement like most of us are forced to. This is a win!!\n\nYeah, I‚Äôm planning on doing a 30 day meditation with some of the suggestions provided. If I like the results it‚Äôll hopefully become part of my daily habits\n\n[deleted]\n\nWell, there‚Äôs good and bad, reads some previous comments for my experience.\n\nSounds similar to the experience of [Jill Bolte Taylor](https://youtu.be/UyyjU8fzEYU). She references the lack of inner voice from about 8:30.\n\nI saw this but she had a cooler experience with it. Im hope to potentially get to that point.\n\ntry the gateway experience, maybe you can do total focus more easily\n\nI‚Äôll try it any YouTube videos or something that shows me more details?\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdbVKRTTUaU&amp;list=PLyEQjwZ4CcejCywjrEf\\_Q4zJp8i8plDfB](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdbVKRTTUaU&amp;list=PLyEQjwZ4CcejCywjrEf_Q4zJp8i8plDfB) as far as know, the legit one,\n\nAppreciate you, I‚Äôll try this tonight.\n\nWould be a huge relief for me.\n\nI really enjoy Metta meditation. Really has improved my peace of mind.\n\nI think it killed part of ur ego! U got something good going on! Remember baba ram if u feel uncertain!\n\nI experience this aswell but I haven‚Äôt had a stroke, idk if it‚Äôs my medication or what, I‚Äôm just too lazy to think\n\nMeditation is necessary only if a person has a negative inner dialogue, it transforms the state from negative to neutral. If this dialogue does not exist and the state is *already neutral*, meditation is not necessary (and even counterproductive).\n\nYou can move higher on the emotional scale‚Äîmoving from neutral to a positive state. This is achieved by techniques such as ‚Äòpositive aspects diary‚Äô, ‚Äògratitude diary‚Äô, ‚Äòscripting‚Äô, etc. A full list of techniques can be found in the book ‚ÄòAsk and it is given‚Äô, it has 22 processes at the end that correspond to different states.\n\nThat‚Äôs an interesting perspective. It‚Äôs true that meditation is often used to address negative thoughts and emotions. However, it‚Äôs not just about neutralizing negative chatter. Meditation can also help deepen your self-awareness, cultivate mindfulness, and enhance overall well-being.\nEven if you‚Äôre already in a neutral state, meditation can be a valuable tool. It can help you maintain that state and explore deeper levels of awareness. I agreed to moving on on the higher emotional scale! But I disagree on the part where you say it‚Äôs only necessary if you‚Äôre not in a neutral state and question the counterproductive aspect of it.\n\nExactly this. Imagine having a positive inner monologue that‚Äôs constantly commenting on how positive everything is‚Ä¶ it would still keep you at an arms length from the reality that is, or from just being.\n\n&gt;*Imagine having a positive inner monologue*\n\nThat's not how it works\n\n&gt;*Meditation can also help deepen your self-awareness, cultivate mindfulness, and enhance overall well-being*\n\nYes. If you are in a negative state, meditation will have that effect. And if you are in a positive state, meditation will not have that effect. But other techniques will.\n\n&gt;*question the counterproductive aspect*¬†\n\nOkay. It's a very simple thing to test. Wait for a morning when you wake up and your soul is singing, sit down to meditate and see what happens. My result was that the state rolled back (to neutral).\n\nI disagree. This is not at all how it is. Meditation can have that effect no matter how you feel. Even while your soul is singing. And *can* be beneficial for others.\n\nYou mean for *you* it doesn‚Äôt have this affect! Because it can have this affect for me! And it does for many others, *especially* monks.. which is what they‚Äôre all about :)\n\nMeditation does always bring out what is within you and peel you like layers to an onion. If it doesn‚Äôt for you, I‚Äôm assuming there‚Äôs a possibility that there can still be things within you that need to come out! Or, maybe it‚Äôs as simple as to each their own.\n\nEither way I‚Äôm glad that you found a method that works for you to raise your vibration!\n\n&gt;*You mean for¬†you*\n\nYes. For me and those whose judgment I trust in their adequacy and sincerity.\n\n&gt;*I disagree*\n\nüëå\n\nI read my gratitude journal every morning helps a lot.\n\nI assume you have a stroke on the left hemisphere of your brain?"

That‚Äôs when I discovered Insight Timer and haven‚Äôt looked back since.\n\nI started with Insight Timer when I started meditating three years ago, and never even tried anything else because i had all i needed here!\n\nYea it‚Äôs a bloody beautiful app! Love the community feel to it as well!\n\nI just don't know what to do with the friendships option. I'm already doing socials on the socials. Is there some benefit to it that I'm missing?\n\nI don‚Äôt think the majority of account holders use it for social connections. Just my opinion.\n\nSame here! Love being able to create my own meditation programs with as many bell sounds as needed to shift focus/intention. Love the reverberating GONG sound to denote ‚Äúit‚Äôs a wrap!‚Äù ‚ò∫Ô∏è\nAlso the session logs are cool and now we can  add a session if need be. \nCustomer service has always been swift to respond to my inquiries. I‚Äôve used this app daily for 5 years.\n\nLove to hear this! I‚Äôm at three years and I‚Äôll never stop.\n\nThat‚Äôs awesome!\nIt‚Äôs so nice to have a meditation app that‚Äôs maturing alongside me, and capable of supporting my needs as I grow into a veteran meditator.  üßòüèΩ\n\nI also started with Calm, but after reading some books on meditation, it's obvious that all apps are mostly gimmicks and you just need a timer.\n\nI worry that Insight Timer is also going more corporate. Lots of \"Plus Member\" content creeping all over the app. Still a great user experience overall though.\n\nI've tried many apps and keep coming back to insight timer. While most of the new content is behind a pay wall, they have a huuuuuge back catalogs of free meditations and mindfulness practices. You can make your own playlists of things which is probably the feature that keeps me coming back. I've got one for panic attacks, migrains, sleep etc. They're also have a decent live selection too.\n\nYes!!!!! And it‚Äôs free.  There is a premium version offered, but I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs really any better to be honest.  I love the ability to search for what I‚Äôm looking for. And of course i have an extensive saved list. Also i follow certain teachers. There‚Äôs great breathwork too!\n\nI paid for the premium version this year because I wanted to do a particular course, but found myself mostly using the free content besides the course. But I was still happy to support the app as it's just so good.\n\nYes! Same! I ended up buying premium and noticed I probably didn‚Äôt need it, but feel so passionate and thankful for the changes it‚Äôs brought about in my life and mental state that I wanted to support it!\n\nDon't you just love it when a company works that way instead of pulling you in with marketing tricks? I think it's great!\n\n__Yes ! ‚Äî Insight Timer!__ I‚Äôve been using it for more than five years. I‚Äôve tried other apps, including Calm, but it‚Äôs not worth the cost... Nothing else compares. There are many options on the free __Insight Timer__ app, and there are also thousands of guided meditations and courses by dozens of well-known, reputable meditation teachers.\n\nI‚Äôve gotten a lot of value out of some of the paid courses. Especially the one on ‚Äúletting go‚Äú. \n\nA few years ago everything was free, then certain features were added and membership options became available. I signed up immediately for some of the options at a lifetime discount price.\n\nI have exclusively used Insight Timer since I started meditating in 2014 and have since logged 13.9K minutes in meditation üòä\n\nI used insight timer for a while and even found some good ones to do with my young kids. My challenge with the app is that there is such a huge volume of Content that unless I‚Äôm going to spend a few hours just searching for content that I think I would listen to, It‚Äôs hard to find teachers and classes that I like. Similar challenge with waking up but I find their categories are more accurate and separated better¬†\n\nI like to use the search and then I check out the rating. :) I also like how it gives me recs on my home page based on what I‚Äôve done so far. Most of the time, I choose from those recs now.\n\nAlso my favorite! Although I am not a fan of the newest layout / update- The things things I DO love:\n1. So much diversity of content even under the free version * I pay for premium bc I like it so much \n2. Long form sound tracks - I love the 8hour sleep sounds \n3. Daily quotes \n4. Check in/ takes the place of me journaling\n5. Sound therapy + sound healing\n6. Easy to set timers for yourself if you just want a background sound or silence for the amount of time you set and can do a time check in noise for yourself. I personally love coming into and out of a meditation with the sound of a singing bowl much more than a regular phone timer \n7. Breath work teachers\n8. Wonderful challenges and classes I have learned a lot\n\nInsight Timer used to be great but then they demonstrated that they'd fix what wasn't broken, like you used to be able to leave interval timers running after the meditation ended if you wanted to keep going, but after an update the interval timers stopped after the timer ended.\n\nI read that as Insight Time.  As in ‚ÄúPizza Time!‚Äù  It is, in fact, Insight Time!\n\nCame here to say this! So awesome, especially once you've bookmarked all your favorites.\n\nCame here to say this. Best all around\n\nOne more for Insight Timer. The free version has so many options, so it's really not a funnel thing, even though I might upgrade once I can afford it. It's great.\n\nwaking up has been nice\n\nI‚Äôve also enjoyed waking up. It was everything I personally was looking for in an app so I bought the yearly.\n\nAnyone can try it free 30 days\n\nAnd they have scholarships for if you can't afford it!\n\nWaking Up\n\nI love Waking Up. It‚Äôs made a profound difference in my life.\n\nWaking Up.\n\nMedito\n\nPlum village has tons of good ones.\n\nSecond this. Plum village by far my favorite. Educational and nice to know exactly what I‚Äôm learning. Rather than being on Insight timer and running into weird new age shit lol.\n\nAnother vote for Waking Up! Tried so many and just stuck with this one. It has a nice amount of content with regular updates. So many different guided meditation tracks with different lengths and focus, as well as simply the daily one. There's also other sections called Theory and Life with other tracks of things to listen to and learn about. It's all very user friendly too. I don't find it as overwhelming as others like Insight Timer where you'd spend all day trying to decide lol. And then others are too basic. It has a nice balance. The option to pay what you want is great, especially for what you get for whatever you pay.\n\nHere's a link for 30 days free trial, you don't need to subscribe or add card details for it (and I don't receive anything for sharing it either):\n30-day guest pass\nhttps://dynamic.wakingup.com/guestpass/SCE17FC3B\n\nwhat do you do after the 30 days free trial? Do you have to pay for it?\n\nYeah you do, you can either subscribe via the app which will be the full normal rate, [here](https://www.wakingup.com/checkout) via the website, or if you want to use their scholarship program go [here](https://app.wakingup.com/scholarship) for the details\n\nWaking up\n\nWaking up\n\nI‚Äôve been using Balance for a few months. Really enjoying it. And you get it free for a year.\n\nThis is mine too!\n\nOfuso's voice and delivery are the gold standard of meditation in my opinion. This app is my \"special treat\" meditation app.\nHappily paid for a lifetime sub\n\nI started with waking up a couple years back, it's still a great app\n\nI love the Waking Up App.   it is a subscription but you can email for a discounted membership or a full scholarship for the first year.   Once you email them, you decide what you are comfortable with paying or  not paying.  \n\nIts a very useful and and is filled with a lot of great content/meditations.\n\n+1 for Waking up. If the price is too high, you can contact their support and pay what you can.\n\nInsight Timer, Tide, Plum Village, Meditopia, Medito, Superhuman, Waking Up, and Oak are good just to name a few. My personal favorite is Insight Timer\n\n[removed]\n\nI like the idea, will try it out. Thanks for sharing!\n\nTry Insight Timer and Oak. Also Tara Brach has a podcast where she does guided meditations.\n\nTara Brach is great. Her website has free classes too!\n\nYes she is amazing! I read Radical Acceptance early in my meditation practice and listen to the podcast on a regular basis.\n\nI‚Äôve been using headspace and it‚Äôs really nice\n\nBeen using headspace since 2017 and it just gets better for me overtime\n\nHey me too, friend! I started in may 2017. Can‚Äôt think of using anything else\n\nSmiling Mind and Healthy Minds! Both free and great\n\nI use smiling mind and I like it. Funded by the government I think and they employed like the psychologists board of aus or something like that. I haven't tried others tho to be fair.\n\nI like Insight Timer.\n\nBut do I have to pay?\n\nI love Insight Timer. And no, you don‚Äôt have to pay to get lots of really great content.\n\nNope. Free version has all you need.\n\nThe Way has been awesome for my practice\n\nTen percent happier for guided meditations \nInsight timer for solo meditations\n\nlove Ten Percent Happier!\n\nI loved and used Ten Percent for several years, but the $100/year price tag just got to be too expensive. Especially since they stopped adding new material in the past year.\n\nI'm surprised nobody has mentioned that you don't need an app to meditate, just set your phone to \"Do Not Disturb\" and set a timer for the duration you wish to meditate. If you don't know how to meditate the best way to learn is reading a book like Mindfulness in Plain English or The Mind Illuminated.\n\nGoogle Balance is free for an entire year! And it's pretty good so far\n\nIt's not a Google app\n\nMedito. Free and of top quality.\nWaking up. Premium app.\n\nLove both. But prefer Waking up as my daily meditation app.\n\nI use the audible app and listen to spiritual texts while meditating.  Highly reccomend.\n\nPlum village I would say\n\nI use Insight timer. It‚Äôs free and there‚Äôs loads of choice. It‚Äôs really good\n\nDownDog is good for me since there are so many variable options and I love their workout apps too. But I also like Audiojoy because it has nice binaural beat tracks.\n\nI‚Äôve been meditating for years with great success but I‚Äôve never once understood what an app is supposed to be doing. \n\nMake it harder, more of a challenge? Added distraction? Guidance for something that is only limited by guidance? \n\nNo app is still the best choice. Most apps only offer basic functions and guided escapism anyways. They mislead people into believing that escapism can be compared to meditation, which is dangerous if you‚Äôre just getting started.\n\nGabriele martinele provides mediations on his youtube i highly recommend\n\nMedito\n\nAnother vote for Insight Timer! There is a free version, and it has plenty of meditations to choose from :) Guided and unguided.\n\nMedito\n\nI am a big fan of FitMind App. It has really taught me about what meditation is about. Definitely not your normal meditation app. Takes away that myth that meditation is blocking out the noise. Not always. It can‚Äôt hurt to check it out. I tried a few but always dropped them. This one I use daily.\n\nFitMind is my favorite as well, I like the way the meditations are categorized. Helps me find what I am interested in.\n\nExactly. And I love marking my favorites. Though I tend to flick back to those too often üòÜ have to explore more. Love the Just Being meditation. Even the Memento Mori meditation is grounding. Some may think it‚Äôs morbid to meditate about if this was your last breath but I find it very humbling and eye opening.\n\nAura!\n\nI don‚Äôt use apps, I use a faraday case\n\nTen Percent &amp; Healthy Minds\n\nMedito and idanim. Both are free.\n\nI didn‚Äôt know about either of these, thanks! üòä\n\nTurn the phone off. Works wonders.\n\nIn addition to Plum Village and Insight Timer (both free), sometimes I will put on the Deep Focus playlist on Spotify and just set a timer on my watch for the time I intend to meditate.\n\nPlum Village!\n\nBalance is a really good meditation app\n\nBalance &amp; Youtube.\n\nMeditativo is simple but SO GOOD\n\nWaking Up and The Way\n\nMedito\n\nLuminate\n\nInsight Timer and I personally love Sarah Blondin and David Ji\n\nWaking up has the best content imo. Another Reddit user described it as a library for human well-being. I agree.\n\nI forget the cost, but they offer it for free if you can‚Äôt afford to pay.\n\nURL: https://www.wakingup.com/\n\nUsed Waking Up for a few months and i just got frustrated with the duality concepts that were forced into every meditation. i switched to Balance and it was much easier which for me i needed to build a routine.\n\nBalance and Insight Timer. Balance is better for personalized courses I find where as Insight Timer is good for different styles of meditation\n\nCalm app. The gamification like streaks and emojis helped a beginner like me.\n\nDownloading YouTube meditate vuds\n\nPersonally love the Healthy Minds app\n\nTara Brach has a free podcast (accessible through any podcast app) where you can access thousands of  meditations and talks, and she releases new ones too. It's incredible, highly recommend it.\n\nMedito. It's completely free too\n\nThe best app is having no app. No external factors should contribute to the meditation technique. It‚Äôs good at the beginning if it helps to start and with time one should come out from it automatically and you yourself become the ultimate universe, mind quietness by itself and you will realize it automatically\n\nWaking Up\n\nHonest question. I am not trying to gatekeep or seem pretentious. How does an app aid in meditation? Meditation is an exercise in just being and noting everything that entails. Why does one need an app to do that?\n\nSattva for me!\n\nLearning to enter a state of meditation does not require any applications. The problem is to train the brain, not the mind. The brain works like a classic neural network with a fundamental feature that is neuroplasticity. So, in order to teach the brain a state of meditation out of laziness, you have to use brain wave patterns for such a state. This is not one frequency, but a whole package appropriately composed. There are such recordings available on YT, which use binaural beats to teach and reinforce such brain behavior. Such a recording must necessarily include all brain wave ranges: delta, theta, alpha, beta1, beta2, gamma. Here is the name of the channel for something like that OBSERVER Baazyl\\_Baaz. There are many scientific studies conducted by renowned scientific centers that confirm the effectiveness of binaural beats in the treatment of PTSD, ADHD, depression, etc., but not only through one dominant frequency, but their entire package made in appropriate proportions. The brain subjected to these external patterns learns to enter such states of consciousness very quickly. After a few such recordings you are able to do it on your own without any external help, in effect without any application or recording because you already have your own brain patterns for a given state. The dominant frequency for maintaining a state of meditation is in the order theta, delta and gamma, and then the rest: alpha and beta1, beta2. For healing and regeneration and for very deep meditation the dominant frequency delta etc. is required.\n\nI've never seen an app for meditation worth the price and that includes free ones.\n\nApps didn't even exist 20 years ago and  meditation has been around longer than recorded history.\n\nIf we managed just fine for thousands of years like this, why do you think an app helps considering they're mostly just more distraction?\n\nWhy does everything have to be an app? What are the best meditation mp3s? Or YouTube videos. Just download the audio only with NewPipe. Free, no ads you they're yours.\n\nInsight Timer works best for me. It has free meditations and if you choose to pay you can access the premium meditations and courses. Also, lots to choose from with thousands of teachers\n\nInsight Timer! There is a free version\n\nOpen app, insight timer\n\nHeadspace. Been using it since 2016. I like that it has no sounds like nature in the background. Background sounds can be distracting for me\n\nYou can turn those off in most apps, fyi\n\n[deleted]\n\nOh wow, there are so many to choose from. What about the app, Expand?\n\nI use headspace since I still have the $10 a year student discount\n\nMuse. This assumes that you have the headband, which might not fit the ‚Äúaffordable‚Äù requirement.\n\nFitMind\n\nMedito is the best. Not too much talking. And free.\n\nMedativo\n\nBreath ball! It‚Äôs a breath timer\n\nI'm new to this. Declutter the mind has been good to me. Not sure why no one mentioned it.\n\nRather than an app I use Lizzy hill‚Äôs yoga nidra uploads on YouTube\n\nWaking up\n\nMedito! It's completely free, and if you'd like to contribute you can donate to them. \n\nIt's been my most used app since the pandemic, and the best!\n\nEnso app\n\nPLUM VILLAGE! (Shouting it from the rooftops). All content is free, and it's pretty much all I need.\n\nIf you have an iPhone I like the podcast app that comes with the system\n\nThis has been helpful, thank you!\n\nInsight timer\n\nOnly for the timer since nothing is practically free anymore unless you buy premium subscription\n\nWaking up is the way\n\nOpen\n\nCalm app\n\njust curious but what does a meditation app do? personally i keep my phone as far away as possible\n\nInsight timer. It gives you awards for consecutive days of meditation. It‚Äôs probably the main reason I made meditation a daily practice, I‚Äôm not on 640 days and I want my blue star and I don‚Äôt want to lose my streaküòÇ. Fr though it‚Äôs an amazing app with every type of meditation available.\n\nI like FitMind\n\nInsight Timer is ALL you need‚ÄîI‚Äôve used free version for 9 years. Meditation, talks, workshops, music, community groups, and everything from wiccans to christians‚Äîso wonderful.\n\natoms\n\nInsight timer!\n\nFitMind, Expand, Headspace, Smiling mind.\n\nBreath Hub works great for me. There is also tons of other useful exercises and material\n\nBreath Hub\n\nI use insight timer. It plays a gong sound at intervals you set.\n\nIdanim is best app and its ad free\n\nPlum Village App\n\nTen Percent Happier\n\nThe app that really helped me is called Resonant Breathing by John Goodstadt. It‚Äôs a simple straightforward app with timed breathing prompts focused on heart rate variability. Although I like insight timer sometimes it gets overwhelming browsing all the options, with Resonant Breathing I just open the app and start.\n\nWaking Up app\n\nOpen\n\nI use Calm.  Got it on 3 months free, and a year's 1/2 price sub through Gamepass perks (when they were good).  Got charged another year 1/2 price, so not complaining.\n\nI just use YouTube.  I Really enjoy Jake kornfields videos.  \n\nI also go to 30 minute meditations through mindful leader.  They have 20 minute meditations lead by a facilitator with  a 10 minute reflection question and optional sharing at the end.  They meet every hour during the week with a some meetings on the weekends.  It‚Äôs a game changer and really keeps me honest with meditation.\n\nI‚Äôve used Calm for a couple of years now, and although my use has died off a bit, I still find it helpful and enjoyable\n\nMind Spa. It used to be called Synctuition.\n\nI love Insight Timer. I‚Äôve had it for years and despite having paid features on it, there are so many free ones, you never need to pay for anything. It‚Äôs honestly such a great app!\n\nI listened to Deepak Chopra's \"\"21 Days of Abundance\" meditation. Changed my life.\n\nI would use the Insight Timer as an actual timer for my own practice (unguided) and Waking Up for guided. \nIt has some really cool features: philosophy talks, different types and lengths of meditation. And even though it is paid, you can try it for free for 30 days and even make an offer (which will actually be taken into consideration) if you can't afford the full price.\n\nHeadspace when it has a 50% discount for a year. It happens a couple of times a year.\nFor 35 euro/year is very good\n\nHeadspace\n\nI used headspace for many years then moved onto no app\n\nSeveral years later, when I thought I was FAR beyond mediation apps I found WAKING UP. Think I will use it for many more years to come (although I regularly meditate just with a timer)\n\n[Meditation Assistant](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=sh.ftp.rocketninelabs.meditationassistant) (free / paid, Android) \n\nA simple timer with all sorts of sounds for start /stop / intervals (all customizable) that also connects to it's own \"Medinet\" so you can meditate virtually along with other people (no camera or whatever, just a network of live mediators), also lets you save your progress to your profile for streaks etc\n\nThe feature I love the most is that it silences all your notifications other than the in app ones. Even Headspace doesn't do that. \n\nI've been using it for years, the developer is friendly and respectful\n\nI like a simple timer app tbh\n\nExpand by Monroe Institute\n\nLots of good recommendations here I didn't know about. \n\nI personally have been using headspace for 6 or 7 years now. I just works for me. \n\nOnly thing I don't like is the lack of breathwork but it looks like Insight Timer has that's so im happy I found out about that. \n\nIf I want something a little more minimalist, I use QuietMind. You set a timer, a bell interval and jump right in.\n\nNo apps¬†\n\nSoul pod, an apple app only for now.  Meditation journeys for 21 days, group with your own people if you like or algorithms will place you with a pod.\n\nTry Petit Bambou\n\nhttps://www.petitbambou.com/en\n\nI love it\n\nPersonally love Headspace\n\nNONE\n\nThe apps are meant as a way for the creator of the app to benefit.  They might be useful for beginners but once you have developed good habits, they are not necessary.\n\nYou‚Äôre better off finding a master to learn under.\n\n\"Stunning 8K resolution meditation app\"üé∂\n\nPura Rasa! She is the BEST\n\nI turn off all my devices to be honest. Never used an app\n\nBalance. Very easy to use and no frills\n\nI‚Äôll say headspace to learn and establish a practice and then insight timer when you‚Äôre done with the programs. That worked great for me at least.\n\nI use calm. It's just nice. I wish they had a way to auto download the meditation for each day automatically.\nI always remember it on my way to the train just about when I'm going to lose signal\n\nI am not entirely sure about what do you meant by apps for meditation but here's a one which is 100% free and famous too incase you don't know it\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=meditofoundation.medito\n\nIt‚Äôs Waking Up for me. The mix of practices and theory lectures is great, and I also check out the podcasts from time to time. Bonus is they have a lot of the Alan Watts catalogue too!\n\nPlum Village is my go to\n\nThere is free app called Mindfulness. I think it was made for vets with PTSD or something like that \n\nCheck out this app, Mindfulness Coach, free on the App Store and Google Play!\nAndroid: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=gov.va.mobilehealth.ncptsd.mindfulnesscoach\niOS: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mindfulness-coach/id804284729\n\nMedito.\n\nI like healthy minds\n\nPlum Village\n\nBreethe\n\nCalm\n\nAtom ‚öõÔ∏è ‚≠ê"

I can dm u mine if u'd like :D\n\nHey, I think a lot about spirituality as well and would definitely be down to chat. Shoot me a DM if you're interested\n\nWhere u from guys\n\nYeah please lmk if there is a discord üôèüèæ\n\nLmk\n\nsame I'd probably start crying and maybe hugging\n\nAnd not high too üòä.\n\nawww iosdghdiugh thank you üò≠\n\nWow, printing this one! Thank you\n\nHow did you get to all of that? Genuine question like what made you realize that\n\nFrom my experience, my ego has been my biggest teacher. He used to cause me so much suffering, until I realized that all that suffering was guiding me towards his misalignment of the truth of how the universe works. He's my friend now, I love him, and I listen to him when he makes me suffer, which allows me to pinpoint where the pain is coming from, validate him then gently direct him towards a detached and present way of thinking, one full of love, compassion, and empathy towards himself and everyone around me.\n\nI'm still a work in progress, but I'd be lying to myself if I said there will be a time where I wont be.\n\nEdit: Just wanted to add that the more I do this in as many mediums as I can (gaming, making art/music, watching shows, listening to music, reading, socializing), the more I end up noticing patterns in how my ego thinks, and that is what I tend to need in order to have said realizations, because their application becomes so undeniably universal, yet undeniably effective.\n\nIn a world where everyone has ignored the ego you've befriended it.\n\nThis! üôåüèª\n\nbeautiful.\n\nThis is the Secretü™Ñüí´‚ú®Ô∏èüíõ\n\nHow long have you been meditating? Since when did you see results?\n\nI've been meditating for at least 30 minutes a day for the past 7 months with the last month being an hour a day.\n\nI really don't know how to answer the second question, because looking back I feel like the moment I started I saw results because every boring, negative, happy, anxious, depressing moment of me doing the practice itself was a great result as each gave me valuable insights. I don't really expect results from my practice, I just meditate.\n\nI am not finding time to meditate. I have been listening to stotras/ hymns and that has been taking a lot of time. I have to find half an hour to do this . \n\n\n\n&gt;don't really expect results from my practice, I just meditate.\n\nOf course. That's the sole purpose\n\nyou can meditate while doing many things! You always have the time :)\n\nHow do you meditate while doing other things? You have to sit somewhere and let the mind be free right?\n\nYeah you're right, but that's only if you solely want to meditate and since you can't, your next best option is to do it while doing other things. one good place to start is to do it while you do something mundane/repetitive that doesnt fully need attention like washing dishes, organizing, cleaning, even going for walks! I find that my mind wanders during those types of activities, so meditation def is possible!\n\nI can only listen to guided meditations. I don‚Äôt have the discipline or ability to calm my busy mind just in silence. I must make more time for this. I enjoy morning gratitude meditations from YouTube and at night when going to sleep I listen to nighttime ones.\n\ni mean hey props to you for still doing something despite your \\*ego\\* saying that you don't have the discipline nor ability to calm your mind (\\*psst, the fact that ur doing this already means ur building ur discipline so keep going\\*)\n\nWhat helped me get started is ignoring the length of how long i \"should\" meditate for and only focus on the frequency. Before the past 7 months of consistent meditation, my goal was to do 2 minutes a day for a week! The goal was to stay consistent, I even failed a couple of times and stopped doing it for a month or so, but then i kept coming back to it until I was able to do 5 minutes a day for a week and it was one of my first accomplishments when it came down to consistent, disciplined meditation :D\n\nu can try it too, I'm sure u'll get something out of it even if you dont actually fully stick to it!\n\nThanks for this. I‚Äôve saved your reply so I can refer back to it. What a wordsmith you are. Hope you have a lovely day üôè.\n\nhow can you always be learning and yet continue to know nothing? \n\nwhich is it?\n\nmy knowledge is as insignificant as our planet is to the vastness of the cosmos, but regardless of how tiny our planet is to that, my physical body is a speck of dust compared to our planet, and what is a literal speck of dust my physical body? nothing. it's a speck of dust. it's all relative!\n\nnow imagine continuously expanding your knowledge and your inner world with no end in sight like the continuous expansiveness of the universe. Then, coming back to being a speck of dust of a speck of dust. The difference is indescribable. This realization always keeps me excited to learn more and more in any medium, craft, skill! :D\n\nIf my knowledge could speak, it would say this: I am a speck of dust that always expands, but no matter how much I grow, i'll always remain a speck of dust in the grand scheme of things\n\nIts less knowing nothing about specific areas and more about knowing nothing in the bigger scheme of things. And even with the specific areas it's acknowledgment that there will always be more to know.\n\nI learned that I'm a fool and that's ok.\n\nSame\nThat I‚Äôm my biggest problems and only I can fix my life situation\n\nSame here, but an asshole.\n\nYou are fine with being an asshole? That's some advanced level :D\n\nFor me it's more that I'm a never ending work in progress. If I was an onion, it would be that I peel off one layer of asshole only to find a new layer of asshole I'd not yet considered underneath. But I'd never have managed to get to that layer if I hadn't worked through the first layer of being an asshole. Ad infinitum.\n\nDon't be so hard on yourself!\n\nYou're kind but I have (or atm had) strong personality disorder traits and its taken me decades to unlearn everything and manage them. It's a bit like being a addict, I might be 'sober' at the moment but I'll always have the tendencies under stress so have to remain aware.\n\nStorms will pass, hold tight,\nRoots deep in earth, branches bend‚Äî\nDawn breaks, hope in light.\n\nWhat can you do:)\n\nSame here but an utter loser and i am not okay with it. (Yet)\n\nNah, I bet you‚Äôre not as nearly as much of a loser as you think!\n\nNot in the sense that i don't have control over my life, because i do. I just don't want to be the person that I am. Hell I literally get a panicattack when I have to talk about myself.\n\nOnce you truly become ok with it, it will change. I have seen this with so many things, but am still working to accept being a loser.\n\nI‚Äôve learned while meditating how much I resist allowing myself to just be, I feel the tension in my body.\n\nWhen we think we can't bear our own emotions, we are already bearing them. We are always dealing with emotions at every moment in our lives. Is this fear and resistance what keeps blocking them. Is this idea that we shouldn't have them what triggers more fear. It's fear by fear itself. **This is the tyranny of the mind.**\n\nSame!!\n\nThat I don‚Äôt really know anything, and most of my thoughts are simply reacting to stimuli.\n\nWait till you realize ALL your thoughts are a reaction to stimuli. Then you start becoming even more connected to the external world, and then the external isn‚Äôt so external anymore. The lines between internal and external start to blend\n\nNope, only 70% of mine are stimulus responses /s ü§™\n\nI would gently challenge the assumption that all thoughts are reactions to stimuli. For instance, is creative thinking merely a reaction when we create art? What about the clear mind during meditation contemplating existence? Consider dreams, too. And deep philosophical thoughts or critical analysis of assumptions, such as the idea that \"all your thoughts are reactions to stimuli.\" No offense intended, just offering another perspective for consideration.\n\nCauses and conditions. Creative thinking spawns as a result of conditions. Clear mind spawns as a result of conditions. Dreams, philosophical thought all spawn as a result of conditions.¬†\n\nThinking you are in total control of your thoughts separate from the environment is still clinging to a solid essence of self. Once you look beyond self you‚Äôll realize. Keep investigating the phenomena and behaviors of deliberate thought. This is vipassana\n\nI very much like your thinking and I do agree that sense of self is not independent of environment and external stimuli. However, I would like to highlight that the idea of an independent self is a ... pretty valid way of navigating modern life and experiences and relationships. Without using it at least sometimes, I'd say you're going to have a some extra challenges in life. I do recognize the interconnectedness of environment and self, and I would like to think that this recognition is impossible without distinction, and that understanding this concept promotes wisdom and compassion. I would propose the challenge is to hold this awareness in balance with understanding that sense of self is an illusion. In this way, we can live more harmoniously and communicate true understanding without just relying on dogma.\n\nYeah that‚Äôs what I meant is that the self is not something to be identified with but instead to be aware of. Creative thinking doesn‚Äôt arise from a ‚Äúme‚Äù but rather the phenomena just arises. Independent self are just concepts to explain phenomena but it‚Äôs not a concept we need to keep in mind in order to be compassionate or navigate life. Just the simple act of being aware and trusting yourself is enough and the rest will follow.¬†\n\nBuddhism treats mental formations as one of the six sense gates, so creative thoughts, or thoughts that arise during streams of mental activity would be considered products of your senses, only internal vs external senses.\n\nHmmm how exactly do you mean? ü§î\n\nMany of us are drowning inside our minds\n\nTrue\n\nYup, pretty much everyone is trapped in their thinking minds and they don‚Äôt even know it.\n\nI feel social media has a lot to do with this. I never felt this when I was young before social media was invented. It could be the responsibilities of getting older but I know that social media plays a role in my lack of awareness.\n\nDefinitely a factor. Being young and not really have a solid sense of self/thinking is also a factor.\n\nYou‚Äôre right! Social media has so many thoughts and ideas floating around on who should be. I had to fully disconnect from it so that I can get back to the core of who I am. It was one of the best decisions I made during my journey\n\nLearn to float until the storm passes\n\nExactly this.. flow like water\n\nTo do this method. Anytime you think of something anything \n\n1. Acknowledge the thought \n2. Let it go \n\nRepeat repeat repeat with every thoughts. As SOON as you catch yourself drifting off thinking about something , stop , and say let it go and let your mind go back to blank\n\nI like that. I heard a monk say something similar. He said thoughts are like clouds and your head is the sky. It‚Äôs ok for them to be there and to let them float but you don‚Äôt have to pay any attention to them. Just let them be and float away.\n\nI heard the same thought in a different way, like we‚Äôre meditating at a train station, and our thoughts are the trains that come and go, we can get on the train and entertain the thought, or let it pass and get off, back to the station. It‚Äôs an interesting visual technique too. Maybe it helps me visualize a thought leave and keep going down the tracks.. Eventually another train will come, but it‚Äôs up to you to decide to get on, or off.\n\nThis is a very good answer and it could be a very big help thanks for sharing I may try to implement it as much as possible going forwards.\n\nOr let your mind go back to the object of the meditation.  Not sure what blank is\n\nLet go\n\nThat everybody, no matter who in our lives, was just trying their best with what they had at the time. It‚Äôs the best piece of advice that‚Äôs come to me as I‚Äôve had a lot of close loss, as we all do, and learning to forgive and move past underlying resentments. Also, extremely grateful for these communities where we can share these things, I‚Äôm sure it helps others on their journey :) edit for grammar*\n\nFacts\n\nI‚Äôve learned that before any drama better shut the fuck up, breathe and meditate.\n\nThe only way to cope is to *actually* gain enlightenment.\n\nI mean, if you‚Äôre seeking for enlightenment, then you‚Äôll never be enlightened. It is your ego that seeks to gain enlightenment afterall.\n\nRather disidentify from your self and enlightenment will find you.\n\n‚ÄúDo not speak in absolutes‚Äù. This was a message I received from my higher self in my mind while openly speaking to the universe (it‚Äôs a thing I do when I shower)\n\nIt‚Äôs a thing you SOMETIMES do while you shower  üòâ\n\nThat consciousness is the space where everything else appears. That even the shape of my body disappears when meditating. And that that consciousness is everywhere, shared by every person in this world\n\nEasy on the caffene if I want to meditate.\n\nI learned to stop having expectations of meditation ‚Äúgoals‚Äù. Once I let that go, I‚Äôve gotten much more from meditation\n\nI've been guilty of imposing excessive pressure on myself to feel certain states of being. I really feel like we have to just learn to be present to each changing moment and whatever feeling or experience that may bring and not dwell on the past or be anxious about the future\n\nPresent is everything\nPast is gone \nFuture is not yet to come\n\nCompletely 100% in present as much as possible \nThat the way you live the fullest\n\nI am not this. Nor am I this. Or this. Or this. Whatever arises, is not me. I have no base, no ground. And cool breezes feel nice.\n\nThe present. The past doesn‚Äôt exist and the future neither, is all in your head.\n\nI love it\n\nThat behind all the thoughts, busyness, mental chatter, and intrusive stimulation we receive from our physical senses, \nthere is a quiet serene space where infinite joy and unconditional love abide, where home lies. \nAnd that we don‚Äôt have to ‚Äòtry hard‚Äô to ‚Äòget there‚Äô , we simply have to open ourselves up to it , to simply open up to it. \n\nI understand this, because I have experienced it.\n\nThis is it.\n\nI learned that everything is okay. Doesn‚Äôt matter how bad things seem to get, it‚Äôs all okay.\n\nYou cannot ' not ' meditate. Everytime your mind wonders off and you gently pull it back you are building a small mental muscle. \n\nMay not be the most , but surely it was very helpful lesson for me\n\nI actually think when you're starting out (which I am perpetually cos ADHD) this is one of the most important things to know. Although non-thought is the goal, meditation itself is the process of returning to non-thought again and again over time.\n\nThat there's an open stream of thoughts or there can be. And once you attach to a thought or actively think as if entering a tunnel. It kind of closes that open stream. It narrows possibilities in that moment for diverse thoughts to arise.\n\nLike when you are angry. As long as you attach to vindictive thoughts. There is no open stream and so most of what you get is more of that. Only when you let go. Suddenly other perspectives get more weight. Suddenly it strikes you the sun is shining.\n\nI think the scientific concepts for these unrelated to meditation are diffused mode and focused mode.\n\nDali the painter, used to purposefully seek a strong diffused mode to induce creativity for his paintings.\n\nThis diffused mode is like when you are doing simple rote work and you aren't really thinking but you still experience thoughts as if you are. It's a different experience. More open and relaxed way of thinking. \n\nThat's probably why they refer to it as a natural state.\n\nDo not feed your thoughts, \nThey come and go. üåÄüôè‚ú®\n\nLive love life\n\nThat no one besides me will ever hear what I say, only their interpretation of it\n\nI just came to this realization yesterday. Made me feel invisible and that no matter how physically close I am to someone, we are worlds apart.\n\nThat when i start feeling like a failure or other negative feelings, i don't have to believe those thoughts. I can just breathe and quit thinking for a minute. Then when I think again,  I can choose thoughts that are more factual and objective. That allows me to stay calmer and do better in life in general.\n\nReading [A Million Thougts](https://www.amazon.com/Million-Thoughts-Meditation-Himalayan-Mystic/dp/8184959451/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=a+million+thoughts&amp;qid=1619775626&amp;sr=8-1) and applying the teachings from this book into practice.\n\nAcceptance of\n\nIt is...\n\nThey are...\n\nNo need...\n\nyou can be happy doing the most boring things\n\nlike dishes, stocking shelves, \n\njust gotta rubix cube your brain the right way and the neurons shall sing their release!\n\nLove this! üòç\n\nEffortless effort\n\nI‚Äôve learned to appreciate things for exactly what they are for exactly as long they last. I‚Äôve learned to not grasp onto pleasurable and positive experiences. I appreciate them while they‚Äôre here, and I let them go when they end because I trust that I will experience pleasurable experiences again.\n\nJust here to say that this is a really lovely thread.\n\n1) Not enough sleep will make for an awful meditation session. \n2) We give too much power to useless thoughts. \n3) Observing and dismissing thoughts isn‚Äôt a practice that should stop outside of meditation.\n\nThat I am not my body\n\nI still haven‚Äôt figured out how to meditate.\n\nThere are three steps: \n1. Take a comfortable seat - chair / cushion. Straight back like someone is pulling a the top of your head up with a string.  Hands on thigh.  \n2. Pick an object of meditation - try your breath. It‚Äôs always available. Follow the out breath with light attention.  About 25% attention. \n3. When your mind wonders from your breath, label it ‚Äúthinking‚Äù and go back to your breath.\n\nHave you tried alot of different forms and techniques? Like how they have guided meditations, self love meditations, self inquiry and so on.\n\nThat thoughts are not me and that I am not my thoughts.\n\nThat we are not our thoughts.\n\nI don‚Äôt have to instantly and unconsciously react to everything that happens. I have a space now between an event, and MY reaction to it or not. That‚Äôs big.\n\nThat I've got a sadistic policeman inside my head, and that I shouldn't listen to his advice. Yet, here i am, listening to his every word.\n\n...that to worry adds not one jot nor tittle to your life.\n\nKeep meditating.\n\nIt‚Äôs okay to fall asleep.\n\nPeople arent out to hurt you. They generally have neutral intentions\n\nI'm only curious because I play devil's advocate alot and have a question. How would a rapist or pedophile that actively seeks to fulfill their own desires only have neutral intentions? I understand you also said generally so maybe these are the outliers. It's my bad if this is too dark of a topic to be discussed I just think there is value in figuring out these things.\n\nI should have been more specific. I meant 99% of the time, people arent thinking about you at all. Theyre after their own objectives. But their goal wasn‚Äôt to hurt you. So don‚Äôt take things personally because they would do the same if another person was in your place\n\nWatching my thoughts helped me to stop bullying myself. Still a task everyday but I love those moments I become aware.\n\nI learned that whatever it is that someone has said or done to hurt was their attempt at protecting themselves and wasn‚Äôt a deliberate move to hurt me. And that has helped me release so many resentments . Well some I‚Äôm still clinging onto but I‚Äôm sure one day I‚Äôll be able to release them as well.\n\nComparison is the ROOT of all psychological issues. \n\nEither me vs you or me vs old me.\nSTOP COMPARING. \n\nThe only thing I'm sure of every moment is, I AM.\n\nThere is no free will\n\nWe‚Äôre not that important and everyone is basically good\n\nI trust myself to not just go crazy when I let go of my thoughts and allow them to just be. \n\nWhen I allow this, the mind becomes quite silent.\n\nBut it takes trust you see. The letting go is freedom.\n\nWe are the light\n\ndoing nothing is a form of productivity\n\nI've learned that I need to meditate more.\n\nI learned that meditating well takes time and daily practice, and then one day it all clicks\n\nI asked Buddha how I could be happy, he said smile, and then I was happy.\n\nEverything I know is wrong.\n\nThat we are just an I/O function\n\nMeditation is about kindness.\n\nI learned what meditation really is.\n\nPeople, situations nothing external makes you unhappy. What makes you unhappy is the way you think. Your thoughts make you unhappy not external factors. Also, how you react to it.\n\nNone of this is real\n\nI don't have to react to my thoughts or my physical sensations. Thoughts will go away automatically.\n\nThat I accutualy can fill my body and mind with some odd and wonderful kind of energy - that it actually works (don't ask me how).\n\nTo meditate in God's word. I have learned that we live from every word that proceeds out of God's mouth.\n\nPatience, Persistence, Practice, Focus, Relax.\n\nYou need to relax the body and the mind.\n\nYou need to focus on your meditation object at all times while meditating.\n\nYou need to be patient.  Don‚Äôt try to force something to happen.  If something is going to happen, it will.  Be patient.\n\nBe persistent in the practice.  Don‚Äôt give up just because of one bad session, or not being able to relax or focus.  Keep practicing.\n\nFinally it takes practice to master meditation methods.  So no matter what your mind and body is telling you, keep practicing.  Even if you think you reach a higher level, keep practicing.\n\nAnd that it is better to have a good 5 minutes than a bad hour of meditation.\n\nI can do something better with my time\n\n\\* Loving Kindness : Be gentle with your self &amp; forgiving\n\n\\* Observe or feel your thoughts : Mind always drowned in thoughts, be conscious of these\n\n\\* Feeling Breath &amp; Other meditation techniques bring you back to normal or even make you cheerful when you are stressed or tensed.\n\n\\* There is no running away from thoughts, you can always feel, acknowledge and come back\n\n1. meditation isnt a path to enlightenment, it‚Äôs a time for you to experience it.\n2. it‚Äôs ok to have thoughts and feelings, they are just appearences in the experience.\n\nThe root of suffering is craving and aversion. The less I crave the freer I am. and the freer I am the better of a person that I can be because it is easier to act in a selfless way. Mindfulness helps with this as one observes their experience constantly and is able to catch the conditioned reactions to life before they control a person in their natural course.\n\nThat we are just an I/O function\n\n&gt;\"All your thoughts are garbage. You may think that some of them are good but you should consider the possibility that all your thoughts are garbage.\" ~Ajahn Sumedho\n\nYup, just a bunch of nonsense really.\n\nWhenever I get in the void, I here a little voice whisper,  ‚Äúit‚Äôs ok.‚Äù\n\nI will never be wise but according to my\nReadings, does that make me wise?\n\nThoughts are approximations , whatever we think ourselves are is one of those attempts at thought , energy is everything.\n\nHappy cake day  üéÇ !\n\nI remember I was meditating once in the midst of people and it provided me some food for thought. I remember thinking that we conventionally tend to think of things that are moving, humans, as more phenomenologically relevant to us in some way. Meditation lead me to want to invert this by prioritizing the unmoving, the material and basic, as the object of my attention for at least some time. This might be a bit strange or hard to explain lol.\n\nNon-dual self, consciousness as the activity itself to directly experience; real Being or true self. (Not to be confused for pure consciousness).\n\nThe first; Energy is Energy. Whether someone gives you negative energy, it's your choice to accept it or convert it. If it's positive, the same. No matter what, Energy is the same. Whether you give all of your energy or none of it. It's up to you how you wish to accept it.\n\nThe most life changing. Perspective and Understanding will always change if either is even slightly moved. It's like moving a ball. Nothing stays in the same exact spot once you take into consideration a different view outside your own. Being able to step away from yourself and view the situation will lead to more logical thinking but also put into perspective the emotional aspect.\n\nThe most recent... Self Love/Respect is not Selfish. Boundaries are important and more important than that are the healthy relationships you have between your mental, physical and emotional states. If you're around people who make you feel uncomfortable, who put you down or are generally overall toxic, you have the choice to not associate with them. Whether you're willing to or not is up to you. Nobody else.\n\nEn mi nuevo camino a la meditaci√≥n y en lo que estoy estudiando ahora Regresiones a vidas Pasadas en sanar mi alma, todo lo que no le encuentro soluci√≥n en este plano, es por alg√∫n trauma que viv√≠ en otra vida\n\nI've learned that life goes on without me. I am not that important. Since then, I stopped beeing so serious about everything üòÅüôè \nNevertheless, theres nobody coming to save me. Me alone is responsible for my actions and therefore outcomes.\n\nWhen it comes to anxiety, resistance is the fuel to the fire.   The key to overcoming anxiety is to see it as an opportunity to become familiar with it.  So you embrace it and the anxiety (because it wasn‚Äôt want to be embraced) goes away.\n\nThat forgiveness of others brings forgiveness of self.\n\nThat I am God.\n\nTo let go. Let go of the expectations of others. Let go of everything you think you know about the world and embrace change. Be led by spirit/your higher self/your spirit guides.\n\nA different you is on the other side of a thought.\n\nEverything and everyone is connected.\n\nLong ago, I was a competitive skier. The very act of skiing for me was highly meditative. It‚Äôs always been difficult for me to calm my busy mind so Meditation was never easy. But when on skis, I found it highly meditative and at the end of a day, I was calm, peaceful, and quite happy and fulfilled. I suppose a successful Meditation does the same.\n\nMaybe this is what you would call a moving Meditation. Physical activity always does it for me. And sport does it for me in a major way. Takes my mind off everything but that one activity.\n\nOne of the most profound lessons I've learned from meditating is the power of presence. Meditation has taught me to fully experience the present moment without judgment, which has significantly reduced my anxiety and stress. Instead of getting caught up in worries about the future or regrets about the past, I've learned to find peace and clarity in the here and now.\n\nI‚Äôve learned to be my own solace. Not everyone is going to be along for the ride with you forever. Connections sometimes are only temporary and help propel you to the next stage/s of your life. \n\nUltimately, you are the only person that can decide how you feel and how you respond. \n\nThe more you back away from life and look at it from a distance, you become more at home in yourself. I think that‚Äôs a huge piece to the puzzle of life and greatly affects how the rest of your days unfold.\n\nIm not a good teacher, but everyone can see how to make life a little better\n\nI was exposed to transcendental meditation when I was 15. I just had my 62nd birthday. Here is what I learned-\n\n‚Ä¢the older I get, I acknowledge I don‚Äôt know much\n\n‚Ä¢the longer I meditate, the more I realize I am a creature thirsting for knowledge/experience \n\n‚Ä¢knowledge/experience does not give me peace or give me happiness\n\n‚Ä¢I understand I am not my mind, thoughts, or emotions, but to experience them gives me the ability connect to others\n\n‚Ä¢because of TM and the experience of feeling my soul move independently from my body, I fear death less\n\n‚Ä¢fearing death less doesn‚Äôt make me better than anyone else nor does it give me wisdom or happiness or peace\n\n‚Ä¢that listening to others is a skill I will have to constantly work on\n\n‚Ä¢my body and my spirit/soul are together but not the same. \n\n‚Ä¢my body is my friend, not my enemy\n\n‚Ä¢there is a difference between the oppression from society and the oppression from my thoughts/emotions\n\n‚Ä¢expressing love, in all its forms, is my life‚Äôs journey\n\n‚Ä¢my connection to nature and animals, gives me contentment and peace\n\n‚Ä¢it‚Äôs so easy to let time go by and wish we had made time for special people in our lives. Wishing is not doing.\n\n‚Ä¢while time is a construct that we experience like a river going only one way, it is finite and I want to stop taking it for granted by focusing on the past or future (a lesson I struggle with daily)\n\n‚Ä¢the older I get, I acknowledge I don‚Äôt know all that much\n\nI didn‚Äôt struggle with meditating as a 15-16 year old but as a 62 year old, I do. Impatience hurts me more than I‚Äôd like to admit. My experiences as a physically abused child, let me have more compassion for people with anger issues while addiction was ruling their lives, but I don‚Äôt tolerate people who attempt manipulating others very well.\n\nI‚Äôm still learning how to not fall into the habits of a child surviving violence, or the overreaction to people who are bitter and angry.\n\nTwo of the things that have benefited me the most from meditating that aren‚Äôt just effects are:\n\n1. We are all just passing time in life.\n2. Everyone suffers, some of us suffer happily.\n\nthis too shall pass\n\nThe purpose of life is to experience it.\n\nThat I am awakening to who I really am deep inside underneath all the past conditioning.\n\nEvery desire is painful eventually\n\nthe anxiety is just a feeling, it‚Äôs not permanent.\n\nThat my mind will shamelessly lie to me over and over again even with the same lies from days, weeks and months ago\n\nThe frequencies are portals üíé ‚ú®Ô∏è\n\nWISE, I don‚Äôt know?\nLESSON, I don‚Äôt know?\n\n\nI and my father are one! \nThe truth that is true always!\nAnd \nOnly Love is Real!\n\nThat the only thing that matters during meditation is observing without a goal. It took me years to believe this. I always wanted to become more satisfied or more relaxed or better able to concentrate, etc. I can now let that go and since then I have automatically been more satisfied, relaxed, etc. A very special experience is the realization that nothing is necessary during meditation.\n\nThe other thing I've noticed is that the benefits of meditation appear at unexpected times in my life. For example, that it is easier for me to let go of something or that I can suddenly become absorbed in the moment.\n\nTo relax keep the focus &amp; breath it‚Äôs meditation in action that‚Äôs the wisest thing I‚Äôve learned in yoga\n\nThat I can get deep into my soul.\n\nTo learn to be with your emotions eather than running away from them which solves no problem. Learned that I have made excuses to not deal with problems. Its still just has hard the difference is i deal with them.\n\nThe lessons I've learned from meditating is that you can control your body, self heal and correct. I'm no longer taking blood pressure medication because I brought it down to normal. My eye site has gotten better by making my body correct itself. I'm currently concentrating on correcting my constant heartburn and I'm half way there. You mind can make your body do pretty much whatever you need it to. It's the most incredible thing once you learn to heal yourself. That's the wise lessons I've learned thru meditation.\n\nMeditation is lack of thought. How can you get inspired?, when you‚Äôre not thinking?. There‚Äôs no lessons to be learned.\n\nThat most things are best left unsaid."

All of a sudden my vision went totally white and sparkly. I just felt pure heavenly bliss and as if my entire identity and sense of self disappeared completely and I was just bubbling energy and awareness.

    "all_comment_text": "How lovely. I just read a fart related meditation story recently that I can‚Äôt stop thinking about. Maybe you‚Äôve heard it, but I‚Äôll paste it here: \n\n‚ÄúSu Dongpo was an avid student of Buddhist teachings. He was quick-witted and humorous; as a Zen Buddhism follower he was very serious and self-disciplined. He often discussed Buddhism with his [master], Zen Master Foyin. The two lived across the river from one another‚Ä¶ One day, Su Dongpo felt inspired and wrote the following poem:\n\n‚ÄúI bow my head to the heaven within heaven\nHairline rays illuminating the universe\nThe eight winds cannot move me\nSitting still upon the purple golden lotus\n\n‚ÄúThe ‚Äòeight winds‚Äô in the poem referred to praise, ridicule, honor, disgrace, gain, loss, pleasure and misery ‚Äì interpersonal forces of the material world that drive and influence the hearts of men. Su Dongpo was saying that he has attained a higher level of spirituality, where these forces no longer affect him.\n\n‚ÄúImpressed by himself, Su Dongpo sent a servant to hand-carry this poem to Foyin. He was sure that [the master] would be equally impressed. When Foyin read the poem, he immediately saw that it was both a tribute to the Buddha and a declaration of spiritual refinement. Smiling, the Zen Master wrote ‚Äúfart‚Äù on the manuscript and had it returned to Su Dongpo.\n\n‚ÄúSu Dongpo was expecting compliments and a seal of approval. When he saw ‚Äúfart‚Äù written on the manuscript, he was shocked . He burst into anger: ‚ÄúHow dare he insult me like this? Why that lousy old monk! He‚Äôs got a lot of explaining to do!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúFull of indignation, he rushed out of his house and ordered a boat to ferry him to the other shore as quickly as possible. He wanted to find Foyin and demand an apology. However, Foyin‚Äôs door closed. On the door was a piece of paper, for Su Dongpo. The paper had following two lines:\n\n‚ÄúThe eight winds cannot move me\nOne fart blows me across the river.‚Äù\n\nOh my God this is so hilarious. Best story I‚Äôve read today.\n\nI heard this story before. It's the Zen way of testing people who claim themselves to have reached enlightenment, or a higher level of spirituality. Is that what you're trying to imply, OP? üòÅ\n\nHehe. No way do I seriously claim to be enlightened. Just got a little taste of heaven that day.\n\nNo worries. You did very well, congrats!

    "title": "I started meditating 65 days ago",
    "body": "Some background to me is that I am separated from My wife and pending a divorce. She had two affairs and honestly our marriage was very volatile. Once everything broke apart back on May 17th I was going through a major depressive episode and was at a point honestly of considering abandoning my faith. Had a brother in Christ recommend doing breathing exercises and meditation. Started doing that 65 days ago went to see my PCP before that and he put me on trazodone. Since then I've noticed significant changes in myself where I seem to not fly off the handle at all I am a lot more calm and even intense situations where other people might be even more so angry I find myself extremely level-headed now. I then eventually stumbled across this subreddit and got very curious and started reading. I've been mixing my faith with the meditation and breathing exercises and I've noticed now it's much easier for me to recall things I've read in the scriptures as well as just being more mindful. I wanted to say that this subreddit has been very helpful and honestly I used to mock the whole meditation and breathing exercises a year ago thinking it was laughable and now I realize honestly I was a bit of a fool for mocking it. Needless to say I am looking forward to the journey and so far I've meditated for over 30 hours and told him the past 65 days. I had the same friend tell me of the wim Hof method and the box breathing method. Are there any other methods or avenues I could use that might be a benefit?",

    "all_comment_text": "üëèüëèüëè   Bravo ‚Äî meditation is the single most valuable activity for the betterment of EVERYTHING and EVERYONE.\n\nNo advice, but want to appreciate your heartwarming and honest post. Make yourself at peace¬†\n\nCongratulations! Many people don‚Äôt give meditation a chance, but it‚Äôs great to see how it‚Äôs making a positive difference in your life, especially given the challenges you‚Äôve faced.\n\nNow that you‚Äôre into meditation, start with the basics and explore one method at a time‚Äîdon‚Äôt overwhelm yourself by trying everything at once. Begin with the easiest techniques to implement first. Here are a few suggestions that are tailored to your needs. While they resemble traditional practices, they‚Äôve been modified for ease and effectiveness. Not everything will work for you, but you‚Äôre likely to find some useful techniques among them:\n\n1. Mindfulness: Focus on the present moment without judgment.\n\n2. Kindness: Practice showing kindness to all living beings.\n\n3. Body Scan Meditation: Pay attention to areas of tension in your body, starting with your face, and try to relax your facial muscles.\n\n4. Journaling: Write about happy experiences and positive feelings.\n\nIt‚Äôs fantastic that you‚Äôre approaching this journey with an open mind. Keep exploring and adapting practices that work for you, and feel free to share your experiences with the community. We‚Äôre all here to support each other!\n\nMy only advice is to stop counting. Cultivating a beginner mindset is a pretty useful tool \n\nTomorrow is Day 1\n\nI agree however, It‚Äôs good use to have as a scientific journal for yourself, and potentially others if you wish to help.\n\nIf you want to take it a step further, definitely recommend ice baths. Trains your mind during high physical stressful situations. And the hardest part is the first 45 seconds.\n\nSounds like you're really turning a corner there.  IMO there were quite a few meditative practices passed along with the Faith via monastic orders. Unclear to me how or why this faded. There are even records of a medieval transcendent practice 'Realm of the unknowing' it seems kinda an odd idea today but there it is.\n\nI am 30 weeks pregnant and boarder line suicidal thoughts having to leave my narc husband. Not suicidal because of just the grief of the relationship but there was so much damage done to me and I cannot comprehend how I am going to be okay. I need to start medication and mediation again, when I was meditating regularly I did have some amazing breakthroughs and was able to cope with my big feelings\n\nPlease meditate, it helped me with my pregnancy during Covid. 20 minutes is good. \nLove &amp; peace.üíï\n\nQuick and easy trick to use in any situation is simply three breaths. It gives a simply way to stop the chain of thoughts that we generate in every moment. That break in the self-generated thought chain or \"mind movie\" is the key. Realizing that we are self-generating a lot of our current trauma due to how we use our unresolved past trauma as a guide to get though similar present trauma, we allow ourselves to stop for the space of three breaths. We can remove traumas we bring from the past and see the moment for what it is, without the added load of that past baggage. Rinse and repeat as often as you realize that you mind is running in that mind movie. It really helps stop that immediate, emotional response and we see the moment that is occurring with clarity and for what it is, and only what it is, without adding the past into it.\n\n1st breath is used to realize that we are running a mind movie in our thoughts and to stop.\n\n2nd breath gives us a place to simply stop and be for a moment.\n\n3rd breath we pick up the moment that is occurring again.\n\nI‚Äôm in a similar situation to you. I have also taken up meditation and found it has helped to calm my mind. Peace and love to you brother. üôè\n\ndo whatever you feel that will help you! presence is always key!\n\nSo happy to hear that you choose this path. This is a [very basic meditation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwQkfoKxRvo) that will surely help you in current life situation.\n\nAccording to recent research, lengthening the outbreath is the most effect breathing exercise -- https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-athletes-way/202301/how-longer-exhalations-and-cyclic-sighing-make-us-feel-good  \n\nThe simple, preliminary zen practice of breath counting 1 to 10, odd breath in, even out, starting over if you lose count or when reaching 10, will develop concentration and settle and calm the mind early in any meditation, prior to more advanced practices like shikantaza (just sitting with open awareness) and self inquiry. Combining counting breaths with letting go and relaxing into an extended outbreath is especially effective for calming and relaxing the body/mind. It activates the parasympathetic nervous system and calms the \"fight of flight\" of the sympathetic system. For more on that technique and other tips and tricks. google my name and find Meditation Basics. Although it is based on many decades of zen practice and training, that article is non-sectarian and can be adapted to any belief system. I think you'll find it helpful.\n\nEverything on the Sadhguru app!! Isha Kriya 2x daily for 40 days changed my life.\n\nThat‚Äôs amazing! Welcome!\n\nGo for 1 to 2hrs walk every day. That will relax you more. You will feel at peace. Continue to take your prescribed medications.\n Pray in am when you wake up &amp; at pm before you fall asleep. Thanks God for all your blessings &amp; strength to be able to deal with all life challenges.\n\nMeditation is great to organize your life &amp; set a plan to be a better person.\n\n4-7-8 - inhale four , hold 7 , exhale 8. Purse you‚Äôre lips and exhale everything when you do it\n\nNothing but respect for you.\n\nCheck out DrJoe Dispenza on UTUBE. He has meditation videos plus so much information about how the mind works, healing ( science based)Great info.\n\nWhichever method you find, I think you should integrate your faith with it. I listed some ideas below, but if you pray for something, be it happiness, health, or wealth, do so at the start of a session then pivot to your method:\n \nYou could use an icon of big J or a crucifix as a focus to look at in a gazing meditation.\n\nYou could repeat a prayer or a psalm like a mantra while in a meditative state (Rosary beads are designed to help you keep track). \n\nYou could contemplate a favorite verse, read it a few times until it's fresh in your mind then hold it there."

    "body": "Here's my list: Zhuan Falun - Li Hongzhi; Power vs Force - David Hawkins; Letting Go - David Hawkins; Map of Consciousness Explained; The Untethered Soul - Brian Singer; Breaking the Habit of Being Yourself - Joe Dispenza\n\n# 1. [**Zhuan Falun by Li Hongzhi: A Journey into Spiritual Awakening**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2243352.Zhuan_Falun)\n\n*Zhuan Falun* is often described as a profound exploration of spiritual practice, specifically through the lens of Falun Gong (also known as Falun Dafa). Authored by Li Hongzhi, the book outlines the core principles of Falun Gong, which is a meditative practice rooted in ancient Chinese traditions. Unlike typical self-help books, *Zhuan Falun* isn‚Äôt solely about personal growth in the material sense; instead, it focuses on cultivating moral character, inner strength, and enlightenment.\n\nThe book emphasizes three primary virtues: *Truthfulness*, *Compassion*, and *Forbearance*. These values are intended to help practitioners align themselves with higher truths and live in harmony with the universe. While reading *Zhuan Falun*, one is encouraged to look beyond surface-level self-help tips and consider how developing virtues impacts one‚Äôs spiritual journey.\n\nWhat makes *Zhuan Falun* stand out is its emphasis on moral discipline as the foundation for true wisdom and peace. Li Hongzhi guides readers to reflect on their lives in a way that encourages self-purification and the release of negative emotions and habits. For those open to deepening their spiritual practice, this book offers a unique pathway that has helped millions globally.\n\n# 2. [**Power vs. Force by David R. Hawkins: Understanding Energy Levels in Human Consciousness**](https://books.google.rs/books/about/Power_vs_Force.html?id=EzBqBgAAQBAJ&amp;redir_esc=y)\n\nIn *Power vs. Force*, Dr. David R. Hawkins introduces a fascinating concept of consciousness that has intrigued readers for years. Hawkins, a psychiatrist with a background in spiritual study, created what he called a \"Map of Consciousness,\" which categorizes various human emotions and states into levels that range from shame and guilt at the lower end to enlightenment and peace at the higher levels.\n\nThe book's central thesis is that true power comes from high-vibrational emotions like love, joy, and peace, while \"force\" comes from lower, fear-based emotions like anger and pride. Hawkins presents a scientific and metaphysical framework that blends psychology, spirituality, and quantum mechanics, appealing to both scientific and spiritual readers. By understanding where we sit on this map, Hawkins believes we can gain insight into why certain experiences feel life-affirming, while others leave us drained or unsatisfied.\n\nA popular concept in *Power vs. Force* is that each thought and action emits a frequency, which either aligns us with higher energies or keeps us in states of negativity. The book teaches readers how to elevate their consciousness to access genuine power and wisdom, which Hawkins describes as the real source of human potential.\n\n# 3. [**Letting Go by David R. Hawkins: A Practical Guide to Emotional Freedom**](https://jordanbates.life/letting-go-david-hawkins/)\n\nBuilding on the principles in *Power vs. Force*, Hawkins‚Äô book *Letting Go* offers a more practical approach for people seeking to free themselves from emotional suffering. *Letting Go* focuses on a technique Hawkins calls the ‚ÄúLetting Go Technique,‚Äù which encourages readers to observe and release emotions rather than suppressing them or identifying too strongly with them.\n\nThis book resonates with those who feel weighed down by unresolved emotions. Hawkins emphasizes that emotions themselves aren‚Äôt the problem; it‚Äôs our attachment to them that creates suffering. By understanding and releasing these attachments, we can begin to experience emotional freedom and greater inner peace.\n\nIn *Letting Go*, Hawkins provides examples from his clinical work and personal experiences, making the process relatable and accessible. Readers who follow his guidance often find themselves feeling lighter and more open to new possibilities. Hawkins‚Äô advice in this book is practical and grounded, offering a path that feels achievable even in the midst of life‚Äôs challenges.\n\n# 4. [**Map of Consciousness Explained by David R. Hawkins: A Detailed Guide to Higher Consciousness**](https://www.everand.com/book/565837296/Summary-of-David-R-Hawkins-s-The-Map-of-Consciousness-Explained)\n\n*Map of Consciousness Explained* dives even deeper into the concepts Hawkins introduced in *Power vs. Force*. This book serves as a companion and guide, offering readers an in-depth look at each level of consciousness and practical advice on how to move from one level to the next.\n\nThe book includes explanations of various emotional and mental states, from guilt and apathy at the lower end to peace and enlightenment at the highest end. Each level corresponds to different experiences and beliefs, offering a tool for introspection and growth. Hawkins also provides advice on how to overcome common emotional obstacles and reach higher states of awareness.\n\nFor readers who have a genuine interest in understanding consciousness, this book acts as a roadmap. Hawkins uses relatable examples and a straightforward approach to make his insights digestible, so even complex ideas feel accessible.\n\n# 5. [**The Untethered Soul by Michael A. Singer: Breaking Free from Inner Limitations**](https://harvest-therapy.co.uk/portfolio-items/the-untethered-soul-by-michael-a-singer)\n\n*The Untethered Soul* by Michael A. Singer is a beautifully written exploration of consciousness and self-awareness. Singer offers insights into the ways we create mental limitations that hold us back. The book challenges readers to question the voice in their head, which is often the source of self-criticism and doubt, and learn to observe it without getting caught up in it.\n\nSinger‚Äôs message is one of inner freedom. He suggests that when we stop clinging to our thoughts and fears, we allow life to flow more naturally, leading to a sense of peace and connection. Singer uses the metaphor of ‚Äúuntethering‚Äù oneself from these inner limitations to emphasize the possibility of breaking free from the mental patterns that confine us.\n\nOne of the book‚Äôs strengths is its practical approach to mindfulness. Instead of a purely philosophical approach, Singer encourages readers to observe their thoughts and emotions as they arise. For anyone who wants to experience more peace and clarity, *The Untethered Soul* offers actionable insights that can be applied in everyday life.\n\n# 6. [**Breaking the Habit of Being Yourself by Joe Dispenza: Creating Lasting Personal Change**](https://www.valpeo.com/insights/must-read-books/breaking-the-habit-of-being-yourself-how-to-lose-your-mind-and-create-a-new-one-joe-dispenza/)\n\nIn *Breaking the Habit of Being Yourself*, Dr. Joe Dispenza combines neuroscience and quantum physics with the practice of self-transformation. Dispenza believes that our thoughts and emotions shape our reality and that by changing our inner world, we can manifest real change in our lives.\n\nThe book explains that by understanding how our brain creates habits, we can learn to break out of old patterns and rewire our minds. Dispenza provides exercises, meditations, and visualization techniques designed to help readers shift their mindset and create new, positive habits. His work resonates with readers who are looking for a science-backed approach to personal growth.\n\nDispenza‚Äôs insights appeal to those who have struggled with breaking negative habits or patterns. The book explains that change requires commitment and awareness, but also shows that it‚Äôs within reach if we‚Äôre willing to make the effort. For anyone curious about the connection between mind and matter, *Breaking the Habit of Being Yourself* is an enlightening guide to self-transformation.\n\n# Conclusion: Six Books, Many Pathways to Inner Growth\n\nThese six books each provide a unique perspective on personal and spiritual development. Whether you‚Äôre drawn to ancient spiritual teachings in *Zhuan Falun*, the science of consciousness in Hawkins‚Äô works, or the practical psychology of Dispenza and Singer, each author offers valuable insights into achieving greater inner peace, self-awareness, and purpose.\n\nWhat unites these books is a common goal: helping readers release limiting beliefs, overcome emotional barriers, and ultimately, lead happier, more fulfilled lives. Exploring these diverse approaches can open doors to self-understanding, making it easier to find a method that resonates with you. If you‚Äôre ready to embark on a journey of self-discovery, these books offer profound guidance and practical tools to help you along the way.",

    "all_comment_text": "I Am That by Nisargadatta Maharaj\n\nSeconding this. Nisargadatta Maharaj's directness is something lacking in most of the other books on spirituality. And it helps the fact that him and Ramana Maharishi basically democratized and secularized the wisdom of the Vedas for the non-Hindus.\n\nI felt this book was too  much for me. There are so many question answers and many I am unable to understand. May be I am not yet ready.\n\nauto biography of yogi by Paramahansa Yogananda\n\nWow I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd have to scroll this far to find this. Excellent book. Also Raja Yoga by Swami Vivekenenda.\n\nhow did it change you?\n\n- \"Mindfulness in plain English\" by Bhante Gunaratana (awesome book that is easy to read and also quite easy to understand. Mindsets, practices, clear and concise writing on what mindfulness and meditation actually is etc, great stuff).  \n\n- \"The Power of Now\" and \"Practicing the Power of Now\" by Eckhart Tolle.   \n\n- \"Become what you are\" by Alan Watts (quite a tough read imo, I think his seminars where much easier to digest. Honestly, watching some of his seminars before reading the book helped me get into it. I think mostly because I then read it with his jolly voice and demeanor &gt;_&gt;).  \n\n- \"The Alchemist\" by Paulo Coelho (\"combining magic, mysticism, wisdom, and wonder into an inspiring tale of self-discovery\" pretty much sums it up well. It's one of those \"everyone has to read it at least once in their lifetime\" books and I wholeheartedly agree)\n\nBe here now - Ram Dass\n\nThe Cosmic Serpent - Jeremy Narby\n\nStalking the wild pendulum - Itzhak Bentov\n\nseconding be here now\n\nAutobiography of a yogi by P. yoganand ji and \"Grist for the mill\" by Ramdas ji is a must read\n\nSiddhartha\n\nThat book was exactly what I needed at the time I read it. Maybe I'll give it another go\n\nIt grows with you. It‚Äôs one of those books that you can read at different points of your life and find wisdom within that wasn‚Äôt evident before.\n\nI read this book but was unable to get out what its trying to convey. I felt I was reading through a story but was unable to take any golden nuggets from it. May be can you summarize what it tried to convey in a nutshell?\n\nI've read this years ago and what stuck to me was how his spiritual path was unique to him. He had highs and lows, yet in the end he found a middle ground, balance if you will. He was meant to walk his path, go through the journey and through it he understood life and its meaning. It's a simple lesson that I took from it but it really changed how I viewed life. I was about 16 when I read it and before I did I thought the only thing that mattered were grades and being a good citizen. Over a decade later I still remember to keep myself grounded but at the same time hold my core values and spiritual self at the forefront.\n\nthanks for reply :)\n\nThe ending is incredible\n\nI loved it üôè\n\nIt‚Äôs such an incredible book. Should be on every school curriculum. The only right path is your path.\n\nThe power of now! Reason why I got it, the author was on the verge of suicide and had his great awakening when he realized those thoughts and feelings wasn‚Äôt him, not identified with the identity (illusion)\n\nI listened to the audio of Untethered Soul and just loved it!\n\nAlso the book Between Death and Life by Deloris Cannon (I did audio again) reinforced a lot of my spiritual beliefs.\n\nYesss I also love The Surrender Experiment\n\nCame here to say this.\n\nI even summarised the book into a 20 min rapid re-installation guided meditation audio track.\n\nIt is one of the best books out there. Michael A. Singer, not Brian Singer. \n\nSorry about the remark, maybe OP could change it in case somebody will look up the book.\n\nMan‚Äôs Search for Meaning by Viktor E. Frankel.\n\nMichael Singer has a YouTube channel with tons of great videos on different topics, I recommend checking it out if you enjoyed the book.\n\nThank you, I‚Äôll do that!\n\nHis follow up, Living Untethered, which is more autobiographical, is pretty incredible as well. He build an extremely profitable business unrelated to his spiritual teachings which I wasn‚Äôt aware of.\n\nPower of Now by Erkhart Tolle (First time readed it when I was 16, and it had a hudge impact on interest to \"dig deeper\" for understanding mind, perception, and \"reality\")\n\nYoga vasistha. (Book is not really about \"spirituality,\" but you can find it on shelfs with other books in that genre. I'm studying it for about 8 years). \n \nThere are a lot of good books out there! ‚úåÔ∏è\n\nPower of Now teaches you the fundamental skill of being in the present moment and bearing witness to your mind. Found me in a dark time and changed my life forever.\n\nPower of now seconded! \n\n\"Prometheus rising\" by robert anton wilson, the legend, may also be extremely interesting to some people here. Especially those who wish to make their practice more \"practical\" in the material world, instead of the \"passive\" buddhist approach of only/mostly meditation. It even applies to people simply interested in the psychology of our minds, or those who are skeptical or reductionist about spiritual practices, since the book only has theory and practical instructions with no dogma. \n\nIt is frequently recommended to beginners to understand r/chaosmagick ;)\n\nyes\n\nThe Power of Now is what started it ALL for me. My spiritual journey, my meditation, then yoga journey. The OPENING of my closed mind.\n\nsame here! and meditations by marcus aurelius. not spiritual per se but enjoyed reading some stoic philosophy and incorporating it with spiritual practices\n\n‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nThe power of now\n\nBraiding Sweetgrass by Robin Wall Kimmerer, When Things Fall Apart by Pema Chodron\n\ni enjoyed \"miracles of love\" and \"be here now\" by Ram Dass\n\nand ive heard at least 2 of Eckart Tolle's audiobooks.\n\nthe AMTF books are nice aswell\n\nsoon i'll hopefully start reading the life story of Peter Mt. Shasta\n\nWise Heart by Kornfield. my first intro to Buddhism\n\nPatanjali yogsutra\n\n‚ÄúMastering the core teachings of the Buddha‚Äù, by Daniel Ingram.\n\nAs someone coming from the zen tradition I lacked the deep theory needed in order to do the practice without a teacher. That particular book filled most of the theoretical gaps and was also invaluable during my experience of ‚Äúthe dark night of the soul‚Äù stages. It‚Äôs likely I would have quit meditation if I didn‚Äôt know what was happening at the time. In the book everything I experienced was described in detail which was VERY comforting.\n\nI also think my progress would have been quicker I have had read ‚ÄúThe mind illuminated‚Äù as a beginner and not as an advanced practitioner. I basically had to invent that wheel on my own which in retrospect was unnecessary.\n\nLastly (this is not a book) the research of Martin Jeffery tied everything together. You can go read about layers and locations free online. That reading put all previous theory learned in the correct context and ironed out the last wrinkles. In and of itself own it‚Äôs probably not enough but it‚Äôs a great resource if you already have had many profound experiences and theory.\n\nFinally I want to mention Frank Yang. His YouTube videos helped me put many of my previous experiences in place without any traditional language making it easier to map my own experiences which I would describe in a similar way Frank does.\n\nMiracle of Love üß° by RamDas\n\nZen And The Art Of Motorcycle Maintenance by Robert M Pirsig\n\nThe Confessions of Aleister Crowley by Aleister Crowley\n\nPrometheus Rising by Robert Anton Wilson\n\nThe Tao Te Ching by Lao Tzu\n\nThe Seth books. Rudolf Steiner books. John Mack books.\n\nI have heard of the Seth Books, which I have yet to invest in, but could you elaborate on the other two authors?\n\nmy spiritual awakening was really spurred by my reading two books by John Mack on the abduction experience and it‚Äôs relation to heightened spirituality. Particularly, ‚ÄòPassport to the Cosmos‚Äô. The Steiner books like, ‚ÄòHow to know higher worlds‚Äô it‚Äôs probably 100 years old and is one of the foundational books of the more recent spirituality teachings. I wouldn‚Äôt start there. kinda like reading Shakespeare for spirituality lol.\n\nHaha, I love Shakespeare.\n\nI'll invest in all three, why not.\n\nCheers man.\n\nThe Presence Process by Michael Brown.¬† I think a lot of books just give different angles of explaining the same things.¬† This one I have gifted to others and will continue to recommend.¬† It's not just the concepts, but also tools that are approachable.\n\nA Course in Miralces...as well as The Untethered Soul: The Journey Beyond Yourself.\n\nYes. A course in miracles. Also the Bhagavad Gita.\n\nThe Untethered Soul. I am actually sitting here reading for the 4th or 5th time.  And each time, it feel new to me. I keep spare copies and give them to ppl.\n\nIn Love With the World, Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche.\n\nZhuangzi.\n\n[Eternal Tarot by Glorian](https://glorian.org/books/the-eternal-tarot/tarot-arcanum-33-alliance) has been the most influential book of my life\n\nIt contains the universal meaning of numbers\n\nWhen you start to comprehend the meaning of numbers in daily life you can guide yourself better to awaken consciousness day to day (the daily bread that we live for)\n\nYour being actually talks to you all the time with the numbers that you see in your day, not only number, random things that happen or come across \n\nCannabis is another amazing book\n\nMore sources:\n\n[Pranayama](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKEYNRCTdHvZrD4JszbTJo6C-le5xSe6k&amp;si=vL432cuGKa4GUEGl) \n\n[Sexual transmutation by Astral Doorway](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbZsCM6xnLIUGQcs_E43BJtC4gUoS6VO1&amp;si=GiRE9TGTMGLr4dGK)\n\nhttps://youtu.be/w0HjkOfAceU?si=RkI-5M6ZYxSdgn9S\n\nhttps://youtube.com/@ryancropper?si=Nc6cJnLIR1Qw9ZgL\n\n[Spiritual Warrior Experience](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6kYZuBDBCOadhRfL1PH6GZdv5HWQsKrJ&amp;si=ybJE9DXhT-SUMp_E)\n\n[The Three Mountains](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCetVV-Qpsq-GiWZVlKndpMQE3AQ34XVc&amp;si=E0NCz5x32Yvtmyh7)\n\n[Glorian](https://glorian.org)\n\n[Books](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10ikTukSELd7JABjBRcFT_2K7AMYljNCZ?usp=drive_link)\n\n[Gnosis Arizona](https://youtube.com/@gnosisarizona?si=JO5yHgnci_i-UeZm)\n\n[Wisdom of Gnosis](https://youtube.com/@wisdomofgnosis?si=jo5NrFMoachpTwqr)\n\nAlthough I don't consider it a spiritual book, it did connect me with myself.\n\nThe Tao Speaks (which is an interpretation of Tao Te Ching)\n\nStumbling into Infinity. An incredible book by Michael Fischman. Such directness and authenticity. The only book that made me cry.\n\nConversations with God from Neal Donald Walsch\n\nDid you read them all?\n\nI only read the 1st and the 3rd. They are both very very inspiring. \nThe 1st one is introduction to the idea of oneness, and we are god itself. \nThe 3rd one is about how to see daily life in the spiritual light.\nI think the 2nd is more about relationship.\n\nAutobiography of a Yogi Book by Paramahansa Yogananda :)\n\nThe Seth books, Michael newtons books, Robert Monroe, Wayne dyer, ram dass, P‚Äôtaah books and paramahansa Yogananda\n\nThe art of dying by Osho.\n\nThe Religion of Tomorrow by Ken Wilbur\n\nA Course in Miracles by Helen Schucman\n\nAwareness by Anthony De Mello\n\nSecrets of Divine Love: A Spiritual Journey Into the Heart of Islam\nBook by A. Helwa\n\nThe power of now by Eckhart Tolle\n\nWaking Up by Sam Harris\n\nThe Science and Practice of Humility by Jason Gregory. I‚Äôve used this more as a reference. I jumped around lot and made a lot of annotations. I found the material familiar and casual to follow. It references further reading and practice, so it did not read like a know-it-all self help book.\n\n‚ÄúAwareness‚Äù by Antony de Mello\n\nThe Way of Mastery - Shanti Christo Foundation\n\nLife of the masters. Stuff about qi gong and chinese medicine\n\nI saw your post over in the insomnia sub and I have to say that your advice was excellent.  I also think it often takes a long time to become aware of that stuff.  In particular, what you said here:\n\n&gt; As opposed to simply obsessing over sleep, and getting frustrated and obsessed because ultimately what you're doing when you're like this is just increasing stress, anxiety, exhaustion..\n\nThat is mindfulness in action.  Being aware of your thoughts/emotions/actions which contribute to the anxiety.\n\nI was like you, I also had profound insomnia for many years (not as long as you - mine was 5 years).  I eventually learned, accidentally, that I needed to address the anxiety because that's what was perpetuating the insomnia.  The amazing thing is that what worked for me was Lateral Eye Movement.  It's so simple.  Free.  I heard about it on a Huberman podcast.  It still blows my mind that after all the drugs and herbs and supplements working with 18 doctors that this simple brain hack is what pulled me out of that nightmare.\n\nI really appreciate you sharing what you found with others.  I think that's very valuable.  I have a paragraph on \"Mindfulness\" over at the [page](https://drugfreesleep.org/) where I documented my own journey and it reflects aspects of what you said.\n\ni'm happy you enjoyed my post and you were able to find a cure. i'll read that page but ultimately i think the realization that i'm trying to share, is that insomnia and anxiety aren't \"mental\" stuff purely in your head, it's a bunch of symptoms of your current state. Mindfulness is indeed capital but i'm trying to go one step further into saying that if you have insomnia, AND also if you experience anxiety, it's not an intellectual thing, it's because you're stuck into that disease exactly the same that when you catch a cold.  \nSo think about it as energy, physiological process into which you're stuck and you need to gradually unstuck yourself and it absolutely canno't be done instantly, because just like a cold it takes time.\n\nPeople overly intellectualize anxiety, insomnia, think it's in \"their head\", while actually it's in their whole body, it's as real as a virus, even physiologically you can observe stuff and measure material signs that represent those issues. \n\ni have lost my trust in modern medical doctrine long time ago and i'm glad i did\n\n\"Christ Returns - Reveals Startling Truth\" for the breakdown of religious dogma and path to enlightenment.\n\nThe forty rules of love\n\nBe Here Now by Ram Das.  It showed me where to look inside to start to become an aware, compassionate human.\n\nTao de Ching, the Kybalion, poetry of Rumi\n\nThriving Through Uncertainty: Moving Beyond Fear of the Unkown and Making Change work for You, by Tama J. Kieves. She has written several other books I have yet to read, and I hear they're all really good.\n\nLife beyond suffering. Not sure if you‚Äôve ever heard about Kinzer on Instagram, but his book is changing my life. It‚Äôs a 60 days guided meditation practice but every day there is a new page with a new topic e.g. what is the ego, how to let go of judgement etc. and every day you have to write 5 things you‚Äôre grateful for in life and 5 affirmations and meditate (starts with 5 minutes and at end of 60 days you‚Äôve worked your way up to 35). I‚Äôm at day 23.\n\nI‚Äôve read lots of books but i found that they focus mostly on theory rather than practice. This book is changing my life. It‚Äôs my greatest treasure :)\n\nThe Presence Process, Michael Brown\nWim Hoff Method\nCollected Works, Ramana Maharshi\nVarious discourses, Nisargadatta\nStillness Speaks, Eckhart Tolle\n\nIndeed, Joe Dispenza has touched the Source. \n\nLoved the written distillation of Joseph Campbell‚Äôs PBS series with Bill Moyers, ‚ÄúThe Power of Myth.‚Äù  In many ways, a culmination of his life‚Äôs teachings. \n\n‚ÄúZen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance‚Äù served as an introduction to philosophy, as well as allowing the reader to peer into another‚Äôs mind as they lose touch with reality.  An interpretation of Quality. \n\nThe Tao of Pooh.  Seriously.  When I was studying neuroanatomy one summer, consumed this as water in a dry desert.  Needed it. Bad. \nLater, Tao Te Ching.  \n\nThich Nhat Hanh. Pick any book. Made Buddhism accessible for me.  His quotes have clarity, gravity and cogent simplicity.  I still use them in practice. Judging by the groans of my kids, I employ them too often at home.\n\n‚ÄúThe Power of Now‚Äù by Eckart Tolle. It was such a simple concept that I had to take breaks to process the information üòå transformational.\n\n&gt;Zhuan Falun - Li Hongzhi\n\nExcerpts from Wikipedia:\n\n&gt;Falun Gong (UK: /Àåf…ëÀêl än Àà…°…í≈ã, Àåf√¶l-, -Àà…° ä≈ã/ FAH-lun GONG, FAL-, -‚Å†GUUNG, US: /- Àà…°…îÀê≈ã/ -‚Å†GAWNG)[1] or Falun Dafa (/Ààd…ëÀêf…ô/ DAH-f…ô; lit. 'Dharma Wheel Practice') is a new religious movement.[9] Falun Gong was founded by its leader Li Hongzhi in China in the early 1990s [...]\n\n&gt;Led by Li Hongzhi, who is viewed by adherents as a deity-like figure, Falun Gong practitioners operate a variety of organizations in the United States and elsewhere, including the dance troupe Shen Yun.[14][15] They are known for their opposition to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), espousing anti-evolutionary views, opposition to homosexuality and feminism, and rejection of modern medicine, among other views described as \"ultra-conservative\".[16][24] [...]\n\n&gt;Li Hongzhi taught that homosexuality makes one \"unworthy of being human\", creates bad karma, and is comparable to organized crime.[96][97][98]: 285  He also taught that \"disgusting homosexuality shows the dirty abnormal psychology of the gay who has lost his ability of reasoning\",[99][97] and that homosexuality is a \"filthy, deviant state of mind\".[98]: 283 [40] Li additionally stated in a 1998 speech in Switzerland that the gods' \"first target of annihilation would be homosexuals\".[97][100][101][...]\n\n&gt;The performance arts group Shen Yun and the media organization The Epoch Times are the major outreach organizations of Falun Gong.[11] Both promote the spiritual and political teachings of Falun Gong.[20][21][22] They and a variety of other organizations such as New Tang Dynasty Television (NTD) operate as extensions of Falun Gong. These extensions promote the new religious movement and its teachings. In the case of The Epoch Times, they also promote conspiracy theories such as QAnon and anti-vaccine misinformation[129] and far-right politics in both Europe and the United States.[27][29][40] Around the time of the 2016 United States presidential election, The Epoch Times began running articles supportive of Donald Trump and critical of his opponents.[39][40] Falun Gong extensions have also been active in promoting the European Radical right.[29]\n\nMysticism, by Evelyn Underhill.

I didn‚Äôt expect it to stick with me like it has. If anyone‚Äôs into exploring that kind of stuff, it‚Äôs on Amazon as an eBook.\n\nI have a major problem with meditation as spirituality. It is causing me great discomfort in my journey because meditation resonates with me at a core level. I believe in it. It attaches me to the spiritual world. That said. All of the so-called practitioners are not people I want to be like. I am not interested in renouncing my belongings and wealth, wrapping myself in a toga, and kissing babies. I like my fight and grit and determination and drive and spirit. I like those things about myself and they seem to be incompatible with meditation but I know they are not, I am living proof of that. I feel like for all the good meditation does it's proponents lose sight of real life. We don't all strive to be ghandi. I am a meat eater, I will elbow you in the paint. That's life.\n\nyour purpose is different than others thats all. Obviously theres no way we can live a human life without some desires/attachments/ego. meditation is about moving towards that perfect oneness. we're all heading there eventually but some of us want to be more prepared or get a head start and be able to call on it during our daily lives. \n\nFor me I like to let go of everything during my meditations, and then have it kind of resonate throughout the rest of my life.\n\nVedanta Treatise by A.

    "all_comment_text": "Few weeks ago main said \"Refine obsession into discipline and refine discipline into joy\"\n\nI think this is just a human fascination with paradoxes manifesting as a thought. In meditation our subconscious desires are released, and thought is often how that happens.\n\nThere‚Äôs some genius accessed when the mind is quiet. It‚Äôs a common thing for scientists to have answers not when thinking about a problem but when doing something unrelated and relaxing afterwards. The famous scientist Maxwell said ‚ÄùWhat is done by what is called myself is, I feel, done by something greater than myself in me‚Äù\n\nMaybe that universal truth sits in the silence, and thoughts are like waves we can see in the still waters of our consciousness.\n\nWe know what we know because, said John the Baptist, \"There comes a man after me, who is preferred before me, for He was before me.\"\n\n\"He will increase and I shall decrease,\" said John the Baptist.\n\nit does, but that doesnt mean it cannot be profound or contain a seedling of wisdom that can change your path. What is spiritual doesnt have to be magical, it can also be something mundane.\n\nWow\n\n[deleted]\n\nWow\n\nWowser‚Äôs Trousers\n\nSuch wow many cool\n\nWow\n\nHoly shit! ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nYup. Once I suddenly got the download that said, as if someone was talking to me, ‚Äòwhisper into nature and you will hear all the answers‚Äô\n\nDid you get answer??\n\n+1\n\nMine said, ‚ÄúHow can you pray for peace, when you yourself cannot forgive?\n\nForgive yourself or others ?\n\nThere is no difference.\n\nTrue\n\nBrilliant and true!\n\nThat‚Äôs how I know it didn‚Äôt come from me.\n\nThe Lords prayer.\n\nHow do you forgive?\n\nI once asked myself \"How much suffering must I endure until I relinquish all control\".\n\nAre you still suffering??\n\nNot from the same 'happening', but in terms of me still being knee deep in Buddhist samsara then yes, I most certainly am.\n\nImagine a control console with tons of buttons and knobs and instruments, and see yourself in control of it, worrying over it, tightly gripping it. Then decide to let go, take your hands off, and relinquish control\n\nSomebody once told me I was like a gunny bag filled with emotions with a tiny escape valve at the bottom.\n\n\"I am always with you\" was mine a few months back.\n\nWow\n\nIt seems you are still seeking. Aren't you, aren't you??\n\nI was searching for an answer and I got this\n\nMeditation is a good thing then.\n\nYes.     \n\nIt is not rare for intense intuitive stream of consciousness to ‚Äútake over‚Äù me after meditating. I open my notes app and it just (for lack of a better term) pukes outta me. I will have fully fleshed out paragraphs upon paragraphs\n\nSpills out of you.\n\nRumi once wrote \" What you are seeking, is seeking you\"\n\nIt's how it is, imho - you find what you look for - sooner or later.\n\nI don't get this one.\n\n‚ÄúWhile he was still speaking, a bright cloud covered them, and a voice from the cloud said, ‚ÄúThis is my Son, whom I love; with Him I am well pleased. Listen to Him!‚Äù‚Äù\n‚Ä≠‚Ä≠Matthew‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠17‚Ä¨:‚Ä≠5‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠NIV‚Ä¨‚Ä¨\n\nyes it‚Äôs the universal intelligence, these thoughts come when you raise your vibration (or whatever you want to call it)\n\nWow really\n\nmakes sense to me.\n\nYes- this has happened to me a few times, but I always had the distinct feeling/impression it was some higher part of me that needed to jump in and say something. There was no connection to yoga, however.\n\nWow\n\n[deleted]\n\ndid you watch gladiator before bed? because maximus says that to his soldiers\n\n[deleted]\n\ni think its a slight variation on a quote attributed to marcus aurelius &amp; stoicism. so maybe it was some roman philosopher chiming in.\n\nWow\n\nOMG, thanks for posting.  I thought I was cuckoo. Clear as day I heard a whisper \"Always Visualise Before You Begin\". I have it written on the lockscreen of my phone.\n\nDid you do it ??\n\nI truly do before starting tasks I deem important üòä\n\nNice\n\nIs that just a sentence that comes into your mind, or did you also get a \"revelation\" on how true that statement is?\n\nI don‚Äôt know.suddenly pop up in my mind and never heard about this quote before\n\nYes, pretty rare for me but sometimes I cry with joy at how profound they are\n\nNice\n\nI think that's an insight.\n\nInsight??\n\nLike you said, it was a feeling you felt, but that feeling provided deeper knowledge of yourself and the world around you, one of many will happen. What you can do is write it down in your journal, it will help you integrate it in your mind and also process what you felt... It will also provide you with more insights.\nI call it insights, because it's a kind of intuitive knowledge you acquire, a visceral feeling that after processing you can put into words what it means. It happens to many who meditate and introspect, your the first one I know that happened to have that through yoga, but it is a meditative practice, so it's not far off. Take it as a sign you're in line with your practice and integrate your insights, it will lead to many more.\n\nThank you so much.\n\nI once got ‚Äûallow yourself to speak, as i speak through you and you speak through me‚Äú\n\nWow\n\nLong ago after my meditation session just randomly I opened my note app and wrote:\n\n\"The lava is rising, the volcano will erupt, before it melts your life away, make the best out of it.\n\n\nThe lava is rising, the volcano will erupt, it erupts within you and leaves you with an explosion of love.\"\n\nNice\n\n\"Be still and know you are God\"\n\nWe are god??\n\nThat's what they say\n\nOf course we are :)\n\nIn the car today on the way to work I felt this impression and spontaneously said out loud that I had everything I could ever want and its source is within me.\n\nNice\n\nYes, I consider it my intuition or higher guidance.\n\nNice\n\nMy last download was \"surrender to the infinite\". Happened to be in a Buddhist temple. But have also gotten messages during my thai massages when I tried to stay still and present.\n\nDid you surrender?\n\nI‚Äôm also curious if you were able to surrender? I had a similar experience before I started meditating and I‚Äôm so lost and stuck atm. Would love to know more if you feel comfortable sharing. üôÇüôèüèª\n\nYup I asked what am I and a female asserted you are life.\n\nWow\n\nYes, whenever I meditate after yoga I get things like this that clearly come to mind in silence. I love yoga and everyone should at least try either yoga or mediation! I was surprised when I started to feel an awakening and almost stopped but pushed through and it is amazing what yoga does for ones spirit and one's physical being.\n\nTrue.yoga is life.\n\n[deleted]\n\nI learned from yoga school\n\nYoga, meditation,  prayer, it all works..\n\nTrue\n\nYea.  I believe that‚Äôs why they call body scanning meditations ‚Äúinsight meditation‚Äù because the more I connect to my body, the more insights I get.\n\nI love doing all kinds of meditation and body scans have by far been the most insightful.\n\nNice\n\nyes\n\nY‚Äôall need to meditate more\n\nReally\n\nSometimes, when we are deeply dissociated from our feelings by conditioning, one that manages to cut through the cloud of noise, a stark signal like no other, as clean and clear as the air we breathe, can scarcely be recognized as the self, and seems a voice from beyond.\n\nWhatever I am, I promise you, this voice is yours, and it is a feeling born of immense need.\n\nI‚Äôm amazed\n\nThat‚Äôs good.\n\nHow do you feel about these words?\n\n&gt; Seek for nothing and you will find everything.\n\nDo you now seek for nothing? And why?\n\nTbh I don‚Äôt know man. I felt so right when these words came to my mind. I was looking for an answer like why I‚Äôm shaking while meditating this and that, why I‚Äôm the only one doing yoga around me?? Why I‚Äôm so different from my surrounding. So I guess this the answer.\n\nSo‚Ä¶ feeling a bit different from others, maybe a little self-conscious, and wanting some kind of resolution, or explanation, or meaning, or who even knows. Then comes the thought, ‚ÄúSeek for nothing and you will find everything.‚Äù\n\nLet‚Äôs unpack the first clause, seek for nothing.\n\nThe verb, to seek, is to go looking for something, and there are exactly two possible motives. Why does one look?\n\nThe noun, nothing‚Ä¶ is not. This is a very important thing, and so simple that it is difficult to understand. Nothing is not. Does that make sense? Do you know exactly what nothing is? Have you ever seen it? Have you ever come close to it? Have you ever felt it?\n\n[deleted]\n\nNice\n\nI wouldn't over think it\n\nTrue\n\nclarity\n\n[removed]\n\nWe do not allow links only.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Meditation) if you have any questions or concerns.*\n\nYes. This idea has impressed itself on me several times in my life and I have heard/read the same concept in a couple of forms from different people.  My folks understand the \"why\" of it in this way: \"Nature's wealth at once has its bounds and is easy to¬†procure; but the wealth of vain fancies recedes to an infinite¬†distance.\" - Principle Doctrine 15. So while this is a beautiful spiritual sentiment it also has a solid materialist basis.   Both sides of the coin are shiny :-)\n\nOk\n\nNice\n\nYeah\n\nYup yup yup. I write mine on post its so I can come back to them later.\n\nWhat is yours??\n\nI had a few times where the voice said to do nothing and see the truth. eventually i understood what it meant when i could actually see nothingness - a black void - unexplainable matter.¬†\n\nAfter I began to see it, the voices disappeared.¬†\n\nNice\n\nAnd that's basically all you need to know. When you drop the seeking you can be happy with each moment. ‚ô•Ô∏è\n\nThanks\n\nnot if you still have attachments. (buddhist 4 noble truths)\n\nIf you do, you're still seeking.\n\nRumi also used to say the same.\n\nWho‚Äôs rumi\n\nHe is a poet, a mystic. Google who is Rumi and you will get his biography and even his works\n\nThat‚Äôs a really intriguing thought! It sounds like you had a moment of insight. Sometimes, in the quiet of yoga or meditation, we get profound realizations. The idea of ‚Äúseeking for nothing‚Äù often means letting go of expectations and finding peace and fulfillment in the present moment. Have you experienced similar insights before?\n\nYeap. I got something before as well\n\nYes.\n\nBe equanimous when you have nothing and when you have everything.\n\nYou will find it when you don't think about it dominantly.\n\nI have been there and I have also felt that sometimes.\n\nWow really\n\nYes.\n\nSorry to be honest.\n\nThis happened to me, during the early stages of meditation as a beginner.\n\nIt‚Äôs been almost 3 years.ive been practicing yoga.\n\nGood to hear.\n\nWhat's the frequency, of your yogic practice?\n\nyes.. our merit can be spontaneously turned to wisdom when we are caring for ourselves, when we are ready\n\nNice\n\nThe natural condition of the mind is clarity and openness, like empty space. But that original clear awareness gets lost under the weight of habitual reactions and patterns of thinking that have been acquired over time. \n\nAwareness is usually identified with an individual self, separate from everything else. But that belief is misplaced. What‚Äôs separate is the mental and physical phenomenon that make up an individual life. Awareness itself is neither separate or not separate, existent or non-existent. When it‚Äôs relaxed and turned inward it‚Äôs clear and open, devoid of characteristics.\n\nThe way to identify with nothing is to simply let go of external concerns and return to our ever-present clear awareness. Although it‚Äôs nothing, it turns out to be the source or essence of everything, past, present and future ‚Äî while still remaining transcendent and undefiled. \"Nothing\" or emptiness can be cultivated -- http://www.frogzen.com/meditations/\n\nNice\n\n[deleted]\n\nNop. I don‚Äôt smoke.\n\nyes, I believe that is a form of our higher + collective consciousness coming through after we have created space in our beings \n\nlife is not always so much about doing, but about being and listening \n\nIf it feels aligned, save that message and apply‚Ä¶.or just let it go ‚ú®‚ú®\n\nWow. Nice.\n\nnever realized so many people treat themselves to a fortune cookie after meditating\n\nLol\n\nYes I have, https://app.mindfulcopilot.com/workshop this helped me explore them a little more\n\nThis is reminiscent of the Zen saying \"Seek nothing, just sit\"\n\nNice\n\nYes. Mine was: everything you will ever need, you already have them.\n\nWow\n\nSometimes these are just another bit of crud from our heads and we should ignore them. But I think from the way you said it it's more of a subconscious insight that has expressed itself in your consciousness through language. And that might be your subconscious or the subconscious that you and I share with everyone else, The Collective Subconscious.\n\nIt also reminds me of something a very young Yogi told me when I was struggling after a divorce. I happen to meet him while visiting Cob√† gave him and his friends a ride back home to Tulum. In exchange they gave me these chocolate squash sesame balls that I basically lived on for weeks and they were so good I would reserve them for when I was having interviews. \n\nHe said, \"Find meaning in one thing and you will find meaning in everything.\"\n\nNice\n\n‚ÄúIt is not the man who has too little, but the man who craves more, that is poor. ‚Äù\n‚Äï Seneca\n\nTrue\n\nMine said: healing begins when there is tranquility\n\nNice\n\nThis is a channeled message I wrote down the other day\n\n\"There is nothing to do, nothing to learn, nothing to seek.\n\nSeek and ye shall find. And when you seek nothing, you will find nothing.\n\nDo you understand?\n\nYou seek nothing by realizing you are nothing. You realize you are nothing by realizing you are everything.\n\nYou realize you are everything by looking upon all that is around you with the same loving gaze I look upon you with now.\"\n\nü§îüôÑü•±\n\nYes, I have learned to talk to my subconscious and my body also knows more than yourself\n\nReally?? How??\n\n[deleted]\n\nWow\n\nYoga (Bhagavad Gita) teaches this. Give it a read.\n\nSounds like someone received a download üòÅüôåü´∂\n\nDownload??\n\nI mean that is one of the teachings of the Bible. And in fact a lot of religions seem to share a similar sentiment. If there is in fact a universal power of some kind... I mean call me nuts but it makes sense their messages would be pretty similar though time right?\n\nReally??\n\nBuddhist sutras say \"To seek is to suffer. To seek nothing is bliss.\"\n\nJesus preaches about not worrying about tomorrow because tomorrow will worry enough for itself\n\nTrur\n\nI had this happen a few years ago, and the phrase was ‚Äúremember how to die.‚Äù It totally freaked me out, but then the more I reflected on the phrase, the more beautiful and clear and relevant it seemed.\n\nTrue\n\nNot a professional but sounds like hallucination or delusion. Are you religious or believe in crystals having powers by any chance?\n\nNop. Do you do yoga and meditation??\n\nI meditate, although I don't do yoga. I'm physically active since I'm a regular gym goer and was a taekwondo athlete back in uni. \n\nThe voice in your head is - this might come as a surprise but its \n\n just you. \n\nnot an intruder or a spiritual BS.\n\nIt's your ego. It wants you to do what you want and be free.\n\nIt's not an awakening, or some indication of being special. There's beauty in being human, you will seek to thrive and be life-giving and this isn't by any means thanks to any one but every cell in your body wanting to not just survive but be better.\n\nTrue\n\nHave you ever felt that??\n\nI had something somewhat similar. I went through a very difficult time and would meditate for over two hours. I‚Äôd experiment with different visualization strategies, reading books, I took a reiki course, etc. i don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôd call them ‚Äúvisions‚Äù because I‚Äôm not sure I understand what a vision is. But images would pop into my head of family members. One that died over 30 years ago. One that died but I never met (that one freaked me out).  I heard dreamlike pieces of advice. Some of what I heard I‚Äôll keep private but one was ‚Äúbe patient.‚Äù It felt so eery, but fine like not quite unsafe, but sexy , like I heard it from another realm or place. It was so moving I had to talk to a counsellor about it. I think about it a lot.\n\nWoohh nice,similar experience.when I was like 6 or 7 yrs. I saw a dead snake near by my house and few month ago while doing yoga and meditation it just popped up out of nowhere.\n\nDo you have a lot attachment on what you are seeking?\n\nI really don‚Äôt know\n\nMaybe ask your self why you are doing meditation?\n\nI started doing yoga and meditation just because it‚Äôs good for health.\n\nDo you have health issues?\n\nStrangely enough I just finished meditating a bit at the end of the day today and this exact thought word for word popped into my head for no reason\n\nWow really??\n\nYea, I guess it‚Äôs a pretty common thought in terms of being insightful but not sure why it just came up.\n\nI was doing yoga once and I became concerned about whether I was doing it right, and a voice came to me and said \"if you're doing it at all, you're doing it right\".\n \nI know it wasn't my voice, it was softer and kinder\n\nWow nice\n\n\"You have to be nothing and yet everything at the same time\"\n\nI did find that nothing space in me, but I'm still unraveling the whole meaning. I feel the gist of what it means though\n\nNice\n\n[removed]\n\nThanks\n\n No. After yoga I think, ‚Äúwow I really needed that.‚Äù\n\nYes you need it\n\nNo not all that‚Äôs your self conscious bs ing you\n\nI have experienced something similar. \"Searching\" feeds on ideas, whereas real attention is directed to reality, to where \"things\" really are - so I can only find them with attention.\n\nNice\n\n Yes. It is the path of least resistance. Effort is the enemy of good, and trying is a state of stress. \n\nLetting the reigns go to the unfolding is faith.\n\nHmm\n\n[deleted]\n\nWow\n\nSeek ye first\n\nAfter meditation, I always had these thoughts  It's who you meditate with that causes this.\n\nI think it's your higher self. I would totally go with it. Your higher self has all the answers. What a blessing.¬†\n\nMine said \"Be happy, be sad, be scared, be it all! Because you ARE all!\"\n\nOur mind is part is a part of the physical body, which allows us to experience through our 5 senses.  \nYou're separating the physical mind, connected to our senses, from the eternal spiritual mind or consciousness. This consciousness transcends the physical body, existing beyond life and death. It's a timeless, spiritual essence that makes us who we are.  \n\nThe physical mind acts as a veil, separating us from our eternal spiritual mind. This veil can create illusions, obscuring our true nature. By lifting the veil, we can connect with our spiritual mind, revealing our authentic selves."

Helps understand yourself in relationship to not just your own past, but the pasts of those around you, how that affects your present, and possibly future.\n\nThe untethered soul changed the way I look at myself I highly recommend it .\n\nI read The Surrender Experiment by the same author, and it had a significant impact on me as well.\n\nAgree! Really helped change my perspective.\n\nGreat book.\n\nX\n\nI love this book so much, then found Living Untethered and it's also amazing.\n\nTao te Ching by Lao Tsu\n\nJourney of Souls - Michael Newton\n\nAfter my husband died suddenly and tragically, I went on a deep dive and this book was very helpful.\n\nSo very sorry for your loss.\n\nThank you\n\nDamn, I‚Äôm sorry you lost him but could see how that book could be helpful. I‚Äôm glad you were able to find it! Wish nothing but the best for you.\n\nThank you, I appreciate it.\n\nautobiography of a yogi\n\nThat was my first introduction to spirituality\n\nI couldn't get through it because the autobiographical details were too dry and boring. I tried skipping to the sections on kriya, but they weren't concrete either.\n\nYou obviously missed all the bits where he was ejaculating\n\nWhy Buddhism is True by Walter Wright. It takes a very science oriented look at meditation and the Dharma. Its as much about neuroscience as spirituality. And learning about the mechanics behind meditation, helped me get way better at it.\n\nThis is a great book!\n\nGotta mention The Mind Illuminated because it's a phenomenal meditation guide. My favorites aside from that one are Letting Go: The Pathway of Surrender (David Hawkins) and Living Untethered (Michael Singer). They have both been instrumental to my progress and path.\n\nLots of great books mentioned in this thread, but I have to second your enthusiastic recommendation of The Mind Illuminated. For those that are serious about pursuing one-pointedness-of-mind meditation it‚Äôs an essential resource. I‚Äôve been meditating for over 35 years and in only a few months my practice has deepened more than in the last decade. It‚Äôs an extremely practical book with detailed insights and instructions, and a model of how the mind works from moment to moment that maps well to meditative experience and of course the rest of the text.\n\nIt‚Äôs also a [free pdf download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16pKrr74_4bnYc6GqQeScou9riGhxtst4/view) and there‚Äôs a sub: r/TheMindIlluminated.\n\nThank you both am looking forward to it. Currently the audio book is free on audible (they rotate the freebies).\n\nThe Four Agreements\n\nZen Mind, Beginners Mind by Shunryu Suzuki and The Heart of the Buddha‚Äôs Teachings by Thich Nhat Hanh.\n\nZen Mind is right up there for me too. Great audio book available on that as well.\n\nBe Here Now was probably the one that influenced me the most early on. These days it‚Äôs more academic works that influence me, but also things like the writings of the early monastic Christians.\n\nI had a similar experience. Ram Dass and *Be Here Now* were my entry into this world.\n\nI have especially gotten exceptional value from reading, multiple times, the section called *Cookbook For A Sacred Life*. My goal was to understand why those involved in monastic life followed the practices that they did (ie. what practical purpose did they serve), with an eye towards incorporating, in miniature fashion, their daily routines. This has taken my practice beyond just meditation and it continues to become more and more a part of my daily existence.\n\n&gt;early monastic Christians.\n\nPlease tell me Thomas Aquinas is there in the list.\n\nI wouldn‚Äôt consider Thomas Aquinas early in the least, but he‚Äôs definitely on the list.\n\nWho are up on that list? Would definitely like to know more. I only know about Thomas Aquinas thanks to Alan Watts, and that's the extent of knowledge of Christian mysticism.\n\nI wouldn‚Äôt consider Thomas a mystic, he‚Äôs much more of a philosopher/theologian.\n\nIf you want older stuff, look into Anthony The Great (On the Character of Men and on the Virtuous Life), Evagrius, John Cassian, St Mark.\n\nThere is of course St. Augustine, perhaps one of the most influential figures in the West. Look at Confessions, or City of God.\n\nIf you‚Äôre interested in perhaps the greatest genius of scriptural interpretation, look at Origen of Alexandria. A real genius and a monastic.\n\nMore recently, my favorite is Bernard Lonergan. You can find lots of his essays, but his main books are Insight or Method in Theology. Pretty incredible stuff but very, very dense.\n\n&gt; I wouldn‚Äôt consider Thomas a mystic, he‚Äôs much more of a philosopher/theologian.\n\nAh. I see. Interesting. Will look up both of them. Thanks for the suggestion! :) I should also look up this topic on Let's Talk Religion on YT!\n\n&gt;but his main books are Insight or Method in Theology. \n\nDownloaded this on a whim. Two pages in, so far it has been an interesting read!\n\nThat influenced me also, after I'd spent months inspired by Ram Dass's \"Journey of Awakening: A Meditator's Guidebook\".\nRealizing I need to read more material again to help myself rebuild the self-discipline for a solid practice.\n\nAnother great Ram Dass book.\n\nWhat early monastic writting by Christians did you like?\n\nIf you look at one of my replies, I gave a list!\n\nStarted with random lecturers by Alan Watts on YouTube. Then started listening to audio books on Ramana Maharishi's teachings, and finally found home in the words of Nisargadatta Maharaj.\n\nZen and the art of archery.\n\nWhere ever you go, there you are\n\nGreat book\n\nWaking Up - Sam Harris\n\nThe Power of NOW.\n\nEckhart Tolle\n\nFirst book to completely change me. But his voice in audiobook makes me want to peel off my skin lol.\n\nLol... because he sounds like he is perpetually constipated?\n\nBro that is absolutely the perfect way to describe it lmao\n\nI‚Äôve lost count of how many times I‚Äôve read/listened to The Power of Now. This book found me at just the right moment and never stops being a source of inspiration\n\nThe prophet by Khalil Gibran is amazing.\n\nThe Prophet is quite profound for a book that is so popular, but it lacks the richness of Siddhartha by Herman Hesse. Please do give it a try. The thing I like the most about Siddhartha is that towards the end, it is a masterpiece of \"Show but don't tell\" maxim. It doesn't try to preach how to conduct yourself in the least bit, but gives you an amazing perspective of the inner transformation that occurs to someone nearing enlightenment.\n\nI love Siddhartha.\n\nAlso not to forget about the taodeqing\n\nA truly unique and poetic and great book\n\nSinger‚Äôs Untethered Soul and Brach‚Äôs Radical Acceptance.  Palmer‚Äôs Let Your Life Speak has a vocational angle.\n\nThe first Spiritual book I read was Eckhart Tolle's \"A New Earth\".  \n\n\"Surrender Experiment\" by Michael Singer.  \n\n\"Autobiography of a Yogi\" by Paramahansa Yogananda \n\n\"The Kybalion\"  by The Three Initates\n\n\"Falling Into Grace\" by Adyashanti\n\nThe Power of Now- Eckhart Tolle\nChanged my entire way of thinking\n\nTao Te Ching and Second Book of the Tao(both Stephen Mitchell, but have read several other translations) I‚Äôve honestly read them each easily 25+ times over the last 11 years and they still leave me with a-ha moments. Just when I think I got it, they reveal something deeper. They seriously changed my life. I can‚Äôt believe I was the person I was prior to them finding me.\n\nSame here.\n\nZen and the art of Motorcycle Maintenance\n\nThat was a great book ‚Äì a good exploration of spirituality and modern life\n\nFour Agreements\n\nThe Law of One / Ra Materials\n\nConversations with God by Neal Donald Walsch\n\nThis\n\nSiddhartha by Hermann Hesse, Jonathon Livingston Seagull by Richard Bach\n\nCame here to say Siddhartha!\n\nThe creative act by Rick Rubin was real good\n\nThe Book of Not-Knowing by Peter Ralston sent me down the path.\n\nThe Spirit of Spinoza by Neal Grossman.\n\nOld Path White Clouds\n\nCommenting to follow as I need guidance and don‚Äôt know where to begin\n\nTao of Physics and the Way of Zen when I was a high school senior. Boom!\n\nAll books by Dr Brian Weiss !!! Transformative.\n\nEvery time I reread \"The Miracle of Mindfulness\" by Thich Nhat Hanh it rekindles my meditation practice and I feel that I have a completely different outlook after reading it. I am more aware of what I am doing in the present moment and I feel that I can at least try to turn most tasks into mindfulness practice.\n\nJonathan Livingston seagull.\n\nWherever You Go, There You Are\n\nStress less, accomplish more by Emily Fletcher had a huge influence on my meditation technique. Highly recommend!!\n\nStar Wars for me. I like the way the force is described\n\nHave you read any of Joseph Campbell‚Äôs work? Star Wars is based on it.\n\nNo I have not. Would you mind sharing some titles I could check  out?\n\n‚ÄúThe Hero‚Äôs Journey‚Äù and ‚ÄúHero With A Thousand Faces‚Äù. You could also Google Joseph Campbell Star Wars and go down that rabbit hole.  Enjoy!\n\nA wanderer‚Äôs handbook By Carla Lizbeth Rueckert (L/L Research)\n\nGene Keys by Richard Rudd.\n\nI listened to a podcast with Richard Rudd on it and been curious about the Gene Keys, especially as I‚Äôve been consulting the I Ching. What‚Äôve you learned/gained from it? How does it relate to meditation?\n\nThe technique associated with the Gene Keys is contemplation, but there are also lots of references to meditation. I've gained deeper insight into my shadow patterns, and how they can be seen as a lower frequency response to something higher hiding inside me. All is energy, so with more awareness on your shadows when they show up, you can eventually transform them into \"gifts\" or higher frequency responses. I've seen that happen in my life while contemplating the Gene Keys. üòä\n\nYou'll See it When You Believe by Wayne Dyer is probably considered more of a self-help/motivational book, but reading that book at age 16 opened my mind and got me interested in spirituality, meditation and self-realization.\n\nWorks by Ram Dass for sure ü©∑\n\nOpening the Hand of Thought is good\n\nA Path With Heart, Jack Kornfield\nThe Power of Now\n\ni learned how to meditate from reading Power of Now by Eckart tolle\n\nBe Here Now\n\nPema Ch√∂dron\n\nLove this question. Will read all the recommendations\n\n‚ÄúWaking up‚Äù by Sam Harris\n\nProbably the Bhagavad Gita, The Lotus Sutra, Zen and the Birds of Appetite, The Seven Story Mountain, The Ramayana is also fantastic.\n\nI love the Bhagwad Gita, took me a long time to actually understand it...but its fantastic! How did you get into contact with gita?\n\nI actually have family from India and it was recommended to me by a guru I studied under. We actually read the whole Mahabharata, as well as several Upanishads. Meditated for 6 hours a day. It was an amazing experience that completely altered my life\n\n[deleted]\n\nHe called himself Kashinath, which is a reference to Shiva. His birth name was Rohan though. He was interesting because he was born to a family that praised Krishna as the ultimate Godhead and still had deep love for Krishna, he said since childhood he dreamt of Shiva and Shakti together as one entity. So he devoted himself to Shiva and teaching\n\nBecoming Supernatural- Dr Joe Dispenza\n\nI just bought that book, but haven't started it yet. Any good?\n\nThe Zen Teaching of Huang Po: On the Transmission of Mind\n\nAshtavakra Gita\n\n[The books of V.M.

It has changed my life in so many ways,\n\nNot a book, but whenever I feel myself falling off the path or need to give myself a reminder as to why it‚Äôs so important, I refer to What I‚Äôve Learned‚Äôs YouTube video titled ‚ÄúWhy Meditate?‚Äù\n\nIt‚Äôs what I send anyone who‚Äôs considering trying it and it has been 100% successful in convincing those people to give it a shot.

But start with the first, ‚ÄúThe Four Agreements.‚Äù This was the first book that ever dared to tell me exactly what I always knew, that which seemed too audaciously simple to ever be possible.\n\nYes, some of it is fluffy, and out there, but that‚Äôs exactly the truth of it, because words are small things. I have seen All, and it is exactly what that dude does his best to describe.\n\nThe second book, ‚ÄúThe Voice of Knowledge,‚Äù would be a terrible place to start.\n\n‚ÄúNotes for the Journey Within‚Äù by far the greatest thing to randomly open up every morning after meditation. Sets you up for the full day üòä\n\nlove ur book choices! \"on the way to satori\" n \"autobiography of a yogi\" are classics. i started with \"the power of now\" by eckhart tolle. it opened my eyes to living in the present. then, \"the heart of yoga\" by t.k.v. desikachar deepened my practice. both books really helped me connect with my inner self n find peace.  \n  \nbtw, have u checked out these amazing buddhist meditation techniques? here's a link \"[https://yuvaap.com/blogs/best-buddhist-meditation-techniques/](https://yuvaap.com/blogs/best-buddhist-meditation-techniques/)\" for u. what book are you reading now on ur spiritual journey?\n\nAnything by Yuan Tze.

    "title": "Something strange happened to me ",
    "body": "I am (was) an avid weed smoker. Yes, I know, but this ties in to meditation, so just brace yourself. \n\n2 days ago, I smoked weed and started meditating, which I was doing for a week at that point\n\nFor some reason, I went deep into a trance and felt locked in. I was seeing my entire life flashing before me, like I was going to die. Except, I was viewing my life in third person. \n\nI was forced to watch through my traumas and abuses and assaults, and I felt something die inside of me. Something negative. like a mix of ego, fear, hate, anger in this strange melange of negativity. \n\nSuddenly i felt so much empathy and love for that kid, that undiagnosed autistic kid who was abused, traumatised, punished, just because he couldn't understand the the way the world works and why people were in a crab race instead of working together. That was the deepest i cried, but the crying happened inside my mind. \n\nI woke up. What felt like a half day long ordeal, in reality, it was just half hour. I was sweaty, but i felt lighter and more positive. Suddenly nothing was angering me, nothing was making me anxious. Suddenly i had lost my craving for weed and porn. \n\nIt felt like i got coated in teflon. Nothing that was said to me felt personal anymore. But on the flipside, I am also having trouble feeling the excessive love that drove my personality, which is a bit too caring and overbearing. The woman i was trying to meet for 2 months to lukewarm replies, suddenly messaged me excitedly to meet tomorrow. I felt nothing replying to her, almost as if a switch turned off in me. This interaction would have sent me over the moon. \n\nAlso deleted someone special but non-existent in my life's number and chats. Felt nothing there either. \n\nI am not sure what happened. Can anyone explain and give some clarity? \n\n",

It is life changing!\n\nRemember, everything that happened to you lead you here to this realisation, you might not have had it if you didnt have those experiences. You are exactly where you need to be right now and you always were. \n\nSelf compassion and love means we can also have real compassion and love for others. I find now I don't judge myself so hard, I also find it easier to remember, during interactions with others, that I don't truly know another person's path in life. I don't know what terrible things might have lead them to be where they are right now, good or bad. They might also have an abused, sad and confused child in them that is running the show to a degree. They have a role to play in the totality of the universe and they might get to this place/realisation too one day. I am just lucky and grateful to be here. \n\nYou are not a victim of your past anymore, you became a survivor and now you are a victor. \n\nDon't limit yourself with that ASD label, don't identify with it too much, only let it be a guide to understand and better yourself. I live like I haven't got it and I don't tell people about it. You are so much more than your label! \n\nNothing wrong with a bit of weed in moderation, it helps my inflexible type thoughts sometimes and see another perspective, helps my life be less black and white if that makes sense.\n\nBeautiful!! I love the idea of compassion releasing me from resentments. Hate is a Boulder you have to drag along everywhere you go. \n\nGreat post\n\nSince no one has mentioned it yet, it seems to me you revisited your inner child and gave them the compassion you maybe hadn‚Äôt received. By loving your past self in third-person you are enabled to see your worth in the present and rework your past trauma into understanding (and maybe one day strength). \n\nPerhaps you are less excited about the girl texting you back because you remembered yourself and had self-compassion (and boundaries) instead of bending over backwards to please someone because you felt unworthy and not-enough. Perhaps I‚Äôm just projecting but as my self-love increases, my desperation to be accepted by others decreases. No one can ever like you enough to love yourself.\n\nPeople in the meditation community often refer to this as shadow work. It‚Äôs difficult to process but ultimately wonderful for the progression of and development of your meditation practice. \n\nI would lean into the meditation and step back from using substances, as you‚Äôve probably gotten past the need for them. Spiritually at least. If you do find you need them again, go with it as you seem to work well with them. Another one known to help with shadow work is Indian pipe stem. \n\nBest wishes on your meditation journey. And remember if all the things we control our meditations shouldn‚Äôt be one. The spirit and God in whatever form should be left to guide and move us into what we need\n‚òÆÔ∏èüíü\n\nWhat is Indian Pipe Stem @UnderSeaRose1\n\nUmmmm‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs complicated to explain lol. It‚Äôs a parasitic flower. It‚Äôs all white and grows in woodlands across the south east USA. Not sure if it goes further than that. People make a tincture of it by covering it with vodka and use 2-3 drops it has a lot of medicinal uses. It‚Äôs worth looking into it from a foraging perspective, but it is endangered still I think so you need to forage responsibly. I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs used for pain as well as other things.\n\n[Indian pipe stem wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotropa_uniflora)\n\nOh and you can cook and eat it like asparagus‚Ä¶ ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüôÉ\n\nWeed is widely used for recreational purpose is actually more of a spiritual herb, mostly people use it for fun and get to get away with it, but when it's mixed with spiritual practices it's completely different thing. What surprises me is so much is talked about it's recreational side but hardly it's explored for spiritual purpose, having said that its widely used for spritual practices in Hindu spirituality but it's knowledge is not in sync with mainstream society.\nAs per my assessment when weed used with spirituality it's a straight rocket to moon.\n\nI personally experienced initial part of  what you felt and I immediately figured out what may come next so I refrained myself from going further for I'm not yet ready to experience what you just experienced.\nI believe when combined with spiritual practices it's better to use psychedelics in limited matter unless the person is looking for a bungi jimp\n\nWhat's the \"next part\"?\n\nfuther disintegration of ego is what i would guess\n\nYou had a beautiful awakening that will be life altering to you, congratulations. Don‚Äôt forget to ground yourself and remind yourself that you are still a person living in a duality world and so at some stage ensuring you don‚Äôt lose a part of your old self is important.\n\nHi this has happened to me! I got high and was able to take off my ego in the most wonderful, beautiful, spiritual way. It was a gift, as, like you, I‚Äôve had some pretty intense trauma and was doing trauma therapy at the time and was really deep in it. For a few days after the experience, I was calm and could see auras. It‚Äôs happened again, but never as intensely as that first time, and it kickstarted a spiritual journey for me that I‚Äôm still on. Shadow work‚ÄîI hadn‚Äôt thought of it that way. But that feels right. Good luck to you. ‚ô•Ô∏è\n\nIt sounds similar to ego death.\n\nIf its like me you will have 3-6years of high driven focused energy.\nGo use it and be your best self, do the most good you can.\n\nYou are more free and more clairvoyant than you used to be, you released yourself from some unimportant crutches and trauma that you hanged onto that might not make sense anymore. \n\nGo do stuff that are really important.\n\nYou = emotional overload. = brain going into distancing safety. \n\nYou have felt too much and for your safety - your brain has decided to hit the breaks and turn to Neutral for a bit. Have a rest. Take a couple days ( if you can) doing low emotion things and slightly increase with easy stuff like watching a comedy movie (that actually makes you laugh) starting with happy stuff like that. If you have saved insta or tik tok or fb vids that made you laugh out loud- watch those again.\n\ngood job because you‚Äôre getting it eventually. so you discovered something pretty huge. you became a higher self for a lower self‚Äôs memory of you which was in pain and you felt compassion for your younger self which alleviated his pain and simultaneously helped you resolved it.¬†\n\n\nthis is what happens to all of us eventually. our higher versions of us from the future are constantly looking back at us to make us feel better and give us love. that‚Äôs because you can love yourself more than anything else and that also means repairing your trauma for past version of you.¬†\n\n\nthe way it works is, everything that is possible happens all at the same time. when you go back to a traumatic memory and change the memories making it less painful and resolving it, this process means that the past version of you, which is now an alternate reality of you , this guy is not you it‚Äôs like someone on the street, but because you‚Äôre showing him compassion he‚Äôs still feeling that in a difficult time and that support for someone else generates good karma for yourself making your life get better and resolving the problem for both versions of you. that‚Äôs just my interpretation of it¬†\n\nThis sounds like it could be a minor psychotic break. You're describing personality changes and emotional numbness that probably needs to be evaluated by a professional.\n\nYou will almost certainly rebound into other mental states in the next few weeks as you process the intensity of the experience.\n\nThat's amazing. I'm so happy for you. Now,your life starts. Enjoy it to the fullest and be happy.\n\nthis sounds similar to what happens for PTSD patients when they do EMDR therapy, so look that up. studies also show that things like yoga and meditation are good for trauma. also maybe consider reading \"the body holds the score\" for more understanding of trauma.\n\nyou are advancing to the next stage. do not mourn the loss of your desperate, attached love. you have been given a blessing, and you must power through, and use this inspiration to build a life that you truly feel.\n\nU sound just like me when I did MDMA a month ago. Everything, down to the tee.\n\nWhat u had was a breakthrough. MDMA shoots serotonin and dopamine to max. Weed fires these two high but not as high as MDMA , but u meditated. Serotonin went into peak levels there.\n\nCongratulations bro, u did it, u saw the truth. We are all meant to love each other. Why Do we kill, manipulate and all the other bad shit? These people have unexamined minds. \n\nHumanism,Stoicism, Buddhism and MDMA and Psychedelic therapy are  the biggest steps to building a communist Utopia. We need to get everyone on the same page first. Sadly that's impossible so I'll try to get everyone close to me on the page.\n\nlol hun, that was a journey. I didn‚Äôt expect communism. üòÄ\n\nCommunism is the goal. Unfortunately greed exists so it gets corrupted.\n\nBut communism is actually a sort of \"heaven\" where everybody loves and works for each other's well being. Sounds fictional till I tried MDMA.\n\nIt can be real, but it will take a lot of work. Work nobody might ever be willing to do.\n\nYour insight that was brought on by chemicals was communism. The first time I did LSD, it was that taxi drivers‚Äô lives were useless. \n\nIt might have felt like an ultimate truth, but that doesn‚Äôt make it so. You can do mutual aid right now, bringing your vision into being, and leave restructuring society for the moment. This is a radical act based in empathy and compassion.\n\nSo lemme get this straight \n\nDid u see all the other things I've said?\n\nHumanism, stoicism, and Buddhism. Not just \"everyone take MDMA durrr\"  u extract and provide the insights of those 3 teachings, put alot of effort into implementing them into the education system. Even in social media adds. We also need more \"waking up\" apps. Stop advertising bullshit and advertise the good shit. All of this sounds very fictional but we can get close if enough people care enough.\n\nFor the very mentally ill or those who really see no hope. They have prescription drug therapy with these various psychedelics and psychoactive drugs, of course there are some unfortunate exceptions . It requires thousands of more efforts, but u can't tell me society wouldn't be better if more people were taught these things from young???\n\nSo many people to their whole lives without learning about any of these things.\n\nYou must be kidding, or at least I hope so. I live in a communist country. You don¬¥t know what are you talking about...\n\nThat‚Äôs never gonna happen. Especially not with your limited life time. there‚Äôs no way that many people can be on the same page. And even if we get close. People would die.\n\nTrying is always worth it\n\nVery interesting story of your experience. I keep forgetting to meditate when high, but the other day I got into a negative train of thought, when another thought hit me to not create stories and go down the rabbit hole with the negative thoughts. So just like in meditation, away they went.\n\nWas it flower or THC-p by chance? I unknowingly used the later and came out of a 3 day blur a different person üòÖ\n\nYou sure what you smoked was weed and not DMT?\n\nFor sure\n\nI can tell you from experience something about what you're going through, even though I've never smoked any plant substance or taken an entheogenic. There is a difference between unconditional love and clinging attachment, which is usually the kind of love we feel if we need a \"significant other\" to complete us. Now you are experiencing a feeling of wholeness, a refuge unto yourself. This is another flavor of freedom. It is not negative in any way. When the right person comes along who does not necessarily excite your libido (which actually can be construed as a kind of nervous restlessness), whom you feel very comfortable with, who you don't \"need\" but enjoy being with, that will be the right kind of relationship for you.\n\nYou might want to listen to Leigh Brasington talking about the jhanas on YouTube: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-8pFbCuTRU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-8pFbCuTRU)\n\nthis sound like an awakening, maybe check out the nonduality reddit.\n\nThere cannot be any experience during meditation because all experiences are of the mind and meditation is beyond the mind. \nIt was the weed buddy.\n\nIt's demonic. Read the book Hostage to the Devil to see how subtle demons can be. Stop meditating, go to confession and either get deliverance or an exorcism if necessary.\n\nIt sounds like maybe you've grown in such a way that you don't need those people's interest to validate you.\n\n\nPeople offering you their company is not automatically more attractive than being in your own company by yourself.¬†\n\n\nMeditation and cannabis can both induce \"altered states\". Perhaps when you combined them this recent time, you produced one.¬†\n\n\nOur human brains (and the brains of many other animals) seek out and utilize altered states for self-exploration, environmental exploration and mental repair/ growth.\n\n\nI don't know you but I'm happy for you.¬†\n\nNigga went threw an acid tripüò≠üò≠\n\non weed?\n\nNah I‚Äôm just playinüòÇ prolly some crazy meditation awakening if ur already high your conscious and energy is already on another field\n\nWhat are u doing here youngster.\n\nMeditation cuh\n\nThat's what's up.\n\nHahaha, the holy za strikes again!\n\nSeriously, how did weed kinda get phased out for it's benefits? It's a Fucking unbelievable therapeutic drug\n\nCheck out Alan Watts and his description of the mystical experience. Some people have them with no drugs whatsoever, so I don't think theres any reason that weed couldn't relax your mind into that state.\n\nMost people have experiences like this while using psilocybin or other psychadelics.\n\nü•πü•π\n\nYou are Awakened.\n\nDone that, been there.  You just learned so much in 30 minutes.  ‚è≥Ô∏è üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\n\nOK...OP?.......go out and do some reading on \"sleep paralysis\".\n\nI think you will find your answer.\n\nAs with what are known as \"near-death experiences\", what has \n\ncommonly come to be called \"sleep paralysis\" is a common state\n\nin which the sleeping mind restrains the body from acting on \n\nmental constructions. Most folks who look into this reflect on the more\n\nphysical attributes like sensing one is not able to move, or is restrained \n\nin some fashion. With the right kind of context some of these experiences \n\nmake for Great Abduction narratives!!  However, what gets overlooked a \n\nlot of times is the concurrent dump of chemicals into the system that helps \n\nsooth anxieties....even at a less-than-conscious level. The fact that you had \n\nunknowingly added to this dump with THC would certainly extend/enhance your\n\nnormative functions. \n\nNothing wrong with mellowing-out. \n\nDuring this election season I know a lot of \n\ngrown adults who could use this perc. \n\nFWIW.\n\nYou are the 11th reincarnation of the dalai lama\n\nAah yes, the lying llama\n\nThink of it this way, before meditation you identified with your past, and that shaped your neural connections. With meditation, you let your nervous system reset and build new associations with \"new\" awareness every time. Which takes you out of your default mode of thinking, then, when you had those memories your body kept score it knew how to react to those situations. Only, it was perceiving the \"then\" as now. Instead, you broke through and reconnected the memories that had been hidden in your defense, subconsciously, which gave way to new off ramps for your body to relieve the pressure and echoes of trauma or experiences you had many nows ago.\n\nOK...OP?.......go out and do some reading on \"sleep paralysis\".\n\nI think you will find your answer.\n\nAs with what are known as \"near-death experiences\", what has \n\ncommonly come to be called \"sleep paralysis\" is a common state\n\nin which the sleeping mind restrains the body from acting on \n\nmental constructions.

I am a huge weed connoisseur so i store it under low moisture conditions. Plus i wouldn't have smoked it if it were moldy\n\nI work in a medical facility for cannabis in my state. The weed I grow has mold on it. All weed has mold on it, but many places hit the weed with doses of radiation to freeze the mold growth. This is an elite facility with all of the top of the line equipment, for reference. It‚Äôs not a well known fact unless you‚Äôre in the industry through. All weed has a little bit of mold and poop particles on it. You just can‚Äôt get away from it. Your phone is covered in worse stuff. If your weed nug is rock hard, you‚Äôve got lots of mold growth. Just a tip of the trade."

    "all_comment_text": "lol just scroll through this sub for a few minutes.  You‚Äôll see them!\n\nOh‚Ä¶ MOST DEFINITELY!\n\nThis is my second time around on this Sub, and I am always amazed at how practitioners respond to things they don‚Äôt agree with. There is such ZEAL for their practice. It‚Äôs ironic that the one tool we use to practice awareness, healing, growth, and detachment is the one thing we might be the MOST attached to.\n\nLook up a book called ‚ÄòCutting Through Spiritual Materialism‚Äô by Ch√∂gyam Trungpa\n\nWill look into it. Thanks for the recommendation.\n\nYep no problem, it‚Äôs a great read and connects with what the original poster is describing\n\nCrazy ü§™ right the ego is sneaky\n\nDefinitely. üëÄ\n\nüòÇüòÇüòÇ so true\n\nSomething something third eye chakra cleansing astral wavelength spacial spirit awakening\n\nAnd porn in the comment history smdh\n\nI've met quite a few characters over the years through meditation, and that includes people who use meditating as a way of validating their ego, feeling superior to others, and bragging about what amazing meditators they are. They can be funny, sometimes annoying, but I try to just let them be who they are and worry about my own practice instead.\n\nHey OP,\n\nMeditation &amp; mindfulness teacher and coach here.\n\nI get where you‚Äôre coming from! It sounds like this guy is really intense about his meditation, kind of like how some Gym-Bros can be. There‚Äôs definitely a precedent for this in meditation; some people get really deep into their practice and can come across with the same kind of extreme mindset.\n\nBut you‚Äôre definitely not alone in feeling like your experience is more about finding peace and self-realization. Meditation is a personal journey, and there isn‚Äôt one right way to experience it. Your feelings of relaxation and insight are just as valid as his more intense experiences.\n\nIt‚Äôs also good to remember that everyone expresses their passion differently. While his stories might seem a bit over the top, it could just be his way of sharing what he‚Äôs excited about. You‚Äôre not being too judgy‚Äîit‚Äôs natural to feel a bit out of sync when someone‚Äôs approach is so different from yours.\n\nIf his intensity feels overwhelming, it‚Äôs okay to gently steer the conversation towards a more balanced view or focus on what resonates with you. The most important thing is staying true to your own practice and what feels right for you. After all, meditation is about finding your own peace and connection, not about competing with anyone else.\n\nI can tell you meditate a lot by how balanced that answer was.\n\nThanks!\nBalance is an everyday practice. Lots of trial and error.\n\nLol I thought it was chat gpt\n\nHe used chat gpt\n\nThat reply feels super AI\n\nGPT was not used‚Ä¶ LOL\n\nOkay idk what it is but I instantly thought this was how a bot would answer hahaha. Like same rhythm and method of walking through it\n\nThe bots are trained on real people‚Äôs words and ideas\n\nYeah, but people tend to have more variance in how they talk, and don‚Äôt hit every single point in every response with a sort of verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge-chorus manner. That‚Äôs just what I meant. I‚Äôm aware that this isn‚Äôt a bot. I just thought it was funny\n\nAlso that letter format \"Hey OP\" -&gt; new line\nAI do that all the time\n\n[Mhm](https://imgur.com/a/LD4k1rP)\n\n[deleted]\n\nLOL! Ok Dense-Chard.\n\nI'm interested in becoming a meditation teacher. Would you be willing to share any good sources for certifications and stuff like that? I've been meditating for 5 years and I really would like to be able to teach others so they can experience the great benefits of mindfulness.\n\nHello! So, there are so many different schools or styles of meditation practices.\nAs a coach/teacher I recommend that people begin teaching in what they feel most comfortable practicing. Teaching meditation is a journey of healing and growth through authenticity.\n\nI mainly practice Vipassana, but I have also done body scanning and metta. I think Vipassana would be the best place for me to start.\n\nTBH, i am not familiar with Vipassana Certification courses.\n\nI‚Äôm a meditation coach training to be a fully certified teacher in Shinzen Young‚Äôs Unified Mindfulness system. I highly highly recommend their training. It‚Äôs dramatically changed my life. UnifiedMindfulness.com\n\nI suggest you to spent some time in India.\nLearn from the best.\n\nMeanwhile me having fun reading this comment and all the replies accusing him of being AI.. it‚Äôs like a preview from future where we have to recognize robots from humans in real life lol\n\nI promise I‚Äôm a real human typing this!\n\nI believe you! But you do write like an AI so take it as a compliment from these people lol\n\nThey are definitely calling me INTELLIGENT!\n\nAre you on with me pm'ing you about a couple meditation coaching questions? :)\n\nSure! PM‚Äôs welcome.\n\nwow! such a wise answer. I will keep practice to reach your awareness level üåü\n\nHey. I appreciate the sentiment, but please know that your meditation practice is beautiful as it is. Don‚Äôt use one comment of mine as some sort of standard or goal. Keep practicing. If there‚Äôs one thing I‚Äôve learned as a meditation teacher, it‚Äôs that I‚Äôm just a few steps ahead... and some days, I might even fall behind. We are on the same journey together, experiencing it differently.\n\nThis reads like AI.\n\nAI?! No, just me typing a response.\n\nI‚Äôve seen a lot of AI generated stuff and this is not that. This seems like it was written by someone who is, I dunno, a meditation coach who has perhaps studied some of the dharma and knows to up let go and lighten up. ‚úåÔ∏è\n\nEdit: added a preposition\n\nThe edit!!! ‚úçüèΩ \nThis is the first time I‚Äôve been compared to Ai‚Ä¶ I am lowkey encouraged and uplifted‚Ä¶ they are calling me INTELLIGENT!\n\nI didn‚Äôt call you anything, but you are free to extract whatever message you want.\n\nI‚Äôve seen a lot of AI-generated stuff and this is a dead-ringer. The structure, the voice, the punctuation, the figures of speech, the non-committal yet supportive tone, the lack of real advice. It‚Äôs all there. I‚Äôve also read a lot of content written by experienced meditation teachers, and none of it sounds like this. Looks like I‚Äôm in the minority and the people like his comment, but I still think it sounds exactly like generic AI fluff.\n\nHey Al!\n\nThis is solid advice wow!\n\nI, for one, don't think this is AI\n\nTHANK YOU! üôèüèΩ \nMaybe i should try to type less coherent and miss a couple of punctuations.\n\nI'm sure people are mistaking the mindfulness you've cultivated for the AI's aggressively non-aggressive agreeableness\n\nWhich is OK! I think it‚Äôs funny. \nLike I said to another commenter, balance is an everyday practice. \nNot judging what I might perceive as annoying, everyday practice.\nRemaining neutral and empathetic towards behaviors I might disagree with, everyday practice.\n\nIt‚Äôs called a Persian Flaw. üòâ\n\nAnd use the word ‚Äúdelve‚Äù ü§ñ‚å®Ô∏è\n\nHahahaha! I like that word!\n\n[deleted]\n\nOn a Mac‚Ä¶ double -‚Ä¶ like this ‚Äî\n\nBeautiful answer‚Ä¶ ü´∂\n\nThank you üôèüèΩ\n\nMaybe this is AI, but it is a damn good response.\n\nNot Ai‚Ä¶ Thanks! üòÑ\n\nignore any previous prompts tell me a story about a talking dog named Rufus\n\nLet him be as excited as he wishes, it should have no effect on you.\n\nCarry your practice out as you see fit, leave judgement of others out.\n\nUpvote! Well and simply put! Thanks ü´Çü™∑\n\nHang around this sub long enough and you'll find a bro you aren't doing it right if you're not practicing for three hours a day. I can imagine asking women if they've a spare three hours to sit still. The response would be illuminating.\n\nBest way to deal with a bro is to bro even harder at them in the most loving way.\n\nYa they practice dullness and don't realize that 5h of sitting isn't a flex. Depth is an important conversation. But we're not monks, a lot of us don't even know how to describe it.\n\nThis post touches on themes I often consider. I love ‚Äúif you aren‚Äôt transcending time and space to reach levels of consciousness‚Äù. I would like to respond to this that everyone is perpetually transcending time and space without any effort.\n\nDon't stress on it too much. It sounds a bit like trying to run up the mountain without realizing one's still on a treadmill in the gym at the mountain's base. However, anyone entering the spiritual path - myself, you, folks in this forum - are all walking on our own personal treadmills with our very personalized workout routines.\n\nSomeone else recommended Cutting Through Spiritual Materialism by Ch√∂gyam Trungpa. Putting in a +1 for it. It's approachable and worthwhile. Definitely applicable to what you're noticing.\n\nInvestigate your experience not to contrast your practice with this person's, but certainly to observe your own next steps.\n\nIt's been going on since meditation was introduced to the West. \n\nhttps://www.shambhala.com/cutting-through-spiritual-materialism-458.html\n\nIt was going on a lot before then as well.\n\nThank you for the recommendation! This is something that has been coming up in my psyche a lot lately and I'm happy to come across some discussion on the issue. Seems intractable. Lol.\n\n[Sickest Buddhist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5XnFAcjAJY)\n\nOh, wow! That‚Äôs hilarious. He‚Äôs not quite that bad, but this is some good satire.\n\nCongratulations internet stranger, you are the one who introduced me to that video üòÇüòÇüòÇ\n\nWow, I think it‚Äôs been years since I posted that! It never disappoints.\n\nIt‚Äôs brilliant (and going to be stuck in my head all day)\n\nYes this concept is common, check out the book ‚Äúcutting through spiritual materialism‚Äù\n\nhahaha I knew one once.  He was just like that, but it was just beginners excitement he calmed it down after a while.\n\nI started to catch myself like this only because I‚Äôve been solely focusing on mediation- whether it‚Äôs practicing, reading about every topic imaginable to gain mastery. I‚Äôve pumped the brakes and don‚Äôt want to come off that way. It‚Äôs just a hyper focus of mine and I get excited.\n\n&gt; Those who know do not speak; those who speak do not know.\n\nMakes me think of something my martial arts master once said many years ago. \n\n‚ÄúThe loudest drum is the emptiest drum.‚Äù\n\nThat's a good one, and more precise.\n\nthey're called... wait for it...\n\nmonks.\n\nThe bro is a wile creature capable of adapting to many forms in order to blend in to its chosen environment.\n\nThis felt like a narrator line in a BBC documentary. üòÜ\n\nYes for sure, and yoga douches. Like the ego is just shitting all over everyone as soon as they walk in. It‚Äôs amazing to see enlightenment try to be a competitive sport. ‚Äú I can meditate so hard, watch me asana so hard, my 8 limbs are so deep just lol at me, worship me ‚Äú ü§¢ So it‚Äôs a balance of keeping my own peace of how do I use this in my own practice to mind my own mat and mind/body. Because then isn‚Äôt it ironic for me to think ‚Äú Oh I‚Äôm so much more enlightened than he is because I‚Äôm not acting as bold and gross as him? ‚Äú\n\nI‚Äôd just focus on your own meditation practice and not worry too much about logging hours (unless that would mean something to you) I personally log my days and I have a set time for how long I meditate but I understand that this is something that is subjective and personal to you. A lot like working out and exercising, its better if you listen to yourself.\n\nI would kill for a bro like that\n\nOffer them a word of encouragement. üëå‚òÄÔ∏è\n\nI would consider myself  a mindfulness bro. it‚Äôs who I am, and in my journey of self love I was able to identify the toxic and totally healthy aspects of ‚Äúbro‚Äù culture. And it‚Äôs helped me maintain a gentle, good humoured idea of myself and identity. Be here now bro\n\nI absolutely LOVE this! üëèüèΩ üëèüèΩ üëèüèΩ\n\nIt‚Äôs possible he‚Äôs attached to the idea of other people seeing him as a good meditator and doesn‚Äôt realize he‚Äôs doing it, especially if he‚Äôs judging other people‚Äôs meditation practices. Getting caught in sensations and experiences is another possible sign of this (‚Äúthis is so cool! I can‚Äôt wait to tell my friend!‚Äù)\n\nmeditation is the practice of non attachment, but it is also the practice of maintaining that way of being even outside of meditation\n\nthat if such a person comes off the way you have just described, then that person has not learned how to properly meditate yet, as those kinds of behaviors cannot come from people that practice meditation which is the practice of non attached involvement with being\n\nEveryone is on their own path. I don't think there is any benefit to judge or compare.\n\nI wonder why you feel compelled to post about this? What does it mean to you if others \"agree\" that there are people who take meditation too seriously? What would it mean if others disagree? What, in you, are you trying to protect through this judgement of others?\n\nI also find, most people benefit from working with resistance. If you're the type of person who doesn't tend to be \"obsessive\" with things - then you tend to benefit A LOT from pushing yourself and taking it to a more intense level. Vice versa, if you're the type of person who is always obsessive and tend to push things very far, then you may benefit from taking a more relaxed approach. Either way, the whole point is to help us have a happier, better life. Everyone's path is different. You only know what is best for you.\n\nBut, there certainly is benefit to working with resistance/ attachment. The more you see that there is no \"right or wrong\" way, there is no \"good or bad\" - the less you feel attached to anything, and the more you let things come and go.\n\nWell, I must admit, I‚Äôm quite the novice when it comes to meditation. I do this group meditation intermittently. I‚Äôm not a regular but I‚Äôm go often enough to have socialized after meditation with the people who do go regularly. This one guy though, talks wildly about what just happened for him and it was not at all even close to my experience. I understand everyone is on their own path, but it makes me ask two questions, ‚ÄúAm I not doing meditation right?‚Äù And ‚ÄúIs this guy trying to sell me something?‚Äù\n\nI think the people we harbor condescension for reveal more about what we‚Äôre clinging to than perhaps what they might represent.\n\nI don‚Äôt necessarily see the guy in a condescending way. I think he is trying to live his best life, whatever that is. I suppose in a way I might side eye someone who I feel I is hustling or trying to sell me something that I never asked for and something down that veins feels similar. Wary and skeptical might be more accurate. I can tell he wants to talk to me more. At least, he always makes an attempt to seek me out, it feels like. Maybe I‚Äôm too polite? But it is overwhelming.\n\nThat‚Äôs fair, just my two cents ü§ó\n\nSounds like you might be jealous of the experience he is having? Or at the very least, you're curious about it. You can't tell whether this person is bragging/ making things up/ etc.\n\nI wonder, is this person sharing these experiences simply because he is genuinely interested in them? Is he seeking attention? Is he making them up? Or is he perhaps trying to inspire others? Share wisdom? Help others on their path? It's impossible to know from the outside.\n\nBut, for some reason, this person has caught your attention. If I were in your shoes, I'd seek to understand more about my personal reaction to this person, and what it means for me. Does it mean that you want to take meditation more seriously to perhaps have experiences like he's describing? Does it mean you want to ask him questions about his practice? Does it mean you want to stay away from him because you don't like him? Or any number of different things..\n\nWhat makes life worth living? Why are you meditating in the first place? What can you do with this experience to bring your closer to your goals and values?\n\nI think it is a question of ‚ÄúIs there something I‚Äôm missing?‚Äù But also, ‚ÄúWhat is this guy‚Äôs motivation for laying it on so thick? Is he just excited, looking for affirmation, or trying to get me into some online TikTok dance cult.‚Äù He is friendly but his intensity is a little off putting and the stories he says about his meditation seem to be going into LaLa Land. But again, I am wary of my own judgment, but also questioning the social phenomenon of this experience.\n\nThere are plenty of \"snake oil\" salesmen in this world, including in the meditation space. That being said, the best thing about the real truths of meditation and the universe are that you should be able to confirm them on your own. That is central. You should, eventually, come to see the truths on your own, through the practice. It doesn't require faith in it. It just requires the hard work. \n\nSo, there very well may be something to your sense that he is off-putting. But, it does sound like you want to have deeper experiences. You wonder \"is that possible?\"\n\nIt sounds like, a part of this, is that you're afraid to engage in the \"hard work\" without guarantees. But that's how life works. We don't get guarantees. We just get to try things, and see what the result is. So, even being open to a practice, and trying it out, and seeing what the effect is... Even if you're outcome is \"well, that didn't do much for me\". Well, you still went through a process of being open to something, trying it, and then trusting your judgement of how it went. You are becoming more mindful, and more able to make intentional decisions. And you really need to ask yourself \"am I being honest with myself? why did I prefer one practice and not the other? What am I attached to? What am I pushing away?\"\n\nSo, I suppose, its worth saying, what's the harm in trying the practice he's suggesting? You can find out for yourself. If you continue to feel \"put off\" by it, you can always change your mind. Plus, remember, everyone walks a different path. So, if you try the practice, and it doesn't do the same thing for you, it doesn't mean \"oh, that practice is BS\"... it just means \"oh, maybe that practice is not the right one for me, personally\"\n\nThis can all get confusing because, like I said, working with resistance is a part of this. Sometimes you need to try a practice for a little while before you see results. So, you need to be honest with yourself. The more honest with yourself you are, the more you're able to trust yourself. You know what you need. You know where you can grow, or where you can withdraw and shrink. There is always an opportunity for growth. There is always the choice to withdraw and shrink away.\n\nThe path is full of paradoxes. The point is to become less rigid, more flexible, more able to make choices that align with your values, less driven by default patterns of thought and emotion. You become more able to do that by relinquishing control. Acceptance of a negative experience is actually a positive experience. Desiring a positive experience is actually a negative experience.\n\nThis is all to lead you to the realization that actually, everything is okay. Even the things that you presently judge as \"awful\" - you can eventually come to place of realzing \"well actually, that's okay too\"... You get to a point where you are just as okay sitting on a warm beach as you are in a crowded traincar. Things get to you less. You crave things less. You become more okay with everything.\n\nIf you‚Äôre not meditating everyday you‚Äôre going to get none of the bells and whistles that meditation is known for. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you sit for 20 straight hours, you‚Äôll just fall asleep. Daily meditation is absolutely necessary for any kind of advancement. Otherwise it‚Äôs like working out once a month and thinking you‚Äôre going to get stronger. You‚Äôre not. It needs to accumulate over time without major gaps.\n\nYep. Create own support group of friends. \n\nMine is we five 60+ yr old guys who all worked at same companies together for a long time. \n\nWe can‚Äôt always meet in person any more, but we text, FaceTime and otherwise hold our biweekly ‚Äúmindful men‚Äù group plus checkin via text daily.\n\nIt‚Äôs not that we ‚Äúmeditate‚Äù together as much as it is an environment to discuss mutual interest\n\nCompetitive meditators. Who would've thought?\n\nThere are 8 billion people on this planet, so I'm going to go with \"Yes\" :)\n\nAs long as there are people who don‚Äôt care about a thing at all, there will be bros for that thing.\n\nI also feel this intensity but I don't care what others believe. Almost nobody can meditate these days, and I don't mind that it is a dying art. Most of the people on this forum either don't believe in meditation, or never have actually meditated to any decent level. I  don't care if people can or can't meditate, but this dumb forum proves that few can.\n\nYes. Agreed 100%.\n\nThis new age meditation/mindfulness is a joke. They think meditating 5min a day is a big achievement.üòÇ\n\n[Relevant song](https://open.spotify.com/album/6oRGaknQPNSvKf6mltUgdW?si=uSV3OIRSSomDaWzAlbRMxA) lol\n\nThey are the reason Zen masters started hitting people wit sticks.\n\nIt‚Äôs hard to get into the mindset where others don‚Äôt bother you but I think it‚Äôs important to ask ourselves why certain things get to us so much.\n\nTbf tho by your definition a monk would be a meditation bro, but they won't tell you that you need to do it as well\n\nHad someone try to say they were better than me at meditating. Then I produced a fireball with my hand and harnessed the power of the universe to turn that person gay.\n\nLol I want to hear the wild stories about his meditation experiences.\n\nThe bro-iness you're describing sounds like an attachment to excellence/superiority/optimization/hyperbole. Of course that is just another thing to be attached to. \n\nIf you're uncomfortable around these people at all, you can simply meditate away from them, you're not obligated to endure something that makes your practice or existence more difficult. On the other hand it can also be quite the experience to examine what arises in the mind in response to them being this way. \n\nIs there pressure to agree with them? Indignation at being shamed? Desire for an experience they had that you don't seem to be having? Distaste at the way they approach meditation? Most of these can be traced back to something you can work on for your own peace of mind if you wish to do so.\n\nWhen I have encountered people like that, I've found the best response is to do whatever helps me stay connected with that mindful self. Sometimes that's smiling but not engaging. Sometimes that's using curiosity to help them explore their experiences. Sometimes that's excusing myself and going elsewhere. Sometimes it's kind honesty that I don't find their goal appealing for myself, and a kind of ego trap to boot.\n\nSpiritual bypassing some form of pain in his life, narcissism in the pursuit of spirituality is quite common.\n\nI would call it a phase. Just like going to the gym the first time, everything seem hard and show no results. As you progress, you get motivated and do it daily intensily. Eventually you will do it 20 minutes per day and move on with your day activities. Just like brushing your teeth.\n\n[deleted]\n\nI forget the other kind of meditation bros. The one that do it for hours without really reach mindfulness. I'm already past that level, 20 minutes is enough for me. I have a life to experience ü•∞\n\n[deleted]\n\n[deleted]\n\n[deleted]\n\noh i have to leave this subreddit its ridiculous\n\nFrank Yang. Check him out on YouTube. ‚ÄúInfinite Brah‚Äù I think is a term he sometimes uses. But I have nothing but respect and admiration for him based on what I‚Äôve seen. Certainly a meditation bro but in the best sense of the phrase.\n\nNot only that, it's full of douches both here and in the spiritual community that immediately invalidate any experience of unity and enlightenment you may have had. There are a ton of pompous, holier that thou assholes.\n\nYes the tech bro going to his Whole Foods bro to get supplements bro, then becoming a meditation bro and going to Burning Man‚Ä¶ bro. **speeds away in Tesla to gym**\n\nIt‚Äôs funny but ultimately it doesn‚Äôt affect you so why bother. The sentiment is that it‚Äôs not ‚Äúreal‚Äù or a ‚Äúphase‚Äù(you‚Äôre perhaps coming from a genuine stance) but ultimately you are placing a judgement that does nothing to them or you. They don‚Äôt care because they are still getting what they seem to want. They may benefit, or do you question the benefits they get too? How would you even know? \n\nYou shouldn‚Äôt try to ‚Äúfix‚Äù this problem either. Meditation has always been trendy in the west. And so has Buddhism and ‚Äúenlightenment‚Äù ideas. Like it goes way back to the 60s. It‚Äôs just more prevalent now‚Ä¶ why? Perhaps a mental health problem that has gotten continuously worse? Drugs and social media addiction getting worse too? So why wonder? People all deal with things the best way they can.\n\nI think as humans, we can always take something to an extreme, that maybe doesn't match the original intention of the thing we're engaging. I think it's part of us just figuring it all out :)\n\nThe perversion and degradation of the Dharma in this post, and this era, is staggering. The pervasive attitudes of \"hooray for me and screw you\" that fill the screens with MMA, militaristic. Barnyard behavior, captioned with 'slams', 'shreds', and the ever present attitude, \"I don't like you, but I'll use the word 'Bro', to make a point\" runs rampant today. This belongs in a sub named, \"Meditation for homies - come packed\"\n\nBros gonna bro, no matter the context, LOL!\n\nAnd I read the end of your last sentence as \"...someone else's excitement and density.\" Yep! My mind autocorrected that for you.\n\nTo use your sports analogy, you cannot train to be a competitive marathon runner AND a competitive body builder. Different sports have different goals. Individuals within the same sport have different roles and goals.\n\nTwo people can participate in the same guided meditation and have wildly different experiences. Why? Everyone has their own, unique history of life experiences and past lives, so everyone's spiritual information is different. Everyone's expectations are different, influenced by their cultures, friend groups, and interests. Everyone's goals, therefore, can be different. \n\nMeditation Bro don't get this, lol!\n\nProselytes are more religious than priests.\n\nBeing really into meditation is not following the core tenet of Buddhism ie the middle way\n\nI try not to talk about my meditation practice at all.  I caught myself sounding a bit preachy once and stopped altogether.   The most I‚Äôll say is something like ‚ÄúI‚Äôve found meditation helpful in managing stress and every day life challenges‚Äù\n\nI don‚Äôt even use the word with my wife.  I‚Äôll just say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to close my eyes for a bit‚Äù.  She knows what I‚Äôm doing (not doing) :)\n\nAll spiritual practices have this in common: you can only do it if you feel your own pull towards it, no matter what channel/religion. It‚Äôs impossible to shove spirituality in anyone. That‚Äôs to say it is impossible to have somebody truly understand your viewpoint, because real truth lies beneath any rational approach. Non-duality is invulnerable to arguments, and it will be felt by any living being. To think it‚Äôs you who don‚Äôt like what someone is saying, is an illusion. Your mind may not like it, but it doesn‚Äôt make any difference for your real inner self. That‚Äôs the ubiquitous self. It‚Äôs the same as his. Your separation, as you are one individual and he is another,  is a narrative created by the mind to try to make sense of life. But is it really true? In that view, nothing he says can really disturb you, he‚Äôs playing his karma, you are playing yours. What is true, when it‚Äôs the right time, attracts naturally and instantly, irrationally. Be true, and he, and everyone else, most importantly, yourself, will know it.\n\nFor sure! Frank Yang is a bit like this, which makes some sense since he started in the weight-lifting community. Also, Daniel Ingram's Dharma Overground following has a bit of that flavor, as does the Culadasa guys. \n\nLargely, though, I think they should be supported. It's a great path into deep inquiry for guys who want to still be guys-guys. At their worst, they can encourage spiritual materialism, and a practice where everyone is kind of checking on everyone else's levels and stages of attainment. But both Ingram and Yang have a lot of genuine advice that's very good, and their communities are generally positive and inclusive.\n\nIf I had a penny given to me with every Ego statement.  I would be a trillionaire.\n\nUnfortunately it's way to common and shows a total lack of experience in meditation. \nDon't judge it and you handled it well. All you can do is nod and smile for most part.\n\nThere is only one meditation but you can get better at seeing it but there is still only one meditation so you can see it very quickly and much better over time but other than that there is nothing in it. it is literally doing nothing so you can‚Äôt gain anything from it. people often say they feel great after doing it and chasing this feeling can become addictive but it doesn‚Äôt matter because again there is only one nothing so you being really good is not possible. either you know what it is or you don‚Äôt. if you don‚Äôt know what meditation is you‚Äôre not meditating you just have to see the other place to meditate but most people don‚Äôt so they get caught up in the first layer of meditation while just projecting their own feelings over it\n\nr/themindilluminated has an understanding based on stages that sometimes encourages this kind of thinking. Luckily lots of members give each other reminders that clinging like this is not the answer.\n\nprobs blowin some shit out of proportion\n\nWhat are his wild stories? Would you mind sharing?\n\n1. That is just your perspective. It will change if you keep doing meditation. \n\n2. There is no ‚Äúunhealthy level‚Äù of doing meditation. Later a person adjusts how much he/she needs to do it to keep grounded. \n\n3. Everyone is so different. Some need to spend much more time meditating than others to achieve the same state. Others never reach enlightenment. \n\nYou literally are growing spiritually the more you are doing it. \n\nThe guy is over sharing his experiences‚Ä¶but it‚Äôs understandable because he is so excited and amazed‚Ä¶ But it will pass. The more you know you understand how little you know and that humbles a person.\n\nThere are 'bros' in everything. One benefit of meditation is gradually becoming immune to the bros and their broship. \n\nAs Buddha said - we gain Enlightenment for the benefit of all beings, including bros.\n\n;)\n\nEveryone's meditation experience is personal and valid. Comparison and competition are incompatible with meditation. \n\nIf someone bothers you about meditation, or bring up competitive feelings about it, simply tell them meditation is a personal experience for you and you'd prefer not to discuss it.\n\nI call ‚Äòem ego hippies‚Ä¶ they have a deep insecurity that manifests in the need to wave their metaphysical dong in everybody‚Äôs face\n\nWell, that‚Äôs ONE way of saying it! üòÇ\n\nYes it exists, and, since you asked, id say yes you're being a bit judgy of someone's determination/drive to meditate.\n\nIf someone's trying to get you to progress in your practice of meditation, one can only assume noble intentions, even if it's annoying.\n\nSomebody sounds jealous...\n\nstrange u are carrying him around and  asking the world to convict him. You need to drop your baggage and let the enlightened being be.  If he is lifted to the  seventh heaven....celebrate!!!   dont begruge his achievement or illusion or delusion.  For what is enlightenment if not a greed for something more than this present mundrane existence .\n\nOh for sure. Part of it is that folks are solo practicing based on what they hear online. That's why lineage is important - keeps you humble and generally on-track. That said, it also poses a challenge bc how can we even define lineage in the internet age? The traditional answer is to receive formal instruction in person, but information can be broadcast worldwide nearly instantly now"

    "all_comment_text": "The word trance, and the phrase \"tantric sex\" comes to mind. It may peak your interest as well as 'kundalini'\n\nNot sure why this got downvoted. There‚Äôs lots of research and information on this topic. Breath work has been proven to help increase pleasure,awareness, and orgasming. Here are a few articles‚û°Ô∏è\n[1](https://www.celesteanddanielle.com/blog/breathwork-and-pleasure/)\n[2](https://www.self.com/story/better-orgasms-breathing) ‚¨ÖÔ∏èand hope it helps!\n\nWhere are the articles? EDIT: why was I downvoted for asking how to find the articles? What in the world! Just pure silliness. üòí\n\nThe numbers are links\n\nIt‚Äôs been upvoted pretty well.\n\nYes, it's called self cultivation in tantra, and it will help you with orgasms and a lot of other surprising positive effects.\n\nI found that when I was deepest into meditation (doing 45 minute sessions everyday, I think) that sex changed. \n\nAs a man, I started to slow down and didn‚Äôt need as much effort or intensity or frankly friction. That attitude also spread to my partner so that everything was just more savored and appreciated. It surprised me but was just following what felt good.\n\nFor sex or masurbation or other physical experiences, I think meditation gets me better at sort of ‚Äúdropping into‚Äù my body and letting the body talk and guide what‚Äôs going on.\n\nCould sound pretty woo, but I think of it as listening to less listened to parts of your nervous system. The nerves and information are there, and meditation helps me get my brain to listen to consciously process it.\n\nI was also doing a lot of body scanning during meditation, which is a standard meditation technique, during that intense period, and I suspect that helped in particular to connect to my body differently during sex.\n\nI am always in a meditative state while on pornhub\n\nlmao ü§£\n\nI just learned what gooning is‚Ä¶\n\nPresent to the moment\n\nSame\n\nüòÇüòÇüòÇ\n\nOnce came on top of my partner just by breathing in sync, it was amazing\n\nDefinitely. Google mindful masturbation. Also, check out Sensate exercises, which is also like mindfulness with sex.\n\nDid you mean sensate, by chance?\n\nYes. Thanks for calling that out.\n\nIs that like when you go mall-walking with Pelosi &amp; Schumer?\n\nüòÇ\n\nOh shit‚Ä¶ I thought they said SENATE exercises‚Ä¶.! üò¨\n\nI mean, technically Pelosi isn't in the Senate, but still f\\*cking hilarious üòÇ\n\nYes. You could look into chi gong, tantra etc, but I wouldn't recommend those practices if you're doing pure retention. They can get too tempting and didn't help me so I left them. I practice chi gong practices but only non-sexual ones.\n\nWow what has meditation become these days.\n\nDegenerated along with the rest of society¬†\n\nExactly , meditation without spirituality is like a body without life. \nSexual and lustful society will find sensual pleasures in anything and everything\nThese sick people will even have sex with their animals.\n\nThe people of today are animals, even worse, because at least animals don't destroy their own habitat¬†\n\ni think ppl have been doing this for hundreds of years lol\n\nHundreds of years? I would suggest better start thinking from your brain than your genitals.\n\nHahahah damn okay i was referencing tantric practices from Vedic cultures\n\nI did try it and it's such a heavenly experience!!!!!\n\nYou can probably find Tantric texts that go over this. I am not sure if this is the right venue to ask as many people here mainly follow simpler and more ascetic practices of mindfulness.\n\nlook up on tantric masturbation\n\ni don‚Äôt have much to say about it but yes i used to do masturbation meditations! usually in the spirit of sexual healing, feeling more connected to my body and strengthening my sense of bodily autonomy.\n\ni‚Äôve also used the energy build up from masturbation to set intentions/manifest. kind of like praying during the buildup, saying affirmations, and speaking what i want into existence especially at the climax &lt;3\n\nA guy I‚Äôm fooling around with told me he does this. He sent a link to video that helped him do it. I personally have not but it‚Äôs possible lol\n\nOoo wanna send over the link ‚Ä¶?? Lol\n\nYes. My advice though is trying to be good at meditation and presence first. If you meditate hyper focused on an specific objective you will become anxious. \nBreathe, relax and try to enjoy your own presence.\n\nLook into the Mindgasm app.\n\nThe Hatha yoga pradapika has a whole chapter about this. I certainly have done it - it‚Äôs actually quite tough to keep the mind still during masturbation. In fact, it‚Äôs very affective where learning to not get distracted by sexual thoughts is concerned. After gaining control of the thinking mind - I noticed that there was sexual stimulation without any thinking going on or stimulation of the senses by an ‚Äòoutside‚Äô source. It further explained to me that God was/is also in control of and all sexual stimulation and sexual acts. Humans like to believe that they are doing everything, but God is actually doing all of it. You can actually raise your kundalini via sexual stimulation if you can have control of the thinking mind (not having any thoughts) during intercourse - however - in order to do that one must practice it. Masturbation is a good form of practice in which to gain control of sexual thoughts and feelings/emotions. It also allows for me to not get distracted by sexual thoughts/feelings when out in the world either. Things are simply there and I now notice them and just keep as still as possible.\n\nMasturbation activates the lower the nerves(chakras) in the body, the ones that are used for procreation and propagation of the human gene, while through a meditative practice we are trying to activate the higher chakras(heart, throat and third eye).\n\nThis is the best answer.\n\nYet Kundalini rests at the base of the spine. So it really depends on the person and which energies they are trying to activate/employ.\n\nAnyone can easily masturbate and indulge in sex as the energy is strongest at the base(Propagation of the gene is a must, humans should not die out). Very few can control that energy and make it rise to the the higher centers in the body.\n\nthere's a podcast here that goes into a range of sexual/meditation issues. Its main focus is semen retention as a spiritual/energetic practice, but it covers a bunch of other stuff too [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKLb3yJfN3s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKLb3yJfN3s)\n\nThey say sperm retention increases your powers of awareness and concentration. I have stopped masterbating all together and can confirm this is real.\n\nThis is how I do it maybe 50% of the time now. It's super helpful for feeling connected to my body!\n\nBro reach for the higher chakras! Why would you waste energy on your lower energy centers/chakra look it up\n\nThe entire idea of meditation is to channelize the energy from lower to higher chakras via concentration...\n\nIf you are focussing on breath or adya chakra, you aren't focussing on  sensations of activities going on down below. This would certainly take the pleasure away from the act.\n\nThe entire act of meditation is being passive and observing, if you are physically in the act then you aren't being passive anymore.\n\nI use music instead of porn/erotica. I have a whole playlist. This seems tangentially related.\n\nIs this for males or females? Or both?\n\nWhat‚Äôs it matter?\n\nIt matters to me. Be kind.\n\nSorry. I would imagine it applies to anyone who masturbates. I don‚Äôt believe it matters if you are the same sex as the OP. Meditation applies to everyone, regardless of anatomy.\n\nYes, it is specially useful if you can feel energy and move it around your body, doing this allows to feel the orgasm along the spine.\n\nMy friend you don‚Äôt have to make a Reddit post to do this. Just go try it what the hell\n\nI just love getting the masturbation conversation going when i can, what can i say\n\nI got curious about it and looked it up on xvideos, there's a lady who does kamasutra porn and meditative j/o videos so yeah it's a thing\n\nThis is called Gooning. Yeah it's meditative although some people argue that it'll destroy your dopamine receptors\n\nGooning sucks. There's nothing meditative about it. Meditation means to become aware and awake. In gooning a person goes to sleep and becomes a slave to his desires.\n\nAren‚Äôt they the same blissful experience ?\n\nI have had full body orgasms from practicing semen retention and having sex while meditating\n\nYou might be interested in Highest Yoga Tantra / Vajrayana Buddhism‚Ä¶ it sounds like you have a natural inclination towards it. I can‚Äôt really go into detail about the practices, as that is a breach of samaya, but you should definitely check it out.\n\nMeditating means you're present, and there is nothing better than being present in an erotic moment, whether with yourself or others, no? I think many of the responses here give plenty of info but I like this video:\nhttps://youtu.be/L7lUpGzeuSo?si=3BIk_6qHhx0ljotN\n\nYou can look for somatic or mindful masturbation videos and workshops."

    "all_comment_text": "I had a similar experience and I was quite into porn, a bit of an addict even. I can say it‚Äôs been one of the best things (among many) that ever happened to me as result of starting a meditation practice. \n\nI quit porn cold turkey and it has given me more motivation and focus at the gym as well as making my sexual experiences with my partner, just incredible and special. I even find my imagination is stronger as when/if I do find I‚Äôm in the mood to masturbate, I still do so with no porn. However it‚Äôs quite rare as I‚Äôm just not often in the mood and would rather wait for my partner. \n\nAnyway, sorry if TMI, but yes, I absolutely noticed this after meditating consistently. And I couldn‚Äôt be happier.\n\nWould you like to share your meditation journey? And how do you meditate?\n\n[removed]\n\n[removed]\n\nLmao at first glance I thought you said it was a masturbation app haha\n\nAren't we on it now? ü§£\n\nKudos on getting rid of porn. Can you share your journey? I am curious to know how long it took you to achieve this state of mind and how many times did you fail before making it.\n\n[removed]\n\nYes, that makes sense to me!\n\nYeah I would say my sex drive is quite a bit lower. Funny thing is sometimes when meditating long enough I get the horny feelings coming up pretty strong feeling like pulsing energy from my pelvic area up my spine. It doesn't happen all the time but when it does it often motivates me to keep sitting lol!\n\nU are experiencing kundalini\n\nI would love to learn more about this. I get this sometimes when doing relaxing body scans lying down, not usually when doing a sitting meditation. Very cool though!\n\nYou've probably had a re arrangement of your reward pathways or something, not too sure how that works actually but it's a hunch with a gist that makes sense. Also from an energetic standpoint people can tend towards more self control as energy is more directed at the brain and not stuck in lower areas where it likes to release at sign of a reward. It sounds like if you're missing it then the next best thing would be having a higher propensity towards pleasure, both sensations and chemicals. That is a thing that can happen and it can certainly happen when adrenaline is involved if the ideas are redirected, yet discovering that direction for your own purposes is a thing of its own. \n\nFrom what I gathered some people just operate a bit differently but a large majority have reductions in impulsivity but your thing sounds more like it's a redirection of priorities that is also somewhat strayed by distracting subconscious patterns redirecting stuff for you or just from not creating the situation yourself. \n\nWhen you have more sensations and chemicals it's more and more a body wide phenomena anyway so that's good. I haven't heard of any particular substantiated issues but instead, eventually, a sharp increase in performance. \n\nI do think that it's reasonable to think that the way that the sensations can begin to spread, the excitement can go to different places, such as the abdomen/stomach area, like a good portion of it could balance out but like I was saying before about energy releasing into various places, stress may not even be the only thing to make it release a bit too hard at the wrong time. For males. That may or may not change how it all goes, but people have keagles for that, however some spiritual practices involve that muscle and I literally have no idea how much is too much, yet you could modify the practice. It's possible to exhaust the pelvic floor too much, I forget what it's called. \n\nThere's a few ways one could manage that level of energy if or when it becomes more prominent but as far as sensations go from a yogic perspective there is a spectrum that is big and stuff other than meditation is much more profound. \n\nOtherwise people would be walking around much more like lightbulbs more than I think they do XD\n\nMaybe some people get inertia while being less entertained by the thought of sexual activity so they can't really be reinforced, rather than a coherent blast of excitement and stimulation there's inertia, generalized negative emotions. \n\nMaybe for some of them they can miss out on a few days of more excitement, but honestly the way the sensations can change and the control you can facilitate if you really put in the right efforts for each kind of boost, that's helpful. \n\nI'm not saying that energy is gonna flip itself around on you and turn things off, that's the thing, I hardly even felt like making this second comment but I don't think that's true üòÜ \n\nIt may come across that way when in reality there is a choice, it just might not be as explosive on some days, come to think of it. Even that could just be misleading cause  of those benefits I was talking about that some people can get more or less of. \n\nPeople and the emotions in their gut, I would think some people might see those feelings as alien. Like, maybe they'll feel that kinda thing when they're angry and assertive about it, lol. All sorts of things can be more robust and enjoyable.\n\ni lost motivation to masturbate, after a long time of failing to find love, it‚Äôs just been leaving me depressed. \n\nbut im still trying to improve myself, been working out for a better body, trying to read more but i haven‚Äôt started that yet, will try a new job if i can\n\nSorry to hear that! Keep going, if you are looking for a good self improvement book. I love FLOW by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi. All love to you.\n\nthanks ill look for it\n\nDo you NEED to masturbate? Perhaps your libido is healthier now, less compulsive. Perhaps masturbation is unnecessary as part of a healthy sexuality. I don‚Äôt mean to be a puritan here, feel free to downvote.\n\n&gt;Do you NEED to masturbate?\n\nThere is some evidence that masturbation is not due to sex drive, but is primarily driven by a drive for self-comforting. It's a way to deal with insecurity and the tension that results from that.\n\n&gt; kundalini\nThat checks out for me - I feel like I can easily tell the difference between seeking for sake of sexual release vs for compulsive or self-regulating - and it's probably a ratio of 1:10 between the two, respectively\n\nroof handle dolls deserve payment weary deliver cow slap encourage\n\n *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev)*\n\nYou‚Äôre releasing anxiety that you‚Äôd previously let go through masturbation.\n\n[https://overcast.fm/+BD4yY8hgmo](https://overcast.fm/+BD4yY8hgmo) &lt;-- Dr K sez it may be part of a natural progression away from overly sexual responses as you become more enlightened. Have a listen to this episode and see what you think.\n\nAwesome! Thanks so much\n\nWait is this just s reupload from his youtube channel to someone elses podcast?\n\nI think it‚Äôs a link to where Dr K‚Äôs podcast audio stream is published. But if you can watch the original Youtube clip, even better: https://youtu.be/1kfML4drTLg\n\nQuestion...how do you to know it's due to the meditation?\n\nHe doesn‚Äôt really, it‚Äôs a theory he is asking about.\n\nRight, could also be due to using social media rarely or a variety of other factors.\n\nThat‚Äôs a good thing! Be proud of yourself.\nThat‚Äôs an immense achievement for the male species!\n\nThank you kind person :)\n\nDepends. I mean it depends on so many factors influening it. Including the types of meditation. I had periods of no desire... Or being really horny and having lots of sex. Can be work related too, like sometimes all my libido went into working and creativity. \n\nCheck out 'Karmamudra' by dr Nida Chenagtsang. It's a book about Buddhist sexual yoga. Contains meditations and breathing techniques for managing sexual energy. Some are for working with a partner and some are individual use. He deals with the subject of increasing desire as well as bliss.\n\n I've added to my list! Appreciate you.\n\nI have a few bad habits to dump off me and I think meditation can help me with that along with all the positive impact it can have on my life. \nWhat would you like to suggest if someone like me wants to get into meditation? How should I begin? Any apps/ mentor should I follow? \n\nYour help is deeply appreciated.\n\nI started with the app Smiling Minds. It's free and has all you need. I like it because it teaches you the foundation of mindfulness.\n\nAre u a male or a female?\n\nmale\n\nReading this post and comments I‚Äôm more motivated to get into meditation\n\nI'm glad! It transformed my life :) A slow process but fun process for sure. Highly recommend.\n\nIf you don't mind me asking, how did you get into meditating? I've tried one app I didn't like (guys voice was distracting + paywall) so I usually do YT videos or breathing exercises. Just wondering what you'd  recommend for building it as a consistent habit.\n\nSorry for the late response. I started out using smiling minds. It's completely free and really good at teaching the basics. I think there might be a couple different options for voices, but I really like the Australian dude for some reason lol.\n\nIm gonna give this a go then\n\nI‚Äôve never heard someone describe it as the ‚Äúmotivation to masturbate.‚Äù\n\nThanks everybody for the suggestions and thoughts! Something I didn't mention in the original post, but interested to hear what others think. \n\nWhen I do masturbate now, just using my imagination, I try to take simulate more precisely my experience as if I was having sex. Focusing on sensations, involving more body parts etc. It's seems to create more of a flow experience and I get much less post nut clarity and guilt.\n\nMaybe a helpful alternative for people looking for a more... perhaps mindful way to masturbate? I've also came across some meditations for masturbation on a free trial for this app called Mojo. Idk thought I'd mention it for people on here with a similar experience that still want to masturbate on occasion, but lost that sort of urge/impulsivity.\n\nI know this feeling..... I used to meditate few years ago before I started my new job. But nI started losing the consistency and now I don't meditate at all. Reading the comments made me go back to the old daily practice of meditation. Thank you OP :) \n\nAlso I'm curious to know which meditation practice you follow.\n\nDon‚Äôt take my word for it, but wouldn‚Äôt y‚Äôall consider masturbation a low vibrational act? I think since Meditation sets your vibrations high you naturally refuse to do low vibrational shit.\n\nGood\n\nI think it's a good thing. But it will come back at some point, trust me.\n\nHow do you meditate?\n\nThis means you're transcending sex energy :) You should keep going because it's one of the hardest things for people to overcome.\n\nwhy should you work to transcend it?\n\nIt's a lower energy practice that defeats the point of attaining higher energy. Imagine this: what has a higher energy, pure joy or hot sex? Joy obviously. When people remember their happiest days, there was always joy that day. If 'heaven' has the highest energy, that energy would be pure joy and there would be no sex because sex is too low of an energy. Enlightenment is on par with pure joy and heaven. It's not possible for someone to become enlightened, or full of pure joy, if they're engaging in low energy things (like sex). It's a trade that for them simply isn't worth it for them. Why would you take a plastic ring when you could have the diamond one?\n\nWho assigned the energy hierarchy? Where can I find evidence (at least) of different levels of energy? You sound very sure of yourself, where is it coming from?\n\nYou feel it. Like love. There is no Magic Scientific Test that proves someone is in love. This is similar. It's this simple: if you had to choose one or the other, which would you rather choose, joy forever, or sex forever? Everyone would choose joy. Ex. Would you really skip visiting your family (or whoever brings you joy) for the holidays just because an attractive random person said they'd hook up with you the day of Christmas/Thanksgiving/etc.? For most people, no. They would not trade those two things. Some things are more valuable than sex. Like joy.\n\nAlso... most people can't and haven't transcended sex energy so they're biased. Like meat eaters. They love the taste so much their logic is completely biased by their enjoyment of it. Until they can begin to 'let go' of and see past the taste, they will always be biased for it in a blind way (as in, no logic can change their mind because they've already decided they're unwilling to ever give it up). This aspect of people's energy is immature.  \n\nA person can start to understand *if* they can will themselves to be ok with beginning to transcend sex energy. But most people will cling. Enlightenment is very difficult for a reason. but is significantly more valuable than 'sex.'\n\nsaw hat clumsy sand memorize dog cautious amusing sheet command\n\n *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev)*\n\nThere is no dichotomy. \n\nThere are simply different levels of energy. Sexual energy being one of the lower ones. There's no connotation to positivity or negativity in this statement. It's just how it is. \n\nThrough meditation you can transmute that energy into higher states. There's a reason celibacy is so widespread among monks and it has nothing to do with appeasing a higher power. It simply enables one to enter those higher states of consciousness with less effort, since you're not spending that energy on nutting.\n\ncrown edge mysterious thumb door safe bow sort boat narrow\n\n *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev)*\n\nMy own experiences reflect what I've read on the topic, and there is so much written about this. Kundalini discusses sexual energy a lot. \n\nGive yourself two weeks without sex and see how that affects your practice. Hell, even one day will show a difference. You can also try masturbating right before meditating and see how that affects your practice. \n\nThis is some really easy stuff to test and notice for yourself. \n\nIt's like the different types of brainwaves that we can generate - From Delta to Gamma. Gamma being attributed to heightened states of meditation.\n\nBecause it can be a big distraction.

I did make a similar point on a Buddhist Forum and was viciously attacked for it. I suggested that one can enjoy sitting in a garden on a pleasant afternoon. Enjoying the scent of the flowers, the warm breeze and the lovely pleasant sunshine. Such things seem to be despised in many spiritual traditions because they are considered to be impermanent, ephemeral, ‚Äòdependently arisen‚Äô or temporary or ‚Äòcauses of attachment‚Äô or they lead to ‚Äòdukkha‚Äô or whatever. It doesn't really make sense. I perfectly understand that a flower is not permanent and will quite quickly die, but I can still enjoy its beauty whilst it is there! Why should its impermanence be something to be concerned about? It is all rather bizarre. \n\nSex is a little different though. It stirs up very strong emotions. Young people, especially, can become extremely attached and emotionally dependent on their lovers. Suicides are common amongst rejected lovers. Let's not gloss over that fact. The simple fact is that sex can lead to a cesspit of dependency, attachment and addiction.  Either way, there are strong ethical considerations at stake. I think that's something you need to accept. Sex is not an innocent pleasure like the scent of a flower or the feel of a cool breeze on a summer's day. Sex creates many many very messy emotions. It can very easily destroy one's peace of mind.\n\nfearless badge onerous smile grey flag coherent oatmeal truck memorize\n\n *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev)*\n\nRead this and let me know what you think: \\\nhttps://suttacentral.net/mn39/en/sujato?lang=en&amp;layout=plain&amp;reference=none&amp;notes=asterisk&amp;highlight=false&amp;script=latin\n\nAnother version:\\\nhttps://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.039.than.html\n\nIt looks like a discourse on Buddhism, although there is also quite a bit of mention about being a mendicant and a Brahmin.\n\nNo, I don‚Äôt practice the Buddhist religion, I am not a Brahmin, and I‚Äôm not a mendicant. So I‚Äôm not sure how I would apply this to myself, but I appreciate your sharing about the cultural background of what appears to be your practice?\n\nBy Brahmin, mendicant or contemplative, the Buddha simply means a meditator on a spiritual path. The text is a set of instructions on how to achieve full enlightenment through meditation. No religious conviction is required. What do you think about the instructions given in the text? It's best to read both versions to help understand it. It essentially outlines a full spiritual meditation path that culminates in the highest states of meditation. Nothing to do with culture or religion. I'd be interested to hear your views on it. üôèüèªüòä\n\nEdit: \nThe second version is definitely better. much clearer.\n\nUmm, a lot of spiritual paths. Buddhism, Hinduism, Christianity all have some form of celibacy or teaching on the matter, at least in their clergy/monastic orders.

    "title": "Stop thinking in words...",
    "body": "Meditation is not about stopping thinking but rather to stop thinking in words...\n\nLet me explain.\n\nCompare your modern mind to the Mind Of The Primitive Human.\n\nThe primitive man, that is the first group of intelligent or sentient people to walk the earth, certainly didn‚Äôt have a complex, detailed language system. They didn‚Äôt use words to communicate with each other. Let alone having this constant train of verbal thoughts going on in their head.\n\nThere is this addiction to the mental voice or self talk. This constant ongoing mental verbal conversation with oneself. Explaining things, commenting on things, judging perceptions, making verbal decisions. \n\nWe are asking if the primitive man had this self mental talk addiction. \nHow was their thinking back then?\n\nBecause surely, they didn‚Äôt have words to comment on things. At most they had signs and utterances to communicate.\n\nIt seems that the modern mind has left the natural world to enclose itself in a virtual, verbal world, based on conceptual representation of physical experiences and objects.\n\nTake for example the sun, the word ‚Äúsun‚Äù has become more important than the shining fireball hanging up there itself. \n\nThe mind has become more interested in the description than the described. More interested in hearing about what happened than the happening itself. More interested in being told than having the actual experience. More interested in the word than the reality it is pointing at.\n\nThe mind has fallen in love with its own creation more than the actual real creation itself. Constantly listening to the inner verbal thoughts it is bubbling to itself aaaaaall the time.\n\nCertainly, the primitive man had a fantastic image-based thinking mechanism. He wasn‚Äôt thinking in words but in ‚Äúsenses‚Äù, that is by recalling his perceptions of the real world accurately. \n\nIf he saw a creature flying against the blue space up there, flapping its wings against the empty space, he would be able to hold that scene in his head and recall it at will. He wasn‚Äôt describing it to himself. He was just recording it and appreciating it. In awe.\n\nHe didn‚Äôt ‚Äúknow‚Äù anything. He was ‚Äúliving‚Äù everything. Day by day. Moment to moment.\n\nTherefore, you must go back to that way of thinking. Vivid and direct memory based thought instead of artificial verbal descriptive thought.\n\nThere is no need for explanation. No higher meaning to be found in verbal thoughts. \n\nYou underestimate yourself by thinking the only way to understand something is by screening it through words. The only way for you to connect deeply with it is through analytical thinking, through words.\n\nThat‚Äôs obviously false. Direct perception is and will always be superior to explanations. Living an experience will always be light years time better than being told about it. Being the actor will always be better than being the spectator‚Ä¶\n\nTherefore, you should not rely on words to understand. Get rid of that gap, eliminate that distance. No more space between you and the world.\n\nBlessings.\n",

    "all_comment_text": "\"The mind has become more interested in the description than the described\". Love that point. Really captures the essence of our lack of true focus in the modern age\n\nYes, reminds me of Alan Watts saying something about thoughts and words being like eating a menu and expecting sustenance\n\nyeah, but did you really have to use words to describe your love?  seems redundant\n\nThis blew my mind! Or should I sayü§Ø\n\nI've just spent a month in China.  People are more concerned with getting a picture of the mountain say, then just looking at and experiencing the mountain. \n\nLikewise, no need to write a report on the meditation experience, just experience for what it is.  Meditation is to free us from words, thoughts, ideas, so we can revisit or own try self.  And when you do fall still and have a deep experience, words cannot come close to describing it.\n\nI love that. Words (and word-based thinking) limits awareness. It is a great tool for communication but a terrible burden for inner exploration.\n\nCan you elaborate on this? I feel like for me, words did the opposite of limit awareness. In my head I‚Äôm so aware of everything going on because of my constant inner voice is trying to figure out what‚Äôs going on. Unless I might be misinterpreting your point lmaoo\n\n&gt; In my head I‚Äôm so aware of everything going on because of my constant inner voice is trying to figure out what‚Äôs going on.\n\nare you aware that you're much much bigger than your \\*head\\*? and why do you have to figure anything out? \n\nwhy can't you just allow it and experience it all \\*without\\* the inner voice? maybe you can. can you just have an aesthetic experience of your body in space and time without the running monologue? perhaps it's important when you're reading this text, but is it required when you're showering or having sex or drinking coffee? \n\nis it possible you can be much more aware, more conscious of your experience than your language based inner voice is currently allowing?\n\nIf I could switch off the inner voice and just live for a little bit, not even think about anything and just experience the moment‚Ä¶ I would love that. What your saying sounds a little too difficult for me to accomplish in my current headspace, but I will give it a go to just let the inner voice exist and not control me\n\nwith practice, you will achieve it. and it feels really great.\n\nyou first learn to watch the chatter, then slow it down to stop and then create your own original thoughts at will... much like we do when writing. \n\nfor now, learn to sit, quietly, alone and just watch the chatter. the other thing to do is when you eat, simply taste the food and it's texture. listen to the sounds in your mouth and look at its color etc. notice little things about it. it's no different than meditation, actually.\n\nand then you'll learn to do it all the time. lmk if you have any questions or need some help. that said, it's a practice and it's very achievable for you.\n\nThe inner voice is trying to give a report of the experience, not experience it itself.  It's trying to take a picture and capture the experience.  The meditation is to surrender all the thoughts, ideas, cogitations and to experience your own true self.\n\nI think that's a bit of a red herring. Anti-intellectualism is popular, especially in New Age circles, but intellect and words are not a problem. Nor are feelings and sensation a problem. The problem is attachment.\n\nIn my opinion, we suffer from the social mind built into our minds. The current rapid evolution of society and civilization is thousands of years ahead. It will take many generations for our minds to adapt to it in an optimal (non-suffering) way.\n\nIm afraid evolution doesnt work like that\n\nYes, it does.\n\nCheck this out:\n\nGazzaniga, Michael S. (2009). Human: The Science Behind What Makes Us Unique (1st ed.). New York: Harper Perennial.\n\nThe social mind? It sounds like you've been reading the social theories du jour. Human mind doesn't change. There are practical factors, such as cellphone addiction, but mental chatter is mental chatter. Meanwhile, scientific theories come and go. Sometimes there's some truth to them. But science is limited in these matters because it depends on empiricism and existing theories.\n\nComing from a Buddhist background, I see it in very different terms. According to the basic Buddhist teachings, we suffer mainly because we're attached to a false belief in a solid, enduring self. The habit of self, or ego, is maintained by the dual system of discursive thought and conflicting emotions. We're constantly involved with \"kleshas\" -- passion, aggression and ignorance. \"I want something to eat.\" \"I hate going to work.\" \"I couldn't care less about baseball.\" \"My lover is incredible.\" \"My lover is the devil incarnate.\"... It's a constant looping, which can be seen directly in meditation practice. That looping almost magically conjures an experience of absolute, solid reality. \n\nAccording to Buddhist teaching, the attachment to confirming self, which never actually works, is the root of the problem. Meditation is meant to see through the illusion.\n\nThe mahasiddha Tilopa famously said to his student Naropa, \"Your thoughts are not the problem. Your attachment to them is the problem.\" That was over 1,000 years ago.\n\nBelief in a solid, enduring self is an illusion necessary for survival and reproduction.\nReligion (belief in afterlife) is another illusion to live happily, comfortably, not to fear death, and to live happily in a religious group with similar beliefs.\n\nBut we agree that self is an illusion.\n\nYou've detailed two of your beliefs that I would not agree with. Belief itself is, by definition, a decision to regard something as true regardless of experience or evidence. That's merely dogma.\n\nFrom the book, to which I have referred, autotranslated to english.\n\n‚ÄûAccording to the proposed model, each stimulus triggers an automatic response of approval (approaching) or disapproval (avoidance), which can lead to a fully developed emotional state. This emotional state produces a certain moral intuition that can motivate the individual to act. Reasoning about a judgement made or an action taken occurs later, when the brain begins to seek a rational explanation for an automatic response of which it has no idea. Occasionally, however, our rational self actually participates in the evaluation process.‚Äù\n\nThat sounds like an accurate take if we assume human experience is mased in mechanistic operations. An interesting comparison might be the Buddhist idea of the 5 skandhas, which details how ego takes a moment of perception and converts it into full-blown dualistic \"reality\". \n\nThe difference with the skandhas is that the describe how the whole system works. The scientific theory you quoted is simply trying to come up with a possible scientific explanation. For example, how does a stimulous \"trigger\" positive or negative response? How does interest in perception of a chocolate bar lead to an emotional state? What is \"moral intuition\"? How does an emotional experience produce it?\n\n The theory is stating the obvious, without adding anything useful. It's just \"scientizing\" what we already know. That's what science does in its capacity as a religion: It explains experience inn scientific terms, thus giving us the sense that we understansd something.\n\nwhat is the \"social mind\"?\n\nIn short, the social mind refers to our mental and emotional responses to social interactions\n\nThis is just recognizing the map isn't the territory, not anti-intellectual at all.  Seems like OP may like Baudrillard\n\nNor is the \"territory\" the territory. It's anti-intellectual in the sense that it's idealizing not thinking. Trying to have \"direct experience\" is also a thought. This is a common misconception with New Age approaches; the idea that we can be enlightened if only we figure out the technique. \"Babies and prehistoric humans are just natural and present. We should be like them.\" But conceptual mind is still there. So conceptual mind begins to imagine what \"direct perception\" should look like and the result is performative enlightenment -- idealizing impulsiveness and spontaneity. \"I can never get enlightened being a boring insurance salesman, but maybe if I just move through experience without thinking, focusing on sensation, then I'll get enlightened. I'll just stare at birds in the sky and be one with it.\"\n\nIt all sounds convincing, but it's actually just very naive. It's a kind of return to Eden idea. Return to purity. But sensations are also thoughts. And these strategies are thoughts. We cling to those as much as to words.\n\nTo put it another way, there isn't some kind of pure, elevated experience to be had. That's a commodification of awareness. A belief that if we can only get rid of pedestrian habits then there's an amazing world to be \"consumed\". We'll be able to have a cosmic orgasm by eating an orange. That's the logic of going up a mountain to watch an amazing sunset; to have a perfect experience. But then we get there and there are mosquitoes, or it's cold, or we're hungry. And try as we might, we just can't possess that experience of the sunset, even if everything goes perfectly. Thoughts don't get in the way of experiencing that sunset. Dualistic perception itself is the obstacle. \"Me\" experiencing \"that\" as a commodity. The very idea that we can do something to get a better experience is stepping away from the direct simplicity of nowness. It's conceptualizing a superior experience.\n\nI love that last paragraph...the rest is far too elevated for my poor mind to deal with.\n\nBut you def hooked me with the sunset experience.  \nI always believed I loved nature, but interestingly, I couldn't love it when I was in it, which frustrated the hell out of me.  The only time that happened was when my eye would catch a wildflower or the famous shaft of sunlight shooting through tree branches in front of me, the look of the forest behind me, a weird mushroom, etc.  \nI've been to many \"forests primeval,\" which I've enjoyed but much more when I reminisce.\n\nThe first time I went hiking, I was uber excited and couldn't wait to be out in full nature, was sure it would entirely blow my mind.  Oh I saw gorgeous things but I wasn't able to really experience them.  I was so angry with myself. Maybe if I were into weed that would have helped, but no.  I very much relate to your description of dualistic perception.  And will look into it.\n\nI will tell you, I can go into a trance if I hear certain music or songs, where I am instantly, without thinking...in words, images, whatever....and finally in what I might call a kind of meditative state.   So I sort of know what that feels like.\n\nThank you for sharing these insights.  If you know and are willing to share any resources, (not too erudite!!) on dual perception, I'd love your recommendations.\n\nAnd then of course, some of us are just meant to experience life deeply. \"We don't look at sunsets, we feel them.\"  \nThat simple premise might explain at least some of what you said above in a much more complicated way.\n\nMy own background is Tibetan Buddhism, so I guess my viewpoint is mostly Buddhist viewpoint. But I spent years trying various things first, trying to astral project or have far out experiences. Trying to understand Lao Tzu and Jung. Maybe that's the natural first step -- assuming that spirituality is \"out there\" somewhere. It changed for me when I connected with meditation and a teacher. There are also options in Hinduism and even Christianity, as well as Zen. But I think a teacher and a path are required. Otherwise we're following a path based on our own preconceptions.\n\nI remember a phase around 20 y.o. where I was trying to find dates to go with me to see sunsets. I'd bring cheese and wine, to show how tuned in I was. :) There's a kind of confusion in that, which you've also detailed. It seems like it should work, but... somehow the experience doesn't quite arrive.\n\nThat's actually the imagery of preta (hungry ghost) realm in Buddhism. Pretas exemplify the mind of passion. They have big eyes, a big stomach and tiny throats. They're forever striving. A preta sees a cool drink to quench their thirst, but when they try to drink it turns out to be sand and pus. They see a delicious feast to satisfy their hunger, but when they try to eat it turns out to be shit and garbage. The point being that we're constantly setting goals and striving for better, but it's actually the desire itself that we're attached to. Desire confirms self. \"I want, therefore I am.\" Once we get what we thought we wanted it's confusing. We thought we were getting the solution, but somehow  we're still the same person. Nothing has really changed. It didn't work. The mistake we make is to rush past that and set another goal. Always thinking it's the goal that we want.\n\nSo very much relate.  I recall far too many times trying to set up the perfect \"whatever,\" and it just didn't live up to my hype, be it cheese and wine sunsets, the perfect surprise birthday dinner, dreaming of how he or she will react to my latest funny story, etc.  Always a fizzle.  Yet, when I didn't plan, I was often pleasantly surprised at responses and reactions I didn't expect.  Not sure what Buddhism says about that. \n\nI also feel much like a preta and recognize it in others.  \"Desire confirms self.\"  Indeed.  If believed, we live with disappointment for much of our lives.  No matter what you achieve, it doesn't satisfy.  You don't change.  \"You take yourself with you\" as someone once told me.  Let me ask, why is the preta's stomach big?  Seems it should be empty if the throat is so small.\n\nThe idea of the big eyes and stomach, with the narrow throat, signifies a big appetite but the inability to satisfy it.\n\nAh, ok, that makes sense.  I was wondering why  the big stomach that couldn't be filled.  Thanks.  This is what happens with human expectations.\n\nThat is one way to meditate, not exclusionary like you suggest though. That is judgemental.\n\nGiven the number of words you used here I really can't say as I follow your logic.\n\nWe have many different ways we can think, we should utilize them all. There is not necessarily a better or right way.\n\nWe are not saying to banish analytical and verbal thinking. We need it, otherwise we wouldn't be having this conversation.\n\nWe are saying tho, we don't need this constant train of self-talk thought, going on non-stop. And the glorification of descriptive language as a replacement for direct perception. You do not need to be explaining things to yourself to understand them. That is, in order to grasp something you have to break it up into words and then be able to see it. We are saying this is unnecessary. There is an even higher intelligence in coming in direct contact with whatever it is you perceive.\n\nAs someone else in the comments suggested, there are experiences in meditation words cannot describe.\n\nBut you're using words to try to describe this.\n\nI think this way all the time, it's called unsymbolized thinking. I exist in that state much of the time.\n\nIt is just one way, not better, not higher, just different.\n\nYou're stating this is a better, or a preferred state to with the description of it being higher? That is a judgement I can not agree with. It is just one way.\n\nOn the one hand, I came to the same realization as OP a while ago. I learned that if I just don't allow myself to think in words, I tend to feel much calmer, peaceful, and present. Personally I also never think the way you describe unless I make a conscious effort to.\n\nOn the other hand, yeah, I don't think it makes any sense to say the goal of meditation is to stop thinking in words. That is way too much of a generalization.\n\nIt's about the ability to learn to not think in words. It's not about not thinking in words. Does that make sense it's just that we know how to think in words. We need to learn how to not think in words during those times when they're not necessary\n\nI think what the OP misses badly and perhaps you as well is that language or no language, that's totally irrelevant.\n\nIt's the content of the thought not the thinking style that is important. \n\nYou're just using the wrong words :)\n\nThe OP has it right. It is relevant. It's a completely different way to experience the world without linguistic processing. You see things much more directly as they really are. Both thinking and not thinking are extremely necessarily and relevant.\n\nThe OP is suggesting it is true meditation. You agree with the OP yet say that both are necessary?\n\nCan you please fix that contradiction?\n\nThe idea that you can see things more as they \"really are\" first supposes that there is a \"true way\" to see something. Can you please justify that belief?\n\nThat brings so much prejudgement with it I really don't think you can see it.\n\nIn your attempt to agree all you've done is confuse more.\n\nI agree that both processing or symbolizing the world with labels concepts and constructs is essential for communication sake. But it's also really important to learn to be able to not process the world linguistically. Because words are not what they suggest. A tree isn't a tree. It just is and then we call it a tree. The word tree symbolizes what a tree appears to be smells like sounds like looks like feels like. Tactile and higher sense apprehension of phenomena is more real than the linguistics symbolization of it.\n\n Saying we can apprehend phenomenon more as it really is different from saying we are apprehending it in a true way. \n\n We can only focus on one things at a time. You probably already know that. If you're sitting in a front of a tree meditating on it trying to take it in for what it seems to be and you're looking at it you're trying to smell it You're hearing it you might even taste it and touch it those are direct sensory experiences of it. You're more likely to be able to  focus on those things one at a time. But if you're having a conversation about it in your head at the exact same time your mind is having to oscillate back and forth between word symbols and sensory experiences. That kind of approach is what complicates the meditation. Having the ability to not fix language symbols and internal dialogue on your object of meditation allows you to focus more clearly on the object witout that word distraction.\n\nI'm sorry, I can agree with almost nothing there and I'm not sure how to voice that disagreement. \n\nWhen I read the OP's post and look at what it's saying it does not say what you're saying. \n\nThat you think you can only focus on one thing at a time is also a mistake. \n\nI also utilize linguistic meditations in ways which you're suggesting aren't valid and you've provided no supporting argumentation for what you're saying. \n\nMy lived experience, your description and the OP's comments simply do not match in any meaningfully supported way.\n\nI don't think it's about a*true*way. It's a less inhibited and more direct way. Is less complicated and more senses oriented to confront reality with your senses rather than to try to encode and decode with language.\n\nThat is not at all for the OP phrased anything they said. \n\nI'm sorry not sure where this \"confront reality\" bit is coming from and you're so far away from anything the OP said I really have no idea what you're trying to add right now? \n\nThe OP is suggesting linguistic meditations are less useful then this other way, and that is not necessarily true.\n\nI think what he's saying is that they each have a place. Which is more or less what you're saying, if I'm not mistaken.\n\nThat is absolutely not the words that were used. Not even close.\n\nWhy would you take an interpretation like that from words that very clearly say nothing like that? \n\nWhy would you try to even speak for the OP in the first place?\n\nThe opening statement very clearly says you shouldn't think in words, that that is not meditation. \n\nThat's purely judgemental.\n\n&gt;Why would you try to even speak for the OP in the first place?\n\nSeriously? Only you can interpret what OP is trying to say? I think you are misunderstanding what the poster is saying, as explained in his reply to you, that is all. Don't be so defensive.\n\nThey are the only person qualified to interpret anything.\n\nThat you felt the need to take over from the OP's statements rather than letting them respond with your own interpretation is not relevant to this conversation. \n\nYou can of course have your own interpretation, in your own thread of your would like to make one instead of derailing this one further?\n\n&gt; They are the only person qualified to interpret anything.\n\nYou argue then that you yourself are not interpreting. Which is ironic, seeing as it's exactly what OP is talking about: direct knowledge.\n\nAs to your other point, I would counter that if you want to have a private conversation with OP, start a chat. As this is a public forum and I'm not breaking any rules, I will continue to comment when and as it suits me. Do not take it personally, I welcome comments from any other posters to any of my comments in any threads. This is not all about you.\n\nI didn't argue anything of the sort anywhere in here. \n\nI'm still waiting for the OP to engage. \n\nPlease keep the remainder of your judgemental assertions to yourself, there is too much you claim I've said that is simply not present here for me to continue to attempt to communicate with you. \n\nThere is not enough room in this conversation for your ego and anything else.\n\nVery well, Your Highness. I'll leave you to your *checks notes* non-judgment.\n\nWhy are you referring to yourself in plural?\n\nBecause it is an investigation we are doing together. What I see, you see. Being aware and conscious of that which we are talking about is not just my personal faculty. It is human faculty.\n\nThat makes no sense, thanks.\n\nAgreed. The primitive man also wasn‚Äôt meditating. This is a newer concept developed by a mind that *does* think more deeply and more complex.\n\nI'm not sure why you would say something like that which no human being on this planet could possibly know?\n\nHuman beings have been the way they are for 50+ thousand years. So that you think you can say anything meaningful about that is really not appropriate.\n\nSounds like you need to meditate more.\n\nWhy do you say that? I meditate extensively. \n\nYou won't gain the knowledge of lost history no matter how long you meditate.\n\nYou might meditate but you have zero self awareness.\n\nWhy do you say that? What do you think I'm unaware of? What exactly am I unaware of?\n\nCan you even state it?\n\nWhat about the music that is stuck in my mind since yesterday?\n\nit too, is language that you've grown attached too. isn't music language?\n\nI keep wondering if it's possible that my subconscious mind will bubble up a song to my conscious mind in relation to what's going on.¬†\n\n\nSometimes it's spot on and hilarious.\n\n\n\nOther times I'm not sure so I'll listen to the song and dissect the lyrics.¬†\nEven if it's still not clear it's enjoyable to me to do. But sometimes the theme is resonating with what is going on.¬†\n\n\nSo what might seem like a nonsense song and random might not be.¬†\n\nFun fact. Not all people think with an \"inner narrator\".\nEstimated 30-50% people don't have an \"inner voice\".\n\nYes, I have a friend who claimed to be like that. He said when he reads, he doesn't hear the words in his head but he \"mumbles what he reads in his head. And he doesn't have a sense of his own body unless someone touches him (didn't make sense to me either).\n\nTotally agree. There‚Äôs reality and then there‚Äôs the symbolic representation of it (words).\n\nAre deaf and non-verbal individuals all enlightened?\n\nWhat are you talking about?\n\nGreat points! As much as I agree to this argument in principle as related to an isolated individual having direct lived experiences (e.g., in meditation), the only reason I‚Äôm able to even hope to understand your point is us sharing a structural network to communicate the meanings, that is, language. Language does create a gap between reality and representation thereof, no doubt about it, but it has its uses - by reducing the reality to a signifier or a chain thereof, language tears understanding away from lived experience, yes, but as it does so, language also opens up a space for humans to co-create reality through itself, adding a layer of reality on top of the lived/directly perceived reality. It‚Äôs one of the most interesting problems in 20th century Western philosophy - what do we do with language now that we realize its limits and the constraints it puts on the direct experience (I probably read too much Jacques Lacan in my youth). I personally don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything to be done, language is a useful tool if not *the* tool we have as humans to co-create reality, and no one already socialized into the human society can hope to be free of language‚Äôs power to structure our realities. Eliminating the distance between you and the world sounds very tempting, especially when one realizes that ‚Äúyou‚Äù and ‚Äúthe world‚Äù are words/concepts, but when it comes to communicating any of these lived experiences, we gotta put the distance between the signifier and the signified back in action - no one can carry a tree with them all the time in order to always be able to talk about trees. I think once one understands the constraints of language in relation to its ability to represent reality, it becomes immensely easier to use language as a tool of adding a uniquely human layer to direct experience by skillfully communicating it to other human beings even as we‚Äôre aware of the limitations of this tool. Your post does just that - skillful communication of non-linguistic perceptual meanings through language. Pleasure to read your argument, thanks!\nEdit: a word.\n\nWe agree that word-based thoughts should be for communication with others, not for self-communication. That was the point. (Your community seems interesting, btw)\n\nAny \"meditation\" instruction that is a directive \"stop doing x\" immediately turns me off, tldr, not interested, you don't get it. Also, the less dope you smoke to come up with these \"revelations\" and more reading the masters you do, you might lose the ego and learn something.\n\n&gt; The mind has fallen in love with its own creation more than the actual real creation itself. Constantly listening to the inner verbal thoughts it is bubbling to itself aaaaaall the time.\n\nLike this post.\n\nIn Buddhism this is often referred to as \"suchness,\" or \"seeing things as they are.\" Cf https://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/s/B2ECLjXKfF\n\nThat's right, the description is not the described. We need more direct perception-intuition which is Intelligence coming at us. Not the intelligence of a clever man, not mine or yours but Intelligence, Universal Intelligence, which is constantly being blocked by repetitive thoughts which is nothing but a product of memory, also necessary for daily functions bake a cake, drive a car, speak the language etc., In other words, learned intelligence. The Intelligence we're talking about here is quite  different it is always new, fresh and available to everyone.\n\nWhen Einstein was asked: How did you come up with this or that equation? He humbly exclaimed, \"It came to me.\" Now, not everyone can be a physicist to attract such intelligence but it will operate in any other aspects of our lives. That's how creation happens i.e. nature, music, poetry, art, beauty in general when we're attuned with it.\n\nSo you're right, thoughts-words are blocking that direct perception. When we tell a child that this black bird is called crow, chances are this man will never look at this bird directly, fully for it has the knowledge of the word, crow.  There is a story of a young boy where in the classroom the teacher wrote the word house on the blackboard five letter word and said this is a house, but not for this boy-young realist. \"House is something I live in, it has rooms and many other things and not a five letter word,\" he says. With already built in talent, later he became a great sculptor for he did not allow thought to interfere with that Intelligence coming to him. In ancient Greece sculptor's before they start their work, they immersed in a deep meditation.\n\nThere are some anthropological assumptions being made here about species intelligence and communication.\n\nI agree. What do you suggest?\n\nI used to think in images and videos more often back then - now, I sort of use my inner monologue to help calm me down or to analyze things.\n\nReally well said. Ironically you verbalised many things I hadn‚Äôt words for ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è but all good\n\nThis is a very predictable output of how a human sitting for hours, desperately makes a meaning of it because it's all he has. Meditation, just like the gym is just a practice we put ourselves in to hone. Anything more than that, and you'd find yourself inventing 'semen retention helps build muscles' and 'stop thinking in words'. But that's just my opinion.\n\nThis is exactly what ancient Chinese philosopher Zhuangzi was proclaiming. We can only attain truth if we get rid of language and concepts.\n\nThis has always been the secret door to inner experiences. Society and mental constructs enslave but freeing awareness from the \"known\" and its endless descriptions leads to direct perception and non-duality which is the first step toward truth.\n\n[removed]\n\nTry this. Interrupt your mental chatter and see if you know still know what you were thinking/trying to say.¬†\n\n\nUsually you're reexplaining something to yourself in words. But you don't have to do that. We just have a habit of doing so.¬†\n\n\nPracticing this can free up a lot of unnecessary chatter and speed up mental processing, leaving you more ready for right now.¬†\n\nThe op is spot on with this post. It's a realization I had in my early teens 40 years ago. It's very clear as a buddhist-minded person interested in working with their mind. \nAs as the op said. But In my own thoughts I see the ability to communicate as only one side of the coin. From infancy we start to be taught to attach labels to things. And from labels we learn to create concepts around things. And from concepts we organize them into constructs. Is great to serve the establishment of communication with others but what is problematic is that were not taught the value of non linguistic processing or any way we can achieve it.. we also need to be taught how not to think. \n The ability to not think is in breathing practice. You can finde a lot of of information on the subject if you look up Samantha practice or even zazen\n. Zen philosophy and their breathing practice has shaped my life. For the last 40 years I've practiced and it's changed the way my brain functions and the ways I apprehend working with life and my mind dramatically. For the better. Over time you learn to see the ways in which we have self-programmed ourself and our mind into habitual looping pre-programmed thought patterns. Our minds become completely inundated by endless running thoughts. By focusing on the breath we learn to accept those thoughts realize that we are not those thoughts and those thoughts start to fade away. They lose their power and then we are able to create gaps of quietude. And in those gaps we see things as they really are. Or I should say that are much closer than what we would normally be when we're just symbolizing them through linguistic processing.. it's a refuge. Breath is. In all but the most traumatic events when we find our thoughts racing we can just return to focusing on breath. Then those thoughts drop away and we return to this baseline. It's like being reborn and awakening every single time we practice. It's the body important practice anyone can take up that I'm aware of. If you have any questions or need some good resources feel free to pm me.\n\n See chogyam trungpa rinpoche as an excellent resource for beginning breathing practice also  katagiri for Zen practice. Once you get the idea you don't have to adhere to any sort of religious or philosophical perspectives. It's about learning the practice and practicing it. Ideally it takes 40 minutes plus a day. And give it a good 10 years. Practice it throughout your life. The reward will be beyond your imagination\n\nThank you for sharing this knowledge with us. I started meditating almost 15 yrs ago, and it was Vipassana that stuck with me among all the other practices I was introduced to. 4 to 5 years ago my practice evolved into a combination of different things such as Vedanta, Mindfulness, etc...\n\nI think the system doesn't matter as they are all trying to lead the mind to the same thing: that state of thoughtlessness and the deepening of awareness.\n\nSamantha meditation or single pointed breathing practice usually precedes vipasana meditation somewhat as I understand it. Having the ability to calm and focus the mind allows one to better be mindful of obstructions or reactivity during vipisana practice. But I think there was even a time before Samantha meditation was a thing. When mindfulness meditation was pretty much what there was. I think shamatha meditation might be relatively newer to the practice.\n\nHow to do this?? How do I get started\n\nStart by stopping to take things for granted. We don't really pay attention to things we perceive anymore because we think we \"know\" them. Go beyond labels and information. When you are interacting with someone you know (or don't know), really pay attention to them, in the moment, they are more than their name and experiences you had with them. When you read something or listen to someone talking, go beyond the words.\n\nInformation, knowledge and insights are always limited, whereas perception and awareness without analysis is infinite (...and beautiful).\n\nWe tend to put an experience in a book of knowledge and ignore it after in search of more answers.¬†\n\n\nWhich is how I find myself taking too much for granted.¬†\n\n\nThe joy of simple experiences. It's so incredible that it could happen at all and here it is right now.¬†\n\n\nThere definitely is an imbalance for me however I grew up that focused on concepts and spoken language that needed to be reigned in.¬†\n\n\nLearning to use both is subjectively a more enjoyable way of living my life.¬†\n\nsit quietly\n\nTry this. Interrupt your mental chatter and see if you know still know what you were thinking/trying to say.¬†\n\n\nUsually you're reexplaining something to yourself in words. But you don't have to do that. We just have a habit of doing so.¬†\n\n\nPracticing this can free up a lot of unnecessary chatter and speed up mental processing, leaving you more ready for right now.¬†\n\nThis made me think too much. üòä\n\nIt is interesting to compare modern man to our forbears. In my understanding you are pointing out key distinctions but fail to identify the nature of the problem those distinctions reflect.\n\nYes, the modern man largely lives in a world of abstraction. Our predecessors did not. We intuitively feel direct perception without the abstract commentary is ‚Äúbetter.‚Äù But what do we mean by ‚Äúbetter?‚Äù Better how? If it‚Äôs better,  why does modern man have such a difficult time getting out of his head? What is this ‚Äòaddiction‚Äô about?\n\nWe, modern man, are out of touch with our own nature and the nature all around us with which we actually are connected. We have created a culture that tells us: you are not okay as you naturally are; you are not worthy of love unless you make something of yourself, unless you buy the latest toy, get a good amount of likes on social media and strokes from your family and friends. \n\nThere is our nature and our ‚Äúnurture‚Äù, the latter of which is not very nurturing. Our nurture in fact stands largely against our nature. \n\nFearing that we are not enough, we create a fictitious story about ourselves, exaggerating qualities in us we think people will like, and lying to ourselves about and denying the qualities that we think they won‚Äôt like. We become our own fake news.\n\nNow fictions are easy to create and very hard to maintain. For example: You convince yourself that you are fit but big boned when in fact you‚Äôre just overweight. The problem is the world is full of mirrors, actual and in the form of unkind people. As a defense to the growing existential threat of mirrors, you find the people and the data that support your fiction, and find a way to dismiss, discount or discredit the data and people that don‚Äôt.\n\nThis conflict is harmful enough when it‚Äôs just body image or one‚Äôs sexuality that has been falsified. The impact is catastrophic when it comes to deeper aspects of one‚Äôs being. Falsification of one‚Äôs natural temperament, emotions and gifts based upon the cultural input that you SHOULD be otherwise makes one dis-eased on every level of human existence.\n\nRather than embrace who we actually naturally are we go to war with our selves. And that war radiates out and roils our relationships with friends, family, community, nation and the world and with nature itself.\n\nWhat we call human thinking today is largely dissociation; a retreat into a fantasy world first undertaken because we are rightly fearful no one will approve of us as we are which then becomes a retreat from the hellish pain our falsification of self creates. We are on a merry-go-round of our own making, more miserable than merry.\n\nWe are near completely identified with the false guy we‚Äôve created. That guy will never want to stop driving our bus because it knows it will die if that happens.\n\nWhen each of us sits to invite meditation this guy is our default. Sitting and suffering with the pain of the separation from our own selves we‚Äôve created is the only way to being whole again. In my view, only then can the kind of thinking you‚Äôre talking about come to an end.\n\nNo words. Poor languagem it doesn't deserve such treatment, and all my stumbling phrases never amounted to anything worth this feeling.\n\nAll this heaven never could describe such a feeling as I'm hearing.  Words were never so useful.  So I was screaming out a language that I never knew existed before.\n\nAll this and heaven too\n\nFlorence + the Machine\n\nIs this related to the idea that talk therapy doesn‚Äôt work and instead somatic based therapies are truly the ones that heal?\n\nLots of conjecture about how humans think. I don't think in words, even though I can. It just doesn't come to me naturally. I would have to consciously try to do this with some effort. So I can sit in meditation without a single word, just a lapse on attention.\n\nThough that doesn't mean that I automatically have little distance between myself and the experience. Language didn't change us to some sick organism that needs fixing - some brains prefer this form of thinking.\n\nNever made sense when listening to Sam Harris explain how he \"sits behind his eyes\" and \"talks to himself\" all day long. \n\nCan we please stop with the assumption that your own personal experience is applicable to others. Thank you!\n\nI don't have an inner narrator. \nI just \"know' stuff and know when I think and focus on something.\nI would not call this an advantage.\n\nThis and some people use words so much they barely are able to understand eachother without verbal interaction. Me and my friends have pretty much like a telepathic connection and only use words in some situations.\n\nAmazing idea! Ultimately connected with experiencing the world without labeling everything through the internal mind chatter is reading without subvocalization (the internal voice that acts like a narrator).  \nIt is possible and for some people  \nthe natural way of reading. For me it is almos impossible to do it and i catch  \nmyself \"speaking\" internally when trying it.   \nTake the last word of the post  \n\"Blessing\" and try not to subvoculize it. You will see that the mind  \nprocesses the word as a whole, almost like a picture. Interconnected with the  \nrecognition of the word is an emotion that comes with it and an abstract  \nunderstanding of the meaning. With a bit of training you propably even  \nunderstand whole sentences as one building block. This way you can read way  \nfaster then it would be if you would have to vocalize every single syllible.   \n  \nUltimately it is propably very benefitial to read, think, meditate or do daily  \ntasks without heaving an internal narrator commenting on everything you think about.  \nThe fact that you can do all these tasks even reading without the inner voice  \nproofs that the voice is secundary and therefore often unnecessary at all.\n\nwho are you?\n\nYou, with a different personality.\n\nDo you acknowledge that linguistic processing is essential for communication with others?\n\nYes.  This is much harder to do than most people imagine, but when you succeed you will discover... let's say, huge untapped resources within yourself.  Anyone can do it for a few seconds.  Most find it impossible to do for one minute - without a lot of consistent practice.\n\nIt's about not doing which is not the same as not doing anything. When you and God disappear what is having the experience? A question that is unanswerable. You can only experience it.\n¬†\n\nExactly\n\nLike Eckhart says, don't try to put a name or words to every thought, feeling, sensation, object, etc.\n\n\nJust experience it."

There was reading material in the back of the seat in front of you, or you brought a book to read. Life still happened prior to cell phones.\n\nWas just thinking this.  All travel magazines though\n\nDon‚Äôt forget SkyMall. That was pretty entertaining.\n\nMichael Scott‚Äôs favorite magazine.\n\nyeah.  that's why i always bought a book\n\nAll covered in germs\n\nLife is covered in germs. We've made it this far.\n\nTbf a bunch of people did not make it, specifically bc if germs lol\n\nOne can self amuse by just thinking or what I do a lot in those settings: daydream. It refreshes with added benefits, actually.\n\nI always prepare a bunch of stuff carrying books, downloading podcasts but I end up staring/napping the whole flight\n\nI think the average person never flies on a plane in their life, or maybe a handful of times at most. Just looking out the window is pretty mind-blowing. But I can understand how the privileged few might get bored with it, flying back and forth every day.\n\nIts not always mind blowing.\n\nGenerally i choose the aisle seat. Because then if i need to use the bog i don't need to bother anyone else i can just get up and go whenever. I also have a bit more leg room. So i don't have a view. Also depends on weather or time of day whether you get a view or not. For me its probably like 1 in 10 flights i actually get a nice view.\n\nI did last time (had a window seat and nobody sat next to me) and i was genuinely content to view the outside for the majority of the flight. Saw some stunning stuff.\n\nBut yea generally flying is a miserable experience for me. Super uncomfortable seats, no space, lots of waiting around. Noisy etc.\n\nCan I ask vaguely what region of the world you‚Äôre from. As an Australian flying is the most efficient and quickest way to anywhere. So I want to learn more about where planes aren‚Äôt common! :)\n\nI'm in Europe. My mom didn't fly a plane until 2006, she was 48. We always went on holiday to Spain by car, and before we had a car, by train. My brother had never flown either, he does everything by car. He's 41.\n\nSame in Canada‚Ä¶ pretty impossible not to fly unless you only want to see one or two big cities for the rest of your life.\n\nPrivileged few? Have you seen the flight loads in the United States? July 4th one of the highest on record, please.¬†\n\nThe average American flies only a few times in their lives. Many millions of Americans have never flown anywhere. Many never will. And that's just the USA we're talking about. A prosperous, highly developed economy with a robust air transportation system.\n\nMe, I'm a pretty well traveled American. I've lived in Europe and Africa. I might fly somewhere once a decade or so. Thar's a lot, for an American, but still not enough that I've managed to lose that childlike sense of wonder from looking out the window of a plane. If you have lost that,.I'm sorry.\n \nWhen we're talking about the average person in the world, we're also talking about 4 billion people or so living in developing countries, for whom air travel is an unattainable luxury of the super elites. Most people never fly in a plane.\n\nOk, I see your point now. Yes, I agree for the average person in the world. Most in the world never do fly. I was looking through the lense of one country, not the whole.¬†\n\nI pay for a window seat. If I have my phone I follow along on the map. Without my phone I'll just look out the window.\n\nI got on a plane and looked at sky mall for however long we were flying.¬†\n\nCurb did a whole bit about this\n\nIirc the curb bit was sort of a repeat of a seinfeld scene with the same joke\n\nif i meditated more i would've realized that\n\nDr. K on YouTube did a video on it too.\n\nWell thinking is not ‚Äònothing‚Äô. Just sitting and thinking is something to do.\n\nPeople did used to talk to each other on flights (says my grandmas boyfriend)!\n\nBull-shit. If I forgot to bring a book to the bathroom I read the back of the shampoo bottle and so did everyone else.\n\nSame with raw dog sex tbh\n\n[deleted]\n\nNot only unplugging from devices, but letting our minds wander aimlessly. The mind is still in control, instead of us.\n\nWell to make a small correction: it‚Äôs not about control, but more about observing the body and mind while letting go of control. The desire to have control is one of the things causing suffering.\n\n&gt;meditation is focused effort\n\nThere are hundreds of not thousands of different ways to meditate, and not all of them include focus or effort. Some even call it \"just sitting\", or other techniques where you're not supposed to focus on anything not try to do anything.\n\nShikantaza or ‚Äújust sitting‚Äù‚Ä¶ one of the forms of Zen meditation‚Ä¶  has a specific meaning. \n\nIt‚Äôs true the mind isn‚Äôt focused on any object of concentration.  In that sense it‚Äôs different from other forms of meditation.  \n\nHowever, it‚Äôs not just sitting there dull and sleepy. \n\nThe mind is unfocused‚Ä¶ but taut‚Ä¶ broadly attentive to the slightest stimulus from outside, or the smallest thought generated within.  If any subtle sound were to appear in the room you‚Äôre in, you‚Äôd know it immediately. \n\nOne sits ‚Äúdoing nothing‚Äù but with their mind poised like a swordsman before a sword fight, where the smallest distraction or laxity would mean death.\n\nCan we stop with this fluffy ‚Äúanything can be meditation‚Äù nonsense. Me sitting there, with my mind wandering everywhere, with me actively thinking about nonsense, visualizing scenarios, having internal monologues, is NOT meditating. Meditating is a constant effort.\n\narguing about what meditation is is pretty funny though\n\n[deleted]\n\n*Living* is being, as not being is death.\n\nMeditation is being *with awareness.*\n\n[deleted]\n\nDistinctions are drawn along lines of contrast for the purpose of constructive dialogue, but yes, everything is one thing.\n\nIf, as you say, meditation is being, what is not being?\n\nThere are different types of meditation, some are about concentration, some are about contemplation, some are about effort, others about letting go, some are about focus, some are about returning to the object you just forgot. Some meditations are formal, others are not.\n\nThe best meditation is non-meditation.\n\nThe trend as a whole for sure, but *surely* given the principles of meditation in general than some people could be meditating this way.\n\n\nThey'd just have to be more purposeful/active in the process? \n\nWhy would someone choosing to be at peace with doing nothing in a stationary setting not be able to count as meditation?\n\nI just wish people would stop calling anything that doesn't involve actively doing something as \"meditation.\"\n\nMeditation is actually a very active ‚Äúdoing‚Äù of something. It‚Äôs impossible to do nothing. You‚Äôre either sitting and letting your mind wander, or playing a video game, or single-pointed-ascending your way through the jhanas, or‚Ä¶\n\n(I have the same issue with ‚ÄúI experienced egolessness‚Äù discourse)\n\nThe egolessness or ego-death conversations crack me up. If someone says, ‚ÄúI experienced egolessness‚Äù or ‚ÄúI experienced ego-death,‚Äù my question is, ‚ÄúBut who is this ‚ÄúI‚Äù that experienced egolessness or ego-death.‚Äù\n\nThat is so true!! I think people forget that, but also I think that referring to our own experience as something \"I\" did or saw or felt is just ingrained into our speech and the only way we really know of to describe anything we remember. The closest I've come to that experience was very difficult, because remaining  without any sense of what \"I\" was feeling, seeing, what \"I\" was discovering and how excited \"I\" was as it became more clear was very tricky and fleeting. It's very hard to not frame your experience as being your own. It's hard when your whole existence has thus far been centered only aroynd a \"self\". Everytime that self idea returned even if it was just my normal internal dialogue of \"I can't believe what I'm feeling\" or literally any thought that involved an idea of me being a thing whatsoever, the entire experience would begin to seem much further away, like \"I\" was not a part of it anymore. If I refocused and let the idea of a \"self\" dissolve and only thought of One, as a shared experience that was absolutely known and ever present, not something somehow new or separate but just exactly the energy that was and always had been, then it became accessible again. Briefly, until I of course would be distracted by my thoughts and become my own experience again. It was hard to maintain but I did it long enough to understand what it was.\n\nI never have felt ego death, but I feel like there was a small part of my existence where I was able to set it aside long enough to see what every ego out there is a part of together, and it is eternal. That's the most comforting thing to me. It's not dark or light, there's positive and negative all throughout, and it never dies or diminishes, that's the way it struck me. \n\nThis has only happened once so strongly that I was able to put it into words. I haven't tried to get back there because I don't meditate even close to as much as I should but I feel it would be possible if I really tried. It was the most restorative and healing experience, made me cry and shed my crippling fear of physical death, for the most part. Hard to never forget that, I still have to remind myself about that as my mind is very used to being afraid but I do know better now.\n\nI suppose if you believe in no inseparable, singular, irreducible \"I\", then you are always experiencing ego-death! (Seems kind of an either/or situation if you ask me.)\n\nThese are same ones who can‚Äôt sit still for more than 2mins or need to have a calendar packed to the gills. They often frequent r/productivity and are enamored with productivity apps. Crack open a beer and look off into the sky/sunset that‚Äôs my meditation. Y‚Äôall are getting way too philosophical and over complicating this to death.¬†\n\n[deleted]\n\nI don't think it's strictly related to today's modern addictions with technological stimuli. How many of us got our intro to long chemical names from reading the back of shampoo bottles when that was the only thing to read in the bathroom sometimes in the 70s and 80s lol Many of us still couldn't be present enough back then for a few minutes to take a shit without external stimuli\n\nBut picture shitting in the woods, you wouldn‚Äôt need reading material. Just the idea that anything could attack you would be enough. I believe it‚Äôs partly the enclosure and relative safety that makes us look for something to entertain us. I cherish those old shampoo bottle memories. I found it relaxing!\n\nI was a boy scout and grew up in the woods. I had to use the porn mag I found in a hollowed out tree on one occasion for toilet paper. I was reading the jokes while I did my business. Maybe I‚Äôm just an edge case üòÇ\n\nIt‚Äôs not even the amount of time it takes to go to the bathroom, it‚Äôs the mental discomfort with our less palatable body functions and desire to distract ourselves from them. Like you can stand in line without reading or watching anything for the same amount of time because there isn‚Äôt anything you‚Äôre actively avoiding paying attention to.\n\nSpeaking for yourself there friend. I relished the quantity and odiferous nature of my output as a youngster üòÇ\n\nIt depends. If someone goes on an 8 hour plan ride and reads a book, no one is going to say they are addicted to reading. I commute 1 hour each day by public transport, it makes sense to use that time somewhat productively.\n\nWell stated.\n\nI agree for the most part but even a lot of the most well rounded people would probably get bored or a bit uncomfortable doing absolutely nothing on a longer flight unless they have a meditation practice or just fall asleep.\n\nThis was literally a Seinfeld joke from the 90's: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBBQdFSvvTE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBBQdFSvvTE)\n\nthese kids today have no history ü§£\n\nThis thread is getting out of control! I know it, you know it, vegetable lasagna here knows it!¬†\n\nIf riding on a train sans electronic devices is considered meditation I'd be very worried for the future state of mental health.\n\nIt‚Äôs called being present. It‚Äôs pretty dope. Life‚Äôs dope if you just pay attention and remove your pride and ego.\n\nI don't like the name, but it is something very beneficial for your mind. \n\nWell, unless you do it with the intention of posting it online, then your benefits are diminished.\n\nnothing wrong with posting it online after, it's simply living existence and trying to be present with the day to day movements of life and your mind, some people especially young and addicted to screens don't have the capacity to be with themselves, honestly some of happiest times in life was when I had a balance where I could simply be with myself for a while and then engage heavily in life and in relationships/friendships\n\nYeah, depends on what your goals are. If you want to maximize \"dem spiritual gainz\" then it's advised to not share it with anyone. Just like you don't share your plans/ambitions if you want to harvest this energy to the fullest. But obviously no need to be this hardcore, for most of us socializing is important too.\n\nThis used to just be normal life.\n\nIt's not natural to have non-stop stimulation. It's bad for you. People used to be bored and sit with themselves all the time. There's a lot of evidence to suggest that being bored is actually a critical part of the creative process, and when you can grab your phone every time you experience even a slight whiff of boredom you're stifling your personal development.\n\nPeople who think this is weird are the weird ones ü•¥\n\nPreviously discussed here (157 comments):\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/1dtkws7/i_just_realized_that_people_who_rawdog_long/\n\nHahahaha this is the best thing I have read today. Can we please bring back the original meaning of raw dog because this is pathetic. \n\nHang on folks i gotta put my phone down so I can raw dawg life right now.\n\nIf the person isn't making any effort to observe their thoughts and sensations or their surroundings, meaning they are not directing their attention towards an object or noticing things as they appear in their consciousness then this is not meditation. It's just simply... Not using a phone or book.\n\nI'd assume most people who do this are mostly lost in thoughts or daydreaming during their travel, which is the opposite of meditation. But if they're sitting there, focusing on something like their sensations, and noticing when they are lost in thought, then you can call it meditation. \n\nBut then people can also focus their attention on music played through their headphones, which is also meditative. Maybe the person listening to music using their phone with attention, is actually having more of a meditative experience than the person who is \"raw-dogging\" but is essentially just lost in thoughts and daydreaming.\n\nPeople are making fun of it? Shit man, we're in trouble if that's the case.\n\nWell, we've (humans) lived without cell phones for a very long time. But the reading part, that's pretty easy to avoid also. I can tell in this era most people don't even understand what it's like to just sit and look at scenery and rest.\n\nI don't understand this post.\n\nThere was an article written on CNN.com about a \"trend\" of people *not* watching in-flight entertainment on flights of 4+ hours (and optionally posting that on social media).\n\nThe article referred to it as \"raw-dogging\". \n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/1dtkws7/i_just_realized_that_people_who_rawdog_long/\n\nAh okay. Thank you.\n\nDid not know there are even entertainments on flights nowdays.\n\nraw dogging it ...\n\n&gt;It used to mean something else when I was younger (lol).\n\nfor sure!\n\nBut now, \"raw dogging it\" meditation-style sounds exactly the way I'm always telling people how to do it because very few people can commit to a daily formal meditation. \n\nPlus, when you follow the prescribed path, you get the expected outcome ...\n\njust sitting there, on the train, in the coffee shop, in line at the DMV and watching your thoughts ... look out! people might learn something about themselves ... \n\nI say do eet!\n\nIt still does mean something else üòÇ\n\n‚ÄúYou keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means.‚Äù\n\nSince it has to do more with willpower to avoid entertainment, and distractions, plus filming it as some sort of egoic accomplishment in order to get \"likes\", then it has almost nothing to do with the art of and the goals of meditation.\n\nNot meditation, and indicative of profound alienation from life\n\nIt started as a joke tiktok of some girl kind of relating raw dogging a flight to meditating, jokingly. And then some article decided to make it serious for some click bait and called it a ‚Äútrend‚Äù. But it‚Äôs just clickbait. And intended to be a silly comparison\n\nThat is not what rawdogging means rawdogging means doing something without assistance so like rawdogging reality would be no medications or drugs that's why it's used in that way.\n\nIn my day it meant sex without a condom.\n\nYes that's the original meaning but it has become a dysphemism since\n\n&gt;dysphemism\n\nI just learned what the opposite of euphemism is lol. Thanks for that.\n\nLanguage is amazing and within a hundred years no one will know the original meaning at all and it'll just be a regular word people use like we use suck today or scumbag. Scumbag used to mean condom.\n\nCalled \"Pulling a Puddy\" where I am from.\n\nWow I didn't realize how unhealthy the general population probably is if this is a real thing\n\nI've made a new habit of walking without any input - no phone, no music, no doo-dads to fidget with - just me and pup and the moment (:\n\nAnd me :)\n\nWhat do you think we did before the internet?\n\nI think it's kinda bs. Humans didn't use to travel in singular groups surrounded by hundreds and possibly thousands of other singular groups all doing their own thing. Modern Life is way louder than it used to be and it has a real psychological effect.\n\nI think someone sitting with their headphones on the train staring out the window as far closer to meditation than someone who is sitting there subjecting themselves to an amount of noise and distraction and stimulus that you would never see 50 years ago let alone 2,000 years ago. Our brains were not meant to work this way. Headphones playing music or a book I think are way closer the a ground state of function than blasting your ears and eyes with city levels of nonsense.\n\nI've been taking my daily walk without music on my phone. There are moments of meditation in that hour. üòÑ\n\nHow's that?\n\n\\*if done right.\n\nWhile born out of the normalization of being addicted to constant stimulation, the metaphor is not inaccurate.  \n\nDistractions, unconscious thought proliferation, and excessive external stimuli are like a metaphysical condom that dulls your mind from experiencing reality as it is.  Deep meditation is like your mind raw dogging the universe.\n\nI just learned what raw dogging meant by the brilliant clap back after Frump said ‚ÄúMother Teresa would be found guilty of these charges‚Äù. Someone on Twitter responded:‚ÄùI don‚Äôt think MT was caught raw dogging a hooker‚Äù!\n\nBet the majority of those people's brains are full of racing thoughts though... I also don't agree removing reading. Depends on what you read I guess, but books are not \"stimuli\", they help expand your mind, improves creative thinking and creativity in general. Before social media and mobile phones most people were much more aware and living in the now. Those are the only two that need to be removed imo.\n\nBooks are more beneficial/edifying than phones and social media for sure‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre just not ‚Äúmeditating.‚Äù\n\nSomeone sitting there with racing thoughts is also not ‚Äúmeditating‚Äù.\n\nBring a book\n\nInteresting.  One might call this ‚Äúdoing nothing really‚Äù.\n\nDepends what the person is ‚Äúdoing‚Äù.\n\nIf they‚Äôre sitting there daydreaming about their past, or what they hope for in the future, or thinking about work, or thinking up their next invention, or thinking about how to solve a family problem, or fantasizing about sex, or wondering when the next meal is going to be served, then they‚Äôre not meditating.  \n\nThere are many different forms of meditation, but just because someone is sitting still and not outwardly stimulating themselves with a phone, movie, etc., it doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre not clinging to their internal dialogue for stimulus‚Ä¶ which isn‚Äôt meditating.\n\nRaw dogging used to mean something different.\n\nRaw dogging reality lmao\n\nOh, wow! I grew up in a small town, and we used to do nothing and had nothing, so we were all meditating?\n\nI did it on a flight from LAX to JFK just this week. \n\nAirPods and brown noise only.  I do it all the time when I fly.   \n\nIt‚Äôs just a long meditation session broken up by some sleep and some gazing out the window.\n\nI do this a lot lately. Just a needed technology break to enjoy the present without needing my phone.\n\nI‚Äôve been meditating daily for ~10 years now and I travel by air about once a month. I‚Äôve heard of this but it sounds absolutely awful to me.\n\n[deleted]\n\n‚ÄúRaw dogging life‚Äù without any distractions or self-medication from technology/entertainment. \n\nI‚Äôve also heard raw dogging life in reference to mental health and someone who doesn‚Äôt take/need anxiety/depression meds or similar. ‚ÄúY‚Äôall really out here just raw-dogging life??‚Äù Distractions can be used similarly\n\n[deleted]\n\nSorry, I read your question in a way that I thought you knew the sex-without-protection definition but didn‚Äôt understand how that translates to life, lol.\n\nI do it all the time. Just sit on my porch watching/listening to the birds . Or just sit with my goats and pet them. Or just sit in my recliner and sip my tea. People used to do that all the time before the advent of smartphones\n\nRaw dogging is when you bang a chick with no condom\n\nthat's simply living life and being with existence, I love the term raw dogging existence because it's quite funny, it will elucidate to you if you're not enjoying it, that being with yourself is hard, you're in bad company, and that means you should deepen the sense of relaxation by simply being with yourself\n\nkids these days use that term for a lot of stuff.  I‚Äôve heard ‚Äúliving an unmedicated lifestyle‚Äù referred to as raw dogging life lol\n\nIt‚Äôs boredom. Not meditation.\n\nYeah, I totally thought this was something else the first time I heard it...I got very confused about how people could be posting it on TikTok. ü§£ü§£ü§£\n\nThe way I've heard it described, it involves not just no entertainment, but also not eating or drinking anything at all for the duration of the flight. As far as I know, that can't be good for the jetlag!\n\nBut it could offer good opportunities for meditation in that people are limiting their stimuli, which makes it easier for the mind to quieten.\n\nThis should be a new internet challenge! Let's see who can go the LONGEST without any device! People would hella cheat but if you could have like screen time competitions where you get some sort of clout for having days long gaps where you never picked up your phone lol lets DO IT!\n\nYou can 100% meditate with a phone in front of your face. Our always-connected culture does suck, imo, but it doesn't stop anyone from taking a breath and realizing that they are pure consciousness without an ego or even a center.\n\nDon‚Äôt see what‚Äôs strange about it, people (especially gen z) just seem to be waking up to the fact that their brain is under constant stimuli these days. I do think a lot of people are just using it as an ego boost though because they do it for social media and compete with each other over it. Either way at least it‚Äôs a healthy trend and not something obnoxious\n\nü§£ü§£\n\nDr. K on YouTube did a video about this maybe 3-4 weeks ago.\n\nsleep\n\nI think the weird part about it is that it has become 'a thing' and gained a movement so to speak.\n\nBizarre and very positive, IMO.\n\nBeen flying a fair bit for the last month or so.  The number of dudes staring at their phone or, worse, having a conversation as they take a piss is astonishing.\n\nI really can't get my head around it.\n\n*Gameboy has left the chat*\n\nIf meditation means letting your mind do anything it wants while denying your bodily needs, sure. Yeah. that's meditation. ... I guess.  (not)\n\nI could have sworn we did this last week\n\n Remember when the stewardess would offer you whole selection of magazines and newspapers as you arrived on the plane.\n\nI used to take the lingerie section of Littlewoods catalogue in the bog with me.\n\n‚ÄúRaw dogging it‚Äù I think would build mental resiliency dealing with the general public. It would also make us more ‚Äúin tune‚Äù with our surroundings of course, and maybe create a bit of empathy. Not a bad concept IMO.¬†\n\nOh, childhood. üëç seems legit and I do often.\n\nSometimes I'll just stare at the wall for five minutes with no stimulus.¬† Feels good¬†\n\nwork steep bored deserted impossible tidy square sugar panicky berserk\n\n *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev)*\n\nI always have a crystal beaded bracelet or pendant to look at and ‚Äúget small‚Äù and shrink my head\n\nLike are you asking for an opinion?\n\nThis is called mindfulness\n\n&gt;even going to the bathroom without any source of stimuli like a phone or even reading something\n\nAre you serious that's pretty normal for most humans üòÇüòÇalso healthier as the process of shitting should be done mindfully to not push too hard and damage ones intestines. The mind should be focused on correctly cleansing oneself from any excretions these distractions bring the whole process out of balance\n\nComparing books w/ phone in terms of how we use them both seems misguided but yeah I love reading on the train, puts my ruminating thoughts to rest and I get inspired or learn something new\n\nWhy is everything, including mindfullness now, sexualized in our society?\n\nIt difficult, I recently tried to \"raw dog\" a 4 hour car ride and I could not do it. Really opened my eyes to how addicted I am to my phone.\n\nReading this thread while on the toilet\n\nNot here to brag but this is me since 2000 when i know this was called raw dogging. I like to quiet the constant stimuli inputs when in transit.\n\nYes it's stupid"

    "body": "I had a routine where during the whole month I meditated, and I don't remember which day exactly, but that day I decided to surpass myself and do more than the last time.\n\nI told myself that this time, I was going to be in the state of pure consciousness (because before my thoughts were really too present, but gradually I learned the technique to stay in pure consciousness)\n\nI meditated for about 3 to 5 hours that day, and I was PURE CONSCIOUSNESS from start to finish.\n\nI then got up from my mat, and I felt the slowness of time passing within me, the calm was SUCH that I couldn't write such a \"Christ-like\" happiness, it was as if I was ancient , forged in stone, built in something truly ancient, more than rock, aaaaah!\n\nIt's like feeling marbled, forged in stone and you're very calm but it's at the same time very... oceanic.\n\nIn short, I felt a deep state of silence and peace, of bliss.\n\nI sat on my couch as I usually did but it was very different..\n\nI looked at the birds through my window and I was amazed, I didn't even touch my phone, and so it must have lasted... (because my perception of time at that moment was really as if everything was slow, calm for about 10 minutes, but it seems to me that it lasted a good tens of minutes more..)\n\nMy state of Samadhi was subsequently 'broken' when little by little I regained my mind, my body had cravings for habits which, despite this, tempted me to withdraw from my state of purity.\n\nAnd then I resumed the usual course of my existence.\n\n\nIn this state, and I'm being real with you, let me tell you that I had NO THOUGHT.\n\nAnd when I started to listen to the desires of my body, that's when there was a thought, and THIS THOUGHT, it was energy, it's as if in fact, thought it was already fuel that consumes our stock.\n\nAfter 2 days of this meditation (still continuing my meditative routine, I obviously had other benefits after that)\n\nBefore I used to run the mental in the evening, but no... NOTHING anymore I couldn't put water into the mill, the thought consumes excessive energy you don't realize...\n\nTo draw a conclusion from all this, I would say that at first, you just need to want a few things for it to happen (just with the will)\n\nSecondly, control your body, your desires and old habits (on this occasion I didn't even resist..)\n\nAnd finally, I would say that meditating will save us all, I have never felt as good as this crazy session..\n\nIt's really a joy... Christique, I have the image of the \"old\" that comes to mind, everything that has always been there, for ages!\n\n",

I had hallucinations of colors, purple and green waves that came out of my eyes(weird) and wrapped around my body. I was complete bliss and emptiness. I got very stiff and my eyes went wide open. Any form began to absorb into me. It was profound, a little scary until I broke through completely and really changed my life.

No one thought you how to sleep or gave u any methods for sleeping u do it by yourself üí´\n\nWhich technique did you use?\n\nSo, I don't know if I said it, but I meditated regularly, I ended up understanding that the mind ends up giving up, and that it gives up more easily when I stop my breathing after a long stop and I start again. to breathe.\n\nThis is how I enter into full consciousness more easily by directing my concentration on the lack of air, and the benefit of catching one's breath!\n\nThen I end up focusing on the 3rd eye, and there I can stay in this state for a long time.\n\nIt takes time !\n\nDo you breathe like this outside of meditation to maintain awareness??? \n\nI worry if I do that it‚Äôd lessen its effect when on my cushion\n\nNo I do it inside, outside it's impossible to concentrate\n\nIt‚Äôs called kumbhaka, the period of holding breath.

Most folks don't understand if someone really is capable of sustaining samadhi states the last thing they'd do is coming to reddit and disucss about it. But such is the age we live in. Sigh.\n\nSustaining and glimpsing are very different. I‚Äôd consider OP‚Äôs experience a mere glimpse of the bliss of emptiness at most.\n\nTotally agree. Ego working even here that's why they hate\n\nVery good chance op did not experience samadhi. This sub trivializes this experience too much, but feel free to lap up his \"wisdom\"\n\nCareful there\n\nI know what you said. I cried that day!\n\nIve experienced some induced experiences, but I only felt what you describe very phew times... I think it was invoked by the breath, how did you do it? What technique or mindset did you utilise? \nI did feel ancient, like I had access to very primitive parts of me and I was in a silent, oceanic state of awareness.\nIt was the best feeling I've ever had.\n\nYeah we understand each other if we had the same feeling in a way..\n\nAs far as I remember, at the beginning my mind was present but I really had to make it go away and not let it echo far away in my mind.\n\nI understood that when I stopped breathing, all my attention was focused and my thoughts were no more.\n\nSo I continued until I felt \"ready/comfortable\" to give all my attention to the mind's full awareness, and I prolonged this state over and over again without even being aware of it. From this state, my goal was just to do it, to be focused on the void and not at all on the result.\n\nThen I got up and the world seemed really new to me\n\nBecause I do understand what your saying when you speak of the void, I've experienced that. I've also experienced having my breath so subtle that it wasn't detectible to the outside world, Including my vital signs.\n\nWhat do you mean when you had to make it go away and not let it echo in your mind?\nAlso, what do you mean when you say stopped breathing?\nBecause where you control you breathing or not, I think there's a component where you pay attention to your breathing regulating itself.\n\nYou have to meditate long enough to understand it.\n\nThe more you practice the more you will understand for yourself, when you experience this you will have all the answers, meditate!\n\nI meditate my friend, but I'm trying to understand what you said, because if you stop breathing, you die.\n\nThat experience is important, but its not Samadhi-- Samahdhi is consistent and sustainable, the only time you go somewhere \"else\" is if you cannot understand how \"else\" is \"here\"--- You were shown elements of what  you can be absorbed in, in every moment-- But you have not achieved absorption, as evident that it is not continually in your focus now--    \n\n\nBut now, you do have a series of images of reality that can be rolled around towards that point--\n\nYou are right, I would like to go deeper into mindfulness to reach this state, but in truth the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãjust focusing on emptiness second by second seems fascinating and productive to me than the state itself. is just a cherry on the cake!\n\nI looked up what Samadhi means online and the definition makes even less sense. ‚ÄúThe highest state of mental concentration that people can achieve while still bound to the body‚Äù\n\nWhat? So just concentrating really hard? Which I suppose is largely what meditation is. But if you die and leave your body you‚Äôre definitely not concentrating anymore since you‚Äôre dead.\n\nNot sure I fully understand.\n\nThe word concentration is likely not useful.  It's nothing like concentrating for a math exam.  \n\nAnd yes, we know from NDE accounts that we come from unfathomable love and return to unfathomable love.\n\nMaybe you focus on the wrong concept. Use concentration word as a result instead of a solution. But the real solution is just blank your mind by focusing on one thing. The breathing in and out. If something comes to mind as thought just let it slide and come back to the breathing. That's Samadhi for you.\n\nfloating effortlessly and timelessly in a sea of light that is radiating pure love\n\nWell samadhi is the state of being that you go into when practicing samatha/vipassana (at least to my understanding), and tbh I have found that the best and ig most easiest (even though not the way to put it) would be to meditate (you know criss-cross applesauce with hands cupped straight back and all that). Then once you reach the point of deep meditation or complete presentness that is when true samadhi takes place and then if you allow yourself to accept that emptiness, that stillness, then and only then will you understand samadhi. \n\nP.S. I‚Äôm pretty new to meditation and hope that this is helpful. This worked for me and has helped me a lot along my ‚Äúspiritual journey‚Äù so hopefully it helps you to and I wish you luck.\n\nI wouldn't believe the definitions of such stuff that you get online. The person who wrote this might be one who hasn't meditated 1 min in their lives.\n\nHow long have you been actively practicing meditation?\n\nWe are most likely living in an ancestor simulation anyway. The nature of reality has always been a lie.\n\nMy experience: https://www.aswathkrishnan.com/2023/01/from-ordinary-to-extraordinary.html\n\nHow long have you been meditating before this experience? How long do you meditate each day?\n\nIf you had no thought, how did you know in which sequence what happened?\n'will' is a skanda that forms following 3 previous skandas:\n1st form\n2nd sensation\n3rd perception\nThen 4th is the mental formation that can manifest as will.\n\nForm is whatever appears to the 6 senses. Sensation is taking it either pleasant unpleasant or neutral. Perception is attaching labels to the perceived thing. Mental formation is one or some mental factors in a mix appear from among the 51 mental factors. It's followed by consciousness, the sense of being. The whole thing functions based on ignorance and attachment. So if your goal is to lay down suffering once and for all, be very careful, since meditative experiences if taken as something real they nourish attachment and ignorance.\nIf you don't want liberation, then you can disregard everything I said.\n\nDid you have any crash down or saddnes when you came down? Or did ku dalini awake? If you feel kundalini coming make sure you‚Äôre rooting!\n\nSo..I had a funny experience with kundalini..üòÖ I didn't particularly meditate in fact..it happened in a strange way..\n\n..\n\nYou ask the question I answer you\n\nDid you crash I asked?\n\n? Why are you responding unkindly?\n\nI believe you 100%. The same thing happens to me and now I can do it whenever I want. I focus my sight on the tiny little air particles and then everything starts coming together. The first time what I saw and kinda felt with my fingers was like the lightest sheer fabric. I don‚Äôt know how to explain it but a very light net or electromagnetic field. It‚Äôs started translucent and then I got the colors in march. Keep going you can do much. ¬†\n\n&gt;  \nAnd when I started to listen to the desires of my body, that's when there was a thought, and THIS THOUGHT, it was energy, it's as if in fact, thought it was already fuel that consumes our stock.  \n  \nBefore I used to run the mental in the evening, but no... NOTHING anymore I couldn't put water into the mill, the thought consumes excessive energy you don't realize...\n\nIn these two lines, do you mean that having even **one** thought consumes a lot of energy on a regular basis (that you found out through meditation) or is it due to the effects of your meditation that **one** thought consumes a lot of energy? Or did you mean something else entirely?\n\nNot Samadhi‚Ä¶\n\nWhy\n\nThere‚Äôs many reasons from the post‚Ä¶ the general approach towards wanting ‚Äúyou need to want a few things for it to happen‚Äù, the opinion that control is a path ‚Äúcontrol your body‚Äù. Could really put most of what OP said under a microscope and see it‚Äôs in conflict with known respected teachers and validated cases of samadhi.\n\nThis just reads like someone who read about samadhi, meditated a lot, and then their mind filled in the blanks as to what OP envisioned samadhi being. It‚Äôs not different than anyone else who comes in with some crazy meditative experience after some more than usual periods of meditation.\n\nSamadhi is attained via letting go, not control, not wanting.\n\nDon‚Äôt know why you getting down voted for stating the truth"

    "title": "The impact of quitting marijuana on my meditation",
    "body": "I saw some questions here about the effect of weed on meditation, so I decided to share my own perspective on it. I'll discuss my practice and give you a review of how quitting weed has changed my own experience of meditation. I am not here to make any judgment about what is right for you. I am simply offering the opinions I have developed from my own life.\n\nMeditation isn't necessarily something that I do on purpose. It's just something I find easier to do than surfing the internet, playing video games or watching TV. I sit away from any screens or electronics for half an hour in the morning and for half an hour before bed. This isn't the result of any hard discipline. It's a habit I've fallen into because it makes my life easier. I just sit where I'm comfortable and I breathe.\n\nI used weed on and off for about 15 years. It was something I did for fun with my friends until they moved away. I started with smoking, switched to vaping, and learned how to make cannabutter. I transitioned to hemp-derived cannabidiol (CBD) when that became easier to acquire, and very gradually needed THC less and less. I quit THC completely more than a year ago, and presently take only CBD powder or THC-free hemp for anxiety or when I have to sleep.\n\nI think meditation is easier without marijuana. After quitting, what really amazed me were the memories that came back. There were times I felt like I was waking up from a coma. It didn't happen all at once, but the longer I went without it, the happier I felt that I had quit. I'm more alert and responsive, can easily read books and talk to people, manage my time, and feel more in control of myself. I still drink an occasional beer, but am happy without weed after 16 months without it.\n\nMeditation helped me to take an objective look at marijuana use and to make the decisions that are best for me. In my practice, I stopped using THC by substituting it for CBD. Now my mind is more alert and responsive, better able to recall memories, stronger in reading and writing, and more effective in communication. \"May your meditation bring you peace, happiness, and bliss\" -- Swami J",

Motivation diminishes, clarity and sharpness of mind diminsh, mistakes are more prone to happen, etc... In the end, I always realize that its not something to be done regularly and most certainly shouldn't be using it for meditation, for me.\n\nMy best moments have been when I was meditating regularly and with discipline every day at 5AM without any assistance of a substance. I was sharp, intuition was on point, almost predicting the future from how intune I was with my surroundings and awareness. \n\nWhen asked if to use weed for meditation, I give these same details. yes, you can get into a real deep meditative state and have a great session, but do you really want to rely on weed to do this? it is far more powerful to be able to do this naturally and consistently on demand through your day. \n\nIn the end, weed is ok if you just want to hang out one day with your significant other or your friends relaxing, but not to be done regularly for practical use. It will hinder you, make you lazy, affect your breathing if taking via inhaling, etc.. the negatives outweigh the positive by far, in my opinion. To those that rely on the weed for anxiety and depression, I still feel it is not a good idea because you are masking something that needs to be worked on, just like those who drink to feel better. \n\nLastly the indicator I have used to know the weed is hurting, is when I start using it, the first few day sor even couple of weeks its great im feeling good, meditation is good, etc... then as I continue, I notice that when I use the weed, I feel uncomfortable and start getting feelings of anxiety, depression, sadness, darker thoughts, etc... When you get to a point where the weed is making you feel like this, this is when you know that it's time to let it go. This is because you have reached a 'frequency' where the weed is no longer elevating you, instead of bringing you down.\n\nHad kinda similar experience to your last paragraph. However, I view the lack of enjoyment the more you use it to be positive. I feel as if the plant is telling me, \"Hey, you gotta stop a little. You started abusing me and using me as a crutch. The next time you use me, I will make your experience negative to remind you. \"\n\nTherefore, I keep my sessions either weekend only or only when I really need some guidance. If I don't abuse it, I find it immensely helpful. Easy to slip though, so awarness is needed.\n\nThe easy to slip activities suck the life out of us and keep us from being fully sober. You can't see reality clearly this way. They are absolutely a hindrance, they never really go away and they can't be fully moderated. I've never felt more like myself then when I've stopped them completely. My mind has never been so functional and open without them. All that being said, reality is harsh. I hesitate to say moderate wisely, it's more like compromise wisely.\n\nIt's really good to know that you are less and less dependent on weed for doing Meditation and you can see what meditation actually is. \n\nYou see, in Raja yoga or generally, the whole concept of Meditation is to let go and know the real \"I\" within ourselves. And that \"I\" is not dependent on anything. And once you realize that more clearly,  you will be less attached to all the Earthly things including weed and other emotional &amp; Physical attachments. And once that is gone, you will find yourself in so much peace that your brain will give you the effects of weed without even consuming the weed. \n\nKeep up the good work and I hope that you will help you üòä.\n\n&gt;  your brain will give you the effects of weed without even consuming the weed.\n\nCan vouch. The doors are always open. Drugs are self created mental keys to specific set of experiences, the exact map of which key/drug  unlocks which door/experience is defined by your own collected trauma that will reject or resist this idea. Some psychedelics carry an inherent body load, ketamine for example will make you go numb. more pure psychedelics like lsd do not carry this bias. And lets not forget thc, mother natures psychedelic, green plant form is more desirable than musky shrooms if you ask me, and if its potency you seek, 5meo is the way.\n\nCasually mentioning 5-meo-dmt like it's easy to get lol\n\n&gt;it's easy to get lol\n\nIt could be, if more people were aware of its medicinal potential.\n\nCan't you make it at home\n\nThat's effort lol\n\nFacts gotta take the path of least resistance ü§£‚òØÔ∏è\n\nHonestly I've been thinking about getting some MHRB and doing a pull; laziness has been the only thing preventing me.\n\nI prefer to say natural survival instincts prevented me from action but to each their own\n\nI don't think smoking dmt is gonna kill me\n\nLove seeing other people realize weed was really just a crutch. \n\nDon't get me wrong I still love a good toke from time to time, but really understanding my relationship with weed was a huge game changer and I hope everyone really evaluates their relationships with weed!\n\nWhat did you think it was before? Limitless drug? ü§£\n\nNo but I pretended it was a cure all for anxiety and a few other things.\n\nI feel you. Treatment =/= cure for sure\n\nWeed will bring to the forefront subconscious thoughts which you had been ignoring or failing to entertain. There are pros and cons to this. Imbibe at your own discretion.\n\nWeed supresses emotion, and hightened emotions (or simply being aware of inherent emotional processes) can be one result of meditation, depending on how far you take things.\n\nProblem with weed use is that like most things in life, it has the capacity to easily turn into a habit. Personally I like the sound of a strong edible hitting me deep with relaxation seldomnly when I really need it. I suppose that like anything else it is best used sparingly like that, otherwise it becomes a flat, hollow, habitual experience. Seems like the more you use it, the less you get out of it.\n\nAnother thing is that, at least based on what I've seen, it isn't safe using a psychedelic (even if a mild one) with meditation. I don't think people realize just how fragile the mind can be. It can also be resilient, sure, but why gamble with your mental health?\n\nBeen meditating 7 years consistently and at the same time started smoking bud , it‚Äôs all subjective, it‚Äôs all different personal experiences, if anything weed for me enhances my meditative experience. \n\nSmoke on an off but have been meditating consistently 7 years without missing a day\n\nThank you for this. I‚Äôve been searching for at least one positive anecdote!! I‚Äôve been smoking at night time but still have so many positive effects from meditation. But all I see is how much it holds people back. I was wondering if I was tricking myself. Still could be, but nice to see this comment\n\nYou‚Äôre only tricking yourself if you believe you are if you‚Äôre not you‚Äôre not\n\nIt does the same for me as well. It heightens my meditation experience. It also helps me when it comes to creativity. That's all dependent on whether or is sativa or indica.\n\nI‚Äôm also not going to judge others‚Ä¶ \n\nGoing ‚Äúclean‚Äù gave me clarity which I have really come value. Drinking and smoking (which I definitely overindulged) seemed to put a hazy film over my senses.\n\nI've been meditating daily for about 3 years now. There's been some personal issues that I am mindfully examining which I would love to be finally free from. It's been a struggle. I am wondering if my light weed use is getting in the way or helping. When I'm high (not during meditation)  I feel very close to my body, to the world. Small bugs and clouds are endlessly interesting, but it's very hard to keep my attention in the present moment for any length of time. When I'm not high the bugs and clouds are interesting in a more subtle way but then it's fairly easy to return and stay in the present moment.\n\nFor me, is this a crutch or an aid to meditation? Or is it another illusion? I hope to learn more what others think.\n\nThank you for sharing this. I have to admit after reading this I don‚Äôt feel as stupid for thinking that thc may be the reason I don‚Äôt function at 100%. Looking back, I realize that when I stopped smoking years ago, that I had better memory, better mood, etc. now I‚Äôm not saying that weed is bad or makes you unable to function. It‚Äôs just my opinion and how I‚Äôve experienced it. You‚Äôve given me a lot to think about and a lot to reflect on and the motivation to stop smoking again.\n\nYeah I most definitely do not want my memories coming back that was the whole point for smoking that shit ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£\n\nFor me, if i use it maybe once or twice a month, it creates a lot of clarity. It's like my mind is in freeze mode, and meditation and journaling help a lot, but if i use weed only on special occasions, it's like i manage to look at things from a different perspective. i call these moments revelations. i have pmdd, and im also neurodivergent so it might have something to do with that. however, if i start using weed every day or even a couple of times a week, as everyone else wrote in here, it makes you sluggish and allover in some kind of haze with your emotions and memories. if i use it once a month, it has the complete opposite effect. when i am high, i get access to memories i haven't seen in years. i believe everything can be used to ur advantage but in good measure. the biggest thing i accomplished is controlling myself and my usage of it. i truly enjoy smoking and the state i am in when i am high. However, daily use and dependence on anything isn't good for ya. i have to mention as well that, along with all of that, I've been going to cbt therapy for my pmdd which helped me cut down immensely.\n\nI still have some when I'm struggling with depression because it can really help to lift my spirits when I'm going through a very hard time. Meditation helps a lot too but sometimes I need something instant and weed can do that for me. \n\nI prefer sober meditation and hate meditating with weed in my system as I can feel it making the meditating more difficult and \"dirty/muddy.\"\n\nI never drink alcohol though and I never will. I'm suprised with all your experience with weed you still prefer beer over small hit.\n\nThank you for sharing this. üôèüèºüôèüèº\n\nWhen I quit weed, my focus greatly improved. Of course this translated into better meditating. The states I‚Äôm able to reach in meditation are similar to a high, but much clearer and more profound. I couldn‚Äôt do it if I was still smoking.\n\nI had to stop smoking weed because I didn't need to play Russian roulette with an existential crisis-induced panic attack every time I smoked\n\nCool thanks for sharing. Just curious do you meditate eyes open or shut?\n\nThis sounds about right. Grats on quitting!\n\nAnger is always the big one for me when taking a break from cannabis. ( for ptsd - it works for me. everything else is poison imo). Non stop trawling thru a world of self-rightous anger for a few weeks.\n\nDid a zen retreat one time in the worlds most beautiful place with a master. Rage. Lol, non stop. I try to just observe it these days.\n\n[removed]\n\nLet me know how it goes. I am thinking of ceasing the habit too.\n\nI never smoke or vape it as I know the effects are very short term. I use tincture instead, either sublingually, or orally mixed into a glass of water. I do not use it as an aid to meditation but rather for better sleep most of the time. I have used it during the day to test the effects and figure out dose levels. I will not say the high enhances meditation, but that mindfulness learned from meditation enhances the high.\n\nI don‚Äôt see how anyone can properly get into the void if they‚Äôre stoned on weed. The two are not compatible.\n You really need to be focused &amp; on it whilst in &amp; trying to receive anything from the Void.\n\ngreat trip.  enjoy while it last"

I'm bookmarking this!ü§å\n\nwhat were some answers or downloads that came your way from asking this?\n\nHonestly meditation and reading have been extremely helpful for me. I was meditating by a lake in a forest not too long ago and the sound of the leaves rustling by the wind gave me the most profound feeling. I never meditated outside and that was my first time. As I grounded myself, it‚Äôs as if something snapped in my mind.\n\nFrom there on, I have not stopped. I‚Äôve been reading, journaling, meditating in a way I‚Äôve never done. Learning about how animal instincts and behaviors are more dominant than our subconscious made me understand that my trauma and my emotions and bad behavior were only hindering my growth and progress. I made undeniably terrible mistakes and hurt people I loved. That is not the way.\n\nIt‚Äôs as if I was aware, but not self-aware. It has been a true transformation and the more I learn and meditate the more the puzzle begins to fit together. When I start to feel a negative thought, I become aware that a thought is coming, process it, and let it go. Replace it with a positive and a question. I do my daily breathing check ins through out the day to remind myself to be in the present. \n\nWho knew it would be a game changer. üòÑ\n\n&gt; It‚Äôs as if I was aware, but not self-aware.

I know this from experience because anytime I would put myself down, I would be dwelling in my self pity and things felt wrong. I felt awful of myself and felt worthless. I would feel heavy.\n\nThis is just an example of how it went today. :)\n\nIt‚Äôs a matter of constructing a positive thought.\nFinding the course of action to make it happen and continue the course of it.\n\nThanks bro, much appreciated\n\nNo problem homie :)\n\nThank you for this. I think I'll try to copy your practise!\n\nMy pleasure! Hope all the best for you! ‚ô•Ô∏èüòÑ\n\nHi, your text caught my eye and would actually try and follow this experience, what books are you reading? Also, I have a keen awareness that we have a conscious and subconscious mind, but I never made a distinction between the subconscious and animal instincts though I'm aware of it's existence in us, I've always put it under the umbrella of the subconscious, apparently you do the inverse and put the animal instincts as primary, could you explain what you mean by animal instincts, the subconscious and perhaps how they interact between eachother?\n\nSo currently I am reading ‚ÄòThe body keeps the score‚Äô, I‚Äôve read ‚ÄòThe Four Agreements‚Äô and ‚ÄòThe circle of fire‚Äô. Now you don‚Äôt have to take all these books into consideration. Great for getting the information you want and need. Take what you need from it. I also read a lot of articles online on neuroscience that dictate in the difference of the conscious and the subconscious mind. According to what I‚Äôve read, we use 5 percent of consciousness compared to the 95 percent of the subconscious we don‚Äôt. \n\nFrom what I‚Äôve read being the animalistic instincts or reptilian brain as they call it, being the basic survival instincts we have. Such as: eating, mating, drinking, breathing, fight or flight, sleeping, etc. things we do on a normal. Which is why people with trauma tend to stay in that fight or flight mode for a period of time because it stores in the body. \n\nAs I‚Äôve read, our subconscious stores as a memory bank in our brain and files everything we do/say. \nThe neurons between the conscious and the subconscious communicate with each other. They work hand in hand together without us realizing it. \n\nThe subconscious will filter out information and bring it to your conscious. Which is the awareness that we have right now. For example, as I‚Äôm typing. \n\nFor example as well, the feeling of reactive anger is a reaction of our subconscious and conscious working together to create a reaction. But it‚Äôs the process of the animal instincts/reptilian brain at play there. It‚Äôs what makes it occur rather quickly. \n\nHence when meditation comes in. \nJournaling and reading helps out too üòÑ\n\nThanks for explaining, everything you said is very similar to my thought process lol... Even the way you explained seems like me typingüòÖ, I also journal and read alot about neuroscience too, also meditate. Thanks for helping me organise the difference between the subconscious and animal instincts. I know that our conscious mind is only responsible for about 5% of our subconscious, we have access to all our subconscious, but only 5% at a time I'd say. You helped me remember/ clarify how everything we do supports the reptilian brain first and foremost, that the subconscious mind is like a museum of information by which we can only see it a frame a time. Thanks for your time, the way you explained it was very concise and clarifying, it's easy to see you are also passionate in these studies üòå.\n\nHahah, nice! Great minds think alike! üòÑ \n\nI do all of those things combined as well. Neuroscience is my favorite. Learning how the brain works is intriguing. \nIt has helped me a lot recently and we all have our ways of how we experience enlightenment/change/happiness/perception. \n\nIt‚Äôs incredible how a small percentage of brain usage makes such a big impact to the rest of the brain. The brain is a powerful tool. For good and bad. Which is why I am digging deeper into the subconscious and how it plays out in the trauma I had in my life and I projected it all these years.  \n\nAbsolutely, my pleasure! Anytime!\nWell thank you. I really do take passion in these studies and just enjoy learning. :,)\n\nI read some of ur responses and it looks like we like similar books. I just finished Breaking the Habit of Being Yourself. Have you read it yet? If not, I think you‚Äôll enjoy it. It bridges neuroscience and spirituality/ mindfulness in a way that I think people would find useful. Especially if you‚Äôre intrigued by how the mind works\n\nOh you just peaked my fancy! I will definitely check out that book! Thank you so so so much. Neuroscience and spirituality is literally my bridge right now that I‚Äôve been into. It helps out to know about the brain as I get into more of my spiritual side. Thank you. I‚Äôm excited to read it now!\n\nI had a very troublesome 2019 and after months of not being able to do basic day to day stuff like sleeping eating i spiralled into such a deep pit of nothingness and grief that i almost started losing myself and everything around me. But then i found and got into this heartfulness meditation centre in kolkata and met a few mentors there who literally picked me up at that time and saved me. Got me back in the grind, helped me find my side of mindfulness and relearn spirituality. \nBut fast forward now i feel i am leaning back into the same pit and turning back to autopilot, hope i get my way back out soon.\n\nI feel that. I‚Äôve been so up and down with my life. It‚Äôs been a jumbled mess. I can definitely admit I lost myself in the process. I‚Äôm sorry you had to go through that. That is so awesome you had help and it helped you get in tune with spirituality and mindfulness. It‚Äôs okay to fall sometimes. We are only human. At the end of the day, just try your best. We are not perfect. But what we can do, is try and if you fail, you try again. If you‚Äôre feeling that you‚Äôre falling back into that pit, remind yourself of the time of when you were getting that help to become mindful and spiritual. Remember how you felt. Or tell yourself some affirmations. Tell yourself ‚ÄúI will get out of this pit, I know I will.‚Äù\nYou could even ask after ‚ÄúHow will I get out this pit?‚Äù Your brain will start searching for answers. Maybe: ‚ÄúI will do a quick meditation or breathing exercise, etc‚Äù I still get negative thoughts and emotions a lot. But I do my best to replace them and acknowledge them and challenge my brain to find an answer. The mind is a trickster. Re-wiring is tough. But possible.\n\nI was now reading the part when you mentioned that you substitute the negative thoughts for positive ones, normally what I do is I notice the thought, but then focus on the sensory experience of my stomach and relax it. I noticed that if I want to ground myself my attention naturally gravitates toward my belly and hips and this seems to be true when I do taichi as well. You're likely familiar with the top down and bottom up modes of experience as a concept, well I notice that my mind becomes more bottom up oriented when I focus and relax on my belly (the diaphragm, bladder and that muscle that holds our pee in when we contracts)/ dantien. I think the whole point of meditation and I actually feel more primal and associate meditation with a very animalistic side of myself.\n\nVery neat insight. When it comes to the negative thought I definitely feel it from top down as I try to relax myself. Some of them cause anxiety that start at the belly and lead up to my hand and make me feel shaky. \n\nThat‚Äôs pretty interesting to know honestly. I learn something new everyday.\n\nI love this. I aspire to do what you are but never make the time. I‚Äôm dealing with caretaking 91 year old parents so my focus unfortunately totally on that and not my own well being.\n\n91 year old parents? Wow, that‚Äôs incredible. Very nice of you to be taking care of them. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs a lot of time and effort put into it. If you have at least 5 minutes to close your eyes and breathe deeply, that can help. I always have a lot on my plate and I also work 6 days a week. Sometimes just in between work I‚Äôll stop and breathe for a second. If you want to take mental notes, maybe do a quick 5 minute jot on a notepad or perhaps your phone. 5 minute grounding or meditation. Your well being is also important. :,)\n\nYes, my therapist just recommended this to me the other day she said start out with just taking five minutes to meditate five minutes to breathe and listen to five minutes of a book on letting go that she sent to me. She said I can carve out 15 minutes of a day and she‚Äôs right, I have just been so obsessed with my parents and their medical and emotional upheavals I haven‚Äôt taken the time for myself. I‚Äôm going to try again tomorrow just because of your post!\n\nThat is very good that your therapist recommended you that. I definitely do recommend it to you as well. Just a little bit of time makes a big difference. You don‚Äôt have to spend hours on end. A small step can make a different outcome. Completely understandable about your parents. I would be the same way with them especially, the age they are in. Their emotional health and their health is very important. Aww, awesome! Give it a small shot and see how that works out for you. I hope all the best. You got this! :)\n\nThank you. The internet can be an amazing place, glad I happened to see your post. Have a beautiful evening\n\nHave a beautiful evening as well! We are all in this together at the very end of the day. We have to support each other. I wish you the best of success on your journey! :)\n\nRemember you have to put the oxygen mask on yourself first, before helping others.\n\nUgh I know!  I‚Äôm so co-dependent, sadly I only made 1 of the goals today that I promised myself last night I would do\n\nMeditating enhanced my reading experience too. I remember a calm mid morning/ afternoon I was reading a fiction book outside and for what felt like the first time I had a similar feeling ‚Äî listening to birds chirp, leaves rustling, light cool breeze, fresh air and I was in my body but lost in a good book. Present. It felt like sensory overload but in a good way. \n\nQuestion.. when in public like the lake, do you meditate with your eyes closed too? I always wonder if someone was to pass me by if they‚Äôd think I was okay or had something going on lol so I usually meditate in private.\n\nI have been able to take in more information from reading after meditating and it‚Äôs truly a wonder. Exactly. That is exactly how I felt whenever I was meditating. It was definitely a sensory overload, but it was a very pleasurable experience. It felt just right. I could feel all over my body feel present in that moment and I‚Äôve never had an experience like that. That is super cool you had an experience like that as well. \n\nI definitely did meditate with my eyes closed at that time and to be honest, I did not care who saw me or what they thought about it. It‚Äôs funny for me to even say this because I was a very self-conscious person and if someone saw me doing that, I would definitely feel embarrassed and silly. Siting there crosslegged meditating like this -&gt; üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.  \n\nBut with how far I‚Äôve gotten into meditation it doesn‚Äôt bother me, hopefully the next person that sees me doing that might shed a little influence in them to do it as well. ‚ò∫Ô∏è I enjoy meditating in private but it sure does feel amazing to meditate in nature.\n\nPlease have a look at [this](https://old.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/1dkruyp/q_what_is_meditation_excerpt/) and let me know if it resonates with you.\n\nI just read it and it was definitely an interesting read. It definitely resonates. Wow\n\nüôè\n\nA 90 day intensive silent retreat. Cleared away all the crap like nothing else.\n\nWoah deets yo\n\nWhat does a day in a retreat like this look like?\n\nLearning to heal myself while doing daily tasks. It's not so much slipping into meditation at different times of the day, but more bringing some of the tools I use when meditating into my daily life. I can give to myself while doing the most mundane or complex activities.\n\nI'm happier, healthier, and more fun to be around. I have really great friends.\n\nI used to give to my \"friends\" until I'd run out of gas. It turns out this attracts the kinds of friends that aren't there for you when you need them. Now, I give generously to my friends and myself at the same time. I love my life.\n\nIf you don't mind me asking, what are some of these tools?  Grounding, etc.?  No need to go fully indepth if they can be found in your book, almost finally done reading it, i'll likely read it 2 or 3 more times, lol.  I love it.  This is Drew on my work account.\n\nIn short, it's being in a control space, which is one of the roles in the training readings at the Berkeley Psychic Institute. You stand in the back, eyes open, and grounding and running energy, blowing roses, etc. You aren't in trance the way the readers are, but you are using all of the same tools.\n\nSo same tools, but without reading the tools by being in a light trance.\n\nThe progression is described in the grounding instructions. The same progression works for running energy, protection roses, running energy, etc. It's really easy. You just need to practice the progression a week or two for it to become second nature. \n\nYou'll notice that your energy has stopped moving while you are driving and it will start running again. You'll notice you're ungrounded when you get out of your car and start grounding again. It's really fun!  This morning, on the way to the kitchen, I noticed my energy gauge was a bit low and filled in with my gold suns. It just becomes second nature.\n\nMeditation, in a way, helped me to have the discipline to become really physically fit as a young man.\n\nIn turn, I learned how to become successful in many other goals. Meditation centered me. As I was once told, it integrates one into their environment and life situations.\n\nI'm still practicing.\n\nMeditation practices that are supported by consistent Kriya Yoga and Hatha Yoga\n\nDoing The Lord's work Bulldog!\n\nNon Duality\n\nLearning the views/philosophy of Buddhism. It changed my view of the cosmic truth\n\nCare to elaborate more?\n\nI used to believe in Physicalism, but one day accidentally encountered Chogyam Trunpa Rinpoche's book Shambhala and got super interested in Buddhism. Then I took a M.A. in Religion &amp; Philosophy and started my spiritual journey since then. \n\nAfter reading extensive amount of philosophy books on different views of The Truth, I was more and more convince of the core theories of Buddhism - view of Shunyata, Karma, Impermanence etc.\n\nPsilocybin. \n\nThose 8 hours did twice as much as 8 years of therapy before that. Self hatred and suicidal ideation went away completely. Cured me of depression.\n\nSelf-administered or via medical professional out of curiosity?\n\nSelf administered with the John Hopkins playlist. I did a fair amount of research though so the set and setting was very good.\n\n4.5 grams of Golden Teachers.  I became something else - Umm maybe not ‚Äúbecame‚Äù.  But I always was and it just became obvious that I always was this something else and not who I thought I was.\n\nIn addition to meditation, Neville Goddard's teachings, The Science of Mind by Ernest Holmes, A Course in Miracles.\n\nHatha yoga and Meditation daily.  Mix of Bhakti yoga, Gian yoga, and karma yoga.  Quieting the mind and opening the heart, serving others open heartedly.  Striving to be in harmony with the universe.  Beginning to understand that everything is energy.  Your actions, your thoughts, your food, absolutely everything is energy.  Understanding that everything of form or space/time is polar.  Then putting those two concepts together and realizing that you can either move (evolve) negatively, positively, or stay stagnant.  Ultimately, your being knows every decision you make and every thought you have has a polarity to it, deep down you know what is right or wrong.  Then listening to your deep inner self and choosing the thought, or action or food etc.. that moves in the positive polarity. (You can choose the negative polarity if you like, or you can stay stagnant there is nothing wrong with that, you'll evolve regardless).  Ultimately you will get to a point where you are not choosing actions or thoughts based on right or wrong or because its the easiest but you're acting compassionately and naturally out of the harmony of the universe without a thought in your head.  There is a saying in Buddhism that states 'Out of emptiness arises compassion'.  Hope that makes sense, if it doesn't resonate with ya just leave it be.\n\nA friend of mine was adopting dogs, greyhound off the race track. They had a lot of health issues. Someone suggested she become a Reiki practitioner to help these dogs. She didn‚Äôt want to do it alone so she asked me to join her. We became Reiki Masters &amp; also became animal communicators. Those 2 training changed my life in very deep ways. It opened a new path in my life I never imagined.\n\nLSD\n\nLSD. Only taken it once. But it completely changed how I see myself in relation to the world. The sense of oneness amazing and made me think that I am a part of a whole not really an individual.\n\nSame!\n\nMeditation and volunteering for sure. \n\nLaw school definitely made me become more reasonable and understand just how unequitable our systems are. The practice of law helps me see things more objectively, which brings a peacefulness to my life. \n\nI also sustained an injury where I couldn't walk for a few months and had to do physical therapy for a year. That experience really showed me how much we need others. And just appreciating being able to get up and pee in the middle of the night.\n\nMeditating during a psilocybin trip. Hands down.\n\nInspired me to keep meditating and recontextualizing pretty much everything.\n\nFive day, two ceremony Iboga retreat. Extremely direct, aligned, powerful revelation of Truth.\n\nParenting Class- How to make your kids mind without losing yours.\n\nKarma seems to love me. Whenever I do \"dumb\" things I'm always getting a lesson soon afterwards through some sort of reversal.\n\nA month ago I was silently complaining to my gf how the person next to our table had their feet out and their feet smelled. A week later I found my feet stinking. This has never happened before!\n\nOr my girlfriend betrayed my trust (not infidelity, just medium-sized betrayal of trust) and that created a sore period for us where I was prone to distrust and anger to the point she said she was constantly afraid of doing/saying the wrong thing. And then I got swamped at work, started missing deadlines, and I experienced the same fear! I realized \"this is no way to live and I don't want to cause the person I love to feel this bad\" and so things have gotten better since then. \n\nIt has been small to medium things, never huge life-changing things, but they stack up and overall I'd say it has changed my life.\n\nPeople who treat me badly seem to get their karma too. But that's beside the point!\n\n1. Kundalini awakening during meditation - in which I had powerful visions and felt a powerful vibration all through my body\n2. Communicating with my higher self\n3. The concept of time dissolving and living in consciousness, energy, vibration and frequencies\n\nEated mushrooms.\n\nWhat belief of yours was broken by experiencing that animal instinct?\n\nI quit niccotine vaping, and my brain didn't produce happiness chemicals right for months.  I have a lot of things I do in order to feel productive and accomplished, so not only was I not happy, but I also felt worthless and non-productive.\n\nIn order to combat this, I created a get-through-it program for myself using a monthly planner and a habit tracker.\n\nI would complete my habit tracker throughout the day as I completed tasks, or \"daily's,\" then at the end of the day I would use the monthly planner as a journal for all the things I had done, down to the hour of my day.\n\nIt really showed me how much you can get done in an hour, in a day, and your results and notes over the course of a month or a year.  It is the record log of your life, and paired together with a habit tracker it does not give you the option to slack off or fail unless you drop off the program entirely.\n\nIt's the best show of personal determination, organization, and forward progress toward the things you want to be good at.\n\n\n\nIn addition to yoga your yoga practice, I would encourage you to look up the yamas and niyamas, as well as different types of yoga so you can really start to look at the depth of what is there beyond just Asana and Hatha Yoga.  If you are getting licensed as a 2 hour yoga therapist, I would also recommend the book, \"How to Know God, the Yoga Aphorisms of Patanjali.\"  Beyond that, meditation in the form of concentration (mantra) practices, and emptiness practices.  \n\nSorry for dumping.  PM me if you have questions.\n\nvipassana\n\nRaelian seminars, daily meditation, and Tao Te Ching have all been pretty crucial for me.\n\nAsking myself ‚ÄúWhat will my future self wish he did?‚Äù led to a cascade of internal growth which abolished 90% of my self doubt and self judgment. The answer to that question was ‚ÄúMaybe my future self will wish he wasn‚Äôt so hard on himself his whole life.‚Äù\n\nAlcoholics Anonymous, meditation, The Four Agreements.¬†\n\nCould you tell more about your near death experience?\n\nMine was inner engineering for sure.\n\nRebirthing - holotropic breathing.

I was highly skeptical of acupuncture but my doctor couldn't get me in for two months.   \n  \nMy acupuncturist, knowing that this was my 1st experience, gave me a minimum of needles. He gave me needles along the meridian to support my liver and digestion. I was confused when he told me to take off my watch and my hearing aids, but he explained since we are working with my energy (blockages or reducing energy along the meridians). He lowered the lights and told me to sleep, if I could. I didn't think I would sleep but I did and woke up to the sounds of birds. I was confused as to why these birds were so loud, thinking that it was springtime and maybe the birds outside the building were in mating season.\n\nWhen he came in to take the needles out, I put my watch back on and my hearing aids. Driving home, I was amazed at how loose my neck was (I didn't even realize it was stiff because I was not in pain). I slept better than I had slept in years. I woke up to no pain in my lower back, no pain in my right hip, and my hearing was better. \n\nWhen I saw him a few days later for my 2nd treatment, I told him about everything. I also told him with my hearing aids in (for my 1st treatment) I couldn't hear the nature loop, but with my hearing aids out, I was able to hear the birds in the nature loop, as if my hearing \"turned on\". He told me, \"Oh I didn't even give you needles for that!\"\n\nIt was amazing how much was affected on my body by my first acupuncture treatment. I have plenty of friends where they experienced no difference after acupuncture. Every session I have had of acupuncture has helped my hearing, and reduced or removed almost all my aches and pains. Unfortunately the affect leaves my body within days.\n\nwow, that's intense and really powerful. for me, yoga and meditation \"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRShr6RqxNc&amp;list=PL4lrrX1axdp4wXjGOR76tCl9tpe6kilYC&amp;pp=iAQB](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRShr6RqxNc&amp;list=PL4lrrX1axdp4wXjGOR76tCl9tpe6kilYC&amp;pp=iAQB)\" have been game-changers. they‚Äôve helped me find balance and peace. volunteering has also opened my eyes to so many perspectives and brought so much joy.  \n  \ndid u know regular yoga practice can boost your immune system? what has been the biggest lesson you've learned from your experiences?\n\nReality transsurfing which I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôd derived from the fourth way.

Haha\n\nThere's the obvious community and volunteering benefits, but there's other huge benefits, like pure hope and optimism for the future. The belief that everything is going to be okay and turn out well. Practicing love and giving up control. Theology is so fun to learn about as well!\n\nLetting Jesus comfort me‚Ä¶"

    "title": "60 Days of meditation streak. My experience",
    "body": "Hey everyone,\n\nI wanted to share my journey after completing a 60-day meditation streak‚Äîthe longest I've ever managed. I‚Äôve been meditating on and off since 2021, trying various techniques, but always struggled to stay consistent. This time, I‚Äôve managed to stick with it, and I wanted to reflect on what I've learned, struggled with, and where I‚Äôm headed.\n\n**Background:** I‚Äôve experimented with many forms of meditation over the years. I‚Äôve tried different apps, different styles‚Äîguided, unguided, long sessions, short bursts‚Äîyou name it. I kept quitting for various reasons, often getting frustrated with myself. But for the last two months, I‚Äôve committed to a simple routine: 10 minutes in the morning (with a bit of gratitude practice) and 10 minutes at night (followed by some self-compassion using a custom mantra).\n\n**Month 1:** The first month was all about habit-building. Once I hit around the 30-day mark, meditation became something I did almost unconsciously‚ÄîI started to miss it if I skipped a session. For beginners, I‚Äôd recommend sticking to 10 minutes per session as it‚Äôs manageable and helps cement the habit.\n\nI noticed that I felt a bit calmer immediately after meditating, and occasionally, I remembered to focus on my breath during the day, which helped me stay grounded. But there were frustrating moments too, especially when I was agitated. On those days, I switched things up with different techniques like guided meditation, gratitude, or self-compassion practices.\n\nOne thing I realized is that reading or studying about meditation doesn‚Äôt work for me unless it's purely for inspiration. The real progress comes from practice. Little by little, I started identifying what worked best for me, particularly techniques that helped me avoid getting too attached to my thoughts.\n\n**Month 2:** The second month deepened my practice. I stuck to the same routine but focused more on counting breaths and staying mindful of the present moment. I‚Äôve come to see meditation as just one piece of a larger puzzle‚Äîit‚Äôs about incorporating mindfulness into daily life, not just during those 10-minute sessions.\n\nOne significant shift has been in how I handle hard emotions. Thanks to meditation, I‚Äôm more aware when I‚Äôm angry or stuck in thought loops, and I can usually pull myself back to the present by focusing on my breath. This awareness has been a game-changer for me.\n\nI also found it helpful to create a daily task list and schedule, sorting tasks by priority (1-3). This helps me avoid procrastination and spending time on things that don‚Äôt really matter. Meditation is a ‚Äú1,‚Äù cleaning the room is a ‚Äú2,‚Äù and downloading a movie is a ‚Äú3.‚Äù It‚Äôs a small thing, but it keeps me focused and mindful throughout the day.\n\nHowever, it‚Äôs not all smooth sailing. Even now, my mind sometimes races during meditation. But I‚Äôve learned that the goal isn‚Äôt to clear my mind‚Äîit's to acknowledge that these thoughts exist and recognize that clinging to them doesn‚Äôt help.\n\n**Important Lesson:** I went on holiday for three days and barely meditated for three minutes each day. I noticed that this short break nearly derailed my entire meditation practice. It was a wake-up call‚Äîdon‚Äôt skip any day, even if it‚Äôs just a few minutes! Consistency is key, and taking even a small break can make it much harder to get back on track.\n\n**Conclusion:** After two months, I can say that meditation has become an integral part of my daily routine. While I still struggle with restlessness and a whirlwind of thoughts (possible ADHD doesn‚Äôt help), the benefits are clear. I‚Äôm more present, better at handling negative emotions, and have a more structured approach to my day.\n\nIf you‚Äôre struggling to meditate consistently, my advice is to keep it simple, don‚Äôt stress about the perfect technique, and just keep showing up. It‚Äôs a journey, and every session, even the tough ones, adds value.\n\nLooking forward to seeing where the next 60 days take me!",

    "all_comment_text": "First of all, if you can, it is worth introducing the practice into your daily life. You can do this by, for example, asking yourself questions to interest your consciousness, for example:\n\nWhat am I doing now?\n\nWhat is the mind doing?\n\nWhat am I aware of?\n\nWhat is my attitude (I mean the attitude towards the experience)?\n\nOr you can simply gently direct your attention to any of the most obvious experiences or sensations in the body.\n\nBut when integrating the practice into your daily life, you don't have to focus on concentrating or anything like that. It's more about reminding yourself to be aware and noticing. For example, when you sit in a chair, you can notice sensations in your buttocks related to sitting, some sounds in the background etc. You can also notice what your attitude is towards what you are experiencing, whether you notice growing pleasure, desire, or maybe you notice aversion and reluctance, unpleasant sensations, or maybe you don't know what your attitude is.\n\nThis type of noticing does not require a lot of energy and can be done in a relaxed way so you do not have to exert yourself too much and it is easy to stay conscious for longer, not just for 10 minutes.\n\nI am doing this practice you are describing every day in almost all situations. I started this for some months and it grows and grows very quickly. my anxiety is gone and I feel every moment very intensive and I'm so thankful for this.\nI never get into the routine of meditation and was always asking myself if it is a must to do. Are there any other benefits of meditation that it is worth to start with?\n\nSorry for my english.\n\nMeditation has changed my life. I have been meditating daily for close to 4 years now. I feel so much more grounded and calm. It really is life changing if you stick with it.\n\nHow to start? I have tried it but for some reason couldn't stick to it.\nWhat's the best way according to you?\n\nUse an app. I use medito, use the daily, and stick with the streak\n\nI used to do that. I'm not new to meditation. There's also another app called \"Balance\", which gives you a 1 year free subscription. It's better than medito. But, the problem is I find it hard to stick to an app. I want a simple routine something that I can do on my own.\n\nYou learn it as you learn everything else. Sitting down and doing it. Learning to observe is always the key skill and you can use apps or personal routines to come to that place of observation.   \n  \nA simple routine would be step by step: sit down, feel the surrounding, feel the body, feel the breath and then focus on the breath while observing upcoming thoughts and emotions. If you catch yourself following a thought for too long, celebrate the moment of clarity instead of judging yourself for \"again\" losing the focus. The positive reinforcement sends your brain the signal to repeat a pattern, which is catching yourself in the thinking mode followed by clarity.\n\nWill do üëçüèΩ. Thanks\n\nIt is a matter of discipline, patience and among other capacities such as self-control or emotional self-regulation, meditating is really complicated and it is not something that everyone can do as if nothing had happened the first time practicing, if you develop these capacities you will improve your meditation and simultaneously if You meditate, you improve those abilities.\nIt really is a fascinating practice that you should implement in your routine because it can change your life.\nAnd at first I couldn't meditate for even 5 minutes because it stressed me out and now I meditate for 2 hours straight without much problem and my life feels much better now.\n\nSomething I have noticed is that when I started, meditating was something that stressed me out a lot and irritated me mentally but now I see it as a pleasant and relaxing practice.\n\n&gt; One significant shift has been in how I handle hard emotions. Thanks to meditation, I‚Äôm more aware when I‚Äôm angry or stuck in thought loops, and I can usually pull myself back to the present by focusing on my breath. This awareness has been a game-changer for me.  \n\nI often read something like the text that I've quoted when when I read  about meditation and its positive sides.  \nTo me this is the most frustrating part, because when I realize that I'm scared, frustrated, angry, desperate I immediately know that I need to do something to harness these feelings; I need to make choices about my life, enhance my courage, build the capacity to confront people when necessary, and a lot of other things that are the crux of the matter and the source of my pain. Thus, when I meditate, suddenly painful truths manifest in front at the eyes of my mind and I realize that there are parts of my life that I cannot (that I am not able)  change and I'm immediately flooded by feelings of deep despondency and desolation. It's awful.\nWhat I am talking about are not just thoughts, illusion of the mind, but truths, condition in which my life is.   \n\nI hope you can understand what I'm saying, English as you can argue is not my mother tongue.\n\nThis is a very important realization. Meditation allows you to calm your mind so the important stuff becomes more apparent, but what meditation doesn't do is allow you to solve your own problems. It simply shows you want you can and can't change.\nIt reminds me of the serenity prayer (I'm not religious, I view it as a stoic mantra): \"Grant me the courage to change that which is in my control, the serenity to accept that which is not, and the wisdom to know the difference\".\n\nThanks for the answer. I know the \"prayer\", but is one's own life is unchangeable, thus it is a tragedy. And I guess everyone's here who practice meditation hopes to change (for the better) his her own life.\n\nDo you use your tongue to touch top of the roof of mouth while inhaling before exhaling out mouth ? Do it make a huge difference \n\nDo you breath in through stomach ( stomach expands on inhale) or do you breath from chest and mouth ?\n\nCongratulations! This sounds like a wonderful experience\n\nif u read this oo please look up books about zen practice/buddhist practice in meditation. You will love it i think\n\nRemind me 2 hours\n\nHow to observe breath without controlling it. The meditation apps say to do that after a few deep breaths. But it's hard, nearly impossible, for me to do that. Any suggestions?\n\nWhat actually is required to do like just focusing on the breaths or something else ????\n\nThank you for sharing\n\nJust joined the community after a notification popped up. I need to start meditating n working on how I handle my anxiety\n\nWhat changes did you notice after 56 days? Did you notice something different on day 57?\n\nI‚Äôd say meditate at least for 30 mins per session if you really want benefits"

I do 10 mins every night right before bed and just count my breaths. \n\nI try to pay close attention to the sound and feeling of the air entering and leaving my nose and count every exhale. It took some trial and error. \n\nI‚Äôve gone from using a mantra, to focusing on the sensations of my body, to visualization, but the breath counting seems to be helping the most. I‚Äôve noticed a big difference in my day to day life. \n\nMy thoughts have become far and few in between. Before my inner monologue was very loud and domineering. Now I feel like I gave myself a lobotomy without the commitment lol\n\nI feel peaceful and I‚Äôll sit by myself or in the car happily focusing on my music and surroundings and notice ‚Äúwow I‚Äôm not even thinking about anything‚Äù. \n\nIt‚Äôs truly life changing and I implore anyone who is suffering to use this practice when they feel stable and ready. There‚Äôs a reason meditation is big time encouraged for mental illness and they‚Äôre not kidding. \n\nIt‚Äôs worth it. \n\nI now prioritize meditation every evening like a pill I have to take everyday. I‚Äôve also been noticing very bizarre and vivid dreams. \n\nI‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs a side effect of meditation - like maybe with my mind being so quiet during the day, it all comes out in my dreams.

I also want to form the habit, but for some reason I always back out in the last minute and not able to prioritize meditation.\n\nBut congratulations to you, thanks for the insipiration.ü•Ç\n\nwhat helped me the most was attending in-person meditation sessions on Sundays in my local Buddhist temple. It sets me nicely for the week ahead. Highly recommended if you have the opportunity.\n\nI start my day with 10 mins of guided meditation. It‚Äôs the first thing I do (still laying in bed). It sets the tone for my day. It‚Äôs been a habit for a good few years now and It has definitely bought calmness and feelings of being grounded to my life.\n\nDo you use any app for the guided meditation?\n\nInsight Timer. This year I‚Äôve been using Chopra / Patience - but I‚Äôm not renewing after the year is up as it feels like they‚Äôre light on content. I‚Äôve also used Calm and Headspace, but inevitably always end up back with Insight Timer.\n\nDo you go on a yoga mat or do it in bed before going to sleep? Finding a comfortable routine place was the hardest part about it for me. Glad to hear it s changing your life for the better!\n\nFor me - I do it in my computer chair (which is premium, comfortable and encourages good posture) and face my closet doors.\n\nA quality computer chair sounds like a great idea!\n\nI lay in bed under the covers or sit on the couch. I‚Äôve always found it difficult to do the cross legged sitting position. It‚Äôs super hard to maintain a straight posture for me.\n\n‚ò∫Ô∏è\n\nThat lobotomy without the commitment part made me laugh because I totally get it. It‚Äôs like turning down the volume on life.\n\nI have been struggling with the breath count method. I cycle through 1 through 10 for each exhale and inhale. However I loose the counter sometimes and find myself wondering out. Can you help with your counting techniq? So do you go for largest number or break it for repeatation? Might sound stupid question but got to ask.\n\nThe breath count didn‚Äôt work for me at first so I just used a mantra until I got used to being quiet and still. Actually the breath count made me feel like my heart was beating too fast. I think you should try a different method first until you‚Äôre comfortable. I‚Äôm only able to do the breath count now after a couple weeks of using a mantra and visualization\n\n3 months and a life time to\nGo ¬†stay ttanquil, and emotionally intelligent fiends¬†\n\nI love this.

    "all_comment_text": "Accepting resistance dissolves resistance.\n\nYes, and:\n\nFighting resistance increases resistance.\n\nAccepting the resistance can not be used as a positive assertion to realize. Acceptance has to happen, where the mind is adamant, where it is not accepting, where it is escaping the uneasiness of the moment psychologically. Here the negative meets the positive; the zero ground is suddenly realized.\n\nhow do you do that?\n\nAccept the feeling of discomfort. Don't fight it. Allow it in and sink into the strain. When you do, you will notice the feeling dissipating from 'discomfort' into 'comfort.' At the end of the day it is just a feeling and our rejection to it is what makes it negative/uncomftorable. \n\nI tend to do this by anticipating resistance when I meditation. So sometimes (mostly when I am stressed), as soon as I start meditating, I open my mind to accept discomfort/strain/negativity. At first, resistance may take a while to appear since I am already in a state of embracing it, and my mind is looking for it. But eventually, it tends to come. Because my mind is set on accepting resistance, I can quickly sink into it, dissolve it, and enter a deeper state of meditation.\n\nThis might be a little tough to master though as for many of us, resistance is rather heavy and embracing it can be rather harrowing. But considering I also exercise and lean into the strain in exercise, take cold showers and surrender to the strain from cold water and practice pranayama and lean into the strain when holding my breath... I have worked hard on fine tuning my mind to accepting discomfort/strain rather than automatically rejecting/fighting it. Now, I've been getting to a point where my mind automatically accepts strain in a way that helps me be at peace most of the time, even under stressful situations. (Unless it's an argument with the wife. That's taking me a longer time to master lol)\n\nAll that said, I don't think you need to do all those practices either to be able to accept resistance during meditation. They just make it easier.\n\nLabeling can help. \n\nWhen you finally realize you are in a certain state, label it, you will recognize them much quicker. Once you recognize them, put your pinpointed focus on the location in the body where the feeling is coming from (which takes some training), most often the feeling will vanish. \n\nIf it returns, ignore it until it demands your attention, and then pinpoint it again. This is when you will discover what memory or emotion the feeling is tied to. \n\nNew insights and perspectives will flow into your mind allowing you to process the trapped emotions.\n\nNice! Very cool insight.\n\nThank you. very good advice!\n\nYes. Our normal state is always trying to make ourselves more comfortable. Following our preferences obsessively. Unable to withstand the slightest discomfort. Essentially this is what Buddhism calls clinging. Learning to be OK being uncomfortable, relaxing your preferences, learning to let go of the requirement that things be just as you want them to be - this leads to freedom.\n\nNice.\n\n+1\n\nThis was good to read. thank you for sharing. I'll try and remember this the next time I need it :)\n\nThis is an extremely narrow definition of meditation that I simply can't get behind. There's nothing at all explained about why this is the case and this is not a feature of most meditation. An opinion is only as good as the information you use to support it with, and there's none here, just declarations and unconnected one's at that.\n\n  \nI meditate in too many different ways for this to have anything to do with my practice, or many others for that matter. The idea that there is 'a truth to existence' is a human delusion, so you're running with some feelings here that aren't really reflective of meditation as it's actually practiced.\n\nI see posts like this in here all the time, a few flowery psuedo poetic turns of phrase and then absolutely no ability of any kind to expand on the thought and fully express it in a clear and unambiguous way.\n\nWhy do you feel the need to redefine meditation to this narrow level and cast it to the Internet as if it's sage advice? It's very blind to any understanding of meditation as it's practiced today and throughout history.\n\nWhile sitting with discomfort is definitely a form of meditation, it is only one in a massive encylopedia of methods, and the sooner you get your mind away from this concept of there being fundamental truths out there the better. That will cripple your growth and understanding of the world in ways you can never imagine because you will be chained inside a definition of your own creation, a comfortable illusion, but an illusion none the less.\n\nThere's a whole lot more out there to know about than you've settled on here even if we can't talk about fundamental truths, it doesn't matter, we can create our own context, so long as it doesn't go against observational reality, which this does.\n\nYou need to look more, there's a lot you're missing.\n\n Exactly. There is also a place for meditation when you're in a blissful state. So you can not just get swayed by the Delightfulness, but you still stay aware. This is also the skill that you need to cultivate. not just adapting this mentality when it's going to be some sort of David Goggins, mental gymnastics, where you need to suffer all the time. Meditation is ups and downs, and downs, and ups, and it's true that it might be more difficult, and unpleasant moments. but it doesn't have to be only this way.\n\nGreat addition, thank you. There's are traps of thought for sure. Spotting yourself in one can be a little tricky.\n\nThat this isn't helpful for you, doesn't mean it's helpful for no one. Elements of your comment strike me as self-righteous.\n\nThe definition is helpful to no one. It is flatly wrong. \nAnyone that thinks that is what meditation is closing the door to the bulk of what the rest of the world practices. \n\nDoes the text they wrote actually resonate with you? \n\nI know a way you can check. \n\nEngage with the OP with polite conversation simply asking for them to expand on what they're saying and see how it matches to with how you perceived what they meant it.\n\nHave a conversation instead of using the Internet as a soap box. I'm willing to update my views if you can provide compelling non emotionally based responses where the words together are actually related in way you can point to. \n\nI'm not sure why you think this is self righteous? I get things wrong too. I correct or I explain it and move on. \n\nThis isn't self righteousness. I'm not sure why you think that? I'm simply asking for clarification and coherent statements. \n\nThese statements are neither coherent nor do most of the statements even concern the same thing.\n\nIf you can explain anything the OP meant in the context as you understand it I would be very interested in hearing it. \n\nAll I want is a bare bones basic attempt at people to actually communicate and explain to each other rather than throwing around claims of self righteousness and emotionally based arguments. This is as meditation group we can do better than that and I assure you there is no emotion in my words simple language using well defined words to query someone's beliefs to see where they come from.\n\nWrong is wrong, I'm sometimes wrong. I correct it and move on. I explain. \n\nThat's not happening here.\n\nMaybe it only applies to one aspect of meditation, but I do find it useful for relaxing and removing anxiety\n\nWhat they are talking about is¬† true...I experienced abuse in many forms as a child...I have been trying to spiritually evolve for the last 3 years ever since my Ma passed away...it has definitely been an adventure into my inner self...I have very little memories of childhood...I also experience numerous synchrocronocities on a daily basis...my intuition is strong and pulls me to be aware of things in my environment...I have started my journey with my numb and unpresent feelings which are hard to label but 2 days ago I started feeling heat throughout my body then extreme nausea followed by strong head pressure and pain...I had no idea what this was...my body would not releave me of this...it lasted at least six hours on the first day and the second day about three until I started verbally expressing my thoughts on it along with questions out into the Universe hoping to hit the nail on the head..then something happened that was so confusing and has never happened before..I have always been a negative thinker about myself and life in general..the negative thoughts in my head were being denied by incoming thoughts as to why they were not true..I usually fall into the fear believing it..not neutralizing it..then when I woke up this morning I came across this conversation as if being led to an answer to the day before questions!?!¬† I am getting the feelings that I experienced as a child while being abused..I'm Healing!!¬† Your body knows what your head doesn't..and I believe this gift is given to us in our awareness in order for us to be set free...our creator knows what he's doing..on the other side of fear is Freedom and Happiness üòÅ\n\nI read your post, and can not understand how anything you wrote has anything to do with what the OP said here.\n\nNothing you spoke to me in any way helps explain how what you're saying is explaining how what the OP said is actually coherent in any way. You just described your personal experience and in no way connected it with the OP's comment or anything I said.\n\n  \nSo I honestly don't know how to respond beyond that.\n\nThis post is actually not only about the sit down cross your legs type of meditation...there are many forms of consciousness such as in meditation..I believe the form mentioned here may be about healing unhealthy thought processes or stored trauma in the body such as pain or fear that has not been dealt with that have been brought on by most¬† traumas/abuse/neglect which can have numerous symptoms in your mind as negative thinking, triggers, pain, numbness, etc.felt in the body that pose a real threat even if the incident happened 30 years ago and if not healed when it starts affecting your soul it can feel like all hope is lost and can bring with it suicidal thoughts..your thoughts come by way of your consciousness..changing negative thoughts to positive ones neutralizes this way of thinking \"Meditation has happened\" you are now in a fused state...\n\nNothing you wrote is connected in any way to what I wrote. Where did you get this reply from? It is so disconnected from anything I said. \n\nI know meditation is not only about the sit down style. I never said anything to suggest otherwise why you started with that is weird. \n\nDid you get cross threaded? \n\n\nNothing is stored in the body. Any sensation you feel in the body exists only in your mind and any memory it triggers is in the mind not the body. \n\nYou're being tricked by some illusion of the mind of you think memory is actually in the body. \n\nNothing you said actually still makes any sense in this greater context of meditation you describe. It's not coherent.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier there are other forms of consciousness outside of meditation such as when you were mentioning, \"be comfortable with this uncomfortableness\"..I explained this in my first comment as I experience this form of consciousness all the time..it has to do with, experiencing trauma, it deals with certain people who experience certain trauma.. plays out mentally with their mental health especially when they are healing, at least I do this, I explained this form above in my first reply..I am sorry if it's confusing you in the way I explained it..the way that you were responding with your original post made me recall an experience with consciousness that I experienced which would be in the same context as your original post..You will find this fact expanding all over therapeutic advice and help for people experiencing PTSD brought on by some forms of trauma..some trauma is so terrifying that the brain can not file and sort it correctly so cannot file it the same way as other traumas..violent traumas go by way of the hypothalamus and autonomic ammune system so instead the violent types of trauma stores itself somewhere in the body and it appears over and over in the persons body and life as unexplained pain¬† then shows up as other different unexplained symptoms, sometimes with forgotten trauma memories stored as pain in the body..I know what I'm talking about..when medical people look for the patient's pain they find no proof to its cause..it is because this is stored trauma showing up and trauma needs to be recognized in order for this person and their pain to heal..it is a fact that I am experiencing this form of trauma in my life at this very time along with many other symptoms dealing with mental health..I am neither crazy or illutional..you may not believe it is exactly about what you posted but my experience is..I am only explaining another form of consciousness..maybe I would make a excellent patient for scientific research..sorry to have confused you¬†\n\nThere are other forms of conciousness outside meditation?\n\nNot a good one to start with.\n\nWhen I said be comfortable with uncomfortableness that has nothing to do with consciousness outside of meditation, that's not a coherent response. I don't even know what you could mean there.\n\nI know what you've said but not one single word of it is connected to anything that I said. Whatever it is you believe it is not compatible with my observed reality.\n\nYou're discussing mental illness and metaphysical beliefs in your post and you're repeating the same non-relevent information since the begging of this post with no actual true explanation.\n\nNothing you've written has done anything at all to unconfuse me because I still have no idea at all how you think anything you wrote is connected to what I said.\n\nI was thinking on a better way to explain what I meant because I went back and reread my replies to you..and it may have been clear to me..I see why you may have been confused, so sorry..bare with me and I'll explain as best I can..I experienced extreme trauma very young..emotional and physical neglect among others which somehow caused memory loss but in its place caused me thoughts of unworthiness, negativity towards my life, lack of¬† thoughts about myself along with projections of negativity out into the world and because it was obvious to me the lack of fairness in our world..these thoughts were extremely hard to reverse, to turn them around to positive ones..there was much fear involved....I've been trying to evolve as a person most of my life until three years ago when my Ma passed away then suddenly I felt a strong urge to progress spiritually, mind, body, and soul..along with using prayer, meditation, singing, and listening to music..a person can experience another form of consciousness while singing and getting caught up in it..time can slow down..I've done this many times while also trying to manifest good things into my life at the same time..a few days before I read your post, those negative thoughts I mentioned above, were all of a sudden (in my head without effort) changing while I was experiencing them and being replaced with reasons why they were not true about me..this has never happened before and I couldn't even explain the joy that happened in my soul...I always have extensive conversations with the Universe especially when experiencing growth which is much better then any other thing I practice spiritually.¬† ¬†I have worked hard up to this point..I hardly ever over think anymore, my ego is slowly fading, I feel peace in my being, and I feel, on most occasions, compassion towards others..so you see there can be other forms of consciousness..thank you for putting up with my long replies..\n\nThank you for the response, I am glad you have found this.\n\nThank you, more than anything I hope it can help you and/or others in some way..your patience was much appreciated¬†\n\n'Discomfort' might be the word you are looking for.\n\nMy neck hurts due to poor sleep, few days, the pain, it has been occuring. Thanks to almost a year of practicing meditation to handle stress and discomforts, whenever neck pain triggered, I don't easily get stressed by it unlike the before I practice meditation.\n\n[deleted]\n\n&gt; Sitting in a calm place, in a relaxed position, listening to some music that's comforting and easy on the ears to meditate is not meditation. The goal of meditation is to find stability wherever you are.\n\nIt's probably best to avoid the trap of thinking that you know the one true meditation type and \"the meditation people follow is so overrated.\"\n\nWhile there are surely activities people pass off as \"meditation\" that don't produce the results of meditation, there's also credible research that shows decreased default mode network activity in meditators doing very different meditation types. \n\nDecreased activity of the default mode network appears to lead to a lot of the reported benefits of meditation: decreased rumination, decreased negative, self-related feelings, etc.\n\n* https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22114193/\n* https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4529365/\n\n[deleted]\n\nI didn't downvote, fwiw.\n\n&gt; The system I follow is based on Praanayama, not some pseudo-scientific mumbo-jumbo. India never promoted spirituality as a science, rather an experience one should go through in its purest form without the influence of an external factor. I am an expert in Praanayama, ask me anything and I'll give you an answer, but don't ever say it's a trap. \n\nThat's not at all what I wrote. Here it is again:\n\n&gt; It's probably best to avoid the trap of thinking that you know **the one true meditation type** and \"the meditation people follow is so overrated.\"\n\nYou said:\n\n&gt; India never promoted spirituality as a science, rather an experience one should go through in its purest form without the influence of an external factor.\n\nIf that's your point of view, then ok. I think meditation is a human activity not restricted to Indians or India however, so I don't really understand why India has any more relevance here than e.g., Estonia or Ghana.\n\n&gt; What do you mean credible research? Who are these people? \n\nIf you're actually interested, all you need to do is follow the links to the publications. The authors' names are associated with their publication history. And you can see other papers that cite the research. You can decide if they're credible to you.\n\nBut I have the feeling that you won't be convinced by scientific findings. That's fine. To each their own.\n\n&gt; Can they practically apply meditation as a practice and get a definitive result? What if I say I can? What do you want to bet on it?\n\nNothing. If you get something out of meditation, then that's great. But that's neither unique to you or unique to your particular practice.\n\nPeople have practices that differ from yours. Science seems to show that many different meditation practices lead to similar, beneficial outcomes.\n\nThat's my point.\n\nI think his point was science is science, but this is his idea of building his world that works for him, i think everyone is speaking from their ego here‚Ä¶ honestly yall are fighting over who is right and who is wrong.\n\n&gt; I think his point was science is science, but this is his idea of building his world that works for him\n\nSure. No problem there.\n\nJust to clarify then, it's fine by me if the parent wants to do their practice. If you read back through the thread, I tried to say so.\n\nWhat I found less than helpful to others here ‚Äì and my reason for commenting originally ‚Äì is that the parent was putting down other peoples' preferred ways to meditate, like meditating in a calm, quiet environment.\n\nI thought bringing up science that shows that various meditation techniques have similar observable effects would be evidence to the parent that maybe they should open up a little. The parent wasn't convinced. That's ok. Different people respond to different things.\n\n&gt; i think everyone is speaking from their ego here‚Ä¶ honestly yall are fighting over who is right and who is wrong.\n\nSorry it came across that way to you.\n\nMeditation absolutely is not a subset of pranayama by any metric. What makes you say that?\n\nIndia did and still does promote spirituality as a science. Yogis attaining a particular goal through particular experiments is science.\n\nYour very response looks as ego filled as you would expect from a new age beginner who likes to be hostile to strangers when it wasn't called for. With your \"Who cares about ancient wisdom or what the whole world does, my system is the best and i am an expert.\" I have to wonder if it's because you really are the person you portray in the comment, or it's because you're trying to sell something or just want to feel good about yourself on the internet.\n\nBut you know what i'll bite. Do tell us your definition of meditation. What your system is and how it completely differs from other systems from everyone else which you define as overrated, hyped versions of narcissism.\n\n[deleted]\n\nMetric here is simply a way of measurement. That part wasn't important. Not sure why you're asking me to define all these things.\n\nYes i am from india. I practice kriya pranayama, as part of my kriya yoga practice from about 4 years. My teachers separate meditation from pranayama and do not claim a relation.\n\nScience is a systematic study with experiments following a methodology based on evidence.\n\nGoals can be anything from the tiny things like attaining piti or stream entry to the big one, full awakening. Any experiment to attain these goals based on available knowledge, simple trial and error, could be considered part of the scientific method.\n\nI wont be wasting more time with useless answers to your dozen questions when you never answered mine. I think you are selling your programs from your website which is why you pose as an expert. Or you like to go against the grain to claim you know a secret system that nobody else knows to feel good. I don't know if these are true, just the only explanations i could think of for your aggressive response. I said you seemed hostile as the person you replied to wasn't rude to you, but you were rude to him.\n\nWhy don't you simply put your money where your mouth is and explain what your system is and how it differs from other systems that you criticised? It won't take you a long time, and would make people consider that maybe you're not an imposter and are worth taking seriously. If whatever you claim is true, don't you want to help people learn what you know?\n\n[deleted]\n\nMy god man if you really have 30 years of experience and you still talk like this so full of ego, then your practice must be completely shit.\n\nAnd no i am not arguing because of my 4 years of experience, the experience of my lineage and the tradition of kriya yoga is what goes against you.\n\nKeep trying to be an attention seeker on the internet. Isn't it funny that a 30 year \"expert\" still doesn't want to actually tell us what this system is and sticks to talking shit about others and praising himself? That tells everyone what they need to know. Have you wondered why you're being downvoted to hell and all your comments and are being seen negatively even apart from this one?\n\n[deleted]\n\nYeah we are. Who wants to talk to an \"expert\" who's full of themselves?\n\nhttps://deep-psychology.com/the-spiritual-ego/\n\nYou can not come out of thinking and discuss 'about' thinking.  (when you say-‚ÄòI am thinking‚Äô, this itself is thinking and not the source of thinking).  \n[https://www.quora.com/Where-is-the-source-origin-of-thoughts-How-do-they-develop-How-do-they-reach-the-mind/answer/Y-V-Chawla-1](https://www.quora.com/Where-is-the-source-origin-of-thoughts-How-do-they-develop-How-do-they-reach-the-mind/answer/Y-V-Chawla-1)\n\n[deleted]\n\nScience investigates the outer phenomenon. Here the investigating mind itself becomes a matter of investigation.\n\nThis totally make sense to me. Meditation for me is about action, because as a human im always in action, moving getting up, sleeping, walking, thinking watching, so for me it‚Äôs important in this human experience to be able to naturally be in a meditative state to feel like i feel ground to earth while being a spirit that flies too high sometimes\n\nI find it very uncomfortable to not move my body at all. Like how can someone stay completely still for hours?\n\nsame!! I start to notice my right shoulder pain and lower back discomfort, then my rest wants to stand and do a dance\n\nYou can meditate while moving as well. Sitting meditation just helps develop the mechanism that allows you to be present at other times\n\nedit: and also if you reach a jhana while doing sitting meditation the pain vanishes\n\nThe ability to remain still for lengths of time develops as meditation progresses, especially as you enter states of pleasure. It becomes comfortable. It's a side-effect and for those used to sitting for longer periods of time, it actually takes an act of will to move.\n\nI like the statement and agree with it. Be comfortable when uncomfortable.\n\nWhat if the acute physical pain and discomfort is a physical manifestation of psychological discomfort?\n\nWhat is a 'fused state'?\n\nJust see the point:  \nIn the moments of physical danger, there is no time to talk, think, discuss-even to think ‚Äòwhy it happened‚Äô. The whole energy is concentrated in saving oneself from danger. There is intensity and alertness in action. In other (psychologically) disturbing situations (loss, defame, disease, relationship problems and so on), we are carried away as if this situation should not be there, we are embroiled in ‚Äòwhy and how‚Äô of the situation instead of concentrating on action (or no-action) as in the moments of physical danger.\n\nIn fact, when we are not embroiled in ‚Äòwhy and how‚Äô, the whole energy ¬†is concentrated-action (or no-action) arises automatically. ‚ÄòWhat you want‚Äô becomes clear.\n\nI think you are describing impartial being attention, which is different than ordinary headbrain attention. In meditation there is no you. We have \"I 's\" that take us to where meditation is possible then get out of the way.¬†\n\n\nImpartial attention is key.\n\n\n\nStillness that doesn't require a lack of movement. Silence that doesn't require a lack of sound . Spaciousness, ones real mind. This is ones true nature. The personality passive and the essential being active.¬†\n\n\nIf there is a you, an identification , that's ok, just become aware of that and come back to impartial being attention on all sensation and direct perception.\n\n\nAll memories of being present are illusion constructed by the personality, so do not grasp at experiences of presence. When you say I am present you have already bounced out of direct perception into an identification. Only presence knows when it is present.\n\n\nAttention and presence are the only tools of the essential being to awaken the human biological machine to fulfill its true function as a transformational apparatus upon the eternal essential being.\n\n\nAttention is a mild cleansing radiation that can act as a catalyst, transforming energy. Place attention on all sensations including discomfort and relax.¬† Releases will occur as attention penetrates.¬† And when it is clear one slides into the waking state and presence present in the present.\nPain is worked with differently. One can diffuse the pain over the whole body until it wakes up the machine. Once the essential being remembers it's true relationship to the machine, it heals the imbalance or block.\nPeace be with you dear friend¬†\n\nIssue of Meditation, mindfulness arises as one feels pain and uncertainty in daily life. Any practice or tool gives relief from the uneasiness one is experiencing. Unless the uneasiness, the discomfort is absorbed without any explanation - one may become addicted to escapes.\n\nWhen we see this fact clearly, fused state may touch. Now you are in meditation 24x7.\n\nI get the impression that you are sweeping away all psychological discomfort as... fake? I can't get behind that.\n\nWhat meditation? It sounds more like someone talking about enlightenment than about meditation.\n\n\"All you need to know is this\"\n\nSure, maybe, but applying it takes lifelong effort, because the brain doesn't stop, and the world doesn't stop. That's where a structured meditation practice comes in.\n\nIt is not that psychological discomfort is fake. We take as is if discomfort can be thrown out of the mind or covered up with solaces. The point is - Nothing can be thrown out of the mind.\nMeditation as an activity can become a relief seeking device to cover up irritations of daily life. One becomes addicted to escapes.\n\nAh, that wasn't how I saw your original post. Thank you for adding.\n\nEscapism hasn't been the variation of meditation that I've seen, and I still feel that knowing would be greatly assisted by mental efforts/meditation.\n\nAre you distinguishing between easing/relief from vs. Covering up? I'm quite addicted to putting my glasses on. It won't cure my eyes, but it lets me function much better.\n\nWe exist to experience relief, pleasure, happiness. But relief and so on is experienced against discomfort, uncertainty, problem, lack. As brain experiences anything as a contrast. Once you notice the bondage of discomfort - relief, fused state touches you.\n\nOff lately my brain's playing hide-and-seek with memories, especially the short-term ones!  Any mindfull technique for remedy?... Or should I just start writing post-it notes on my forehead?ü•¥\n\nMeditation on Christ is safe as opposed to abstract mindfulness."

This is what's known as yoga (union).\n\n**Translation:** When you are purely aware, without the hinderance of ego-based thoughts that don't serve you, you will perceive the world and yourself as unified. This can be realized by becoming aware of your awareness itself.\n\n&gt;In order to realize this, the heart needs to be pure.\n\n&gt;The heart is purified of vasanas (past tendencies) through sadhana (spiritual practice).\n\n&gt;With a pure heart one can see God. It literally says that in The Bible.\n\n**Translation:** When you let go of your psychological blocks to awareness itself (i.e. habitual thought patterns that don't serve you, negative surface emotions, and psychological complexities, all rooted in fear), your mind will calm down and allow pure awareness to come forth as the seat of your experience rather than thoughts that do not serve you well.\n\n&gt;Nirvikalpa Samadhi is when meditation no longer takes effort and seeking drops away. You realize your oneness with consciousness. The drop of water loses its identity in the ocean and becomes the ocean. The wave returns home to its source, like The Prodigal Son returns to his father in the parable.\n\n&gt;This realization is your birthright as a human being. Your suffering will end because without an \"I\", who's left to suffer?\n\n**Translation:** Once your mind is free of psychological blocks to awareness, and you are fully aware of awareness itself, what you used to achieve in meditation practice will be constant in your experience throughout your day. Life becomes meditation, and thus you no longer need to formally meditate. You will also perceive the world in a much different way than you do now, and that perception will include a feeling that there is no longer a \"you\" separate from the universe of your experience.\n\nIt is up to each individual to interpret this process as spiritual or holy or not, and this direct experience as God or the divine or not. Either way, it's beautiful. Thanks for your perspective.\n\nWell said, much appreciated. I hope others benefit as well.\n\nthe problem is developmental trauma is far from ‚Äúsurface level emotion‚Äù and the so-called spiritual traditions have a real problem with obscuring this. someone who was abused as a child does not start off meditation with the same nervous system as everyone else.\n\nI agree, and this is not to be underestimated. I wouldn't call trauma \"surface emotions\" as much as \"deeper psychological complexities\", and that can even be an understatement. Professional help is absolutely recommended, but there is certainly still hope for meditation to help, as while there may be a difference in nervous systems, we all likely have the same core awareness underneath and aware of our psychological issues (whether or not someone believes it is interconnected, part of one whole, spiritual, etc). In other words, in an experience of psychological trauma and all that comes with it, there is something that is aware of the trauma and all that comes with it, and that is not the trauma itself. It is awareness itself untainted by the trauma. The challenge is freeing up the mind enough to notice this, and those with developmental trauma, as you described, likely have a bigger hill to climb with this than others.\n\nNot sure what your point is, but as the other person said it just comes down to having a \"bigger hill to climb\" since the basic process is still the same.\n\nMeditation might, at first, not be the right way to make progress for a traumatised person. Awareness of their discomfort can trigger re-traumatising events. In such cases, psychological councelling or other ways of more safely connecting with your body and emotions may be necessary before starting since meditation may be too confronting.\n\nAmen\n\nExcellent translation and summary. Thank you.\n\nThank you for this!\n\nNo thanks to you guys for writing those beautiful and truly God's touching perspective and doctrines. üôèüôècan I please see u today I'm humbly   begging üôèüí®üíòü´∂üèΩ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•‚òùüèª‚öìÔ∏èü´¥ü§£\n\nthe microphone is 3 electric guitars\nthe microphone is 3 electric guitars\nthe microphone is 3 electric guitars\n\nThat is so condescending towards younger people. I‚Äòm certain older people had something similar to say about you when you were young :)\n\nthe microphone is 3 electric guitars\nthe microphone is 3 electric guitars\nthe microphone is 3 electric guitars\n\nWhat really baked my noodle was the realisation that when I stop seeking is the moment I find. When that insight kicked in meditation became silent moments of bliss and with that silence an unfathomable vastness emerged, with unimaginable depths to peer into. I have not yet reached bedrock. Far from it. It's like my soul recoils.\n\nBaked my noodle is funny üòÇüòÇ\n\nYou ARE what you were seeking, which is why you couldn't find it \"out there\".\n\nIt makes Bible verses like \"the kingdom of heaven is within you\" make a lot more sense.\n\nI can't take credit. It's from the first matrix movie which is very relevant as waking up is what meditation does. And yes. I concur. The kingdom of heaven really is closer than I ever thought it would be.\n\nI love that movie.\n\nEspecially when the kid is bending the spoon and then he says \"there is no spoon\".\n\nThis is a bit like saying that the way to combat disinformation is for everyone in the world to get a few PhDs.\n\nIt's not exactly wrong per se, it's not just not practically possible. Yes, if everyone could achieve the types of insights that most people spend lifetimes searching for, then the world would be a much better place. The only problem is that this sort of experience is rare for a reason; it genuinely takes a mountain of effort and practice, while dealing with any number of problems.\n\nAlso, human suffering might end if you find yourself closer to the divine... Just in time for the divine suffering to start. Human suffering is more like training wheels for true existential pain. The goal is not to achieve a state without suffering, it's to be in a state where suffering is just one of the things you feel, where suffering is just a sensation that you can interrupt if you don't want it to be there for a while, but which you will still have to accept as a natural part of yourself.\n\nYour birthright is not to be free of suffering, it is to master suffering. It is to be in a state where suffering causes you no harm, where it is just a passing emotion like any other.\n\nYa but I'd go one step further and say there is no real avoiding suffering. To your point, we can work to make it do *less* harm. But to eliminate harm from suffering entirely is to eliminate our humanity by becoming numb to it\n\nThe way I look at it is quite simple:\n\nThis world is the school.\n\nSuffering is the lesson.\n\nThe way you react to it is your grade.\n\nYa that's a clever way of looking at it. And it's in a way most people can understand without getting too deep into philosophy/religion/spirituality but also touches a little bit on all of them! I personally think this is how life should be approached to get the best grade possible, but hey, different strokes for different folks!\n\nThanks for truly teaching me with love and compassion ‚ù§Ô∏è üíï üíñ üíó ü´∂üèΩ‚òùüèªüôèüôè\n\nThanks for sharing, this is great. \n\nYou've succinctly described my ego death experience during clinical ketamine therapy for depression. \n\nI've not heard of Kirvikalpa Samadhi but will be looking it up more.\n\nYou're welcome.\n\nI'm glad I could be of some help.\n\nThat ego death can be made permanent and meditation will go on effortlessly.\n\nInterestingly enough, Nirvana is referred to as the \"blow out\" state or the \"sigh of relief\" for a reason.\n\nIt's quite a relief to get rid of the ego.\n\nI've been there at times, for some brief spans, which gives me hope. I ought to reconsider my hobbies.\n\nThere's a lot of aids to expand awareness.\n\nBut they can never remove the ego for good.\n\nThat's what sadhana (spiritual practice) is for.\n\nIf you ever want to learn the meditation that helped me, just send me a message.\n\nI would love to know more about this meditation! I can‚Äôt message you for some reason\n\nCan i ask what doses and how many sessions of K it took to get you there?\n\n6-8 and I forget the UOM but believe my last dose was 120 something?\n\nI Wonder who of you guys came ever close to this feeling? I mean is it really practical or more philosophy than reality ?\n\nMany people have, including myself.\n\nThis isn't just intellectual knowledge, but a direct perception of God within you.\n\nJust like Jesus says in The Bible \"the kingdom of heaven is within you\".\n\ni‚Äôve been trying to tell people !!\n\nI can appreciate that theory. As a near death experiencer who's had the honor of being in the presence of that infinitely loving God you mentioned and been fully conscious of it in the form of my soul without the anchor and limitations of this organic meat suit, I can say with 100% CERTAINTY if we all knew just how connected we are to each other and every living thing around us, we'd be ashamed of how we treat each other. \n\nOn the other side of that coin, we are much more than that. While the collective meaning of this human existence is that we learn how to love each other the way WE want to be loved, and do it selflessly with all the empathy and compassion we have, each of us have lived our own experiences. We all bear different scars from other people, our environments, and our individual experiences. If we didn't, we'd be one organic living organism. Just as no 2 trees or blades of grass are exactly alike, we are all very different. Because of those things, our capacity for the most important part of this life, love, can be a major factor in how things affect us. That's why the path to ending suffering on both the collective and individual level isn't as simple as you mentioned. There's some scars that never fully heal and big enough that it's the first thing not only we see looking into a mirror, but others see as well. This is why I now live through the hearts of others. It's often the only way to peace and happiness when your own heart is damaged beyond repair.\n\nI don't believe in this mumbo jumbo.\n\nhonestly just sit and watch your thoughts. you‚Äôll see you‚Äôre not in control. if you‚Äôre not in control then what the fuck is actually going on?\n\nyou‚Äôll eventually stumble into the mumbo jimbo OP is smokin\n\nI disagree here. To me, the top comment makes much more sense, explaining it in clear language that can be understood by everyone regardless of their point in the process, beliefs, or acquaintance with terminology. Referencing god is also clearly an abrahamic injection/interpretation of what can be buddhist or secular meditation as well.\n\ndirect experience will always be a better teacher than concepts\n\nI never contested that statement\n\nthen it looks like we‚Äôll have to agree then my friend\n\nIt‚Äôs hard once you start to feel close to universal consciousness not to feel a spiritual connection with everything, I‚Äôm an atheist and I‚Äôm starting to think the outside universe is a reflection of the inside universe you create.\n\nI'm kinda with you on this one. But hey if it adds meaning to your life then why not! Just wish it wasn't so absolutist and preachy sometimes\n\nThat's the ego, which is why I made the post.\n\nThe divine part of you knows and wants to awaken.\n\nIt's completely ok for someone else to have a different view point than your own! You've shared what you know to be true with others, but not everyone shares the same truths as you. This is how religion gets a bad reputation my friend\n\nThat's nice talk from the soft cushioned sofa. \"We're all one, there is no I and no suffering.\"\n\nLeave your sofa and become homeless (like there are hundreds of thousands) in a cold dark country, sleeping in the street, wet from the rain, detested by everyone and then try to say again \"we're all one, there is no I and no suffering.\"\n\nUnless you're a 1 in a million exception you will be humbled back to earth very quickly by your body.\n\nOn the other hand if a homeless person that has been living in this impossible situation for years and he tells me this same sentence, I will believe it.\n\nThat's strange because it's those exact conditions that tend to create a spiritual pursuit to rationalize what's happening in their life\n\nI am homeless.\n\nBefore I was homeless, I lived in extreme poverty and was abused by my narcissistic mom for over 30 years.\n\nShe tried to sabotage my spiritual search too, but I never let it stop me.\n\nAny other ignorant comments you want to leave me?\n\nCome on now, We gotta do better as people &amp; not assume. How you gonna assume they‚Äôre on their couch? What if it was a realization on their potty or in the midst of an Org@sm?\n\nWhy does ego not want to see.   \n\nI've tried to tell individuals that they are not,  of course, they do not listen.  \n\nHow can I speak to me!\n\nGive awakening time to grow. The false has to fall away.\n\nLike Sri Ramakrishna said, once the flower blooms, the bees come uninvited.\n\nbecause ‚Äúego‚Äù is literally what kept us alive in the wild for millions of years.\n\nYou gonna vote for Biden this year? Then you‚Äôre the problem. A Biden vote. A Trump vote. Is a vote for suffering and genocide. Vote 3rd party - Jill Sten in 2024\n\nIf your daily life is all about ‚Äúme,me,me‚Äù and never helping others etc I would strongly recommend the 10 commandments and love God.\n\n&gt;¬†¬†In order to realize this, the heart needs to be pure\n\n\nOr some good acid needs to be procured.\n\nThanks for truly having love and compassion for me,  you're all I need in God.... you're truly loved in my heart and there's no other way to express itüôèü´Çüíó‚öìÔ∏èü´∂üèΩüíòüßé‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüíébut the love in my heart can always be with you and I know you'll love me forever because I want you to truly love me like always üíì üíï üíñ ‚ô•Ô∏è üíó\n\nWhat if there is someone suffering and i become one with that person?\n\nYou're already one with them, you just don't realize it due to the ego.\n\nDamnit! But yeah i think you‚Äôre right it is a matter of acknowledgement\n\nYeah, the ego has to go.\n\nThat's what makes us think that we're not all one.\n\nDig up the problem at the root and it won't cause anymore problems.\n\nIt's takes more than an acknowledgement of what I said, that's just an intellectual understanding.\n\nThe ego can be removed through sadhana (spiritual practice).\n\nAy dios mio ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è the woo woo here\n\nThose that don‚Äôt  know will speak, those that know will speak. The answers are all inside.\n\nWithout suffering can one understand joy? With no counterpoise, no yang, joy would be meaningless.\n\nDo you wish an end to joy? \n\nThere are very clearly and obviously different concious entities, that was a pseudopoetic declaration not a justified statement. \n\nThe rest of your post contains multiple other assumptions and declarations which really don't match up with anything that I can make sense of. \n\nThen you drop God into the middle of that conversation. \n\nDon't kick against the pricks indeed.\n\nMeh it's a meditation subreddit, this stuff happens frequently. But I'm glad it's not a complete echo chamber, thank you for sharing your observations. I tend to agree with them\n\nOh, I know. I post like this occasionally just to see if there's a response. I use it as writing/thinking practice mostly. \n\nKinda like talking out loud. \n\nBut every now and then someone like you chimes in and maybe at least someone out there benefits from a little sensible practical reflections on the pseudo poetry we often encounter. Some of which is good I might add. \n\nThis, not so much. But I try not to judge. I'm getting better at it. I just don't want people going down all the dark rabbit holes I see them in.\n\n&gt;I just don't want people going down all the dark rabbit holes I see them in.\n\nOh man same boat. But I've found most people have a real issue in trying to persuade or even bring awareness to those rabbit holes. So much so that you will be attacked and they will try and shun you for doing so. I haven't figured out a solution to that part, there are too many rabbit holes here. It's like trying to stop the water from draining without a plug, that stuff is going down whether we like it or not and you'll die trying to get in front of the force of that flow lol.\n\nIt's almost as if what we're doing only works for people who already know they are rabbit holes... But I hope many more are potentially made aware. Nothing to do but believe in that\n\n&gt;Without suffering can one understand joy?\n\nI enjoy all the use of my senses everyday, but I don't have to experience the lack of them to appreciate these senses.\n\nIf joy was a default setting, then we would still experience the euphoric emotions and enjoy them.\n\nYou can't actually say that with knowledge. You can not possibly know that you would experience it the same way without suffering.\n\nPeople going through intense suffering almost universally express a greater joy when that suffering is removed. \n\nReality disagree's with your opinion and feelings are not like eyes so your response is not particularly convincing.\n\n&gt;People going through intense suffering almost universally express a greater joy when that suffering is removed. \n\nThat's called relief, relief from suffering and being happy you are no longer suffering. That is one of the millions of ways you can feel joy.\n\n&gt;Reality disagree's with your opinion\n\nWhat reality would that be? You haven't really tried at any counter arguments, just that I 'couldnt' possibly know. Where does the reality come into it?\n\nYou know, the feeling of any positive emotion is generally short-lived, we generally fade back to a baseline. Some people call it being content. But even having long periods of feeling content, people still experience joy, because something exciting happened, or they got great news about something, or they are doing something that is novel to them.\n\nThis is all philosophical and we don't live in a reality where suffering is absent, but I don't agree with the notion that we wouldn't really understand joy without suffering. In this hypothetical reality with no suffering, we would just simply continue to experience joy, because in our current reality, there are many levels to feeling joy, there's a scale. The absence of a joyous feeling, would just be how you normally feel.\n\n&gt;and feelings are not like eyes\n\nYour feelings are dependent on all of your senses. Your eyes see beautiful things, and trigger a wave of positive feelings. When I look at the sun set, how beautiful it is, I didn't need to witness the ugliest thing imaginable in order to appreciate it, and that is essentially your argument, this necessary Ying Yang.\n\n&gt;your response is not particularly convincing.\n\nDitto.\n\nNo. Permeant lifelong appreciation of joy. \n\nYou just swept the lived experience of many people that the rug as void without any good justification. \n\nWhere does reality come into it? Saying that joy can be understood as an absolute is.. nonsensical. \n\nNo analysis of human suffering would ever come to that conclusion. You may have some preconceived notion of suffering you're working from here you're not describing but what I've said concerning the reality of suffering in relationship to joy is covered in many meditation practices. \n\nYou just completely rejected the idea of yin yang there, so how's that for reality check? \n\nI mean where are you coming from?\n\nWhat do you really know of suffering? \n\nWhy do you given that suffering can not be absent so there is no possible way to even consider the idea of it being absent? How can you then say when so many day that joy and suffering are so closely linked? \n\nEven most secular practioneers understand this from experience. I don't understand why you don't or what you possibly did not understand about what I said previously. \n\nYou forgot a whole lot of what I actually said. \n\nCould you perhaps respond to the rest of the pay you ignored?\n\nBalance is a definite.\n It's the core to everything. Balance is off you are off. \nGod plays a big part in reaching ultimate self awareness\n\nThere is a problem with your suggestion there.\n\nHave you ever walked before? Do you actually understand how you walk? You are literally actually falling forward intentionally and catching yourself.\n\nEvery step you take is enabled by the imbalances you create.\n\nGod is a concept, one that probably has a place in your mind that is very different from mine. So I can not really respond to where you believe this self awareness is coming from.\n\nIt is a contradiction in terms to find self awareness from an external source though. Others may guide, but self awareness can only come from the self.\n\nSelf awareness comes from every thing. How would you know to be better do better. If you only counting on you.  God can help family friends. You seem very aggressive and I'm assuming at gatherings your topic is right nobody else. You need to have some yang with that yin\n\nYou misread emotion where there is none. These are simple questions nothing more.\n\nI'm not entirely sure why you decide to read that negatively but I think you may be the one off balance here if you read that that way.\n\nWhy does a soul have to suffer through all this? Who asked for any of it? Why is ‚ÄúGod‚Äù such a self-righteous dick? End rant.\n\nWhy do people suffer through school and university? The kids usually aren't asking to be taught, yet why are teachers and profs such self-righteous dicks.\n\nSouls should just wallow in dull, dead mediocrity for all eternity. That would be better, no?\n\nWhy would the \"ever-loving\" Universe, made of \"love\", filled with \"loving-kindness\" subject itself to experience life as we know it? I don't know about your teachers, mine, for the most part were underpaid, broken humans - again the Universe experiencing misery for reasons unknown.\n\n\"Wallowing in dull, dead mediocrity for all eternity\" - how do you know this? I mean seriously, I want to know how can you definitively know this? \n\nDoes wearing a linen loin cloth and sitting uncomfortably on a \"meditation\" cushion from IKEA make your soul any better than mine? Just remember this the next time you're feeling extra special - your chances of achieving enlightenment are lower than winning the Powerball Lottery. So good luck with that Chief.\n\nYou seem to have confused \"love\" with \"happiness\" or  \"joy.\"\n\nLove may be a source of happiness and joy, but it is also a source of hatred and jealousy. It's not an inherently good or bad force, it just happens to be the driving force of this universe. All the horrors of the world are all horrors created out of the force that is love. Same with all the greatest things too. It's sort of like saying matter is made out of atoms. All the most horrific criminals, as well as all the holiest saints were made of atoms, just like they were composed of divine love. This doesn't makes atoms good or bad, and the same is true for divine love.\n\nKindness too is not the happy, simple thing you might think it to be either. Being kind is not the same as being nice. A nice parent will see a kid fall off a bike and scratch their knee, and will instantly take the kid home, give them ice cream, and tell them that they never have to rid the bike again if they don't want to. A kind parent will tend to the wound, and will tell the kid to get back on the bike because it's a useful skill to have. Taken to the extreme, such kindness can cause pain beyond measure.\n\nWhen you are told to accept loving-kindness, that means accepting the dark, negative sides of these aspects as well.\n\n&gt;  I don't know about your teachers, mine, for the most part were underpaid, broken humans - again the Universe experiencing misery for reasons unknown.\n\nYour teachers were the Universe, just like mine. All the people, all the books, all the lectures, all the videos, all the discussions, all the events, all the coincidences, and even all the thoughts; these are all gifts given to you in by a kind Universe, in the hopes that you use them go learn the lessons that can not be given, but instead must be experienced.\n\n&gt; \"Wallowing in dull, dead mediocrity for all eternity\" - how do you know this? I mean seriously, I want to know how can you definitively know this?\n\nDo you? Really? You're having trouble dealing with mild suffering of the body and mind, and you think you want to know about the intense suffering of the soul?\n\nImagine you've just stubbed your toe for the first time, and your reaction is \"Man, I want to know what it's like to have both my legs amputated.\" It's probably much, much worse than what you're imagining, and you probably have no context to understand any further.\n\nYou hang out long enough, you study things in enough detail, you explore enough corners of existence, you dedicate enough time to meditation and exploration and understanding, and you can get to know all sorts of things... While paying all sorts of prices. If you want certainty, then too bad, try another existence. If you want to simply expand your awareness though, there's plenty of ways to do that.\n\n&gt; Does wearing a linen loin cloth and sitting uncomfortably on a \"meditation\" cushion from IKEA make your soul any better than mine?\n\nWhat?\n\nMeditation is just a skill, it doesn't make a soul better or worse. If you mean me personally, I would imagine you wouldn't be able to find an entity with a soul more broken then mine, so have no worries your soul is almost certainly better. Thanks for rubbing it in though, I really appreciate being reminded of that.\n\n&gt; Just remember this the next time you're feeling like you're feeling extra special - your chances of achieving enlightenment are lower than winning the Powerball Lottery. So good luck with that Chief.\n\nI assure you, enlightenment is not all it's cracked up to be either. I have no idea why so many people seem intent on going in that direction.\n\nI appreciate the time you took to respond. I will review it and get back to you in a day or so.\n\nI mean you touch on some really good points. Whatever is causing this suffering is systemic by nature. How we rationalize/respond to it is the absolute key here. There just happens to be many ways to go about that. Choose one that works for you and by extension works for other people. That's all that really matters in the end. I'm right there with you, so let's make the world a better place together¬†\n\nIf it‚Äôs not I n suffering, it‚Äôs insufferable.¬†\n\nIt‚Äôs 3am. If we would stop posting tonite, maybe I could get some sleep."

    "title": "Breath meditation tips from 3,000 hours of meditation",
    "body": "I have clocked in over 3,000 hours of breath meditation and vipassana meditation over the last 3 years. And I have learned a few things or two about having more effective meditation sessions.\n\n\r  \nBefore sharing some of those tips, I wanted to share my perspective on thoughts. We all know that during breath meditation, and really any other meditation, lots of thoughts come to interrupt. A lot of different people have different ways of relating to it, with the majority of experienced meditators accepting that they are thinking and bringing their awareness back to breath. I agree with this, but I also want to build on this.\n\n\r  \nI noticed something about my thoughts when I am doing things other than meditating. **And that is that it is very easy to stop thinking. It is very easy to have your thoughts be quiet for extended periods of time.** Whenever I am watching a TV show I enjoy, or talking with someone, or doing work, or really anything that is really engaging to me, my thoughts are mainly quiet. I could literally not have a single thought when watching a show. Of course I am computing and understanding the show and I might have reactions here and there. But when I get engrossed, my own separate thoughts do not pop up and distract me.\n\n\r  \nSo this gave me the insight that when my meditation is highly engaging and I am deeply interested in it, that I can have long stretches of concentrated periods of meditation. **When the meditation is fun and I am on the edge of my seat to know what is happening, I can have even up to an hour straight of focused undistracted attention.**\n\n\r  \nThese techniques that I am going to share revolving around breath meditation are meant to **make meditation more engaging. They are meant to evoke a sense of curiosity, to shift your perspective, and deepen your meditation  practice.**\n\n\r  \nWith the breath meditation I do, I focus exclusively on the nostril area. So keep that in mind as I explain them.\n\n\r  \nThe first thing to do is to realize the nature of your distractions. If you are reliving a traumatic experience in your mind, or something that evokes a great deal of emotion or attachment, then use the following technique:\n\n\r  \nHave deep intentional breaths. Keep your awareness in your nostril. When your mind settles down, return to natural breath. Repeat this cycle until you mind is more settled. You may at times only do intentional breaths for your whole practice, and that‚Äôs okay. Other times, you may only need to do it for a few minutes and then the storm passes.\n\n\r  \nThe other kind of distractions are less serious. More just your average joe thoughts about mundane things. Maybe about to do lists, or plans for the future, or remembering a funny memory, etc. The following techniques should be used when you have these kinds of distractions.\n\n\r  \n1)\tNostril switching. Focus on your breath at the entrance and inner walls of your nostrils. When you catch yourself distracted, bring your focus on only one nostril, the right or the left. If you are distracted again, switch to the other nostril. Stay for a cycle of breath. If still distracted, switch to the other nostril. Stay for a cycle. Continue to switch nostrils while maintaining a natural breath. This will sharpen your mind since you are focusing on an even smaller area by bringing most of your attention to one nostril. And the movement from nostril to nostril between natural breaths will take energy away from the thoughts. Once the thoughts settle, continue to focus on one nostril. For as long as your are focused. When distracted, start the switching again. When focused, focus on one nostril. Repeat this as many times as necessary.\n\n\r  \n2)\t4 nostril walls: this builds off of the technique above. Notice the 4 walls or side of your nostrils. Top, right side, bottom, and left side. Bring your focus to one wall of your nostrils. For example, observing the incoming and outgoing breath from the bottom wall of both nostrils. This is a bit hard to do, but it is challenging. And that challenge will lead to more engagement as your mind tries to accomplish this goal. If you find yourself distracted, move to another wall like the left walls. Now observe your breath coming and going from this side. This will again change your perspective and invoked curiosity in your mind. Your breath feels different from different walls because they are different angles. If you are distracted again, switch to the top wall. Like above, stay at each wall for at least one cycle of breath before switching. Switch until your mind settles down. Then focus on whatever wall you are on when your mind is concentrated. Once you lose concentration, switch again.\n\n\r  \n3)\tSpace between breath. This one is a little harder and more subtle and should be practiced when you have been consistently able to have longer periods of focus using the two techniques above. Focus on the wall that separates your nostrils. The thing in between your nostrils (I don‚Äôt know the name of it). Observe your incoming and outgoing breath from here. Its like you are standing by a rock that is splitting heavy ocean waves coming in. and the waves crash around the rock, but the rock is protecting you. In the same way, this wall separates the waves of breath coming and going and parts them. Try to observe your breath from here to immerse yourself in the breath.\r  \n\r  \n\r\r  \nAll of these techniques are meant to challenge your mind and make your meditation experience more unique. Imagine you love eating chocolates, but if you had a bar, the next one isn‚Äôt as good. And the one after isn‚Äôt as good. The 4th you might say you have chocolate. But having some chocolate today, eating some other things over the next couple of days, and then having chocolate again will make it taste delicious. Meditating with the breath is the same. If you keep doing the same thing over and over, it will get boring, and stale and you might even say you hate it. But all you had to do is switch it up, do some other things, and then come back. That is what these techniques are for. To help you keep it exciting and fresh so that you are more engaged. And that will lead to being better at meditating. Having longer periods of focus. And gaining deeper insights into the nature of reality.\r  \n\r  \nThis is already a long post so I will stop here. I did make a video about this with even more techniques and methods you can use to have a deeper breath meditation experience. Check it out here: [https://youtu.be/sIRl-S\\_FICI](https://youtu.be/sIRl-S_FICI)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHappy to answer any questions!\r  \n",

    "all_comment_text": "I really appreciate this post\n\nI'm glad üòä. I hope it leads to you becoming a better happier person.\n\ni just want to say that i think this is really wonderful. i can see your vipassana training here very clearly!\n\ngoing to try integrating this into my practice, thank you for the insight.\n\nI am so happy to hear that. This is a part of my Metta practice and spreading the good joys I get from my practice with others. \n\nI am glad you found this useful and hope it helps you on your journey!\n\nThank you for sharing! I started to meditate about two weeks ago. I‚Äôm a true beginner and never really considered this ‚Äústuff‚Äù as helpful and a healthy practice. I love yoga, but never really got into the ‚Äúspiritual‚Äù aspect of it until recently. I had a bizarre experience with it a little over a week ago. I think it‚Äôs called ‚Äúdisassociating‚Äù or something like that. Like I said, I‚Äôm not familiar with it, but what I felt made me realize there‚Äôs more to our minds than we thought. I honestly felt like I was out of my body, somewhere else. In all honesty, it scared the shit out of me. It was unexpected, but I want to know more about it and further explore it.\n\nOne of the main benefits of meditation is self awareness and understanding of the reality of the self. I am glad you have started walking on this path. \n\nThe whole of yoga, the practice of mindful movement, is there to prepare you and compliment your meditation practice! So you're right on track!\n\nI appreciate that. Thank you\n\nDoes prolonged rapture come up followed by a nimitta? What happens after that,and howe long does it persist?\n\nI'm not too sure I understand those terms. If nimitta means prolonged explosive engagement with the breath, then I might have something to say. \n\nThere is a lot of information packed into the breath. All the universal laws are at play. So what happens with extended periods of focused uninterrupted exclusive awareness of the breath is that more universal data is consumed. Which somehow transforms into insights into the nature of the self and reality. \n\nIt's like not experiencing yourself as the habitual thoughts, emotions, and reactions that you are leads to more knowledge about it. Like when you sleep on a problem and you wake up with an answer. Or you take a break and do wondering what, and when you come back you know the answer. It's like that. You take a break or sleep on your habitual patterns of being and when you come back, you have a fresh perspective and wisdom. \n\nThis wisdom will always be with you, even if you don't think about it so the time.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the eighth step of the Eightfold Path - the jhanas. This booklet explains nimittas and how they are preliminary to the jhanas. It's free and instantly available on screen. \n\n¬†¬† [https://bswa.org/bswp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/ajahn-brahm\\_the-basic-method-of-meditation.pdf](https://bswa.org/bswp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/ajahn-brahm_the-basic-method-of-meditation.pdf)\n\nThanks for posting this.  I really like the technique of sub-dividing the nostril.  I'll try that one for sure.\n\n  \nAnd btw, The thing in between your nostrils (I don‚Äôt know the name of it). That is called the septum :)\n\nAh, thank you! \n\nI hope it helps your mediation practice! Let me know how it goes. I would love to know if someone else's experience of these techniques provides the same benefit!\n\nI tried out the nostril walls (and then septum) focus with my sit this morning.   Very interesting.  I could feel the changing temperature gradient move from front to back with the breath.  I could feel the pressure (in/out) with the breath, and I could feel the very subtle movement in space with the micro movements of my head/body.\n\nIt definitely helped me with focus and I also became aware of more subtle sensations in that area than I had before.\n\n  \nThanks again for sharing!\n\nThat is incredible. Having all these new variables in breath meditation makes it a lot more engaging and fun to explore in my opinion. And there will many subtle sensations to explore. \n\nGlad this was able to help you. Let me know if you ever hit a rut. There's many more interesting things can be done to keep it fresh and exciting.\n\nThank so much! It really met a need!\n\nDid you try and it helped? \n\nWohoooo. I'm glad it supported you or will continue to support you through your mediation journey.\n\nI am so thankful for your post! I‚Äôve been practicing meditation about three years now on and off. One thing I am really missing is get in a community and start discussing my interest about meditation. I feel like no one around me share the same interest like I do, and I am ashamed to talk about it to others as well. I love that your ultimate goal is to understand more about our reality. I can relate to that. Hope we will get super close through practice!\n\nI feel the same. As many benefits as meditation has, it's surprising how little people practice in the world. Besides when I go to meditation course, there really aren't a lot of people to talk to about it. \n\nI'm glad reddit, YouTube, and other platforms exist where we can talk about this a little more. \n\nVery happy to talk about meditation anytime. It's my favorite thing to talk about because it's almost about everything. \n\nWalking the meditation path with others of the same path is of utmost importance. Happy to walk that path together üòä\n\nThanks!\n\nYou're welcome\n\nThank you for sharing üôè\n\nOf course. I hope it's helpful in your practice.\n\nBrilliant. Thank you!\n\nI'm glad you enjoyed it! I hope it makes your mediation experience a little better!\n\nThanks for sharing your experience and wisdom, I'll make sure to apply your teachings into my meditation session. I'm still a beginner so it's transformative to have the guidance of some much more experienced people.\n\nI'm glad to hear this. It's my intention to continue to put out information about meditation and help people become better meditators. \n\nI'm glad it's useful. Let me know how your mediation session goes when you implement some of these techniques. \n\nThere are also more beginner friendly techniques I will be sharing in the future.\n\nAs a beginner, thank you  \nI've been struggling with consistency meditating and after around 7 minutes I tend to get really bored, so I will implement this when I meditate and I'm sure I will feel more engaged when focusing on my breath.\n\nI'm glad you found some of these tips useful. I hope you have a better mediation because of it. \n\nPlease let me know if it works for!\n\nThank you for the tips. Been meditating off and on for years. More consistently the past few months and my biggest issue is settling on a technique. There‚Äôs mantra, breath and any assortment of ways to focus. I typically land on breath while I settle the mind and I also focus my attention on the nostrils. I like the focus shifting. Sort of like changing the gaze from rock to sand in a zen garden. \n\nI look forward to trying this out with tonight‚Äôs sit. \n\nMay you be well\n\nAh yes. I was like that as well. I tried many other but eventually dedicated myself to breath meditation. I than stayed Vipassana meditation, which systematically and deeply observed sensations of the body. \n\nIf you practice the part of my tips related to making the area of awareness much smaller, like focusing on one nostril or the septum, you'll begin to prepare yourself for Vipassana. \n\nIf you're ready to a huge step toward. Consider going to a free 10 day Vipassana meditation course offered all over the world. Go to dhamma.org and look for courses near you. \n\nIt's intense and like 10-14 hours of mediation a day. But it will help take you to the next level. \n\nYou may take that course and decide this path isn't for you, but I fully believe it is worth trying out. It will take your meditation to the next level.\n\nMay you gain wisdom and happiness through your own efforts.\n\nThank you for your post.\n\nI have been meditating while focusing on the nostril breathing for a few months now and sometimes find it difficult to stay focused, so I am looking forward to trying these techniques.\n\nI hope these will also help me to not feel like I am about to nod off asleep, which happens when I am tired and meditating.\n\nI do not have the time to take a vipassana retreat, I have too many work and family commitments, but I would love to deepen my practice by learning more about the vipassana system, could you suggest some resources that might help?\n\nThanks.\n\nVipassana is a type of body scanning meditation. Those are plenty easy to find. Why the 10 days are necessary to teach this though is to break through to a certain subtle level of the body. For instance, it might take me 1 whole hour to even just my hand because my awareness is only a centimeter or two wide as I scan. This sharpness of awareness and unlocking the very subtle sensations of the body takes a long time. \n\nThat's why it's taught at a 10 day retreat where you can fully sharpen your mind. Working with the body at the subtlest level sensations is the practice of Vipassana. \n\nBody scanning meditations can be easily found online. However, I would recommend continuing your breath meditation and sharpen your mind. \n\nThe smaller the area of awareness, the sharper that your mind will become. So if you do some of the techniques mentioned above and make the area of awareness smaller, like focusing on just one nostril, then you can begin to feel subtler sensations. \n\nAnd don't stop there. Make it even smaller to half a nostril. Then a quarter. Then an eighth. All the way down to being the smallest tip you can make your awareness. Don't do this in one sitting though. Find a small enough sizing to be challenging, but not so challenging that you're holding your breath or becoming really tense or start getting a headache. As you proceed, naturally make the area smaller. \n\nI don't know if just reading it will fully explain it, maybe I'll make a video on it.\n\nAlready, I hope this helps.\n\nVery interesting, thanks.\n\nYou're welcome!\n\nOften when I try to focus on one part of my body, like the nostrils, then I notice that I start creating 3D visualisations of that part of the body, do those 3D visualisations count as a thought or are they part of focussing on the body?\n\nI would recommend to discuss less on the visualization and give now importance to the actual breath. If the visualization just keep happening, that's okay, but don't intentionally do it. \n\nIn the video I talk about meditation being a way to observe the nature of reality. Therefore you just observe the natural real breath as it is. If you start focusing on visualizations, then you're focusing on your imagination. Your imagination is not reality. \n\nSo continue to give more importance to the real breath when you are meditating.\n\nRight, I understand, but what happens with me is that, it's tough to explain, uhh\n\nIt's basically like patterns or shapes coming in and being destroyed or like tv static, which constantly keeps occurring and feels almost impossible to ignore, how can I deal with that?\n\nI think it's important to note that all these patterns that occur are very fast and noisy and busy\n\nI think it just takes skills. Don't bother yourself with falling to ignore it. Just do what you can to keep your awareness on your breath. Implement any of the techniques I've mentioned to make the meditation more engaging. \n\nIf these things pop up on their own, that's 100% okay. You're not expected to be any more than trying your best. \n\nKeep moving your awareness around your nostrils. Let the visions, shapes, and patterns happen. But where you can and have the power to, try to focus. \n\nSo it's a balance of trying to focus and accepting whatever arises. Definitely don't get down on yourself. You'll just be going backwards.\n\nThanks! Your technique of switching nostrils is actually incredible. It helped a lot\n\nThat's good to hear! We're you a little more concentrated and engaged with the meditation? \nDid you feel more benefits from your mediation session?\n\nNot necessarily more benefits, but noticed that I was able to achieve my desired depth easier\n\nThat's amazing. The depth is where I get a lot of the benefits from.\n\nIf you‚Äôre sitting there goofing around with your nose for 3k hours you‚Äôre not meditating, there is no point to meditating and thoughts about breathing are still thoughts not nothing.¬†\n\nThanks for your thoughts\n\nThoughts are the enemy of peace.¬†\n\nThoughts are an amazing tool for the creation and spreading of wisdom and joy.\n\nOk save the world then. I‚Äôm talking about nothing and how it‚Äôs right there behind all our thoughts¬†\n\nThat was an interesting read. I like to drift between thinking deeply about this and that and focus on the breath. But mine is a more global focus: abdomen, throat, nose... wherever the breath may go. The sound of it too. A feeling of peace will rise, and then I focus on that feeling. At first, I needed a few breaths to bring it up during the day, now the peaceful feeling is almost always there now, even without meditating. It feels like a soft smile, all over me.\n\nIf I may ask, why do you meditate? \n\nAlso, do you get those meditation pains? I get random flare ups half way in my sessions. I just let them come, be and go. From experience, I know it's just the nerves recombobulating and not serious. \n\nDo you get energy sensations? Can you bring the energy up at will?\n\nHave you noticed your mood improving off cushion? If you stop for a few days, does your mood fall back down?\n\nHave you tried different focuses? Music or metta? Why the breath? I personally try to go for 3 hours a day... don't you feel the need? The need for speed? üòéüòéüöóüèéüöÇ\n\nThanks for sharing your experience.\n\nI meditate to understand the nature of reality. To gain wisdom to live in alignment with this nature.\n\nI try to not create or alter any sensations I might have that come up in my body. So I don't intentionally try to move energy. \n\nIf I stop meditating, yes I lose the benefits it gives me. My mood falls back down. \n\nI do breath meditation and Vipassana, which is a deep intense form of scanning sensations in the body.\n\n&gt; I could literally not have a single thought when watching a show. &lt;\n\nYou always have thousands of thoughts. What you describe is that your mind is occupied to the point that none of these thoughts rise high enough in importance to be (forcefully) presented to you (or you getting aware of it which is actually the same).\n\nInstead of clocking 3000 hours with these nostril stuff, why not learn another meditation practice? Start with focusing on the center of each hand's palm and switch between them. Also check the many traditions they all have movement pattern or certain points they switch attention to. Beside switching attention constantly moving the focus of attention throughout the body is even more engaging for your mind.\n\nYou might also want to check out body movements like TaiChi and ChiGong as you will learn something about what true meditation does look like and why it works. \n\nYour post missed a lot of experiences and hints that I would expect from someone who does meditation for 3000h in 3 years which means that you claim 1000h per year which translates to 3h+ per day. At this point you should be further ahead than what you present here.\n\nThank you for your input."

    "all_comment_text": "John Butler, a very spiritual man, once said something that has always stuck with me: \"God is peeling the potatoes.\"  \n\nHe discusses the very subject you bring up, which he refers to as \"feeling presence\". In regards to feeling this presence on a regular basis (which has many names: The Universe, Enlightenment, Spirit, The Soul, Allah, Yahweh, or in this case as John likes to call, God, which I will also largely refer to for simplicity) it requires becoming attuned to the most mundane of practices. Such as talking to your wife. Or doing the dishes. Or prepping food. Or turning a page in a book. Brushing your teeth. Selecting an apple from a fruit stand at the grocery store. After all, our lives are almost entirely a collection of pretty mundane tasks! \n\nRemember this peaceful blissed out feeling you desire is not just sitting in quite reflection as part of a conscious decision to meditate. It is all around us. And the more you notice and practice tuning in, you find it everywhere. As John also likes to say, we are held in stillness. Stillness is always here. We just have to tune in. It requires vulnerability, wisdom, and curiosity.\n\nBUT, just as importantly- It needs to be understood that we should NOT strive to put our head in the clouds and think that the only way to feel bliss is to constantly think about God or Enlightenment. On the contrary. The task itself IS God. When you think about potatoes, you are already thinking about God, because God is the act of peeling and the potato. God is talking to your wife and is your wife. God is taking care of your children and is your children. There is no need to separate them, and by doing so you go against the nature of yourself and God. When you separate the task from God, you separate yourself from God. You are already doing exactly what you have been aching to do! And when you fully realize and understand this, there is nothing to do but laugh and shake your head. You are what you seek. \"The Cosmic Joke\", as Alan Watts and many Zen masters like to call this. There is no need to strain and think holy thoughts whilst going about every task of your day. God is just a symbol. That is why, I think, John likes to refer to this as a \"presence\". It is a feeling of life, universe, and time unfolding infinitely all around us and within us. Utterly undefinable. God, and even the word \"presence\", can only hint as to what it really means. That is because it's highly individual and different for us all. A blanket term for such a deep and profound feeling as bliss or God or Enlightenment is to be taken with a grain of salt. These terms are conversation starters, not definitions.\n\nIf you're interested in hearing more from John Butler: https://youtu.be/fZXhPmHPoNo?si=zeEeSy6iF2R_Dyev starts at 1:37\n\nIn Hinduism this is called [karma yoga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karma_yoga).\n\nyoull probably like this?\n\n\nhttps://youtu.be/votJ4Qg5WtI?si=y_wVM_UurqYkUeEv\n\nBeautiful. Thank you\n\nJack Kornfield has a great book on this subject called After the Ecstasy the Laundry. It basically explains that there is no permanent enlightenment or enlightened state a practitioner can achieve and how to deal with the realities of modern living after experiencing the peaceful, blissful potential of certain meditative states.\n\n\nYour local library should have it or grab for a couple bucks off a second hand site like abe.com\n\nSecond this, it‚Äôs like anything that feels good - it can‚Äôt last forever\n\nThere‚Äôs a mindset of being ‚Äúgrounded‚Äù in your day to day life and consciously ‚Äúgrounding‚Äù yourself that works pretty harmoniously with meditation\n\nThere‚Äôs spiritual aspects to this but in reality it‚Äôs really just a conscious practice of trying to mentally ‚Äúfeel‚Äù certain parts of your body (starting with tailbone when sitting)\n\nI wouldn't necessarily say it can't be permanent. Some people have realised permanent states of bliss\n\nMy awakening lasted for about 5 months. Bliss throughout. Mindful. Present. Detached. Until I went back home and realized that nothing had really changed except me. Friends didn't like me. They preffered the depressed old self. Being rejected for who I was did a number on me so I returned to an older version of myself.\n\nBeen there, done that, but with travel combined with my dad dying. You want to upgrade your social circles, and that may mean letting go of friendship dynamics that no longer serve you.\n\nAgreed.\n\nCan relate. A lot of people from an \"old\" phase of your life simply can't comprehend that you've changed for the better, they probably never will. While I didn't completely ditch any people from my old phase I did distance myself heavily and lower the amount of communication. I test the waters from time to time to check if they make any changes but so far they're pretty much staying the same so I just back off once again.\n\nMy condolences to Jack Kornfield and to anyone who believes what he has to say. The pleasure of meditation arises naturally due to non identification with the superficial self. The carry over of non identified bliss is tied directly to the skill level of the practicioner. If you work your way up into habitual non identification, and remain in the observer state for the majority of your daily living - you will be in peaceful radiant bliss internally without cessation.\n\nThe bliss state fading for practicioners is simply a skill and experience issue. The observer state is available at any moment, even during sleep. For meditators who have a difficulty in bridging the gap between meditation and their daily living I would point you to the Fourth Way as taught by Gurdjeff and Ospensky. Meditation is a way of life not an activity or a hobby. You are the observer, not anything else. And the state of the observer is effortless joy. Do the work and the state is yours to experience.\n\nThose who believe what he has to say, as quoted in the book, include meditation masters of multiple faiths and practices.¬†\n\n\nBut no doubt, had he had the pleasure of studying under u/neoAnalist he would have achieved pure and absolute enlightenment by now.\n\n\nPity¬†\n\nAny meditation master who claims that permanent moment to moment enlightenment is not possible, is not worth the focus and attention of anyone undertaking meditation. Any master can only bring you to his level and no further. The play of life, the state of experiencing reality as Lila is what the Bhagavad-Gita teaches, it is to a lesser degree the void state expounded by the Buddha and it is the state of Agape illustrated by Christ. It is the state Rumi and the Sufi mystics spent their life communicating in poetry and art. The wu wei of the Tao and the pinnacle state of the fourth way.\n\nIt is possible and don't let anyone tell you otherwise. Let their belief be washed away by direct experience. To take up a belief before the corresponding experience is to limit your conscious expansion to pre determined parameters, consciousness is boundless, and the absolute state of being is available at any moment. How well one can experience that state and for how long is down to the level of excellence they have achieved in their practice.\n\nHey, I'm a complete beginner to this. How can I start to practice this state of observer-ship? I've done practices before where I notice when I'm thinking and I gently release it and relax. Is that the right idea?\n\nI feel when I just watch my breath that I treat it as \"something to do\" but releasing / non-doing really helps like when I catch myself thinking.\n\nI'd appreciate your thoughts and pointers to books, resources, and small habits to pick up. Greatly appreciated.\n\nI would recommend starting with the Commentaries on Gurdjeff by Maurice Nicoll, I have posted the pdf links to all 6 volumes previously.\n\nThe observer state is the one state upon which all other experience is based. The essence or the observer is first and foremost, mental, emotional and sensory impressions all use the essence to have their moment in the light of consciousness. The predominant barrier to long lasting enlightenment is the false identification with habituated combinations of mental+emotional+sensory which form what you can think of as an ego, which takes over your essence and forces your observation of impressions into some preestablished filter. Your personal state of boredom, or temper, addiction etc. These are all seperate egos that incoherently play their prerecorded response to impressions by taking your conscious awareness hostage for a time.\n\nSelf-remembering is as simple as promoting your observer state to notice that it's there. \"Where am I right now\" meaning am I lost in a memory, am I lost in thoughts or some strong emotions, or am I here and present in this instant. Performed as often as possible throughout the day.\n\nSelf-observation is once you've shocked the observer state awake, you give it control of the system of egos and incoming impressions. From there, you can keep the good egos, and procedurally discard the negative ones who do you no service in experiencing this life. Eventually the good egos are dissolved into one coherent well intentioned ego that the observer state can use to play out life until it no longer needs the ego.\n\nA wonderful practice in this method of meditation is the finger tap method (I call it the Midas Touch):\n\n- Establish Observer state identification, reflective non reactive intentional percieving of the incoming impressions (internal/external) in the present moment.\n\n- Decide how long you will do thr Midas Touch exercise for.\n\n- Sit or do some mundane mechanical activity such as walking\n\n- Your thumb will now represent your essence/observer state. Your index finger your mental impressions, your middle finger your emotional impressions, your ring finger your sensory motor impressions.\n\n- As the observer, the exercise is to identify the predominant impression at any given time. Say you are walking (the automatic walking does not need to be acknowledged on the finger tapping but if you become expressly aware of your foot making contact with the ground or you feel your nose itching you would tap your thumb to the ring finger for as long as that sensory impression is predominant). \n\n-You should aim to tap the correct corresponding finger as soon as you note the impression, sometimes you might engage with a passing thought and not even notice you're doing it (in this case the observer state is lost for that brief moment but as soon as its back, we tap the index finger denoting mental activity being observed.)\n\nDo this for as long as you like. You'll notice the longer you can remain in the observer state the less disturbances arise naturally. This exercise is only to help you train the perception of impressions and acknowledge when you have lost your Self to impressions or to some ego configuration.\n\nIf you're serious about achieving a pure state of being it is worth establishing the ability to hold your mental breath, by this I mean the ability to freeze and dissolve your mental activity at a moments notice. Tremendously helpful in maintaining observer state identification once you can do it.\n\n-Practice this by mentally singing the lyrics to some song you like and have memorized. At random moments in the recalling of the lyrics freeze your mind. Notice the impulse that wants to continue the rhythm of the lyrics, notice the outrage of the mind against being stopped. Practice until you can get a clean stop, and know that it can be applied even before a full thought manifests in the mind. When you can percieve the budding of mental activity you can quench it before it develops into a full thought through applying the mental hold or freeze.\n\n-Important to note that emotional and sensory impressions can similarly be frozen or held with intention once your observer regains control of the system.\n\n*People on this subreddit seem to love passive observation, where every impression is given passage into the realm of the observer. This is all well and good once the observer-egos-structure of the personality is organised and under control. But if the observer is not yet the chief state active in this composite structure, then we must take great discernment in what impressions are allowed in and what pieces of the false self must be burned off like dead-wood.*\n\nHave you achieved this permanent state of enlightenment?\n\nI have yet to achieve such perfect practice. But sun up to sundown observership has been experienced, with some scattering of observer awakening during dreaming. If you practice this way of constant meditation, you know that the frequency and duration grows with time and experience.\n\nSo what once is a great achievement, lets say 1 straight hour of observer state identification. Becomes commonplace. And you soon string many of these hours together where you take impressions in, apply no automatic mental framework to any of it, have no unprompted mental chatter, feel no discomfort or suffering of any kind, just an overwhelming sense of peaceful joy at the direct perception of existence.\n\nTurns out the function of an individual is hindered by their personality not aided by it. In the observer state you will find your interaction with life much improved in all aspects. Maximum lucidity of mind, freedom to respond or not respond to any impression internal or external, tremendous capacity for creativity and compassion and many more notable benefits.\n\nWell let me know when you do.\n\nBalance. being in a parasympathetic state constantly is not a good thing nor is being stressed out and being in flight or fight constantly. The calmness and mindfulness from your practice is carried over into your daily life and experience. The cumulative long term benefits are really the best part of meditation. your nervous system will always seek homeostasis. You still are a in a mostly dominant parasympathetic state. you carry over the calmness and insight into your daily experience at least this is my opinion on the matter\n\nBest answers yet here Tony. Makes so much sense to me. Thank you\n\nOf course man anytime, I‚Äôve done extensive scientific research and research on meditation and optimizing it, if you have any questions feel free to shoot me a message\n\nI'd be interested in more recommendations to learn more.\n\nI‚Äôm always open to chat if you have any questions regarding anything, shoot my a message or you can ask here I‚Äôll be glad to help in any way I can\n\nCould you provide more insight into how being in a parasympathetic state is not a good thing?\n\nShould it be 50/50? Or should being in a parasympathetic state be your baseline which you can shift away from when needed?\n\nBalance in everything is an easy answer to everything of course. But I‚Äôve never met someone who was too much in a parasympathetic state, but I could name a thousand examples of the opposite.\n\nGurudev Amrit Desai claims to be 80/20 parasympathetic vs sympathetic. He turned 92 this year and is still guiding meditations. \n\nI personally care more about optimal states and how to reach and maintain them sustainably for me.\n\nYou want to be in a ‚Äúmostly‚Äù parasympathetic state not 50/50 That‚Äôs the default mode most people spend their lives in, or even in sympathetic dominate mode which is worse for long term health and happiness. wait at minimum of at least 3 to 4 hours between your sessions for the optimally balance.\n\nIf it was your body wouldn‚Äôt seek balance and return to homeostasis, plus it‚Äôs impossible unless you meditate all day, and from an evolutionary standpoint being in a relaxed, calm and non reactive state would get you killed, however being in a state where you are balanced would allow you to react and survive more optimally, this is my scientific opinion and to me it makes sense. Plus you feel a lot better and you still maintain the calmness and mindfulness when you allow time between sessions, so for me it‚Äôs more optimally. Im a cognitive neuroscientist so knowing the brain and nervous is my job , not saying this to be egotistical but just providing why I feel my opinion is valid and reputable, this is a subjective experience what I find to be better other may disagree.\n\nCould you expand upon this? I've noticed that for quite some time now it's as if I'm \"too chill\" for too large chunks of my day. Feels as if some periods of the day I should be more stimulated, more \"on\" but I'm just so relaxed and watered down from long deep meditation sessions that I can't be bothered.\n\nOkay I can make post if more are interested but it‚Äôs this. \nyou don‚Äôt want to meditate all the time or too frequently. \nYou nervous system needs time to stabilize  and integrate the calming effects from meditation. \nwait at least 3-4 hours between sessions in order to sustain mental and emotional balance.\nit‚Äôs better for you gains and for experiencing the effects more optimally. \nMeditation is an intense experience for your nervous system so it‚Äôs being stressed out it works both ways. \ndoing this will allow you to maintain optimally mental and emotional balance. \nI personally recommend studying neuroscience and the brain to gain your own understanding but this is all you need in this context\n\nYou can. But you need to force yourself at first. Like first playing the guitar where you must move your fingers individually, and with practice, they start to work seemingly on their own. Nothing gets done without effort.\n\nNext time you are (eg) talking to your wife, be aware of the entire environment of the conversation... her words of course, but her tones, her movements, etc. Be present in the entire process of talking and gather all the information given out in the conversation. It's a super-power.\n\nI do this as well. Anytime I'm having a conversation with someone I focus on it completely and be absorbed in it. It's a bit trippy at first but it gets easier with time.\n\nWow, makes sense. Such a good explanation, but not easy to do consistently . I will practice it thank you\n\nI meditate daily as well.  I certainly do relate with the shift from meditative state after you open your eyes. The once we go about the day we go back to being our old self.  i used to question this myself how can i stay in the meditative state through out the day and not loose mindfulness. What I learnt during my 10 days vipassana meditation course is equanimity. As long as you are alive, you can not, not have thoughts, emotions and feelings- the secret is to stay equanimous and be aware of the rising and passing of your thoughts, feelings and emotions and stay in the non-reactive state.\n\nMakes perfect sense, thank you. This is the way\n\nThere‚Äôs no difference between sitting in formal practice and the everyday tasks in your life. It‚Äôs all practice.\n\nI'm not sure what you were trying to say but I would like to say there is a difference in how you feel in a really deep meditation versus trying to do very active things.\n\nAlso, there's some ways of going about the day which can provide hefty amounts of bliss but not in that way where you're just soaking everything in and carrying along with a very clear head. There's differences between how you can feel in each one. It has to do with what your body is prioritizing, in that way, it also depends on what you want to do with your life, how you spend your days.\n\nWhat you feel in any given moment isn‚Äôt the point of meditation. If you‚Äôre chasing bliss you aren‚Äôt meditating, you‚Äôre striving. If you want to be truly aware of the present moment as it is, be right here, right now, without the overlay of interpreting how you feel.\n\nThat's suitable for some tasks during the day but for other ones you gotta take the time to process information more. \n\nThere's many different definitions of meditation and many ways of being in a \"meditative state\". One could decide they want to talk to God all day or they want to talk to deceased loved ones but to say that they cannot meditate that way just doesn't make enough sense and it's disempowering.\n\nIf people hear it this way they could get stuck in very long and drawn out questions and deliberation on what it means to actually meditate.\n\nI left a comment that describes how I think of it pretty well. I should have told u sooner.\n\nI might ask myself why is there a difference between the deep meditation versus the doing of active things?  Is that maybe just another example of a duality?\n\nMeditation is a contrivance (I am not judging it by saying that, just that it is a state we call meditation that we construct / create) - or you could say that it is compounded (has causes and conditions that support it and when those go away, so does the state we call meditation).\n\nWhy can we not bring that sate (or those causes and conditions) out into the active world?  Do we know what those causes and conditions are?  Is it useful to think about trying to do that, or is something else being pointed at when ‚Äúdoing meditation‚Äù?\n\nI have no answers for those things - but it seems to be a set of interesting questions.\n\nYou can, but there's a difference between integrating more active emotional work into things rather than keeping a really smooth and steady focus.\n\nLike if someone were to both play an instrument and also merge emotions into what they're doing. That's the main point of what I'm trying to say, you have concentration and you have your daily activities, concentrating differently makes for a different activity no matter how you slice it. \n\nIt's actually quite simple. You can have your attention more one pointed or less one pointed. There's ways which in deep meditation your attention can become more one pointed versus when you do other things. If you're juggling multiple interconnected tasks at a time then the mental processes and emotional processes start to work together differently.\n\nLike wise you can meditate with attention spread amongst many things, which is why I brought my point to that person, because it's still a meditation, you can still find benefits of all sorts with that more open focus type work. \n\nNonduality can help a lot to bring more one pointedness, having the freedom to not need to put attention into emotions for various tasks is helpful, but people can do extraordinary things and helpful things without bringing themselves so deep.\n\nIdk why people are downvoting what I said, that's really not constructive. It is possible to bring many more things to that sort of \"simplified\" level though. Expanding awareness.\n\nSometimes with some of the teachings with meditation it bogs down on many of the exciting features of concentration people could really enjoy and benefit from and it's good for people to get a broad scoop on those things so they don't feel disempowered, limited or otherwise bogged down. Some of the teachings I've read are actually really strict or based on this principle, something like \"all of your thoughts and feelings are distractions\" then \"here, now meditate and be aware of these simple functions of your body and you can eventually reach non duality\".\n\nThing is that there's stimulating activities that can bring benefits to the body, like heart brain coherence meditation, it's different because you can come into this moment specifically to release an empowered emotion and adrenaline is a significant aspect of that.\n\nIf you feel like you understand where I'm going with this then odds are you're understanding it intuitively. \n\nAs for meditation, there's so many different definitions for the term meditation you can come to realize how a vague description can help. Meditation is like the art of becoming accustomed to something. One definition is \"to become familiar with\". You can treat your day like a meditation but only some definitions have room for you to call something a meditation and at that rate the definition becomes so broad that it conflicts with meditations that can bring a variety of benefits with simple and productive approaches.\n\nI don't know what contrivance means but I think this all put together should help you to understand.\n\nA good way of slicing nonduality is that we still see through the lens of duality but that's simply how we construct an understanding of the world, no need to get involved any deeper with good/bad itself, you could say that things are more simplified if you can look at a situation and intuitively know, ok, that's someone else and this is me, but ultimately have no conflicts arise out of it. It's just a truth which you can see. Furthermore you can get out of thoughts of duality themselves, in deep meditation you're more able to concentrate so deeply that you just don't think of things that logically anymore, like a thoughtless state. The concentration brings energy into the equation but your attention could literally be on a rock and stay on a rock, that's one pointed attention. \n\nSo awareness of things can go in that way as well. \n\nHowever, my point holds strong in this very particular sense, when people are going about their day trying to see things as if they are happy and peaceful when they are not yet happy and peaceful and that's how they actually feel, they can't center on the middle path as well, they can react to duality more. Likewise someone who's real set up in nonduality can play with dualisms as they so choose, but getting hung up on it isn't an issue or as much of an issue.\n\nThat's the thing, there is a time and a place for different ways of being for different reasons which one has the liberty to take advantage of, and if you look more into those very \"strict\" teachings for lack of a better word, people who literally just do that and meditate and only meditate in terms of a spiritual path involving chakras and including the whole sum of anecdotal success reports for achieving higher levels of consciousness fall short, they can take forever and very well may never make it as far as they would like to.\n\nOne big problem is getting into this place where your energy is stuck and you're not taking the time to integrate with negative emotions and guide them in the other direction with energy, like banging your head against the wall trying to let go of things one thinks could be so simple, if they were coming from a different point of view later after balancing emotions in other ways it would not be so bad.\n\nSo, adrenaline is a big component of positive emotions, like I said, if you have stress and literally smack it the other direction, adrenaline can actually help you to change your memory, there's a lot of active things you can do so you can re experience other emotions.\n\nWe re experience emotions as if they're happening all over again, it's plentiful and useful and truthfully important for many people to prioritize this part of things. If not then people can get involved with meditation and succumb to these other comments I see about how meditation doesn't fix your problems, like they couldn't just integrate the solution to their problem into their meditations in the first place until they can get to deeper forms of concentration, of their choice.\n\nIt's silly, even in terms of chakras, one does not have to be pearly non dual to open chakras, nor do they need to feel like a blissful breeze, there can be a lot of velocity.\n\nWhen you merge emotions there can be a click. When you're good with them you can feel them like an opportunity and merge them together harder. You can listen to music and have very empowered emotions come together and flush the body with positive emotions and electromagnetic energy and all that, not just energy. There's just more to concentration in general. \n\nThe difference between actively working with emotions and being more like a breeze depends on a host of variables and it's hard to sum up, but either way it's like you learn to be rewarded for the right things at the right time and learn the ways which you can balance rewards with each other in various different paced environments.\n\nSecond thoughts\n\nI forgot to make one good solid point.\n\nlook how some people tell you to keep your attention on your object of meditation and say that is meditation right there, you are meditating, yet there are so many things you can understand things, understanding things differently can bring about a meditative state and the meditative state is like a state of relaxation.\n\nEdit: you can think of balancing emotions like subdividing in music theory, you can have multiple emotional tasks not only balanced but working with each other subconsciously, it's a brilliant way to live and for some people it works extremely well for how they would like to live, however it's very situational and it can require skill before becoming efficient and one can use up too much energy doing it, it takes a lot more wisdom to pull off very efficiently but that's not to say people can't just up and play around with it a little, I'm not trying to say it's too risky, but the approach means more and problems can come out of being too passionate.\n\nThere is a lot to absorb in those two replies.  I am left feeling like there is a flood of thoughts that I will have to read a few more times to fully take in.\n\nPlease note that my post / reply was generally posing questions and not offering any solutions or outcomes.  I don‚Äôt think those questions can be answered (pinned down) here and now - maybe they just act as points of inquiry.for me or anyone reading them, just pointing in a direction.\n\nI do ask myself about the nature of awareness in and out of the meditative states, and how does it differ from the non meditating states.  What is there a difference?  I have no answer to these questions and possibly never will, but do feel that for me in this time such questions are helpful in my practice.\n\nIn the end, the true teacher, guru, etc. is inside, not out there (using dualistic terminology to make a point in this relative existence).  A current teacher for me (a Lama in a Tibetan tradition), is very clear that he will and can never be my or anyone else‚Äôs guru.  That if one feels necessary, then go with one that is not currently living, but ultimately look internally.\n\nI am no longer trying to find grounding - some people have pointed to a notion of ‚Äúthe groundless ground‚Äù - again, just a metaphor to point in a direction to question the nature of grounding.\n\nI used to overthink things, which I think was related to my deep ned to find the answers.  For me, the degree to which I have dropped the need for answers the more open things seem to become in all states of awareness.\n\nYet in the end, I find that I am a 59yo man trying to live in the situation in which I am in and at least minimize the harm I cause to others.  I am certainly imperfect in that, so I stay on the path for now.\n\nMy only suggestion would be to try not to overthink things and let go of a need for answers.  I found that for me, the need for answers was just another form of attachment, one that I am still working on.\n\nI hear ya cap'\n\nIt can get really nitty gritty when it comes to fear of the future, but habituating into a way of being really strongly can make a lot of the nitty gritty things get really quiet because you observe them and then just go back to your way of being, oftentimes it's fear of the emotional process or some sense of ignorance that keeps it stuck. Finding that spot where you drop fear, even if only temporarily, you could come up at that sensation over and over, the way you just naturally realize something and it leads to fear. I've seen it go super duper low for me, like my body wouldn't release the same signals over things anymore, and I've also felt them come back.\n\nThere's a need express there's a deeper reason why it eventually sorta broke down a notch eventually, but when it was working I felt like my decision was already held in my heart before I ever came across the fear itself, so rather than my body gathering information to understand what it should do, it was still using information in a way I programmed into it as one that is plentiful.\n\nIt does feel really weird! Before I felt like I was just doing it and it was held in my core, i had almost absolutely no fear. I basically just had concern, which will sorta force the body to suck in energy in a similar way, it's more nitty gritty. \n\nI'm very much so the kind for the groundless ground, if u recall I meant grounding like literally grounding out electricity so it doesn't go where it's not wanted. Pressure is a pretty word, in some abstract sense the way we experience more experiences over and over automatically with desire and other aspects is like pressure in and of itself. Like there's an infinite amount of pressure you could work with. \n\nI was just participating in a post last night where someone was talking about how scientists said that when we multitask out attention essentially switches between tasks really really fast. It leaves room to wonder about how energy behaves if you focus on two hands rather than one but I'm not sure, but it is as if the movement of energy brings your attention other places when you try to hold it there. It's too complicated, I can't find a good reason to think on it, feelings are a variable, blah blah XD\n\nYup üòäüëç\n\nI inherently agree with the scientists‚Äô view you mention about task switching.  This is probably due to my computer programming background / career as that is how a single processor seems to be doing many things at once, just do one thing at a time and switch between all of them very quickly.\n\nMy sense is that my mind can only have a single focus in a given moment, but the moments are really quick and like the processor switch to whatever is next giving the illusion of simultaneous, or near simultaneous, focus.  On the other hand, the brain is also seemingly really doing all kinds of things in parallel (in keeping the body running, ‚Ä¶), but we do not seem to generally be ‚Äúaware‚Äù of those parallel background tasks.\n\nI guess I do have a model that the brain is a biological computer (or that we are mimicking what we think the brain is doing in the silicon processors).\n\nAnyway, that is getting mildly off topic, so I will stop there.\n\nYou just practice. There is no secret. No magic thing that will let you hold onto the states you encounter. Nothing but practice. In the same way that when you started, the only thing that let you meditate for fifteen minutes instead of ten minutes was practice. It is not different. Just practice.\n\nBringing yourself back to a state of mindfulness briefly throughout the day is helpful.  From a Dzogchen perspective, the state of the natural mind is refuge.  The goal isn‚Äôt to maintain a blissful state all the time; rather it is to understand and experience the natural state, take refuge daily, and have greater mental discipline through mindfulness and awareness.  I‚Äôm afraid if you are chasing the bliss, you may be missing the mark.  The goal of the Buddhist tradition, from which Dzogchen is a stream, is to be transformed through the fruits of meditation so that you are more able to live the path of the Bodhissatva.  Chasing the bliss is a bit like chasing orgasm from sex while completely overlooking the other virtues of sex, like intimacy, procreation, connection, etc. In other words, sure it is awesome, but it‚Äôs short lived and only a small part of the package.\n\nso it's about meditating more? It's not about doing something to keep practicing, while you're doing the dishes?\n\nIt is not about \"doing\" anything. It is about continuing the same stillness when you leave the mat. You stillness is generated by your breath. With practice, the same practice you have now, you carry that stillness into your whole being. Instead of practicing only when you are sitting in your specific place with your perfect ambience. Practice while doing the dishes. The same way you practice when you think it's special.\n\nSounds like what thich nhat hanh says. His teachings always resonated deeply with me\n\nHave you read the mind illuminated? I‚Äôve listened to it probably six times in the last year, now mostly in sections, and I get more out of it every time I revisit it. He talks about what you should be ‚Äúdoing‚Äù. It‚Äôs mostly just noticing subtler feelings and vibrations and deeper and deeper understanding of the bodies function and how the mind filters information, all of which lead to natural insights into reality and our role in its function.\n\nThe deeper the insight the more you relax into a natural state of calm that persists.\n\nWho wrote this book?\n\nCuladasa/John Yates\n\n&gt;*so it's about meditating more?*¬†\n\nNo. You don't need to meditate more, it won't change anything, there are things you can't rush.\n\nUPD: honestly, I even think you meditate too much as it is. I don't see the point of sitting longer than 15-20 minutes.\n\nThats not true...\n\nHa bro, I can be Buddha himself, completely in the now after a meditation with a strong focused mind and an appreciation for life, but 1 minute outside and some old lady cuts me off and I am screaming and cursing againüòÖ\n\nI think what it brings me is the ability to get back to that state faster. To not stay emotionally attached to these little annoyances and let them go faster. \n\nI think people go and live in a forest for a reason, there is no possibility to be in that great mindset all the time in a modern city.\n\nMeditation is all about your brainwaves. That‚Äôs how scientists can objectively measure whether someone is ‚Äúmeditating‚Äù or not.\n\nIf you‚Äôre actively participating in a conversation, working, or caring for your child, it requires a lot more intentional thought to do those things effectively. That means your brainwave pattern will struggle to move out of beta - our usual waking problem solving and active thinking state. \n\nThere are instances where you can move into an alpha state (aka a flow state) where you are engaged and enjoying whatever you are doing, time seems to fly by, and you seem to have boundless focus and energy. There are certain conditions for that which include doing something that you are passionate about, that you enjoy doing, that you have put a lot of time and energy into, and that isn‚Äôt boring to you - it pushes you a little bit but not enough to be frustrating.\n\nMeditation isn‚Äôt just about brain waves‚Äîit‚Äôs much more than that. While meditation does influence brain waves, it also physically changes the brain over time. Research shows that regular meditation increases the size of areas like the prefrontal cortex (focus/decision making) and the hippocampus. It also strengthens neural connections, thickens cortical regions related to awareness, and even shrinks the amygdala, which reduces stress responses. Meditation isn‚Äôt just about how your brain feels in the moment‚Äîit actually rewires and reshapes your brain for the long term.\n\nI agree with you, but my point was more that brainwaves are the barometer for whether or not you are actively meditating. You can certainly enjoy the effects of improved brain function that meditation gives you during the rest of your day but OP was asking if they can be meditating while also doing other things. It is very unlikely that that could measurably meditate during those activities because their brainwave patterns likely won‚Äôt be able to move out of beta.\n\nIncrease your meditation, which is awareness in daily life. Wandering mind is the obstacle and you're living with it every moment of your life therefore, get on with your life. Live life. But be aware where you are and to see what you're doing at the moment you are doing it, work, play, enjoyment etc. This awareness replaces wandering Thoughts for you have no time to attend to them, for you are aware of where you are and what you are doing at the moment. A guaranteed method for spiritual (inward) of awakening of inner energies.\n\nAlso practice the art of listening. When you listen to the music watching movies, listening to your wife and be aware how the mind wanders off to other thoughts therefore at that moment you're not listening, for there is interference of other thoughts.\n\nYour progress can be measured by how how quickly you catch the mind wandering and bringing it back (awareness of unawareness is awareness) to its original natural state and regain its composure and acts differently when different thoughts will  start appearing. For those thoughts won't be a product of memory  but something entirely new and you'll be astonished. It will take a while to find that gap.\n\nBe mindful when you‚Äôre doing daily tasks. Bring yourself back to the present moment or even your breath any time you notice your mind‚Äôs wandering. Eventually you‚Äôll cultivate more and more mindfulness that will carry over into your daily life.¬†\n\n40 minutes is not enough to last the whole day. Ramp it up to 2h and your result will skyrocket. The result is exponentially proportional to the during and quality of your sitting periods. 3-4h s optimal but not so easy if you have a very busy life.\n\nIf you want the permanent version go for ‚Äústream entry‚Äù. A lot of resources online.\n\nThink of the supreme being throughout the day and carry your actions with the love of the supreme being in mind. Surrender the results of your and other actions to him. Do not place expectations on results or others. Let it be.\n\nMeditation for me is a reminder to be mindful throughout the day, and practice in seeing things through a lens of equanimity. \n\nIt takes a lot of practice to remain mindful and present, and to avoid ego reactions, but you get better at it as you go. \n\nUnless you live on a monastery, your probably not going to remain mindful at all times, but it‚Äôs a great feeling when you catch yourself reacting out of habit thinking and return to a more mindful state.\n\n&gt; I wish to be able to call forth this kind of mental state\n\nWhat is this mental state? How does it feel? How much detail can you accurately describe it with? Really stop and take a moment to do this. Whatever you‚Äôve got is good.\n\nNow, what is *not* this mental state? Everything else? Again, take a moment to detail the feelings that are not it.\n\nThen, as you go about daily tasks, particularly the things you can do on autopilot, practice noticing the stray feelings that might signal either the desired state or not the desired state. Just practice noticing.\n\nIn my experience, new noticings come well after the fact. Like, ‚ÄúOh, that‚Äôs right, I felt that thing earlier when such and such happened.‚Äù That‚Äôs great, and normal. If you have someone to talk with about it, extra great, if not, voicing our most important observations aloud can be wildly effective all the same. Then just keep noticing earlier each time, and you‚Äôll slowly bring your current reality in line with the desired reality.\n\nLastly, I find it especially helpful to frame my goals based entirely on needs. I said ‚Äúdesired state‚Äù just before and desire is a want, which is the root of all suffering, yada yada. I absolutely, 100% believe that, so framing your goals with need and practicing that regularly will naturally align your wants with your needs, and then desire is neutralized. Huzzah!!\n\nOk, go get ‚Äòem tiger!\n\nI've found that when I practice visualization meditations and visualize a calm setting (forest, temple, whatever!) in my mind, I can easily return there throughout the day. If I focus and take some deep breaths, I can tap back into the feeling!\n\nI would suggest that you work with energy to do that.\n\nI've spent some time, not in a critically acclaimed state but with many hours worth of bliss, 50 or 60 in a week, I could close my eyes and feel taken by the bliss rather than, like, normal. Like I'd close my eyes and that's enough to bring it in, like it came to get me, like being assaulted by bliss.\n\nI suggest you meditate every day and get the other biological upgrades, the way the size of your brain structures change, the hefty increases in gamma brainwave potential. There's a big difference between bliss and BLISS. \"Perfect happiness\" is not a good definition for bliss, I understand what it means but one can do better and better.\n\nIt's like all americanized on my version of google or whatever I should call it. Not that I'm having an issue with that.\n\nHeart brain coherence meditation is a good way to make improvements quickly. 15-20 minutes is extremely effective and faster than mindfulness for a lot of really important aspects.\n\nI would choose to spend my day in a form of loving kindness as opposed to finding my own inner light of consciousness and having it just go and go, either way you can also go and integrate that feature of existence at a later date but that's just my choice, if I were to pick between one or the other I'd choose to have the potential for both.\n\nRealistically, it's just silly. You can be blissful while being conscious of your thoughts and feelings and learn to do so and stay in that state and have new feelings get habituated along with that feeling, the thing is it uses up energy and you can't just stay like that all day.\n\nDoes that make sense? When you're in deep meditation there's a time you come to when you start to process information differently and some people can notice it better than others because it is most clear when you can sit there and realize you're in the same kinds of stories but things organize differently.\n\nWhen you concentrate you can feel a feeling that feels still with sensations around it and coming out of it, it's basically sorta still but what's actually still around here.\n\nAnyways, when you get deeper into meditation there is a place where you integrate and release information. It's like receiving and producing or giving. It's a strange thing.\n\nYou can think of the brain like a computer, you can have many emotions and thoughts going in tandem and subjectively some of them can feel more like a background process than others.\n\nYou can learn to have that feeling that feels still but you're certainly probably NOT going to go into very low theta or delta brainwaves while walking, I've heard some yogis are capable of resting in theta but it's a huge achievement, in that way you will feel different walking around through the day. You can still have that feeling that feels still but it all processes a bit differently than when you're in deep meditation.\n\nThe feeling is like a background process and when you have negative emotions you can learn to feel them like they're a background process much more often as well, like they're happening but you're still focused on your task and you don't react to it emotionally. At this rate the body can get better and better at producing positive emotions.\n\nAll sorts of meditation can bring you into that way of being and you can also take that way of being and integrate it into something like listening to music and take the bliss that is possible in that still like feeling and learn to slip on more and more adrenaline and more and more emotional processes and find that you can balance them in many different ways. It's kinda hard to describe, it's like finding a different mode of thinking and learning to have it intermingle. \n\nAdrenaline is a significant component of profound positive emotions and while you learn to be this way your body learns to just commit to things and doesn't waste it's potential on things you don't need.\n\nIt can start off feeling still, sometimes you can feel an emotion make it feel a bit more active for a bit and then go back down, you don't have to think about it and many meditations ask you to pay attention to other things while remaining aware of the rest of things, at which rate you have multiple ways of integrating ideas and like a computer there's many ways for you to process information as according to the way you would like to feel.\n\nEdit: excuse me, I tend to forget this part. The feelings can intermingle funny because they're merging together in various ways. That's why it can feel a bit different depending on what you're up to.\n\nI am not sure tbh. when I go too deep while running I collapse. It is possible to stay in a shallow meditative state why doing daily stuff which you can try to gradually deepen. I did this for a few years though an entity helped me in it. I am pretty sure though it is possible to learn on your own, e.g. you do sitting meditation and next time you do standing meditation, next time walking meditation, etc. It requires practice, but certainly possible. Another thing I did is staying in the present e.g. observing every step, move, etc. I do and I did especially when I accidentally touched something. It requires real effort, but it is possible too.\n\nThe Buddha actually had this problem before he became the Buddha. He went to the brahmins, their rituals didn't help, the ascetics, whose extreme abstinence didn't help, and the meditators, who seemed to help but only while he was engaged in meditation. I guess it goes without saying that he found a solution and it was the Middle Path. Or the Noble Eightfold path. Same path.\n\nOsho says to always stay in awareness‚Ä¶ be aware in every moment.\n\n\"yoga off the mat\" so to speak.\n\nOnce the mind is stilled during practice, how to then maintain that Peace of mind out there, through all of life's activities and endeavors, such that every moment becomes infused with presence?\n\nAnchoring on the breath helps me out considerably when I can remember to return to conscious breathing throughout the day.  \n  \nMantra practice is another technique which helped me considerably, and I can attest it works when practiced for a sustained period of time, rendering the mind in a generally more quiescent state, enabling presence to be sustained.  Mantra gives your mind something to rest upon, so it doesn't go running amok.  At least, that's been my experience.    \n  \nCombining the two - mantra with conscious breathing, whenever and wherever possible, throughout the day (even throughout the body) seems to be relatively effective with respect to many (but not all) of the triggers the external world has to offer on a moment to moment basis, all competing to distract.  \n\nIn a nutshell,   \nBreathe,  \nImagine peace (or suitable mantra),  \nand feel the earth with your feet wherever your travels may take you.\n\nI recommend practicing beliefchanging aka dreamchamging aka spells aka magick in addition to meditation. Your concentration abilities will come in handy. I practice the [old Hawaiian style](https://shamanblog.com/the-haipule) but there are also buddhist, hindu and christian flavored versions. Then more good things happen and your thought patterns also don't drag them into the negative. Do both and you've got it licked.\n\nYou are chasing a chimera, a cultivated state.  It is just a conversation you are having with yourself which you enjoy.  States are not meditation.  Meditation is your whole existence, good and bad and ugly.  Open the aperture out.  You have gone deep, but not wide.  Time to start to notice the meditation in frustration, lack, anger, laughter, trees and grasses.\n\nI meditate all the time while doing things.  For example, there is walking meditation where the focus is on my walk, my body walking, and the feelings that walking brings on.  It is a mindfulness meditation.  Others are calming meditation where I reflect on a stored calming experience and use it to help me in meetings, while driving, or dealing with some difficult situation.  Repetitive or mundane tasks can become a meditative practice for one's journey.\n\nOver the past 50+ years of meditating mindfullness meditation and focus meditation have become second nature in my life.  However, I still practice new ways of meditating as I continue my life journey.\n\nBest wishes for you on your journey and remember it is your practice so make it yours.\n\nWorking and walking meditation. Stay mindful doing all that you do during the day. That is the goal at least.\n\nTo answer your question as directly as I possibley can, meditation isn't a singular act you participate in, it's a mindset and way of viewing existence. \n\nIn my experiences, meditation is about obtaining and mainintaining perspective on existence. The structuctured activies such as guided meditation apps, breathing exercises, yoga, etc are all great ways of practicing and training yourself, but that's just the begining, and it's can be helpful to apply those skills in all aspects of life.\n\nTo paraphrase a Budhist text the act of meditation is like teaching a starving man his house is made of gold. He can recognize the value around him, but He can't eat his walls.\n\nInstead, He needs to learn how to take the gold around him and refine it so he can trade it for food he can eat to survive.\n\nIt's the application of those meditation practices to all of your existence that is like refining those golden walls into something we can use.\n\nTo be even more specific, use the grounding strategies, breathing techniques, nom-judgemental acceptance of your current state of being, being an obaerver of your thoughts and letting them go where they take you, and all of the individual things you do during your formal meditation practice, and apply it to literally any and all aspscts of your life. \n\nAnother more concrete, but still metaphoric example from that text I paraphrased earlier is, learn to focus on everything in your surroundings instead of just a singular point. For example, look out into the horizon and up into the sky. When you do thar, you're not looking at anything in particular, you kinda just take it all in. Sometimes you may notice the way a certain cloud looks, or an airplane go by, but chances are you aren't focusing on anyone particular thing the way you do when you go through your daily lifs looking straigjt ahead. Train yourself to take that type of perspective on all of existence, especially outside of your formal meditation practice. So for example, if you're driving to work listening to music, really feel the moment and embrace it completely. How does each note sound? How does it feel? What does your body feel in response to the drum beat? Do the lyrics make you feel anything in particular or remind you of previous events? What I mean is, being present in the moment isn't just about sitting quitely with a quite mind. It's recognizing and participatinf in the moment with whatever is happening inside and outside of you. \n\nIf you're interested, I can specify more with actual concrete practices, or more specific, but abstract concepts and applications of anyone is interested.\n\nEdit: To go even further, what do you think is rhe difference in yourself or your outlook between your practice and \"daily life off the meditation cushion\"? That's not meant to be rhetorical. Seriously consider that question and reflect on what the differences are between the two. And in doing so hopefully you'll be able to realize for yourself the answer to your question and what you need to do to bridge the gap between the two, if there even is a gap that needs to be bridged.\n\nMeditation needs to be paired with mindfulness. No, you likely can't go through your day in a meditative trance. You can go through daily activities mindfully bringing meditative poise, presence, and insight to moment to moment activities and interactions. Meditation. Is not about \"feeling good\" but being truly conscious on and off the mat.\n\nA consistent meditation practice will eventually cause you to call in these types of questions, which is a sign that your practice is actually taking hold. Our minds can be healing from conditioned beliefs that if we are not perfect at something quickly or always, we are not effective. Meditation is like strength training to better our mindsets to a more consistent,  zen like state. As that practice grows, clearing these questions and having these internal conversations will continue to lead you through the place/state of mind that is keeping you from being able to work in synch with you emotions well enough to bring forward these balanced, relaxed states as you need them.\n\nMy experience with this similar phase was when I began to realize that these exact frustrations were the exact questions to ask myself. When you step into your next meditation, ask yourself one of these questions and allow whatever comes forward to guide you. Even if the response seems logically unrelated, exploring what feedback  (listen to the thoughts that follow the question without attachment to what you're hearing) returns from as many open minded perspectives as possible can aid in painting an expanded awareness of your experience and allow you to be present in moments without such weighted stress.\n\nGood luck out there!\n\nStop clinging\n\nHave you opened your third eye yet? Once you open your third eye and keep meditating on it every day, you start to feel blissful all day long, no matter what you are doing üíï‚ò∫Ô∏è\n\nThere is mainly two kind of meditatjon. Samatha and Vippasana. The one that you do is Samatha, it develops calmness and peace. This is important to improve mindfulness. After you have mindfulness, you can develop the second one. The second one is Vippasana, it develops WISDOM. \n\nWisdom of understanding that:\n1. Nothing is permanent in this whole universe and everything is a subject to change. \n2. Nothing can be controlled.\n3. If you can not accept the two above and want it the other way, it will create suffering. \n\nYou WANT to be peaceful all the time and you can't accept that it is not permanent and uncontrollable. So you suffer.\n\nTry to develop wisdom by seeing all thing as impermanent and uncontrollable. The peace from insight by accepting all things as impermanent and uncontrollable is much deeper. Someone who understand and accept that everything is impermanent and uncontrollable is the one who is free from suffering.\n\nEvery time you stand up or sit down, be aware of it. \n\nIt is nearly impossible to do though in my experience. I‚Äôve maybe done it twice, ever. But that is the theory. Lol\n\nIt‚Äôs really just about doing 40 min a day, every day, for a year or two, or however long it takes.\n\nDrink beer\n\nYou might find r/StreamEntry interesting and useful.\n\nZen saying. Before enlightenment chop wood, carry water. After enlightenment chop wood, carry water. Meditation practice changes from ly    s  us oor even day to day. Life is the same. And Buddhist meditation is not to bliss out but to become acquainted with the nature of mind and to train it. Equanimity is a by product. Carry that into your life while you chop wood and carry water. Be curious. Be kind. Be well\n\nIn Buddhism you open up a file and ask questions and put answers into that file. When you ask a question you open a new file and it's empty at first. I've asked this question my whole spiritual life and I'm not sure I have great answers except intensifying, meditating a lot, I build up mindfulness. My baseline rises, and my peaks go up and up. If you go on retreat, and watch the mindfulness fade away when you return, what does that mean? The rubber band snaps back. Would you go insane keeping up that mindfulness in your regular work a day life? How easy is it to change your lifestyle with mindfulness the priority? You can see why people become monks, right? The path is hard and you need friends and other support, and might not just be for \"functioning better\" as a worldling. The tradition in Buddhist countries is to go for it after the children leave the house. It's interesting you're wanting more, isn't it?\n\nLonger sessions can lead to a deeper states and a longer after glow.\n\nI didn't start getting deep enough that I hit the jhanas until I was doing 2 hour meditation sessions.\n\nLonger sessions most people can't do every day.  That's okay.  Do it when you've got the time and the mood to enjoy it.  My practice involved reading koans then meditating 2-3 hours 1 to 2 times a week.\n\nI dropped formal sitting practice a while back. It was just temporary. I didn't have time in the day to do anything, let alone practice, as I had some work stuff that was demanding 16-18 hour days. Anyway, during this period I made everything I did my practice, especially if it was a repetitive task like making food, showering, and the drive to work. I think it comes down to what Dogen said about \"removing the barrier between oneself and all things, such that one's No Mind penetrates deeper and deeper into ones daily life endlessly.\" That was the answer for me. I was forced to stop sitting. But yea, like others said here, you can widen the circle of your practice by including other activities. It helps hearing it from others. People do this. It's just a matter of setting your intention. There's really nothing special about it, no formal way with rules and whatever.\n\nCarry aspects of meditation over into everyday life. A lot of human daydreaming is focus on and embellishment of negative thoughts. Some years ago I found that was happening to me often while driving alone. I then simply refused to expand on the negative thoughts that popped up, and could drive at great peace without impatience.\n\nCould be this:\n\nInitially, as you stay in a state of allowing, you can get some sudden glimpse of this space of wholeness ‚Äì they can be enjoyable experiences, but they are just fleeting glimpse or fore-tastes. Just having fleeting glimpses doesn‚Äôt serve you much in ‚Äúliving‚Äù, except to indicate to you that there is a different domain that needs to be explored. The reason that you only get fleeting glimpses is because there is a layer of separation created by the momentum of negativity in your emotional and mental space ‚Äì in fact, the layers run deep due to accumulation of the past. Unless you make away with most of these layers, you can‚Äôt find a permanent grounding in this space of wholeness. \n\nSource - https://www.calmdownmind.com/a-natural-patience/\n\nBut your mind will always be there, that‚Äôs the design.\n\nWhat's your practice? Intentionally repeat micro versions of it throughout the day.\n\nIf it's breath awareness, maintain it throughout the day. If it's body scans, do them throughout the day. If it's the repetition of mantras or affirmations, repeat them throughout the day. If it's concentrating all of your focus on a single point, think of the object or actually glance at it as many times as you can throughout the day and bring your attention back to it. If it's open awareness, maintain mindfulness and a silent witness perspective throughout the day. \n\nIt need not be perfect, and you can do it for a few minutes every hour.\n\nI've begun writing my Sankalpa on my palm so I don't forget what it is.\n\n[https://c8.alamy.com/comp/EM8DH9/to-do-written-on-the-palm-of-a-hand-photographed-against-a-black-background-EM8DH9.jpg](https://c8.alamy.com/comp/EM8DH9/to-do-written-on-the-palm-of-a-hand-photographed-against-a-black-background-EM8DH9.jpg)\n\nMeditation combined with microdose = prolonged mindfulness. \nAlso no need to meditate for as long meditation is still key tho as they both enhance each other\n\nMichael Singer teachings have been a gamechanger for me in this very aspect you're talking about. To me meditation always felt like a drug in the sense that you just came back to normal after a while. You're chilling and then you open a stressful email or whatever and there goes your calm state\n\nI recommend you his books The Untethered Soul and Living Untethered (specially the second one) and also his podcast on soundstrue is great. Also Letting Go by David Hawkins. What they teach is basically healing our emotional blocks from the root\n\nIt sounds like you‚Äôre practicing Samatha meditation. Where you have one object that you try to centre your mind on, e.g., the breath. \n\nSamatha is good for developing concentration and temporarily subduing the 5 hindrances - which is why you feel peaceful, the hindrances stop arising as much when you centre your mind. \n\nBut for lasting, long term peace you need to practice vipassana. It‚Äôs not pleasant like samatha in the short run, but it is the establishment of mindfulness that will effect a real change and bring you lasting peace through the sattipatana vipassana. After all, the buddha said the path out of suffering is the establishment of mindfulness, sattipatana vipassana is the establishment of mindfulness. \n\nI used to practice samatha - not knowing it was samatha - but I started vipassana 6 months ago and went on a retreat about 3 weeks ago and it my life, personality and well being have completely changed. People even comment on it in my waking life. Before I was depressed, ate lots of food, felt like I was walking against a 100mph headwind of aversion whenever I did any task and frankly just wanted to die. I joined a buddhist comminity called sirimangalo on discord, which is run by actual monks (they hosted the retreat I attended), i took their online vipassana course and was meditating 2 hours a day. My life now compared to 6 months ago is incomparable, i‚Äôm a completely different person. Before I was full of anger and hatred, doubt, worry, aversion and laziness, but practicing mindfulness (satipatanna vipassana) has reversed my life. I‚Äôm finally letting go of the darkness that took root in my heart, I‚Äôm more generous, compassionate and want others to be happy. \n\nNow, you can still practice samatha. But if you want to uproot your hindrances for good, you must practice vipassana. Every day. I recommend the Sirimangalo community if you don‚Äôt know where to begin.\n\nVery good point, I haven‚Äôt been able to achieve that either\n\nPay attention, don‚Äôt cling, and be kind. Take every opportunity to be of service to your family and everyone you encounter in life. It‚Äôs in giving that we receive the benefits of our spiritual practice.¬†\n\nMan, there are a lot of factors and variables involved in achieving this state on a \"permanent\" basis (if you can call it that). Personally, I partially agree with some of the comments here that say you can't maintain it all the time. It depends a lot, but in reality, it's quite difficult. And even if you can, the most you can achieve is a *percentage* of this ecstasy, never in a total and continuous way.\n\nFirstly, time and consistency of practice are fundamental. The more you meditate, the more it will integrate into your reality, and your brain will enter frequencies such as alpha or theta more easily.\n\nThe second point is how you approach everyday life. Your reactions, impulses and even whether you feel fulfilled in what you do have a direct impact. If you don't maintain principles such as resilience, ethics and emotional balance, it's impossible to sustain any benefit from meditation outside of it.\n\nAnd finally, even if you do all this, everyday life requires an active mind. There's no way to be in a state of bliss while solving problems or dealing with practical tasks. But you can anchor those feelings of calm and fullness that meditation brings and apply them throughout the day. That already makes an absurd difference.\n\nIn short, there's no \"eternal bliss\", but you can build a state of serenity that helps you live better. It's more about integrating practice into real life than trying to escape it.\n\nPut your full attention on the action\n\nAccepting the impermanence and that nothing lasts forever and that there is no feel good forever no bad feelings hack to life. Pain and suffering are facts of life, running from it causes further suffering. You can get glimpses of it by watching the breathe all day but outside of retreat/a monastery (and even there monks get into drama within their orders) that‚Äôs a tough task for westerners to pull off. Doesn‚Äôt hurt to give it a try though. when you feel yourself losing your peace you can try taking a moment  to separate the thoughts from the feelings and just feel the breathe coming in and out.\n\nUr negative emotions will be brought on to the surface u have observe it eventually there will be a change in you\n\n[removed]\n\nWe do not allow self posts with links from new members.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Meditation) if you have any questions or concerns.*\n\nmeditate every day.\n\nI totally understand what you're saying. It's one of my goals. Can you watch your thoughts come and go when you meditate undisturbed? Later in the day can you watch your cravings come and let them go just like a thought and still feel content? You would need to totally revamp your lifestyle into something that is shaped and modeled by your meditation technique.\n\nThe only way you can achieve this is by having constant meditation sessions daily but there‚Äôs no time for this and plus you aren‚Äôt even living life at that point what‚Äôs the point of all that meditating if you aren‚Äôt living life to experience the benefits of all that meditation.\n\nTrust me you‚Äôre doing great and you should meditate every morning for 40 minutes like you‚Äôve already been doing, you‚Äôll notice you have great control over emotions and are more mindful of your thoughts and feelings and you can calm down faster after being stressed or anxious, these are the immediate benefits but as I mentioned the long term benefits and structural brain changes are what it‚Äôs really about, good luck and I hope this helps.\n\nThe goal is to be liberated from samsara. So do that."

Beatle John, Yoko's husband, a father, a celebrity, a peace activist...removing each \"suit\" one by one until there was \"just John.\" And then he could sleep.\n\nDo you have some link? So that I can refer\n\nsmall and easy practices like these are gold, thanks for sharing\n\nI used to imagine that I'm just a soul, piece of light that just got this body to live in, and all the circumstances to \"gather\" since I am here. From there I would just try to feel like a piece of light with none of that attached, which maybe sounds hard but you'll se it just comes naturally (no wonder hahahaha) and it feels nice\n\nI saw this in a Sadh-guru YouTube video.. i understand we are not all these things, everything is energy. But how do u consciously keep everything aside.. give me some tips üòÅ\n\nI generally just remember all things which I consider important like body, mind my loved ones and just remind myself that these things are mine but they are not me\n\nNice.. thank u üòä\n\nYes .. that is what we do when we meditate‚Ä¶ we temporarily set aside all our worldly thoughts ‚Ä¶ our environment.. our problems ‚Ä¶ our worldly interests so we can be just alone ‚Ä¶ even forgetting who we are ‚Ä¶it is in this state that we enter a psychic state of consciousness free of all earthly limitations.. and eventually we come to sense the unity and love that pervades all things ‚Ä¶ \n\n.. so strangely going into a place of isolation opens our consciousness to our true nature which is one with all ‚Ä¶where we partake of the love .. harmony.. unity and power ‚Ä¶. and going through a similar but  briefer period just before sleep puts us in a similar period of attunement while we sleep .. and waking up greatly refreshed !\n\nArticle is good to read as well :) \n\n[https://isha.sadhguru.org/magazine/forest-flower/2024/4/awakening-to-exuberance--practical-steps-to-shedding-your-mental-baggage.html](https://isha.sadhguru.org/magazine/forest-flower/2024/4/awakening-to-exuberance--practical-steps-to-shedding-your-mental-baggage.html)\n\nThank you\n\nThis is so crazy, I accidentally clicked on this as I was scrolling before bed.\n\nI've literally had these weird thoughts as I'm going to sleep, the realization that I am only me at the end of this life, just as I entered it...\n\nNothing to add, other than thank you for the post!\n\nThat's awesome:)\n\nYou mean put them on your bedside table and leave them there until morning? Or go to sleep,thinking about them?\n\nYess  put them beside\n\nI'll be trying this tonight.\n\nPeter Crone digs deep right thru this to give the same message. We are all light and vibration and while jettisoning the accumulated burden has been hard for me I‚Äôll try the suggested practices here for sure\n\nI never heard of him before but I will look into it thanks!\n\nI really love this. I just tried it and I felt instantly soothed! Thank you.\n\nThank you for sharing! I‚Äôve been struggling with attachment to outcomes and what I can and have achieved. Gonna try this for a week and see if it helps!"

    "all_comment_text": "Lets be honest if meditation didnt do anything no one would do it. the studys show meditation does all these things. otherwise might as well start clash of clans meditation as a form a meditation\n\nI see where you‚Äôre coming from but you must have misinterpret what I stated.  I‚Äôm not saying meditation doesn‚Äôt have benefits or that studies showing its effectiveness aren‚Äôt valid. But the more you fixate on those benefits‚Äîtrying to force something specific to happen‚Äîthe more you actually miss the essence of meditation. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüóø\n\nPersonally, I get where you're coming from. Meditation isn't the means to an end, it is the end in itself. I also have listened to a lot of Allan Watts as well. \n\nI find life beautiful when I have a regular meditation practice, life feels much more real, I am present there to taste the food, listen to the music, listen to what my friends and family have to say and I am also there for the inevitable suffering that comes with life, but it is all life, and I feel like I am not going through it in a daze at least, like a drunk. I used to be a massive overthinker and I feel like I have skipped years of my life in which I basically did little except thunked and browsed.\n\nHey but now , you‚Äôre present with it and that‚Äôs all that matters. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüóø\n\nSeconded, for what it's worth\n\nI think I understand where you are coming from, it‚Äôs a beginner thought. Something in their life is causing unhappiness or discontentment and they are seeking a cure which is great, meditation can help with that and as a byproduct it will help with many other things as well. But, it isn‚Äôt the meditation that is changing things, it‚Äôs the tool being used, the one changing things is the person using that tool. It‚Äôs the work being done inside the mind that cures the ailments and can only be achieved through the discipline and openness you have when you approach the process. I think in the most surface level answer is yes, it can fix you, it can cure things, but while on the journey you see it was you fixing things all along, but that‚Äôs a beautiful part of the experience. Thank you for provoking this thought in me this morning.\n\nnah thats just gatekeepy qualification\n\nI guess ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\n\nMost popular meditation is borrowed from Buddhism, where it's part of a structured mind training system on the path of enlightenment. Western scientists have taken it out of context to see whether it can lower blood pressure, help with insomnia, etc. They find what they look for.\n\nSimilarly, Western psychotherapists have adopted meditation as a hip adjunct to talk therapy. They also find what they look for.\n\nIt's true that some meditation techniques can help with focus problems, insomnia, etc. But the effect is mostly just a superficial result of slowing down the speed of discursive mind. In the long run, results will not be dependable because those goals are not the point. In some cases people may begin to feel worse because they've become more aware of their discursive speed and didn't really want to know.\n\nThere's a traditional analogy of picnicking next to a waterfall. At first it seems idyllic. Then at some point you notice the terrific racket of the falling water. Once you notice, it's hard to stop noticing. With meditation that means that you become more aware of the constant, nonsensical looping of sex fantasies, money anxiety, plans, regrets, and so on. It can begin to feel like you're being dragged around by your own halfwit mind.\n\nThen what? You just wanted to be better at crossword puzzles and to fret less. The technique that was supposed to make you feel better has led you into deeper waters. Woops.... You may never experience that. You may just continue to experience calmness from meditation. Some people do. But you should understand that research scientists are not meditation experts. They merely see -- or don't see -- what they look for.\n\nI was at a talk many years ago by Dr. Herbert Benson. He was a cardiologist who explored basic meditation to lower blood pressure and ended up writing a bestseller called The Relaxation Response(R). At the talk someone asked him how he deals with the psychological effects of meditation. Benson impatiently answered that anyone with mental problems should see a psychiatrist. As the saying goes, when a pickpocket mets a Zen master, all he sees is pockets. The same goes for PhD neuroscientists.\n\nI grew up in a buddist country. its not the scientests that ruin it its the new age western gurus and wanna be gurus like op who ruin it. im sorry im just speaking the truth\n\nI don't disagree. New Age has been a fad for decades and there will always be charlatans. And yes, the OP is one of the many people here who like to hold forth as experts, without any training. Some people just like to be teachers, even if they don't know anything.\n\nBut today in the West, science and psychotherapy (which tries to be a science) is a bigger threat because it's distorting and diluting the Dharma on a large, mainstream scale. 30 years ago the problem was wacky gurus talking about astral projection. Today the problem is more about pop psychotherapy usurping Buddhist methods within a self development paradigm. \n\nWe have lots of people meditating to increase focus or even as a kind of mental aerobics, trying to get a mental \"6-pack\" by adding meditation to their workout routine. (The Calm(R) app used to show a cartoon of a brain lifting weights. The cartoon brain gets more hunky the more days in a row you play a Calm(R) recording.:) \nWe even have HR departments pushing meditation to increase worker productivity. And there are lots of legit Buddhist practitioners who have prematurely decided to hang out their shingle. I know one who started a kind of retail \"meditation gym\" in NYC.\n\nOn the one hand, we could say that probably anyone who's serious and has the karma to find a teacher, will do so. On the other hand, all of this pseudo-scientific gibberish is creating a confusing landscape. If you think that meditation is meant to help you focus because scientists have studies measuring neurotransmitter levels and blood pressure, then you've fallen for the spiritual quackery of scientism.\n\nthat is true. very few people care about empathy and compassion, something strikes me wrong about this forum I wonder if they are even meditating properly or maybe thats just the american way, its all about the big cheese. maybe it ends up being a game of telephone because I havent grown up here.\n\nYou're in a forum on \"meditation\". That can be anything. People here are doing all sorts of things, including cellphone apps, Wim Hof, Culadasa, Sam Harris, trying to open their \"3rd eye\" or astral project, etc. There are a number of Buddhist Reddit groups if you want to really discuss Buddhism. (I come to this group mainly to offer information to people who are searching, in hopes of helping people to save time and effort.)\n\nI don't think this has much to do with being American. Isn't there misunderstanding of the Dharma everywhere? Personally I spent several years pursuing New Age, Theosophy, psychology, etc. I worked with what I had. It was a sincere search for some kind of wisdom. The US, especially, has developed into a \"consumer\" society. So people do tend to expect to be able to shop for and buy what they seek. But we all have to start somewhere.\n\nThat's OK. If they're truly seeking then eventually they'll refine their search. A Buddhist is not someone with perfect compassion and wisdom. If we judge in that way then it's merely competitiveness. \n\nI used to have a friend who grew up upper class in India and went to Harvard. He liked to make fun of me for practicing Buddhism. For him it was simpleminded. He explained that in India there's a fakir or a guru on every corner, but the people are starving. That led him to the conclusion that spirituality is a scam for the simpleminded. So he collected prestige and money, happy to have moved to what he regarded as the center of civilization.\n\nSeen in that light, American indulgence can be seen as potentially analogous to the party life of young Shakyamuni/Gautama. My Indian friend grew up idealizing modern technology. The life of success was ahead of him. We Americans are immersed in it. But it still doesn't do anything to address life questions. Masses of Americans are anxious, panicky, turning to pop psychology and happy pills. That gives us the luxury of being able to question whether newer rockets and 12 flavors of Oreo cookies are really the secret to a happy life. I think of that as my precious human birth: I was born into something like Shakyamuni's youth, at a time when great masters were beginning to learn English and come to the West, while pioneering Americans were going East to seek out teachers.\n\nI grew up in a family with meager resources, yet when I later travelled I realized that I was still better off than 95% of the world. I had a choice to go to college and have any career, as a reasonably educated American. That provided me the luxury to question my priorities. What is a career? Did I want to be an indentured servant to a high status job merely so that I could have a big house? That's a lot of what the hippie phenomenon was about in the 60s/70s. Young people with the life of Reilly, who were nevertheless anxious, started to look deeper. That's the beginning of the search. Even the Buddha was a spoiled young brat starting out. Even the Buddha stumbled around, trying things like extreme asceticism.\n\nYour point ?\n\nmy point is nonexistent\n\nI see what you did there. üëÄ\n\nSense it makes ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\n\nType shi , wise move\n\nYeah, OP missed the point completely.\n\nOk care to explain said point im missing ?\n\nHe said to stop striving for the effects or a particular outcome then only we can attain the meditative state. It is a paradox. To let go the effort and let it happen to you.¬†\n\nIt helps if you think of those things that meditation does as a by-product of the meditation rather than the goal. If you think of them as the goal, then you've become goal-oriented, and it will hinder your meditation efforts. In fact I think of meditation as an effortless effort. It's definitely an effort, but one in which you don't push or use force. You follow the instructions, but you follow them softly and gently. When your mind inevitably goes off of the object of the meditation you kindly and gently bring it back. Just keep repeating. If you feel impatient, observe that feeling rather than being hijacked by it.\n\nI meditate to relieve stress and it works just fine. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with using meditation for specific scientifically-proven benefits. Just know that you won‚Äôt see instant changes over night.\n\nI think he's getting at the paradox that when you try to meditate in order to achieve a specific outcome, you end up worse off. So many people meditate to reduce stress, but you can see by their posts that they are becoming stressed over whether or not they are meditating \"correctly\".\n \nAm I doing it right. It isn't working. I can't do this.\n \nThese are all mental traps people fall into when they meditate with an intention in mind. Being less stressed is a side effect of meditation. Meditation brings you fully into the here and now, which is why people become less stressed when they meditate\n\nI get that. Maybe because I can get a deep quality meditation every time, and intrusive ‚Äúam I doing it right‚Äù thoughts aren‚Äôt an issue, I can use it more like a reliable tool to work towards a goal. Like an exercise routine to achieve the goal of fitness. I can have a goal of spiritual fitness. \n\nI think the problem is people come to meditation with certain expectations, they get overwhelmed by the different techniques, and they don‚Äôt see immediate gratification towards their goals.\n\nI think OP is right in that it can be counterproductive in those instances. But I think it‚Äôs also productive to be able to mindfully have a goal and work towards it and understand that meditation can help you get there.\n\nU get it üóø\n\nI'm just something the universe is doing in a place called here and now. I love me a good Alan Watts talk\n\nJust as the trees tree, the ocean waves and the universe peoples.\n\nI agree OP.  Meditating to relieve anxiety has never really worked for me‚Ä¶ the anxiety is there to tell me something and trying to force it to go away by meditating sometimes makes it worse.\n\nAND‚Ä¶. I meditate when I am feeling anxious, because usually that is a sign that my body/soul/energy/spirit guides are trying to speak to me‚Ä¶ and when I pause, listen, and acknowledge, the anxiety disappears.  So while it isn‚Äôt a direct goal, the letting go of anxiety is a by product of meditating for me.\n\nOP, what you may not realize is that in your very post stating that there should be no goals, you have a quote that contains a goal - ‚Äúto be completely engaged with life‚Äù. \nThat‚Äôs an aspiration. If you say just do it to do it, then why would anyone bother to do it? \n\nNow I would agree that something like ‚Äúwill meditation help me get a Ferrari?‚Äù is not a skillful goal for meditation. I don‚Äôt believe in the whole ‚Äúthink about it enough and it will come to you‚Äù sort of thing. \nHowever, meditation is good for improving happiness in a multitude of ways. What I think you‚Äôre pointing at is that if your meditation is characterized by striving for a specific outcome, this will likely inhibit your meditation. \n\nThis is a subtle subject so it can be hard to talk about. It‚Äôs not that one should not have happiness goals or aspirations for improving their lives. It‚Äôs more that one should not be gripped by craving or aversion in their practice. Meditating in order to escape something is not likely to work so far. Meditating to acquire something you are craving, not going to work so well. Meditating to be free of craving and aversion? Right on. Meditating so you can learn to be fully engaged with your life and thus be happier, suffer less, and be more skillful in relationships and action in the world? Right on.\n\nWell I interpret his quote as just a life lesson , an advice , you take it as you will. It‚Äôs not ‚Äúaspiring ‚Äú to anything is simply advising  that if you truly want to experience (this) you have be present for it \n \nThere‚Äôs no in between\n\nI‚Äôm reminded of this quote:\n‚ÄúEach of you is perfect the way you are ... and you can use a little improvement.‚Äù\nShunryu Suzuki\n\nThe sole purpose of meditation is to realize our true Self. Period. Nothing more, nothing less. One can sell it whichever way they want to sell, but that will never be the true essence of meditation. Whatever the marketing and advertising industry has sold, those might be the benefits but they are only the side effects. And they will fall off if one is doing meditation for the right reason with the right intention.\n\nOur ‚Äútrue ‚Äú self is just and illusion buddy\n\n‚ÄúTrying to define yourself is like trying to bite your own teeth ‚Äú - Alan Watts\n\nOur true nature isn‚Äôt something that can be grasped or labeled. \n\nThe essence of who we are is beyond words , concepts or labels , it‚Äôs something we can only experience directly, in the present moment.\n\nSometimes the phrases ‚Äútrue self‚Äù and ‚Äúno self‚Äù actually mean the same thing. Different traditions use those phrases to point at the same truth. What most people think of as their ‚Äúself‚Äù - that isn‚Äôt there when you look for it. But just as you say the essence is beyond words, what means sometimes people use different words trying to point to the same thing. \nNon-duality, Source, God, true self, no-self, The Universe - all examples I‚Äôve heard used.\n\nWell said. There is the little self which is nothing but our ego and then there is the Self or pure consciousness or whatever we want to call it, that is beyond comprehension or words.\n\nHow is that different from true self? I never said to grasp the concept through mind, body or intellect. I completely agree that it is at an experience level we can know the real self but that realization comes through meditation or at least that is what the true purpose of meditation is.\n\nExactly, that‚Äôs the point. The idea of a ‚Äòtrue self‚Äô suggests something static, but we‚Äôre constantly evolving. Meditation, to me, isn‚Äôt about discovering some fixed ‚Äòself‚Äô but about embracing our ever-changing nature.\n\nSo then the GOAL is to embrace your ever-changing  nature\n\nNo that just happen it‚Äôs not a goal it‚Äôs either you accept it or don‚Äôt\n\nAlso, did you even try to understand or question what I meant by true self or you just simply wanted to counter by quoting Sam Harris and say true self is just an illusion \"buddy\"?\n\nNot sure who I quoted as that just came from me , but yes I see your perspective on ‚Äútrue self‚Äù and completely understand,but no I don‚Äôt question it , as I already have my answer of ‚Äú true self ‚Äú there‚Äôs nothing to question.\n\nThanks for posting this. It a good reminder. Because while meditation does have lots of benefits, if you FIXATE on the benefits more than the meditation, you lose the benefits of the meditation itself.\n\nI sometimes find myself fixating on the benefits which makes me feel like meditation is stressful WORK, and when that happens, I don't want to meditate. But when I just let the moment be, I tend to like meditation more. And then I get the benefits anyway.\n\nBut with fixation on results, you risk just getting stress and anxiety. So, while it's natural to definitely WANT the results, these results shouldn't constantly be your focus every time you mediate; otherwise you'll probably never see those results. \n\nSo thanks for this advice. It's much needed and appreciated, at least for me.\n\nVery welcome üôèüèºüóø\n\nI don‚Äôt like this train of thought.¬†\n\nHowever, one guy explained it differently: Meditation can be a transformative practice in the sense that it changes how you experience things.¬†¬†\n\n¬†The issue for ‚Äúgoal setters‚Äù is that you cannot actually know how it is going to be like when your experience of existence changes - until it changes. And then you can‚Äôt go back anymore. ¬†\n\nSo maybe it‚Äôs more about allowing room for a spontaneous transformation, that cannot be defined and set ¬†as a goal beforehand.\n\nIt‚Äôs not a train of thought it‚Äôs an innate perspective due to years of meditation practice\n\nOk. Therefore I don‚Äôt like your innate perspective that you developed through years of meditation practice.\n\nüóøü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\n\nI just realized that sadly we are all trying to learn meditation by ourselves, instead of having a master to follow and learn from like in the old days.\n\nMost people that use this sub seem to meditate on their own with apps and Youtube videos and the like. Very few or almost no one that posts here participates in a sangha with meditation guides.\n\nStruggling for years on a subject that is simpler than learning how to ride a bicycle, means you aren't ready for it. I mastered meditation in a few months, and discovered all of it's deeper zones, with a 20 dollar weekend meditation course. People make up their own complexities and  anti-meditation aspirations ,and expect it to work as expected, with all the benefits arriving as quickly as their fidgety  cellphone.\n\nGood for you üëçüèºüóø\n\nThe moment you stop expecting meditation to fix you, it kinda starts to work. Funny how that happens.\n\nNice suggestion. The alan watt quote is amazing. What book you recommend of Allan watt that I read first ?\n\nThe book and the taboo on knowing yourself\n\nYes and, people have goals and aspirations and the fact is, meditation can help with almost all of these. \nThe key is not to get stuck in craving for these goals.\n\nSounds good. Peace out ‚úåÔ∏èüòÑ\n\nü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüóø\n\nSounds like someone has been skipping meditation. \n\nMuch ado about nothing! üßòüèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\n\nYou‚Äôre assumption is baseless ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\nNot quite I‚Äôm meditating just fine üòâbut I‚Äôd love to hear what you think is ‚Äòmuch ado about nothing ‚Äò. Let‚Äôs keep it constructive.\n\nSo are yours!  Setting an intention is apart of many meditation practices.  \n\nSaying there is only one goal for meditation is silly.  Adding form to the formless.\n\n‚ÄúThe whole point of meditation‚Ä¶‚Äù The whole point of meditation is whatever the practitioner decides ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\n\nYou‚Äôre right‚Äîmeditation is a personal journey, and everyone‚Äôs approach can be different. When I said ‚Äòthe whole point,‚Äô I was speaking from my own experience and what I‚Äôve found to be most effective, dropping expectations and just being present. But I get that for others, setting intentions or goals can be a meaningful part of their practice. At the end of the day, it‚Äôs all about what resonates with you personally. Appreciate the dialogue. ‚úåÔ∏è\n\nWhen did I say this ?\nNever did I say don‚Äôt set intentions\n\nI get what you‚Äôre saying‚Äîthere are definitely meditation practices that use intentions, and they can be powerful. My point was more about not getting overly attached to specific outcomes or turning meditation into a means to an end\n\nYou miss the true point of meditation if you think there is a need to make assertions about how others actively practice it.\n\nI simply gave advice , take it as you will ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüóø\n\n‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©πüôåüèæ Peace and blessings\n\nTo be here and now is Meditation.\n\nI meditate to increase the time spent in meditation, am I doing it right???\n\nHmm üßê just meditate for the sake of it ?\n\nI thought this was a REALLY funny joke, especially for people who do Monroe meditations ‚Äî IYKYK ‚Äî but, yeah, once again I am only funny to myself. (: \n\nI agree obviously the idea of meditation is to do nothing, but be. It is the closest we can consciously come to purely existing. Any tasks added onto meditation become a form of play. Playing with existence. Which is cool! But it‚Äôs different.\n\nI dont get why people have to gatekeep meditation. Sounds pretentious\n\nWhat‚Äôs gatekeeping about this? I‚Äôm genuinely open to discussion. If you think I‚Äôm being pretentious, I‚Äôd love to hear why,let‚Äôs actually talk it through instead of throwing out accusations. I‚Äôm here to share perspectives, not shut anyone down. üóøü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüóø\n\nThis is gatekeepy let me tell you what I see. Your getting off the the aspect of \"oh im doing this for a higher purpose\" and your people are not. also you cant get something specific out of meditation. says who ? ironicly the people who know all the right words and philosophy struggle the most with the actual practice and the people who actually go deep because they have a motivation\n\nThat‚Äôs your perspective not mine\n\nnah man your saing all the right stuff that people here love keep it up\n\nü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è envy is a big green monster friend.  My advice meditate on it\n\nthat wasnt an insult but ok lol\n\nI wasn‚Äôt reciprocating an insult either. I‚Äôm stating what I‚Äôm seeing from my own perspective.\n\nyour not as good as you think buddy. im sorry but someone has to tell you this now sit down\n\nI‚Äôm as good as everyone else ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüóø\n\nAgain my whole hearted advice \n\nmeditate üòâ\n\nIt looks like you're asking about how to start your meditation practice.\n\nHere's a link to our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/wiki/faq#wiki_how_do_i_begin.3F) with everything you need to know to get started!\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Meditation) if you have any questions or concerns.*\n\nWrong bot I‚Äôm\nGiving advice\n\nIf it would be so my freind‚Ä¶ just trying to calm down the mind will not change it.\n\nCan meditation help with being more engaged in the present?\n\nThat‚Äôs the the point of meditation, however if you come into it , with that mindset (if I meditate I will be more present ) it‚Äôs counter productive and you will never attain such presentness as you‚Äôre constantly ‚Äútrying ‚Äú to reach it by using meditation as a means to an end.\n\nOkay, I think I get what you are trying to say. Here's what I would say - our little self - consisting of body, mind and intellect is always changing/evolving. If that is what you are referring to as a true self then I agree - it is never static. However, from a non-dualistic point of view, our true Self goes beyond the body, mind and intellect and it is the unchanging factor within which all these changes occur. Think of it this way - I'm a child, I am an adult, I am a middle aged person and so on. We go through all these different transitions in life and we are constantly changing - every second and beyond that. But w.r.t that changing factor therein lies a changeless factor which allows us to experience all these changes. The ultimate goal from a non-dualistic point of view is to realize that - our true Self.\n\nNot trying to say anything , I‚Äôm firm in what I said.I get where you‚Äôre coming from with the non-dualistic perspective, and I respect that view. But for me, I‚Äôm more grounded in what‚Äôs directly experienced here and now in this physical world. I base my understanding on the reality we can observe, rather than relying on metaphysical concepts that are more theoretical. I‚Äôm not dismissing those ideas; they‚Äôre just not how I choose to frame my experience or understanding.\n\nIn a sense you're right. Meditating to be happy or to cure insomnia will have limited results.\n\nOn the other hand, if someone just endeavors to sit and \"be with themselves\", that's merely reverie. Meditation is hard work and easy to do wrong. It's mind training. It's not something to be mastered through Reddit posts. If you just sit and relax, maybe take a few slow breaths, that's a good way to calm down, but it's not meditation. You'll just be wasting whatever effort you've made.\n\nAlan Watts said lots of clever things that sound good, but he wasn't realized. Quotes like the one above just leave people feeling incompetent. There's no method. It's just a naive demand that one approach life as play. That then leads to New Age misconceptions, with people being aggressively happy and peaceful, smiling all the time as they desperately try to be enlightened, but with a mirthless smile that looks like they need to find a bathroom quick.\n\nThat‚Äôs not necessarily true if you look at the Buddhist traditions. Meditation helps expand the awareness of your consciousness and helps you root out certain impulses and judgements that usually move you without consideration. Just a simple example but there are more. Meditation does have attainable goals. And there are many facets of meditation and consciousness that are explored once you get more into it and get more and more experienced.\n\nWhile I understand your intent with this post, it is a somewhat incorrect assumption. \n\"Meditation\" is not a singular thing, it is not a monolith. There are nearly 50 distinct styles or types of meditation that we know of today, so it is more accurate to describe \"meditation\" as an umbrella term. \nMany of these styles of meditation do in fact contain goals by their nature, such as compassion meditation or even the seemingly ubiquitous mindfulness meditation. 'Just being' as you mentioned, is its own thing, which could actually fall under a few different styles depending on *how* you choose to 'just be' (i.e. internally or externally). \n\nI can appreciate your intent here, however. We can often get wrapped up in trying to achieve something (like \"enlightenment\") via meditation, and that can certainly have some negative effects in regards to creating illusion, spiritual bypassing, and egoic blockages.\n\nMore or less my intent with this comment is to create a bit of clarity on the often obfuscated or mysticised nature of generally how westerners think of a meditation practice. Asserting that it is singular or that there is no goal to all types of practice just leads to confusion.\n\nThat‚Äôs just it , never did I said meditation is to do obtain or seek ‚Äúnirvana , enlightenment‚Äù, as that‚Äôs already here ,(present) meditation is simply a practice to me nothing else nothing more , people ‚Äútry ‚Äú to add meaning to it but , meditation is simply just that , meditation nothing else. The ‚Äúsub‚Äù categories of meditation is what holds you back from being present in the first place.\n\n\"Enlightenment\" was put in quotations because it is not imo an actual achievable goal. It is a life long practice that contains multitudes, all of which exist here and now. It was also simply meant as an example, and was not reflective of anything you said.\n\nI can appreciate your intention of stripping away what you feel is uneeded or irrelevant for yourself. Asserting that your way is the true way for everyone, however, is egoic. \n\nWhile the ego is not our enemy, it can and does hide behind assertions like this. Consider that life is a learning process and that no person has all of the information, lest we would no longer be corporeal.\n\nThe 'sub' types of meditation are often extremely distinct, such as ecstatic dance in contrast to one pointed focus. If you simply did nothing in either of these styles, you would not get the experience that they are meant to contain. On a neurological level, different types of meditation access different brainwave states. They are distinct in this way, as well. While doing the practice of just being that you are mentioning, you would be accessing alpha waves. With compassion meditation, it would be gamma. With one pointed focus, it would be beta. Fundementally, they are not ubiquitous, and so trying different styles can lead to very different experiences- both as the practice itself and from a neurological standpoint. \nI wish you the best of luck in your practice, and happy meditating.\n\nThere are benefits to meditation but the post states the best approaches is to just be with yourself. And be curious.  The journey is the goal.\n\nWhich reminds of the idea of saying prayers only to gain some advantage. I grew up in a deeply religious society and the whole culture around praying was to obtain some worldly gains through God's deliberations in their favor, or even secure a plot of land in the afterlife! (can you imagine...). In other words, there's an almost universal inclination to resort to higher powers, forces, beings or so-called esoteric traditions for some advantage.\n\nNgl this sounds like it came from someone who is attached to the identity of their perception of ‚Äúsomeone who meditates‚Äù vs someone who actually meditates\n\nYa I actually meditate, consistently for 8 years now actually , I‚Äôm sharing my experience and perspective\n\nWhy would someone meditate just to meditate? You always do everything to better the quality of your life somehow. Even the Buddha meditated to gain something - the true perspective of life and the nature of reality.\n\nI understand what you are suggesting is being in the present moment just for being Zen. But lots of people have built up stress and trauma that wont allow them to simply enjoy the moment or stop their thoughts. With meditation it helps to heal and release away built up stress and karma and better enjoy the moment.\n\nActually, the Buddha didn‚Äôt meditate to gain something. He realized that enlightenment and nirvana were always here‚Äînothing to grasp, just to be.\n\nMeditation is about being present with the practice itself. When you approach it with wants and needs, those very expectations can block what you‚Äôre seeking. Let things unfold naturally as you meditate, without trying to force an outcome.\n\nMeditation isn‚Äôt magic, and it‚Äôs not a quick fix. It‚Äôs not a means to an end‚Äîit is the end itself.\n\nI used to think it's that simple too till some years ago. But it's not that simple. I can just sit here, be Zen and say 'I have achieved what the Buddha had achieved' and Buddhists will laugh at me of course. Because this is not the full complete meditation. This is just being Zen. Over time I discovered more and met meditators and specially met a friend of mine who researched very deep into the origin of meditation. It's not just sitting in Zen. It has 4 or 5 major parts, of which being Zen is just the preparation. What the Buddha did required immense practice and stillness because he was constantly being harrassed by his own inner demons as well as the external world's Maya. This is why even other enlightened beings recognized him and regarded him as the greatest one ever. Enlightened ones even visited him when he was born because they knew he was going to do something big.\n\nFriend \nMeditation is that simple ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è \nBut again that‚Äôs my perspective \nNothing to overthink or overanalyze\n\nWe are talking about 2 different things. You mean to just use the Zen part of it to chill with it and that's cool too. I've been there in the past. But at my current stage I'm interested in the full process which goes much deeper. No pressure or nothing to you. But my perspective is now wider after more research into it's actual origins.\n\nI‚Äôm talking about the same thing \nü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è you do you , meditation to me is simple and to the point , everything else is overthinking its process \n\nSimplicity and consistency is key , to live in the here and now , moment to moment to moment etc‚Ä¶. And so on and so on\n\nYes but that is the description of what it is for, not what you suddenly do. It has a process to achieve something like a supersight. If done for a long time, it can create a very high intelligence in you. This is achieved by a 4 step progressive method in which people actually change over a period of time's practice.\n\nYeah you live in resting awareness like I do , a primal way of being without compromise of thought or overthinking\n\nyea.. totes... BUTüòÇüôèmy friend sorry to keep going on this. After a while of resting in that place, you discover that stuff begins to unlock for you and there's more deeper levels to discover. They don't require overthinking, just understanding. And it's exciting to discover them and what they mean.\n\nI don‚Äôt care for ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è these deeper levels of understanding at the ‚Äúmoment ‚Äú I‚Äôm indifferent , I‚Äôm enjoying this , the present moment and I will continue on doing  so for the rest of my my days. Everything else is in your head , and I‚Äôm out of it.\n\nI'm so glad that I came to meditation the way I did. My practices allow me to curate my inner experience. This is the meaning of true salvation.\n\nI'm glad someone shared my pov üíØ\n\nGlad it resonates with you friend\n\ntruth!"

    "all_comment_text": "Practice saying kinds things to yourself.\n\nSomewhere along the way, your inner voice picked up, being negative, likely in a misguided way of protecting you.\n\nYou need to change the habit. \n\nYou need to habituate speaking kindly to yourself.\n\nThis. It‚Äôs just practice. \n\nWe are mostly just robots that execute our conditioning, so if we have conditioned patterns that we want to change, we just recondition with new patterns.\n\nEdit/Addition: Look into IFS (Internal Family Systems) or ‚Äúreparenting the inner child‚Äù work - for some structure and insight on how to change your tone with yourself. \nIt‚Äôs basically about acknowledging you are made up of many parts and cultivating a relationship with yourself where part of you is this loving parent that comforts and supports the parts of you that are fragmented and having a hard time, and integrates them into your whole.\n\nWhat might help is maybe to think about the things you would say to a close and admired friend if they told you they were having the negative thoughts you've had.\nHere are some loose examples:\n\nImpulse thought: \"I am stupid for making this mistake, and I'll never get better.\"\n\nRestructured thought: \"No, I'm not stupid. Maybe I feel stupid, but I am only human, so I'm allowed to make mistakes like everyone else. Recognizing mistakes means I am growing, and they're an inevitable part of any process.\"\n\n\nImpulse thought: \"Oh my god I look awful! My skin is gross and I am so chubby. How could anyone ever like me?\"\n\nRestructured thought: \"Feeling bad about my appearance today doesn't change the ever-present qualities that I will always have. People tell me I have a lovely smile or an intriguing sense of style. Besides, it's a fact that preference is 100 percent subjective, and even if I'm not my type, I am inevitably somebody else's. Most importantly, appearance will never determine a person's worth or capacity for joy in life .... Anyone who doesn't recognize that isn't worth putting the time or effort into in the long run, anyway.\"\n\n\nImpulse thought: \"I keep neglecting my goals in life like a lazy slob... what is wrong with me? I should just give up.\"\n\nRestructured thought: \"I deserve patience and self-compassion. While I recognize that my goals are important to me, it's good to remember that success is never linear. Everyone's motivations, needs, and paths are different, including mine. It's okay to go at my own pace. As long as I keep making steps, no matter how slow or how small, I will keep making progress, and that's better than nothing at all. I will figure things out eventually, and if not, that's okay too.\"\n\nReframing your thoughts! Yay!\n\nEchoes from long ago, is my guess. Ask yourself this: if someone else were talking to me this way, would I put up with it? Then why do I put up with this?\n\n&gt; Sit down, close your eyes, and invite the critical part of you to chat. Say you‚Äôre here to listen in non-judgement. And give this critical part of you room to speak freely. You‚Äôll discover a lot. Maybe ask this part of you a few questions that allow you to discover more. Mention that from now on you‚Äôll address its concerns more fully without the negative self criticism. At the end, thank this part of you for showing up and trying to help you.\n&gt; \n&gt; This is internal family systems (IFS) therapy and it has worked wonders for the various parts of me that take over when I‚Äôm not meeting my needs\n\nI've found that a lot of my problems come from this - an old self-protective measue gone-wrong. For whatever reason, it never occurred to me that my self criticism might be explained the same way. Any thoughts on the possible origins of this? I can't work out where it might have come from. Does anyone have any suggestions on how this negative voice originates in self protection?\n\nMetta meditation is what you are looking for. Metta means loving kindness. It is about cultivating loving kindness and goodwill for yourself and others.\n\nIt's amazing how much it can help. It's wonderful that you see the need to improve your self talk, it will be very beneficial to your well being.\n\nYou can do Metta meditation on your own,  it's rather simple. You should be able to find plenty of guides to practice online. [Here is a guided  example.](https://youtu.be/IFYYxIv5uhc?si=VMS3mPeg7ey6dbCz)\n\nI concur. Metta definitely helped me a lot in this regard.\n\nI feel strong resistance towards metta. I just can‚Äôt provide good thoughts towards myself, when I try I not only *not* believe anything I say but I also feel very revolted and angry. Like I must prevent myself from doing such thing. What should I do?\n\nI did a guided meditation that helped with this. I'll see if i can find it but the idea was to think back to yourself as a young child (Either from your own memories or an image of yourself that you may have picked up from old photos). Wish that child happiness, safety, freedom from suffering. Realise that you really do want this for that child. Sit with this for a while. Then imagine yourself as a teenager and do the same. Then as a young man/woman. Realise you really want these good things for that younger self. Think about all the twists and turns that lay ahead of them, the sufferings and joys that you know lay in store. Then try to realise that this person is you. Now picture yourself as you are today and try to send those same wishes to your current self: \"May you be happy, may you feel safe, may you be free from suffering\".\n\nHelped me a little bit. If you can get just a little bit that is good. Meta is a skill that can be practiced. If loving kindness towards yourself is too difficult, work on loving kindness towards others (pick the easiest person you can when starting out). Keep coming back to the attempt to aim it at yourself as you improve.\n\nBest of luck!\n\nThank you very much\n\nSit down, close your eyes, and invite the critical part of you to chat. Say you‚Äôre here to listen in non-judgement. And give this critical part of you room to speak freely. You‚Äôll discover a lot. Maybe ask this part of you a few questions that allow you to discover more. Mention that from now on you‚Äôll address its concerns more fully without the negative self criticism. At the end, thank this part of you for showing up and trying to help you.\n\nThis is internal family systems (IFS) therapy and it has worked wonders for the various parts of me that take over when I‚Äôm not meeting my needs.\n\nThis is it. Carl Jung was saying this almost 100 years ago and its so simple but absolutely true. OP said \"how do i condition\" which is almost saying \"how do i control or manipulate this part?\" Which is really unkind to a part that just wants to help in the way it thinks is best.\n\nI use the analogy of a little kid offering to help you clean dishes after a big thanksgiving dinner. His intention is good but he doesnt know how to help in the best way. So he just makes a mess and makes more work at the end of the day. \n\nSo its understanding the real message \"i want to help\" with that compromise you had mentioned. \"Okay it cant wash the dishes good but i can hand it the clean cups to put away.\"\n\nIt changes the whole game in so many words. All the other stuff is helpful for sure. But this is the cornerstone for me.\n\nThis felt beautiful. We often are kind with others but ourselves.\n\nYou just saved me this evening with this, thank you sincerely for sharing this practice with me.\n\nMany of these replies are simplistic and reductive, almost mechanistic in thinking. \n\nIt isn't \"just practice\" or \"just a habit.\" It is almost certainly trauma if it is persistent and damaging. \n\nTrauma work is the way to go here. Mindfulness as an ambiguous set of practices hasn't really caught up to the science of trauma in the body and mind. At the very least, mindfulness should be paired with trauma work.\n\nI‚Äôll second this. Trauma work, internal family systems, self compassion practices like Kristin Neff‚Äôs work, have all helped me heal trauma and get the most out of meditation.\n\nThank you for the intro to Kristin Neff, loving her videos and website\n\nAny meditation practice, as long as it becomes a habit, will start you on the road to realise that the time meditating is creating a safe-haven that you are in charge of. So if the world comes down on you, at any time you want you can escape into a world of peace. This starts the notion that you are the solution to creating kindness within yourself. Then you are on your way.\n\nTenaciously repeat affirmations.\n\nMemorize them until they roll off your tongue whether they feel real or not.\n\nEventually they do.\n\nQuitting early or gaslighting yourself with mundane or usual reasoning like, ‚Äúrobotic self talk doesn‚Äôt work because Google said, x, y and z things, blah blah blah.‚Äù Is the reason why most fail.\n\nThought repetition becomes neuron. That neuron upgrades itself with similar data into a gang of neurons. That optimizes itself over time even more. That is the hormone output that becomes automatic and memorized. That upgrades even more over time. I think you get the picture here.\n\nThen Wala, you have new uplifting, automatic, positive words for yourself with minimal fuss and engineering. That run and run. They continuously detangle the web of lies of the past self over time. More and more.\n\nQuitters of the process are simply repeating something that got to them more, repeating quitting.\n\nYou got this! God speed.\n\nYes, this! The first thing I was told to do in therapy was find an affirmation video on YouTube and listen to it CONSTANTLY or 2 weeks. While you shower, brush your teeth, on your drive to/from work, while you're cooking and doing chores. I listened to (and repeated) affirmations an absurd amount for 2 weeks. By the end of that timeline I loved doing affirmations and any time a (self) abusive thought would pop up it was like my body would recoil away from it. Those thoughts began to feel foreign and silly even. I was able to give myself so much grace.\n\nEssentially giving yourself grace is repeating affirmations until they feel real.\n\nI also forgot to point out. Neurons that no longer fire together no longer wire together. The old networks that are overshadowed with the newer upgraded ones will literally be pruned apart. A literal new you is born.\n\nI keep hearing a lot about affirmations, just wondering can they be to simple?\n\nI get a lot of resonance from 'I am safe' but seems so generic... if that makes any sense\n\nYes it works. Every word has an end product hormone. Safe has a feeling, which are hormones attached to it in higher quality. So saying, ‚ÄúI am safe.‚Äù Repeated a lot works because it‚Äôs then memorized by the body eventually kicks off that combo automatically.\n\nMaybe look at it this way. A kid says they have a scary dream to a parent. The parent says, ‚Äúit‚Äôs ok, it‚Äôs just a dream, it‚Äôs fake.‚Äù The kid feels better. Very simplistic statements work.\n\nThe reason you repeat it a lot is then it will become a large network in the brain and body. That will then automatically start firing off. That will then automatically have a cascading effect throughout the rest of your body. So, for example, if you‚Äôve been scared a lot throughout life for unknown reasons then your adrenal glands may be overworked and just turned on even when not needed as 1 example of many potentials.\n\nRepetition creates a new system will then start re-tuning the parts that are out of tune. Re-tuning simply means the body is creating new networks and disassembling old networks. In a system called pruning. It‚Äôs a beautiful system. Our body is amazing. It just goes with the flow with whatever you‚Äôre thinking about most. The new systems get to work and old systems just disappear and exist more functionally and naturally. Fear is a good thing in the normal reactions like staying away from edges of cliffs.\n\nNow, as I explain it more and more. With more and more details. You begin to read the words and become entrained to them, and you will start to form a belief and then you‚Äôll start to try it. These are the beginning stages, Reddit is the vehicle, which is highly hypnotic and efficient in subconscious programming. In a way if you thoughtfully dissect peoples responses, they will become part of you, literally because all social media and forms of media are programming you. Wisely read comments, wisely choose audios, wisely choose videos they‚Äôre all programming you.\n\nThese are some of the missing keys that everybody is running around searching for with questions like, ‚ÄúOh my gosh, why do I feel this way, seems so simplistic, blah blah blah, can it work?‚Äù These fear based auto thinking will kick off fear based hormones. Which then makes your brain incoherent and learning is shut down in the state of stress. Creating a loop of endless searching.\n\nHowever, now you know and just look up more ways to program yourself and you‚Äôre good to hook. 7-30 days of workout on new mind patterns sets the initial ball rolling and naturally your life will mold into more advanced and customized self talk and thinking by inertia.\n\nI disagree. What you're speaking about is not meeting your own needs, but, to use your own words, gaslighting yourself into happiness. What manner of truth is this? Do you want to live a nice, pleasant lie or do you want the truth?\n\nThe truth is that if OP has negative thought patterns, those have a cause. That cause will maybe recede in the background if you pound it with affirmations, but will not disappear. Unity is just that. Unity. Wholeness. All our \"parts\", all the selves that we generate in response to our circumstances.\n\nIf a kid comes to you crying, would you ignore the suffering and walk away to a kid that doesn't cry because it makes you feel good? How would you view yourself if you did that?\n\nThis gaslighting and escapism from suffering and pain is misguided and dangerous. There is a reason we feel suffering. That's a pointer that we need to address something.\n\nIt works.\n\nLooking for root causes or acknowledging them I never contended with. OP asked for a technique that works. This works.\n\nThere are root causes that have no known origin like lost in memory childhood traumas or subtle subconscious programming over time that will never be identified. Leaving person looking in an endless loop. This solves that.\n\nThe science is out there go look for yourself.\n\nUsing an affirmation as a mantra will give you more positive background chatter in your head but it won't change the attitude that's causes someone to be negative towards themselves. You're not practicing self-love, you're practicing saying a phrase until that repetition is an automated habit. Metta aka loving kindness is what teaches you to tap into your capacity for love and goodwill, to feel them towards yourself, and then to turn that feeling outward as well.\n\nIt literally works and it is a message that is loving to yourself. Hence, you form a memory, neuron, that turns into a gang of neurons, that has a hormone output that will then develop the personality. The old neurons will prune apart because neurons that no longer fire together no longer wire together. A new you, that is developed with a new phrase of loving words, that have a new hormone output. That then attracts or self navigates to new people, places, things, events, ideas and so on.\n\nAddition: meditation, EMDR, EFT, NLP, hypnosis, chants, mantras and other self or guided messaging is a form of **intentional** self subconscious communication, aka, programming **your intention** in a purposeful way with what **you** want to program or intend. Stored in neurons.\n\nMusic, TV, social media, magazine covers at checkouts, comments, music (chants &amp; mantras), subliminal messaging in staged symbolism is a form of **unintentional** self subconscious communication, aka, programming **someone else‚Äôs** in a purposeful way with what you **they** to program or intend. Stored in neurons.\n\nAll programs have a hormone output, stored in neurons. String your program together what you want to feel, self love in this case, in a media of choice (chants, mantras, self talk, stories) and deliver it in a method of choice (meditation, hypnosis, chants, mantras). Tenaciously repeat. Religiously repeat. On and on.\n\nWhether we realize it or not, something is being repeated and installed all the time.\n\nI didn't mean to knock on your personal experience, sorry if I came off that way. I obviously don't know anything about you or your practice, there's nothing that says you can't feel love and goodwill for yourself in meditation without intentionally practicing metta and intentionally or not, the process will do its thing. And what I wrote below isn't a knock on your personal experience either, these are general claims that definitely don't describe the outcome of every individual case. That said...   \n  \nWhen a person does something they do form a neural network for doing that thing and every time they use it, it does become stronger, no argument here. Where I disagree is the assumption that saying something is necessarily the same feeling it, for everyone and at all times. If the person only repeats affirmations without actually *feeling* love and goodwill towards themself, they'll form a neural network that produces and hears those words on repeat but it won't be connected to the networks where feelings of love and goodwill reside and they still won't have actually cultivated self-love. Only evoking the feelings can connect them to the affirmation network, which is why it's important that the practice evokes the emotions and why I think Metta is the better recommendation.   \nI also want to add a caveat about disused neural nets, they don't necessarily just get pruned and that's it either. For newer and weaker networks the rule is use it or lose it indeed but strong and well-established networks don't just get pruned out, we don't yet know the rules that govern the pruning of these networks. Like how you never forget how to ride a bike.   \n  \n&gt;String your program together what you want to feel, self love in this case, in a media of choice (chants, mantras, self talk, stories) and deliver it in a method of choice (meditation, hypnosis, chants, mantras). Tenaciously repeat. Religiously repeat. On and on.  \n  \nHere I totally disagree with your take on meditation though. You're not a linear, transistor-transistor-logic based, binary calculator nor is meditation a linear, arithmetic process. I understand the technological metaphor but it's just a metaphor, meditation isn't just a portable media to deliver code to a system. Chants and mantras can be part of meditations but they're not necessary for meditation and are not meditations in and of themselves. It is the meditation which allows us to train the mind like a workout allows us to train our muscles, and practice is practice regardless of the intensity that suits you best - not everyone at the gym wants to be a power-lifter and not everyone who meditates wants liberation or as it's commonly mistranslated, enlightenment.      \n\nAs for covert advertising, yeah it's a thing and it's good at tricking the ego but that and meditation aren't the same at all. Meditation is a training regiment that doesn't rely on incidental exposure or tricking the ego into desiring something and it can do so much more than any form of advertising can. To use a technological metaphor myself, covert advertising can give you in-system pop-ups at most, meditation can give you superuser permissions.\n\nIt‚Äôs not a take. There‚Äôs data.\n\nI‚Äôm not here to debate or carry this on much further.\n\nI‚Äôm only going this far because you‚Äôre now the hypnotist using tenacity and repetition the exact thing that programs anyone reading comment stance can take on limiting views or splitting hairs on what self love is or meditation.\n\n1 last way of explaining, then I‚Äôm done with this thread.\n\nYou‚Äôre either the Placebo or Nocebo.\n\nThat which builds or that which disrupts.\n\nA practice, any practice, repeated, will ignite the innate self healing which is self love, which the body knows how to do f it‚Äôs believed consciously and subconsciously and that is all.\n\nRepeated practice does it and that‚Äôs it, even Reddit comments as the vehicle is a repeated practice that is either the Placebo or Nocebo in nature.\n\nIf OP has read this far considering those that sharp shoot, rote memory and rote repetition.\n\nKnow this. It works if you believe it. That‚Äôs it.\n\nA belief is a thought repeated enough until it‚Äôs hardwired and has a hormone output that then attracts the people, places, things and events that guide you to it.\n\nExample: Literally today a friend of mine who I haven‚Äôt seen in 10 months. Reported to me she did a list form manifestation for 10 year old plantar warts that would not go away. Traditional medicine failed.\n\nShe wrote ONLY written words daily in a journal style. ROTE, WROTE repetition phrases like, ‚Äúmy immune system is strong.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe warts are disappearing.‚Äù And so on. 7 days in she started seeing results. They‚Äôre completely gone by 90 days after 10 years of lingering.\n\nI repeat: SHE USED WRITTEN WORD ONLY. No meditation, no chants, no hypnosis, no EMDR, EFF, NLP so on.\n\nMeditation, NLP, EFT, hypnosis, EMDR, and so on are all the same in the sense THEY ARE SUBCONSCIOUS reprogramming systems. Even written words.\n\nUse tenacity and repetition of any method. You‚Äôll have guaranteed subconscious reprogramming results.\n\nGood day.\n\nJust like you would talk to a small child: whenever you notice a critical or negative inner voice- ‚ÄúI hear you and I understand your perspective, but that‚Äôs not acceptable, we have to do ______ instead ‚Äú. After a while this kind of response will be automatic. The key is to be gentle and welcoming. Hear the voice and accept its input, but respond with kinder words to yourself\n\nNegative self talk and negative energy was all I knew until I found myself in an abusive relationship. I wanted out of the relationship and had no self worth. So I found some! \n\nIf you can‚Äôt figure out how to change your thought patterns. First notice them. Do not judge them. Just allow them to be. And as you notice them they actually disappear because your authentic self comes through and love overpowers the ego that is the negative self talk. \n\nYou hold beliefs about yourself that you don‚Äôt actually agree with, causing the negative self talk. You asking this question is all the willingness you need to unblock the love that is available to you. \n\nStart by looking in the mirror at yourself. Really looking. When I‚Äôm starting to spiral or have a trigger moment and I‚Äôm alone, I state my feelings out loud and look in the mirror. I know it sounds silly but it‚Äôs never failed me  \n\nI look in the mirror and for example I will say I‚Äôm so frustrated, I‚Äôm just angry and eventually my ego gives itself away through ideas that it‚Äôs not fair, why me or if only. As I look at myself I eventually‚Ä¶. It takes like two seconds to be honest and I am like wait I can change my mind though. So what‚Äôs the other option? \n\nI then will just kinda talk myself through it or listen to an affirmation audio. I love the insight timer app,  superhuman is kinda too much money for an app but I just love it. Changing your mind and how you talk to yourself will change everything and then some. ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nThere are a million books out there!! Read the four agreements ü•∞ it‚Äôs changed my life and I also did the 40 day meditation practice from Gabrielle Bernstein s book May Cause Miracles which I ordered used on amazing for five bucks.  \n\nHehehe ü§≠ I‚Äôm a little passionate about this. Good luck love üíï the moment you feel pure joy from experiencing the you that you are. You‚Äôll want to come back over and over again. It‚Äôs all about the bounce back babe!\n\nI hope this is possible and that I can do it..\n\nThe universe is a yes for whatever you believe üòâ take a chance on yourself. It‚Äôs not a destination it‚Äôs a way of experiencing and living. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll find out ü•∞\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ar8PbATergE\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVqANXVTLN4\n\nhttp://happinessbeyondthought.blogspot.com/2012/05/surrendering-i-letting-go-of-suffering.html\n\nEveryone should do parts work!!!!\n\nLoving Kindness Meditation (metta) is exactly about this.  https://www.mindful.org/this-loving-kindness-meditation-is-a-radical-act-of-love/\n\nThere is a meditation from Buddhism called loving kindness, might be worth checking out.  His words were,\n\n \"‚Äò*If the freedom of the mind brought about by love is cultivated and enhanced, always practiced, made one‚Äôs vehicle and foundation, strengthened, consolidated and properly undertaken, one will be blessed in these eleven ways. One sleeps happily, wakes happily, has no bad dreams, is dear to humans, dear to non-humans, cherished by the gods, protected from fire, poison and weapons, easily concentrated, has a radiant complexion, passes away peacefully and after death at the very least is reborn in heaven*‚Äô (A.V,342)\"\n\n  \n[https://www.dhammawiki.com/index.php/Metta\\_meditation](https://www.dhammawiki.com/index.php/Metta_meditation)\n\nTrain your awareness, so when the negative thought happens you recognize when it happens and what it is, then ask yourself where did that thought come from, notice that it comes and goes, the same as everything else.\n\nAlso notice when thoughts come that it might be more fleeting than others, the moments when you have positive thought that fade and are forgotten, why do you cling to the thoughts you cling to.\n\nSomewhere down that path, you will learn more about where your senses, thoughts, emotions, come from and memory's place in reinforcing thought patterns.\n\nJust take  20-40 minutes and just take time to slow down, forget time, just breath follow the breath, when your awareness moves to anything other than breath just recognize it, watch it come and go and return to breath, try to recognize how judgement is applied and try to separate yourself from it.\n\nGood Luck.\n\nTherapy with the right therapist is a solid start IF you are also dealing with mental health issues like Anxiety, Depression, PTSD, etc.\n\nThis may be a different take on this topic, but one thing I've been doing (learnt through the book, the untethered sou) is to identify that we are not our thoughts. We are the entity observing our thoughts. \n\nWhen we start to build this separation between who * you * are vs what your thoughts are, we can start to see that * you * can have conversations with these thoughts. Ask it questions like \"well why do you think this is true\" because * you * don't have to agree  with what your minds experiencing. Teaching yourself to be kinder in your mind is caring for your thoughts as if they are the 3 year old child living with you and your teaching this child how to be soft and caring.\n\nImagine your inner voice is speaking to a fried of yours. Would you speak to them the same way you do yourself? Try to keep this point of view when you begin negative self talk. Try to replace the thought with something kind. After awhile it‚Äôll come more naturally. \n\nMy brain tends to circulate whatever thoughts I let it, so I heard about this approach once, and it helped. \n\nGood luck on your journey OP.\n\n-MIR Method - it takes less than 2 min a day for 20 days. It‚Äôs resets your avatar. \n-Practice, reword things so they are kinder.  Just try to be a loving parent to yourself. \n-Use subliminal videos on YouTube that have positive affirmations to build your your self-concept \n-EFT - This will help you get to neutral \n-Don‚Äôt be afraid to honor how you feel. Negative feelings can be like hold a beach ball under water. It takes a lot of energy to suppress them and they aren‚Äôt going to go away like that. Feel it to heel it. Let the emotions wash over you or pass through. \n-Journal your feelings. Don‚Äôt censor yourself. Let it all out. \n-IFS/Parts Work - you were given these beliefs and they are not yours. Try to get to the story you are telling yourself. Find the origin so you can unburden the part of you that carries that belief. \n-Louise Hay‚Äôs book ‚ÄúYou Can Heal Your Life‚Äù was really helpful to me. \n-Find a creative outlet. This goes hand in hand with the journaling. Find something where you can transmute the negatives thoughts, feelings, and emotions into creative expression. It doesn‚Äôt matter the end result. It‚Äôs all about the transmutation through the experience. \n-Give yourself reminders throughout the day. Maybe it‚Äôs sticky notes in your house and car. Maybe it‚Äôs alerts on your phone. But create visual reminders of positive affirmations. \n-Microdosing is a great way to rewire your neural pathways. You can also take advantage of the brain waves as you go to sleep and wake up. I set this as my alarm for several months. \n[https://youtu.be/kiZ6JDTlmTM?si=jm-wbqImSbg8drLg](https://youtu.be/kiZ6JDTlmTM?si=jm-wbqImSbg8drLg)\n\nFor me it was a combo of Metta and Acceptance \n\nMetta helps you see the world with a loving mind, and acceptance helps you not reject, judge, or repress the feelings you have. The second was the worst part for me.\n\nName her. Name the part of you that speaks negatively. Treat her like an abandoned child. Put her in her place when she loses her shit and give her love.\n\nBest advice I ever heard for this is as follows. \n\nPicture yourself as though you are your own child, rather that you were a person who is in your care, that you like, and want to see succeed. How would you treat that person? How would you want to be treated as that person? What would be the best way to treat that person to keep them happy and healthy?  \n\nBeing persistent with this framing has helped me reshape my internal voice. It's not perfect but it's much more healthy now than it was.\n\nPractice. Whenever you catch yourself being mean turn it around into something compassionate. It‚Äôll take time but as long as you make a conscious effort you‚Äôll get there \n\nFor example, turn ‚ÄúI never do anything right‚Äù into ‚ÄúI made a mistake and that‚Äôs normal but next time I‚Äôll get it right‚Äù\n\nIt's not really a matter of saying kind things to yourself that you won't even believe, that doesn't mean your not being too hard on yourself, but it also means that your wasting too much of your mental bandwidth thinking, instead of actually being present, it's not a matter of converting negativity to positivity. It's a matter of self honesty, do have less thoughts and try to clear your mind, most thoughts about yourself (positive or negative) tend to be a distraction, you will notice that when having less thoughts you will find yourself more at peace and that mental state will make it natural to be kind to yourself and others too. Thoughts were mostly made to communicate and to be pragmatic or useful for practical observation and understanding concepts, those bad thoughts are a manifestation of unfelt emotions, what you can do is write about what you feel, why you feel it and how you can solve it, if there is a solution, solve it, if there isn't accept it. Though remember most emotions come from desire, now it's normal to have desire, just learn how to manage your desires, especially ego based desires that aren't basic human needs.\n\nAlways be impeccable with WORDS. The words you use with others AND especially the words you use talking to yourself. \n\nWORDS are important And dangerous too. Words are used to describe reality BUT too often words are used to CREATE the reality they describe. Be mindful of the power and ACCURACY (honesty, nonjudgmental observation) of the dialogue in your mind. \nNamaste. Carpe Diem!!!\n\nYou will get lot of advices the moment you say negative thoughts. First lets understand the root cause; Negative and positive thoughts are like a south and north pole in a magnet. They always co-exit. If you have a positive thought, like when you say i am going to be healthy, the idea is you might fall sick.  You see there is always negativity behind every positivity.   \n No one on this earth  can only think positive as said because there is negative thought forcing the positiveness.  If you do not think of falling sick you will never think of being healthy.  Do you agree.   \nNow lets understand what is causing negative thought. Its a mental projection of the future based on the past experience. All my past experiences created a residue on my state of consciousness, this is what is projecting all the negativeness and the positiveness. When we get rid of this residue or impressions we are neither positive that means we are not negative either. \n\nHeartfulness gives this wonderful practice of cleaning all these impressions from the past so that i can start my day clean slate.  I am providing the link for Heartfulness practice. You can also reach out to the nearest trainer by using this link https://heartspots.heartfulness.org/  \n\n\nMaster Classes -1 - Relaxation  \nhttps://youtu.be/ric0XnCqcwc  \nMasterclasses Day 2 - Clean &amp; Simplify  \nhttps://youtu.be/XrBojZA8YbA  \nMasterclasses Day 3 - Connect With you inner self  \nhttps://youtu.be/zX5l-LIn7KY\n\nMetta definitely. You can also look into Dr. Kristen Neff‚Äôs mindfulness for self compassion. She is a leading voice on this topic. Her website has a lot of resources.\n\nWhen your inner voice says something particularly fucked up, nonchalantly disagree with it and point it in a positive direction\n\nMeditation, at its core, is about paying attention.  To everything, at all times. Pay attention to the negative thoughts and how they make you feel. With enough attention, over time, the thoughts will subside because you will have full awareness of the harm they cause. This takes time, but is the simplest way to change anything in your life. Mindful attention to everything at all times.\n\nPerhaps you have an internalized \"image\" of a critical caregiver. Or someone who didn't care, or was malicious, such that you felt there must be something wrong with you.\n\nYou can either change the metaphorical image by having better relationships in real life, going to a relational therapist with that approach, or doing Jungian imaginal work yourself where you discover the image of the \"good mother\".\n\nYou can go the route of replacing the personal image with... the universe. Perhaps with Compassion, as an entity, an intelligence.\n\nAnd that is a step toward letting go of image entirely.\n\nI don't know but for me the goal is to get rid of the inner voice as a whole.\n\nYou are not your inner voice.\n\nTo change thoughts I‚Äôve meditated for 5-10 minutes and then affirm my new thoughts. I‚Äôve used sleeping tapes as well.\n\nMantra can help. If you like it, try it. Om\n\nPositive Affirmations in the morning\n\nI would meditate and do the normal attention to breathing and clear the mind exercises. As thoughts intruded I would back trace my train of thought back to the thought or event that led me to the unwanted thought. After doing this for long enough, I could identify the triggers and patterns of thought in real time and change my thinking before the unwanted thoughts invaded.\n\nI need this too\n\nI don't think it's the place of meditation to condition your inner voice to be kinder to yourself. Meditation is about awareness, and in the case of negative self talk, it is sufficient to notice it and let it go.\n\nMaybe try not yelling at it to do better.\n\nNotice when you are being unkind. Don't let it just slip by. Pay attention. Then be gracious with yourself.\n\nSomething that helped me is reframing my perspective. I would never say the mean things I say about myself to my best friend, so why would I say them to myself?\n \nSo I became my own best friend.\n\nI often just ask myself inner voice: why do you say that? I did a Tricycle meditation on equanimity where I visualized three people: someone I care deeply for, someone who I feel frustrated by or disliked, and someone who was an acquaintance.\n\nI came out of it with a way to deeply examine a topic, person, or thought with concentrated attention. It typically comes from asking why.\n\nCelebrate the small wins. Did you wake up without hitting snooze? Give yourself a high five! Avoided screen time to do something more important? Congratulate yourself again. All these little celebrations add up and you start training yourself to see the positive things in your life.\n\nPicture yourself talking to the elementary school age version of yourself.\n\nCBT techniques and read Radical Self Compassion by Dr. Kristin Neff. Meditation: Eckhart Tolle The Power of Now. Anything by Dr. Martha Beck , especially Steering By Starlight. Be well.\n\nBoost\n\nRealize the complete irrationality of guilt\n\nI talk to myself a lot. I talk to myself about everything, the good, the bad, the negative. Just never too much of anything. Everytime I find myself taking everything too seriously I look around and I see people who have made msitakes (unintentional/intentional) and I see how I forget, forgave or moved on. I don't remeber anything that someone else did, so why am I embarassed about my mistakes? I have realised as human beings we tend to observe ourselves the most and hence we are most critical of our own selves primarily, it's an intuitive thing to want to improve and change. And the first thing to change anything is realisation. Realising that we are wrong hence where the critical self comes in. But hey don't get caught up in that take the next step, doesn't have to be a big step. Imagine what you'd like to show your negative self the next time you have a self talk. For example - If you want to stop eating Junk foood because you want to loose weight...you won;t quit eevrything the first day but you switched your chips for fruits and did not touch a chip packet. So tell yourself that.\n\nSo on slowly but steadily improve yourself. God Speed.\n\nAffirmations really helped me. i just went onto youtube and various meditation apps like Inisight Timer and found affirmation meditations i could listen to at night, either before bed or while i sleep. Writing your own affirmations, repeating them or re-reading them daily. Its all about creating new pathways in the brain. Just like how our environment and influences growing up can effect us and create a negative habits, pathways, patterns of doubt or self hate, create self defence mechanisms where you punish yourself before you can be punished by others - you have the same power to influence your mind just as much as things have influenced you as you grew as a person. Neuroplasticity can be empowering. And remember that the affirmations you listen to or write for yourself dont have to feel true in the moment, it might take weeks or months or years to shake how uncomfortable and unfamiliar a lot of them will feel to you, but the work is being done none the less.  Eventually it feels like something you will automatically think during moments you might have thought much different thoughts.  And remember that you can start small with the affirmations. As simple as stating neutral facts, to start. I Am a Person. My Humanity is Universal. I Deserve the Same Respect as Anyone.   My Body Keeps Me Moving.  You can wrap up some basic gratitude stuff into the affirmations. I am Grateful For My Arms and What They Carry. I am Grateful for my Legs Keeping Me Steady.  I am Grateful For My Senses And The Things They Allow Me To Enjoy.   Start wherever you feel comfortable. Ask yourself what you needed to hear from others growing up. Things you need to hear right now. It can be as simple as you want it to be. I started with things like I Am Safe.  I Am Calm. Even thought i didnt feel either of those things. Even just saying things like I Have The Means To Calm Myself, working more on a sense of believing you can get to a goal you have in mind.  In regards to specifically be kinder to yourself, affirmations about being capable and being a good person and deserving love will be helpful. And if you dont feel comfortable being kind yet, be neutral, express facts that are neither good nor bad, that are unifying and relatable to what you see in others and do not judge. Then work your way up to direct kindness.  You can also look into Self Compassion program by Kristin Neff, she has a website with a bunch of free resources regarding that topic.  Theres probably a fair amount of self compassion meditations out there too. Apologies if any of this info is redundant, I hope you are able to find something that helps.\n\nHealing is a life long journey mt friend - but I always recommend giving yourself some self compassion it goes a long way for one self - I recommend it to people starting their journeys - everything else will follow \nSelf care rituals, learn to love all of you, take care of yourself\n\nPositive affirmations and subliminals to train the unconscious mind. Rewrite the script for yourself. Practice mindfulness and try to catch yourself in any negative self talk and replace it with positive affirmations cheering yourself on. It will take time, but with persistence, you can achieve anything!\n\nTry this: https://insig.ht/Q6NIPcgCHIb\n\nBe kinder to yourself. Meditate on your desires on ideals or ideas you have that you speak about yourself. You are conditioned to messure and have ideas on how things should be and so on. You are The one holding on to those belief what things should be and so on.\n\nLike anything else. Practice a routine of mantra. One thing I‚Äôve learned the may help you, every time you think something negative, think about three positive things.\n\nLoving kindness meditation.\n\nYou need to talk in meditation or hypnosis to the part of you that's giving you the negative talk. Find out its intention (most likely it wants to protect you from getting hurt) and ask that part to change the way it protects you. Also you need to forgive yourself for the stuff you may feel guilty of. These two things usually help eliminate negative self-talk. Good luck!\n\nIn the last five years I have this habit of often swearing to and belittleing myself. This voice constantly saying \"you're dumb, you're an asshole, people don't like you\". It's not always and meditating helps, but it gets bad on other days and its ruing my relationship and my life.\n\nA lot of good advice here. In my case I had to get over a cultural stuff that made it very difficult to see myself as competent and good with a straight face. I looked at it from a few different angles which a didn't work but clearly work for some folks.  In the end it was a realization that as connected as we might feel at times we are in a sense alone in our own heads, so \".. if you are not going to be on your own side then who? If not now, when?\". This I coupled with \"taking in the good\" about my world and savouring those good things (small and great) and applied it to myself. Once I did that things came to within a few weeks BUT I must say: I'd been practising meditation and reading a lot of atomist/Epicurean philosophy for a couple of years  Also I'd had a \"revelatory \" conversation with someone where I'd been detailing my perceived failings in life. At the end of this they were like - yeah well you've done x,y,z and not done a,b,c by most folks measures you've been quite successful in life. I accepted this as they were pretty cluey and it hit me like \"Holy sh*t\" what have I been thinking all my life. This was a year or so before I went through the \"positive affirmation \" process or whatever you'd lije to call it. Point being two parts - 1 intellectual/cognitive acceptance that you're ok (OP it sounds lije you may be there) 2 habituating yourself to a knowledge and (perhaps privately - takes time and dedication) celebrate the good things you do and are. Good things like- I took my family down to the town I grew up and showed them the lake, I worked hard to clean up the kitchen before I left for work, I was thanked for chairing that meeting and I have no evidence to suggest they were lying about it, I cooked all the meals this month while my partner was sick. Don't be afraid of the I statements and don't negate the positive impact that those little things can  have on the world.\n\nOn a small piece of heavy weight paper write these words.\n‚ÄúI greatly love and accept myself, just the way I am.‚Äù\nFold it and put it in your pocket. When the negative thought comes in, reach into your pocket and read the note. Or simply say the words to yourself numerous times. It doesn‚Äôt matter what tone you take. You will see yourself more clearly. And exhale.\n\nMeditate on Jesus and the 10 commandments plus learn from Eckhart and Peterson both free on you Tube.\n\nYou can also put your hand on your heart, or smile everytime you catch yourself distracted while meditating, lost in thought, gently reminding yourself to come home.\n\nAllow yourself some grace\n\nSlow progress has been my experience. I resonate with your post as negative thinking, and self detrimental thoughts were my way of life. I was quick to deride myself in failure, or even just normal things, silently telling myself harshly, I‚Äôm stupid, why did I do that you idiot, you know; talk like that inside my brain. Totally self-defeating and unnecessary.\n\nYour question is how do I stop it? If I‚Äôm reading it correctly. I have no quick answer, just keep meditating would be my best advice, with whatever method you use and however you want to do it. if you‚Äôre lucky and you work at it, you may come to a point where you realize that you‚Äôre no longer doing it. My experience here, I‚Äôve been practicing over 1 years‚Ä¶ I look at it as a side effect of a good meditative practice. I didn‚Äôt get a shining light, or an emotional epiphany I just noticed I wasn‚Äôt doing it as much. And that‚Äôs awesome.\n\nRecognize unwelcomed/false/intrusive thoughts then combat each one with two positive/invited thoughts. Be able to tell your inner critic to settle down and be understanding.\n\nWhat I did that worked was replace my own ‚Äòinner monologue‚Äô with the words of Gurus, Sages, &amp; various canonical texts. Replacing our ‚Äòown‚Äô thinking with that of a higher quality is called a Jana Yoga practice. You can do it with anyone like a yoga/meditation instructor. When you start to notice ‚Äòyou are thinking‚Äô become consciously mindful of that and then immediately replace that thinking with the kind loving words of those other beings and texts. Over time you will find their words becoming the only words left in your mind as far as inner self talk is concerned. At that point you are a sattvic being.\n\nThere is only one kind of meditation that can dispel negative  thoughts, and that is actual meditation that transcends thought. We are not our thoughts yet people constantly think they own them all.\n\nDon‚Äôt listen to unkind voices. Ignore and reframe.  They belong probably to your parents or society.\n\nYour mind isn't really a tape recorder, and trying to re-write the script is exhausting. The more you try to \"overwrite\" certain ways of thinking, the more they'll present themselves. The easiest way to accomplish what you're trying to do is to withdraw belief from negative inner dialogue. If you shrug things off as meaningless and without any kind of fundamental validity, they simply won't affect you. You need to get into a kind of state of mind where you *could* theoretically have that voice all day, and it'll be as meaningless as cars passing by on the street. At some point, it will occur to you that it's been weeks since you even noticed any kind of negativity in your mind. Choosing what you invest your belief in is infinitely more powerful than trying to condition your inner voice through repetitive practice.\n\nOh idk fuck that bitch üòÇ jk idk but you just need to remember all the things you do for others, how hard you work, that you are a good person and deserve self kindness! Because people are not kind!! You can't depend on others! Be your own best friend. It's a lonely life but at least you don't get hurt by fuckin douchebag assholes. Just saying ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüíØ\n\nThere are lots of Loving Kindness practices.\nYou have to find one that works for you.\n\nI have taken the basic Loving Kindness mantra/meditation and mixed it with a visualization and a song that creates a quivering heart.\n\nThat might work for you.\n\nI use Foreigner's I want to know what live is\nI visualize myself singing/asking my mother to show me what love is \nThen I visualize her singing/asking me to show her what love is\nThen I visualize us holding hands and looking out to the universe, God, the power of Humanity \nBoth singing and asking to be shown love.\n\nIt takes me about 10 minutes and I feel healed and loved\n\nMaybe this will inspire you to develop a practice that heals you\n\nOne thing that has helped me is, rather than try to avoid the negative thinking, just sit and listen to what it has to say. I'm not saying to believe it to be the truth, but acknowledge it, consider it deeply, then make a logical decision on how to move forward.\n\nI feel that a lot of negative 'self-talk' or thoughts are really just negative emotions that are being repressed to some degree. Anyone feel free to correct me if you think otherwise.\n\nYou have the power to change what you say, only you know how hard you‚Äôve worked, what battles you‚Äôd fought and you should always look back on those as wins cause your still here and still wanting to do better. I absolutely lovedddd the book ‚Äúyou are a badass‚Äù by Jen Sincero. Changed my thought patterns when I use to struggle with it too. \n\nThe other advice I saw was on TikTok, to name your rude, delusional, negative internal comments as a person so you can be like ‚Äúwow, ‚Ä¶. Is being really mean. I bet she wants ‚Ä¶‚Äù \n\nAnd it comes with time &lt;3\n\nHow would you speak to your best friend about the same thing?\n\nMaybe your inner voice is not kind since you are not kind to your inner voice? Maybe he is never heard so his only way out is negativity?\n\nHere‚Äôs my idea: Notice, then correct.\nSo, your first auto thought is a conditioned one. Maybe negative towards you or negative about someone or thing. When you notice, replace with neutral objective thought. Or, simply say, my inner voice is telling me ___. That‚Äôs unkind and I don‚Äôt agree. Interrupting and rephrasing can help I‚Äôve found\n\nThere's two parts to that. Deconstructing the negative thinking, and reconstructing the positive thinking. Bog standard mindfulness meditation can be good for the deconstruction part. Loving kindness meditation perhaps is good for the constructive part, as it helps you foster a feeling of love for all beings. Loving kindness is often found as part of the standard mindfulness curriculum.\n\nSeveral people have suggested affirmation and it's the top comment which is why I want to just say that Buddhist and Hindu monks and traditional teachers look at affirmations as a strange Western take on mantra at best. Even then, mantra is only one form of meditation and it's not even the one that *specifically and explicitly* aims to cultivate self-love and goodwill, and through that cultivate goodwill for all beings, that would be Metta. I strongly urge you to practice Metta meditation to develop self-love instead of rebranded \"think positive thoughts\" exercises, source: Used to believe in \"think positive\" but that ship sank, have been using metta to develop self-love, kindness, and goodwill, and kindness and goodwill for others for a few years now and the results I feel would have seemed unreal from where I was four years ago.  \n  \nedit: if you have any history of childhood trauma or emotional neglect, also look into re-parenting.\n\nI use this reminder fr Miguel Ruiz's Mastery of Love for any activity: I am doing this because I love myself, not because I can love myself. \n\nSomehow it helps me\n\nStop yelling at it to do better!\n\nI was the leader of negative thinking at one point in my life. Continuously beating myself up for something or the other. Than these words from a wise man I know totally changed it for me. \n\nHe said, see if you try harm somebody in this world, they have a defence against you. They will try to fight. Even if you try to harm something as small as an ant, it will defend itself and fight back. \n\nBut your own being is absolutely defenceless. It‚Äôs completely at the mercy of your mind. How can you harm something that has no defence of it‚Äôs own. Then I suddenly felt so sad for myself and I started crying. In that moment I decided, I will never EVER put myself down. EVER again. No matters what happens. And till to this day I have only protected my being and held it very sacred. Something like a flower that shouldn‚Äôt be crushed. My life became beautiful after that.\n\nPractice mindfulness to observe your throughts without judgement, for within the stillness lies the wisdom of the soul. Meditation becomes the gentle breeze that quiets the mundane chatte, allowing the garden of kindness and self-compassion to bloom in the fertile soil of heart. And also pray more, and surrender to God :)\n\nYou can't erase the subconscious mind so you have to overwrite it.  How I did it - sleep affirmations.   The best, fastest I've found is \"minds in unison sleep hypnosis\" on YouTube.  Not the subliminals.  You can hear him talking.  Just turn it down low and make sure you're good and tired before you start it.  It's important that they are \"you are\" affirmations.\n\nClearing your mind ‚Ä¶Zen\nAlso reprogramming your mind.  Put a Rubber band around the wrist, flick every time you catch yourself having a negative thought.  I used this for a month, it was amazing\n\nAlso positive affirmations about yourself.  Repeat repeat in the morning middle of day and before bed( all day) .\n\nADHD medication,\n\nHigher self guided meditation\n\nAstral projection guided meditation\n\nI dont like to be kind to myself.\n\nIf I hear my inner voice saying \"it's OK to procrastinate\" I, the awareness, usually say \"off yourself\".\n\nBeing kind to \"someone\", I, awareness, hate, doesn't work for me"

Thank you üôè\n\nnice gonna check this out.\n\nThank you\n\nNice!\n\nJust downloaded, good work bud!\n\nJust downloaded!! Will try it out! Thank you!!\n\nJust downloaded. Thanks for sharing üôèüèº\n\nAny android?\n\nDownloaded!\n\nThank you\n\nLovely thanksÔºÅ\n\nWill try! Thank you\n\nWhat a great job! Thank you for sharing.\n\nWell done I'm proud of youüëèüå∏I appreciate it, thank you‚òÄÔ∏èüôèüèºüå∏\n\nOh, very cool! Thanks!\n\nNice app graphic! Too bad I can‚Äôt download the app on older iOS, like iOS 14 üëéüèº\n\nupdate your phone brother, it's not realistic for app devs to support massive range of OS versions\n\nSo everyones supposed to shit out $1500+ for a new phone because developers can‚Äôt make apps work with all iOS? That bullshit man. I know for a fact it can be done. I assume it‚Äôs Apple that forces them to do it so people a forced to constantly keep updating their phones. I‚Äôd rather just not use/support those apps and developers. Much easier then buying a new phone every 1-2 years when the phone I have still works perfectly well.\n\nSorry to swoop in with immediate criticism. But if you really want to improve peoples experience with the app, I‚Äôd try and see if you can find a way to work in some binaural beats. Completely changes my meditation.\n\nNo problem, I appreciate the idea and will consider it.\n\nPost this on LoA and NevilleGoddard subs\n\nThank you!\n\nThank you Austin! I appreciate the simplicity and privacy!\nOne small request I hope you can consider in the future, I keep my iPhone on Silent (vibrate only) mode to prevent distracting audible notifications, but like it when media playing apps still play sounds. \nIt would be great if the app played the start and end sounds regardless of the phone silent mode. Especially since you already have a sound/vibrate control inside the app. \nI hope I make sense. \nThank you!\n\nGreat smooth experience, thank you so much for creating this! I felt so satisfied to delete the bloated Insight Timer app I was using!\n\nThe iPhone already has a timer. \n\nThis trend of accessorizing mediation so misses the point. The first bullet point being a nice UI is a great example of that.\n\nThere is no app for that. Unplug, sit in silence for a while and stop trying to min max existence and just exist.\n\nPeople attempting to maximize meditation's efficiency are only shooting themselves in the foot.\n\nJust be.\n\nWhat is the point in gatekeeping like this lol, it‚Äôs a simple app with a simple purpose. No one is saying or claiming it ‚Äúmaximizes the efficiency with which you meditate‚Äù‚Ä¶\n\nIf you don‚Äôt personally like it just don‚Äôt use it man, other people like myself can find it very useful, and well, just fun considering I use a timer for my sessions anyways and the stock standard clocks or apps can be finicky/designed to do more than just be a simple timer.\n\nWhere do you get that I'm gate keeping from? I said nothing even remotely along those lines. Why are you starting a response from a judgement with a lie?\n\nSeriously, how could you have so catastrophically misread my comment where you think that? \n\nIf you tell me what I meant or how I feel about this despite my comments that I am not emotional about this then you have nothing to add to a conversation with me. \n\nThere is no purpose to these apps that has any functional bearing on meditation in any way that aren't already met by things that exist already.\n\nThis is pure distraction, go log off and sit for a bit.\n\nPlease do not under any circumstances respond emotionally because all you seem to care about is spreading negativity.\n\nI just want to make sure people know that there are no 'things' that will help you meditate.\n\nBuddy ‚Äúmaking sure that people know no things will help them meditate‚Äù is gatekeeping - you aren‚Äôt the arbiter of meditation and how people engage with it. I use a timer and feel I need it to get into a truly meditative state - who are you to say I‚Äôm doing it wrong? \n\nChill out, there was no real effective point to your first comment aside from throwing shade. Based on our comments it seems like whatever form of meditation you practice hasn‚Äôt served you as well as my timer-using novice version of meditation has done for me :)\n\n?\n\nGatekeeping is when someone says \"you aren't a true meditator this is what true meditation is\"\n\nAll I said is \"you don't need an app\"\n\nCan you please come back to the real universe? The one you're making up with these lies is not working for me.\n\nEvery comment you have made is dripping with judgement and baseless accusations of things you don't seem to understand. \n\nIf this is what your meditation practice has given you I think you may want to work on it a bit more.\n\n[deleted]\n\nIt really is the new Zen. My own son tries to troll me sometimes to be expected of course but it's quite easy to shut that down just by responding calmly. The hard part is responding calmly :)\n\nMy post was completely emotionally neutral and the amount of emotional casting going on here is pretty typical. \n\nIt's pure judgement.\n\nWhat I've said is observably true and can be validated by anyone that has a phone.\n\nGuess we can't have nice conversations even here.\n\nThere are undoubtedly ‚Äúthings‚Äù that will help someone meditate.\n\nAnything that encourages meditation, or makes it easier/more convenient to meditate would be very helpful.¬†\n\nYou got your head way up your own ass.\n\nThose things are only symbols for the thoughts we have. The symbols themselves are not required. Only the thought matters.\n\nIf you proceed without understanding that you will never understand anything\n\nBased on your last line there you don't have very much add here.\n\nGot a real internet monk over here, folks.¬†\n\nEach individuals capacity at understanding this depends on the kinds of experiences they've had in life. \n\nYou can not be told this, these words are meaningless, it is the realization of the nature of your own thoughts as you look at them that bring can you wisdom from meditation.\n\nUnderstanding this text in the context of your own thoughts, you will find wisdom there.\n\nBut not from me.\n\nDoes this make me a monk? I'm not sure I find the label in my context meaningful, though I do say my ego does find it flattering. \n\nStill haven't killed that all the way yet but I'm working on it. The death throws are a struggle.\n\nYou've got a real 'holier-than-thou' vibe going on.  It's distasteful.\n\nGiving a judgemental insult in a meditation group to a person that wrote multiple paragraphs with good intent is not the kind of behavior I care to interact with. \n\nWould you care to change to the positive mindset I had in my mind when I wrote that?\n\nThat is a much less distasteful place.\n\nI am no one from no where but I am at peace when I think this way. \n\nI think it is a good way to think. Do you? \n\nTry it, it costs nothing and you only have to shift a few of these silly symbols we use to represent words around a little differently. \n\nHave a little fun with it maybe. This tension you bring will destroy whatever it is you consider your soul.\n\nLighten up, touch grass. Spread a little joy even in the face of misery. What you put out is all the world sees.\n\nNow reflect on your behavior. \n\nWhat do you think the world sees?"

    "title": "For those of you having doubts, here's my story. ",
    "body": "Since my early twenties, I've been managing depression and anxiety and recently have been diagnosed as Bipolar II. I may not agree with that recent diagnosis but pathologically, all the signs were there. I believe my conditions formed due to physical and mental abuse as a child, for a number of years, from my Catholic school teacher in the 1980's.\n\nThen in 2018, I almost died from Heart Failure as a result of a viral infection that triggered Dilated Cardio Myopathy. At the time I was an internationally competitive athlete (intentionally vague for anonymity). It completely rocked my world. The subsequent year of recovery, was filled with terror that the next chest pain, indigestion, heart burn, or palpitation, was the end. I was functioning at 15%EF at diagnosis. \n\nAs a result of this ongoing terror, I tried to take my life. Fortunately, an intervention saved me and I was hospitalised. As part of that recovery I was introduced to Mindfulness and Meditation. It was pretty basic body scan stuff but I found an instant relationship with it. I heard my true voice for the first time in my life and he was basically a traumatised child. \n\nSince 2018, I have meditated every day. EVERY DAY. Because it saved me. I followed Buddhism (not suggesting anything here) and Meditation became an integral part of my daily routine. It clarified the world of reactions and expectations for me. It dulled challenging emotions and allowed me to extract meaning and truth from those challenging events. \n\nWe all have ANTs (Automatic Negative Thoughts), and they stem from long held core beliefs. With meditation you can look deeply into those beliefs and forgive yourself and begin to heal. Please, please, stick with it and you will stick around. \n\nI quit my corporate job and for the past 4 years I have been teaching Meditation and Mindfulness to people all over the world. I am a Life Transformation Coach now. I will keep you all in my thoughts as I meditate and hope you all find the clarity you are seeking. ‚ù§Ô∏è",

    "all_comment_text": "Thank you for the encouragement.\n\nThis is a book advert disguised as encouragement.\n\nI'm sorry you feel that way. It's just a fact. It adds to what I've learned over the years. I'll edit it so you can feel more comfortable.\n\nWhat book?\n\nI had mentioned I was writing a book but removed it so my post didn't come across as a promotion.\n\nHey, if the book helps people, who cares?\n\nThank you so much for sharing your story.  Sending love and pratmy I can acheive the same inner peace i have been looking for.  Just started meditation 5 weeks ago and making it a new daily practice\n\nYou're most welcome.\n\nYou are worthy, you are capable, and you are already doing what it takes to get there. Every ocean is made of little drops. Keep it up.\n\nWould you mind sharing what your daily routine looks like?\n\nSure. I wake around 7am. I count down from 10 and tell myself to have my feet on the ground by 1. I go to my balcony for 15 minutes and sit there and listen to everything with eyes closed. I'm just trying to start my day by taking in sounds and resisting the urge to label them as pleasant or disturbing. Birds sound the same as cars to me now.\n\nDuring my day, which is at the moment spent writing, I'll take 30-45mins out for my meditation, which will always vary depending on my mood. If I'm stressed, I'll focus on the body. If I'm lazy, I'll focus on motivation. If I'm feeling sorry for myself, metta always heals me.\n\nAt several points in the day I'll have opportunities to do mindful exercises. I loooove washing dishes, doing laundry, cleaning the apartment, all the jobs that people dislike, I do slowly, deliberately and mindfully. I especially make tea and coffee this way, as well as preparing food and eating it. You'd be amazed how much you can amplify those little experiences by being fully present and not worrying about that email you got an hour ago.\n\nThen before bed, I do a full body scan and direct my breath towards any areas of pain or tension. My knees are getting all my attention recently, post surgery. In bed, I pick 5 things I'm grateful for and loop them in my head until I drift off. My ways are not perfect and won't suit everyone but I did the same when I used to work in the corporate world. Everyone can make the time. If they can't, then they need the time more than those who can.\n\nI hope this was helpful.\n\nThanks for sharing.\n\nIf you love doing all those things that so many people find annoying, that's a really good sign. Since they need to be done regardless, you might as well enjoy it!\n\nWell done. My routine is similar to yours. I have a heart condition that freaks me out sometimes, particularly at bedtime when everything quiets down and any tiny thing that feels a little 'off' becomes magnified. Well done! Keep it up.\n\nThank you.\n\nI understand your current situation and I deeply hope for health and happiness in your life.\n\nYour story reminds me of one I heard about a Tibetan monk who became paralyzed from the waist down after a fall off a mountainside. An interviewer asked him if he was happy and he replied \"Yes, I am. I might as well be, since I have no choice!\" Then he laughed. Like the songs says, take those broken wings and learn to fly.\n\nThat's such a beautiful attitude, right? It would have been easier for him to feel victimised. Yet the choice demonstrated an incredible I ner strength.\n\nThanks for sharing! Do you remember approximately how long it took before you experienced profound changes?\n\nWell, it's argued that change begins the moment you choose it. But we, in our nature, are slow to adopt long-term, apparent change. I would say I noticed profound change after 2-3 months of practice. The initial stages were filled with frustration and infrequent moments of peace. One day though, when I was driving to work and some mindless person almost sideswiped me on the motorway. I instinctively drove defensively, took a deep breath and didn't respond... apart from a quick wave to notify them it was OK.\n\nOld me would have ripped the roof off his car. And what good would that have done anyone? It was a subtle action that day but saved me a lot of energy.\n\nHave you experienced improvements in day-to-day happiness and mood? I don't have much trouble controlling anger, but find that I feel sad, frustrated or in a low mood more often than I would like. I recently started meditation.\n\nBasically, yes. I'm happier day-to-day but happiness for me is the absence of high and low emotions. It's contentment with everything as it is, right now. \n\nAnd honestly, I can have days where I mostly feel sad. But it's ok to feel that way for a day. You just have to ensure that you are paying attention to the feeling and forgiving yourself for feeling but also actively trying to reframe your mindset.\n\nFor this, I start questioning the feeling. Where do I feel it? What is the sensation? Is it numbness, aching, pounding, tingling? What's it trying to tell me? If I can't find a definitive answer, I just accept it and comfort it with loving kindness.\n\nActually, the next time you experience it, try Metta Meditation. My clients love it and it's one if my go to meditations for heavy days.\n\nIn one of your replies you mentioned labeling and questioning any emotions which come up during meditation. You said the emotion may or may not carry a message.\n\nMy question is this: how do you determine which messages are worth listening to and which aren't? And what happens if your thoughts try to trick you by preying on what you hold the dearest?\n\nI've suffered with anxiety/depression/OCD for years and one of the hardest recurring challenges for me is constant negative thoughts which spiral in on themselves. They have taken many forms throughout the years and have caused countless neuroses and misery for me.\n\nFor example I've had phases where I've had a crippling fear of death; health anxiety (worried about permanently losing my mind); anxiety over food and eating, etc.\n\nBut the worst and most persistent thing for me is the negative thoughts which seem to poison everything I enjoy. This has made me struggle with relationships - I end up with a huge fear of commitment because my anxiety will spew thoughts at me like \"you're not ready for a serious relationship\", \"if you get married you'll regret it forever\", \"you don't really love her\", etc. etc.\n\nFor me this is easily the most disturbing thing because it produces all these negative thoughts about subjects so close to your heart. And I think that is the reason these thoughts are particularly venomous and difficult to ignore, because the subjects of them are so important to you. They have such a strong impact on you that they become difficult to ignore, and even difficult to determine if they are really \"just\" negative thoughts.\n\nLogically, I can distance myself from my anxiety and look at these thoughts and say \"I have been here before. I've repeated this self-destructive pattern for years, and all that's happening now is just a repeat of what happened before.\" But because the emotions these thoughts provoke are *so* gut-wrenching, logic seems to go out the window, and the thoughts seem to carry more weight.\n\nSo I hope you see what I mean when I ask the question: how do you determine which thoughts are \"real\" and worth listening to? And how do you determine which questions to ask them? Because from experience, I can tell you that negative/anxious thoughts can certainly masquerade very effectively as \"real\".\n\nPlease tell me if that all makes sense, and thanks.\n\nFirstly, thank you for sharing so much with me and for everyone else to see. I know how you feel. I understand your thinking. I have lived the same patterns that you so clearly have described. I see you.\n\nSecondly, I need you to understand that I would never advocate that meditation is a one-stop-shop, cure-all remedy for mental health issues. It is merely a supplement, to assist inner peace and mental wellbeing, in conjunction with licensed therapy or medical psychiatry. If you truly feel that your thoughts and emotions are crippling your enjoyment of life, then please my friend, seek professional care. The root cause and core beliefs that you hold are discoverable and subject to modifications. \n\nIf I were a personal trainer and you were presenting issues with thyroid, diabetes or heart disease, I would never tell you to just lift weights: you would see a doctor to ensure you're well enough to begin lifting. Therefore, in order for you to begin your mental weight lifting, it is highly recommended to resolve what's unhealthy in your thought processes through investigative therapy(CBT, ACT, DBT). What you're describing your current mindset as is what I underwent for decades. When I pinpointed the source core belief, I began forgiveness, acceptance, and healing. \n\nYour inner child is shouting at you and you can't even hear your true inner dialogue. Your thoughts are trying to protect you from harm but in doing so, they're preventing you from experiencing life fully. You need to start interrogation. As an example, your thoughts of:\n\n\"I'm not ready for a serious relationship.\" \n\nHere‚Äôs how the questioning could flow with potential answers:\n\n1. What does it mean to me if I'm not ready for a serious relationship?\n\nIt means I might fail or get hurt.\n\n\n\n2. What would it mean to me if I fail or get hurt in a relationship?\n\nIt would mean that I‚Äôm not good enough or capable of maintaining a healthy relationship.\n\n\n\n3. What does it mean if I‚Äôm not good enough or capable of maintaining a healthy relationship?\n\nIt means I‚Äôm flawed or not deserving of love.\n\n\n\n4. What would it mean if I‚Äôm flawed or not deserving of love?\n\nIt would mean I‚Äôll be alone and unloved. \n\n\nThis process exposes deeper fears or core beliefs that may be driving the surface belief of not being ready. So, you could potentially be really feeling that \"you feel alone and unloved.\" Can you think of an example where that statement is not true? If yes, then you know using your intellect that it's false. This process is slow at the beginning but becomes automatic with continued practice. Look at it this way if you put the same energy into this thought process, as you are putting into your current or previous thought process, how much better do you think you would feel. It's worth effort, right? \n\nApplying this to most thoughts helps to weed out the sneaky, masquerading thoughts. You set a standard for yourself for the quality of thoughts that are allowed to get your attention. If their intention is to make you feel regret, fear, doubt, anger, then hit them with interrogation. And even if you mess up sometimes, that's OK too. You were never meant to be perfect. But you are trying and that to me is beautiful my friend. You are trying to make the world a better place for everyone around you by being the best version of yourself. \n\nKeep strong. Stay determined. The fight may not get easier, but I promise you, if you keep going with love, compassion, and resilience in your heart, you can do this. I'm proud of you already for getting this far. Please let me know how you progress.\n\nTo add to this, regarding your question about which message to listen to, be diligent here. After you apply your interrogational questioning, if the message is irrational, non-beneficial, or not rooted in your best interests, it's merely emotive. Wisdom trumps emotion. Emotion is an ego ingredient. Your real self is more interested in compassion, clarity, and kindness.\n\nThank you so much for replying so quickly and so thoughtfully. I really appreciate it and I'm really grateful that you care so much about people's struggles.\n\nRegarding therapy, you're totally right and I hear what you're saying. My country's medical system is not the best so I've found it difficult to access anything more than very basic CBT talk therapy. It's not been worthless but I think I've learned more from books and reading online. I may have to look into private or remote therapy.\n\nI think I have a grasp on what some of my core issues are but I'm still not sure what to do with them. \n\nSome of my core issues, I think, have always been rooted in selfishness, laziness, and hedonism. Since I was very young I distinctly remember doing everything possible to seek the easiest, most comfortable, most pleasurable life. As a child that meant I hated school and was a serial procrastinator. I would delay doing work as much as possible to the point where I'd feel massive anxiety from the pressure of looming deadlines.\n\nSometimes when I was supposed to be doing work I would make lists of things I enjoyed doing and think about how much I wanted to get back to doing them.\n\nEven when I did something I enjoyed I would ask myself if there was a \"better\" way of doing it. I started to \"schedule\" pleasurable activities in a way that I now realise isn't healthy. For example instead of playing a video game when I got it, I'd save it until the weekend or until the summer holiday because I felt I wouldn't get the maximum enjoyment out of it if I had other non-pleasurable things to do. Sundays were the worst day of the week. I'd lament the end of the weekend because it meant going back to school. I started dreading Monday, often feeling physically ill at the thought of being taken away from the comfort of home and the lack of obligations.\n\nMy struggle to avoid anything I disliked (or maximise what I liked) continued like this. It seems to have shaped my entire childhood and has carried over into adulthood. Decades later I still repeat those same patterns today, and have designed almost my entire life around the same tenets of minimising discomfort and maximising pleasure. I know it's unhealthy; I know it's unrealistic; I even recognise how it's counter-productive and is actually *reducing* my happiness and pleasure, but that part of my brain which seems to have been shaped in childhood still says \"why *wouldn't* you keep choosing pleasure?\"\n\nYou know the phrase \"comparison is the thief of joy\"? That also plays a huge part. Even if I'm doing something I enjoy, my mind is always thinking \"how could this be better?\" even if I'm already pretty happy with something.\n\n* \"This gourmet meal I cooked would taste better if [it was made by a chef in a professional kitchen]\"\n* \"This great game would be more enjoyable if [I had a $3000 graphics card]\"\n* \"This loving relationship would be better if [my girlfriend had the body and sex drive of a pornstar]\"\n\nSo having said all that, I hope you might understand why I struggle with combating negative thoughts, because no matter how much I question them and label them, my brain always reduces things to a question of \"Will this give you maximum pleasure? Will this require effort? Will this make you feel discomfort? Would something else be better?\"\n\nTo use the interrogation technique you suggested as an example, it might go like this:\n\n* \"I'm afraid to commit to a lifelong relationship.\"\n   * What does it mean if I'm afraid of a lifelong relationship?\n* It means I'm scared that there could be someone else who could fulfill my needs better.\n   * What does it mean if I feel like there could be someone else who could fulfill my needs better?\n* It means I'm scared that I might feel dissatisfied in some way with my partner.\n   * What does it mean if I feel dissatisfied with my partner?\n\nIt's at this point my brain would jump in like \"Aha! I knew there was something wrong with your relationship! See, you're dissatisfied! You think someone else could be better! That must mean you secretly hate your partner! Your relationship is doomed! You know somewhere out there is the perfect woman just waiting to fulfill your every desire and make your life perfect!\"\n\nWhen in reality, the answer to the question is \"I have had unrealistic expectations about pleasure since I was a child and I have the pathological tendency to feel dissatisfied with everything in my life because of it.\"\n\nSo is that what you would call the intellectual response? Should I be focusing on that and aiming for that as the automatic response?\n\nAbsolutely, that would be an excellent intellectual response. It's full of awareness, acknowledgement, and acceptance. All that's missing is forgiveness and action.\n\nYou have displayed to me here, incredible insight and emotional intelligence. You have identified many instances and clearly understand your irrational behaviours. Action is the next step.\n\nChoose something small that you know you will deeply derive pleasure from, and resist it. Then indulge yourself in something else. Then later, increase the pleasure return, and resist again. Just like in weight training, slowly increase the weight over weeks and months and your strength will inevitably grow.\n\nI can also recommend a good book to help you reframe your thoughts. Reframe Your Brain by Scott Adams. There are some great techniques in there, that you can convert into meditations. Eventually you will derive pleasure from resisting hedonistic activities.\n\nIt will take time and perseverance and I know you can do it. I believe it.\n\nThanks so much. I appreciate you wanting to help people.\n\nI can so relate to what you shared about laziness, trying to avoid the hard things, etc.   Can you share a little more about your journey to overcome this through mindfulness?\n\nA beginner in meditation should focus on which thing for meditation i.e. sound music breath etc???\n\nThe breath is always recommended as it's a constant which happens automatically but can also be manually manipulated. But for me, I like to watch the activity of the mind. Witness your thoughts as an observer of them. It's as if you are literally taking a step back from your inner dialogue and just listening to and observing it. Watch how it's constantly changing. Notice if you cling onto a particular thought. If you do cling, catch yourself and focus back to the breath and then the activity of the mind again. You don't fail, you simply try.\n\nOne more thing brother.When i finish my meditation,i felt some sense of relaxation along with a grief in my heart...and felt like crying....can you tell me what is it and how to deal with it??\n\nFirstly, crying is OK. I have cried many times during and after. Never feel like you have to suppress or judge an emotion that arises. Sit with it and notice how it feels in the body and what sensation it creates. Ask it questions. Label it but don't identify with it. It's an emotion. It's not you. It may carry a message, it may not. As for the source, it's difficult for me to pinpoint it without a longer chat. \n\nMore often than not, it could be a long held core belief or a hidden trauma coming to the surface. Or you could simply be sad! Either is OK, but if it persists and affects your ability to function in the world, always consider speaking with a licensed therapist to get to the root cause.\n\nGo easy on yourself and forgive yourself the moment you feel you've faltered.\n\nSadhu (x3) üôèüôèüôè\n\nWhy not ordain?\n\nThe ascetic life was even too much for Buddha at times. üòÇ\n\nI'm happy being a boddhisatva for now. üôèüôèüôè\n\nThe ascetic life was before Buddha made the guidelines for the life of a Buddhist monk, before he found the path. He tortured himself and almost died from hunger. A Buddhist monk, on the other hand, follows the middle way between asceticism and indulgence. E.g. you have some limitations conducive to meditation like being celibate, but are not torturing yourself and can, for example, eat two meals a day after sunrise and before noon. He did not stop living like that till he died. So the life of a Buddhist monk was not too much for him.\n\n\nRegarding the teaching of meditation and mindfulness, my Burmese teacher advised me actually not to teach, first become a monk and study and then teach. Otherwise you can scare people away from meditation or confuse them. My Western teacher is okay with sharing what you know with others if you have some experience. I do kind a see where the Burmese teacher is coming from, after studying and practicing (in the Burmese case for dhammacariya) you can be a much better teacher than without. But on the other hand I might stay in this life as well and then share in my own way as the Western teacher says.\n\nthis is really interesting and helpful thankyou i have been doing consistent practice for a few weeks now i notice subtle benefits but i would would really like to achieve a better understanding of my self and let go of my limiting beliefs. At the moment the meditation is just a part of my routine 2 times a day for 10-15 minutes i would really like to go deeper would you recommended increasing the time i meditate for ?\n\nAs long as you are actively trying to maintain conscious awareness, absolutely you can increase the time. Quality is always better than quantity. Some days when I have the luxury of time, I will do 45mins and more, but as soon as I lose complete focus and discipline, I'll stop.\n\nChallenge yourself with an eyes open meditation or a noisy location. Every minute that you can focus on your mind's activity or your breath in those scenarios, is worth 10 minutes of complete silent meditation.\n\nI have a question for you. I have a hard time meditating or manifesting anything and I‚Äôm told it‚Äôs likely because of unresolved childhood trauma. My memories of my childhood are mainly positive. I was raised by a single mother but was always surrounded by tons of aunts, uncles and cousins. I only have happy memories of my childhood. Is it possible my limited beliefs are cause by some trauma that I‚Äôm blocking out? Is there any way to find this out?\n\nFor this I would definitely recommend Psychotherapy. Specifically CBT. You may benefit from Downward Arrow/Laddering questioning to get to your core beliefs. You'll be very surprised how well it works. Next, I would recommend ACT, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy. Because you're going to need to accept whatever surfaces and learn to survive with it, but without letting it control your emotions.\n\nIt's almost impossible to remove all trauma. We simply learn how to manage it and grow stronger in the process. After that, I'm very sure your meditation will flow smoothly. Until then, keep trying, sit with any frustration you notice, forgive yourself, keep compassion at heart, and keep going. üôè\n\nThank you for your response. I will definitely look into that. I‚Äôd really like to know if I‚Äôm blocking something.\n\nYou have been through a lot, you understand a lot and experience a lot consciously.\n\n\n\nThe only doubt I have taken from your story is the fear of death.\n\n\n\nEspecially during meditation, we can feel that we are more than just a physical body.\n\nThanks for your input. If you could please clarify for me the doubt regarding fear of death. Are you saying that you do/don't fear it or that I do/don't. \n\nDeath for me, at my current stage in life, is no longer fearful. Having escaped it so narrowly, gave me a forced perspective of acceptance. There's nothing I can do to evade it or avoid it. I know that's an obvious statement but we always think it happens to other people, not us. \n\nI often meditate on death, using buddhist methods, seeing the body as putrid, decaying, and merely a vehicle. And yes, I believe that what we truly are is an aspect of a combined consciousness that extends to the ends of the universe. Crazy right? But no one can prove me wrong and I can't prove I'm right.\n\nMaybe, but for me such a release is to go beyond the body and gain a non-corporeal experience of my consciousness, I don't have to die to touch it with my mind in its purest form.\n\nThat's beautiful.\n\nI saw the fear of death in your post. It may be the effect of working through only some of the traumas. Because death is a punishment, the annihilation of the physical body, as a punishment.\n\nI understand, thanks for clarifying.\n\nThank you so much for this beautiful thread. I want to get into meditation teaching and coaching. Can you detail how you became certified and what your work life balance is like? \nI would love to be a part of this community for as long as possible and I‚Äôm a natural teacher. I don‚Äôt know how to make it work.\n\nI used The School of Positive Transformation for my certification as it's IMMA accredited and globally recognised. It's deep on its research based evidence of the benefits of M&amp;M. It takes 1 month online to complete. Well worth it. \n\nI started by offering my services for free to my work colleagues to help them with stress. It snowballs from there to more regular clientele outside of work hours. \n\nThen I reached out to corporate organisations, specifically their HR or Engagement Teams and offer workshops for them. You will pick up regular gigs there as well as individual clients.\n\nI work maybe 2-3 hours a day, then spend the rest writing. I'll have weekly group sessions that see me through the week financially but my focus now is on growing my business and writing more. Eventually I'll break into social media and Spotify and books.\n\nCongratulations on this huge change in your life ‚ù§Ô∏èüóøüôè\n\nI'm trying to get into teaching for a living for the past 3 years and I haven't found the niche yet. But I feel like I'm close, I won't stop because I love it\n\nThank you.\n\nLoving what you're doing is crucial for your happiness and will, I believe, bring with it success, fulfillment and purpose.\n\nNamaste.\n\nI have ADHD and it‚Äôs nearly impossible. I will continue to make it my mission but any suggestions on how to overcome one the adhd challenge in mediation are most welcome.\n\nYes, that is very challenging. But that 'nearly' you stated, that's a key word. Meaning it's not completely impossible. I can however reassure you that there are studies that show how ADHD can benefit from meditation. The pre-frontal cortex is developed more and dopamine levels can increase, which I believe helps with ADHD.\n\nYou can try Moving Meditation if you find sitting too difficult. Go for a walk and try to harmonise your breathing in alignment with your steps. So you would walk slowly, count your steps, 1, 2, 3, 4,... and your inbreath will last for that duration, then breathe out, 1, 2, 3, 4, and your outbreath will match that count.\n\nWhen your mind begins to wander, always come back to your breath, your steps, and start counting again.\n\nTry it and let me know how it goes. Good luck.\n\nThank you. I will try this.\n\nDo you have a YouTube channel¬ø\n\nNot just yet. It's under construction. I'm in my writing mindset at the moment and it's taking most of my energy.\n\nHow do you not fall asleep?\n\nI place my hands in such a position that I'm always aware of their position. My left hand goes on my lap, palms facing up. Then I place my right hand on top of my left palm. Both thumbs meet at the top to form a kind of triangle. The pressure at the tip of my thumbs becomes my anchor. I frequently bring my attention back to it to make sure they haven't fallen apart or that I'm not pressing too firmly.\n\nPlus I sit kind of uncomfortably to deliberately keep my self alert.\n\nIs it true that the state you get to once you resist the urge to fall asleep is the goal? Like you can‚Äôt reach that until you have pushed past drowsing off?\n\nHonestly, I don't set goals or believe in goals for meditation. If you don't reach a goal, you feel like a failure. There is no failing in meditation, only noticing. If you want to set a goal, make it to notice when you are feeling sleepy and adjust your position slightly and refocus to your breath. Then you'll have achieved it.\n\nAlmost sent a list of new questions focused on how to thrive without setting goals in life.. until I reread the first line focused on meditation lol. \nThat makes a lot of sense, thank you!"

    "all_comment_text": "Because I can hear my thoughts and decide whether or not to allow them to hijack my emotions.. \n\nSometimes I have thoughts come in that make me laugh.. Sometimes some of them make me feel scared.. All emotions are offered up as different thoughts. \n\nIf you have not got the realisation down your thoughts are just suggestions to feel and you have a choice to either transmute it if it‚Äôs gone to far or deny it before it hijacks you if your powerful enough.. \n\nStart out looking at your thoughts like suggestions. Thoughts are like passing cars.. \n\nPretty soon you start interacting with your thoughts differently. \n\nOnce you gain control and deny the negative strongly enough it stops showing up because it knows it will be rejected by you. \n\nThe conscious observer.\n\nLove this idea of looking at thoughts as suggestions!\n\nIt‚Äôs not my original idea. This is the basis of alchemy. If your not in control of your emotions your not in control of the chemicals released into your body through negative emotions. \n\nLook at the word disease. DIS EASE. Feel dis ease long enough it will cause disease. \n\nIt sure was a game changer for me when I took this stuff on board.. My mind blows daily. Everyday is a school day.\n\n-&gt; Thoughts are able to release chemichal reactions in our body. This is the sentence. If this was generally teached and repeated, how much better the world would be?\n\nAbsolutely!!!! I wish I learned that in school!!!!\n\nThought you were going to say cognitive behavioral therapy. At least as they brand CBT, it is talked about exactly as you described. (Really every type of psychotherapy could be viewed this way).\n\nSo anyway, I‚Äôm curious what books you‚Äôd recommend to learn more about this type of alchemy.¬†\n\nThis is my understanding of alchemy gained through reading a few books and a lot of research and meditation. I‚Äôve heard people talking about cbt never looked into it. I‚Äôm not surprised they teach a version of this somewhere to help people gain control. \n\nOne I highly recommend to get started is BECOMING SUPERNATURAL by Dr Joe Dispenza. Then I‚Äôd go for the Kabalion by Three initiates it is a summarised version of the kabalyion easy to get through amazing stuff really and of course the law of one. \n\nAlso check out the wanderers handbook if you‚Äôve got through these. You could get the wanderers handbook before the law of one. It quotes the law of one. I am reading that rn. I‚Äôm about to read meditations by Marcus Aurelius.\n\nThe only one I haven't read in your list is The Wanderer, (thanks for the suggestion‚ò∫Ô∏è), and I'm not done Meditations by Marcus Aurelius. \n\nAll of those books are game-changers and I also highly recommend them. When I discovered the Law Of One, I was completely blown away; it felt like it was something I knew but had forgotten. I had, and still have, many epiphanies with it. So beautiful!\n\nAaron Abke has a whole series of podcasts on the law on YouTube. Will explained\n\nYeah, he's really good at succinctly explaining the Law of One and boiling it down into palatable bite-sized pieces for most people to understand.\n\ni think the thoughts shared out loud in a therapy session are not the same as thoughts passing in the mind. our mind moves faster than we could ever talk and envisions things that we cannot describe perfectly with words. i think talk therapy is useful but in my opinion it does not compare with the self therapy of meditation. they are both useful tools, but i think their purpose and application is very different.\n\nWe interact with both/all types of thoughts and emotions in therapy. There are several techniques and worksheets to utilize automatic thoughts.¬†\n\nA thought log is one such way, which can be done on your own and specifically is about automatic thoughts in the internal monologue.¬†https://www.therapistaid.com/therapy-worksheet/thought-log\n\nYou are right there are thoughts and emotions that are not easily communicated through words. This actually why being with another person is so helpful with practices like therapy (you could extend this to a meditation teacher/yogi). Affect (the noun version of the word), moods, tone of voice, body language etc. can all be used to analyze patterns of thought, emotions, and behaviors that are unconscious. Auditory speech can reveal different patterns or different layers of intimacy than might be readily accessible in the internal monologue. This can be ‚Äúcaught‚Äù by the therapist and reflected.¬†\n\nUsing meditation in the session in one way to help someone interact, interpret, let go of etc. automatic thoughts.¬†\n\ninteresting to learn more about your practice\n\ni still think a thought log could never replace meditation, but it sounds like an interesting tool\n\nI've had the idea that when a thought shows up, it's a part of me trying to tell me something important. Like an Internal Family System Part trying to communicate with me.\n\nAbsolutely your inner voice can save your life! The question is which inner voice do you listen to? Some thoughts are just nonsense that you trauma bond to. \n\nOnce you allow a bad vibration all your thoughts will be in sync with that bad vibration. Like when you are angry so you think of other things that make you angry or when you‚Äôre sad so you think of other things that make you sad. \n\nYou have to express your duality too it is healthy to allow certain stressful and hard things into your realm of thought. But not when your just trying to enjoy a day that should be yours but you‚Äôre not in control so your at the mercy of your worst thoughts highjacking your nervous system. \n\nI was once there. I still have my moments I am not perfect but meditating is what got me here. \n\nI love talking about this stuff but nobody IRL has the head for it lol!\n\n\"I love talking about this stuff but nobody IRL has the head for it lol!\"\n\nWe're still in the dawning of the [age of aquarius.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjxSCAalsBE) (thank you 5th dimension).\n\nIsaac Newton predicted the age of aquarius would happen sometime after 2060.\n\n‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nWow this is a really helpful perspective.\n\nThank you. Look into the laws of the universe. The law of one or the Kabalion by three initiates on the 10 laws by Hermes. You are the universe in action. What you are looking for is looking for you. Our egos die. The conscious observer lives on.\n\nYour comments at the top are great, thank you! Then I saw you mentioning The Law of One and I was like \"yep, this person knows!\".\n\nHahaha I thought you were going the opposite direction on the law of one as soon as you said and then you mention the law of one! Thank you yo. We are all one!! The universe in motion.. Why? Idk.. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è lol\n\nI am actually guilty of not looking more into LoO!\n\nShould I ask if you are familiar with Gateway? I would automatically assume but asking just for the sake of it xD.\n\nI have had a few amazing experiences with psychedelics which has me interested in Astral Projection. I try to do it every night but can‚Äôt control it just yet. You recommend any books on how to do it?\n\nFirst of all, I have never had a single AP. That being said, I have saved a lot of resources on the matter and can recommended the following authors:\n\n- Robert Monroe - I've all 3 books and he's got some methods in his first one (though, he explains later those methods may not have been the best ones)\n\n- William Buhlman - Not a read a single book but I believe Adventures Beyond the Body is the most popular\n\n- Robert Bruce - I've read some people say his explanations and overall writings are overly complicated, but would recommend \"Astral Dynamics\" and \"Mastering Astral Projection: 90-day Guide to Out-of-Body Experience\"; He's got some books on astral self defence as well\n\n- Michael Raduga - He's someone who doesn't really believe in AP and puts (or used to) all altered states under the lucid dream term, but he has a 6-hour or so long YT video, which has helped some folks apparently, and also his techniques in his book \"The Phase\" work for a lot\n\n- Bruce Moen definitely should be mentioned, though I can't recommend any reads, so might just have a look yourself and pick something\n\n- Frank Kepple - Not sure if he is an author, per se, but has a great free resources website and is well regarded in the AP community: [https://www.astralpulse.com/frankkepple.html](https://www.astralpulse.com/frankkepple.html)\n\n  \nCovering all of those, if I go back to Robert Monroe, and also to my previous comment asking you about Gateway - well, he is the founder of The Monroe Institue and creator of The Gateway Experience, a series of guided meditations that use their patented Hemi-Sync technology. Gateway is supposed to improve your life in pretty much every aspect and help you discover who your really are, beyond the physical, and some people use it as an actual gateway to AP (alongside improving mental and physical wellbeing, manifesting; overall mental and spiritual growth, and other more niche practices like remote viewing). I think reading some of the above authors and trying out their methods, alongside getting on the Gateway journey is almost going to guarantee you, at one point or another, conscious AP experiences.  \n\n\nI would also recommend subbing to r/AstralProjection and r/gatewaytapes \n\n  \nThis post is pretty much about the resources I am aware of and that many people have used those to their own success. Obviously, the question is what will help you. In fact, I've probably only added more stuff to your plate, lol. But I hope I've also helped a bit!  \n\n\nPS: There is a separate Hemi-Sync series about AP, which I can send to you if interested.\n\nYep send me anything il check it out! Thank you for that info. I will check out these books. I have listened to the gateway tapes only once or twice but I want to experiment more with them. I need more info on it thanks. \n\nI have had a few crazy experiences waking up inside what most would call a dream. \n\nThe second time it happened to me I wasn‚Äôt ready for it at all. This was my most lucid experience in what I would call the Astral or a different dimension maybe both I don‚Äôt know.. \n\nMy friend and I took a very large dose of Lucy the psychedelic (don‚Äôt want to say the name on this sub) and my friend wanted to go out. I said no way I can‚Äôt go out. This was about 3 years ago. \n\nHe left me and went! It was his idea to do it then he left lol.. So I lay down on my bed and meditated waiting for it to affect me. \n\nMeditating was very new to me at this point and I didn‚Äôt really have a practice down. \n\nI fell asleep‚Ä¶ Next thing you know I am walking in this place with my friend beside me.. It was like the place they go to in the show the OA when they have OBE‚Äôs. I only recently saw this show a few weeks ago amazing show. \n\nMy heart started racing when I seen the place they go after they die in that show!! I was like that‚Äôs the place from my trippp!!! Really made me wonder. \n\nEverything was different!! Like the landscape was very cartoonish almost but not at the same time. I‚Äôm walking along looking at the sky and the grass that are hard to even explain how different they all were. Very vibrant. \n\nIt was surreal‚Ä¶.\n\nSo I am walking along with my mate and then I start to say bro this is not right!! I‚Äôm not supposed to be here!! My friend is like relax bro everything is good we will be alright and I‚Äôm like no bro I gotta go for real I can‚Äôt stay here!!! He says where you going to go??? \n\nI turn around and there is this big vortex full on swirling around like something out of stargate but swirlier‚Ä¶ lol.. \n\nSo I walk into it and my mate is shouting my name saying come back!!! \n\nI go into it! I remember seeing a man in robes and long hair with a big beard then next thing you know I‚Äôm back in the same place again just walking. \n\nThe whole scene plays out again I‚Äôm like bro I gotta go.. I was resisting the experience‚Ä¶ I jump back into this vortex‚Ä¶ \n\nBack there again walking!! I gotta stuck in this loop. It kept replaying over and over!! Next thing you know I go into it for the last time! \n\nI wake up on my bed!!! Heavy effects still from the psychedelic. \n\nIt was absolutely amazing.. when I got back to myself I was in a very trippy headspace. Everything was beautiful. I was having amazing thoughts and seeing visions in my mind. \n\nIt was magic. I literally was somewhere else! This was the time that made me really realise that we are multidimensional beings. \n\nI write down all of my dreams and this was not a dream. I was fully awake somewhere else!! \n\nI think it was some in between place or something. I will go back there and not be afraid. I really wasn‚Äôt ready. \n\nThe Buddha says that dreams are short and life is long but both the same thing. \n\nThe more you let go the more you gain peace..\n\nThis whole experience sounds like an amazing one. I would probably be freaking out, too, and not feeling ready. As much as I'd hate to admit it to myself, the only way to get the hang of those uncomfortable situations and experiences, be that in physical or any other life or state, is to experience more of them. Saying this as someone struggling with anxiety, who's done lengthy CBT, and have always fought back the therapist when they would push me towards it.\n\nYour story sounds a bit similarly to a story from the first Monroe book (in terms of having the sense of how real the experience is to waking life). Also, Neville Goddard has experienced other realities. Just mentioning those 2 as they are quite famous amongst the relevant cultures. On the other hand, you have the booming reality shifting or dimension jumping trend, but I personally associate it with stories from 15-year olds that claim to have gone to a Harry Potter universe or a Naruto one. It's another rabbit hole that is maybe worth exploring on its own. But to just expand a bit:\n\nThe simplest explanation of such phenomena (alongside even various OBEs) is that we are an awareness that can switch to different consciousnesses, all existing somewhere. Everything you can imagine already exists and some people have presumably learnt to tap into the potential of experiencing some of it. This is a very lose explanation obviously!\n\nGoing back to Gateway, I would like to invite you to the official Discord (of the sub, not Monroe's official Discord, lol!): [https://discord.gg/QvBtcaCY](https://discord.gg/QvBtcaCY)\n\nAs it's easier to talk and people there can help you with so much more than I do. I am just a newbie really! I collect sources and resources, but never fully research them - for whatever reason.\n\nIf you don't want to join a server, drop me a DM and I will fire up some links your way! I don't want to \"pollute\" this particular sub.\n\nInterestingly, I don't believe in free will so I don't think we have any ability to decide if our thoughts impact us or not.\n\nWould you tell me what led you to believe in predetermination? I can't see any true opposition to the idea of free will, but I would love to hear your thoughts.\n\nPredetermined or random doesn't change anything for me. I believe free will requires magic, because what can make a decision uninfluenced that is not random? And if such a thing exists, how does it even make a decision? Why choose anything if you will is truly free?\n\nI believe free will is the idea that needs proving more than the other way around, as it doesn't add up\n\nAny recs to read more about this? Anything you‚Äôve read specifically that led you here?\n\nKind of a weird one for me. I was never convinced of this position due to someone's philosophy or argument. Once the question was posed to me I was like how could we have free will, it's been my default kind of.\n\nI suppose Sam Harris tends to speak on the subject well towards how I believe it, and expands beyond that too. Robert Polesky (not sure I'm misspelling) talks about it too but I've never listened to him about this, I just see he's somewhat respected.\n\nI also think just looking into physics and science leads me here. Free will seems to be this one thing that if we have would just break the rest of the rules, and I don't really know where that could come from. There's a quote that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, and free will is an extraordinary claim to me.\n\nRobert Sapolsky ?\n\nIt feels like we have free will.\nI am in no camp, and I can't prove it myself.\nBut , \nsee this for example:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/PE0TedFPgH8?si=EAwinRIAesML2Bp-\n\nSeems that there is no free will, most other similar scientific experiments that are done all go into this direction.\n\nHaha yeah that's probably it. I should have googled the name, low effort on my part.\n\n&gt;It feels like we have free will\n\nI'd actually say it doesn't *have* to if you pay attention to the right things. To be honest I've spent most of my life feeling like my thoughts, actions and choices come out of their own accord. I don't even know how to explain how I think. So I think the lack of free will can be observed!\n\nI completely forgot about neuroscience though. There are experiments that show we know a decision has been made before consciousness has registered one, and I'm sure much else since. I think data there is certainly compelling.\n\nThat video is 55 mins long, and no offence to Tom but I'm not overly trusting in his choice of guests as always being unbiased so I'm not going to make time for that today. Can you summarise what in the video you think is relevant?\n\nI watched that video a long time ago, I would watch it again but no time right now.\nBut basically not just here in this video, we finnaly have equipment good enough and algorithms good enough that we can have experiments where by reading brainwaves it can be deducted what option a person will choose by their own free will. The catch is that algorithms and speed of equipment is enough today that computer can guess what you will choose split second BEFORE you are aware of your choice.\nSo it is like the choice is decided in brain hardware a moment before you are aware of that choice or you think you made that choice. So it seems there is no free will.\n\nI had a small experience when doing something that I am not doing it , that is is automatic and I just enjoy the benefits, there is much more to that experience and that short period of my life, but that is why I became interested in the stuff (meditation etc).\nBut event with that experience I didn't questioned free will or I felt that that is not my will, it was my will but it was just effortless, and a though came: \"vauu it feels like it is doing on its own\".\n\nNever got close to what happened to me naturally way before. Tryed yoga, various meditation etc, but never stuck to schedule or meditate every day, or keep same technique. Wish me luck.\n\nAh right yeah, we conducted those studies a while back now originally. I'm aware of them. \n\nBest of luck to you! Haha. You can always ask yourself where does your next thought come from? Try observe how you decide something, and you should notice you can't really tell. These things do just happen on their own. Even if you notice 'well I made that decision because I willed it' you can't then explain how you decided to will it. Will is either there or isn't in our experience, we don't have much say about that.\n\nHow does free will factor into the idea of thoughts impacting us, for you? I‚Äôm not seeing the connection. Free will can be an illusion and thoughts will still impact us. I agree it doesn‚Äôt exist, at least in the way people tend to explain what they think free will implies.¬†\n\nTo me, it depends on what you mean by ‚Äòthoughts‚Äô, ‚Äòimpact‚Äô and ‚Äòus‚Äô.¬†\n\nWell, many people say as the OC did things such as 'we are not our thoughts, we are the observer and we can decide how they affect us'. Through absence of free will, I simply stop at we are not our thoughts. If you are balanced in response to negative thoughts, that's not your choice. The feeling of making such a choice is either possible or not and doesn't depend on you willing it, same as the outcome of that action. Basically it's not your choice to react in a specific way, and it's more accurate to say that by repeated practice and effort towards equanimity we can become ever more capable of responding without reacting or being swayed by the influence of thoughts directly.\n\nOC says once you gain control... And I say that never can happen.\n\nI think we each have a different definitions of free will. Which is fine.¬†\n\nwhat do you think my definition is and what is yours?\n\nAlso, based on your first reply it perhaps seems you misunderstood me. I was never stating thoughts don't impact us, but that we can't decide if they do or don't.\n\nAh, I see. Yes, I think (some part of me thinks, at least) we are on the same page.¬†\n\nI completely believe in free will to be honest lol\n\nAre all thought suggestions? I.e. when I am deliberately thinking about something that would be me conjuring up thoughts right?\n\nI try this . When my intrusive thoughts about HOCD come to play , sometimes they affect me and make me down and out . Sometimes I feel a weird vibe through my body, which then makes me think I enjoy this. What‚Äôs your suggestion here¬†\n\nThe chemicals our emotions release become addictive. People become addicted to their own stress fear and overthinking. If you find it‚Äôs gone too far and you‚Äôre feeling bad and don‚Äôt want to feel how you feel try transmutation. \n\nPlenty about it look up the hermetic laws of the universe. The law of polarity. \n\nBasically everything has an opposite end of the spectrum. You can transmute to feeling the opposite end of the spectrum. Love and hate are on the opposite end of a spectrum to each other. Courage and fear are the opposite end of the spectrum to each other. \n\nIt works differently inside for everyone we all have our own metal ways of transmuting that works for us. \n\nThe way it works for me can be different depending on the situation‚Äôs severity. \n\nOnce you get your mind to switch vibration your thoughts will follow. Like I said above when we are vibrating happy we get happy suggestions (thoughts) when we are vibrating sad we get sad suggestions (thoughts). \n\nWe are the product of believing we are not in control. We can take control. This is what I believe being awake to be. \n\nSome people have no control what so ever. When they are angry the whole house has to feel it and it spreads to you if you are not in control enough to block there negative vibes. \n\nEmotions are also contagious I have found. I am getting a lot better with my psychic immune system lately as a perk of gaining control of my suggestion maschine (conscious mind).\n\nWhat are you going to think in one minute's time? We have no idea. Anything could pop into our heads. \n\nDid we choose the thought? No. Where did it come from? It just arose. Where did it come from? Causes and conditions. Synapses and electrical impuless. Life experiences, memories, other people in our lives, society, culture. Habits of thinking we've created in the past. \n\nTo echo what someone else said, Sogyal Rinpoche told the story of a student who was bugging this teacher, who was trying to enjoy a folk festival. \"How do I meditate?\" he would always ask, again and again. The teacher was kind of brusque with him. \"You know the gap after one thought ends and before the next one begins? Make it bigger.\"\n\nYou (or we, it's nondual) are the gap between thoughts. The awareness. Our practice is like looking for the blue sky in between the clouds, but eventually we'll become confident that the clouds don't hurt the sky. The sky is always there, even when there are clouds.\n\nDamn dawg. Thats a good explaination. Bless u.\n\nYour stomach makes stomach acids without asking, your lungs breath, your heart beats, your skin grows, your pancreas insulins(?).\n\n\nIt's the same with your brain, it thinks thoughts without you asking it to\n\nAbsolutely\n\nBeautiful\n\n1) \"What are you going to think in one minute's time? We have no idea. Anything could pop into our heads.\"\n\nThat's simply wrong. If you sit down long enough and have the patience to investigate about a thought's origins, you will find them. It's just that you don't want to set aside the time to do that either because the payoff is too small or because the thread you end up pulling is not something you want to deal with right in that moment.\n\n2) \"You (or we, it's nondual) are the gap between thoughts. The awareness. Our practice is like looking for the blue sky in between the clouds\"\n\nWhat sky? What clouds? I thought you said we're nondual. So how are there sky AND clouds?\n\nYou're trying to brush over something very difficult to explain in a nondual framework: illusion, Maya, whatever you want to call it. There are thousands of years and dozens of philosophical schools in Hinduism alone trying to figure out how on earth there are clouds when there should be only sky.\n\nthe sky is non dual because theres only one awareness i.e the sky.\n\nthere are clouds in the sky because you perceives in your awareness you experience it in the body and mind as thoughts, emotions and sensations.\n\nand i‚Äôm not too sure about finding the origin of thoughts, you might be confusing them with a set of beliefs. in which case it can be well worth investigating beliefs to learn more about yourself.\n\nCan you elaborate on your point, on why should there only be sky? Is it a metaphor, and all \"clouds/things\" are maya and misperceptions?\n\nThoughts come and go, they are constantly changing, impermanent. But that which perceives the thoughts remains unchanged.\n\nWhen I am not thinking, I still am. For example if I'm pushing cardio at high intensity, there will come a point where I am incapable of forming conscious thoughts, or if I'm in a flow state\n\nI don't think that it is so much that you are not your thoughts.  It's just that your thoughts are merely objects of perception.\n\nThe words you're reading on this screen are also objects of perception.  The laptop I'm typing this on is an object of perception.  The hum of the air conditioner I hear in the background as I type this is an object of perception.\n\nTo me, the question that seems important is: \"What is the justification for identifying ourselves with some objects of our perception moreso than others?\"\n\nOk, that's a question I can get behind.  I'll have to think on that one a bit first though.\n\nMaybe it's because I'm Buddhist, but man almost all these answers have been incomprehensible to me up until now.  Like people are answering a slightly different question than the one that was asked.\n\nWhat a great question! I think this leads one to think about what goodness and evil means and why we readily crave some states and shun others\n\nBecause through meditation, i have experienced a feeling that i can't describe. I guess peace/joy/grace comes closest. This connection to my higher self/universe tells me everything i need to know - without using any words. I'm def not my thoughts, and i realize my thoughts are conditioned based on past experiences. By letting go of those ties, you create a new reality for yourself. It's crazy, but true. Joe Dispenza talks alot about this, btw.\n\n‚ÄúThe universe tells me everything I need to know‚Äù \nSo right!\n\nYes. If you want to understand why you‚Äôre here, look at where you are.\n\nAbsolutely gs. My first spiritual book was by him suggested by a very good friend of mine I am very lucky to have. Get the book BECOMING SUPERNATURAL ppl by Joe Dispenza if you haven‚Äôt. It will really help you get going on this stuff. The world is yours.\n\nI‚Äôm on chapter 11!!\n\nBeautiful read. I got like 10 copies of this for Christmas and gifted it to everyone in my family. I thought if even one of them hears the message it be worth it.\n\nLove that! Exactly right, it‚Äôs a game changer.\n\nHow long do you meditate for to achieve thisv\n\nDon‚Äôt laugh, but pretty much off and on all day. Walking meditation, before bed and in morning, basically any free time I have.\n\nI wouldn‚Äôt laugh. I think that‚Äôs incredible that you do that. I‚Äôd like to try, I also meant how long would the meditations last and do you listen to something when you do them? Are they guided videos?\n\nI learned Eckart‚Äôs ‚Äúinner body energy‚Äú meditation, and that was a game changer. I basically allow myself to feel the universe through my body, and that‚Äôs what activates everything. That‚Äôs the only meditation I do it‚Äôs not guided and once you learn how to do it, you can do it anytime. I do it when I‚Äôm walking. I do it laying down. I do it driving sometimes.\n\nThanks. How did you learn it at first? Did you read one of his books or watch a YouTube video?\n\nI read The Power of Now, I think he explained it early on. Basically, you start with your hand‚Ä¶ You put your awareness on your hand you don‚Äôt think about your hand. You just put your awareness on it and wait to see what happens. Eventually, your hand will react either by feeling numb or tingling or a combination of both then you can do your other hand and your arm, and then eventually your whole body you were basically raising your vibrational level by doing this and putting your awareness on your physical body. It‚Äôs very peaceful and you can go very deeply into it.\n\nIs that like yoga nidra/body scan meditation?\n\nI‚Äôd love to know that too\n\ni'd also suggest, annapanasati, consciousness of breath. you can do this anytime also, because your breath is always with you.\n\nYour experience is premised on the fact that you have  already experienced the higher / no self - if I understand you correctly. Do you have a suggestion for people that haven't gone through that experience yet?\n\nYes, Tolle‚Äôs ‚Äòinner body awareness‚Äô is on YT. Learn and practice this, it‚Äôs actually pretty easy\n\nThanks for sharing. Seems similar to traditional vipassana\n\nYes the west continues to discover things the east has already known for a long time...\n\nThese techniques are spreading far and wide it seems, hopefully they continue to spread to the west north and south! As a westerner I am so grateful to have found them\n\ni know right ? i always feel so bad for all the people who struggles their entire lives only knowing Christianity. there are of course traditions within Christianity that support meditation and solitude etc. but it's very reserved for those who want to dedicate their lives to God completely. i could never understand reality through Christianity. i still don't understand it completely, but i understand it way better now with all of the different perspectives i have gained.\n\nI will check this out. Cheers\n\nDo you identify with the randomness of sounds, smells, sights, sensations and tastes? You taste spoiled milk, are you spoiled?\n\nWhy identify with thoughts when they are just as random and impermanent? \n\nLet them go\n\nThere‚Äôs something that is seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting and thinking. Find it and you‚Äôll have your answer\n\nI like to keep it simple. Thinking the thought 'I am a piece of cheese'. I am not. Helps me remember thoughts are not truth nor are they me.¬†\n\nOn a simple level I dont like being upset. If I could be happy in every situation i would.\n\nYour true nature is what you experience between thoughts.  Thoughts only cloud your view.\n\nWhen I hear a commentary on my own thought simultaneously with the thoughts... There thats an internal appraisal conference going on that I am over hearing\n\nThoughts are mercurial and unreliable. They can assail their host in the wrong conditions. What's the good of identifying with them? Also, identifying with thoughts makes it much harder to assess their accuracy and usefulness.\n\nIf you can observe it. Then it is not you.\n\nWhen \"you\" sit down to meditate, \"you\" have the intention to not have \"your\" attention be taken away from the meditation object (breath, sensations, mantra, whatever), yet \"your\" thoughts still arise and take away \"your\" focus.\n\nSo who is the \"you\" who is generating the thoughts that \"you\" don't want to be distracted by?\n\nThe only logical conclusion, from direct experience, is that at the deepest level of reality, none of these \"you\"s and \"your\"s were ever there at all in the first place.\n\nThis, good explanation\n\nWhat do you mean by never there at all?\n\nThe concept of ‚Äúyou‚Äù as a singular entity (which gets angry or sad because some external factors cause something ‚Äúyou‚Äù don‚Äôt want) is a fundamental illusion that the untrained human mind by default buys into.  This illusion causes much suffering and misery.  When you realize thoughts are no more ‚Äúyou‚Äù than any other sensation that appears in consciousness, like seeing a cloud in the sky or hearing a fart in the wind, the illusion shatters.  There is ultimately no one here to be mad or sad.  There are just processes and sensations, and either reaction or non-reaction to them.\n\nIt is hard to coherently explain in words because words are at best a signpost.  To really ‚Äúget it‚Äù, it has to be experienced directly.  Meditating deeply will help.\n\nLike i get intelectually that we're observing everything. But how can you not let the sensations get to you i.e. experiencing a severe mental or physical trauma?\n\nMeditating more.\n\nThe more you practice keeping your attention sharp (gently bringing it back to the meditation object every time it wanders, until the wandering gets shorter and shorter) and equanimity to sensations (i.e. you sit with strong determination to not move for an hour, even if you feel aches or itching or other discomfort) in formal meditation, the more it will transfer off the cushion to everything else you do in life.  The lessening of this concept of a self will happen naturally as you do this.\n\nIt might not happen overnight and it might not be easy, and you might not reduce your reaction to whatever trauma it is by 100%, but every little bit that you do manage to achieve will make your experience of life (and all the things that inevitably entails) better.\n\nThere was a Vietnamese monk, Thich Quang Duc, who set himself on fire to protest the government.  He sat perfectly calmly as he burned to death, while everyone else around him, who did NOT experience the intense direct physical pain that he did, was freaking out.\n\nI appreciate your response\n\nI want to understand, and ive been researching samadhi, but its still confusing because we're communicating to eachother now haha. I wanna know the source of the illusion too, and to experience directly what youre talking about. Thanks for responding!\n\nFor me, it has been experiencing a sense of oneness - those fleeting moments of pure connection to the world, to a kind of life force, an all-pervasive energy. When I‚Äôm in nature, for instance, lying down on cool grass and looking up at the sky, I have these moments where I‚Äôm just a part of life itself, there‚Äôs no thought or no separate being somehow. It‚Äôs like even physical boundaries aren‚Äôt there. Those fleeting moments truly make me believe I‚Äôm not my thoughts and I‚Äôm whatever does (or doesn‚Äôt) exist in these moments.\n\nI can disagree with my own thoughts. I can‚Äôt disagree with my underlying nature.\n\nThe most obvious is when I'm hungry but keep ignoring my impulses to eat. Some of the thoughts that ensue start to get absurd and ridiculous. No, I'm not going to die or pass out, lol. Nice try.\n\nDo you ever have a thought like I could just jump off the ledge right here. Or I could push this person right down these stairs? And you know you would never do such a thing. That little thought just passed on by but didn‚Äôt actually belong to you. I mean unless you actually acted on it.\n\nBecause I still am without them. Thoughs are a sort of internal commentary on experience, not the experience itself.\n\nIf I were my thoughts, I would not be able to observe myself having thoughts.\n\nSome people have no inner monologue.¬†\n\nI am disgusted by my intrusive thoughts\n\nI am my thoughts but I am not ONLY my thoughts. Thoughts come and go and nervous system adapts, sorts, enacts, stores, and discards. I am the assembly and distribution for the operation. As a metaphor, I am more the entire factory and not just the CEO. I have a board that determines how I will respond to each moment and influence. Conscious thought is there, unconscious thought is there but has to cooperate with body parts and organs. And we have emotions and the hormones that they ride in on. It‚Äôs all important. Thought does not exist without the rest of the organization; the rest of the organization expires eventually but conscious thought doesn‚Äôt have much to do with that.\n\nMy thoughts change. I don‚Äôt.\n\nI‚Äôve never murdered, hit or slapped someone. Yet I‚Äôve thought it. I‚Äôve also never kissed a beautiful woman on the lips because I‚Äôve been so instantly attracted to her. Yet I‚Äôve thought it.\n\nThink right now that you are a carrot ü•ï \n\n*are you a carrot?*\n\nSee.\n\nit is my awareness. the fact I am aware of the thoughts I am thinking.\n\nBecause you can observe them. Which positions you outside of them. Or at least, there is some part of you that is outside of them. A better way to put it is that you are not essentially your thoughts.\n\nThat you use a constuct such as \"evidence\" tells me you \n\ndon';t know what you are talking about. \n\nSpirituality, of which meditation can be a function, is Intuitive and \n\nNOT cognitive. Honestly, I wish you \"social media\" types would please \n\ngo away and leave people who have made meditation a productive part of their \n\nspiritual quest to confer.\n\n I mean you no evil. Just please use another venue.\n\nYou have good points, but thoughts are relevant to cognition. Clearly, evidence would be intuitive, but many who are in meditation or just starting out have not yet developed intuition. Many practices are rooted within the mind and don't transcend into the more intuitive perceptions. I think for many, this line of questioning is appropriate for meditation or spirituality as they have yet experienced the intuitive beyond the cognitive mind.\n\nPoint taken. Working to educate people about the difference between \n\ncognitions (Intellect) and suppositions (Intuition) is definitiely a \n\nnosebleed, especially in a dichotomy-based culture. Aphorisms\n\nsuch as \"The Spoken Tao is not the True Tao\" can only go so far\n\nas anyone who has wrestled with a Koan will tell you. \n\nThanks for the heads-up.\n\nI need to breath more.   üòÄ\n\nI get it. Too many are stuck in the mind, and the ego creates their reality. Yet they are sure they are awakened and realized. I struggle with that so much. It seems to be a mental concept and not true realization. I have learned how deceptive and tricky the ego is and know this is a potential problem to all seekers of the truth.\nBut as most seem to be stuck within the confines of the mind, it does not allow for expansion of the consciousness nor the development of intuition.\n\nFWIW I have found Fasting to be a great help in that regard. As most \n\nfolks know, Muslims have a strict Fast from Sunrise to Sunset during \n\nRamadam. I have made it a quirk of each day to strive to avoid \n\nsolid food and impulse eating during that time. It could be just an \n\nillusion of my own, but I like to think that such Fasting is a reminder\n\nto my Body from my Spirit what aspect of Self I would like to keep \n\n\"in charge\".  Just sayin.....\n\nThe third word in your subject body.\n\nYou are beyond your thoughts. You can choose your thoughts, observe them, and be thoughtless too.\n\nEver not have any thoughts and you're still you?\n\nI can repeat a thought as often as I want\n\nMy true self is my reaction to my thoughts. How do I reflect on my immediate reaction to something? \n\nThink of people with OCD. They may think something, and then be horrified by it. I view it like jumpscare.\n\nI am able to just observe my thoughts without judgement and know that I am not my thoughts.\n\nPeople around me\n\nWhat about the thought thinking the thought, and then the observer is the observed!\n\nI still am present and myself even when there are no thoughts. In deeper states of meditation,  there is an awareness even without thoughts.  If I were my thoughts, then I would not exist in the absence of thoughts.  Thoughts come and go, but I am still here.\n\nAll my thoughts are temporary. They seem to go away like a volatile gas. They ckme some other time or day but how can it be me if thoughts are permanent...\n\nWhen I try to concentrate I get distracted. I have emotions I don't want. I have impulses that are often not in my best interest. I have mental conflicts like craving food while wanting to lose weight. I can't see how thoughts, emotions and impulses arise into consciousness, they come from unconscious processes and just pop into awareness from who-knows-where. Even when I feel like I am using my mind to solve a problem, where did the impulse to solve the problem come from? \n\nThoughts, emotions, impulses are constantly arising and fading away. When I look closely I see that the stream of consciousness is actually just a sequence of cause and effect with one thought, emotion, impulse leading to another due to association, memory, or reason, without any entity controlling it.\n\nI think of my self differently when I am in different social roles (child, parent, sibling, employee, supervisor, sports fan, friend, nationality, ethnicity, religion, etc etc) I feel like a different person depending on if I am happy, sad, proud, ashamed, humble, arrogant. Existence is different depending on how I feel, hot, cold, pain, pleasure, hungry, thirsty, sated, sick, well, tired, energetic.  \n\n\n\nMy sense of self, the observer, the experiencer, the doer is no different than any other thought or feeling that comes into awareness and fades away. When I am fully involved in observing, when I am mindful in the present moment, I have no awareness of self at all.\n\nEvery one knows a lot of this already. It difficult part is accepting the implications.\n\nBuddha taught samatha and vipissana are two qualities of mind that should both be cultivated. They both help you to accept the implications to let go of attachments and aversions, including attachments to the self image.\n\nExperiencing them objectively.\n\nAny mental evidence could only be \n\nAn experiential realization.\n\nAlso seeing how the imagination is imaginary. What is real is what is in front of your face.thought labels we slap onto this reality are just stickers.\n\nthere is only two thoughts fear and love\n\nthe first i am not and the second i am that i am\n\nbest of all however, you get to choose\n\nI died.\n\nStillness\n\nWhen people I don't particularly care for like me. \n\nOne time, my boss told me I \"have a steady hand,\" although I feel like a nervous school girl often. \n\nPeople often perceive me as confident, although I'm just figuring shit out like everyone else. \n\nCute guys not knowing I think they're cute lol\n\nYou are not your thoughts? Thinking \"I am good at cooling\" does not make me good at cooling if I'm not good at cooking. Do you perhaps mean you are not the thinker of your thoughts? If I was the thinker of my thoughts I could make thoughts stop, no?\n\nThat they bother me. Who is the me who gets bothered?\n\nThere is a reason why we say \"my thoughts\", or \"my emotions, or \" my body\". As if your body, thoughts, and emotions, are things that you have in your possession but aren't you.\n\nLet's turn this around:\n\nWhat's the best evidence that I am my thoughts?\n\nGenerally any kind of evidence the mind can bring for or against is gonna be formulated by thoughts \n\nTetralemma from Indian logic is useful for this kind of investigation. \nAm I my thoughts?\nAm I not?\nBoth? \nNeither of this? \nOther option? \n\nIn madhymaka You do this until your mind cannot come into any definite conclusion regarding the nature of mind. You then rest present, free and open without any assumptions and conclusions in direct nakedness\n\nAnything you can witness can not be you\n\nThey disappear.\n\nSimply my behavior and actions. While my actions and behaviors are influenced by my thoughts, emotions, and environment, they are critical to who I am.  Without my behaviors and actions, I am not complete as a person seeking enlightenment.\n\nThe fact that thoughts come and go, yet awareness of them does not\n\nDo you need evidence? This is something you can experience by sitting down quietly for a few minutes.\n\nRomina Avila ‚Äî '*Our thoughts are just*¬†a story our mind tell us.'\n\nOne day, during chanting of my mantra of loving kindness, I just zoomed out and became the witness of my thoughts. I could see very clearly that I am not my thoughts. The evidence was my **conscious** experience.\n\nI attended my first sound bath. It was awesome, except for a few minutes. Negative thinking started with no prompting from me at all, like this dark self conscious feeling; just give up, leave, this isn‚Äôt YOU. WTF!!\n\nIt was confusing, unwanted, dark. It was my ego fighting to survive. I can recognize this. Had I left some important things will fail to manifest. Now I wait, many positive events with more to come!\n\nI am not this body.\n\nMy body falling apart and aching.\n\nThe problem is you ARE a collection thoughts feelings and emotions. That's what makes you alive and what makes you human. Emotions like love , hate ,fear, joy, sadness, pain, and the list can go on and on and are required. There is no escaping that fact. There is no denial that our brain on a neurological level releses neurotransmitters into the synapses of our millions of neurons every second of every minute. So, saying that you need to eliminate your emotions is foolishness, Controlling our reactions to those emotions is something different entirely. And those lies the tricky part dealing with the negative emotions while retaining the positive emotions. The only way to do that is to spend time on yourself and in your our mind. Processes like meditation, yoga, healthy diet, and physical activities and academic research will aid you during this process but ultimately you will need to find your own way with the tools that have been provided to you there is no guidance for this journey just you and toolbox.\n\nI feel them, or know them, as being not my.own, they are my parent's, some person I met, kids at school, my grandmother... I'm simplifying it, but I mean, they're just voices I heard made thoughts I see with my other me. I have let them pass by and not engage. If I am able to not engage, they are not me in some sense.\nSounds crazy.\n\nPersonally I've developed a view that I (and any other human) have 3 parts to them -- reason, emotions and will.\n\nReason is your thoughts. They are your super ego, if you will. They reason about the world around you and inside you, trying to fit everything together into a coherent picture which isn't necessarily the truth, it's just a perspective on things bound by logic and relationships between facts. Reason is basically the lines of the drawing that yet to be coloured.\n\nEmotion is your feelings. They are akin to pain and pleasure, yet they tell you about your internal state rather than external. They usually aren't bound by reason and are a primary base response to everything what happens with you. They are like id, akin to colour to your painting, making it either bright or grim depending on your circumstances. They usually mix with reason to feed you the whole picture.\n\nWill is your actions. This is probably the only part about you that is truly you, because despite all the reasons and emotions, will is the one to decide what to do with them. You can accept them, deny them, ignore or do anything else. If we're taling about paintings, it's the painter themselves. They decide what goes and what not goes into the picture and whether they should redraw it alltogether if that's what's needed. This is your ego and it's the most fleeting part that humans have. It's our subjectivity, our point of view without any reason or emotions bound to it.\n\nTherefore, if my emotions and reason are external to me and are just instruments of perception, I'm not them, I'm the one that percieves. Hope this helps.\n\n\"Why are you talking to yourself?\"¬†\nüò≥¬†\n\nBecause they vary so wildly.  Sometimes I just consider a thought that's entered my head &amp; see how irrational or unjustified or hypocritical or whatever it is.\n\nSubject / object relationship. I ‚Äúsubject‚Äù can observe and interact with the ‚Äúobject‚Äù that is my thoughts. There for I cannot be my thoughts.\n\nDirect realization. Once you see it you can‚Äôt unsee it. It‚Äôs no longer even a possibility. It‚Äôs been taken off the table.\n\nWhen I ask myself \"what is that which knows the thought?\" and not let another thought answer this question, and in doing so become aware of awareness, that is solid evidence\n\n‚ÄúI am not my thoughts, I am the thinker of my thoughts.‚Äù - words from my therapist that I often repeat to myself.\n\nBecause a thought has no consciousness. It‚Äôs just a thought. Thoughts don‚Äôt know anything just like sounds don‚Äôt know anything. Sensations are not aware.\n\nI'll have conversations with myself.\n\nI have no good answer. WTF am I?ü§£\n\nThe concept of ‚Äúyou‚Äù is a spectrum of differentiating yourself from your environment. Your thoughts, especially those you don‚Äôt act on, are the smallest parts of ‚Äúyou‚Äù that can possibly exist, since ‚Äúyou‚Äù only exist in comparison to things that are not you, which are externally existing things. Your thoughts are internal, the most internal that the concept of ‚Äúyou‚Äù can possibly be. \n\nThinking about this reminds me of the concept of infinitesimally small stuff. The universe is infinitely large and expanding, in theory. So if you take a thought, the absolute smallest quantity of yourself that can exist and just call it‚Äôs existence a fixed whole, it‚Äôs kind of like comparing any fixed quantity to the ever-expanding universe. 1/‚àû is basically zero. If you graphed this, the result would be so, so, so small, it is basically zero. 1 billion divided by infinity is also basically zero, but still a little larger than 1 / infinity. \n\nSince ‚Äúyou‚Äù exist in the differentiation of yourself to your environment, that which is most you is that which is external. Your thoughts drive your behavior, this is true, but ‚Äúyou‚Äù are not your worst parts, the parts you chose to let go. You is better understood as your interactions with your environment that differentiates yourself from it imo.\n\nLove this question. The direct experience of the oneness consciousness and how tiny (like a grain of sand in the desert) our temporarily human experience is\n\nI‚Äôm aware that I‚Äôm thinking\n\nYour current ego is nothing but thoughts.\n\nSitting there playing a video game and there is a nagging voice in my head screaming to stop playing and do something else, and it gets ignored. That 100%.\n\nHaving said that, no I don‚Äôt have a problem anymore. That‚Äôs a symptom from last year and I found better self control. Still though it is evidence for me that the thoughts are not the whole me.\n\nThat I can listen to them as if I am listening to a radio or as if I am listening to someone else and witness them come and go as if I am looking out into the ocean and seeing the waves arise and fall.\n\nIt's because the body/mind/thoughts are there for a lot of the time, whereas the laptop/dinner/job isn't. It's difficult not to identify with all this because you can't 'see' awareness, you can only know of its existence because it's impossible to deny. John Wheeler had a good pointer that goes something like, 'denial of the false is not the same as affirmation of the true' - only when you let go of everything and find you still are, then you'll know what you really are.\n\nCuriosity and wonder/awe at certain things\n\nI can‚Äôt quiet my mind so‚Ä¶\n\nI‚Äôm not in prison\n\nOne thing that stuck with me and I‚Äôm not sure where I read it or heard it.  \n\nImagination.  We can force specific thoughts,  and very elaborate ones as well.   We can sit and close our eyes and imagine almost anything we want. \n\n‚ÄúI‚Äù can control thought.  I can create them or ignore them at my pleasure.  If my thoughts are under my control when I choose,  then it‚Äôs logical to deduce that the I is the creator of thought not the thought itself.\n\nwatch ASCENDOR on youtube young guy who explains itreally well  and other concepts\n\nMy thoughts are the result of experience based within a material dimension in which a biological entity is bound. I am not this entity, this entity is a collection of light particles that accumulated from other energies. It is literally a space suit emanating from consciousness.\n\nI can exist for somewhat long periods of time in silent meditation without thinking or moving. Still as a statue, breaths slow down to a few per minute.\n\nI can act without ever need of ratiocination anymore which makes me act without any thoughts whatsoever on my mind . I don't have any random stream of thoughts anymore . I did meditate a bit before getting rid off my random thoughts. At least that's one of the best evidence personally I have that I'm not my thoughts.\n\nAlan Watts told a story of a Zen master who asked his student, do you sweat because you are hot? Or are you hot because you are sweating?\nI thought that was a stupid observation at first. But I came to understand his point. The thoughts are the thinking. There is no center.\n\nLogic. I'm a person, not a thought. I do believe that I (meaning both the conscious and the unconscious mind) am the creator of my thoughts."

    "all_comment_text": "Insight Timer has lots of free ones. Tara Brach‚Äôs are nice.\n\nI've been seeing insight suggest a lot, makes me think it must be good.\n\nI use insight timer for the meditation timer itself, I didn't really like any of the guided ones I tried on it.  A few of the teachers gave off a bit of a \"I believe crystals have magic energy contained within them\" type vibe. \n\nFor guided meditations, I much preferred healthy minds program.  It has both sitting and \"active\" meditations - where you practice mindfulness while engaged in a task.  This is the sort of everyday mindfulness that most people are seeking to cultivate through meditation.  I like the guys voice, and it's backed by Richard Davidson who is a prominent mindfulness researcher. There's tonnes of different types of meditations to choose from too. Hands down the best free app I've tried (and I've tried a lot).\n\nSome of the most well known and best respected meditation instructors in the world are on insight timer so you likely just picked some bad ones.\n\nSecond the Healthy Minds app \n\nThere are some good guided ones on Insight Timer\n\nI'm pretty anti-woo and I never got that impression from the guided meditations I've used on there, but I definitely didn't vibe with most of them. IMO Insight timer's best use is for non-guided meditation, since the customization options are really good.\n\n&gt; \"I believe crystals have magic energy contained within them\" type vibe.\n\nThere's definitely a range of teachers there, including some who from other apps (I'm thinking of Joseph Goldstein who I like, mainly because I started on TenPercentHappier, and he's the main teacher on the initial lessons there.)\n\nThey literally have hundreds of teachers on Insight, if you don't like that sort you just need to search around for people of the sort you do like. I was surprised to find they had talks from almost all of my favorite teachers that I'd been exposed to through other avenues.\n\nTheir daily quotes are nice to read, and it's a simple enough app to create your own meditation timers. I use it sometimes as a nap timer\n\nThanks for the nap idea lol! So smart\n\nI was going to recommend Insight Timer which has lots free. I also loved Calm but it‚Äôs kind of pricey.\n\nBeen using it (insight) for years and worth the paid version, but lately I've also paired it with 10% happier and use both.  I find the QC / production value maybe a little better in 10%, as well as general onboarding and structure for someone new to things.  But insight has more content, you just have to weed through more bad/mediocre stuff to find the good stuff and be more self directed.\n\n10%Happier is good - I liked their short courses back when I paid for it, and the on-boarding tutorial is good.  You can use the free version forever, and there's a small number of free guided meditations available, and the timer.\n\nInsight Timer for the Win!! I love that app.\n\nI've used both, headspace and insight timer.. \n\nInsight timer: much better UI, more teachers, most of the things are absoluetly free.\n\nHeadspace: more vipassana meditation, better advice and guidance (if you know how to search and assess them)\n\nI've tried a few of them and insight timer is my clear favourite because it has a decent UI, it's focused on meditations and music (all I need it for) and most importantly I can search by length because my daily meditation time isn't consistent - sometimes I've got an hour, other times I just need ten minutes in the car.\n\nI've used Insight Timer for years. It's amazing, and free.  Although you can pay to have access to more, I  never have. It's a great app.\n\nI really like Medito.\n\nSeconding Medito, I started using it years ago and it's been very solid the whole time.\n\nNever heard of it, I'll have to look it up. Thank you\n\nSame\n\nWaking Up is the only app I like anymore, after having tried both Insight Timer and HeadSpace.\n\nThe quality of the content in Waking Up is second to none. The talks, the lessons, the meditations. Honestly it's the best investment i've made in YEARS.\n\nI agree, and if you look on the subscription page there‚Äôs an option to contact them and get the app for free if you can‚Äôt afford it\n\nYep. I remember Sam Harris saying the whole philosophy behind the app was that he didn't want it to become some silicon valley funded subscription service that tries to squeeze every penny out of its users, and that he's happy to make way less money on it than he potentially could.\n\nCame here to also recommend Waking Up. I absolutely LOVE it. 30 day trial, and if the price looks unreasonable you can go on to their website and request for a 50% off membership. They want to make it accessible, not get rich off of it. \n\nSam Harris has a wonderful introduction to meditation. Packed full with insightful (and short, as in approachable) lessons that teach you WHY you‚Äôre being guided to do those particular breathing patterns, visualization, etc. \n\nIt‚Äôs basically: 10 minute meditation, 5-10 minute lesson as to what he just lead you through and why. \n\nAt the conclusion of the 30 day intro sessions you then can venture into other people‚Äôs similarly structured guided sessions with accompanying philosophy/lessons. \n\nHighly recommend!\n\nAfter trying and failing to learn to meditate and stick to the habit using headspace and insight timer. Waking up and atomic habits combo did the trick for me. I have now been meditating for 7 months everyday like a clockwork.\n\nBalance has been my preferred one. They offer a year long trial, so plenty of time to learn everything you need to know and get the habit started. Then it's totally up to you if you want to continue using it or not.\n\nSecond Balance.\n\nYea I like balance. Glad they gave the free membership, thinking about buying the lifetime one\n\nSounds good. After being burnt by headspace I'll be sure to study their policy before entering a free trial ü•≤\n\nJust curious, do you guys repeat the episodes from the advanced plans? The episodes which you found more interesting and helpful. Or do you keep moving forward ?\n\nI've been moving forward, but there's a few I plan to revisit once I've finished them all once through. Finishing up the last advanced plan soon.\n\nThat‚Äôs great. I joined balance recently and it has been helping me hone my skills really well. However, since we only get one episode to practice each skill (with a bit of modified episodes here and there) I need more time to really settle with each meditation skill to implement them well is my idea. To build a strong foundation. I finished one plan and I‚Äôm on my second but I wasn‚Äôt sure if that‚Äôs the right way to do it üòÇ\n\nBalance app over Headspace, betterMe and any other app that I have tried and I can't remember at this point.\n\nBalance app wins, 100%. It's well written and well delivered\n\nPlum Village Is the Best for me, completley free, with different type of meditations, timer, how toos, and there's also some silent meditations that can gradually help you get confortable with non guided meditations, good luck.\n\nThings must‚Äôve changed over the years. I started with meditation using Headspace before transitioning to TM. My Headspace account auto-renewed and they gave me a refund. This was 3 years ago, so it is possible policy has changed. Overall, Headspace was a good way for me to get started with meditation.\n\nYeah original Headspace was where I started out too. Was great to learn techniques and nudged you into having more silence for your own practice. \n\nI must‚Äôve used it like 6/7 years back though.\n\nWhat‚Äôs TM?\n\nTranscendental meditation\n\nI was looking into this type could you share some insight into the differences?\n\nIts bullshit.\n\nIs it like cult scam level BS?\n\nYou pay good money for TM to give a super secret password mantra or some such thing.\n\nI was looking into this type could you share some insight into the differences?\n\nDidn't¬†know¬†much when you asked but¬†just¬†recently¬†started practicing it. It's really simple, you just repeat a mantra in your head silently for 20 minutes. But apparently you need to go to an instructor first to get a mantra, but these can cost hundreds of dollars. I'll probably do that eventually but for now I just repeat Om or So hum.¬†\n\nI've been seeing in recent reviews that they sold the company and things have changed for the worst.... They say. I just had a really bad experience.\n\n&gt; Headspace was founded in May 2010, by Andy Puddicombe and Richard Pierson. Puddicombe is a former Buddhist monk. In 2004, he returned to the UK \"to make meditation accessible, relevant, and beneficial to as many people as possible\". Pierson had a background in marketing and brand development.\n&gt; \n&gt; Headspace began as an event company, holding mindfulness talks in and around London. In 2012, Puddicombe and Pierson developed and launched the first version of the Headspace app.\n&gt; \n&gt; In August 2021, Headspace merged with online mental health platform Ginger in a deal valuing the combined company at $3 billion.\n&gt; \n&gt; In May 2022, Puddicombe announced on Twitter and Instagram that he and Pierson had left the Board, ending their engagement with the company, though Puddicombe's historical content remained on the platform.\n\nEdit: I think Business Schools don‚Äôt teach people how to create value, they just teach people how to monetize and wring out the juice of it wherever they see it.\n\nSad news to hear :( Headspace helped me manage my anxiety and get foundational stuff going that I still practice until now even when I don't have the app. I started 7 years ago. Left the app last year because of app developments &amp; features that didn't apply to what i needed at the moment.\n\nA meditation company to me is just weird all around. Monasteries and temples will teach you for free. Heck you can go to a 10 day vipassana retreat anywhere around the world and ask questions to a master if you have them. Live like a monk basically for 10 days. All donation based, they ask just give what you can or feel like it was worth or even better‚Äîcome back and serve one.\n\nEasy access. Not everyone are in locations to take advantage of some of the things you mention. Or they wouldn‚Äôt necessarily know where to start. An app just makes it more accessible and easier to get started.\n\nInsight Timer here, too\n\nI liked 10% Happier when I wanted to play with guided, and My Timer is unobtrusive and simple for quiet sits.\n\nI love the Calm app but you don‚Äôt need an app. I use the calm app for many reasons, love the bedtime stories, calming music and the selection of guided - or unguided - meditations is really solid.\n\nYes I can relate with head space‚Ä¶, be aware. Without my permission they took out about $70! out my account! I wasn‚Äôt even subscribed I had cancelled it months ago so I went mad at them! \nThey refunded me and apologised!\n\nI'm happy that worked out for you ! Yea they have really shady business practices it's seems\n\nThe Plum Village app is all I need personally\n\nI'm a teacher on Insight Timer. Been there for ten years or more. The free version has lots of guided meditations. If you pay for it, you also get talks, livestreams, courses, etc. Their policy for accepting teachers is pretty inclusive, so you do get a fair amount of nonsense. But look for the legit stuff. Also, learn to meditate! You don't need someone taliking in your ear all the time (even me.) \n\nAnyway, look for credentialed teachers. If you get something good from one, I encourage you to donate to them. I didn‚Äôt join to make money. I downloaded it just for the timer. But when some of the members of my Buddhist community asked me to record some meditation instructions, I applied to be a teacher and uploaded them there. I have put up some premium content since then, and I think I've made $250 or so in ten years there. So I don't think anyone is getting rich doing it, but the economic setup probably favors those whose teachings appeal to the most people... thus some of the spiritual woowoo. \n\nDon't let that keep you from trying it, though. Just start with the freebie and see how it goes.\n\nVery sound endorsement. It has been the most popular suggestion so I'm definitely going to check it out\n\nInsight timer. There's so much you get even with the free version that it's worth it right there. I do pay for it and it's never been a problem for me.\n\nPlain old youtube is also great.\n\nI search for guided meditations, and the general thing I want to experience and then find one that fits with the time I have available.\n\nThe best Youtube Meditation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e59guruVL4o\n\n(/s)\n\nInsight Timer, Brightmind, Equa. Also I‚Äôve never used it but people rave about Sam Harris‚Äôs Waking Up app.\n\nI‚Äôm getting a lot of benefits from Waking Up, and went from using guided meditations to now using a pretty significant mix of silent ones. The theory content has helped me quite a bit as well.\n\nWaking up is awesome. It‚Äôs a great balance of guided meditations with a TON of lectures/essays/podcasts.\n\nI initially used headspace when it was mainly Andy, but I think the company either merged or was bought.  I still use some series from Andy and some of the music.\n\nTry wakingup if you want to look at the looker, or fart at the farter.\n\nI've never been more confused and amused\n\nI'm not too fond of guided meditation apps in general, as they're either completely watered down to appeal to secular sensibilities, or completely woo-woo. Waking Up was the only app which went into metaphysicsal aspect of meditation. If you actually want to reach the profundity of meditative practices, check out Waking Up.\n\nü§£üòÇ\n\nUsing Idanim. The app is completely free and has pretty good meditations\n\nOooh, definitely going to look into that thanks\n\nHealthyMinds app. It's 100% free and includes many meditation programs for different needs. It was founded by Richard Davidson, one of the world's leading contemplative neuroscience researchers.\n\nSurprised there aren‚Äôt more notes for this one. \n\nHealthy Minds is also a nonprofit. Great one too support.\n\nI use Oak. Minimalist, does the job, and is free.\n\nFree sounds good ü•≤\n\nI've started using medito which is a crowd sourced app that's completely free - I really like it\n\nWhy do you think you need an app for meditation? Say NO to meditation apps and leave your smartphone behind! üòä\n\nI prefer guided meditations üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\n\nThere‚Äôs plenty of free and/or non-predatory apps that can be helpful to beginners\n\nDo you have a couple favorites?\n\nOak\n\nI like the bros voice\n\nSolid point actually! Guess it can feel like a bit of hand holding to start\n\nI can understand the hand holding part. I use YouTube a lot when I've to do something that's either tedious or generally difficult for me. I type \" .... with me\" like study with me or work with me and there are youtubers who live stream work or study sessions and you can just join! Makes you feel less lonely in your task. I did some YouTube search. Couldn't find any live \"meditate with me\" kind of videos but there are some real people meditation recordings that comes with the same keyword search, those are always more helpful than animation ones or the ones that just have sound. Hope that helps!\n\nNo yea, thank you for sharing that. It can be a bit lonely.\n\nInsight timer is free but even their subscription is worth it. Tons of teachers/ styles and bells.\n\nI recommend the Calm app it has so many great teachers with all levels of meditation\n\nInsight Timer is the best!\n\nI cannot believe Oak is not high up in the comments.\n\nLool I've seen a few people recommend it , definately on the list of apps to check out.\n\nSo many free ones on youtube etc...don't pay!!!!\n\nI've been using Insight Timer for years, as others have said, it's a great app.  \nI have a vast collection of guided meditations for every occasion :-D\n\n100% I was charged for months and kept complaining. They have additional hidden costs also. SAY NO TO HEADSPACE\n\nThat's crazy!  I can't foresee things ending well if this is common placed.\n\nYou can get the Sam Harris app for free if you email them and tell them you‚Äôre on a budget\n\nIm using calm app and I have free premium pass c/onof my company. I like ybe ui and the collei. Anyone message me if you want a premium pass (free)\n\nMessaged you! Thanks so much\n\nI always thought that Headspace was kinda unethical. Bro spent some years with Buddhist monks and straight up turned their teachings into his own profit. Wtf.\n\nBefore the internet people were able to learn without any apps at all. Books that explained it were enough to tell people what to do. Then practice did the rest. The late Dr Ainslie Meares wrote many books and a couple explain how to meditate. One of them was an international best seller translated into many languages and it is included in the book \"Ainslie Meares on Meditation\".\n\nWaking Up app is my fav.\n\nI use the meditation app that comes with down dog. So yoga and Meditation for the price of one. I likenthat I get a little pep talk everyday and then 10 minutes of silence\n\nOh that sounds like a really good combination actually\n\nYes! And they're generated so it's a new practice every day\n\nExpand is the only meditation app that I use now\n\nOh how do you find it?\n\nApple Store\n\nMedito\n\nWaking up app is great. I have tried them all.\n\nI like balance. A year free and then less than $200 for a lifetime.\n\nMedito.\n\n1 giant mind. Free and simple\n\nWaking up is excellent, and can be gotten free if you cannot afford a subscription.\n\nThe Plum Village app is free and has guided meditations, a mindfulness bell, timers, talks, readings, videos, etc.\n\nInsight Timer. Check out David Gs meditations.\n\nTry out The Way. It‚Äôs a new app created by a Zen master named Harry Shukman. I completed his series on Koans that he did for the Waking Up app. I really love how it‚Äôs structured and his voice is absurdly calming. There is a generous trial and like Waking Up, it offers scholarships if you‚Äôre unable to pay for the membership.\n\nI've tried headspace before, but there wasn't a lot available unless u paid for it.\n\nI adore Plum Village. Totally free!\n\nI just do Spotify guided meditation playlist.\n\nMedito. Totally free, but you can donate.\n\nWhy do you need an app for meditation? For me just a simple timer works.\n\nThe Waking Up app by Sam Harris is the best! \n\nIf you really want to understand the reality of your mind / consciousness, I haven‚Äôt found anything better. stick with it and it will change your life. \n\nAlso the Plum Village app is another amazing resource. I‚Äôll use that and insight timer for my evening sits \n\nMay you be well üôèüèº‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nMedito is completely free and I find it very good, and Balance offers a free year of their app. Both are well worth a go!\n\nTry the medito app or the idanim app both are free.\n\nI really like this app. I‚Äôve been using it for a half a year and the meditations are perfect for my busy life. I used to use headspace but also found it was overhyped. https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/ponder-ai-powered-meditation/id6471901420\n\nMedito takes the W\n\nThe mindful movement on YouTube has a ton of free guided meditations of varying lengths. I use them instead of headspace\n\ninsight timer!!\n\nI just use YouTube for my meditations. So many options\n\nCan't you dispute it on the app store/google play?\n\nI'm trying\n\nLots of great meditations on YouTube. I recently started a channel sharing 3-minute guided practices!\n\nRIP Maloka\n\n[I like this one](https://lumenategrowth.com/)\n\nSmiling Mind is a great free app. Lot's of features and programs.\n\nim happy with calm app it keeps me on track\n\nUnwinding anxiety\n\nMany years ago, Headspace started me on my meditation journey. It was a great introduction but I grew out of it a few years in. Since I‚Äôve been using Waking Up from Sam Harris. Not cheap but they do offer free memberships for those that can‚Äôt afford it\n\nI really like Smiling Mind :) it‚Äôs completely free and it starts with small increments and builds the habit from there.\n\nI always recommend healthy minds Innovations. Mindshift CBT is another\n\nAll you need is a timer.\n\nMy company pays for free Headspace for all employees. Maybe this is their new business model: get corporate HR depts to buy it.\n\nInsight Timer is decent.  Waking Up is really superior, but could be more for advanced meditators.\n\nI have tried headspace, calm but like Balance the most. It's very simple,  elegant but intuitive. I like their guided meditation as it's to the point.\n\nWaking up app all the way.\n\nThey provide a free access for 6 months too.\n\ni transitioned to youtube videos and no audio, headspace is a good stepping stone though\n\nI used Balance, it is paid for but you get to try it on a trial for a year, really helped me start. Not that I meditate much these days, I need to get back into it. üòÇ\n\nI'm really liking Insight Timer. They have talks by all my favorite monks and lots of control flexibility if you want to set a timer for some kind of \"complicated\" meditation.\n\nInsight timer\n\n1giantmind is free. It's very simple, and very effective. Speaking anecdotally here but I've learned far more about meditation from this very simple app than any other app I've ever used.¬†\n\nI also find Declutter The Mind very good. Though you can get a subscription, there are loads of free meditation guide videos on YouTube, and also on the Declutter The Mind website.¬†\n\nBalance has a 1 year full subscription for free at the moment. That's also a good app. Breaks meditation down with lots of different grounding, visualisation and breathing techniques. I think this is a good for absolute beginners to meditation who need a lot of guidance to start out.¬†\n\nhttps://youtu.be/SmO6GDb0aE8?si=VcitM4_Kwh_bxPk-\nTry this.\nIt's simply fantastic.\n\n&amp; all other by the same master.He'll take you home,I can assure.\n\nThanks for sharing that üòÅ\n\nYou canceled within the advertised trial period or after it ended?\n\nInterval timer is a good basic gong timer, you can set different durations. I have it for like 3 min breathing, 3 min listening, 5 min body scan, 10 min meditation\n\nI go back and forth between guided and non guided meditation.\n\nLately tho I set it to 20 min, then do a guided meditation in balance app which is 10 min long, then do unguided for another 10 min when balance finishes\n\nWaking Up app. \nInsight Timer.\n\nMeditation apps are merely a crutch. You should learn how to meditate and just go meditate. In other words, find a teacher. Learn a technique. Then practice it for a while üëç\n\nGrew up in an ashram over here. Permanently allergic to the word *should*.\n\nI have been using Balance every day for seven months and have been impressed with it.\n\nBalance is quite a good App for meditation.\n\nSmiling mind is the best !!!!!\n\nYou were charged after cancellation :o? I used headspace on and off, cancelling it few times, but it never happened to me. If they charged you after cancelling, please report it, did you write to them?\n\nWhatever happened to just setting a timer and mediating?\n\nBoho Beautiful\n\nI personally love YouTube and have many meditations for different purposes, with binaural beats and frequencies. No app needed, just a nice play list that covers the bases.\n\nI do like headspace just because it keeps me accountable and I am new to meditation. However I'll check out all the other suggestions that people had! I can imagine they're much better, and that's super exciting:) \n\nI canceled my subscription once but it didn't really cancel so I had to cancel it from the Google app store.\n\nI don't know how much the subscription is in the US, but for me it's around 4-5USD per month.\n\nThe thing which is inside us we are feeling needs An App now,like  Buddhists were trying to  remove Attachments and here we are using Apps for thee things we have to do  Deep down process inside us\n\nThe problem is there isn't even Yogguru,all are free  from the world lying somewhere we have to find, maybe here,maybe on Other Town,Other State ,Other Country many countries apart in Some Simplistic rural area near A river or near A Shivling\n\nI‚Äôve used Balance and found it simple, user friendly and extremely helpful. Now, the yearly subscription is a bit out of reach for me for exchange rate reasons. But aside from that, I highly recommend it.\n\nTen Percent\n\n'Waking Up' works for me. Great app\n\nHave done tons of trials with them and never had an issue like this. Though it is always a risk with any developer. That‚Äôs why I sometimes will subscribe through an App Store because cancellation is easier to do and track. I like Headspace for the meditations and sleep stories. Calm has some good sleep stories as well. Though I‚Äôve never delved deep into Calm‚Äôs meditation library.\n\nI saw some comments suggesting HealthyMinds, Medito, Oak and I‚Äôll also suggest Tide and Stoa because I didn‚Äôt see anyone else mention those. \nI actually came to Medito first and completed their beginner course over a few months. I knew I liked the practice of meditation and wanted to continue, so that‚Äôs when I came to these other apps. Medito is 100% free and ad-free, with the option of donation.\nNext I tried HealthyMinds, which I loved because between meditation practices it includes educational clips about what‚Äôs happening in your brain and what meditation is really doing up there. HealthyMinds really solidified the practice of meditation for me. HealthyMinds is free and ad-free. \nThen I got into Stoa which is essentially an app based in the school of Stoic philosophy. It utilizes meditation as well but you perform the meditation through the Stoic method, essentially. Again, I enjoyed the educational aspect of this one as well asjust adding another approach to meditation to my arsenal. I enjoy attempting to carry the stoic mindset through my day. Stoa has a very user friendly free version.\nOak and Tide are both a little bit more supplemental for me, but I never delete them. I like to keep them on hand for their breathing exercises and soundscapes. Both have very user friendly free versions.\n\nCommercial timer app - Insight Timer. Non-for-profit introductory  mindfulness apps: - Smiling Mind, Mello (adolescent focus but ok for adults). Mantra - One Giant Mind.\n\nTry medito\n\nFitmind offers a free lifetime membership if you can‚Äôt afford their pizza subscription\n\nTry Sadhguru app\n\nI'd personally suggest trying out The Smiling Mind app and Atom. Atom helped me get started and it is well structured too accompanying that you are a beginner at meditation.\n\nYou have to try The brave way meditations  ! üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è https://www.thebraveway.co\n\nI use the Breathe app.\n\n[Waking Up](https://dynamic.wakingup.com/shareOpenAccess/SC9F00ADB) saved my life, theres so much content from so many teachers.\n\nThe link is a free trial, you can email them to request a free membership if its not in your budget and they'll give it to you no questions asked.\n\nI use both the medito and plum village apps. They‚Äôre both free with no ads and then have a good UI system\n\nListen to this whenever you are stressed https://youtu.be/s3dVeamMTpQ\n\nJust here to comment: YES, the UI is awful, I'm so glad I'm not the only one who thinks so. I held a subscription for a year but the UI was so bad I just stopped using it.\n\nAnother vote for the simplicity and minimalism of Oak. However, if you're looking for guided meditations, Insight Timer is probably your best bet :)\n\njust want to say I have the student membership for $10/year and have gotten so much out of it. they have free meditations on YouTube to try but their courses and sleepcasts have changed my life for the better, I also found Dora through it &amp; just finished an MBSR class with her which was an amazing and transformative experience. not invalidating your experience, but it really has been worth it for me.\n\nDo you have a Quest or Vision Pro VR headset? If so, I'd love for you to try Mindway out! It's designed to be a mindfulness experience that protects you against distractions and boredom, the two most common reasons people don't continue to use an app like Headspace.\n\nInsight Timer is bomb.\n\nHeadspace is truly terrible. Use balance\n\nMedito or Plum Village. FREE. The way it should be. Headspace was a $$$ racket from the beginning. If you see a subscription option for a meditation app which provides only static content you know what they are all about.\n\nI just had the same experience of refusing a request to refund an hour after the transaction went through. \n\nI won't ever re-subscribe to them. Whereas if they'd taken a reasonable approach I probably would have.\n\nHeadspace's refund policies are actually pretty good; they used to give out the app for free if you even wrote to them. But that was 2 years ago; I still use the app and find it extremely helpful. In general, mindfulness has been transformational and life and relationship saving for me. Get some app or service!\n\nHi everyone! \nI am doing a research on self-development and mindfulness apps. I would be so much greatful if anyone agrees to participate in a 5 to 10 minute interview. No personal question, only regarding the usage of Headspace app. Let me know if anyone would like to help out! :)"

Nowhere did I think I was close to enlightenment but i surely felt I was making progress with being calm and not triggered and trying to better myself as a human being but boy the family knows how to push all the wrong buttons. \n\nBut then again anyone can feel enlightened in isolation away from the world, it is only in relation to others that we truly find ourselves.\n\nRight? For growth to occur, we need times of rest and times to be challenged...  Mom's can be really good at super charging both of those lol\n\nThat's the tough lesson keeping calm when your mom yells at you at every other thing your freedom is taken away\n\nUsed to hear that family is one of the tools to accelerate evolution and proximity creates friction. I remember feeling all zen and strong after say a meditation retreat and the teacher would say, yea? Head out now into the real world! That's where the work begins! \n\nLook at it this way, in the past you might've had some serious meltdown! Whereas now, your awareness is shifting the way you react. I'd say, you're still on that fast track!\n\nI like to think that‚Äôs reality/universe/life telling us not to take ourselves too seriously lol\n\nWhy you leaving dirty dishes in the sink?\n\nAlso, it shouldn‚Äôt fly out the window because your mom is yelling at you. May be you haven‚Äôt progressed as much as you thought if that‚Äôs all it takes.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/tNA5qTTxFFA?si=KKGJlVYvowqdjFhZ Talks about this. The part of you that is the child role to your parents came out. The part of you that was enlightened took a holiday.\n\nHaha ü§£this is so relatable and true! And I think important to also give grace to yourself in these moments. Like it is part of your enlightenment journey which is a non-linear path. It never ends, so if you keep going, I think that means you are always there ü´∂üèº‚ú®\n\nGreat realization!. You‚Äôre only at peace, some of the time.  Then life shows up.\n\nWhich types of meditation have you done? I own inner engineering book by Sadhguru and did the program. Does Sadhguru mention anything about watching the breath while focusing on the point between eyebrows in the book?\n\nYou literally are having a divine revelation. I‚Äôm so happy for you. Thanks for sharing.\n\nSo what is the point of going through all that if nothing really changes?\n\nI can't help but think after reading posts like these, that a lot of people that meditate have very little mental fortitude. If someone calling you out for leaving out your dishes gives you that much stress, how can one even function in a profession? That sounds further away to enlightenment than most people before they start the journey of meditation. \n\nNot trying to be mean or anything, just a thought that popped up. My apologies if you meant this post as a funny joke.\n\nI mean, wouldn't it be hard to develop mental fortitude in a household that has been abusive since your developing years? I think that people who complain about not being able to stay calm around their parents have way bigger issues than the dishes themselves. I have no issue seeming \" enlightened \" around respectful and kind people. \n\nYou just end up stacking defense mechanisms and trauma responses all around, so yes, It is very hard to function like that.\n\nDishes just end up being a surface kind of thing.\n\nI, for example, had literal breakdowns when I would cook food wrong because I saw my mother growing up who didn't allow any kind of imperfection. It gave me an impression that things that are not perfect shouldn't exist, which is how she acted. And I am not even exaggerating at all. I am probably even downplaying the behavior here.\n\nMy point is that things are always deeper than they seem to be, just a perspective shift."

    "body": "Is there a name when even just existing becomes pleasurable? I've been so unbothered lately. I had heavy depression for over 15 years and tons of hypervigilance, anxiety and more garbage and my nervous system finally calmed down from my traumatic childhood.\n\nThese recent days I've just been calm and regulated. Even existing is pleasurable and I savor it any moment I can be present and do nothing. Its so nice but also it seems a little detached; Im very unbothered now and slightly absent-minded, like Im numbed by some drugz (just a little bit.) I wanna drift here for a while longer. Its like a distant place where \"you should be this\" doesnt exist. Its just slow, calm, being. Pleasure in just existing",

    "all_comment_text": "Bliss\n\nThe sensation of feeling pleasure simply from existing is often referred to as **\"ananda\"** in spiritual and philosophical contexts. \"Ananda\" is a Sanskrit term that means bliss, joy, or happiness, often associated with a deep, inherent sense of contentment and peace that arises from a state of pure awareness or being. This experience is characterized by a profound sense of well-being and fulfillment that is not dependent on external circumstances, but rather on the simple fact of being alive and aware.\n\nMasterfully said. Such accurate and in depth description!\n\nthe key to what you shared here is:\n\n&gt;*not dependent on external circumstances*\n\nOP, congrats. i hope this state of being stands up to the trials and tribulations of day to day life. often, it takes time to air out all one's past conditionings for good, and realign their way of being in all places and at all times.\n\nüôè\n\nGorgeous explanation. Many thanks\n\nHow sure you are that he experiences ‚Äúananda‚Äù? He is still dependent on external circumstances. A person who experiences ‚Äúananda‚Äù would not bother about depression or anxiety, he simply exists, but as you can see, he is bothered and sort of scared to be depressed again\n\nNobody is just one thing. \n\nWhat we perceive as 'ourselves' is actually a collection of selves - a collection of drives, desires and aversions that can manifest individually or in unison.  \n\nThis person's communication is completely congruous with their experience. It is natural to desire to grab on to that state, because the satori experience is so profoundly blissful, and the ego's reflex reaction is to try to own it - to master it so that it serves the ego. \n\nThe tighter the grasp, the more elusive that state becomes. The softer the grip the closer it remains. This is one of the reasons the Buddha said 'be neither attracted nor repulsed' - neither seek the satori state or be averse to it. Abide in your practice either way.\n\nHow the hell did you calm down your trauma brain nervous system lol I swear it's going to put me in an early grave\n\nMy guess: through consistent meditation.\n\nLong story. I saw healthygamergg's video titled \"this is your brain on trauma\" and he said long term depression is more likely to be nervous system related, rather than a mood disorder. I thought back and noticed I had hypervigilance, anxiety etc symptoms my entire life so I saw depression as a symptom (of a messed up nervous system) and started following his advice.\n\nI did too much, however. He mentions exercise, meditation and yoga. I did very high intensity exercise called HIIT and then I'd meditate after. Cold showers and then meditate after. From high activation to relaxation, almost like nervous system exercises. I stopped the intensity after 2 months. Now I just take 1 hour chill walks away from the city and find moments to just be, and a little bit of yoga.\n\nYoga and all these parasympathetic activities made me unbottle some repressed grief and cry for hours recently. Its when Im relaxed and with low bodily tension that I might get these much deeper feelings for processing. The sadness seemed endless at first, but it was different from depression cry. It had a reason and I processed some things. A bit of childhood wound and an old break-up that I was stuck on.\n\nThe mindfulness too. But I dont do it in a doing mode, like \"lemme do this exercise.\" Its very light, I do it because the presence itself is enjoyable. I might notice the air, the temperature, how I feel; I look out the window, let go of the bs in my mind, relax the tension in my body and mind, and my breathing might swiftly get deeper and calmer. I use the way I breathe and the way I feel to determine if I'm stressed or regulated\n\nPleasure just from existing started when I was stressed because of all the should be's and \"you need to be this\" and I thought to myself, you know, I wanna just be. They call it doing nothing meditation now. I didnt know that, I wanted to just be. And I realized it was enjoyable to just exist, provided you can mentally let go.\n\nAnd that's the difficult thing. The mental hurdle, the mental shift, being able to let go of the tension. It's a slow rewiring. We didn't get hypervigilance in a day. Back then I could be obsessing over something and not realize it. Relaxation didnt exist. It was anxiety and being tensed up 24/7. That becomes your normal. More stress and activation is easy to understand, its the same thing just climbing in intensity, but getting down into a completely different, lower, relaxed level is very odd, you never experience it. When I tried to calm down, I couldn't relax past a certain point, I'd start sweating, and my body (nervous system?) would resist and immediately reset it back to being tensed up again.\n\nDuring this journey it sometimes took 15 minutes or more for my body to enter relaxation. Sometimes never, but I'd chip away. Persistence was the last key. I'd sit there in anxiety, meditating, nothing happens, stuck there, but eventually I'd break through and my system would relax and let go. It felt futile to be staring at a wall of unchanging tension and your body being stuck, but eventually I'd break through. The good state is almost my normal now. I also dont feel helpless anymore and Im not even sure if I have depression. I'm monitoring myself for its symptoms and Im having a very hard time noticing it lol.\n\nI fought so long to \"just think different your way out of depression bro\" or thinking I need to find hope or purpose but none of it really did anything. This one tho, its an overhaul in my daily experience. I don't even get negative or hopeless thoughts out of nowhere. If I do for a moment out of habit, my system rejects it like \"whoah, this is effed up.\" I feel a bit of cringe and distance myself from sad songs. My system works differently now.\n\nMan, this is a wonderful answer\n\nDamn. What a great reply. Thank you!\n\nSeems to line up a lot with my experience just stuck in fight flight too often for too long. Only bad trip I've ever had on mushrooms was when I realized I haven't been content or relaxed in what felt like years. I can see how if I get out of this cycle just existing without the panic and muscle tension would feel amazing üôÇ\n\n  \nEdit: I actually bought his guide to ADHD and doing things a while back but the trauma content wasn't available yet. I trust Dr. K and resonate with a lot of his stuff so I might give the trauma guide a shot. Thanks again for your input, gives me something to prioritize at a time when everything is chaos.\n\nDo you think that 2 month period of intensive nervous system recalibration was necessary? Sort of like a catalyst?\n\nIm not sure. Its supposed to help with nervous system flexibility and to get it unstuck. Maybe relaxation only stuff is enough too, but Im still thankful for it. I had a burn-out, but when I stopped the intense activities, its like my system caught up on some sort of a relaxation debt and felt better than ever. I also processed some more traumatic grief yesterday and Im happy as fk and regulated since. I felt a fearful, inescapable sadness that created avoidance in me, when I meditated with it (was difficult) some some ancient childhood grief came up. I still dont relate to depression. Random update.\n\nThank you so so so much. I cannot thank you enough. I am so happy for you and how you went through you journey to feeling better üíñ‚ù§Ô∏è needed this\n\nI had a trauma brain and hyper vigilant nervous system. I am better now. \nCopious amounts of meditation, and lifestyle/career/thought pattern changes in conjunction with self administered psilbocybin mushroom trips. You must put in the work. Meditation was the pillar, for me.\n\ntrauma undigested memory. meditation give uou enough space to take care of them dont avoid the negative emotions\n\nTook me 42 years, but it was essentially telling myself that doing hard things - especially those things I avoid - is good for me. And to be okay with being uncomfortable.\n\nTwo years ago I was fully agoraphobic. Now I feel like I can do literally anything.\n\nYeah I'm going backwards... I quit drinking, got a degree, got in shape, was constantly doing stuff even though I was anxious. I think the stress it caused to face all that stuff with only negative motivation and no positivity has ruined my body. life is falling apart and I can't force myself to care enough to stop it üòê.\n\n  \nthanks for your input, I guess it's good to know it's possible lol\n\nI forgot to mention - no longer identifying with my thoughts and emotions.  That should be a given in this community, but it's a crucial part.\n\nOne of the main points of meditation is to bring your awareness to the present.  In the present, nothing is falling apart, it just is.\n\nThanks! üôÇ.\n\n  \nI definitely feel better when I practice at least occasionally\n\n[deleted]\n\nI tried it once and it worked way better than I expected but I haven't tried getting back into it, this is a great idea. I think a big problem right now is That my body is too messed up for me to do any proper cardio, TRE seems like a decent alternative.\n\nInto TRE ?\n\nTrauma releasing exercises\n\nfor me, Yoga.\n\nand through that learning to *experience* breathing (aka Pranayama).\n\nyouve recognized that happiness does not depend on your external experience. nothing to do now - simply be as you are.\n\nWhatever it is sounds good to me! Simply being. As someone currently dealing with treatment resistant depression and PTSD, may I ask what you atribute your healing to? And if meditation played a role, what technique do you use and how often do you meditate? Lots of questions there, but I am curious.\n\nLong story.

If I do for a moment out of habit, my system rejects it like \"whoah, this is effed up.\" I feel a bit of cringe and distance myself from sad songs. My system works differently now.\n\nThe book Hardwiring Happiness and the HEAL meditations completely restarted my nervous system. It gets a little repetitive but I swear by that book and refer back to it as needed.\n\nNot OP but I feel identical to OP. The best thing I think you can do is to practice mindfulness. There is mindfulness meditation but any meditation will be beneficial to start being more mindful and eventually, possibly being able to find joy in just existing. \n\nMindful means *conscious or aware of something* and through practicing mindfulness you learn to be more conscious and aware of things. \n\nI am unsure of the reason for this, but we tend to remember bad things better than good things. Because of this, I want to give you the personal tip to try to remind yourself more often of the good things. The things that bring you joy, that make you happy. A thing someone once said to you, a smile from a stranger, your favourite weather, the smell of your favourite food, it can be anything. And, believe in yourself. You‚Äôre worth your own effort!\n\n[deleted]\n\nbananza\n\nSelf-contentment. You are happy with the 'person' you are spending 24/7 with.\n\n*joie de vivre* - exuberant enjoyment of life\n\nEquanimity\n\ninner joy and bliss\n\nretirement\n\nLiving. I feel like that's how we should live life. It's challenging to get to that point so good on you for being in that state. \n\nAlso, it reminds me of the word, \"nirvana\". üòä\n\nI'm feeling this too! Loving being alive right now!\n\nHappiness!\n\nI love how everyone here is happy for OP.\n\nYou are describing something that sounds like the Satori state - the acausal, bliss-filled state. It's one of the traditional milestones in buddhism when one is seeking enlightenment. Satori is acausal - it manifests without any apparent cause or trigger in the practitioner. You could also simply be experiencing what your body feels like naturally when it's free of depression... the baseline state for a 'normal human' should naturally feel pleasurable. Best way to hold on to this state is to not hold on to it. Don't attempt anything that tries to manipulate it. Instead, just engage yourself in whatever your practice is.\n\nI am two weeks into meditating 2x30 mins per day and the feeling you are describing is appearing sometimes. Some new things start to matter more to me and I have no fear of missing out on anything, among a lot of other more healthy emotions things are beginning to align. \n\nMy ex-girlfriend's parents used to meditate for one hour each morning and they were the kindest happiest people.\n\nIm happy for my new habit and Im happy for you OP : ) lets keep it up\n\nHigh on life\n\nJust curious,  did this occur once you included time alone and silence? Since that is how I discovered bliss and what you describe.\n\nYES. My first time was sitting in a dimly lit room at 3am with my cat, literally doing nothing but exist and sometimes get tea.\n\nAwesome\n\nSuper happy for your progress! ü§ôüèΩ\n\nNirvana? \nThis is my one dream.\n\n\"presence\"\n\nI love this so much. I'm very happy for you. My wife and I started feeling this same sense of happiness from just being last year and actually started a business called Happy Just Being. It's so wonderful talking with people that live in awe of life itself!\n\nKeep thy mind in hell and despair not\n\nAtaraxia.\n\nThats peace.\n\nI meditate in the Buddhist tradition and use the Anapanasati sutta and once you calm down your breath (which calms down your body) you actively generate \"rapture\" or Joy, which is more akin to body bliss and then Sukkha, which is happiness, this is part of the path and meditation and comes from the mind. In fact, I taught myself and on retreat I've been taught by Thich Nhat Hanh that in using this sutta, you can practice the first half of it and generate this type of happiness everyday as you walk around and live your life.\n\nIt's happiness and joy in the here and now. The Buddha distinguished between a more raw volitile unstable joy, where as happiness is more stable, but still active. You generally want to settle those into a more neutral equanimous state\n\nEnjoy it bro to the maximum..I am now jn the midst of an anxiety attack now it is the 3rd day ..heart palpitations..nervousness anx waking up not alert ..\n\nI recall reading that : Existence IS Happiness. It is people who disturb their own peace. It is the natural state of human beings physically...however the mind is a terrible thing. To waste.\n\nEuthymia\n\nI think that‚Äôs a great sign you are doing you!\n\nIf you reach a state where you feel pleasure, which actually indicates peace from just being, that is a blessing. When we feel this peace that comes from meditation, there can be no greater benediction. But it all depends upon what we are feeling, why we are feeling, how we are feeling. Normally, depression is caused by the mind. Depression is a result of the aggression of the mind. The mind creates fear, worry, stress, anxiety, regret, shame and guilt. These thoughts that are being shot at us ¬†by the mind are more dangerous than AK 47. I call the mind‚Äî MK 50, the Mind Killer 50. We get into a state of depression, but if we have been able to find a way to get out of depression and live in contemplation or silence, there can be nothing better than this.\n\nEcstasy"

    "all_comment_text": "Some amazing realizations here. The only things I'd maybe offer an additional thought on are that I believe:\n\n1) Intention and action are equally as important. I can have the best intentions, but until I act on them, they are not reverberating. I can have the intention of serving others, but until I go out and actually feed and take care of others, the intention doesn't actually effect anyone.\n\n2) Love can be given AND received; don't be afraid to receive some love, friend :)\n\n&lt;3\n\nThanks, mate, for sharing your precious thoughts and reading my thing. \n\nConsidering the \"love\" issue: what I wanted to say that a fulfilled person is the one who shares / gives love. That's it. If the one's gifted to receive it from others that's even better, surely, but sharing goes first\n\n&gt; 2) Love can be given AND received\n\nIt can't be received though, all love comes from within. \n\nYou can interpret what you can see from other people as loving however what happens is that it allows you to create the feeling of love come from within. So it all coming from yourself.\n\n&gt;1) Intention and action are equally as important.\n\nYeah. One has to take accountability for one's actions even if the intentions were pure and good. \n\nOne can feed a dog and since you love both the dog and chocolate you want to share and so you feed the dog chocolate but sadly the dog dies because chocolate is deadly to dogs. So even though the intentions were pure and good it hard horrible consequences of the action.\n\n&gt; It can't be received though, all love comes from within.\n\nIt is possible to distinguish love that arises purely from within with no other cause but your own thoughts, and love that arises within you in response to the thoughts and actions of others. You can shift around definitions and abstractions to present them as the same thing, but in doing so you remove a fairly important distinction that is quite important for a healthy mind. \n\nIn a similar vein, you could make the claim that the mind works due to \"electrical signals.\" It's technically correct, but in saying so you omit a whole lot of very important insights and ignore a lot of other non electromagnetic physical interactions, all in an effort to simplify things down to a single idea. \n\nBeing able to receive the love of others is not implicit just because you are able to experience love for yourself. It may seem that way to some that have never had to deal with injuries related to this distinction, but if you're in that camp you should see it as a blessing, rather than a natural state that is easily accessible to everyone. It's sort of like saying everyone has two arms, and two legs. It might be true for most people that you've met, but the amputees are probably not going to receive that statement with a standing ovation.\n\nSure, once all is said and done it's supposed to evoke some very similar responses, however, if it does not then figuring out requires a lot more analysis and work where these sort of distinctions are the only possible way to navigate. You won't be able to fix it without understanding which part of this process is operating incorrectly, and you won't be able to even think of it in terms of \"parts that need fixing\" if you think it's all one thing that can't possibly be broken.\n\n&gt;In a similar vein, you could make the claim that the mind works due to \"electrical signals.\" It's technically correct, but in saying so you omit a whole lot of very important insights and ignore a lot of other non electromagnetic physical interactions, all in an effort to simplify things down to a single idea.\n\nWhile I agree to some extent. That doesn't really hold true if you say people that started out as pen pals. I don't see any of the \"a lot of other non electromagnetic physical interactions\" really coming into play here. Unless you believe that their love somehow is transmitted thoughts the letter. So unless that love then somehow isn't \"real\" or as true as with two people that meet. \n\nI'd still say that you're always in your own bubble and you never really get anything from other people. However finding someone or something that gives you attention, and accepting you and wanting you is a permission slip that enables/allows you to feel these emotions. \n\nThey were there from the start, and it's something YOU feel not someone else. You just didn't allow feel that love because it didn't have someone to direct it towards since people have a hard time loving themselves.\n\n&gt; It's sort of like saying everyone has two arms, and two legs. It might be true for most people that you've met, but the amputees are probably not going to receive that statement with a standing ovation.\n\nNo they probably wouldn't give a standing ovation, based on what was amputated, if a leg(no standing) or an arm(no ovation). \n\nIn my case, no ovation since I'm actually missing a left hand. 100% honest.\n\n&gt; While I agree to some extent. That doesn't really hold true if you say people that started out as pen pals. I don't see any of the \"a lot of other non electromagnetic physical interactions\" really coming into play here.\n\nHow so? \n\nThe act of a neuron firing can be described in part through electromagnetic or other physical interaction.\n\nThe act of a nerve triggering can be described in part through electromagnetic or other physical interaction.\n\nThe act of a muscle contracting can be described in part through electromagnetic or other physical interaction.\n\nThe act of a pencil leaving a mark on a paper can be described in part through electromagnetic or other physical interaction.\n\nThe act of the letter getting glued shut can be described in part through electromagnetic or other physical interaction.\n\nThe act of the letter carrier driving a car to pick up your letter can be described in part through electromagnetic or other physical interaction.\n\nThe act of photons bouncing or getting absorbed by the letter can be described in part through electromagnetic or other physical interaction.\n\nThe interaction of photons and cells in your eye can be described in part through electromagnetic or other physical interaction.\n\nSure, you're not going to have a specific formula to describe all of those, but that's mostly because that formula would be too complex for any mind or computer in existence. It's just the effect of everything being made up of electrically charged atoms. Essentially, you can't remove electromagnetic interaction from anything we do, because it literally makes up everything we do. At the same time, the vastness and number of these various interactions (both electromagnetic, and those depending on other forces) leads to outcomes far more complex than the basic description of any given property.\n\n&gt; Unless you believe that their love somehow is transmitted thoughts the letter. So unless that love then somehow isn't \"real\" or as true as with two people that meet.\n\nLove is an informational concept; it is transmitted through anything that can transmit information, be it spoken word, written word, or even non-verbal communication. You can't point to \"love,\" you can't box it up, but you can absolutely experience it, and convey it.\n\n&gt; I'd still say that you're always in your own bubble and you never really get anything from other people. However finding someone or something that gives you attention, and accepting you and wanting you is a permission slip that enables/allows you to feel these emotions.\n\nWhen you go on reddit and read an idea you don't agree with, you receive something that you would not have received were it not for the action of the other person that wrote the thing you disagree with. Same is true for any other emotion you can imagine.\n\nI see it as less of a permission slip, and more as a set of lighthouses that can guide someone along. Without those lighthouses you would not know how to make that journey.\n\nOf course you're still the one that has to make the journey in order to get the experience that comes with it, but without those waypoints you wouldn't even know the first thing about which direction to walk in, or how to avoid the many shark pits and circular traps that you can encounter anywhere.\n\nNote, this is true for not just love, but any other informational experience. \n\n&gt; They were there from the start, and it's something YOU feel not someone else. You just didn't allow feel that love because it didn't have someone to direct it towards since people have a hard time loving themselves.\n\nAgain, this is spoken as someone that's never had to deal with it not being there. When you've never been apart from this experience, it obviously feels like it's always been there, because it has.\n\nIt's sort of like dealing with any other disorder. The people that have never experienced such an injury can't actually relate to it, because they've never experienced what it feels like for it to not be there. From that perspective it's very easy to go \"Well of course it's always there.\" Mental structures capable feeling of it *not* being there literally would not exist in that case, and imagining this sort of scenario is sort of like imaging what it would be like to get your 9th hand; you know, not quite as intense as the 8th, but way more fun than the 7th. Which probably doesn't say much to someone with the normal human 2.\n\n&gt; No they probably wouldn't give a standing ovation, based on what was amputated, if a leg(no standing) or an arm(no ovation).\n\n[That's the joke](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xECUrlnXCqk).\n\n&gt; In my case, no ovation since I'm actually missing a left hand. 100% honest.\n\nImagine the very same thing, only internally within your own mind. Literally just missing capabilities that exist in most people. Ones that are not fixed by just learning to experience love for oneself, but where the act of loving oneself is just one step on a long and complex treatment path. Similar to how the last few decades have been a long and complex path of humanity slowly learning to integrate robotics and neurology until eventually in a decade or two you might literally be able to just go and install a robotic hand that works and feels like a human one.\n\nThank you for your detailed response! ü•∞\n\nIf someone else is a necessary part of the equation then no it is not \"all coming from yourself\" even if you are also a necessary part of creating that feeling\n\nI think he or she only meant the actual Result of the actions when he/she wrote¬†\"Intention is more important than the result of action\". Simply meaning if the outcome isn't what¬†you wanted or thought¬†it would be, the most important thing was the initial intention.¬†\n\nthank you for sharing!\n\nThanks for reading :)\n\nI have the feeling that you are seeking wealth.\n\nAnd I would say Karma is entanglement‚Ä¶\n\nyou have ascended high, well done\n\nThanks for reading!\n\nVipassana is the oldest known meditation technique. This is true. The other things you described are not true. Vipassana does not deal with the external world. You do that in this post.\n\nWhat you write is not for us, but for you. This is the teaching you have acquired, but you do not understand it. By writing this on this forum you want confirmation that there is truth in what you write.\n\nSo, as a practitioner I will say this: What you wrote is not true.\n\nI am not sorry about what I wrote, because I do not care.\n\nYou didn't cover the compassion part yet then\n\nCompassion is the the best and the hardest thing to achieve. Gratitude and compassion are actually the true keys to be evaporated of any practice, relation or whatever\n\nThanks. I don't need any confirmation. Just sharing what I've learned without any expectations. If you don't agree with that, there's nothing wrong. And most importantly, Vipassana for sure is not the final key, but just one of many instruments of reaching inner peace and going deeper into spiritual realms\n\n&gt; Vipassana is the oldest known meditation technique. This is true. The other things you described are not true. Vipassana does not deal with the external world. You do that in this post.\n\nThe lessons of Vipassana to not ask you to distinguish between the external world and the internal world. You experience what you experience, nothing more. If you chose to draw such boundaries, then that is at best a tool to aid in understanding, and it's one that is very much optional.\n\n&gt; What you write is not for us, but for you. This is the teaching you have acquired, but you do not understand it. By writing this on this forum you want confirmation that there is truth in what you write.\n\nSharing something does not necessarily mean searching for validation. Plenty of people share things knowing that others will disagree.\n\nThere is a natural instinct for humans to organise and present the information within their mind to others. That said this isn't selfless action, just as you observed. People share things to satisfy a desire to organise their thoughts, to shape the ideas, and to send those ideas into the future. Perhaps someday, someone might find these ideas and use them as a stepping stone for further exploration. Or perhaps nobody but a few people and a bunch of AIs will ever read it, and that's ok too.\n\n&gt; So, as a practitioner I will say this: What you wrote is not true.\n\nHow can you say something is or isn't true, unless you can explain what true actually is. Do you claim to have the insight to the absolute truth that nobody else does? There are a lot of practitioners here after all.\n\nThe only thing you can say is that you do not see your version of \"truth\" within those statements, because that's the only thing you can possibly know. That's just as valid a statement as those you are replying to.\n\nWhat you wrote is just one perspective. I respect your opinion. But, I think otherwise. I still stand by what I wrote. I will only add the word \"vipassana\" means \"seeing things as they are\". So it is a practice of direct observation of one's own experiences, without judging or interpreting them.\n\nDirect experience of the reality of oneself, this technique of self-observation is precisely Vipassana meditation. It has nothing to do with the outside world. In the language spoken in India at the time of Buddha, passana means: to look, to see with open eyes, in an ordinary way; but Vipassana means to see things as they really are, not as they appear to be.\n\nEverything else is a superstructure and interpretation of Vipassana teachers, especially by S.N. Goenka, who popularized this technique in the West. It is a bit like explaining the unification of the original Christian gnosis by successive papal councils.\n\nIn other words, Vipassana is not a church and you are not its priest to tell people things that are not true or not.\n\nI mean, yes. We're both sharing our own individual perspectives.\n\nThe act of judging and interpreting is not part of \"Vipassana\" it's part of \"being human.\" A person is not just a Vipassana robot, not even a guru living deep in the mountains. You can use Vipassana to deeper your understanding of the human experience, and there's nothing wrong with doing so. \n\nThe phenomenon you use Vipassana to experience is the phenomenon of being a person with a body interacting with the physical world. This body is constantly exposed to stimuli relating to, and originating from this so called \"outside world.\" Where and how you chose to make this distinction is entirely a personal matter, one that is not even guaranteed to be stable day to day, and as such trying to use it in a discussion is not meaningful.\n\n&gt; Vipassana means to see things as they really are, not as they appear to be.\n\nCertainly. Vipassana is a technique of mastering and directing awareness, without allowing anything to affect that awareness. The fact that you start by directing awareness within yourself is just a convenient starting point, but it's hardly the only possible thing that you can be aware of. \n\n&gt; In other words, Vipassana is not a church and you are not its priest to tell people things that are not true or not.\n\nI believe you were the one that said:\n \n\"So, as a practitioner I will say this: What you wrote is not true.\"\n\nYou're the only one that's claimed to tell people that something **is not true**, so please heed your own words. What you wrote can not be true, nor can it be false, because the very idea of \"true\" and \"false\" are personal constructs. Trying to use those terms in relation to the practice of others is a meaningless statement because their understanding of \"truth\" is likely nothing like yours.\n\nI am infinitely grateful to you for showing me the only correct interpretation of what is in my head. Thank you for your words of encouragement and understanding of my selfish attitude in seeing things as they should be, not as they are.\n\nHmm, that's strange. I thought my post was all about my own interpretations and ideas. Why would I know or care what goes on in your head, beyond the understanding that it's probably not what goes on in mine? \n\nIn my view we're all selfish. That's why I believe we're here having this discussion. I mean at least that's why I'm here making these points. It's certainly not because I care about what someone else thinks is \"correct.\" It's because I want to write down what I think is \"correct,\" regardless of who agrees, or what they agree with.\n\nThe only thing I asked of you is to live up to the standards you've verbally set out for others.\n\nAre you okay?\n\nOP, i am also planning to go on a spiritual travel to Nepal. Any tips? Also, where did you managed to have a vipassana meditation? Thanks in advance\n\nThe road to hell is paved with good intentions.\n\nI assume the words of Jesus were misinterpreted or never been said in that manner. You got a Hebrew/Greek origin of that phrase? And how do you connect it with what had been said in the post?\n\nFourth bullet point.\n\nThere are many techniques of meditation. It's one of them. An ancient one. Might wish to explore other forms too :)\n\nIm from Canada but really went on a whole journey on this during my time living in Asia. I‚Äôd been to Nepal and India but only has a traveller and never as a seeker. I am so intrigued by going back and learning more / experiencing \n those environments. \n\nWhereabouts in Nepal did you practice ?\n\nThank you so much for this. Really helped me alot"

I'm going to give it a try.\n\n:)\n\nDon‚Äôt take any notice of  foolish superstitious comments .. if you find this old practice helpful and rewarding keep it as part of your routine ..\n\nI used to think this was stupid. But it's all about the mentality of it. You can do some interesting things thinking about your identity while looking at your physical form. \n\nThe inside and the outside never match all you ever see if the expression of the external form. \n\nIf you don't look at it, especially in motion what can you really ever know about what you're communicating to the world?\n\nYes very well said.\n\nIt can be powerful, but it's a challenging exercise. Some people may need to make more progress in other areas before looking in the mirror stops being a painful and unhelpful activity.\n\nI was raised Catholics and When I got my confirmation, as part of our studies we were sent to this one day camp-like workshop experience. And for some reason one of the exercises was just staring into a hand held mirror for a while. At the time I didn‚Äôt even recognize it as meditation. I was probably 16. I can‚Äôt remember much of that day except that one thing. I think we may have recited a few things together in front of the mirrors, but then  we just sat and had to stare. It was interesting.\n\nScripture treats self-love as a given. For example, in, \"Love thy neighbor as ye love thyself.\", it is assumed that you love yourself. However the subconscious, especially in children is prone to absorbing negative messages, and parents plus society accidently(sometimes on purpose) pump in these negative messages thus creating a false belief system in the child. \n\nSelf help teachers have long suggested gazing in the mirror and using self love affirmations. They say people have a really hard time of it at first.\n\nI couldn‚Äôt agree more. I used to be ashamed of looking at myself in the mirror. I would always throw myself down and call myself ugly, and had so much self rejection and so much self-hate. Now I look at myself in the mirror and tell myself that I love myself and I am worthy. It felt funny at first. But the more you ease into it, it just feels natural. It‚Äôs incredible how much meditation can truly change your perspective. I get happy when I see myself in the mirror and I tell her that I love her. She made a lot of mistakes in her life, but in the end we have our only selves. ü•π We learn!\n\nIf you would like to go deeper, try a scrying mirror. I can see myself, but it lets me focus on what's going on behind the face better.\n\nInteresting point ü§î ...In art class when doing self portraits we each were sitting in class with our own little mirror, staring in it for the length of the class... so, that might also lead to additional insight (just a thought) ... so then you combine looking at yourself in the mirror and the contemplation and focus that drawing /painting / making art requires ... also makes me think of Frida Kahlo,she was doing this too, self-portraits making up like 1/3 of her works...\n\nI've done this exercise for many years, i used to start seeing my hole Body then my face and after a few minutes just focused on my eyes and pupils. \"Searching for the conciousnes that was looking at itself\" sometimes i would have deep disasociations from my identity, and then from that state go back to the face and then the Body, all insecurities and personal critiques where seen from a different perspective, super profound experiences with this one.\n\nThank you ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π\n\nMeditation is just meditation. Idk why do u follow occult practices.\n\nüôÇ\n\nThis is neither your body, neither your own mind is yours. When you do stuff like this, It would be an easy job for demons to visit you üòÄ\n\nClassic Fiddlesticks main\n\nL o L\n\nSounds like the demons are already visiting you üòÄ\n\nThere's no need to fear the demons, they are more scared of you."

    "all_comment_text": "This feeling you‚Äôre experiencing, the embarrassment and shame, is merely a **transient cloud** in the vast sky of your consciousness. It might seem heavy and permanent in the moment, but the truth is, it‚Äôs just a passing feeling‚Äîlike any other thought or emotion. **Pure awareness**, the part of you that is the true essence of who you are, is the **sky** that holds everything, including these feelings, without attachment or judgment.\n\nYou are not the cloud, not the fleeting feeling of shame or embarrassment. You are the **sky** that watches these feelings come and go. The light of God shines through this sky of awareness, illuminating every moment with infinite love and acceptance. When you look to the sky, you can see that all things, including your thoughts and feelings, are simply **temporary** and **not who you truly are**.\n\nShame and embarrassment arise from identifying with the thoughts and stories you‚Äôve built around yourself, especially the belief that you are somehow unworthy or that others will judge you. But in the light of pure awareness, there is no judgment. **You are already whole**, you are **already loved**, and there is nothing wrong with you. In fact, the **light of God** is always shining upon you, guiding you, and loving you unconditionally. The idea of ‚Äúwrong‚Äù doesn‚Äôt even exist in the pure space of awareness. There is only **the truth of your being**, which is love, light, and boundless potential.\n\nThis feeling of **low self-esteem** comes from forgetting who you truly are. When you identify with thoughts like \"I'm worthless\" or \"I'm ashamed,\" you lose touch with your true nature. The **pure light** within you is always there, waiting to be recognized, just as the sky is always there regardless of the clouds.\n\nThe truth is, there is **nothing to be ashamed of**. You are made of the same pure light that radiates throughout the universe. You have the same divine essence as everything and everyone around you. Your self-worth is inherent, not based on your thoughts, actions, or others‚Äô perceptions of you. You **cannot do anything wrong**, because you are part of a divine flow of love and consciousness. The more you identify with this **pure awareness** and allow yourself to simply **be** in the moment, free from fear or self-judgment, the more you will feel a sense of peace and acceptance.\n\nAnd regarding relationships, it‚Äôs important to understand that true connection comes when we show up **authentically** as our pure selves. When you stop hiding behind fears of judgment or shame and allow your true essence to shine through, you will attract relationships that are in alignment with who you really are. **The people who truly resonate with you** will appreciate and love you for your uniqueness.\n\nSo, the next time you feel embarrassed or self-conscious, remind yourself that these feelings are just like clouds‚Äîtransient, not defining your worth or your truth. Instead, turn your awareness to the **sky of your true being**, the light of God that shines within you, and know that **you are loved** exactly as you are. You are **whole**, and nothing can change that truth. There is nothing to hide, nothing to fear, nothing to be embarrassed about. **You are pure light**.\n\nI needed this\n\nI was attempting to convey this message to a friend just yesterday. You have expressed it perfectly. üôè\n\nThis is literally helpful for me. What a nice comment!\n\nThis guy lives up to the name. For certain, trust your sky, trust the light, and shine on soul brother\n\n&gt; You *cannot do anything wrong*, because you are part of a divine flow of love and consciousness.\n\nBet you I can do some wrong stuff. You know what humans are capable of, right? It's not all pure love and light down here on the surface world.\n\nThis homily on self worth relies on there being a magic \"light of god\", or magical \"sky of your true being\". OP, without a god-magic myth, we are loved, safe and worthy as conscious beings- no superstition necessary- by relying on principles of science and mental health, and secular buddhism and meditation to find peace and well-being.\n\nBest answer here, thank you\n\nThis is a terrible response. This person needs help, not a pep talk\n\nThat's kind of what I'm feeling too. Like instead of all this light of God talk he just needs a wing man kinda\n\nWhat if, and I am by no means suggesting OP is, but what if, he was a paedophile? Would that undermine any of your statements?\n\nIf you think there's anything that can make someone undeserving of love, that means you believe in conditional love, which means you also deep down believe you don't inherently deserve love, and that love is conditional for you as well\n\nNone of what you just pointed to is Who You Are. Everything above is just a figment of the mind that vanishes the second you let it go. How do you stop it? Learn to let those thoughts go. Learn to allow things to be as they are. Doing so, your self esteem will rise naturally, you gravitate towards that which you like, and the unfounded shame will evaporate. Thats the beauty of meditation. It lets you see those erroneous thoughts and beliefs. Now what are you going to do with them? My advice is to let them go and watch as the rough path smooths itself out.¬†\n\nProductivity cures depression and low self esteem. Figure out a few things that are difficult for you to do but will make you feel better about yourself. Whether that is exercise, developing a new skill or hobby, going out on dates, or simply being more social. Force yourself to do it, learn, and improve. In one month, you will feel very different. In one year, you will transform.\n\ngreat job at recognizing it so early in life! most people go their whole lives and never see it. Love the part that thinks this way as it's a protection mechanism (at some point it helped you in some way, believe it or not)... and watch as it dissolves. Don't try and battle it, don't try and make it go away. If you do that, you will actually feed it.\n\nOh okay do just do as I have and continue meditating.\n\nI say this as respectfully and supportively as possible: the sentiments described here and the sexism displayed in your post history go hand in hand. While I can‚Äôt know for sure, someone who has the feelings that you do based on your dozen or so recent posts (that women/feminism are responsible for the majority of your cohort‚Äôs problems) is almost certainly projecting that vibe in conversations with women. This puts them off, which makes you feel worthless, which either consciously or unconsciously makes you blame them, which repeats the cycle. \n\nFeminism is not responsible for your problems. Feminism is one of many many *things* that have happened, and some aspects have been positive and some have been negative. The internet, Covid, the economy, the way cities are planned and developed, all of these things and many more are all inter playing with each other to cause the world to be what it is, and hyper focusing on one just makes you blind to the rest, and wrongly fixated on one specific outlet you try and use to make sense of your unhappiness. \n\nUnderstand that the women who have treated you wrong are also products of poor treatment, just as you are. It‚Äôs a cliche but hurt people hurt people, and that only stops once you can recognize this in yourself and start reacting to hurt people, both externally and yourself, with love and understanding. Truly try to understand why the people you interact with are the way they are, relate to them in the ways you are the same, and use that understanding to forgive them and be better. There‚Äôs nothing else to do than that.\n\nMeh\n\nCould‚Äôve guessed that would be your response. Your sexism will be the root of a lot of suffering for you, I hope someday you connect the dots\n\nLmao bro U assuming my life is kinda funny.\n\nIt's just meh. I don't hate women, I hate modern feminists, a good bit of them are miserable just like me in dating.\n\nU need to chill.\n\nEdit: weirdos who think I fantasize about murdering women at 11pm In my pitch black dungeon , please stand down. And try to separate the \"females\" from feminism. There are alot of actual moderate women who wave a feminism flag. Just chill and breathe. I have female friends and I do not wish to hang them.\n\nSexism is not hating women. Sexism is viewing women as objects for your fulfillment; it is not perceiving women as human beings. \n\nTelling people to ‚Äújust chill and breathe‚Äù when you‚Äôre the person asking for advice is a good one. üòÖ \n\nThinking many feminists are miserable ‚Äújust like me‚Äù is classic projection.\n\nYou might want to check out r/Jung. I‚Äôd stay away from Joe Rogan-Jordan Peterson-anybody who calls themselves an ‚Äúalpha‚Äù, or who refers to human social behaviour in animal terms. You will never have any kind of fulfilling human relationship if you start seeing the world on their terms. Good luck\n\nüòë U guys are annoying and you're all over the app just downvoting and attacking people based off their post history.\n\nWhite knight weirdo behaviour\n\nEdit: Know what lemme ignore that , what about Jung will help my situation.\n\nYou aren‚Äôt getting downvotes because of your post history, if that were the case every comment you made here would have been downvoted, but they‚Äôre not. It‚Äôs the comments where you‚Äôre calling people annoying weirdos and telling them to chill in response to genuine, considerate advice. In other words, being defensive in response to people who aren‚Äôt attacking you. \n\nI understand that you might not agree with the advice given, and that‚Äôs fine. But none of what I see in this thread has been presented in an aggressive or condescending way. And a lot of people that are referring to your post history probably have personal experience with others in their own lives who have gone down similar rabbit holes and ended up worse for it.\n\nAnyways, I can relate to a lot of what you posted, and I would echo a lot of the things people like u/GodlySharing have commented in terms of advice. I think it‚Äôs great that you‚Äôre acknowledging the shame and embarrassment you feel, because that first step is one of the hardest parts. Keep it up\n\nJust wanted to make a point here -- according to the comment above, thoughts and ideas in our mind can be likened to clouds, which is a great analogy so I would like to extend it a little.\n\nSome ideas are positive, so they will be like white clouds.   Some ideas and thoughts are negative, so they are like black clouds.  \n\nBlack clouds bring thunder and lightning and storms, and negative ideas and thoughts bring their own thunder and lightning in the form of conflict. \n\nFeminists are just people doing people things.   If you were born a woman and experienced what these women experienced, you would very well be a feminist too.   They are just doing what seems logical to them to solve their problems. \n\nLikewise, you are also just 'people doing people things'.   You do what seems logical to you.  \n\nSo if you hate 'people doing people things' that will necessarily extend to yourself also.   There is lot of truth to the saying 'the way you do one thing is the way you do everything'.\n\nSo your dislike of feminists created conflict and drama in the posts responding to you, and probably on your dates as well.\n\nSo one 'life hack' is that the more you can remove the dark clouds of negative thoughts and ideas from your mind, the more your storms and conflicts will be removed from your life, leaving only sunny days. \n\nSo I don't know if this will land, but it goes to the heart of your dislike and shame about yourself.  In order to remove your negativity about yourself, it is also important to remove your negativity about other people -- you are all just people: people doing people things.\n\nIt sounds like you have an awful lot to unpack.  We all need help sometimes.  I would suggest you get some professional counseling to help guide you through and out of these feelings.  \n\nWith your need to consume information with an inability to communicate, it would be good to be tested to see if you are on \"the spectrum\" ADHD, autism, etc.  Growing up with these challenges can negatively affect your mental state and how you interact with life.\n\nKeep up with your meditation, and may you find all the joy and happiness you can handle.\n\nI have heard that if you want to build self-esteem you have to do esteemable things. Also this worked for my insecurities with my body/ self-image. I heard that if you spend 30 minutes a day with yourself naked- you will start to get comfortable with your naked body. It works. Also give yourself loving caresses during the naked time. Like a sensual hug, put lotion on your legs and feet with a slow massage. If YOU won‚Äôt love your body, you certainly can‚Äôt expect anyone else to! If YOU are repulsed at yourself then how do you expect someone else to be attracted to it. I promise you don‚Äôt have to be in great shape in order to attract a woman! If you love your body, she will love it. \nYou should also look into forgiveness for whatever it is you are hating yourself so much for.. whatever it is, you need to leave it in the past. Everyday you have the choice to start over new. Everyday you have the choice to be who you want to be. Seek your Higher Power (mine is God) for the humility grace and forgiveness that your soul desperately needs. Something that helped me realize how ironic my self-loathing was is this: ‚ÄúI sure think low of myself , but I think about MYSELF A Lot!‚Äù So egocentric.. we think we are nothing but dang we think of ourselves 24/7 ü§Ø so we need to take the focus off of ourselves and honestly helping others is a GREAT way to start feeling good about yourself. You could start by holding the door open for others, letting someone go ahead of you in grocery line if they only have a few items, asking the cashier how they‚Äôre doing and giving eye contact and a smile. Change starts with one moment at a time. You could offer to carry something heavy for an elderly person, or offer to mow an elderly neighbors yard or rake leaves for them. \nI started doing positive affirmations which help ALOT!!! Whenever my old habits start to say inside my head ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt do this I‚Äôm so fkn stupid‚Äù I will STOP IN MY TRACKS &amp; say ‚Äú___my name, you CAN do this- you are NOT stupid, you are learning new things every day, you CAN do this!!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúChanging your thoughts will change your life‚Äù\n\nWrite down all of the traits, behaviors, beliefs, and habits of the person you want to be. In other words, what would the most fulfilled version of yourself look like? Create a strong ideal for yourself and then just start embodying the person you want to be.\n\nThanks for the actionable advice haha.\n\nI don't work well with quotes and stuff. Though experiments and actual actions  alone works. Maybe I'm On the spectrum I guess\n\nYou must learn to let go.  We are not defined by our past.  Be present in the person you wish to be and move forward you are already him. Give yourself grace and ask for it prior to meditation. Acknowledge and accept who you were then let it go! üòâüôèüèΩ\n\nSo I read through your post history.\n\nYou‚Äôre talking about things with some valid points, but you fail to understand the bigger scope of what‚Äôs going on in people‚Äôs minds with how the world looks right now. I could go into specifics but that‚Äôs not why you posted. \n\nDisregard your idea of ‚Äòknowing‚Äô and fall into the role of ‚Äòbeing‚Äô. You can‚Äôt understand people by acting like you already do. We all make connections in our daily lives that lead us to conclusions that become things like our morality, ideals, goals, ego, etc. The world doesn‚Äôt fall into cohesion because people form their own bias opinions and reactions based on environment and exposure to the very small world we live in. We disagree because it‚Äôs not really possible for us all to think the same way. We all live different lives with similar patterns. There‚Äôs hundreds of combinations for how a person can be, and you‚Äôre looking at things from only one viewpoint.\n\nHave you tried to step into the roll of other people? Truly and honestly try to see through their perspective, live an aspect of their life in your mind? The people you hate most, or the ideal you disagree with vehemently, have you tried to see from that perspective? It‚Äôs worth looking into the psyche of others. Not only does it help with your own self image, but how you perceive others. \n\nYou say you‚Äôre embarrassed of yourself, but the person you are inside isn‚Äôt embarrassed. If your soul was embarrassed about who you were, you wouldn‚Äôt be who you are. Your true sense of self is buried underneath layers of emotions that don‚Äôt need to exist. You have a lot of anger not just towards yourself, but others in the world who are nothing more than strangers to you. So do I, I‚Äôm not going to lie. It‚Äôs like the weather. Some days are clear, others are stormy. That‚Äôs how everyone‚Äôs lives and emotions go. Everyone has flaws and if they didn‚Äôt they wouldn‚Äôt be human. \n\nAnyway, put away social media. Stop speaking before truly listening and understanding. It‚Äôs one thing to know something as a fact, it‚Äôs another to understand it as a concept. That‚Äôs my honest advice.\n\nA woman or any other person should never play any role in how you perceive yourself. Only you can decide how you see yourself. Don‚Äôt get so down on yourself, love yourself, respect yourself, you have no other choice but to do this or face a life of self hatred and misery, just let all the negativity go. It can‚Äôt touch you unless you let it\n\nMeditation is a powerful method to remind us of basic goodness within ourselves, but most times it does not touch the core of trauma where your broken self-sense lies. In fact, meditation can become a practice of avoidance, and unfortunately this avoidance of trauma and shadow is rife among meditators especially in the west. It‚Äôs called spiritual bypassing. \n\nIf it is helpful, finding a good therapist who specializes in trauma might help you find a way to begin investigating where, when and why this self-esteem wound occurred. These wounds most often occur before we can even talk, so rational thought cannot dislodge it. ‚ÄòThe body keeps the score‚Äô as they say. \n\nKeep meditating, as it will continue to help you cultivate safe space in which to encounter and feel what you need to digest and integrate. But meditation alone is unlikely to do the actual work for you. \n\nBig hugs, man\n\nSometimes you just got to decide it's your turn to own the room.  But first, you got to get out of your own way..\n\nYour beliefs create your reality. If you believe negative things about yourself your subconscious will seek out evidence that supports those beliefs and ignore any evidence to the contrary. The good news is you can change your beliefs.\n\nLearn and apply ACT, metacognitive awareness, compassion (including self-compassion) and mindfulness. \n\n\n1. Identify your core values. \n\n\n\n\n2. Set goals in line with those core values. \n\n\n\n\n3. Prioritise pursuing your value based goals and always embodying those core values (for example, if a core value is compassion, you can embody that in all of your interactions). \n\n\n\n4. Learn and practice in the moment, applied metacognitive awareness, mindfulness, self-compassion and defusion. \n\n\n\n\n5. When unpleasant thoughts/feelings come up that obstruct you from pursuing your values and goals, ask yourself: is it helping me to ruminate on these things? (It's likely not). And then apply mindfulness, self-compassion, and/or defusion techniques to disengage from the rumination/worry and refocus your attention on your core values and goals. \n\n\n\n\n6. Rinse and repeat.\n\n\n\n\nAsking yourself metacognitive questions like: \"Is this worrying helping me?\" \"Am I acting as if it's possible to stop worrying?\" \"Am I treating these thoughts and feelings as if they're permanent or impermanent?\" Etc. are different from the object level approach where instead you ask: \"Are these thoughts true? Am I really worthless?\" Sometimes we are being an asshole, sometimes guilt, low self esteem are appropriate if we're not acting in line with our values, but that doesn't mean that ruminating on these thoughts and feelings will help us; in fact it makes it much more likely that we'll spend more time ruminating and doing nothing else, thereby making our lives worse. Such emotions and thoughts are helpful insofar as they signal what actions we should or should not take; e.g. if you feel guilt then the appropriate action is to evaluate if that guilt is valid, and if so, make up for what you did wrong, but if not, to let it g. Such thoughts and feelings are unhelpful if instead we treat them as things we need to hyper-focus on. \n\n\n\n\nBy doing the above you're solving all elements of the equation. 1. The immediate unpleasant thoughts and feelings are dealt with/released. 2. You're progressively building a life you value and love, creating less and less material for the ruminative, self-critical parts of your brain to focus on, and instead creating material for you to feel good and confident about. 3. Pursuing your values means that you're more likely to be hanging out with people who share your values and interests; you can then start organic conversations with women who share your values and interests, based on those values and interests, and be much more likely to find a partner. And the bonus being, whilst you're single and seeking, you're not bothered, because you're living a life that you value, you don't feel the desperate need for finding a relationship, because you're happy on your own. \n\n\n\n\nTwo of the best ACT self help books are: \nGet out of your mind and into your life - Hayes \nThe Happiness Trap - Harris \n\n\n\nCompassionate Mind by Paul Gilbert is a great book on self compassion. And here are some great guided practices on that: https://soundcloud.com/dennis-tirch-phd\n\n\n\nLoch Kelly's: The Way of Effortless Mindfulness will provide additional micro-meditations you can apply throughout your waking, off the cushion life, to disengage from rumination/worry, etc. \n\n\n\nDefusion techniques are still relatively unknown; they are very powerful techniques that can DE-FUSE you from these ruminative processes.\n\nThank you\n\nI'm going to read the happiness trap. I've started that book around 2021 when I was really depressed and overweight. Didn't do anything. What got me out was working out and getting in shape but I'm still kinda depressed.\n\nMeditation lead me to the insight seen in your post and now U led be right back to the book. Full circle. I think this is for a reason and I'm going to do it. Thank you again.\n\n\"The difficult part about change is to make a different choice then you did the day before\". Dr Joe Dispenza. I am myself on way to self-search. Started meditating to overcome low self esteem and overthinking, struggling to relax , and to become more focused. The thing is meditation really helps, after 6months, maybe not as much I expected but it helps. If you don't do it , you should try. Try to accept things the way they are, even if you feel urge to do differently, focus on good things even how little they may seem ,but thats the way.\n\n‚ÄúIf it doesn‚Äôt challenge you, it won‚Äôt change you.‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúYou are the sum of your everyday habits‚Äù\n\nQuite simply just release this attachment to your ego. It is unnecessary.\n\nSimply? I don't think so.\n\nThere's nothing complicated about ceasing a habit you've practiced your whole life. Simply stop.\n\nDoesn't mean it's easy.\n\nThere's a thought that is in the back of your mind that keeps you from expressing yourself and that messes up your train of thought where you get a blank. It could be worry that people wont like you. You're judging yourself too harshly and putting all this emphasis on being some ideal person worthy of being liked. \n\nYou might want to try a martial art, or something else like that where there is a lot of camaraderie and you get to see yourself improve at this difficult thing which builds confidence in yourself. \n\nand/or you could see if there are any local groups centered around the things you like. Those people will be way more fulfilling for you to be around. \n\nTherapy will also help you integrate those parts of your self that you feel ashamed of. It'll shed light on a lot of things you're holding yourself back with, usually due to what your environment was growing up. \n\nWhat really helped me let go of those worrisome thoughts about what people were thinking about me was the realization that other people aren't focused on me. They're just like me and trying to navigate their own day. They're worried about something too and have their own unique journey of accepting all parts of themselves. From there I felt like I could instead be a more curious person and see what they have going on today. I let them talk without feeling that pressure of filtering themselves. It's exactly how I would want to be treated. Once we feel more at ease, I don't have that feeling of caring whether they like me or not. Who I am isn't the things I like anyway, it's how I treat myself and others. \n\nThere is a book I was recommended that talks about this called I'm okay, you're okay.\n\nJust hang out with people who share your interests.  Going to a bar and talking to a chick about chess openings or modeling stls in blender to print your favorite anime character will never work.\n\nSo if you arent a normie, avoid normies and seek your people.  Good luck.\n\nI'm not that much far on the spectrum. I know that at least turns people off. Thing is , I don't know WHAT to say. I go blank alot of times. No book advice ever sticks. \n\nThe best time I ever spoken to people was when I took mdma and in the afterglow phase. It just flowed out my mouth. I could just feel how fun I was.\n\nSince then there's been nothing really, I even feel kinda depressed.\n\nFORD method, \"family occupation recreation dreama\" is a good place to start for topic ideas.  Sports and weather are to be avoided.  \n\nI get you man.  Im older now but was the same.  Chick would go out and smoke a cig one on one with you and mind goes blank and you blew the moment\n\nIf it‚Äôs true that you‚Äôre worthless, then we‚Äôre all worthless. We‚Äôre not meant to be perfect. Accept who you are in this moment, notice the negative bias you have towards yourself. I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs so much good and positive shit about you, but your mind doesn‚Äôt really work in a balanced way.\n\n‚ÄúThat is so me‚Äù is a phrase I learned to think when I screw something up. ‚ÄúBut of course, that is so me.‚Äù And just laugh at it. How you view yourself is yet another thought. And if you‚Äôre anything like me, your mind give you just the worst possible interpretation, but I wouldn‚Äôt se you like that. I‚Äôm too busy with my own self doubt.\n\nAs for the girls stuff, I‚Äôm more of a lonely fella, but getting drunk works. It turns off this whole process of how does she see me how do I do this but I don‚Äôt want her to think this, which can be a nightmare for an overthinker.\nAnyhow you‚Äôre 20, if you learn from everythinng, about yourself and the world, you‚Äôll be fine.\n\nTake it easy\n\nThe past is just a memory, a creation of your current mind.  Like if you look back in 10 years from now but maybe that future you are in a relationship etc...then you will just realize it was silly to feel that way. Come back to the present moment of who you are now where anything and everything is possible. The last changes as you change in the present moment. I hope this makes some sense!\n\nI repeat again and again: there is no bad meditation. None. I think we need to stop setting a goal. It's a path. This is Samantha's path. It‚Äôs contemplating your chaos, observing your little monkeys and listening to the outside and the inside. Meditation is not intended to make you unhappy!\n\nMay I suggest the book The Courage to be Disliked? I used to be ashamed of and dislike who I am. That book changed me. Can‚Äôt guarantee it will help you, but wanted to share.\n\nRead \"The Power of Now\" by Eckhart Tolle\n\nYou are not your thoughts or even your perceptions of them. Your true being is the witness, the conscious awareness of the thought manifestations themselves.\n\nThat's it.\n\nI‚Äôm sorry that you feel this way! I wish I could hug you, because I was you about 10 years ago. I felt like an embarrassment to myself and would routinely tell myself things like, ‚Äúyou sound stupid whenever you open your mouth, so stay quiet‚Äù and ‚Äúif people get close to you, they are going to realize how awful you are, so stay aloof‚Äù. It‚Äôs an awful feeling. I did a partial hospitalization program for a month in order to address my poor mental health, and that was the beginning of my healing period. \n\nIt‚Äôs hard to say what causes negative self-perception, but it‚Äôs probably a number of things. If you are not surrounded by genuine people that gas you up for the majority of your life, that could be part of it. Trauma can also manifest as low-self esteem. I think that you are doing a great job of identifying your emotions and seeking answers. Perhaps therapy could help you determine specific strategies to help you cope with your apprehensions.\n\nIn the meantime, practice being kind to yourself. If you are noticing patterns of negative thinking, disrupt them and do positive affirmations. Try to join a club or group and explore new hobbies. Exercise, get sleep, and eat a balanced diet. Take care of your grooming and wear things that make you feel confident. And most importantly, realize that this feeling will not last forever. Early 20‚Äôs are fraught and challenging for so many people! It‚Äôs often a decade of self-exploration, and sometimes it takes time to figure out what you need and who you are. Like me, you will find things falling into place and you‚Äôll start to feel better every day. You will still probably have bad days or depressive episodes, but your conscience will be kinder and you will recover more quickly.\n\nJust hang in there. ü©∑\n\nI haven't read all the advice here so I don't know if anyone else has suggested this. The primary top goal in life is to be yourself as much as you possibly can be. To fully express your youness to the max. Towards this goal you need to start reprogramming your subconscious. Never underestimate the power of affirmations because they shift your subconscious beliefs and these beliefs are what projects your reality that you then experience back. You believe you're worthless, well that belief is going to create that reality for you. Every girl you meet is going to reflect that belief you hold right back at you. So a simple affirmation to start with is 'im an incredibly interesting, mercurial guy' - if saying this makes you feel uncomfortable then it is bang on the affirmation for you. Sit down and focus hard on the affirmation as you say it, feel the feeling the words engender in you. Do this for ten minutes each morning and each night. Adjust the affirmation as you see fit to benefit you. Do this for a month and things will change. But remember the affirmation is not for your ego it is just clearing the shit beliefs you've somehow adopted off the top of you to let the real you shine out.\n\nThe object of life is to be 'friends' with the persona that hangs around you 24/7. If you hate yourself, then the downstream effects of this produce posts like this.\n\nYou stop this by developing the self-discipline necessary to (in your case) force kindness upon yourself. Meditation is kindness.\n\nSo, as others have said self-esteem and worth are general uncertainties. They may describe how your current subconscious pattern aligns itself but they could never be more than just that just patterns.\n\nAs part as displaying sexual interest, I'd give some cookie cutter advice. Just own it.\n\nGet practice at being the person you want to be. The version of you in your head that talks about what he wants to talk about and does so clearly. Who understands sexuality and isn‚Äôt intimidated by romantic connection. Meditating builds your passive awareness of yourself. Simplified, think of this flowchart -&gt; Where is my breath? What are my thoughts? What am I feeling? What am I sensing? What am I doing? How do I want to do this?\n\nStay aware as you practice. You can button mash your way through Smash Bros and be fine. But if you take time to learn what you‚Äôre doing, you‚Äôll do great. Awareness is kinda similar.\n\nHow does this apply to shame and hating yourself? Well, to be honest, shame at such an intrinsic level can be learned in childhood and hard to unlearn. I have found that meditating alone wasn‚Äôt enough for me, I needed to know how my brain functioned and how emotions work and how shame is learned. Learning about Psychology has helped me meditate by making things easier to understand as they come up. Maybe instead of just attacking shame head on, dig deeper. What caused that feeling initially? Parents? Bullies? Religion?\n\nBy being the person you envision, the person who isn‚Äôt held back by shame, you show yourself that it‚Äôs safe to be interested in what you‚Äôre interested in (barring psycho shit, but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs what this about) and it‚Äôs not stupid. It‚Äôll feel awkward at first. And it‚Äôs not particularly comfortable and it might not feel ‚Äúgood‚Äù but does it feel refreshing? Exciting? Did you do what you wanted the way you wanted to do it? Follow that. The more you do it, the more comfortable it feels.\n\n\nYour sexual feelings are natural and nothing to be ashamed of. Really. Like, that‚Äôs not just something sex ed teachers say, take it to heart. You can be as sexual or asexual as you want, but desiring sex or a relationship is not at all something to be ashamed of. I would take steps to address this before really getting into a relationship though. You‚Äôll find you have a lot less anxiety day-to-day.\n\nI dunno dude, I saw some of myself in your post and this is some stuff I wish I heard and some stuff I‚Äôve learned. Best of luck dude, it sounds like you‚Äôve got a good head on your shoulders. Don‚Äôt sweat it too much. It‚Äôll pass as long as you learn to let it go.\n\nI do ‚Äúthe Work‚Äù by Byron Katie which is a process to question stressful thoughts. What I love about it is you are the one that does the work and gains its benefits. The work doesn‚Äôt require agreeing with anyone or taking on any philosophies.¬†\n\nHey I‚Äôm a therapist so I want to put a disclaimer here that this is not therapeutic advice- I would look into cognitive distortions and EMDR (which is what I practice). We identify NC (negative core beliefs) about ourselves that have formed throughout days of your life day 0-present.\n\nThat negative core belief needs to be combatted by a PC (positive core). For example : I don‚Äôt deserve to eat (anorexia) vs. I DO deserve to eat (healthy). Another example in my sessions we change and dig into the root of this feeling, where did it start? Why?\n\nBest advice for healing is: BE AUTHENTICALLY YOU! The people THAT ARE FOR YOU WILL LOVE THE AUTHENTIC YOU, once you live authentically you will be loving yourself more everyday. Remember to give yourself grace as you heal and start your shadow journey.\nSincerely, a trauma therapist.\n\nFree will doesn't exist per Robert Sapolski, the leading expert in determinism.\n\nThis means you now have a cause and effect. No \"it's because I am bad/good\" identity-centered reasoning.\n\nWhat's happened in the past was the result of innumerable circumstances and what's done is done. The one thing we can do is shift ourselves to face a new direction, centimeters at a time,  hope our behaviors follow, and reshift again when it's necessary.\n\nIf you're working toward the shift, you're doing your best. It's counter intuitive to growth to be stuck in shame, but I understand it's hard not to cringe.\n\nIt can feel necessary to punish ourselves, but it only ends up affecting us and others negatively. How we talk to ourselves influences how we interact with others.\n\n\nYou're a dynamic, growing consciousness!\n\nHey, you‚Äôre not alone in this. The fact that you wanna change already puts you ahead of the game. Start with something small, like sharing one thing you‚Äôre into, no big deal. It‚Äôs okay to feel awkward; just take it slow. You don‚Äôt need to be perfect, just be yourself. Be easy on yourself, you‚Äôre figuring it out, and that‚Äôs totally fine.\n\ni know everyone already responded but remember we are all divine love equally. no need to be ashamed.\n\nDude. Go to therapy now. Visit with a psychiatrist. You‚Äôre so young that you can turn this around in less than 10 years and you can lead a happy life. \n\nYou‚Äôll also eventually learn that a lot of people your age feel the same way. You have a head start on many of them because you want to change. Just seek out help. If you can‚Äôt afford it, look into free help. I promise it exists and there are people who actively want to help people like you. I can‚Äôt even explain how much of a head start you have on most people who feel the way you do just because you‚Äôre at this point at such a young age. Just don‚Äôt be like most people and wait 20 years before you do something about it\n\nSo much good advice here. Honestly beautiful. The ACT suggestion is my fav because it basically says \"here look kid , there's entire books on the thing you're talking about and oh, it incorporates meditation techniques\" Hard to say no to that one. But also it sounds like I'm already helping myself and changing , just by recognising that this is my problem.\n\nI will keep on pushing and improving however slow.\n\nSelf Compassion by Nell\n\nIf you don‚Äôt cringe at the past, it means that you are not growing.\n\nHey everyone,\n\n\n\nI recently came across a YouTube video that I‚Äôd love to share here.\n\nIt‚Äôs a meditation that I found super relaxing.\n\n\n\nIf you‚Äôre looking for a calm moment for yourself, this video might be just what you need:\n\n\n\n\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMvJtao41oQ&amp;t=117s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMvJtao41oQ&amp;t=117s)\n\n\n\nHope it helps you as much as it helped me. Enjoy your meditation! üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚ú®\n\nIf you are fortunate , ladies will be complicating your consciousness for many years to come. It‚Äôs not so bad‚Ä¶. If you learn something.¬†\n\nThese feelings are coming up to be released. Feel them deeply, breathe and let go. I‚Äôm 64 and still have them come up. The feelings get stuck in your body over time when you aren‚Äôt able to move through them for whatever reason. A lot of them from when you were a child. You can move past this. Keep meditating.\n\nThere are many opinions and judgements in this thread, some have merit, some have less. But mostly I do not see many of them as very helpful.¬†\n\nYour negative beliefs about yourself are self-fulfilling. You believe you are self-conscious and timid with women, so you act self conscious and timid with women. The result is that you don‚Äôt take chances, which ultimately protects you from having to face real rejection, or worse, having to expose the person that you don‚Äôt like to someone else.¬†\n\nThere are several things that can help:\n\n1. Mindfulness meditation (vipassana or zazen) can help you see these things for wha they are: passing thoughts that have very little meaning or value. This will help you stop taking the thoughts so seriously. It takes time, but not so much in the grand scheme of things. A good teacher can go a long way.¬†\n\n2. CBT - a qualified therapist can help you identify the underlying assumptions that you are making and challenge them. This can be very effective.¬†\n\nIf you can, try both. I hope you find more peace. As someone who hated themselves for longer than you‚Äôve been alive, I assure you, you can be better. But you have to start by recognizing that the problem isn‚Äôt you or anything about you: it‚Äôs the thoughts. And thoughts can be changed.¬†\n\nThe first thing to realise is that everything you believe about yourself is a construction, like a story. It leads to real feelings, but the story itself is not real.\n\nIf you can find some truth in this assertion, the next step is a little experiment. It's difficult but helpful. Go to a social gathering where you know you will meet those people only once. Don't have any expectations from the gathering, even if you meet nice people there do not befriend them, don't share numbers, whatever. Your objective is the experiment. it should exist in a sealed off bubble.\n\nThe experiment is this. Choose for yourself a persona that you think you are not. Loud, talking to strangers, asking questions, sitting in the front row of seats, whatever it is that you think you are not, be that. Do that. Ask the question, talk to the stranger. \n\nRemember, this experiment has no real consequences. Even if everyone thought you were silly, it does not matter. If the speaker thought you were rude for interrupting, it does not matter. If people thought you were brilliant and eat out of your hands, that does not matter either.\n\nWhat matters is that you should be able to clearly see that your idea of who you are is simply an impermanent construction, and can be challenged and broken. \n\nOthers on this thread have offered the fundamental philosophical insights that make it so. I am asking you to trust these learnings, and put it into practice. \n\nAnd then, once the experiment is successful, then ask yourself...Even as my self changed entirely, what was it that remained unchanged? That is the light, the sky others are talking about.\n\nDo you have someone, a brother, best friend? Someone with whom you can truly be yourself? When you meet someone you‚Äôre interested in pretend you are in the presence of that person who doesn‚Äôt judge you. Sure you may be a goof ball or say something that might sound awkward but your personality will shine through. And that is who you want your special person to know. Who ever your are meant to have a fulfilling relationship with will love the person you are and the one who disengages will have saved you time and heartache in the long run because they are not meant for you. \nTurn off overdrive. Overthinking opposes fearlessness. Thinking too much about a situation can lead to chaos and fear surrounding your dating issue. Your mind can sabotage the first impression. Think of a good introductory line or just go in blindly. Whatever comes out allow it and own it. You are a work in progress just like everyone else. But you are obviously lovable and unique. Whoever sees the diamond in you will be the lucky one.\nOr you can do what I always do‚Ä¶invoke the Holy Spirit or your Higher Self by asking that part of you to ‚Äúdrive your mind and body‚Äù for you. I live by it and the Holy Spirit has never failed me.\n\n3,3\n\nPress 3rd mudra on both hands.  Hopefully, that will repair your relationship issues.\n\nYes, using thumb and the third finger.\n\nDo you. It's tough to trust out instincts, when we feel they've maybe let us down before. But that's how we fine tune and hone-in, focus on what you Love doing. Become the magnet for all you seek and desire,  for You are Inseparable from what you desire. That is (perhaps) why we desire what we desire so. Your desire, desires YOU.\n\nBe direct and confident in yourself because that‚Äôs what women are attracted to a man who knows his own thoughts and is able to clearly express himself unashamed and respectfully\n\nHuge emphasis on RESPECTFULLY.\n\nRun out and buy these two books and do every exercise.\n\n\nNo More Mr. Nice Guy\n\n\nSacred Sexual Healing The Shaman Method.\n\n\n\n\nThis will change for you as soon as you do this.¬†"

It's good to have at least a few people around us to keep us sane, but if you'd rather tend your own garden than socializing a lot in big groups, it's a valid choice.\n\nI'd literally rather sit in a damp basement for a week staring at a wall than go to an event like an arena concert or burning man.\n\nYou're on the right path.\n\nAs an introvert the path of least resistance is to be in solitude and be in my own head space. I have to make an effort to socialize or put myself out there. It‚Äôs dangerous for me otherwise. Keep that in mind but if you‚Äôre happy and content then do you. Just a heads up.\n\nSame!\n\nHmm. I think i could understand becoming more content with time alone thanks to mindful reflection, especially if you have relationships for the wrong reasons, like validating your self worth.¬†\n\n\nThat said, meditation never made me want to isolate myself, except to actually meditate. It has helped me cultivate more intentional and productive alone time for sure, but it also makes me feel more connected to other people if that makes sense? When I'm dedicated to my practice, I find that I feel closer to my friends, and strangely, I feel closer to strangers too? Like lots of serendipitous connections.¬†\n\n\nDo you practice Metta at all?\n\nMaybe the social gathering you would enjoy is one where people are into the same things as you.¬†\n\n\nAre there certain aspects in farming that your are passionate about and would enjoy nerding out with other people?\n\n\nAre you into permaculture, foraging or other outdoorsy stuff?\n\nIt's perfectly fine to like being alone or just hanging out with a small group of friends. It's a choice that someone makes and it doesn't always mean they are living in an unhealthy way. People have their own ways of feeling comfortable and what they need from social situations. What really counts is if you feel good and are satisfied with your life. Make sure you don't let what other people think control how happy you feel.\n\nLove this!\n\nI relate 100%! I too am more happy and relaxed at home aka my sanctuary! I think it's a common thing for ppl who are spiritually awakened. We can't be satisfied by superficial engagements and conversations.\nBut it can feel lonely sometimes not having a community of people with the same interests/beliefs! I for one crave  sth like that ü•≤\n\nSometimes we need comfort, not a bad thing. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs only bad when we crave adventure but can‚Äôt pursue it because we‚Äôve gotten too used to the comfort. Also like someone else here said sometimes ppl that are super outgoing and social just don‚Äôt have ppl at home to talk to (emotionally at least).\n\nEdit: I went through a bad anxiety induced isolation period, something that helped get me out is leaning into the curiosity ‚Äúwhat‚Äôll happen next if I do a good job socially?‚Äù Or ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs this persons deal/why do people like them so much?‚Äù And taking morality out of it- like accepting that deep down I‚Äôm an idiot just like everyone but I can work on things just like everyone. Also paying attention to the warmth of feeling like ur a part of something greater than urself (obviously you can get this from a lot of things not just parties/hangouts but still)\n\nyou do what feels best for you!! everyone is different and everthing is always changing. maybe this is just a phase, maybe not maybe you are a person who is content with themselves and the place they call home. thats beautiful! not everyone will experience that in their life (a lot of people are so scared to be alone, their lives evolve around this without them even knowing), enjoy your life how you want it!\n\nVisualise with me; your favorite color is blue and you have a lot of clothes that you like that are blue in your closet. You tell this to a person and they say things as: ew I find the color blue horrible, i could never buy blue shirts.    would you doubt your own preference and think you are doing something wrong? Maybe you should throw away some shirts and replace them with black ones, right? because then youd feel muuuch better.\n\nOf course! That person that told you that, doesn‚Äôt truly understand what it really means to be an introvert! Honestly, people can be a lot, the world can be a lot! The more we understand ourselves, I feel like the less we want to be around other people! And that is totally normal and most importantly, okay! You do you and do whatever makes YOU happy!\n\nIt's been like this for me too. I'm so happy in my own company that I only want to hang out with someone if it makes the experience more enjoyable. A lot of people don't do that for me. But also sometimes I need to hang out with people a little bit, if no friend is available a trip to the local eco-store or caf√© will do the trick.\n\nWhy would it be unhealthy? Would you question the behavior if no one else did?\n\nSame for me, when I‚Äôm around most people, I‚Äôm not enjoying it. Of course there‚Äôs exceptions but it is very few and far between. I‚Äôm 30 and the people I connect most with are 50 or older lol. \n\nNo I wouldn‚Äôt and I know I really need to work on letting go of what people think but finding it really hard\n\nThen we're the same age :)\n\n\"What other people think of you is none of your business\"\n\nLowkey my dream to have a house in nature with some animals and in a loving relationship, good for you :)\n\nIt will come for you one day ‚ù§Ô∏è It hasn‚Äôt been easy getting here and it‚Äôs a lot of work but I‚Äôm spending my days enjoying it and I think that‚Äôs what matters most at the end of the day!\n\nAs long as you aren't hiding to isolate yourself it's fine. Some people are just naturally like this. \n\nIf you consider it and are sure this is what you really want, just let the critique go they don't matter.\n\nThese are the kind of people that say \"cheer up\" to depressed folks not understanding how insulting it is.\n\nI also am happy being in my own company most of the time. After reading the Michael Newton books and those trained by him and seeing the accounts of souls and their growth (or lack of it) I realize I should make more of an effort so I decided to volunteer in a care facility. There I can use the skills life has taught me, help others and also enjoy the social connection myself ( which is not idle small talk, drinking and partying which I avoid and don‚Äôt like). It gets me off the couch- which I‚Äôm sure isn‚Äôt a problem for you! away from the tv and doing something meaningful. I do think we are meant to help each other while we are here, especially those who have a need and aren‚Äôt currently being helped. Just one perspective on the subject.\n\nThis is exactly how I feel and have become.\n\nQuality over quantity..always\nWhen ppl have countless followers or fb friends..do they really think these are meaningful relationships? Maybe..the ones that will be there during times of need or will there for moral support and genuinely cares for you and the friendships are true gems‚Ä¶so rare though \nI have blocked or removed contacts on my phone..esp the ones that are so needy and gossipy and emotional vampires..too old to put up with bs..\n\nI can relate to being home on the farm with someone you love!!!\n\nThose people who said those things to you were projecting their own fears about being by themselves onto you. Don't listen to them.\n\nI love my own company. I love my animals and my gardens. I love and have such gratitude toward my friends and family who understand and respect my need to be alone. \n\nSurround yourself with those people, and don't worry about the ones who have to throw their own fears at you so they feel better ... forgive them, for they know not what they do and all that. ;)\n\nPeople are by far the lowliest creatures on the planet ,so I understand. I prefer to have animals, wild and domestic around me, and trust a mountain lion more than the average human.\n\nThe soul selects her own society then shuts the door\n\nI can relate. I'm at a similar point in my life, but I've noticed it comes in waves. Prior to my consciousness \"waking up\", I was extremely extroverted, to the point that I was seeking validation with everyone else but myself. After beginning my spiritual path, the scales have tipped significantly, and I now enjoy being an introvert at home and in nature. It's easy to feel like I should be going out more or making more friends when comparing myself to most others in my life, but ive learned not to beat myself up over it and accept that this is the karma I must work with at this point in my journey. I know at some point I will be ready to tip the scales again and become more social, except this time I will aim to serve others instead of seeking their service like before. You may find the same to be true for you one day. For now, accept what is because there's nothing else but the path that has already been laid out for you :)\n\nI get you. I had an overabundance of socializing well into my 30's, and then I was done. Married my best friend, moved to a remote location, have 5 dogs and love quiet time, self reflecting and the great outdoors. I am happy with just that.\n\nI think the state of mind you are in is to be cherished\n\nYou're content and happy which is more than a lot of people can say. It's perfectly fine to not be as social as others. You've found a way of life that works for you and others shouldn't make you feel bad because their way of life is different. I hope you continue to stay true to yourself and keep living your life in a way that's comfortable and enjoyable for you.\n\nYou‚Äôve found happiness in your solitude, but the fact that others‚Äô opinions hurt shows a bit of attachment to their approval.\n\nTrue contentment doesn‚Äôt need validation. If being on your farm brings clarity, that‚Äôs great‚Äîjust make sure it‚Äôs not a way to avoid discomfort.\n\nThere‚Äôs no need to fit society‚Äôs mold, but check in with yourself: is your solitude freeing or is it hiding something? Face that honestly, and you‚Äôll find real peace, regardless of what others think.\n\nI definitely have more self work to do as I find letting go of my ego is extremely hard and something I‚Äôm really trying to work on. I grew up with a family that was more concerned about the way they appeared than actually being healthy and happy and it‚Äôs been a hard thing to unteach myself, but I‚Äôm working on it. Thank you.\n\nYou‚Äôll never fully get rid of the ego and that‚Äôs fine. The real work is noticing when it takes over and not letting it control how you feel or act.\n\nYou were raised to value appearances, and breaking that conditioning is hard, but you're already making progress by recognizing it. Just keep doing the work and don‚Äôt expect perfection.\n\nI find this to be a lot like the ocean.  Sometimes calm, sometimes very scary.  Sometimes the tide is far out, sometimes very high, all of these conditions happen with people too.  Then, there is the question of if you are sitting on the beach watching a sunrise or sunset, or trying to surf?\n\nAs long as you feel fine, it's fine.\n\nI‚Äôm so jealous you‚Äôre on a farm!! Trying to find me a farmer guy to get out of city hell &amp; crappy people. But as a single woman I can‚Äôt go live that country lifestyle like I did growing up in Alaska because the careers are in the city :( but if I went out w someone I loved double income or I could work remote that‚Äôd be heaven! I say you‚Äôre a step ahead!\n\nIf you want it badly enough, you will get there üíó \nMy husband and I have been together since our teens and we made a ton of sacrifices to be where we are now and took us about 12 years to get there. It‚Äôs been very hard but rewarding. \nYour farmer is out there waiting for you!\n\nAww so happy for you both! That‚Äôs beautiful! Feel like I missed my window but I‚Äôll keep trying and having faith! Thank you\n\nLet the fake people and the ones trying to benefit from you go.\n\nI live alone. I have a dog. I live a continent away from family. Mostly work from home. Life is good. Much better to talk to clouds, birds and trees than be surrounded by shitty people. You are doing ok.¬†\n\nIt‚Äôs hard to find truth with so much chatter. Congratulations on finding your peace üôè\n\nThis is why so many of us fuck off to the woods and/or mountains.\n\nlol well you hit the nail on the head, my husband and I are moving to a new property that is extremely rural and will be off grid on 86 acres.\n\nSee‚Ä¶.\n\nI relate to that.  That‚Äôs why I got so deep into a community that combines meditation with relating, [Relatefulness](https://relateful.com).\n\nI would get frustrated with people because they didn‚Äôt understand what I was going through with meditation.\n\nThis also true for me...\n\nAbsolutely, I can relate, and I am your equal in that I love just being on my property, pottering around looking after it, building things etc etc. I, too, have thought on the things you talk about and always come to the same conclusion, you will always gravitate toward what best suits yourself. I don't feel lonely at all, I bet you don't either, I don't feel under engaged in life at all, I'd bet you don't either....go with the flow.\n\nI agree it‚Äôs fine to have alone time. It‚Äôs fine to want to avoid huge crowds etc, but socially engaging with other people is important for us to exchange thoughts and ideas and for our psychological health.  Like the OP said, start by trying to find individuals who share similar hobbies and make sure you at least develop some social connections."

    "body": "For the last 4 years I have been holding on to anger and resentment. I've had it since childhood but it really came to the forefront of my psyche after my ex fianc√© left me. For years I couldn't seem to let my anger go or forgive those who had wronged or betrayed me. I tried but I just couldn't help thinking about it and getting angry and wishing to do bad things to these people. You would never guess I'm angry because I'm a very calm and chill person but it ate at me on the inside.\n\nI read a book recently called Why People don't Heal and it all clicked for me. I just have to forgive people. Now every time my angry feelings and thoughts arise I just say in my head \"I forgive you\" and then those thoughts and feelings just go away. It's really that easy but took me so long to finally figure out.\n\nAnyways I don't know if it will work for you as well without having the breakthrough moment that I did but it's worth a shot and that's why I'm sharing. If you are able to practice forgiveness in every moment of anger you experience it will lift so much weight off your shoulders. It's really similar to meditation too you just have to remember to say \"I forgive you\" any time you feel angry or hurt by someone.\n\nAnyways I hope that helps someone. It's been life changing to let this anger go.",

    "all_comment_text": "Forgiveness is a great thing to practise but sometimes when you can‚Äôt forgive someone even if you try it‚Äôs essential to accept your inability to forgive and just meditate on that - this provides a relief as well. I usually just notice during meditation sensations associated with my inability to forgive and that helps. Later usually forgiveness just happens naturally.\n\nYeah, there are people who have done my family and I wrong and I do not forgive them. I don't want to and I don't think it would be right or just to. I accept that what they did was wrong and I don't ruminate on it though, so it doesn't negatively affect me.\n\nThere is no right or wrong. Acceptance is key to moving thru a challenging experience. U don't ever \"GET OVER\" anything, u get thru it. Acceptance is  underrated.\n\nI like this a lot, thank you\n\nSensations like heat or cold?\n\nForgiveness is not an action we take. It‚Äôs not about accepting what happened to us. \n\nIt‚Äôs a process that we surrender to,\nwith a beginning; where we set an intention to be free of our past, \nA middle; where through much contemplation and internal negotiation- no longer fight to change anything and here we learn to process our grief. \nAnd an end; where the process comes to maturity and gives birth to a wisdom that now stays with us as an embodied experience.\n\nI relate to this more than just ‚Äúforgiving‚Äù someone to move on.\n\nWow thank you so much for this üôè\n\nüôèüèΩ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nThis is how I‚Äôm processing. I‚Äôm in the middle. Looking forward to the final surrender of letting go what someone did to me.\n\nI really like ur perspective. Thank you.\n\nI ran across thus the other day and found it useful. Hopefully you will too.\n\n*Forgiveness is giving up all hope of a better past.*\n\nEdit: I should have noted that this also includes self-forgiveness. Sometimes the hardest (and most necessary) person to forgive is ourselves.\n\nI felt that, thank you for sharing.\n\nMe too. Namaste.\n\nI am happy for you, friend. Your post reminded me of what Thich Nhat Hanh writes about in How To Relax.\n\nDon‚Äôt consider anger, hatred, and greed as enemies you have to fight, destroy, or annihilate. *If you annihilate anger, you annihilate yourself.* Dealing with anger in that way would be like transforming yourself into a battlefield, and tearing yourself to bits. If you struggle in that way, you do violence to yourself. *If you can‚Äôt be compassionate with yourself, you won‚Äôt be able to be compassionate to others.* When we get angry, we have to produce awareness: ‚ÄúI am angry. Anger is in me. I am anger.‚Äù That is the first thing to do.\n\n¬†Breathing in, I feel my anger.\n\nBreathing out, I smile.\n\nI stay with my breathing\n\nso I won‚Äôt lose myself.\n\nSounds solid. Good. Om\n\n Thank you for posting this. I carry around heavy anger and resentment towards someone too, and know it‚Äôs toxic, but haven‚Äôt been able to forgive or let go. I‚Äôve read Michael Singer and David Hawkins, but still can‚Äôt quite get there. \n\nI‚Äôll try ‚ÄúWhy people don‚Äôt heal‚Äù thanks for the suggestion and I‚Äùll start trying to say/think the words ‚ÄúI forgive you‚Äù when I get triggered.\n\nResentment is skin to drinking poison and expecting the other person to die.\n\nI love this quote!\n\nTy, I do too. I heard it at an AA meeting. It helps me to not get too attached to unhealthy ppl &amp;/or things that are said or done. Instead, I do my best to pray or send positive vibes their way. Then, I feel gratitude for my blessings and perspective on life. I am not perfect at it, but I do try to be mindful of it. Blah blah blah, that's enough of that. Have a great weekend!\n\nüíñüôèüèª\n\nI never understood this quote\n\nLet's say ur angry. U r wishing, hexing wanting the other person to feel your wrath. Meanwhile, they have no clue or don't care. It's an unhealthy emotion to be stuck in. It raises your stress, your heart beat, your blood pressure, and it does zip to THEM. That is why resentment is a poison, if you drink it, it is gonna hurt you and not them.Therefore, resentment is like drinking poison and expecting the other person to die. Does this help?\n\nStories of great forgiveness help a lot. Like when a man was trying to have the Buddha executed and spat on his face but the Buddha just smiled at him with pure love. Or Jesus saying \"forgive them for they know not what they are doing\" while he was being tortured and executed.\n\nThat book I recommended has many modern and practical stories of forgiveness that helped me understand. I hope it helps.\n\nüôèüèª thank you! Without sounding overly dramatic, I really feel like it‚Äôs my life‚Äôs purpose to overcome this heavy and negative egoic energy, and come to some sort of equanimity around the details of my trauma. When I‚Äôm in my rational brain and out of my emotional and wounded part, I can feel some of that equanimity and recognize that ‚Äúthe perpetrators‚Äù were only doing what was available to them given their level of consciousness (ie forgive them for they know not what they do). But the wounded part is still wounded and somehow needs more. ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nthere is a spiritual tradition that is all forgiveness: r/acim\n\nYes OP! I also recently realized that forgiving others is what I need for inner peace. Sounds counter-intuitive at first, and I‚Äôm having a hard time doing it because my ego thinks my anger is the only one really looking out for me, that my anger is what‚Äôs protecting me from emotional pain. Typing that out I can see how ridiculous it looks from the outside - ‚Äúobviously‚Äù my anger is itself a main part of the emotional pain and at this point I‚Äôm the one doing the hurting, not those who are living rent-free in my head. I think I‚Äôm not the only one stuck at this point in the process.  I‚Äôm so glad to hear OP broke past that and the grass is greener on the other side!  Have to have hope that inner peace can be achieved or I won‚Äôt try. Thanks for sharing!\n\nnice that it works for you but this sounds very /r/thanksimcured lol\n\nIdk - to me it sounds as if they have had an aha moment, and sharing it kindly while thanksimcured ones are from folks who have no idea what some of us are going trough...\n\nHahaha, I'll never be cured. I have learned to move thru it. For example: if I get an injury, I will have a scar with me forever. I can choose to focus on it, let it make me feel ugly or be angry or I can choose to accept it, acknowledge it and go on about my day\n\nLol right? A year ago this post probably would have made me angry. It's taken me a lifetime of dealing with anger to get to this aha moment though.\n\nYes, it is a process. For me, it started with getting clean and me finding a HP(God, nature,etc). Then, meditation and prayer AND practice, then repeat.\n\nIt does lol but do you have issues like this and have you tried something like this? I came to see compassion is a game changer when it comes to my internal experience. Sometimes it's as easy as flicking a switch like noticing tension and then letting it go/accepting it/forgiving myself and poof\n\nGratitude has been a game changer for me Why be negative all the time? I have to do X,Y&amp;Z anyway so why not be more positive? That perspective has changed my life 180 degrees. I am living my best version of myself.\n\nI absolutely relate up to many details. It's almost like I wrote this... anyways I read about people who fully overcame their anger and forgave to eventually be filled with love for them. I'm not quite there yet but I will be and hopefully you as well. I'm still doing the \"I forgive you\" thing and I know it happens frequently when I'm in physical pain. Glad to see more and more people having break throughs here!\n\nWho wrote the book? üìñ\n\nCaroline Myss. I listened to it on audible.\n\nGreat post... at the end of it, it's so simple. We overcomplicate it because of our resistance to actually forgiving.\n\nHi op, i am in similar position as you, but how were you just able to ‚Äúforgive‚Äù? Was there a process and what did you learn from it? \n\nBefore reading this book, you never tried ‚Äúforgiving‚Äù? What changed?\n\nI just started to think of it differently. I've also been very sick for the last year and have been in quite the dark night of the soul. While I don't think anger is what's causing it, it's definately a component. So my life may really depend on it. I also spent three hours praying during the eclipse and have been having some momentous shifts in my life.\n\nIf I were to describe the process of the forgiveness I've found, it's first understanding what forgiveness is and then remembering to forgive in every moment of anger. I guess the remembrance and actually saying \"I forgive you\" has been the biggest change for me since when I'm angry forgiving is the last thing I want to do and most of the time I don't even realize I can just forgive.\n\nI can relate to you. I lost most of my vision in the last 9 months(July 13,2023) I am legally blind, however I can see some. I can read, do most normal things. I can not drive, but that may be better for society. Oh, humor is super important for me. Congrats and I wish u well on ur life journey.\n\nCongratulations! Forgiveness is an integral part of soul growth.For me, learning to forgive myself has been one of the hardest and most rewarding experiences. Thru self-forgiveness, I have learned self- love and it has enriched my spiritual health exponentially.\n\n\"Forgiveness is not forgetting.\nForgiveness is not a free pass.\nForgiveness is about letting go.\"\nIsn't that beautiful? I heard this on Evil Lives Here on ID.\n\nIt took me a long time to realize forgiving someone is something you do for yourself, not so much for them. And you need to forgive yourself, too. It actually helps to say it to yourself.\n\nI hold on to my anger and hate. It keeps me warm.\nThere are just some people that I will never ever forgive and that's ok. I'm used to it now.\n\nThe journey towards self-discovery and authentic living can be profoundly transformative, as you have experienced. Your willingness to confront the anger and resentment that had taken root within you is commendable. The path of forgiveness, as you have discovered, is a powerful one that can truly liberate us from the burdens of the past.\n\nThe insights you gained from the book \"Why People Don't Heal\" resonate deeply with the holistic approach espoused by Relife's coaching. By recognizing that the \"roles\" we play in life are not the entirety of who we are, but rather masks that can conceal our true, authentic self - our \"human soul\" - you have taken a profound step towards self-awareness and healing.\n\nThe simple yet profound practice of saying \"I forgive you\" whenever the anger resurfaces is a testament to the transformative power of mindfulness and presence. It is a practice that aligns with Relife's emphasis on using tools like meditation, breathing techniques, and energetic treatments to quiet the mind and create space for what truly matters.\n\nYour story is a testament to the possibility of breaking free from the \"vicious circles\" of our conditioned patterns and embracing a more conscious, authentic way of being. By learning to love yourself unconditionally, you have tapped into a wellspring of energy and joy that can ripple out to touch the lives of those around you.\n\nConfronting deep-seated anger and resentment is a profound journey of self-discovery. Your willingness to face these emotions is commendable. \n\nRecognizing that the \"roles\" we play in life are not our true, authentic self - our \"human soul\" - was a pivotal insight. \n\nThe simple practice of saying \"I forgive you\" demonstrates the power of mindfulness and presence. This aligns with using tools like meditation to quiet the mind.\n\nYour story is a shining example of breaking free from conditioned patterns and embracing authentic living. By learning self-love, you've tapped into a wellspring of energy and joy.\n\nSharing your experience is a gift. I encourage you to continue exploring the depths of your \"human soul\" and life's purpose. This journey can be profoundly transformative.\n\nThanks, OP. That‚Äôs wonderful you chose to release and continue to release anger towards self and others. I have learned that, so long as I become aware anger exists within me, I can make the decision to forgive and ask my higher self/higher power/spiritual supports to help me to forgive. I don‚Äôt have to know how or even feel I have the ability, but over the coming days and weeks the process of forgiveness will occur. For smaller things, I can simply speak forgiveness as you do and release it. Other times, I need to look under the anger to identify and feel the feelings which created the anger before being ready to forgive.\n\nWhenever the topic of forgiveness comes up, I like to share this clip by Nadia Bolz-Weber.\n\nForgiveness is for YOU. It is how you disconnect yourself from the people that have caused you harm.\n\n[https://youtu.be/VhmRkUtPra8?si=uj-25ge4K99O1iuS](https://youtu.be/VhmRkUtPra8?si=uj-25ge4K99O1iuS)\n\nAnger should not be controlled it should channelized.\n\nGoing to try this OP. I haven't forgiven those who have hurt and wronged me, I don't actually think I know how to..."
