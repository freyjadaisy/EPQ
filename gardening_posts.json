    "all_comment_text": "Um are we just going to ignore the fact that you're a disney princess\n\nLol hiding in plain sight 😂\n\n🎵Let it grow! Let it grow!🎵\n\nWait that’s the Lorax 👀\n\nthis up here is the comment that I visit this sub for\n\nHow do you grow chipmunks?!\n\nI was just going to ask the same thing! So cute. And such a beautiful harvest.\n\nIt's not hiding if it's legal\n\nOkay but really… just creeped your posts &amp; what you’ve done to get your garden where it is, is amazing!!! Definitely inspired 🌱\n\nBest comment ever!\n\n[removed]\n\nLove those purple/black bell peppers!\n\nThank you first year growing them ! Went there started to grow I though something was wrong with them because it started green before the black came in 😂, then I realized, and it’s called purple beauty this variety I grew\n\nI grew them for the first time this year too! I only got 2-3 at first, now I have 6 on there at the same time.\n\n\nYour harvest is beautiful *wipes tear*\n\nThat’s cool question tho did u top them ? I notice the ones I topped grew a bunch of sweet peppers, and the ones that grew naturally only had a few and thank you friend !\n\n Not sure what top means? lol I probably should by now. \n\nThose first pepps I got were almost a month ago. I thought the plant was toast. Then we had a couple rainy days in a row over a few weeks and everything exploded in my garden. \n\nIt was my first year doing grow bags so it’s been quite the adventure.\n\nWhen your season is over, prune your pepper down to just above the first node above the first fork and then move your grow bag to somewhere cool but out of the weather like a garage. Keep it moist-ish and then put it back outside once it gets warm again. Most of the time your second and third season will produce a bunch. You can do this with any pepper plant. I have a couple 6 year old chilis that I keep in my kitchen window year round. You can also bonsai them once they start getting woody around the bottom after year one.\n\nThis comment is gold ! This will be my first year trying to do that ! Since I gre scotch bonnet this year for the first time I wanna , try and save them\n\nAlso, check out r/bonchi! They have a lot of cool info on growing compact plants that are heavy producers and they're a super helpful community for growing my \"Window Peppers\"\n\nOhhhhhh thank you! \n\nI don’t have a garage unfortunately so it’s either outside or bust.\n\nTopping is just snipping the main stem of the plant so it starts to branch out more , and I wouldn’t suggest it this late I’m the season, I normally do it once the develop there leaves and about couple inches tall\n\nI noticed those too and they’re gorgeous.  What do they taste like?\n\nI find there really good, and taste is very strong it has a slight onion taste\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ovqspxc5dimd1.jpeg?width=1024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1b4ad36bc58e692f54cb233ad7d2ab18070d8b34\n\nI pray hard for a lot of it, and keep working by the grace of god in time friend ❤️ sending blessing your way\n\nHope you didn’t harvest the chipmunk! 😛\n\nLol no that’s my friend I have 4 of them living here\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4noes7cbthmd1.jpeg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ab7d1043f95b63e7c28780219274b630d05fe32\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aaoqh71q1mmd1.jpeg?width=3653&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bb87620fe870d3f754a697186fe53fa8fffefc7c\n\nThey even came by for the big reveal this year ❤️\n\nOkay this may just be the cutest pregnancy announcement I’ve ever seen!! It’s giving Snow White vibes! \n\nCongratulations!! 💜\n\nCongratulations!!!\n\nOne time my dog chased a chipmunk into my house! 😳\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5xp93ml4dimd1.jpeg?width=3646&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a17b6ac40f7ae046b5254f3ef1889f17c0af7f09\n\nRocky wasn’t happy that I let it go. lol!\n\nThankfully it ran into the one room in my house that was the easiest to capture it.\n\nI’m happy to report it’s back with its family and I’m sure he learned his lesson. 🤣\n\nMine chased a pregnant mouse inside one day! We had mice in the house for a few months before we fianlly got rid of them 😂😂\n\nOh geez.\n\nI had sort of a similar problem. Before I got my boy Rocky, I had gotten Sepsis-Shock and was in the hospital for almost 6 months! One of my Drs said during my 10 days in the E.R. I had died twice! (Actually during the 6 months I was in 2 different hospitals, and then a skilled nursing home.)\n\nBut I digress…\n\nI was living alone, so when I got home I discovered I had a mouse. So I set some traps and got it overnight. Done. (Or so I thought!)\n\nAnyway long story short, that one mouse actually turned out to be 10 mice!\n\nBelieve it or not, it took me less than a week to get them all. (Sorry, but when it comes to mice I’m not a catch and release guy. They’ll just wind up finding their way back.)\n\nSo here’s my sure-fire way to get them quickly…(well, 99.9% sure-fire. Further down you’ll understand why I say that.lol!)\n\nWhat I do is I set up 3 good ‘ol “nothing special” type mousetraps -side by side. Thats crucial, they have to be set up side-by-side. I put just a little bit of either cheese or peanut butter on the triggers. (And just a smidge pressed across the spring so if they’re feeling especially greedy they literally have to walk on trap to get to it.\n\nI found that if a mouse is clever enough to take the bait without setting off the first trap, it usually gets them on the second one BUT if they  manage to take the second traps bait with no issue, they get zonked by the third one.\n\nOne of those days, I actually got a “2-fer!”\n\nI’ve only had one get by the third trap. But I managed to get him the following day.\n\nA few tips to this. Most of the time a mouse will follow a wall, so put the traps with the triggers facing the wall.\n\nIn my case they were coming from under my dishwasher so I blocked off the bottom of the dishwasher except for a small portion of it so the mice would need to get past the traps in order to get into the room.\n\nBefore I figured out where they were coming from, I had found some mouse duds on my countertop (yuck!) my kitchen is clean, but it must’ve been doing recon for some food, so what I did was make a channel out of cardboard so the mouse would need to go through the channel to get to the countertop and waiting for it was you guessed it-3 mousetraps. lol.\n\nOut of all of ‘em, only one of the mice was a pain in the butt,  so what I did was I adjusted the triggers to make them into “hair triggers” I did this by taking a needle nose plier and carefully, and ever so slightly, bending the piece that the wire (that holds the back the part that snaps closed) barely held it.\n\nIt was so sensitive that If I breathed too heavily on it, it would set it off! Lol. So that’s how I finally got the bugger.\n\nMy big mean looking chipmunk chaser turned out to be a real mush pot, because every time I got one, he go near it and whine. lol.\n\nHere’s what Rocky is usually like…\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rgk2ft0xzjmd1.jpeg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2cddfd0a0a33202908f6c045bd796e7acfc58aac\n\n(That Christmas one of the things I got him was a stuffed chipmunk dog toy. Lol!)\n\nGlad you’re still with us!\n\nThank you! 😀\n\nIt was a hard uphill battle which left me disabled but better that then the other option! 😉👍\n\nThat Pic is great!\n\nOMG this is the cutest fkg thing 😭🤩\n\nOmg!! I need to know more! I’m also Canada zone 3b, but in Saskatchewan.\n\nThank you!!! 🐹 I call our chipmunks, Hoppers!! 😅🧡\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hrgyf1j8xhmd1.jpeg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=500729b0ee96700f8bfad7083f037fa8f7c07678\n\nThat’s two of them of the 4 I think the mom didn’t make it this year she lived here for over 5 years\n\nI am SO JEALOUS! I want chipmunk friends. You're a true Disney princess.\n\nIt took time it took 3 months to friend the first one but after that, they become really use to u! And even the birds come to visit\n\nAhhhh that’s amazing. Thanks for sharing &lt;3\n\nWord gets around about the friendly human.\n\nThis is so lovely.\n\nThey’re missing the part where this is just normal Jamaican men behavior 😂\n\nLol 😂 you already know\n\nThose chipmunks are fantastic. A friend to wildlife is a friend to me.\n\nIt took me a minute to figure out your comment. (I’m like, where’s this chippie!?) 🤣 \n\nOP is a small animal and bird whisperer! 😁\n\nFreshly picked chipmunk is all the rage this year.\n\naw I wanna be you so bad 😭\n\nIt takes time this has been the 4 year and I start normally from march indoor then finish outdoors my season ends October\n\nit’s definitely inspiring✨ many kudos to you\n\nThat makes me feel better. I’m year one of taking my own seriously and WOW! It’s no joke. But to learn, is to garden!\n\nawesome looking garden, what strains of cannabis are you growing?\n\nThank you and so far I’m growing pink Kush, Chocolope, and there’s a random strain in there that I had some seeds for.\n\n you're basically growing your munchies supplies alongside\n\nWow chocolope… I haven’t heard that strain since 2008 or something like that. Was the best smoke I ever had to this day!\n\nI love cucumbers!Slice them with tomatoes add salt and pepper and eat my share!\n\nSame here and that’s exactly how I like them too !\n\nMy cucumbers are bitter this year. Used the same seeds as last year’s and those were sweet. I thought I was harvesting them too late, but the ones I picked earlier were bitter too. Do you have any tips?\n\nWhat I’ve learned from my experience with cucumbers, if they start to get fry and go through stress phase, then it taste bitter, I have 7 cucumbers plants4 are in the ground they are super sweet, but the other 3 are a bit bitter and I have those in grow bags, but I realize they dry out way faster tends the bitter taste, try keeping a good water consistent and fish fertilizer.\n\nSo cucumbers will turn bitter if they go through a temperature fluctuation that is extreme…hot to cold, vice versa. Happened to me as well and researched it. So, timing and mother nature’s cooperation is key…\n\nCumumbers with lime and Tahin Chile spice are amazing if you want another good option\n\nThank you for the suggestion much appreciated\n\n👍NP. Congrats on the garden, looks awesome. I try to make due with my rooftop but not quite the same!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rbzkl6unnimd1.jpeg?width=1242&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=139807e45f217944bc90ac83a7bbf96d6ba7610a\n\nwow great job! can you tell me more about how you preserve the veg? I see you used vacuum bags. How long does that last?\n\nThank you friend, and the ones in the vacuum seal will be frozen, I just took out the air so it last longer and don’t get freezer burnt and the other stuff I’m jarring , and the other stuff lol I have store in a cool dark room\n\nsick man. I'll try this in the future. thank you\n\nI’ve never seen vacuum sealed cherry tomatoes. Are they mushy when thawed? Or do you cook them?\n\nIt’s my first time it but hope this helps friend\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r8i5ajuclimd1.jpeg?width=1284&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e29c7f3dfed1cf9e071074a76d9b4e7610ee9c11\n\nI'd recommend using it for cooked meals once thawed! The texture won't be quite the same as if it were fresh.\n\nI like to slow roast my cherry tomatoes and then freeze them in jars.  They're like a cheat code for pasta, just add some garlic, butter and or olive oil, herbs/chili if you have, and it's the best damn pasta sauce you could ask for.\n\nDo you have to blanch the veggies before you pack? \n\nWe tried this with corn last year, and I’m pretty sure they fermented in the bags. 😫\n\nYou, sir, have a very fine garden. Congratulations!!\n\nThank you friend 👍🏾🌱\n\nI love the chipmunk tax!   💕💕💕 May I add my Disney Princess Magic\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hrf6bmebrimd1.jpeg?width=5712&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3e7412981a0e38626343abbf3747fefaca1dc9b0\n\nto the thread?   This is my pollinator garden.  🥹🫶\n\nThat is so cool 😍 that’s a real magical moment\n\nI love Mr. Chipmunk!\n\nThere 2 males and two females that live here\n\nIf you keep feeding them, there will be a lot more than that!\n\nGreenhouse goals\n\nLivin the dream my friend! Congratulations on your achievements and hard work.\n\nThank friend much appreciation\n\nThe chipmunk taking his taxes hahaha\n\nLol taxing me harder than the government 😂\n\nLooks great! That chipmunks livin large! What variety is that bell pepper?\n\nThat chipmunk living to good, it walks right past the dogs and come right in the house now lol, they have a good life\n\nThe multi-coloured eggs look soo pretty. You must have a good variety of chickens...\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b4kseaxq6imd1.jpeg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d2dc49defed2d870009dcbda7e2833be50e0300d\n\nI do I have 8 chickens, they lay blue , green and brown eggs and I have two ducks but those ducks are male broke back mountain 😂 jokes\n\n😍\n\nChickens can lay blue eggs?? TIL…\n\nI’m so jealous! I tried to grow indigo rose tomatoes and they ended up being red!\n\nIt takes trail and error friend, my 4 year growing corn and there are so tall and skinny falling over 😂, it’s a learning process\n\nWow that garden looks amazing! Congrats!\n\nIt’s beautiful!\n\nHearty harvest, that's quite the array of peppers too. How many different types you got in there? \nAlso curious what canna cultivars you've got going there. Jealous of you and your Canadian garden / farmstead. Living the life\n\nThank you friend, and from the top\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ltybs8md5imd1.jpeg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8bdaebd183e4c7fa564b35911cbe92c7af397d15\n\nof my head I’m growing 8 varieties but my favourite is scotch bonnet pepper, this is my first year I’ve gotten that one to grow ever! And my Cana is pink Kush , Chocolope and a few random seeds I had\n\nSo cool thank you, great pic. I'm a big pepper fan but don't have a yard to grow outdoors, do you have any suggestions for easier to grow pepper varieties that are okay with being grown indoors in a tent?\n\nI understand what u mean friend, and I’ve never fully finish my peppers in a tent, but I would say go for the variety that grow smaller peppers, I think that would be your best option, I had peppers in my grow tent and banana peppers where the first to start for in in there\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qqhgjsykjimd1.jpeg?width=3840&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c6795506ac10d2dd316055acfa1b45e1a0fd79b\n\nWhere did you get your greenhouse?\n\nI actually got a car port frame from a friend and wrapped it into a greenhouse with a lot of spare material\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kynhr9u3zhmd1.jpeg?width=1277&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7eec2496820a373e4b0d5d0fc795b6107053de29\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7rg26qv4zhmd1.jpeg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=93472b98dad50f8d0bb6a2104d11c266bc62ee91\n\nGreat idea!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h43311v9zhmd1.jpeg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dd74b41e8219493192d24e0e715c7dba1debd500\n\nThat’s awesome bro\n\nAwesome harvest!! 🥕🧅🌶️🍅🌽🥦🍐🍏🍎\n\nThank you 🙏\n\nI’m happy to see the chipmunks are earning their keep\n\nYe there are well taking care off , and they help out getting rid of pest\n\n👍🏻\n\nWhat strain are you growing?\n\nPink Kush, Chocolope and I had some random seeds that I don’t know the strains I just call them wild cards\n\nLooks like you’re living the dream. Keep on keeping on!\n\nOmg that weed tho! And the little chip monk!!! Living the best life.💜\n\nYe I have 10 plants going but I got my license and lol those chipmunks live the best life they could possible have.\n\nD’awww the lil chipmunk friend 😊 congrats on the bountiful harvest! I hope to one day have a greenhouse that big\n\nYe these little chipmunk adds so much joy to gardening they always come by to visit, and if anyone has a old car frame there getting rid off that’s how I made mines\n\nThat’s so great!  Looks absolutely delicious!!\n\nSweet harvest. Green thumb\n\nThank you 😊🌱👍🏾\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8o98kh3ynpmd1.jpeg?width=1170&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=979df522c025b668c7e4aadf0fdd57fd0b33066c\n\nAWW CHIPMUNK HELLO\n\nWhat do you use to seal the veggies that you harvest? And do they stay fresh for a lot longer?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qfx708ig6imd1.jpeg?width=1284&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b404f84c20d1bf7a485320c70e37b2de63e683d3\n\nHope this helps friend, it just help the Stay fresh longer.\n\nWhat brand do you use? Mine recently broke and I’m looking to purchase a new one. But so many of them on Amazon have horrible reviews.\n\nThis is the type I use\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xboii22ulimd1.jpeg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9b9d3432ee1595548da39a0b8a322ab3211ef303\n\nBeautiful!! May I ask what vacuum sealer you use? I’ve been looking for one for a while, but haven’t been able to decide.\n\nThis is the one I have it works amazing no issue u just have to cut the bags it’s super easy, or u can buy them pre cut but cut them ur self u can make different sizes\n\nI love your garden!\n\noooo what a dream!! do you freeze the vacuum sealed veggies?\n\nYou were out there walking once upon a dream with the animals 😭😭😂😂💕\n\nWalking in a dream world with my animals 😂\n\nGoals right here. I need everything!\n\nThank you for sharing - I love your photos and stories!\n\nWow u are a pro!  What's ur secret?\n\nThanks and honestly it’s just trail and error and knowing what grows easy in my area it’s my 4th year the one thing I can’t get is corn it’s a hit and miss\n\nAre you posting on any other social media? I’d love to follow your chipmunk and gardening adventures!\n\nBeautiful harvest and adorable chipmunk! You Gould post this in the greenhouse sub. People would love to see your success!\n\nThis is peak female gaze content and I'm here for it.\n\nDid you grow the chipmunk from seed?\n\nyou’re living the dream, truly.\n\nI see what you did there\n\nI LOVEEEE your chipmunk!!!!🥹😍\n\nBeautiful harvest! Your chipmunk friend is such a cutie!!\n\nNice sativa\n\nSativa I see\n\nYe I like to smoke sativa keeps me more going, Indica puts me in da couch 😂😅\n\nEverything looks so good! I was so interested in the veggies till I got distracted by the cute chipmunk 😂 I want to pet them.\n\nThank you , and lol I’m just as distracted when I see them and if there’s no food then they all keep following me around lol\n\nLet’s eat! 😉👍\n\nThat chipmunk is adorable! What a lovely harvest\n\nAwesome. 👍🏽\n\nRight on!👍\n\nmarvelous!!!\n\nGorgeous harvest!\n\nYou got a great harvest and a friend!! lol!!\n\nI think the food saver is one of the most critical pieces of gardening equipment. We've been loading our deep freeze all summer. We have everything from mulberries to squash to spinach to cabbage to tomatoes to melons and everything else stored for winter. Now we start canning things. Which is the best preservation method IMHO. When you crack a jar of tomatoes they still have that garden freshness. It's amazing.\n\nLooks like a great harvest!\n\nIf there’s an apocalypse, I’m coming to your place.\n\nI'm sitting here imagining how joyful I'd be eating all that fresh produce while enjoying some giggle basil. Happy for you!\n\nGood display of basket and yummy vegetables.  Nice pic.\n\nWow—the veggies, the chipmunks, the chocolope, the smile. Living life to the fullest. ❤️\n\nBeautiful harvest 😍 nicely done!\n\nThose are some really nice looking tomato plants in pics 5 and 7!😎\n\nYou've done a great job. Everything looks so healthy. Thank you for sharing!\n\nHow long do they keep in the vacuum bags ? Do need to do anything specific like cook them or are they stored raw . Just curious . I have raised beds but not as much as you .\n\nThis is what I call garden diversification. Edibles and edibles.\n\nYou are living the dream 🥰\n\n🤔Did you start the chipmunk from seed and plant it after the last frost? 🐿️😊😉\n\nWhere do you buy chipmunk seeds? 🤔🤔🤔\n\nIs your greenhouse heated for the winter? I'm trying to figure out the best way to heat our greenhouse this winter. I have plants I can't bring inside because I have a cat that will eat them all...haha! I love your chipmunks! I have regular squirrels and bird families visit :)\n\nAmazing! Greetings from the Netherlands\n\nCongratulations on your harvest! What’re the dimensions on that greenhouse? Been thinking about building one for next season.\n\nYou are living my dream life 😃🥹\n\nWhere did you get your chipmunk seeds?  Last time I ordered them, they were mislabeled and grew groundhogs.\n\nVacuum sealing everything as whole, and then I assume freezing? If so, how’s the texture when you defrost? I always dice all my peppers up before freezing, may have to invest in a vacuum sealer if this method is better (which it seems it is)\n\nGorgeous produce omg \nAlso, chipmunk buddy!\n\nIs this your job as well? I spend hours in my garden a day and don’t get a fraction of this\n\nNo I just do it as a hobby, but I work close by home 2 mins away that’s why I have time when I get home, and I start indoor from around march because I start to get the winter blues 😂, but most days I’m in my garden from about 4 to 9 and on the weekdends I’ll be out there some days 10-12 hours but only in the begging of the season, once everything in the ground it’s just to water from 6-10\n\nAbsolutely stunning produce sir!\n\nAww the little chippy!\n\nImpressive‼️👍🏻\n\nLiterally my dream come true\n\nWoah this is awesome\n\nI have a huge bowl full of those black krim cherry tomatoes. A storm took out my plant. I had to harvest everything. They are delicious, though my wife loves them on her salads. Great haul 👍\n\nNice haul. Good job.\n\nI love the greenhouse!\n\nAmazing harvest! I love the variety of shapes and colors in the peppers and tomatoes ❤️\n\nAmazing I can’t wait till that’s me #manifesting\n\nI love to see this!!!! 🤗🤗🤗👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽🤌🏽\n\nCongrats bro good work\n\nDo you blanch your produce or vacuum seal it totally uncooked?\n\nYou’re plants are beautiful. Do you have tips for keeping pepper plants healthy and helping them reach maturity during the cold months in zone 7a? My plants are starting to produce for the first time and are full of flowers.\n\nBeautiful\n\nHow did you befriend the chipmunk? I have been trying to bribe mine with cherry tomatoes but they won't come near me"

Banjo 🪕 squash ?!\n\nZucchino rampicante - climbing zucchini! It's a really unique squash. If you harvest it while it's green, you can use it like zucchini/summer squash. If you leave it on the vine, the skin will eventually harden into a rind and turn tan, and the insides will turn orange - like a butternut squash! All the fruits are massive and the leaves are beautiful, highly recommended.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qxiqrtjqltud1.jpeg?width=1960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5d17233d600eeebffb3c2c5df2763be348232ef1\n\nthis is exactly what I wanted. NAILED IT\n\nThis man has figured out angles already I see…\n\nWife and I have been doing these kind of pics for a while. No matter how many times, it always makes me laugh.\n\nWhoa!!! That’s amazing!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pvqhensqltud1.jpeg?width=2510&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8614456924c63bc7fbf66c46314eaa81b3172fad\n\nWow where is this!\n\nThese people are NOT gonna give up their secret gardening spots !\n\nFor real though don't ask where I caught that fish lol\n\nUploaded the photo into GeoSpy and it came up Pemberton, British Columbia, Canada.\n\nEdit: Can confirm that it is Pemberton\n\nOmg I want to know too!!\n\nIf nothing else, that is some IMPRESSIVE grip strength to hold that absolute unit of a squash(?) with one hand.\n\nlol thank you! It is a candy roaster squash. Tbh I had to brace it and then tell my partner to tell me right before he took the photo haha\n\nShhhhhhh, you raw strengthed that! I believe in you!\n\n[removed]\n\nSpot on! 10.6lbs.\n\nLooks Iike a jumbo pink banana squash\n\nI think that's another name for the candy roaster. So you are correct. I think.\n\n[removed]\n\nShhh… the lesbians will start crying. Myself included 🥺\n\nSo I don't wanna sound like a hater here, but don't they get tough and seedy at that size? I'm not familiar with the variety.\n\nI’m not either! I hope it will be tasty. Going to cut it tonight for dinner. Can report back!\n\nNot familiar with that cultivar, but the name makes me think its a winter squash (like butternut or pumpkins) which you want to get full sized before harvesting.\n\nPS: just googled the name and it is a winter squash.\n\nSquash is amazing and never too large to use. Scoop out the seeds, salt and roast them. Peel off the skin and feed it to the chickens or compost it. You can of course, dice, marinate, and roast the flesh, but you can also puree it all and use it instead of water in a pancake recipe. 🤤\n\nWinter squash are more like melons in that you want them fully ripe for the best flavor and texture, which is the exact opposite of summer squash which you want to pick young and tender.\n\nWinter squash are allowed to get completely ripe so that they’ll harden off and store well. In their case, it’s the variety that determines whether they will be fibrous or not, not the maturity. But some squash like zucchini are eaten while immature, and if allowed to mature they will be good for nothing but seed. That said, you can eat almost any squash in its immature state as well; It’s just that most people want to let winter squash mature.\n\nThey're wearing a climbing gym shirt. Lines up.\n\nmy partner says that this is “stolen climbing valor” as he is the climber lol.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wikaklmtltud1.jpeg?width=2252&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fe68a87d831478e8ce7b266bee39cb83d331c7ab\n\nThat smile!\n\nYou’re too cute for ugly Reddit!\n\nCouple of fine homewreckers\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qfzvqx1lruud1.jpeg?width=1576&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e8e9c1482a2b49a8c75e1859a5d137aaf6023feb\n\nOn the way to the county fair 😁 Third place!\n\ncongrats!! 👏 That’s amazing!!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xeinf2o5xtud1.jpeg?width=2448&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb373131a982245e6584be420bd89300eda67fcf\n\nIs it Cabbage?

Also hats off on the squash. That is quite the unit !\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/92ivhakygsud1.jpeg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d5514d84d62641f2ff54655fe546043096b40ccf\n\nHere’s one from earlier in the season. 5, 6ft tables full of naturally grown produce\n\nYour elastic table cloths give a really nice look.\n\nThank you! I found them on amazon and they have worked well for a few seasons now. As you can see I need more than 4 lol. But end of the market week you just toss them in the laundry and come out clean again. Works great\n\nI'll keep this in the back of the mind. Hoping to do a market farm myself, but focused on meat by the cut.\n\nWhen I was in college I used to raise a few calf’s to almost finishing weight during the summers just to help pay for a class or some books possibly. But when I launched the vegetable farm I quickly realized that the animal market is entirely a different game. I often get asked by my customers why I don’t grow and sell flowers, but currently with 2 acres of vegetable production even that in itself to make money off flowers is another ball game. I’ve been to flower farms, and truly a beautiful experience their layout and cost of operation is totally different than mine. As you can add, meat is probably the same way. Now if I could clone myself to run multiple farms I sure would love to try them all 😂 but doing a little bit of everything in today’s world is difficult. You can do it. But to make money, and support yourself, now that’s the big question\n\nMillion dollar question. And yep I want to do it all too haha. I love to garden and would love to run a nursery and love to raise bees and honey and love to expand my orchard and....well I do too much haha.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/82lhsaj7hzud1.jpeg?width=1169&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=63300e505878222dd35f0b7836f2617453dbef47\n\nThese weren’t ready for me to hold up at the time… but guessing about 3lbs of dried goods EACH!

Take pride in your hard work and share your beautiful vegetables!\n\nOhhhhh candy roaster I really wanna try them. Also yes post your harvests like fish catches!\n\nLmao! Love it.\n\nThis is a terrific idea. Maybe the sub could have a yearly contest.\n\nAs a fisher I love this 😍\n\nDope ! This is normal size for this type of squash. I made a super good soup with it. It held up in the pantry for about 5 months solid and tasted akin to butternut squash. Very very delicious\n\nI would swipe right on any profile I saw with this. Could be a billion red flags in the rest of the profile, but posing with a giant vegetable? Hot damn.\n\nIf men posed with the veggies they grew in their gardens instead of the fish they caught on the annual deep sea fishing trip with the boys, they’d get more matches. It’s science.\n\nThat is a gourd-ing habit.\n\nhot"

It's not generally instant tho. Usually it takes 1 to a few years for the mother plant to fully die off and during that time they usually push out a few pups. I'm not familiar with this particular brom but I'd be shocked if it didn't do the same\n\nYes. I have 3 bromeliads and they have all had pups.\n\nYes, but most bromeliads form both pups AND seeds at the time of flowering. Pineapples, for example, produce between 3 and 5 pups when the flowering starts, though can rarely produce less than 3 or up to 10.\n\nNeedless to say, the pups themselves don't die when the mother plant does. You can seperate and propagate the pups and they will soon flower and pup themselves.\n\nUsually in addition to seeds there will be pups off the mother plant as well.\n\nYep! Lots of plants do.\n\nMuch prettier than me.\n\nPlants are certainly more beautiful than anyone alive lol\n\nUs, my friend. It’s much prettier than us.\n\nBut darling your gorgeous!\n\ncan these be grown as houseplants like other bromeliads?\n\nIf you had the space you could, but they get really big\n\nup to 4.5 meters. sapphire tower looks gorgeous from afar.\n\nI doubt you could get it to flower indoors\n\n[Full plant.](https://imgur.com/a/COfbUbM)\n\nOP needs to upload his/her picture to wikipedia - it looks much more impressive!\n\nExactly my thoughts!!\n\nThank you!\n\nYou’re just going to post a plant I’ve *never seen before* and not even tell us what this gorgeous plant is? 😭\n\nA puya 😻\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1ludlhzn3s3e1.jpeg?width=1536&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=850852a240636a2c0b6e079264354a6b584db9bb\n\nHi everyone, as some of the comments have stated this is a Sapphire tower or Puya. It's been growing in the corner of the garden here for many years with no special treatment. The location is lower north island in New Zealand. It has quite a few pups growing so more flowers to come eventually 🙂\n\nlooks like a giant bud\n\nI’d smoke that.\n\nYou have a lovely garden 🥹❤️😍\n\nCan we see the rest of your plants too? 😁\n\nThanks for sharing! I’ve never seen this flower before\n\nWhat is it?  It's amazing.   I have never seen a flower that color!\n\n[removed]\n\nSame! It's a beautiful color that I didn't think really existed in nature\n\nThis looks like something out of avatar 😲\n\nIt's a Puya Alpestris, quite lovely.\n\nThank you for sharing these photos! I had no idea this plant exists.  Very unusual and eye catching.  Was it hard to care for over the many years before it bloomed and which planting zone does this one live in?\n\nNo special care over the years, the location is lower north island in New Zealand. We get frosts but no snow, it doesn't even get morning sun but gets a lot of afternoon sun.\n\nPuya alpestris comes from the Andes, specifically southern Andes, which means cold dry winters, kinda warm moist springs, hot and dry summers, very windy autumns. So basically it will survive anything\n\nSuch unique colors and growth! What a cool plant, thanks for sharing\n\nThat’s such a cool color!\n\nUnreal. Worth the wait\n\nThat is the most exquisite thing I have ever seen!!! Oh my goodness! Thank you for sharing.\n\nIs that its real color? If so, that’s very unique.\n\nYup, no camera tricks 🙂\n\nThank you for sharing!!! Wow I can’t believe I am a human being witnessing this beauty of nature\n\nSometimes flowers hit like that don’t they 🥹❤️\n\nThey have these in the San Diego Botanical Garden and I thought my eyes were fooling me when I first saw the blooms! This color is so captivating and so rare in nature. Absolute beaut.\n\nThat plant is amazing! Thanks for sharing.\n\nThat’s the coolest plant ever! Wow!\n\nInsanely beautiful!! Congrats on the hard work. To wake up to such amazing natural art everyday would be so great.\n\nHoly smokes!! That is gorgeous, I need that in my life.\n\nThis is so surreal. What do you call it?\n\nGeorge We shall name it George!😄\n\nSeen one of these in person, but nowhere near that size. Great job\n\nWorth the wait.  Teal flowers?\n\nYup teal flowers, no camera tricks 🙂\n\nThis plant looks fictional.\n\nWTF? What is it?\n\n✨️VERY RARE✨️\n\nomg this is beautiful, which plant is this and how did you grow it?\n\nAmazing Bromeliad, I'm seldom surprised but this specimen is insanely beautiful. Thanks for sharing.\n\n\n*\nHey, I'm from Chile, where they're native from, just wanted to share a Pic of it in the wild from 2 weeks ago :) (I work in consultancy). We also have yellow and purple ones, I have a few in my garden but none so far has bloomed so I'm a bit jealous!.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s8lsa3ordw3e1.jpeg?width=3000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a7e1dec8459d7a7292c320d005f62f36f7a6d42d\n\nWhat is the Dr Seuss is that?\n\nObsessed!  What a beautiful plant! \n\nFound what it was here: https://www.smgrowers.com/products/plants/plantdisplay.asp?plant_id=1328\n\nHow gorgeous!\n\nAMAZING!!! 😍\n\nIncredible. Thanks for posting!\n\nThank you so much for sharing this bromeliad. \n\nI had zero idea that it existed. 🤩\n\nWow, that’s so cool! I thought at first you had decorated it for Christmas with garland haha\n\nStunning!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! \nI love the shape and the colour and everything about it! The colour is surreal!! Like a insta filter\n\nIt looks like the plant says “I’m not like other plants” and it is not wrong\n\nThat is such a beautiful color!\n\nI thought it was a Christmas tree that’s just a bit different lol\n\nSo *damn* beautiful 😍❤️\n\nWow that’s really cool\n\nWOW👀😲\n\nOP for real! You need to give us more details!!\n\nPut a few details in the comments and made a reply with a picture to show where it's planted 🙂\n\nLooks beautiful.   \nThis is my first time seeing this kind of flowers.\n\nWow, I have no idea what that is, but it's gorgeous. 💕💜🩵\n\nWhere is it growing? Absolutely beautiful. Thank you.\n\nLower north island in New Zealand. We get frosts here but no snow. Planted on the south west side of the house so only gets afternoon sun.\n\nMy grandmother would love that. in her ny doorway she had a large bromeliad we decorated for christmas. it got to be 10 feet tall and flowered rarely. It was her pride and joy and she made me the gardener I am today!\n\n(she also somehow dragged it in and out of the house every season, and it started out as a little short thing...)\n\nWhatever the opposite of \"jump scare\" is, to indicate a good photo that stopped your mid scroll.. this is it. Bravo 👏\n\nIt has those stalks near the flowers so birds can perch and feed on the flowers. Also if you want to see another impressive species in this genius look up puta raimondii which is the largest of the species.\n\nWow! What is this?\n\nExquisite!!!\n\nWhat type of plant is it, stunning!\n\nHoly moly.. GORGEOUS!! Where do you live for this Beauty to survive outside??\n\nLower north island in New Zealand. We get frosts here but no snow. Planted on the south east side of the house so only gets afternoon sun.\n\nOh my goodness I truly appreciate you for taking the time to write this helpful information.   Happy Holidays 🙌🏼🙌🏼\n\nThey are used to rough weather because they are from The Andes, we have like 7 kinds of them just in Chile and the others are in Argentina 💕\n\nThank you for sharing this information. I will try to find one in my area, Hopefully it survives in the climate of high 90’s temperatures in the summer and low 30’s temperatures in the winter.\n\nIt will!\n\nThey look like baby bird mouths.\n\nBeautiful! I love the colors\n\nI’ve never seen anything like it. Truly amazing\n\nThe corpse flower smells better than morning breath lol\n\nAmazing!\n\nWhat a beautiful shade!\n\nUnreal\n\nCoolest plant/flowers!\n\nI need to have this, like right now. What a gorgeous plant!\n\nThis is beautiful 🥹\n\nAbsolutely beautiful! That colour is deep.\n\nBeautiful garden\n\nWow! 😍😍😍Thanks for sharing.\n\nDo the flowers have a smell?? They look so beautiful\n\nThis is such a stunning, and unique plant! Thank you for sharing\n\nStill bummed that a past client didn't want to go with these. We found some Puya alpestris for sale locally, but they thought it looked strange.\n\nWell duh, that's why we wanted to plant it!\n\nThat is GORGEOUS! I have never seen one of these plants. Amazing!\n\nJust reminds us how stunningly beautiful the world is. Thanks for sharing\n\nHoly I thought it was AI. Epic !\n\nwtf is that.. it’s beautiful\n\nStunning. Thank you for sharing\n\nAmazing bud\n\nGreat job! I’ve never seen anything like this before\n\nWhoa!\n\nWow that’s beautiful!\n\nso so so beautiful 😭😭😭😭\n\nGlorious\n\nSTUNNING\n\nThat is just WOW!\n\nNever seen anything like it. Very special indeed!😃👍\n\nNow this looks fake. I know it's real, but still! It's so beautiful and odd.\n\nJust wow❤️❤️❤️\n\nI am *floored* by this absolute stunner!! That is such a unique, pastel like blue flower! Super jealous!\n\nFascinating!\n\nSecond time I’ve seen this plant on Reddit in a few days. Beautiful.\n\nOh my gosh this is beautiful!  I need this in my life! 😍\n\nSo beautiful thanks for sharing!\n\nyou won.\n\nThat is extraordinary, thank you for sharing it\n\nWow\n\nWow\n\nGonna have to hunt one down for my prehistoric bed.\n\nBeautiful! Thank you for sharing photos!\n\nThat is unbelievably gorgeous 😍\n\nNow that is a plant that looks like you asked AI to generate a flower on an alien world (yes I know it's real).\n\nThe beautiful teal color of the flowers is stunning! You’re lucky to have this plant in your yard!\n\nWhat climate are you in\n\nBeautiful!\n\nWooooowww\n\nthis is so pretty , i’ve never seen this before &amp; i thought it was cannabis 🥴🥴😍😍\n\nWow!! It’s absolutely beautiful!\n\nThat is so stunning. Never seen anything like that before!!\n\nThe way I'd never shut up about this! Congratulations 👏\n\nBeautiful 😍 I’ve never seen that color in a flower before.\n\nIt looks like a biblically accurate depiction of an angel!\n\nWow! Impressive!\n\nI want one\n\nWow, stunning!\n\nWow, that was unexpected. Very cool!\n\nThat’s fucking cool.\n\nJust Amazingly Beautiful!!!!!\n\nWow beautiful!!\n\nDoes it survive winter?\n\nUnique colors\n\nThat is one of the most stunning things I’ve ever seen .\n\nIncredible. Do you live somewhere warm?\n\nIt's reasonably warm here, only getting up to 30°c in the summer. In the winter time we get frosts and go a little below 0°c sometimes but we don't get snow.\n\nI've never seen this plant, but thank you, it's amazing.\n\nWhat in the Dr Seuss is this magnificent bastard\n\nThat is one of the most gorgeous plants I have ever seen!\n\nWow! A new pleasure! Thanks!\n\nJust WOW!\n\nWow!\n\nBeautiful flowers! What an amazing colour!\n\nStunning!\n\nSo cool wow\n\nThat's so gorgeous!!!\n\nBeautiful 🤩\n\nIdk what this plant is but it’s so beautiful. 😍\n\nThat is amazing\n\nAt first I thought it was a vine growing up a plant. Absolutely beautiful. Thank you for sharing 😍\n\n😍\n\nCool flower colors\n\nthis does not belong to earth, it's an alien plant. They only grow to connect with a space ship.\n\nAmazing\n\nWoW, those are some beautiful flowers. Love that color a lot.\n\nIncredible!\n\nThank you! It’s so gorgeous!\n\nThis is jaw droppingly beautiful\n\nI love this! \nI was scrolling and thought this was some super cute Christmas tree that was a little peculiar 😂 \nBut then I looked and am pretty astonished. It’s gorgeous!\n\nwow! so beautiful\n\nWoW. .....Thanks for posting\n\nHow wonderful! I have never seen anything like that."

    "all_comment_text": "That is magical! Thank you for sharing this beauty 💖\n\nAww thank you :) Feeling very encouraged by all the feedback everyone provided!\n\nIt’s funny that just yesterday I was feeling like everything in the garden was looking ugly. Strange how our eyes/mind play tricks on us sometimes.\n\nIt is indeed a beautiful garden. Your hard work has rewarded you immensely!\n\nYou're right, it's lovely.\n\nPost more pictures of it at night, OP! The first picture looked like a fairytale ❤️. You should be very proud. It is incredible.\n\nAGREED!!!\n\nThis is my dream. Are the temperatures pretty stable where you live? Things used to grow well where I live but the last few years have been very hot and it's stressing the plants.\n\nTemps have been hot and dry here lately. I setup a drip system to most of the beds to keep things watered. Some plants were def stressed over the summer, even with the drip system.\n\nWe too have a drip system now. Hopefully that will help. Unfortunately the sun does a lot of damage too.\n\nCan I come live in your garden?\n\nSame! I will gladly tend to the fairies 🧚\n\nNice work! It is beautiful. I love the calming effect of working in my garden and being surrounded by its beauty. \n\nCongratulations, OP! What a beautiful payoff for your labor of love.\n\nI looooooooveeeee the uplighting. Did you use solar or DC wired units?\n\nCombination of both! But mostly wired.\n\nThis is a life goal for me. Your garden is magical.\n\nThat's really impressive for just 4 years...\n\nStunning! You definitely have a green thumb.\n\nDo not let the pics fool you!! I’ve killed many a plant over the years. Especially when I start seeds (i can hear the cries of the hundreds of foxglove seedlings sitting in my compost)\n\nHahaha of course!! \nEvery great garden is proof of many failures and triumph's!! \n\nYou deserve a gold medal friend! \nI have a tropical garden, and everyone loves it but all I see if the few wins I've had. They don't know about all the losses lol.\n\nCan I ask how much you think this may have cost you, just in terms of buying plants? I wish I could just invest a bunch of money and really plan things out but get overwhelmed by the cost. I’d love to have a garden like yours- it’s enchanting.\n\nBuy end of the season perennials! \n\nNow is the time to get out there and get all the great deals. Gardening is all about the long game. Today’s sad fall plant will be next spring’s pollinator paradise!\n\nOk I will!\n\nI agree with you. This is best time to buy.\n\nWill they have a good enough chance to root before frost and then return next year?? I thought about doing this. But don’t want it to be a waste. I think I’m some 6 in terms of temp.\n\nWhat I do around this time is head off to the garden center.  Everything is 60% to 70% off. Things like hostas will do great.  Most perennials at a good garden center now aren’t dying; they are probably going dormant. It’s a little bit of a gamble, but I find it pays off more than not. \n\nThe best part of fall bargain hunting is in a couple of weeks, all the trees will be discounted. Last year I got a $600 weeping pine for $150. I saved so much, I paid to have them install and mulch it. \n\nIt’s a great time of the year for gardening. \n\nZone 6a checking in, formerly 5b.\n\nOf course you can ask! More than half my costs are from hardscaping. When I moved into this place it was just sod and a few deer chomped arborvitae. I placed all the block myself and had a stepped paver patio built (I live on a hill).\n\nEvery season I’ve spent probably close to 1.5-2k on plant material alone (perennials, annuals, trees, soil). But keep in mind I started these beds from nothing. I’ve spent less each season now that the garden is filling out on its own. And now I’m at a point where I’ve been giving away plants to friends as I rearrange everything.\n\nIt really is incredible- but I’m glad you said 1.5-2k- I think I need to bite the bullet and do the same. But also clearly you’re a very talented gardener!\n\nYour garden is so inspiring! Absolutely beautiful. 👏🏼🤩\n\nThis could be in a fairy movie.\n\nBeautiful garden!  Where are you that your liatris is still blooming?  Mine was done at least a month ago\n\nThese pics were from about a month ago! Just got around to posting. Located in Pittsburgh, zone 6B\n\nMagical. Stuff of legends tbh\n\nwow. saving this for inspiration.\n\nJust stunning! Is the lighting wired or solar? The birdbath ceramic? Lovely use of height, texture, and color.\n\nI am also interested in knowing about the birdbath! It’s gorgeous\n\nGoals\n\nSo dreamy\n\nr/hotdudeswithplants 🙂\n\nWell done. It's beautiful.\n\nYou're clearly past the terrible twos.\n\nbeautiful!! \n\nGrower and garden!!\n\nThis is stunning! Please post more pics and any advice! I have nothing my garden and would love to know how to get this vibe!\n\nWow! So beautiful!!\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/ns44czixzlqd1.gif\n\nThis is amazing. Thank you for sharing.\n\nThat looks like an incredibly happy Garden 🐛\n\nAbsolutely gorgeous garden I would love to tend to a place like that talk about revitalizing your energy and calming yourself\n\nThis is so beautiful! Did you have any professional help or do this all your own??? Where are you located? \n\nMy backyard is covered in cement, but my boyfriend just gifted me a cement saw so....it's gonna go. I'm so inspired by your yard! I love that arch sooooo much!\n\nIf anyone knows how to plan a yard for gardening AND have fun stuff for rascally puppies, let me know.\n\nMy garden is 4 yrs old this year too! But it doesn’t look like that!!!! (Mines looks not as great)\n\nThis is very inspirational! I've been looking for ideas on how to transform some of my yard. Saving this for sure.\n\nHow incredible. A place for fairies\n\nWhat a dreamy garden! Thank you for sharing, so gorgeous!\n\nWell done. You have created such a beautiful and serene oasis. Thank you for sharing all of your hard work.\n\nOhhhh my god this is a magical paradise.

Very excited to see it bloom for the first time.\n\nI can’t wait to be here! It’s beautiful\n\nWow\n\nWOW. This is my dream. May I ask if you installed solar lights, and if so, where you got them from?\n\nTell me about your plants. I love everything you’ve done\n\nStunning! 🤩\n\nOh my gosh, it's beautiful! You did an amazing job\n\nI’m hella jelly\n\nGarden of Eden got nothing on your work.

Is that just because of the time of day or do you find these flowers don’t need as long of direct sun as the growing guides say?\n\nCottage core sub would LOVE this\n\nBeautiful!\n\nSo beautiful!

    "all_comment_text": "Pollinator’s paradise!\n\nWe keep living most our lives living in the pollen paradise.\n\nPollen and the honey, honey and the pollen. Flower after flower, hour after hour. All of them are buzzin’, but half of them ain’t looking. It’s going on in the garden, but I don’t know what’s growing.\n\nBravo 👏🏻\n\nThis comment isn't being upvoted enough!! 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽\n\nThe place must be buzzing during summer.\n\nThanks for sharing this pic. \n\nDoes anyone know what the white and pink (or purple) flowers are?\n\nLooks like Phlox paniculata (garden phlox) to me. Beautiful!\n\nI need more phlox in my life\n\nI generally give no Phlox in life, but for you, I would give a phlox.\n\nPhloxing thank you!  Someone gets it!\n\nThey smell super nice too! Not overly fragrant though.\n\nThank you so much!!\n\nIs that Sweet William? Seems too late in the summer for phlox, but maybe that’s just where I live.\n\nI'm guessing zone 4 or 5, I'm in mn and I have all those same flowers blooming right now. \n\nI do, too. They are perennial, as are much of the garden. They have a light sweet odor I love, too.\n\nLucky! Phlox is only able to bloom in the spring here.\n\nI was wondering this too and thinking they are four o’clocks.\n\nA dream garden.\n\nTruly. 1. I wish we all had gardens. 2. I wish we all had gardens like this.\n\nFor me and my local wildlife… looks like a deer buffet!\n\nIt looks like a huge water bill to me! Planting local natives this fall though.\n\nAnd some cannas. They will overwinter here.\n\nNatives won't need supplemental water unless you experience a drought that's unusual for your area - another great reason to plant more! Be sure to share pictures when you do - I can't wait to see ☺️\n\nI live in California, so we have an annual drought from May to September. But I agree.\n\nI probably will wait till next year to do it right (just put in raised beds in the backyard for a fall/perennial edible garden bed, and that’s keeping me busy!). I will probably mix natives with drought tolerant plants. We have those already, but they are boring (yellow day lilies, palm trees and sea lavender).\n\nWe grow California poppies (not native to our area, but they are the only plants that have taken to a sandy slope on our property). They seem to love it hot and dry if you're looking for a drought tolerant native. Golden yellow is standard, but we have them in 4 different colors and they're easy to grow from seed, so you can cover large areas cheaply. Hope you're enjoying your new edible garden - sounds like a treat!\n\nWhat the phlox!\n\nThat's some great phlockin phlox!\n\nI would kill for my garden to grow like this!!! Instead all I get is crabgrass and stilt grass. 😕\n\nThis makes me think of all of the homes in the books that I read growing up that were supposed to be charming, cozy homes. So beautiful. Thanks for sharing, and well done to the homeowner!\n\nGorgeous!\n\nAll that phlox! I bet it smells as pretty as it looks.\n\nWow look at all that Phlox!! I have to wonder what's blooming earlier in the season though? 🤔\n\nIt's sure in its glory right now! And love those leaded windows...\n\nOMG!!\n\nHow does someone weed a garden like this? Or do you just not?\n\nI have something similar (no where near this grand though) and I do a combo of getting particularly pernicious stuff very early in the season (Chinese elm sprouts, milk weed, Virginia creeper) before everything blooms, laying fresh compost and mulch every year that in theory should be clear of unwanted seeds, some good ground cover plants under the flowers and weeding a little bit as I water every day.\n\nThe flowers are beautiful AND the house even looks happy! 😄\n\nSoooo gorge!!! This is exactly what my garden looks like… in my mind 😏😣\n\nfor some reason this makes me think of Miss Honey’s house in Matilda 😍😍😍\n\nr/fucklawns\n\nIs this by chance in a small town in Illinois?\neditto say those flowers are gorgeous!!\n\nSpokane, WA\n\nI’ve talked to the owner several times on my walks. They love those flowers so much. Every year they take the bulbs out and packs them away. I think 15 coolers last time I chatted.\n\nWait.  They dig up the flower bulbs and replant them every year??? Omg\n\nOnly the ones that are bulbs, the majority of what you see in the pic are perennials and come up every year, the tropical looking flowers, canna lilies, those have to be dug and stored over winter. I know people that store many totes over winter, I'm lucky to remember to dig anything up come fall, I'm usually too tired. \n\nOh cool! Can you confirm if those are Tall Phlox (*Phlox paniculata*) or Dame's Rocket (*Hesperis matronalis*)?\n\nPhlox has 5 petals and Dame's Rocket has 4.\n\n(PHLOX -5, DAME -4)\n\nI knew this house looked familiar! Rode my bike by the other day. I could smell it from almost a block away.\n\nThat whole neighborhood has some great yards, but that one is definitely the crown jewel.\n\nAh, nope. Not the same house I thought it was. Funnily enough, I used to live in Spokane!\n\nThought that looked like a PNW craftsman!\n\nI was thinking the same thing!  Looks right out of small town Illinois, go Woodstock!\n\nGoals\n\nIt's stunning, but why is there a case of water casually tossed in the middle? 🧐😑😎\n\nHOAs are sweating through their shorts.\n\nWow 🤩 amazing 😻\n\nLooks like the setting for a novel. \nBeautiful. Thanks for sharing.\n\nI can feel the happy sneeze coming.\n\n\"Hello, I'd like to buy every plant\"\n\n\n\n\"...what?\"\n\n\n\n\"You heard me.\"\n\nEverything looks so healthy!! I wonder how they keep powdery mildew at bay\n\nWow, I can only imagine the number of butterflies, bees and hummingbirds flying around there all day.\n\nThat is stunning! Thank you for taking the pic and sharing.\n\nA beauty scene in the making!\nWork of art!\n\nWow! I am loving the variety of blooming perennial. So many wonderful varieties beneficial for bees and butterflies.\n\nThis makes my heart soar\n\nGorgeous!!!\n\nWow!\n\nI know the bees are living LARGE 🐝🐝🐝🐝\n\nThese colors are so beautiful!\n\nThis deserves to be on a canvas!\n\nAbsolutely stunning 😍\n\ngorgeous!\n\nThis looks like real life animal crossing\n\nThat's dreamy. I need to try harder\n\nI know this house! My dog and I love walking by it-- the flowers partially enclose the sidewalk so it's like a little fairy tunnel.\n\nMy neighbors were just now complaining about “the bees definitely being up this year” Yes you read that right: Complaining!\n\nThis is truly lovely. I’m zone 3, could not imagine having this garden. A question though. Is that a case of water in the pic?\n\nJust curious, not criticizing.\n\nI asked the same question! 🧐😉\n\nThe funny thing is that HOAs preferes lawns to this...\n\nGive me now ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️\n\n This is like my dream house!\n\nWow that is one totally phloxy garden!\n\nPhloxy Lady, here I come!\n\n🎶*guitar jam*🎶\n\nSo you’re living my dream? 😖 thanks for rubbing it in.\n\nJk very beautiful!!\n\nAnd the best aspect of this flower garden is that all these flowers do not require much care.\n\nIf you turn around, you'll see phlox of insects and bees approaching\n\nAnd the color of the house! I just love it. What I wanted for my own, 110-yr-old farmhouse. 😢 But my husband and contractor / friend on the job were horrified and talked me out of it. I have regrets.\n\nholy phlox! that garden is stunning!\n\nGOALS! 💜🩷\n\nReminds me of Matilda’s new house when she goes to live with Ms. Honey.\n\nThat is beautiful. The HOA would like a word…\n\nhoa's must hate them\n\n If you like this just take a road trip in august thru Poland back roads, every house looks like that\n\nSo......much.......pollen.\n\nStunning\n\nIt's beautiful! I love the house, it reminds me of a better time.\n\nI thoroughly want my front yard to look like this. And my side yard too 🥰🥹😲👍🏾🤣\n\nBeautiful 😍\n\nSpokane!!!\n\nBeautiful!\n\nDoes it look like that all year?\n\nPure magic\n\nThat’s so beautiful. Looks like a lot of wildflowers.\n\nI love phlox.  I need to get lots more. It lasts most of the summer and butterflies loved it!\n\nThe layers of color are great!\n\nWhere is this?\n\nStunning!\n\njust discovered phlox! wondering how to add it to my garden\n\nSo so easy ! It took mine until the second year to really “show off” ! Easy to plant easy to care for!\n\nGreat color combos with the yellow house! So lively…\n\nGorgeous!\n\nThe dream!\n\nNo doubt, so beautiful\n\nLove how colorful it is!\n\nAbsolutely, beautiful and no weeding\n\nWow, that’s awesome\n\nIt's like a painting 😍\n\nbeautiful\n\nSoooo beautiful 🤩\n\nPhlox and tiger lillies\n\n I can’t believe that’s real it looks absolutely amazing, dream garden\n\nIts not real 😕\n\nI appreciate this. Thank you !!\n\nThat's a lot of phlox!\n\nAmazing how excited I get to see this:). So beautiful.\n\nThis is what the houses will be like in final fantasy.... amazing.\n\nI have most of the same flowers planted, however the fluffy tailed spawn of Satan find them tasty\n\nSo beautiful, it almost look fake. I wish my garden look like this.\n\nIt is fake.  This is an ai photo.\n\nBeauty 🩷\n\nOh man. This is my end goal.\n\nVery impressive that this is a perennial garden (and all US natives, too, from what I can see!) that looks better than most annual gardens. Suddenly feeling like I need more phlox in my garden.\n\nThis would be AMAZING at night if there were some warm white lights hidden below the flowers to make it glow from underneath!\n\nGlad I'm not the only one who takes pictures of other people's gardens! 😂 I love the inspiration!\n\nNow that is a garden! 😍\n\nThis is what I dream of having one day 😍\n\nI bet the bees and butterflies and lost in the sauce\n\nI wish i could have phlox in my front border but the deer come and eat it down to a nub as soon as i plant any\n\nBeautiful!!!\n\nGorgeous!\n\nthis is gorgeous Ty for sharing op!\n\nThis looks amazing. 😍\n\nI impulse purchased a fuck load of different varieties of *supposedly* deer resistant flowers at like 3 am today with precisely this vision in my head. My toddler is going to get lost.\n\nBeautiful!\n\nWow\n\nWow this is so pretty!!!!\n\nBeautiful flowers!\n\nWatch \" Everything is Illuminated \" till the end.\n\nI want to wake up to this amazing view every morning.\n\nBut, what that sign or whatever that is in it??\n\nWowwww so beautiful.wanted to do the same in my garden.my zone says fk u.\n\nEvidently no slugmaggedon there.\n\nBeautiful!\n\nImagine thinking lawns are superior to this\n\nI see a moonflower in there!\n\nI wish I could do something like this. I cannot keep plants alive. I'm notorious for killing them.\n\nGoals\n\nWhat zone is this garden in?\nI want to copy it! Gorgeous! I am in zone 9a!\n\nLove the bottled water on the chair!\n\nIs that what it is? I just posted about that, thank you!!! 💛🌼\n\nThe amount of airborne plant jizz is gonna be high. My nose just started running thinking about it.\n\nAbsolutely gorgeous! Where is this beauty?\n\nI actually it's not if that's their front yard it looks like hell.\n\nFound the President of the HOA."

More eco friendly, and even though they’re part of the local flora, I still never get over how beautiful and impressive they are.\n\nYou haven't been to a tropical jungle\n\nHot damn, apparently it can resist -7ºC, I could maybe get away with having one of these in my garden, thanks for sharing, that's an amazing plant!\n\nEdit for anyone rushing out to buy one of these: OP's variety is \"Thailand Giant\" which is not frost hardy. The basic variety is a bit smaller than this, but probably pretty cool anyway.\n\nSadly it can’t. But I will get it inside without the lesves and will try to get it through ghe winter like that.\n\nIs yours the \"Thailand Giant\" variety? From what I've looked up that one is harder to overwinter but the basic variety is fairly hardy.\n\nYes it is the Thailand Giant. I’m quite optimistic to get it through the winter. I got a lot of space and just in case strong artificial light.\n\nHi, I over-winter these in my southeastern Pennsylvania garden by cutting them off at ground level the week of thanksgiving and digging up the rhizome/bulb. They will usually have withered from a frost by then but frost won’t kill the bulb. I shake off the dirt and clip and tendrils from the bulb. They go in a feed bag (some are the size of infants) or a 5 gallon bucket in the basement. I’m not sure if that’s easier than hauling a big pot into the house but I have several dozen so it’s space practical. I plant them again in April. They are safe from spring frosts once planted/buried. It takes a good 6 weeks or them to appear (at least in this process &amp; micro climate) but they are head-high right now. It’s a bit of work but I enjoy the grandeur of them and the related exercise.\n\nSorry the infant sized rhizome comment has fucking sent me. Now can't unsee the mandrake baby from Harry Potter.\n\nI regularly remark “like the Infant of Prague” as i am excavating in the Fall 😉\n\nThat's super cool, would love to see pictures of your collection at any stage!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/667cm2nrkgjd1.jpeg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1a5a46da0fc165aae295f3bcac13f310316377d0\n\n“Downward pointing “ colocasia\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gfz0x8qxkgjd1.jpeg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=64d94d34941c59c7fa37cad01389d4772ac9462b\n\nThis past spring’s bulbs ready to go in.\n\nThose are Great Danes by the way 😄\n\nAt first glance, I thought they were *puppies*\n\nYou from Texas? You seem to enjoy the larger aspects of life.\n\nIs it a border wall of them? I’m in awe. Very beautiful\n\nThat's exactly what we do with the banana trees we have too.\n\nThey overwinter in black plastic garbage bags with straw in the garage.\n\nAh yeah, that will need bringing in. Apparently the hardy one is a fair bit smaller 😞\n\n I feel the struggle here I am trying to grow San Pedro cactus and penis cactus as far north as Wisconsin\n\nPenis cactus?! 😵\n\nIt’s a mutated variant of the Bolivian torch cactus\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qrd9lwlt6hjd1.jpeg?width=192&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4013819308d8d4995fb95c8d9a238a3a9434b86f\n\nThese ones aren’t mine hehe I’m just not at home right now\n\nSounds (and looks) painful! 😉\n\nSpined for her pleasure.\n\nYea uh I kinda see how it’s a struggle to grow a desert plant in temperate climate region. Lmao\n\nI tried it to overwinter in my garden house, didnt work and died. -7°C is overrated i think.\n\nI worked at a guys house who had a “Mammoth” variety in zone 6b and he said he digs up the bulb and puts it in his garage wrapped in straw over winter.\n\nI think you need to overwinter these and dig up the tubers. The foliage won't last in the frost.\n\nIsn’t that exactly what he said 👀\n\nyeah my bad lol that's what he said\n\nI'm in a place where it barely snows, but we can have a week-long stretches of night time temps well below freezing. I've been able to keep mine (I have a few types including the Thai Giant) alive, outside, but they are in a bricked-in bed in contact with the house, and I heap mulch (pine straw) over them at the start of winter. The colder the winter, the smaller they grow the following summer... but it's possible, so long as you are thoughtful about it.\n\nDo you think heavily mulching and throwing a bed sheet with some string lights under it during cold snaps would help it at all? Really want to add these to my 9a garden in South Carolina.\n\nTotally worth trying. The bedsheet.. don't see the point of, if you are adding a thick pile of mulch (like.... 9\"). Sheets are good for things up in the air (evergreen trees, shrubs). I've never used string lights, but I want to try that this winter too - I have a potted meyer lemon tree that I've also successfully kept outside (wrapped and tucked under the carport) for a decade. The string lights make a lot of sense, so long as they are incandescent and not LED. \n\nAnd, just try it! An elephant ear is, what, 50$ at the store? That's not a ton of money to lose over a year-long experiment. If it works, you can expand to other individuals and varieties. \n\nAnd, you can also dig the corns up in early winter and keep them in a bucket of soil in your garage/basement, before replanting in spring. This is a hassle but if you wanted to divide the corns for more plants, that'd be a cost-effective way to do it, and less risk of freeze damage.\n\nI'm too lazy to dig after up planting, honestly. Everything I've planted so far I know can survive here and they're perennial for minimal effort in future years. \n\nDo you trim yours for winter or just let the foliage die back?\n\nFair, me too. I let it die back and then cut the stem right above the soil. If the leaves are still green, then they are still feeding the corms for next spring, so I leave them as long as they are green-ish. But the first freeze will turn the base stems to mush, very messy, so I try to cut them down before that. They're very easy to cut through, any knife or shears will do.\n\nInteresting, my climate is quite similar, maybe I could manage it!\n\nI need to know if these can grow in Austin TX! I have a feeling the 110° summer temperatures and once-a-week watering restrictions might do it in though.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/85zcddlptfjd1.png?width=527&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e49c05dab806aeaed50dd0a02715dcc4fa63cb7a\n\nHahahhaha this has me rolling!\n\nI just sent this to my wife like \"This you\" when she has sick days 🤣\n\nas seen in almost every thread in /r/ThriftStoreHauls\n\nI just came from that subreddit and can confirm lol\n\nWhoa. Looks like it belongs in the Super Mario movie.\n\nKind of reminded me of the floating plants that grow from the magic beans in Zelda Ocarina of Time\n\nMy brain does not understand. I will need a toddler for scale. If no toddler is available, a banana will suffice in place of a toddler.\n\nOr cheeseburger for us Americans\n\nNah, banana for scale is the perfect universal measurement.\n\nHas it spoken to you yet? Something like \"feed me Seymour\"?\n\nSomebody definitely fed the plant.\n\nHe fed him a delicious dentist 😋\n\nIdk why but I thought your shadow was a cartoon man screaming\n\nGonna take a giant bite out of that leaf.\n\nWent back to look. I needed that laugh thank you 😂\n\nIt totally does good catch! Now that I'm looking at the shadow, I can't make sense of it\n\nThat’s fantastic! I’m in Canada but I would love to try and grow these!! It would look hysterical in my pasture by the barn!\n\nWell, I guess you're not in my part of Canada. No way this would survive more than a few months.\n\nOh I don’t expect it to live beyond the cold days but I am in SE Ontario. We get some crazy hot spells in July and August. The OP said it was about 2 months to get to that size. Worth a try!\n\nMy biggest concern is the winds here. I think I might put it right beside the barn or fence line.\n\nOh ok I get you. I'd love if it could survive indoors. Outside I just have native plants and trees otherwise it's too rough. Gaspesie here.\n\nWhere did you get the seeds from\n\nJust gave the family cow to a wandering bean salesman. 🤷‍♂️\n\nhttps://onszaden.com/Leucocasia_gigantea_Thailand-Giant\n\n\nI highly recommend this site.\n\nI also bought some seeds there.\n\nIt was a Dutch website but sadly I don’t remember the name:(\n\nGo through your emails for a receipt or an order confirmation\n\nActually found an old email. I got the seeds from onszaden.nl\n\nHook that thing up to a generator and power your house\n\nWill the roots not destroy your tiles?\n\nI hope they don’t, for now it’s all good.\n\nAnd you are gonna dog it up for winter?\n\nCatting it is better imo.\n\nSeems fishy\n\nQuit horsing around!\n\nI have read that these, like Colocasia, can be kept dormant all winter if stored between 7C and 15C (45-60F), which may be easier than trying to maintain a huge sun-loving plant in the house.  It is absolutely gorgeous.  I don’t keep Leucocasia or Colocasia but do have an Alocasia (that struggles for me) and a number of Remusatia vivipara, the hitchhiking elephant ear, which I find easy to grow but rare in cultivation.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yzh507yrnfjd1.jpeg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2c22d57cb8c9ce1c94f8f862522a3487206ddd7c\n\nRemusatia vivipara in partial shade under Begonia boliviensis.\n\nLush  💚\n\nThis is going to yield some pretty big strawberries.\n\nWhere in Germany do you live? I'm living in the South and after seeing your post I am intrigued to try that, too.\n\nIm living in nrw close to Dortmund. You should definitely try it. Get it to a good size indoors and then just set it outside and watch it grow. I’d say now is a good time to start for next year.\n\nAlready in the process of ordering one from Jungle Leaves. Thanks for the info, wanted to redo our garden next year anyway, so perfect timing. Gl with yours, hope it will survive winter but those have been getting warmer year over year anyway.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5j8x0nnyrgjd1.png?width=529&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=97894313588001dc5c8014986c0534f124793d8c\n\nWow!  I’m over here wondering if you’ll have to bring it inside for the winter and if so, how?\n\nIm planing on cutting all the leaves and plant the bulb in a pot. Guess that should work for winter.\n\nI was looking for elephant leaves to make concrete bird baths. This would be a bird pool!\n\nHa, great idea! Your birdies would love you!\n\nIs that ET taking the photo\n\nThe shadow is KILLING ME!!! Even it looks shocked! Hahahaha! \n\nNice wee plant, by the way! That is the stuff of Jack and the Beanstalk!\n\nDon’t you get tired from the constant growls of “feed me, Seymour, feed me!”?\n\nWhoa, better get a handle on that plant or it’ll be living in the house and you’ll be planted in the garden\n\nThis in my brain feels wrong like uncanny valley wrong lmao. Amazing work though that species has always amazed me!\n\nEveryone is talking about the plant, but I’m more concerned about why your shadow looks like you’re so flabbergasted your jaw is wide open..?\n\nBA BOOM! 🌱😄😆\n\nIt looks like a Lego plant.\n\nDidnt know you could grow a parachute 😂 but wow what a cool plant!\n\n[deleted]\n\nGet them digits to the girls first ;)\n\nFeed me, Seymour!\n\nCame here to say this!!\n\nTalk about Fan Leaves lol 🍃\n\n*Cries in plant hardiness zone 5b*\n\nWhy not grow it as an annual? It gets plenty big enough in 1 year lol.\n\nIt doesn't get quite as big here, possibly because of the shorter growing season.\n\nThen you dig it up, cut the leaves, and store it upside down in a dark cool place. I did try that, and it dried out past saving. 😭\n\nOne thing I’ve learned about overwintering plants is that when they tell you to store them in a “cool, dark place” there’s an implied “but not cool or dark enough to kill a plant”. Which honestly makes no sense because we all know I’m bringing this inside and my house is lit normally and is one damn temperature except for maybe in a windowless basement utility closet or semi-heated garage. So where the fuck is cool and dark, relative to regular ass room temperature and regular ass corner of the room light-levels, that will not kill a plant?? Idk so I just do cuttings now. Let me know if you figure it out.\n\nI feel seen!\n\nI know someone in town who does overwinter the elephant ear hostas, but he has an attached garage, so it's warmer than my garage but colder than my house. I can't win.\n\nImagine being in it's natural habitat.\n\nGood googly moogly. That's a freakishly large plant, and in Germany‽\n\nThat's insane!\n\nGrew that big inside? Grow lights?\n\nGrew it just in the beginning indoors. It traveled from a 60w Sansi to a 100w lm301h diy to a 350w lm301h. But probably a little overkill, would also work with only 60w sansi.\n\nDino level plants 🔥🔥🔥\n\nBetter start gathering some humans to feed it.\n\nOmg!! 😍\n\nNitrogen be like\n\nI can't be the only one who finds it hard to believe this is just one year? \n\nNo? \n\nJust me?\n\nAmazing incredible and gorgeous. Well done.\n\nBe sure to update us during and after winter hits!\n\nImagine if parents decided their one year olds the same way\n\nImpressive 👍🏽\n\nKnown as Manto de Eva too. Amazing growth.\n\nThis has little petshop vibes.\n\nHow is that even possible\n\nThis looks like the leaves from Zelda OoT. Put some bugs in the soil.\n\nIt's such a photogenic plant, love it. Keep us updated\n\nWhat a beautiful plant! I wish I could grow one where I live, but it can get really cold here (-40C) in Alberta so I’ll just live vicariously through yours 🥰\n\nProfessor copperfields miracle legumes?!?\n\nSTUNNING!!!\n\nThis is beautiful!! 😍\n\nMy goodness, what beauty!\n\nAudrey, that you?\n\nwow👏👏\n\nzone 7-11 you can wait for the leaves to wilt in the winter and then cover it with hay.\n\nThis giant one grows in the drain outside my house, but the small kochu(taro) are more common.\n\nThese are good to eat but you have to boil them to make them non-toxic.\n\nIt’s a real-life Jack and the Beanstalk.\n\nthat is huge wtf\n\nOkay, I need a green house just so I can plant this beauty.\n\nPlant some hydrangeas around it. They will flower pretty well under the Taro’s shade\n\nWhoa!\n\nJurassic Park greens? Wow, hard to wrap you head around the size of your plant and also not to feel worried they will take over your neighborhood!\n\nWhat is that?\n\nThat’s incredible great job\n\nThe tile piece next to it makes it seem like it….erm…. escaped from the earth. Watch your back she may be hungry.\n\nIt’s to big!\n\nWow!!!\n\nSo amazing! Nature is incredible, so is your talent! Lovely, thank you for sharing!\n\nI could be wrong, but this looks like CGI.\n\nThat’s to funny. Seems like I did a good job growing it if people think it isn’t real:D I’d love to proof to you that it’s real, maybe just look at my profile, there is the same plant 1 month ago.\n\nGeez!  \n\nAnd my little baby Japanese maples that we collected this Spring are only 1\" to 6\" high.  All 160 of them.  We'll see how many survive to next Spring.  That one tree puts out A LOT of babies. This is the first year we decided to help them grow, rather than just mow them.\n\nI genuinely thought this was /r/confusingperspective ...\n\nQuestion: Did you start the seeds germination in the ground or did you start small and continually upsize when repotting? I just started some from seed and have idea what I’m doing. 😊\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tkoi4xhydhjd1.jpeg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=34476ca1eab48e7adabf557d3c86f412c574098c\n\nThat’s one happy plant-buddy! 🪴 Well done!\n\nFEED ME SEYMOUR!\n\nThose look great!

The tubers are also delicious,of course only some varieties can be eaten.\n\nlook like jungle! 😨 so pretty\n\nr/absoluteunits\n\nwhat type of plant is this\n\nThat's yam right?\n\nMy dad planted this and it grew to this proportion on Borneo. I tried in California and it did not even sprout from the rhizome.\n\nHow deep do the roots get? I have a spot where my water line in 10ft under.\n\nThe node!!🙈😅😅\n\nLooks like a willy wonka plant\n\nIt’s so big and beautiful.\n\nWow 😍\n\nWait actual seed? Or baby bulbils?\n\nIve been generating AI images all day, and i was 99% convinced this was generated with midjourney initially\n\nWow! That's bigger than the one we planted months ago as a transplant. I think it's actually been too hot, here. I'm zone 7a in South Central Pennsylvania, United States.\n\nI've got one of those, it was a volunteer, it's almost 1/3 bigger than one in post.\n\nFascinating!\n\nWow! How much fertilizer did you use? Looks awesome\n\nThat's awesome. \n\nLiebe Grüße aus Essen 🫡\n\nWhat seed is this?"

I [am attempting to] grow tropicals (mangos, pineapple, bananas) and my collection is starting to outgrow the little greenhouse I built. I've already expanded it once. I think maybe I enjoy pain. I do the loquat shuffle every winter too.\n\nKeep fighting the good fight. 🫡👩🏾‍🌾\n\nYep, I'm right there with you. I have the maximum amount I can bring in and out which is what I've been doing since 2 years ago. The greenhouse we built was destroyed by wind and we haven't been able to afford to replace it yet. I've got all sorts of tropicals myself just like you, bananas etc. That I have to bring in every year. Thankfully I have just decent enough light to keep them alive through the winter.\n\nZone pushers unite!\n\n🤙🤙. Zone 5b. Just brought my Parfianka Pom, and a few different figs inside for the winter. \n\nPawpaws, dapple dandy, Tlor-Tsiran Apricot, all pushing their boundaries. \n\nMy peacotum and another aprium did not survive. R. I. P.\n\n4b haha… I I know there are some 4a’s in the house. We froze on September 6 😫\n\nMe also crying as squirrels ate every piece of fruit across 20 fruit trees 😫\n\nI only have three but they stole all but one. I don’t mind sharing but please, let me have enough to make an effing pie! We have tried netting, large fake owls and snakes, spraying them with water guns whenever we spy them (lol) and putting out water for them because I read that the reason the take ONE BITE and toss it is because they’re thirsty. They are insatiable and incorrigible and I guess the trees are theirs. 😭\n\nWe put nets on our pear trees this year after only getting 1 pear last year, and the squirrels didn’t get a single one! Putting the nets on was extremely difficult, but we got waaaaaaaaaaaay more pears than we could ever eat and we have been giving away tons.\n\n10b checking in, I’m excited to get STARTED since summer temps/humidity make growing anything difficult.\n\nCries in zone 3 😭\n\n😓😓😓😓 yea you're down bad.\n\nLiterally came here to post this 🤣\n\nGlad to see I wasn’t alone lmao\n\nMaybe one day I’ll live in one place long enough to plant fruit trees\n\n🤣🤣🤣\n\nThat’s an enormous amount of fruit! What will you do with it all OP?\n\nMost of them were given away. The apple and cherry trees didn’t yield a lot of fruit so we ate them straight from the tree. Peaches, nectarine, and grapes yielded so much we gave most of them to family and neighbors. I did do a lot of baking with the peaches. Made a delicious upside down fruit cake just yesterday! I will be doing some pomegranate molasses with the ones left in the tree. I like to add it in salad dressings.  And the olives will be cured and put in jars. They last a whole year!\n\nLucky neighbors! I’m going to try to grow a dwarf peach or nectarine tree this year. I’m dreaming of the taste of fresh fruit.\n\nwhat do you do with the cactus??\n\nOmg, pomegranate molasses sounds soooo good!! I need to try that asap!!\n\nZone?\n\nWhat zone are you in? Super jealous\n\nI’m in a Mediterranean climate zone. I think you could consider it zone 9. We have mild winters and warm summers. We have a long growing season!\n\nYou’re so lucky to have that beautiful harvest! I’m so sad my harvest days are coming to an end i live in the Midwest zone 5b it’s been warm lately but also cold so my last plants don’t stand a chance lol\n\nIt's warming back up. Might even hit eighty again in a couple weeks.\n\nHow do you keep the squirrels away from your peaches\n\nI've been using mesh fruit bags I bought on Amazon for my pomegranates and im happy with the results compared to previous years when the squirrels got almost all the fruit. You put it over the fruit when it's still small, pull the drawstring and the fruit keeps growing in the bag. I had about 30-40 poms this year. It would be a bit of work for a bigger tree but it kept the squirrels out so maybe worth it.\n\nI had a feeling this was in the Mediterranean, which country?\n\nIs it all used fresh or do you preserve anything?\n\nI'm so envious!\n\nIf it's not overstepping to ask, are you in the US? Because if so, I had no idea you could grow pomegranates (one of my favorites!) here! \nAbsolutely gorgeous harvest &amp; I'm having gardening envy big time! Lost my house after my ex husband bailed 14 years ago &amp; haven't had a yard again since. 😔\n\nYou can actually grow pomegranates in a lot of the US! The cold hardy Russian pomegranates can easily survive in-ground through zone 7 even, and there's a huge domestic pomegranate industry in California and I think into Arizona.\n\nI'm in NJ and have two cold hardy varieties (Eve and Surh Anor), too young to be producing yet but growing well. I've also seen a lot of people on the east coast/mid-Atlantic saying good things about Salavatski and am thinking about adding it.\n\nWell howdy neighbor! I'm in Jersey too! I'm pretty far up north and I'm really shocked that you can grow pomegranates here. When I was a kid, people called them \"Chinese Apples \", so I guess my brain immediately associates them with coming from far, far away. Lol.\n*edit word cuz the coffee hasn't kicked in yet!\n\nI’m in AZ and people grow pomegranates here. My moms neighbor has two and they always end up rotting on the trees because they never pick them. Makes me so sad. Pomegranates are delicious!\n\nLebanon\n\nCame here to ask this, too! I would love some of these in my desert garden.\n\nYeah, crying over here in Minnesota\n\nI'm going to guess this is somwhere in Southern California, a little east of the coast because the apples/cherries/almonds like a nice chill which the coast doesn't get. The heat is great for loquats/olives/peaches and prickly pears. \n\nSo I guess its a zone 9.\n\nCould be Northern California too! All of the things that OP posted grow super well in some areas of NorCal. Looks like OP is in Lebanon though so not actually California at all!\n\nVery true. I think the loquats made me think SoCal. Just seemed mediteranian. Lebanon also makes sense.\n\nLoquats grow well in the Bay Area too! Back in the day I ate so many while sitting in my grandmother’s tree :)\n\nDoes Lebanon get more rain than California? Because we had a leak in our drip system so my husband just turned the whole thing off, and despite HOURS I have spent in the backyard with a hose trying to keep things alive, everything is crispy and small and it makes me feel so defeated.\n\n(I don’t know enough about our irrigation system  to fix it myself but I guess this will motivate me to remedy that!)\n\nMy neighbors backyard has all of these except the cherries and grapes. Southern California (Orange County)\n\nWhat does that mean when people talk about zones??\n\nUSDA hardiness zone.  Google it for the map.\n\nI grow all that stuff in zone 9a. But most of it could also be grown  in zone 8 too.\n\nAny recommendation for cherries in zone 8b? It’s Deep South so humid.\n\nI’m definitely not the guy to ask about that. I have very limited climate knowledge about the U.S. southeast. \n\nI can tell you the generalizations that most of us know. Of course, that doesn’t tell the whole story. \n\nJust like how it’s inaccurate to say that  rainy it’sand miserable for 9 months in the Pacific Northwest, it’s equally inaccurate to say the southeast of America is a humid cesspool most of the year. In fact, both places are pretty damn near ideal for a significant portion or the calendar. \n\nHere’s the limited knowledge I have about the Deep South: it typically rains a significant amount every month, is gorgeous from late September until the end of May and then is as hot and humid as satan’s bunghole during the summer. \n\nAbout right, give or take? \n\nSo, here are some cherry cultivars they grow commercially for zones 9a and 8b in Northern California and western Oregon: \n\nLapin\nBing\nSweetheart \nMontmorency\n\nI’m sure there are countless others, but those are the cherry cultivars I’ve encountered often as I cruise around the Sacramento Valley, Rouge River Valley and Willamette Valley. \n\nHumidity isn’t really a thing here during hot weather. When the weather is chilly from late fall to mid spring it is humid as all get out, but that’s because it’s raining all the damn time. Raining but also between 35 and 65 degrees 90% of the time.\n\n[deleted]\n\nThey *created* a paradise, literally from the ground up.\n\nMy dream garden\n\nGuess you're from Malta? Since those almost all the fruit that grows here lol.\n\nThough not sure what that last picture is.\n\nLast picture is a 2 year old green apple tree. It’s still not ripe in the picture. I’m from Beqaa - Lebanon. They’re both included in the Mediterranean climatic region, so I can see why there would be similarities in the fruits that we grow!\n\nI hope that you, your family and your beautiful garden stay safe! And that all the violence ends soon.\n\nThank you so much for the kind words!!!\n\nLove seeing yummy things out of the Beqqa valley. It's on my list of places to visit someday!\n\nIt truly is an amazing place with really delicious food. I hope you get to visit one day when everything is safe again!\n\nStay safe, my friend. Beautiful beautiful bounty you've created!!\n\nhope you're safe\n\nWhen can I come to your place for vacation?\n\nAll that stuff also grows along the US west coast within 80 miles of the coast.\n\nI do a lot of canning and those peaches make me weep. Beautiful fruit!\n\nThank you!! Did a lot of baking with the peaches. I do plan on canning the ones left in my fridge!\n\nWow you’re rich 🥲😍💗\n\nThe kind of rich I want to be 😍\n\nThank you. I am indeed rich! I wish everyone could experience this kind of richness. Growing your own food and connecting with nature is truly a superior form of wealth!! Wouldn’t it be lovely if people, including those in power, focused more on that rather than chasing material gains? This is the type of wealth that brings prosperity!! I’m very grateful\n\nWhat are the oblong green fruits in the 10th photo?\n\nGreen almonds. They’re very crunchy and juicy. The middle has a jelly like texture. I like to dip it in a tiny bit of salt. It’s delicious!\n\nWow, I never knew that you could eat green almonds! Thank you, and hope you and your family stay safe!\n\nOhh you should try it! Thank you very much for the kind words!!\n\nFresh almonds\n\nThey look beyond perfect Subhan Allah. What a dream.\n\nThank you. I’m very grateful!\n\nBeautiful ! It must be so satisfying to harvest all of these.\n\nThank you! It sure is!!\n\nYou have pomegranates AND figs? You genuinely have no clue how jealous I am. I'm really really jealous. I'd kill for this😭♥️ godddd\n\nThis is real wealth. Beautiful!\n\nI grew a lot of these things in my Arizona garden. Had an amazingly productive peach tree, huge black mission fig (2 crops a year) variety of citrus, including Meyer lemon and Ruby red grapefruit, and a pomegranate. Nothing like picking peaches off the tree first thing in the morning and gorging yourself for breakfast🤤\nIdiots who bought my house cut down everything but the grapefruit. Made me heartsick and disgusted.\n\nOmgggg that is my nightmare. Makes me hesitate to put anything in the ground 😭\n\nAbundance! 🤙🏽🤙🏽😮‍💨😮‍💨\n\nIts not too late to give your location.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u8tz7mi6qpvd1.jpeg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d2d0800fa950ff4bc6c6bc57d3a0f60013ea944e\n\nSome of my carrots 🙂‍↕️😂😂😂\n\nall want to know the location, me too! im gonna tell you, im in Izmir, Turkey, Zone 9b, and it looks extremely like gardens here!! and that you're eating green almonds... i've never seen people eat green almonds except in Turkey, so tell me now, where are u at? ;)\n\nOP mentioned the location as Bekaa Valley, Lebanon.\n\nI so want to visit Izmir!\n\nWtf. You live in the garden of eden?\n\nYou practically live in the garden of Eden\n\n[removed]\n\nThank you very much!\n\nThis is beautiful! Much to admire and aspire to here! Amazing 🤩\n\nThose are the bluest grapes I’ve ever seen. Beautiful!\n\nWow thats amazing! But where is the mango tree? :)\n\nI am so jealous of you, I have a lot of trees but everything is being eaten by animals , insects,  birds.  I hardly get any good shape fruit. No matter what I do to protect them like netting, spray...\n\nDamn, what type of miraculous dirt is that? Do you talk to your plants?\n\nWhoa!  Awesome!\n\nWhere do you live that you're able to grow so much fruit?!\n\nIn zone 7b you can grow stone fruit, apples, pears, grapes, raspberries blackberries blueberries strawberries berries berries, melons, figs..a lot of fruits!\n\nFantastic for you. Jealous as squirrels got almost everyone of my peaches apples and pears.\n\nYour pomegranates are stunning 🤩\n\nThat pomegranate 😍 I love where I live but we’re definitely limited in terms of fruit we can grow and it’s really only in season for a few months during the warm season. I LOVE all kinds of fruit though. \n\nVery nice. How wonderful. So nice. \n::discreetly hides failed cilantro crop::\n\nHoly shit!! Congrats!!!\n\nOmg!! Your post filled me with happiness and I don't even own a garden!!!\n\nI love this for you! This is what it’s all about: being able to grow your own food. The food at the grocery store nowadays is trash, and sprayed with all kind of chemicals. My next house has to have a huge yard so I can grow me some fruit trees 🌳 😀\n\nWow 😍😍\n\nAmazing fruit garden!\n\nThis is awesome\n\nThis is wonderful!!!\n\nPomegranates! I’m so jealous! Beautiful harvest, OP! Great job!\n\nLooks super delicious, you must have quite a green thumb. Hoping to have a garden this lush one day!\n\nYou are so blessed! Can't wait to have my own fruit trees\n\nCan I live there and help you! What a dream 😍\n\nWOW! That‘s like paradise! 🤩\n\nI'm actually curious about this, how can I get a garden this flush? I'm 30 now and am worried that I won't be able to plant and harvest fruiting trees until I'm 45 even if I get a house at 35.\n\nWow! Beautiful!\n\nwhere do you live? awesome\n\nStop it! This is gardening pron 🙈\n\nSO jealous! Enjoy!!!\n\nSo gorgeous! Thank you for sharing!\n\nI'm hella jelly\n\nStunning. It was a broad variety !\n\nWow! What wonderful harvest!\n\nWow. Truly incredible!\n\nYou’re in a Goldilocks zone\n\n*Cries in Georgia wooded lot*\n\nthis is making me miss lebanon🤍☹️\n\nWow!! Where do you live?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xe1ji0apdnvd1.jpeg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d926a409a98c1d3172928ccb3ce9c07d832f39cc\n\nPapaya's grow fast!!!\n\nSo amazing! Do you have any tips to keep squirrels from eating all of it before it's ripe? I have lots of very large live oaks and they make their way from those to my pear tree and demolish it every year\n\nWow! When I lived in CA, I had a lot of fruit trees, too. I miss them so much. I hope the people who bought our house enjoy what I planted. We had figs, cherries, pomegranates, limes, lemons, plums, kumquat, apples, apricots, persimmons and pineapple guava. You are truly blessed. You’re growing far more than I did. Enjoy!\n\nNice! Any advice on the peaches? This is my second year with them, last year I only had like 3 peaches, this year I had a whole lot (too much to count) but they didn’t grow that big or got ripe, and some had a clear sap to them. I’m hoping next year I get a lot again but they get full size and no sap.\n\nPrickly pear? What kind!! Mine are almost ready too\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bjacpbb6vrvd1.jpeg?width=1170&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dac8a3aa6f786aa396e0f9c54113fbf7438012f8\n\n😋😋🙌\n\nOmg I want one\n\nPomegranates ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥\n\nWait why the green figs? Are they green when ripe?\n\n…I want figs so bad now\n\nThere are green varieties as well as purple! I think I prefer the green, the ones I’ve had have always been more honeylike and sweet\n\nWe are in Zone 10 (San Diego) and we are fortunate to grow Asian pear, Santa Rosa plum, apricot, Mission figs, peaches, lemons, limes, oranges, tangerines, Cutie tangerines, and grapefruits. Oh, and loquats but none of us like them so I want to pull it and put in a pomegranate. In the veggie department we had had an abundance of tomatoes from 14 different heirloom tomato plants, jalapeños, Italian roasting peppers, Basil, parsley, thyme, and cilantro.\n\nGreat variety.  I grow loquats but as an ornamental. Wildlife gets the fruit.\n\nDo you know which apple cultivar you’ve planted? What about the almonds? I’m not scared of growing anything else here (9b/10a), besides the almonds and the apples for some reason\n\nWhy no feijoa (pineapple guava), citrus or avocado? I’m likely in roughly the same zone as you, and definitely wouldn’t pass up on having a lemonade or guacamole tree. Plus the feijoa are phenomenal fruit that ripens in November and December. \n\nAs honorable mention I think fuyu, persimmon, kiwi and Chilean guava are excellent choice for zone 8-10. \n\nThose loquat look nice. So many I come across are seedlings with minimal flesh to seed ratio. What cultivar are you growing? I suppose it would be possible it’s a seedling too, especially if you got lucky.\n\nWhat do you do with your loquats (picture 15/16)? We have a tree but the fruits usually end up going to wildlife.\n\nWe also have a loquat tree. I am considering pulling it out because none of us really like loquats. Last year I did make a loquat bread from a recipe I found on Pinterest. It had almonds and some type of honey glaze on it. Just not something I’d make all the time.\n\nYour prickly pear fruit turn yellow when ripe, not red?\n\n🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻\n\nSo jealous 😁\n\nThis is amazing!\n\nThats amazing. I suck at gardening I guess! I did get a good bit of nanking cherries,loguat,jujubes,a few figs,goji berries,black berries..A few Kumquat citrus are popping right now. but so may things failed. Peaches. plums. I grew one tomato. One!\n\nOmg jealous, what a lovely fruit garden 🥹😍\n\nIs that a nopale cactus ??? I love them in recipes\n\nBeautiful!!\n\nthose prickly pears look soo cool, never seen one before\n\nWow. How do you keep bugs away?\n\nJealous\n\nBeautiful!\n\nThose grapes are calling my name. A fresh grape off the vine is my favorite.\n\nYou are blessed !!\n\nSpectacular!!!\n\nWow! Incredible\n\nFabulous! Thanks for sharing. Great job, blessed harvest.\n\nBeautiful bounty! What did you do with all your figs? We have two trees and we’re completely overwhelmed this year — couldn’t give them away fast enough!\n\nYUM! I want to eat at your house 🤤\n\nWhat a dream!\n\nMega jealous of your prickle pears, they look so good!\n\nOh my goodness looks like heaven!\n\ni want to be you\n\nWow ! This is amazing!\n\nWow.  Nice results 👌\n\nHey what do you call the penultimate picture?\n\ndo you live in heaven?\n\n😍😍\n\nI wish I could grow figs and pomegranates!\n\nWooowww how much space do you have to grow all this?? 😍\n\nVery nice haul. I’m in WV, we had a horrible drought this year, even with watering I only got a handful of tomatoes. Everything else died even one of my pear trees.\n\n😍\n\nUgh I’m so jealous 😩\n\nNice!!!!\n\nLoquats FTW! 🙌\n\nWow!\n\nWhat time is snack\n\nHonestly, this makes my heart burst. Lucky you!\n\nDeer are the reason I can’t have nice things.\n\nAmazing! (You must be in California or something like that...) Jealous 😺\n\nEverything looks gorgeous! You are blessed!\n\nWOW! Looks like you’ve been investing lots of time and love. Congrats!\n\nSo fucking impressive. Wow. Ugh.\n\nThis is so amazing, you live in paradise!\n\nMy mouth did that thing ,they look so delicious\n\nTotally jealous of the figs. Great work!\n\nYou're living part of my dream. When I get a house, I want to plant a small orchard with my favorite fruit trees as part of the big garden I will have. Thanks for sharing! Not only did I smile today because of your post, but this genuinely made me happy.\n\nI’ve always wanted to try green almonds 😍 Congratulations on such an amazing haul! 💖\n\nWhat a beautiful bounty! Adding to the massive jealousy across this thread. May your garden continues to be fruitful in the seasons ahead!!\n\nAwesome!! 😎 enjoy!!!\n\nOh my gosh incredible\n\nWhat variety of pomegranate did you grow?"

    "all_comment_text": "I grow cleome every year and I love it.  The flowers, the aroma and how it attracts the honey bees.  God bless your mom\n\nMe too. Bees and hummingbirds all day and moths all night. I get more compliments on them than any other flower in the yard.\n\nI had a cleome and someone stole it. I know what they thought it was. I'm sure they were disappointed.\n\nIt used to grow in the cracks of the pavement in my backyard growing up. Brings back memories. Especially as I got older with realizing how it did smell like Indiana wild ditch weed, lol.\n\nLooking like a total G with that Yeungling in hand too\n\nTY for confirming! lol I zoomed in but I haven’t seen a can in ages. A nice cold one goes well with a day of gardening\n\nSpecifically a black &amp; tan too I think by the darker color can\n\nYuengling black and tans are fantastic.\n\nI want to be her when I grow up\n\nIn the 1980s I lived in a townhouse community. I asked for and received permission to grow tomato plants, in pots, right off my patio in what was effectively “community property.” Mid-summer I answered my door to be greeted by three fairly aggressive cops, telling me a neighbor had called complaining that I was growing pot. I took the officers to look at the plants. We all laughed so hard I don’t know that they even asked my name! They. Were. Tomatoes. 😒\n\nThe 💩 people concern themselves with.\n\nWeird lady of the village spread that  the hard rock guy in the village  grew pot on his balcony,  it was  tomatoes and basil, the guy loves making tomato sauce.   So she  then  spread rumours that  the newly moved in couple grew pot in the  attic, due to grow lights.  They grow and sell begonias.\n\nBegonias are great. Got one in a hanging basket I've had for a year now and after nearly dying over summer (forgot to water...) it exploded with growth inside during winter with some proper attention.\n\nSo far this one can withstand all the abuse I put it through\n\nI have a begonia that sprouted in an orchid pot and seemed to just be barely existing. After 3 years I took a cutting and rooted it over the winter and planted it this spring and it is living its best life. Huge and full of blooms.\n\nI love begonias. There are so many different ones too! There’s thousands of varieties.\n\n“Everybody I don’t like happens to grow pot!”\n\nEven if it were pot, honestly who cares. I am not gonna go snitch to the police over something as minor as that.\n\nSeems this is where Reddit jumps in and says she’s just projecting. It’s HER who is growing weed.\n\n\"Suspicion always haunts the guilty mind;\"  - King Henry VI (5.6.11)\n\nI had the cops called on me because I AM growing cannabis in my back yard. In a state where we are allowed up to 6 adult plants per adult (12 max) and I only have one. even with legalization people are weird about it. They just checked I had less than the legal requirement and left. \n\nFunny phrase, “legal requirement.” Like everyone MUST grow X number of cannabis plants. 😂\n\nLol didn't even notice I said legal requirement instead of legal limit. Everyone MUST grow pot because it's too in-demand. You will chill and you will legally be required to enjoy it.\n\nI don’t know if the world would be a better place, but it would be a lot more relaxed if that were the case…\n\nThere used to be a mandate to grow hemp back in the early days of the American settlers\n\nWhy? Industrial-type uses?\n\nYep, 1500s British monarchy had ordered farmers to grow it so they could produce sails.  Later on this allowed other similar laws to force hemp to be grown for many different uses, including across the colonies.  A lot of it was shipped back to europe to be traded but a lot of it was also used in the americas\n\nDon’t forgot all the rope for anchors and sails and holding up ones breeches.  I remember even  up to the 70’s Dad always brought home rope made from hemp because snakes allegedly won’t cross it.\n\nAh yes, back when a man had to carry his spoon in his back pocket, lest he be caught without one.\n\nHemp is the same family but doesn't produce cannabinoids at nearly the same level I think, so it was entirely for things like hemp rope and fabrics. It's an extremely strong fiber that has many uses and even in the 90s I remember hemp fabrics being a thing for sustainability. It just had a stigma because it was so close to marijuana that no one wanted to touch it commercially and risk their brand. Synthetics have overtaken it because of that rise but it also means we have things more plastic derived today like polyester.\n\nI remember right after the election when Washington legalized it but Oregon's bill didn't pass (sadly, I was on the OR side), this woman in my exercise class started warning everyone about pot cookies that were being nefariously transported across the WA-OR border. My first thought was \"I want one\" and the second was \"who are these wealthy pot barons smuggling cookies to scare middle-class white women?\"\n\nListening to WAY too much right wing radio BS, this is always the sort of story these people make up for those shows.\n\nLol I have 12 monstrous plants\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2ua8aiqu7xkd1.jpeg?width=3021&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce8d72e57c769a7e938a83e0e29a51da68b143d3\n\nNobody in my neighborhood cares. Gotta move out to the sticks\n\nYou have far greater distance between your neighbors than I do my neighbors. My entire house is 3/8-1/4 acre and fences under 6 feet by HOA so they can easily see my plant in my very well planted garden from their second floor since my property is maybe 60-ft wide at most\n \nI'd fucking kill for rainfall and property like you have but I'm southwest in the desert so that means more water and digging a well and living out of a double wide here\n\nThis is essentially what happened. It's technically legal here now too but people of a ...uh... certain political affiliation... still act like it isn't.\n\n *whispers* the pot plants are in the basement. 🤭\n\nI have a neighbor (police won't tell me who) that calls the police on me when they think I'm not mowing my lawn often enough. \n\nThey ask for a wellness check because they \"haven't seen me for a while and my lawn is overgrown\".\n\nI’d like to believe they’re genuinely concerned. I’d like to, but I don’t. They’re justifying boorish behavior.\n\ntry not mowing just one section of your lawn at a time, and see which view earns you a visit.\n\nNot a plant, but a few years ago we were doing some landscaping in the backyard and it was cheaper to have a truckload of soil dropped off than buy individual bags. So we were in the yard working and a police officer walks up to our fence asking to speak to us. Turns out our neighbor had called and complained that we had a 4 ft tall pile of dog shit in our backyard and she was afraid it would leak into her yard when it rained! We all had a good laugh about it but it was wild that this lady saw a pile of soil and assumed that with two dogs we had accumulated a literally truckload of poop!\n\nIt's even funnyer knowing how tomato plants, even when not bearing fruits, smell TOMATO so much !\n\nTook me a bit to get it.  LOL!! Yes, your mama is definitely a kingpin drug dealer in town, LOL!! Some people are just insane.\n\nIt’s crazy they didn’t even notice the meth lab in the shed back there\n\nIt wasn't mentioned in the warrant.  Sorry.\n\nHere I am after 1 year of gardening, still triple checking EVERYTHING with my plant ID app, but marble-brain over here feels great enough about his plant ID skills to confidently call the cops on his neighbor.\n\nI have a Japanese Maple people think is weed every now and then. I've been stone cold sober every day of my life and my side profits come from selling native seeds and plants.\n\nShe has a spice shaker lid on her watering can. She’s a genius\n\nShe’s the type of leader we need. Innovative, resourceful, uses seasonings.\n\nThe beer tops it all off lol\n\nLooks like a Yeungling Black and Tan\n\nI was going to say yeungling for the win!\n\nHave you seen Weeds...clearly this lady is the next Nancy Botwin!\n\nMore like https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownie_Mary\n\nBeer can in one hand, watering can in the other. My kind of lady.\n\nI aspire to be her when I grow up! What. A. GAL.\n\nwow!  some people are really like that huh?  did the police have the caller fill out a victim statement?  must have been terrible stuff.  one can only imagine the suffering.\n\nI had a False Aralia on the at my Mom's house. I came out one day to find it had been burned the day after my neighbor told me to get rid of my Cannabis plant. I told him I didn't grow cannabis and he just rolled his eyes and walked away. The next day, I came out to find it burned in the driveway the next afternoon. Luckily, I had propogated a bunch of stem cuttings, but my mother plant was so glorious and I was really upset. It was the first plant I'd ever bought with my own money. I called the non-emergency line and reported that I thought my neighbor trespassed in my backyard and set one of my houseplants on fire. They sent someone to my house, and then the officer went to the neighbors house. I could hear his answer because I was out front with another cop. My neighbor didn't deny it. He said \"Hell yeah, I did. She was growing drugs. Stupid skank was robably gonna sell it to the kids around here and poison the neighborhood.\" So the cop took one of my cuttings over and asked if it looked like the Marijuana he burned. My neighbor said yes. The cop's response was great. \"Sir, if you don't know what cannabis looks like, don't burn it. This isn't cannabis. This is False Aralia, not even related. It is a houseplant, not a drug. Also, it is legal in this state to grow Cannabis, indoor or out.\" and my neighbor got slapped with fines. But I still miss that plant, though.\n\nGlad they got fined. What a pain in the ass. Why can’t people just mind their own fucking business?\n\nBecause if they stop and look internally, they can’t stand what they see. You have to turn the hatred outward if looking inward is too awful.\n\nI bet they smoked once and got a look into their internal world and therefore *realized* the plant was filled with negativity, hate, pain and confusion... when all along they saw their Self.\n\nI stand be my theory that this is what most people's \"bad trips\" are\n\nThat makes sense to me. I have PTSD and a cheap date when it comes to weed. I stay well clear of it for good reason.\n\nI’m really fascinated by weed and PTSD- I have C-PTSD and it has helped so much. However, others, like you, are often negatively affected. It makes me wonder why it affects some of us positively and others negatively. Some strains of THC calm the amygdala, which is the part of the brain most affected by THC. That said, I do have an easier time accessing my emotions and it can be really intense when I do- it’s good to have a close and trusted person that I can talk my feelings out with when that happens.\n\nI think it’s one of the things like “fight, flight, or freeze”. At least one of those options is the best choice for a surprise situation so animals, including humans, are shotgunned randomly with one as a preprogrammed response. I think it gets piled on to for higher emotion creatures like humans. Lot more to it then that, environment and such, but it’s a starting place.\n\nI have C-PTSD and this is almost exactly my experience with it and accessing emotions. After about six months of EMDR, I decided to start doing it high over summer break….. and that shit became next level. Very significant trauma reprocessing. I am super grateful to have cannabis as a therapy tool.\n\nAs someone who had a bad trip...I honestly thought that was the understood meaning of a bad trip.\n\nThat shit hurt.\n\nI totally agree. When people are curious about psychedelics I warn, if your mental den is not well kept, you will most likely have a bad trip. You must take care of your garden, as this is where you will spend your time tripping.\n\nMan, I hate myself too but I just like started growing vegetables instead to distract myself from the constant ache of living.\n\n*exhales smoke* *cough* duuuude\n\nI think I’m more impressed the cop knew the name of the plant.  I’ve lived my life surrounded by landscapers and horticulturalists and they are only just starting to stick.\n\nWell, I told them what it was and they compared photos they had of cannabis to the False Aralia I had, bc protocol, and were basically like \"I didn't need to know what False Aralia was to know it wasn't cannabis.\"\n\nBecause nothing hits quite like acting on \"righteous\" anger. Imagine how good it would feel to punch a nazi in the face. That's the high they're chasing, even if they have to sacrifice their common sense to get it.\n\nWe tend to believe that others act from the same motivations as ourselves, and are as truthful (or not) as we are. \n\nSomeone who believes everyone around them is hateful and up to no good . . .\n\nBecause humans are assholes I guess LOL 😂\n\nExactly! If it’s not hurting anybody leave it alone!\n\nPleasantly shocked that police actually handed out justice in your case.\n\nThe cops in that area are good guys. Every time I see the 2 Thst helped me that day, they ask how my weed is doing 😂\n\nBurning doesn’t seem like the brightest way to get rid of a pot plant lmao\n\nFunny, it seems to be the preferred method of most of the cannabis enthusiasts I know!\n\nCatastrophically destroyed in a series of small fires.  RIP.\n\nIn a legal state?! I’ve had neighbors check on my actual weed plants before. Living next to trashy people is the worst.\n\nYep. It was legal where I was. You could grow it in or out, both perfectly legal. And he didn't even burn a weed plant. I bought the False Aralia from a friend who inherited it from their grandmother and he wasn't good with plants. Sadly, all the cuttings were promised to members of his family. I didn't get to keep a single one.\n\nWait what? Why not? That’s wild!\n\nI only took enough cuttings to supply the planty people that wanted a memorial piece for their beloved family member. I wanted to keep the Mother Plant super glorious and the Mother Plant was the one burned.\n\nAny chance of get a new cutting from one of theirs? 😁\n\nEdit: oops I see it was 13 years ago 🤣\n\nSadly, no. I didn't know any of them and I don't live there now.\n\nThis is awesome! Finally a little satisfaction for once... I'm sorry about the mother plant, but it's so delicious to hear your fuck-wad neighbor getting schooled by the cops!\n\nIt was pretty great 😂\n\nI think there’s a whole threes company episode where they think mrs roper is growing weed but it was false aralia\n\nA misunderstanding leading to chaos and hilarity on Three's Company?? Say it ain't so!\n\nMan I haven't watched it in like 30 years! It was on of my fav shows as a kid. I should sail the seas to find some episodes.\n\nLMAO imma have to watch that one.\n\nShould have got slapped with an arson charge.\n\nArson, trespassing, destruction of property.\n\nNext, You should park an RV in your driveway and put on a gas mask before you go in it.\n\nHAHAHAHA I don't live there anymore but that would have been funny\n\nIf i had your neighbour he might wake up to all of his wondows mysteriously covered in paint....\n\nIf weed is so bad, why would you burn it!? To give the whole neighborhood a nice high? Totally illogical! LOL!\n\nThis ending was so satisfying, would’ve been that much more satisfying if u started growing cannabis the following year 😂😂😂\n\nI couldn't have because I was 16 when this happened XD\n\nI just read your post to my husband and he wants your neighbor arrested!\n\nLOL! It was 13 years ago.\n\nYou should sue him in small claims court for the cost of the plant\n\nI was 16 at the time.\n\nAnd he was calling you a “stupid skank”? What a scumbag. If someone said that to my daughter I’d be fuming, or any girl for that matter!\n\nYeah, he was so rude.\n\nYears ago a friend of mine had her house searched because the neighbors reported the grow lights in her basement where her husband had his tomato starts, some people aren't busy enough\n\nI would file a complaint. Grow lights are not probable cause to search a house.\n\nYeah when has that ever stopped pigs tho\n\nThis is exactly the conversation I had in my head that lead to cardboard on the basement windows. Man if I was growing drugs I'd at least sell some and fix the place up. \n\nThat’s a damn shame, loved the little bit of extra natural light my pepper starts got when the sun was shining in on them through the windows of the basement at the old house I used to rent.\n\n[Police when they receive the complaint.](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/5a/34/21/5a34216b3ecd18caca9a2c25f2bed139.gif)\n\nI've been waiting for some idiot to call about the grow light in out upstairs bathroom. African violets need humidity and with two people who thrive on hot showers, it's the best room for them in the house.\n\nWhat the fuck is wrong with people they’ll literally call the police before talking to their neighbors. Unbelievable. Yet so common\n\nI just had a recent experience with asshats like that. My child was vomiting in the car. We were 30 seconds from home and on a residential street. The street isn’t wide enough for me to pull to the side and not impede traffic/get hit by someone on their phone so I pulled into someone’s driveway apron and was helping my child who was vomiting/choking. I have a soccer mom van and I’m short-I’m the furthest thing from threatening. This neighbor decided to run outside her home to stand, stare, and call the cops and give them my description. Because apparently I was there to rob her at 9:30am 🙄\n\nYeah the sick kid is about to do a home invasion, better call in the SWAT team 🤦🏻‍♀️\n\nNo kidding. \n\n\"Did you see someone growing weed in their backyard? Because no, you didn't.\"\n\nYour mom‘s overalls are adorable! If you want to antagonize that neighbor, here’s a few more look-a-like plants to grow next… 😈\n\n1. Coralbush (*Jatropha multifida*) PICTURED\n2. Cassava (*Manihot esculenta*)\n3. Kenaf (*Hibiscus cannabinus*)\n4. Hemp Agrimony (Eupatorium cannabinum\\*)\n5. Texas Star Hibiscus (Hibiscus coccineus\\*)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z184ghk0kvkd1.jpeg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=00c0fdd9a4b7fdd868bb41c34f0d3f19b32bd20e\n\nYes, OP please troll the fuck out of this neighbor now\n\nMight as well throw some [okra](https://time.com/3479728/marijuana-okra-police/) in there too.\n\nYes! We have 18 okra plants and my neighbor (who is amazing and I think was hoping it was weed lol) wandered over when we when watering to ask what we were growing heehee\n\nWhen in a few months after the police have been over for every look a like, she’ll be in the clear to grow the real thing as the cops won’t turn up again!\n\nThe Florida Cranberry/Jamaican Sorrel plant is in the okra family w similar leaves… and makes the most beautiful flowers… for ones who are looking for “similar looking” to annoy neighbors like OPs?\n\nI grow it every year and prior to flowering I always kinda wonder what my neighbors think I’m “really” growing!\n\nI love this. I love your mom. I love that image of her. Reminds me of my own mom so much it nearly makes me cry 😭\n\nRight? Idk where you or OP are but she’s got huge PNW mom energy lol\n\nThe yuengling in her hand makes me guess PA\n\nOh shit, didn't even notice the yuengling! Don't think it's PA tho, OP mentioned elsewhere pots legal to grow there. We're not that lucky yet. Very likely to be east coast, as it can be tougher to find west of the Mississippi (or at least it used to be).\n\nEven in a legal state, people get harassed for growing. Makes me want to plant an entire hedge of it around my property lines 😂🌴\n\nA lot of homegrow laws unfortunately state that you’re supposed to keep them from public view\n\n if that was weed the deers would've eaten it by now. They love it.\n\nAnd they hate cleome\n\nAnd tigers hate pepper, they love cinnamon.\n\nThis is now my favorite deer fact\n\nbloodshot eyed deer staring at the cleome plant, sighing deeply\n\nDid they think it was weed? Cause honestly... it doesn’t look like weed. (But I guess maybe to someone who knows absolutely nothing about plants... it might.)\n\nYour mom looks more than happy to talk about her garden with the cops.\n\nEdit: Fixed typo\n\nI didnt know what cleome looked like, so I looked it up, and I could see the resemblance. It wouldn't look the same if you looked up a picture of pot and compared it, but like if you saw pot once 20 years ago and had a vague recollection of it, you could maybe construe cleome to look the same. \n\nNow calling the cops without verification is absolutely out of pocket. I guess if you thought having \"what does a pot plant look like\" in your browser history would cause the rabies infested paw patrol to show up and tear your trachea out, you might not check.\n\nBlack &amp; Tan??? \n\nAnd what a waste of municipal resources. Must be an uneventful day if they actually sent someone out to check up on it! Not to mention it must be a slow day for the AH neighbor too.\n\n[removed]\n\nYour mom looks like an amazing gardener and rad person. WTAF is wrong with her neighbor.\n\nI like that your mom’s drinking a beer while talking to the cops! Like, “bitch get dafuq outta here, I’m gardening!”\n\nI see your mom comes with the standard gardener's overalls.  The only other item that would make this pic look more \"seed catalog,\" is this hat.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wcquolwbkvkd1.jpeg?width=679&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a58076992446dd6c40fd28b73e6c019bfbff2cc3\n\nYa’ll live in the wrong state! My cleome doing well also.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cr19q11bkvkd1.jpeg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=554abbfeef329c6f1aa8a4746b58d97ceb29799e\n\nOh no you didn't! I'm calling the cops!!!\n\nI had a huge one in a pot in my backyard. After some strange kid opened up my gate and came into my backyard to inspect it, I found out one of our kids was telling people I was growing pot. I immediately brought out my plant guide and showed them. \n\nGet some hemp seeds and sow them all over the neighbor's yard.\n\nLol, I would plant as many look-alikes as I could just as a hobby. Cleome, check, green cutleaf Japanese maples, check, cassava, lupins, check and check! Sulphur cinqfoil and some lupins for good measure .... You get the idea\n\nI'd then follow up your idea with things like brugmansia, San Pedro cactus, mimosa and passion flower. Might as well grow the legal plants of illegal drugs.\n\nMight as well add straight up papaver somniferum to the list. Growing opium poppies is fine as long as you don’t score them.\n\nOh, people are so amazing.  The week I got my greenhouse installed, my neighbor across the street ambled over as I was checking the mail to ask, “what you got growin’ in there??” and was deeply unsatisfied by my answer of just fall lettuce at the moment.  \n\nI went on to say I still need to get it set up properly, describing my plans, and of course he brought the topic back around to my “grow operation.”  “Any marijuana going in there?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Arrr- OKAY.” He just huffs and walks away shaking his head.  BYE DUDE\n\nSome people are just weird. I guess he really wants to feel like some kind of “hero” or something by defeating the evil plants.\n\nSounded to me like he was looking for a free handout! Haha\n\nMy neighbors complained to my landlord when my husband and I bought a massive pachira plant and brought it into our apartment.\n\nThey thought it was Marijuana \n\nI hate people\n\nWe could be friends😎 I’ll hold your beer while you talk to the cops.\n\nlol your mom is awesome (her neighbor is not)\n\nCleome truly looks nothing like marijuana. Sure, they have pointy leafs, but so do a zillion other plants. Ultimately the differences are too big. \n\nYour poor mom, also, cops have nothing else to do?\n\nThat great big white dot in the middle of the palm of the palmate leafs lets you know it's not marijuana it's that pretty flower your grandma grows. LOL. I think every cop knows that since they are taught how to identify controlled substances and that's still illegal in some states\n\nDrinking a lager while talking to the cops investigating your supposed weed plant is legendary. If I were her neighbor i’d invite her over to my porch for a couple of bong rips after they left.\n\nI wish she was my neighbor.\n\nthe amount of hatred i feel for people like this - calling the freaking police to narc on someone else’s garden - is borderline unhealthy.\n\nlike it’s such a hater move, i can’t even fathom what pathetic type of life this loser has that they will call the POLICE, who KILL PEOPLE SOMETIMES, over a freaking plant that’s not even theirs?! also even if it was pot, who gives a shit. if the neighbor is polite and minds their business how does it affect anyone’s life whatsoever. \n\ndrop their address so we can all send them glitter bombs or boxes of poop or something. or make a gofundme for the local teens to toilet paper their house.\n\nAre we talking about the little plant in the corner of the box? Even if it was cannabis, (I’m assuming that’s what the issue here was) the fact that someone would call the police over that is unbelievable. Like that plant is disrupting the neighbors and affecting the neighborhood somehow. Haha! Come look in my yard neighbor!\n\nWait until the cleome flowers.  It's very clearly not what they think it is 😂\n\nI aspire to this level of chill. A gardener enjoying some sunshine, a cold one, and some lovely plants!\n\nI was renting next door to a woman who had beautiful wisteria and I left it grow all over my property. My landlord after we moved out cut down all the plants on our part. She sued his balls off and won!\n\nDon't let her plant Texas star, the whole.swat team might show up. 🤣🤣🤣\n\nDamn those overalls are cool as hell and she wears them well. What a cool mom you have!! 💗\n\nI don't know what cleome is. Does it look like marijuana or something?\n\nYes. It's growing at the base of the planter.\n\nit also smells like marijuana. and the two plants aren't related at all!\n\nJudge for yourself.  I believe it's right there in the lower left corner of the image.\n\nLegend 👏👏👏\n\nShe looks very.... relaxed.\n\nYuengling in one hand and watering can in the other. Great picture and something to talk about for years to come. Your mom is awesome!\n\nWhen I was a teenager there were very few pictures of marijuana around, but I thought I knew what it looked like.  So I was really surprised to find it growing in Mom’s garden.  Didn’t say anything but watched it closely (thinking I might harvest some for myself). Eventually I realized it was… okra.\n\nGive your mom a hug from us all\n\nI had a cop follow me home from a hydroponics shop many years ago. They came snooping around my windows a bit after I got home. I was trying to grow some tomatos and herbs in an aquaponics setup in my living room 😢\n\nThe silly things people do when they see a palmate leaf 🍃\n\nYour mom’s zen level cool is legendary. May she life a long and healthy life to plant more cleomes.\n\nI live in Oregon, and this is wild to me. Totally legal to grow plants here in your yard. I would lose it, if someone called the cops because of a plant. People need hobbies. Also, your mom is adorable.\n\nLOL this was my first year planting cleome and I absolutely did a double take when I saw the foliage. Calling the cops is pretty extreme! Glad everything worked out.\n\nGlad Virginia legalized marijuana, up to four plants. Two of mine are 12’ tall now.\n\nThis reminds me of a time I went shopping at a big chain store. Someone had this plant in checkout in front of me, saw me glance at it, and then turned around to me and started panic-explaining lol. I wanted to be like, “ma’am, I don’t think Walmart would sell weed”, but I just smiled and nodded. It was an adorable interaction\n\nI just came here to say you’re mother looks adorable and I can tell from her picture she has a beautiful soul.\n\nI hope this all gets worked out peacefully! ✌️\n\nAs soon as the cops saw your mom, they should have realized she was a serious gardner- your photo looks like she could be an extra from a plant catalog with her watering can and denims !\n\nSome people just can’t stand/seen happiness… I’m sorry you got some bitter neighbors. Your moms looks/shines with amazing vibe tho! 😊👍\n\nI would totally get stoned with your mom though\n\nDark ying….your mom is classy as fuck and I hope you treat her well\n\nWe must protect your mom at all costs.\nShe looks like she takes in 'stray' people and makes them family.\n\nEven the watering can is laughing at the absurdity.\n\nQueen.\n\nShe looks extremely dangerous. Probably a drug cartel kingpin. There’s no mercy in her.\n\nGlad we have vigilant neighbors who are brave enough to report this sort of criminality. I hope they go into witness protection.\n\nYup. I started a garden at my kids’ school. Sometimes I would plant cleome in the center of each raised bed. A few different parents questioned me over the years. One was insistent and took it to the principal! \nThe kids loved cleome. They called them the fireworks flowers. :)\n\nMy mom had some and there was a cop down the road just parked. He finally got up the courage to come on the property- my dad , a big gruff looking mountain man, asked what was going on. \n\"You know what that plant is?\"\n\"One of my wife's flowers\"\n'Are you sure?\" \nMom comes out \n\"I got those from a lady I work with.\" She reaches over and pops a seed pod to show the cop it's not what he thought.\n\nOne time I did a ride-along for meals on wheels and somebody commented to me that one of the recipients had a big grow op on his secluded property, which wasn't visible from the public road. When we turned around the bend in his driveway, there were rows and rows of irrigated potted bamboo. He said he sold them to a landscaping company.\n\nOk please tell her that instead of buying a new watering can, I’m also going to replace the nozzle with a shaker cap. Freakin genius!\n\nWhat a great picture. I wish somebody would take a picture like this of me. It captures so much of her!\n\nits funny but it is also infuriating. An older person might have really been upset by a visit from the police. As future VP Walz says Mind your own damn business!\n\nMy grandmother had a 5’x5’ bed of cleome in the back yard when her daughter (my aunt) got engaged to the sheriff’s son. Grandma invited the groom-to-be and his family for dinner and the sheriff saw the flowerbed and about lost his mind. Started ripping the plants up by the handful. Grandpa said, “Oh Jerry, you’re in trouble now!” while laughing his ass off. Grandma shouted, “Jerry have you lost your goddamn mind?! I’m gonna kick your ass from here to town if you don’t get out of that flowerbed right now!” Jerry said, “Evelyn, you can’t be growing marijuana, I’m the sheriff!” Grandma said, “no, what you are is a dumbass!”\n\nI bet the cops loved your sweet mama almost as much as I do!  She reminds me of my own. 🤗💔\n\nSmells like marijuana, also.\n\nYour mom has the best aura!\n\nI have oodles of cleome and let them as big as they wanna be!\n\nI hope I turn in to your mom when I’m older. She looks like a cool lady to hang with"

I'm heading there now.\n\nI've seen you!\n\nHe has a great channel\n\nNot sure about your laws on this, but grow some hemp plants if you want/are able to. Hemp is very good at pulling anything out of the ground that you dont want in your veggies. It can make the land less fertile, but you can enrich the soil pretty cheap with natural products (usually dont need to)\n\nThis pulls any heavy metals pesticides etc into the hemp plants. Cut them before they fully mature, dry and burn. Dont let the hemp degrade back into the soil as anything they pulled will go back in. \n\nYou can get a 100 pack of hemp seeds for like $5-30 over the internet in the US, most of these places ship to Canada too.\n\nYou are living my dream with this post, I have always wished I had my own spot to do work like that\n\nAnd you are a Disney Princess, too!\n\nYou did a beautiful job!

Great work\n\nLol I like that one 😂, thank you\n\nI thought it was a duck at first too, but its a chipmunk.\n\nlol pic 4 is the one I meant 😂\n\nSeriously this guy is borderline magical\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t7dzwdgtu5ad1.jpeg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eea4f1e8f6f1c8a8eaafc42de063bdbac323c0ca\n\nMagic in the garden\n\nOh my gosh that pic deserves to be in a children’s book haha!\n\n🤣 the look on the mother birds face is so funny\n\nShe feels violated 😆😆😆\n\nI forgot to knock before I enter 😂\n\n🤣🤣🤣\n\n👁️ 👄 👁️\n\nBasically all mouth and eyes 😂, I thought they were so ugly lol I can’t even lie\n\nAs long as their momma love them that’s all that counts 😂\n\nBrother, YOU ARE magic. Incredible, beautiful work.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v3vpzxd9u5ad1.jpeg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f54709a8d0a83c391dc9a638392ab423a468697\n\nChickadee had babies in the garden\n\nwhole imagine hungry practice tidy encourage library rhythm cough spotted\n\n *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev/home)*\n\nYou are so right they got rid of all the annoying caterpillars, I loved the little chickadee for that\n\nSoon you will have an army!\n\n\nCan I ask what if any defense you are using against chipmunks? \n\n\nI'm in a similar climate to you and they absolutely devour everything, even dug up the bulbs I planted &amp; ate them.\n\n\nAlso do you have wood rats?\n\n\nIf so, watch out for those guys in the late summer/fall, they will take down entire plants to build their winter nest.\n\nLol I think I already started an army 😂, and honestly they chipmunks are not bad, and I think it’s because I feed them, this year was the first time they ever ate corn out my garden but it was only 1 and she had babies so I figure she was just eating anything, once my plants grow they never touch them maybe lose a few tomatoes and strawberries but that’s about it,\n\nAnd no wood rats were I live my only two competition is fox and skunks but I have two dogs ! That helps a lot.\n\nHow are you making me even more envious?! Don’t tell me you magically raise unicorns also?! Amazing job 😍\n\nLol no unicorns yet, still seeing if I can get a two for 1 deal lol 😂 jokes but I do have ducks, chickens, birds and chipmunks\n\n🥹🥹🥹\n\nFirst of all, amazing job with your garden! Second, thank you for sharing the bird pictures - I have a chickadee-obsessed daughter who was so excited when I showed her your pictures. You’re a steward of the land!\n\nThank you appreciate the kind words, and that’s awesome glad you were able to share this, I will share more ❤️ love showing kids the bond we can have with animals if we just show them love and lots of FOOD 😂\n\nAwesome! And so awesome to get pics of yourself doing what you love!\n\nThank you, and ye I always take picture just to have that moment captured it’s unbelievable sometimes lol.\n\nWOW   O    O  &lt;3\n\nThat's *very* impressive! \n\nSo.much.work\n\nSo.much.dedication\n\nYou're a Nature Wizard :D 💚🌱\n\nThank you so much, nature is wizard lol I like it 😂\n\nOh yeah, you're charismatic enough to pull it gracefully:\n\nyou'd be very cool *and* powerful\n\n😌👌💚🌱\n\n[deleted]\n\nThank you appreciate it 😊\n\nMan, that's awesome. Very inspiring. Keep up the good work.\n\nI appreciate it friend, we can do anything in life it just takes time and little by little.\n\nCongrats! You must have worked really hard\n\nThanks and ye 4 years I normally start in April and at it till October. I do take breaks but that’s the time I normally work in the yard.\n\nWhat do you do for money if you dont mind me asking?\n\nMe I do a lot, I sell food on the side sometimes, I do car detailing but I work full time as a water plant operator.\n\nI can only imagine how much hard work, determination and research you put into this.  3b is a far cry from the Caribbean. Its a masterpiece. The chickadee eating sunflower seeds from your hand is just precious.\n\nYe 4 years and I normally start in April all the way to October and lol ye complete different climate that’s for sure 😂, sometimes I have to remember I’m not in Jamaica, but I like the challenge and like u sed research helps big time ! And ye I love those little birds one of them had babies, in the nesting box on my garden\n\nimg\n\nSitting in the greenhouse watching plants grow is #goals\n\nThanks who would imagine 😂\n\nHaha I saw that photo and I could absolutely relate. Sitting there and think that you can will them into growing faster😁\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0siz2wyju5ad1.jpeg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4994ca72816f600ff0e7cd35626c2bcf347bbe24\n\nThat's amazing op! That must've been a lot of work but it is worth it. Your vegetables look awesome... Good soil makes all the difference.\n\n And that chipmunk is so cute- he thinks he's your best friend.😆 Jealous- I've never had a chipmunk eat out of my hand before.🥺\n\nThank you ! And ye it was a lot of work but as I saw more progress I wanted to keep doing more , it motivated me , ye good soil does make a major difference I had to buy it little by little, and that way it gave me time to work it into the land, \n\nAnd I do have a chipmunk Bestfriend she’s lived here 4 years and all these other chipmunks they are her babies ! And if u do u would love it , there really cool and friendly.\n\nYou are truly a model and an inspiration that it is possible. I always think of how my mom would tell me Bangalore in India was as on a plateau and cool and known to be green. In recent years it has all been cut down and the city is hot. Centuries ago a king actually did a lot of planting and made the arid area cool and lush and modified the characteristics of the climate. It can be done. Sad that it has been undone in recent years, but I feel like your personal effort shows that huge change is possible and reminded me of that. I’m from Canada too and I’m so impressed!\n\nThank you so much brother I appreciate that , and it’s very unfortunate because of greed at time, and you are right so much can be done and how I thought about it, if we each play just a small role together we can all make a big impact, no matter how small 😊🌱❤️, and much respect again from northern Ontario timmins !\n\nI'm from Bangalore too and remember how green and cool it was in the 80s and 90s. My parents' house is like a mini jungle even now so I'm trying to replicate that at my current house. 😃\n\nDamn that is impressive. Enjoy your bountiful harvest.\n\nThank you !\n\nwow,keep up the good work!\n\nThank you and always every year I’m at it !\n\nBeautiful! I wish I could get onions that big, I haven't figured them out yet.\n\nThank you, and depending on your winter, I find I get big onions the ones that survive over winter and take back again the following year.\n\nAnd good fertilizer!\n\nLots of fertilizer and water is the way of the onion\n\nMay I ask what inspired you to move to Canada from Jamaica? Beautiful garden work, man!\n\nMy dad was in Canada I was living in Jamaica with my mom, and my dad filled for me in 2009\n\nFellow Canadian here!! Love your garden 🪴 \nMay I ask what province you’re in?!\n\nEdit sorry just read the post description and saw you’re in ON. I’m out west on Vancouver Island\n\nYa mon, knocking it out of the park.\n\nYa Mon str8 home run 🏃\n\nSand to grassland reminds me of one of my favorite environmental books, Sand County Almanac by Aldo Leopold. It's short and would be a lovely read while spending a morning sitting in the garden.\n\nI’ll definitely give it a look, I thought of starting to paint as I wait for the harvest but reading also good!\n\nWow!! I can tell this was a lot of hard work but well worth it! Amazing space you’ve created\n\nThank you and ye 4 years later but this year feels like it finally coming together, was well worth it !\n\nYou basically terraformed your backyard! No small feat, I'm super impressed!

What a great job of transforming that place.  Lots of work.  Excellent results too.  Be proud.\n\nThank you, and I love it when friends and family come by and get to enjoy it to, and seeing the different animals that come by also !\n\nLOL that picture of you sitting in the greenhouse looks like you're in there just waiting for them to grow and start up a conversation with you. Dope garden, man.\n\nLol I was sitting in there telling them they better grow , because ain’t no plant getting fed for free around here 😂 jokes , and thank you friend appreciate it !\n\nHolding those onions so triumphantly, i know that felt good.\n\nLol yup I was yelling victory ✊🏾😂\n\nGod I love this so much ♥️\n\nOHMYGAWD, look at those heirloom tomatoes!!!\n\nAmazing!!!!!\n\nThank you\n\nI wish I lived next door to you. This is amazing.\n\nAmazing! Wow, thanks for sharing!\n\nNo prob 😊\n\nFn beautiful my friend. I wanna see a long form video about this process. If you have clips, put it together for us! Call it \"The Blackyardigan\"\n\nLol you gave me a good laugh with that one I’m writing it down too I actually love that name!

Fry, is that you?\n\n[deleted]\n\nShelob.\n\nMy daughter brought home a drawing of our house she'd done at school. There was an odd shape in the house's attic. She said it was a spider.\n\nSeriously. It's awesome, but I was so disappointed when there were no interior pics.\n\nGrandparent goals.\n\nSure, for the “grandkids.”  You’re not fooling me.\n\nCan you be my grandparent?\n\nAs a grandparent myself, I also want you to be my grandparent. I mean, mine are all gone now so I could use one. And a hobbit hole would be nice, too.\n\nA hobbit hole with a liquor cabinet and humidor, if it's not asking too much? 😇\n\nAnd is there a ~~minimum~~ maximum age for someone to be your grand kid? Like in your 30s or so...\n\nI still had grandparents in my 50s\n Depends on genetics, luck, and tight generational intervals.\n\nYes. Where is the application to be your grandkid?\n\nLiterally was just about to type this too 😂\n\nCame here to ask the same\n\nI also came to ask this. 😂\n\nYou cant upload this and not post interior pics! This is lovely!\n\nOh good point!! Please do show us inside\n\nThis just made me completely rethink the hill we have in our backyard!\n\nMade me think about making a hill in mine..\n\nHoney, I need lots of dirt!\n\nI have a pretty good sized hill too! Except it is currently hosting a chipmunk\n\nTime for an eviction!\n\nINSIDE! INSIDE! INSIDE!\n\nI can move in next Tuesday.❤️\n\nSee you next Tuesday!\n\nI'll be there Wednesday.\n\nNew Airbnb listing; $400/night for niche hobbit hole experience\n\nOH MY GOD this is spectacular! I hope your grandkids treasure it!\n\nYou could rent this for $1200 a month\n\nMan, what a great idea for themed cabins in the woods.\n\nHOBBIT town. Juet need the land and investors. Hit me up! lol\n\nYou could have themed Hobbit conventions! HobbitCon!\n\nYou mean per weekend, right?\n\nWhaaaat?? Omg I love this more than words can describe. Been a huge Tolkien fan since I was a kid\n\nYOU ARE AMAZING. \nI’m 38, and my grandparents have all passed. Please adopt me also as your grandchild. :) \nI come with 3 children. ❤️\n\nIn all seriousness, this is wonderful and your family is blessed with your kindness, skilled work, and creativity!!\n\nI’d be smoking in there nonstop\n\nWhat do you think the chimneys for\n\n[removed]\n\nWhat has it got in its insideses?\n\nAmazing\n\nHow safe is it? Not to be a Debbie downer but pic 2 is a little rough from a construction perspective. Just looking out for your grand babies.\n\nI'm hoping that big wall of dirt was stabilized somehow.\n\nI was also hoping for more in progress pics to see the safety shoring...\n\nYeah, I shudder to think what the soil and turf on the roof weighs after a rain... One pallet of sod is 1500-3000 lbs, so I'd wager close to a tonne (2000 lbs). This isn't accounting for lateral forces from the side.\n\nOP, if you aren't an engineer or architect, and haven't constructed with the intent of supporting that kind of mass, please don't let anyone inside...\n\nAnd then an adult has to walk across it to mow as well. And i’m imagining he’s going to fall through with the joist spacing if it doesn’t just collapse. I’m so nervous. It does look like OP knows what he’s doing from the completed structure, but that progress shot sent up a field of red flags\n\nI was very confused that this wasn't top comment until I realized this is r/gardening not /r/DIY. I'm no geotechnical engineer but I highly doubt this is up to code.\n\nI did a double-take, too. I'd be interested to see what they'd say over r/construction or r/carpentry.\n\nYeah, this is my concern too. Soil is heavy and if it’s not shored up properly those walls will collapse.\n\nRightly or wrongly. My local city council would have this demolished for structural safety concerns.\n\nthank you for sharing! didn’t expect such a smile opening reddit tonight.\n\nThat is so awesome, need to see the inside\n\nHow much do you charge for adult homes?\n\nCan I be one of your grandkids? Even if I’m 60?\n\nWow your backyard(im assuming) looks like heaven\n\nWill you please be my grandparents? Mine were all deceased and the one I had left was angry and french. No hobbit houses happen med in my life 😫😫😫😫😫😫😫\n\nBest grandparent ever. Can we get inside pics?\n\nWould you like to adopt another grandkid? I can offer myself, in my 30s, or my toddler, but I'm coming with him. Your pick.\n\nHi don’t mind me, just moving my stuff into your hobbit hole backyard…\n\nIn reality both me as a child and me as an adult LOVE THIS\n\nPLEASE can we see the inside, i am begging\n\nHi it's me your long lost grandkid. I trim bushes and, given enough hard lemonade, mow lawns.\n\nJoking aside, that looks so cute. Good job!\n\nI'm more impressed with how you made it look so good (plants and grass) before the kids were too old to enjoy it haha. What's the timeframe between the first and the last picture?\n\nThis guy knows how to grandpa\n\nThat's awesome\n\nSo precious! 😉\n\nThis is a dream! Absolutely beautiful craftsmanship. Your grand babies are so lucky. 🥺💕💕💕\n\nHang on; packing suitcase, right now.\n\nWow! I’m dying to see the inside! You are one awesome grandpa!!!!\n\nShut up! I need the design if you’re willing to share for other grandparents to use (aka my dad 😆)\n\nDo you need any 50-yo grandkids?\n\nAdopt me please. I'm past retirement age and have a steady income. My cats won't bother you, I swear.\n\nYou win the grandparents sweepstakes!\n\n❤️ 😍 💖  can we see the inside?!\n\nThis is so insanely awesome.\n\nYOU CANNOT JUST NOT SHOW THE INTERIOR\n\nThat’s a vibe and a half\n\nI’m ready to move in. What’s rent?\n\nYour lawn is beautiful 🤩\n\nHeck, I'm a grown man with no kids and I would love one of these in my backyard.\n\nUnique AirBnB, $1000/night\n\nMy wife is only 5'1\" and is in desperate need of a she shed when your grandkids outgrow it.\n\nLegendary\n\nWe need more grands like you! 💕\n\nCan I be your grandchild?\n\nPeak grandparenting.\n\nAka Gramp’s smoke spot.\n\nAbsolutely brilliant!\n\nOMG… that is awesome! Keep up the great work!\n\nThis is so cool.i wanna see the inside\n\nWhen does the rental open? 😛\n\nThose kids are lucky. When my grandpa retired for good, he used his boredom to make 3...interesting sheds in the backyard.\n\nWhat does it look like inside?\n\nGreat Job!\n\nAmazing.\n\n\"For the grandkids\" riiight ;-) 👍\n\nVery cool. I am sincerely impressed!\n\nI AM JEALOUS!!!!!\n\nSo creative and looks amazing.\n\nWow!! AmaZing!! 🪄✨️✨️🌞\n\nI love it!! Enchanting!! Well done!!!\n\ncuuuuute!!!!\n\nYou are a good grandparent.\n\nCan you be my grandparent?\n\nAaaaaannnd now this is on my bucket list.\n\nI hella wanna see the inside of that lil canton\n\nAnd when they grow out of it, that’s where you’ll store your pumpkins.\n\nInterior photos would be lovely 😊\n\nBless you 💗\nThis is truly a wonder and I know it will bring so much joy to your grandkids\n\nWay to commit to being a grandparent.\n\nThis is amazing and made me miss my grandparents\n\nHi it’s me your grandchild\n\nThis is so cool!! Those kids are going to be WOWed!!!!\n\nAmazeballs!\n\nIf you go in you have to put on a long white wig and beard.\n\nAre you kidding me?  That is awesome!  Great job.\n\nCan I come visit?

Can I volunteer to be your grandkid? Great job!\n\nAre you... Looking to adopt a mid-30s grandkid?\n\nThat's amazing. I love it.\n\nSorry can’t make it. Gotta mow the roof.\n\nLucky grandkids!!\n\nSuper awesome, but like everyone has said show interior.\n\nAre you adopting adults by any chance? Asking for a friend...\n\n✋I’ll take one!\n\nUpdate me when we get to see inside 😭😭\n\nOMG So sweet. Add a moon gate. They’re round and would look like a hobbit door. Make sure to get a sturdy one. I just purchased a Kinsman, heavy duty with 18” stakes.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ahr3s8644vld1.jpeg?width=1028&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aaceddaf349c071732505c59628bceafad255be0\n\nmay you please adopt me as your grandkid??? also would love to see the inside if/when it's done!!!!!! this is amazing!!!!!\n\nBe my grandparent please 😭\n\nYOU DID WHAT\n\nThat's amazing!! Well done #1 grandad⭐️\n\nI wanna see the inside!!\n\nMy grandma gave me pot brownies when i was 8… that was kind of cool ig\n\nAmazing job, that looks like a house any hobbit (or grandkid) would be happy to inhabit! Just a word of caution - it looks like you used cinder blocks for the walls and like it might not have great ventilation. You may want to put a carbon monoxide sensor in there, just to be safe.\n\nwowwwwww!\n\nI was like oh too bad it's for the grandkids I would love to smoke a pipe in there and then the last picture I was like 🗿🧙🏼‍♀️\n\nCan you adopt me?\n\nAbsolutely amazing!\n\nThis is the coolest thing ever, this will be a great core memory for them\n\nKilling it\n\nStop telling people or the city/county might get angry at you\n\nYou will be voted best grandparent\n\nJust wait til they start hot-boxing Longbottom Leaf in that b*tch.\n\nBeautiful!\n\nHow do you mow the roof?\n\nOh gosh how cute!\n\nA-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!!!!\n\nthis is awesome\n\nMy goodness this beautiful. So cosy looking.\n\nCan I come play?\n\nOmg! It would be so cute to have a little sleepover in there. So cute OP ♡\n\nQuestion: Are you taking adoption applications atm?\n\nThis is fantastic!! Lucky grandchildren :)\n\nHow much do you charge them a month?\n\nAmazing\n\nInside pics please. This is legit the coolest thing I've seen on this sub.

Just start with cutting the lowest branches and go from there. [Lady Cynthia Rhody](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/lady-cynthia-is-turning-heads-in-ladysmith-b-c-1.4144092)\n\nGetting the limbs off the ground is definitely a goal. It’ll make cleaning out inside and mowing the lawn easier\n\nDid you hear that Rhodo broke apart in a storm a few years ago? 😥\n\nYeah I saw that when I went searching for the link. What a bummer that rhody was huge.\n\nThere's another huge white one in the Keukenhoff Gardens outside Amsterdam.\n\nIf you ever have a chance to go, I 100% recommend!\n\nThe rhododendron I'm [talking about](https://x.com/visitkeukenhof/status/1783490320186888541)\n\nI live near that and whenever I have to drive by it I'm in absolute awe!! it honestly is so much more impressive in person\n\nWow!!! What an amazing Rhody!!!\n\n[removed]\n\nPlease tell me all of your secrets! I’m planning to buy my first house this coming year and intend on planting some rhododendron!\n\nStep 1: Buy a house with a 60 year old rhododendron \nStep 2: …Profit?\n\nSee how it’s planted on a slope? Rhododendrons love good drainage. They have shallow roots so leave the area around it free of grass and other plants that will compete with it. Make sure you buy the right one for your sun exposure. Some can take full sun, others need shade.\n\nOooh. That’s a good tip about sloping. Makes sense!\n\nFeed, deadhead, ericaceous \n\nThey aren't difficult plants, don't let them suffer drought conditions and they'll get big by themselves. They're a bit invasive over here\n\nhttps://www.rhs.org.uk/plants/rhododendron/growing-guide\n\nMiracle Gro makes a fertilizer specifically for rhododendrons. They love it. Use it spring and fall.\n\nNo secrets haha. When we moved in last December it was already this big and then it bloomed in the spring\n\nIt involved into a rhododendohodron!\n\nAka biblically accurate rhododendron\n\nMy god that's glorious!\n\n[removed]\n\n[removed]\n\nBeautiful😍\n\nAre you from Western Pa? That looks like Pittsburgh and the Rhododendrons grow like weeds there!!! It’s gorgeous\n\nI was also thinking this looks like PA! I'm in the central/Harrisburg area and it looks similar to a couple of the neighborhoods around here. \n\nAnd yes, the rhododendron are strong here, in the neighborhoods and in the wild. One of our favorite trails (Mill Creek Falls) is thick with rhododendron all around the waterfalls; it's so beautiful!\n\nThat definitely looks like a Pittsburgh neighborhood! I thought the same thing!\n\nI was thinking the same. We had a *beautiful* rhododendron season this year in particular.\n\nThat’s crazy, I’ve only been to Pittsburgh twice but I thought “that looks like where I stayed in Pittsburgh” 😂\n\n[removed]\n\nThat thing is amazing my lord\n\nAll hail the lord of Rhododendron!\n\nI won an 8th grade spelling bee because I remembered the “h” in rhododendron. \n\nYou clearly won the whole rhododendron jackpot altogether. Bravo!\n\nMinimal trimming is best, only remove damaged parts and remove just what overhangs the area you want free. \n\n\nYou can easily make it look bad by cutting unnecessarily trying to make it a certain shape. Best to just leave it as you can cut away years of growth in a few seconds. \n\nAs long as it's not intruding on a space you want to physically occupy, only remove the damaged or sick parts.\n\nI love the color and they’re so healthy\n\nI’m in awe. I’ve never seen anything like it. Congrats :)\n\nIT’S SO FLUFFY I’M GONNA DIEEE\n\nCan you go inside it? I really wanna put some chairs in there.\n\ngoals!\n\nDo it in very early spring before any sign of growth: cut the Rhodo a couple feet past the patio, so it looks like a laser sliced a wedge off the end. Then cut the edges of that new flat face so that it blends into the shape of the rest of the bush.\n\nI'm having a hard time describing. Imagine you have a potato with the end sliced off. Your goal now is to cut that potato so that it's potato-shaped again. Round the new edges off. Do that with the bush. Slice the end off and then make it bush-shaped again.\n\nBuy loppers and possibly pole-pruners and expect it to take several hours. Remember to step back frequently and see how the shape is coming along. \n\nExpect it to be bare for a year and not really fill in properly for a few years. You'll have to cut that side back once in a while too to keep it from growing too far again.\n\nI really appreciated your potato analogy\n\nWhat are you feeding that thing?! 😄\n\nFrom the looks of it - sacrificed virgins\n\nIt’s almost bigger than the house.\n\nHollow it out and charge rent. /s\n\nYou could have tea parties inside\n\nMy first thought was, wow, my seven year old self would have been hiding out in there all day long!\n\nHere, my 30 year old self is like 'you could have a whole secret club base in there!' But also 'wow, there's probably a lot of spiders in there!'\n\nThis belongs in r/absoluteunits\n\nGod damn  it needs it's own zip code\n\nWow Wee!\n\nThat is the biggest bee bush I have ever seen.\n\nMy inner child wants to make a secret fairy club underneath. Girls and gays only.\n\nRhododendron’s are the most common over planted shrub. I’ve pruned rather large specimens out in the field. From your picture, it almost looks as if someone deadheaded it seeing the blossoms are so abundant. \n\nAs much as 3 weeks or so of showy blossoms are great, the rest of the year is what is not being shown. \n\nMy first question for you, being a gardener from a foreign zone ( most likely ), what plant zone is this planted in? \n\nAs a general rule pruning back my more than a third is not recommended in the first year. Also, because the plant is dense a good look at the internal scaffolding is necessary. Pruning for air circulation is important. You’ll also notice debris and organic material forming like a forest floor underneath the canopy. Look for blackened stems and bark. Lack of air circulation can lead to fungal problems. \n\nI usually alternate my pruning on a shrub this size. And albeit the customer my say ‘ you cut away to much’ or it didn’t blossom well after you pruned it’ .. it depends on the time of year. Pruning it after blossoming is preferred. \n\nI’d much rather see the foliage. Is it healthy? Sun scorched? Has the winter sun been an issue? Do you feed it with anything? Or just leave it alone? Usually it’s an acid fertilizer. Morning sun afternoon shade but certain varieties of the larger leaf rhodies do well in ‘full sun’. Your specimen looks as if it enjoys its location however it doesn’t mean it shouldn’t be pruned.\n\nHoly shit.\n\nJust go \"no lawn\" and let it take over. Those bushes are incredible shelters for birds. The denser the better!\n\nI need this in my lifeike yesterday 😭\n\nBetter to tear down the house than to touch the rhododendron.\n\nYou can say I live near a big mountain of flowers😍\n\n\"Screw the house! We are moving into the rhododendron.\"\n\nComing from someone in zone 3, I am in complete awe. Those are spectacular. I’m so sad I can’t grow those.\n\nI'm in zone 10. Can't grow hardly anything. In fact it's second summer right now and Everything is burnt! 🥵😢\n\nWhoa!\n\nIm jelly. Its bigger than your house.\n\nIt’s lovely\n\nBeautiful\n\nIt has its own zip code!\n\nLooks like you have a rhodobehemoth on your hands\n\nHoly smokes!\n\nLord Rhodadendron\n\nI wish you could provide a closer look.\n\nIt's  as big as the house!\n\nI was going to say I need something there for scale. Then I saw the house\n\nGood grief!\n\nHoly flowers Batman!!!\n\nWow that is gorgeous!!\n\nWow👍👍\n\nrhododendrons will always remind me of my gram 💜 \n\nbeautiful, thank you for sharing\n\n…is this a ‘burb of Pittsburgh?\n\nTaking a wild guess that this is Pittsburgh lol\n\nPoor hostas and azalea?? feeling totally inadequate.\n\nThat thing is comically large. I love it!\n\nMother Goose!\n\nMy god that is beautiful!\n\nWooooow I love it\n\nIt looks like “The Blob” 😱\n\nLooks like a Dr. Suess book.\n\nit looks like it's going to eat your house\n\nUm.\n\namazing\n\nWhat does it look like in the colder months?\n\n“I know a good spot to spark up”\n\nWow!!!!!!!\n\nHas it started asking you to feed it bodies yet, because I think that's next Seymour!\n\nThat thing looks like it wants to eat the house lol.\n\nWhat a beauty….\n\nJesus christ\n\nStunning!!!\n\nOn steroids!\n\nNo Way! Congratulations 🎉\n\nNow you’re just bragging🤩\n\nGood lort!  Amazing!\n\nwhat a sight to behold\n\nIs this likely to be one rhodo, or was it like a bed of rhodos? I figured they had a terminal length much shorter than this. Do established ones send up suckers?\n\nWow! I have purchased 6 now and can't get ONE to grow!! I gave up. Lol This is absolutely stunning! 🥰🥰\n\nOhhhh lawrddd that’s massive! (And beautiful)\n\nThat is amazing.\n\nAs big as the house!\n\nIt’s bigger than the house!!\n\nOh my! I hate how much work the 4 are in front of my garage... I could never. 😂 But I'll also assume this doesn't get a whole lot of maintenance?\n\nWow! Incredible.\n\nAll the Rhodos I've had have struggled.  They live, but don't really thrive or grow.  I think I have mine in too much shade and the ground stays a bit too wet.\n\nRelease the deer! It’s lovely though!\n\nThis looks very Olyphant, Pa\n\nDo the bees love it?\n\nIt kind of looks like a Pokemon\n\nr/matureplants\n\nEven the air colors is beautiful\n\nAbsolutely stunnimg and the smaller azela in front gorgeous\n\nWow. This is incredible\n\nWow, looks out of this world\n\nThat’s amazing!\n\nThat is beautiful 😍😍\n\nWhy trim it? It is spectacular\n\nHow many is this? One massive one or a few next to each other?\n\nThat’s a Rhodo-WOW!! So impressive, I bet it was buzzing with activity.\n\nWow!How’d you do that!? She’s big, bold, and beautiful!\n\nJust missing one eye and and one horn\n\nWoooooow\n\nWowza\n\nWhat an absolute unit.\n\n😍😍😍\n\n Rhododendronominon!\n\nand not a single bee was seen\n\nWow! Now that’s a rhododendron!!\n\nWhat an absolute beast! Beautiful!\n\nI’d hire someone, honestly\n\nI love it\n\nGloooo oooooo oooooo oooooorious\n\nWow!\n\nBig boy!\n\nMagnificent\n\nThat's ginormous!  Similar color to our PJM but different form.  Ours are 20? Years old and maybe 7' tall. 2024 first year they didn't bloom.  I have a yellow azalea blooming now.... So confused should bloom in spring! ( Midwest US).\n\nOutstanding, WOW!!!!\n\nWow!\n\nNice\n\nWow❗ where do you live? I would love to cross something like that!!\n\nLook out for Housing density people who will say that could be 100 condos\n\nDreamy!\n\nSweet kid fort inside\n\nYa that thing needs a huge cut back.  I'm the minority here I'm sure but that is way, WAY too large.\n\nThat's insane and beautiful, but definitely in need of a fair pruning! And here I thought my ~200cm tall hydrangea was a monster. 😯\n\nHow old is this rhododendron?\n\nA magical creature definitely lives in there! 🦄\n\nok this looks like one of those AI plants i’ve been seeing everywhere 😂\n\nWow surprised it is thriving in full sun\n\n😍😍😍\n\nI would want to plant a Rhododendron and let it grow and when I die I will just help it grow\n\nDamnThat boi is thicccc and beautiful!\n\nBeautiful...\n\nAnytime you find roadkill. Bury it just outside of the drip line. This works for pretty much anything with roots. Thank me later.\n\nWow!!!!\n\nMy eyes rolled back into my head with pleasure\n\nWowwwwwww!!\n\nWow!\n\nAbsolutely gorgeous 😍\n\nIt’s an overachiever.  And it’s gorgeous.\n\nWow what a beauty of Rhododendron!\n\nOmg I’m obsessed\n\nIt has its own zip code\n\nYou must be in the south. This is huge!!\n\nwowzers\n\nI’m pretty sure they can see that from space lol\n\nMy God! What are you feeding that thing?!!!\nIt’s gorgeous.\n\nSurreal beautiful! Seems as big as the house! Thanks for sharing. Do much love and care goes into a plant so beautiful\n\nThis belongs on r/AbsoluteUnits\n\nOmgosh, so gorgeous.\n\nPretty sure it’s plotting to eat your yard.\n\nUnbelievable! It’s as big as your home!\n\nI want this pretty bad!\n\nWow! 😮\n\nThere is an alien spaceship hiding in there! :)\n\nOh is beautiful\n\nNothing can stop The Smooze!\n\nWow! Beautiful 😍\n\nWhat a gorgeous garden!! It is the biggest rhododendron I ever seen!\nI can feel how much care you took for it."

I wasn't disappointed.](https://youtu.be/QVtAIjfHAk0?si=Dc3ARNA3Iarc8QAf)\n\nMy BF makes this joke at least once a day, bravo\n\nFuckin goated reference\n\nWait that is not his hand?\n\nTake mah strawng hand\n\nPopeye only ate half the spinach can…\n\nI’m still confused lol\n\nI think he's holding a kid like you would carry a case of toilet paper one handed\n\nYeah you can see some hair. I think the kid is leaning back a little\n\nOh,.. that's a nipple? I feel weird now...\n\nHey! Watering cans can get heavy! It's called Canners arm. It's very serious,  Ya'll need to swap your watering can hands. So you don't get arms like those musical crabs. I've had tons of years as a plant hydroaloiagist for a hobby. It's a serious problem, and not recognized as a problem because it's normally just plant hydroaloiagist watering their own plants and not following OSHA regulations at home. I mean, you get home after hydrolizing plants and you just don't care which hand you use to hold the watering can. I'm surprised there really isn't more hydroaloiagist raising awareness. People are losing their careers.\n\nThe only comment I came to see!\n\nr/MightyHarvest would love this!\n\nBro got a mighty hand lmao\n\nThank you for the new sub I didn’t know I needed\n\nNo kidding it’s so funny! Reddit really has a subreddit for everything\n\nIt has often made me feel good about my diminutive crops! XD\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2feb3rmgt4kd1.jpeg?width=2268&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6d0929603f9785de361ba90883cc774889618437\n\nMy cucumber from 2 years ago may make the cut in that sub\n\nLooks like a Christmas ornament! 😂\n\nIt's not too early. Costco had the ribbons and tinsel out.\n\n🤣🤣🤣👍 Thanks, now I gotta go change my pants I laughed so hard!\n\nr/confusingperspective\n\nI still don't understand what is going on!\n\nHe's holding a shirtless baby in his left arm. \n\nWhat you're seeing as his left arm is the child's torso, and the tiny hand is the child's hand.\n\nI see it now!\n\nI’m gonna pull a Reddit classic and argue about something completely insignificant. At the top of his shoulder you can see some hair, I think it’s a person with long hair wearing a nude colored shirt\n\nEdit: never mind I saw the nipple and also kids can have hair\n\nI'm dying at\n\n&gt;and also kids can have hair\n\nThere are not a lot of children in my life lol\n\nOr it's Kuato's turn to take a picture with the watermelonette.\n\nI bet not enough people are getting the Kuato reference, but you got an upvote from me!\n\nNOW I can see the kiddo!\n\nThank you!\n\nHe was showing his melons with a lemon in his hand!\n\nHow to prevent this\n\nMulch. Loooooots of mulch. And ollas. And lots of fertilizer. In fact I grew mine on mounds of buried compost. I grew so many watermelons my friends started refusing to take them.\n\nWas that to retain water?\n\nYeah. I used free wood chips, very very deep. It also provides a nice dry firm surface for the melons to ripen. Melons need all the water, fertilizer, and sun as you can give them. Much more so than other garden produce (maybe giant pumpkins, which are also in the same family).\n\nDude, I wish I knew this. I grew 4 and they are half the size of OPs melons. I know how that sounds so take it as you want it's that bad either way.\n\nYour soil is probably low on potash. Get some heavy fertilizer and treat your garden now and then cover with mulch. Then as soon as you can manage next year putting put more fert and more mulch. Come first planting and you will have a much better ecosystem to work with.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6oqrvrpxp9kd1.jpeg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=138c9cb618526e910f277b260d459f257cb5ada7\n\ni have a couple melons already forming maybe like 8. the biggest 3 are like tennis balls. i planted them on july 7. i put a styrofoam board under them is that ok? (not pictured) also… i’m feeding rejuvenate 444 when u say they need a lot of fertilizer, is 3 tablespoons to a 10gal pot overboard?\n\nbut like can’t you just leave it on the stem for longer so it grows bigger? i don’t understand i’m sorry i dont grow fruit like you guys :(\n\nIn short, no.\n\nLike all living things, plants have natural built-in mechanisms for growing, ripening, dying, etc. They can't grow indefinitely otherwise you'd see fruits &amp; vegetables the size of skyscrapers.\n\nFruit will eventually stop growing on its own and the ripening process begins naturally. If you let it ripen too long, it doesn't taste right, the texture isn't right, etc. At some point, the fruit will over-ripen too much and die / decay.\n\nYou have to keep your plants healthy &amp; happy during the growth stages so the fruits are big enough by the time the ripening stage begins. OP looks to be still learning how to grow watermelons, haha.\n\noh yes that makes sense! thank you very much for your explanation. i guess i do know that things can’t grow super big forever but i didn’t know how we get mini of things or regular sized things, if its different seeds or if you just keep letting it grow as much as it will grow. is that how jalapeños can cork? i just learned about that a few weeks ago on reddit as well lol\n\nCurrently I have one that's bigger than the OPs growing and couple smaller ones growing I was actually surprised that I got them to grow in NH but it's been pretty damn hot up here too so it was worth a shot but being able to read others experiences and what to do to get better melons certainly helps 🙂\n\nI've used \"chip drop\" to get free wood chips... Watch their \"what to expect\" video before getting on the list.  It's not perfect but it's free wood chips.\n\nWe had a rancher donate bales of moldy straw to our community garden. Clutch for mulch. My cantaloupe are all bigger than that watermelon and I'm about to fertilize for the first time tomorrow.\n\nOh no :(\n\nI use the black weed blocker stuff under my watermelon plants and they *love* it. Warms the ground for them, I guess.\n\nYeah but wood chips are free and biodegradable, water permeable, and don't leach micro plastics. They break down into wonderful stuff for next year's garden, hugel-culture adjacent. \n\n\nI know plastic is convenient but it's really unnecessary in the home garden. 💚\n\nShredded Cardboard\n\nI've done that too but it flies away in my windy garden. For under wood chips or to kill grass or weeds though I really like flattened cardboard boxes held down with landscaping staples.\n\nHealthy soil with great compost, and mulch to retain moisture. Basically, similar to most other stuff.\n\nI like to grow my watermelon under other crops, allowing it to crawl freely while remaining semi-shaded.\n\nAlso, an understanding that some years, certain plants just won't cooperate. I've been gardening for years and usually have a wide assortment of stuff, and every year there's at least one crop that for no discernable reason is like, \"Nope, not this year.\"\n\nSometimes, no matter what you do, Mother Nature has other plans.\n\nThis may have just been the year when OP's yard decided it didn't want watermelon!\n\nNitrogen makes the plant bushy and green, phosphorus makes the roots and stalks nice and strong, and potash (potassium) makes the fruit/flowers big and bountiful.\n\nIf you don’t plant watermelons, you won’t get one like this\n\nMove to Quebec.  No water bills and it rains all bloody summer anyway.\n\nToo damn hot in Texas. I have zero pumpkins or watermelon this year…\n\nThis us what I got in Texas lol I was told by some local ground folk in in says create a shade top for them it’ll help out tremendously. I’ll have to try next year\n\n$25 you can get a cattle panel at tractor supply and make an arch. I used a couple of them and a sun shade with d rings from Amazon to protect my garden during the worst parts of the day and summer. It was easy to take the sun shade off when I didn't need it. The set up also came in handy during hail storms and other weather events. I even had a winter set up to keep warmth in and I'd drag all my pots underneath the arches.\n\nThe sun roasts everything in my Texas city , so I can see shade being important. I’ll have to make more shade too, 2 days of forgetting to water my *established* mint plant left 70% of her leaves dried out and dead!! Soon even the nopales will be roasted!\n\nBut still , cool watermelon!! Congrats on your harvest !\n\nThat's so funny, as soon as I saw the picture I was like \"oh this is probably Texas\". Oh man even my Okra there struggled and I was growing Star of David Israeli Okra. Yeah tons of mulch and shade if you hope to grow ANYTHING. Also watch out for squash vine borer moths, those things just decimated ALL of my vining plants. Hate them so much! Ironically I had some beastly Cinderella Pumpkins that were absolute troopers out in the Dallas area and withstood the oppressive drought and heat. They did their best but those damn moths got the best of them. Good luck next year man!\n\nIt's only going to get hotter. Texas politicians don't care about climate change\n\nNot sure any do, not just Texas\n\nMe fucking too lol\n\nWhat a /r/mightyHarvest you have there.\n\nMa man waters with his strong hand\n\nWhat's goin on with the other one?\n\nIt’s holding a tiny watermelon\n\nOk the other other one\n\nI had an $80 cherry tomato, but the birds got it before I could harvest😂😂\n\nOMG that’s so funny! \n\nLook at it this way, at least you have something to eat! 😬\n\nLast year a ground hog family decimated my entire crop (it wasn’t a huge crop, but a crop in my eyes.) They literally left me zilch!\n\nAnd they did it just before harvest time too! 😡 I’m sure they’re gonna be disappointed this year because due the crappy weather this year I decided to pass on a garden.\n\nSo while it’s funny what you wrote, look at it as a “win!” 😬\n\nThanks for making my day! 🤣😉👍\n\nWe’ve admired the local groundhog waddling around for years. This year he really enjoyed my attempt at a garden. Ate 6 watermelons in one day lmao. A nibble from each one! I set out a love trap to try to relocate him and he hasn’t been back in a week.\n\nDon't eat it all in one seating! You want to savor every piece of that watermelon!\n\nI don't even bother trying to produce melons July -&gt; August in Texas. Once those temps hit 100+ to stay I'll give them a shot of N to encourage vegetative growth, shade cloth the area over the main root stalk where I water directly and just try to keep them alive and relatively healthy for when the temps start falling in September. It's just too hot and too dry in many parts of the state and most plants just dump whatever water they have access to into transpiration to survive the day.\n\nYep, that's why I stopped gardening.\n\nWatch this video, you probably will still need to water in a warm climate, but it should help you get some ideas for water retention.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfBSgHgcSc4\n\nThen after you plant, mulch with smaller woodchips or straw at least 1 inch think to help retain even more water.\n\nEdit: You don't need to follow this exactly for an existing bed, but it should show you that having decomposing wood matter with 4 inches of backyard compost on top of it will retain water very very well.  In subsequent years you can add less compost 2-3 inches.\n\nBut that smile is priceless! That's why we do it, folks!\n\nSaddest watermelon, happiest gardener!\n\nIt looks like a Christmas ornament\n\nWhere-did-the-water-go-melon\n\nGet a rain barrel to spare your water bill (and make your veggies happier).  You'll recoup the cost in a year; then hope for better results next season.\n\nYou need some rain barrels so you're not paying so much to water. I've never had luck with melons either.\n\nI grew a $70 tomato once. Don't feel bad. Gotta have a sense of humor :)\n\nI would do a resin pour on that thing as a momento\n\nNext year clip vine about a foot past fruit so energy goes into melon instead of growing more vine.  Works for pumpkins too\n\n/r/thingsforants\n\nCathartic to grow things:). Great job.\n\nSmall hands, that's your problem\n\nThis is how I felt after I spent a couple of months growing three ears of corn off six plants\n\nHave you considered growing more locally native plants?\n\nYou’re so fucking lucky squirrels didn’t ruin your day.\n\n*fumes in melon loss*\n\nI have three $100 water bill watermelons!  🤣\n\nI grew 1 $200.00 ish nectarine this year!\n\nDude looks like a Latin Bichon Frise\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bjripus7q2kd1.jpeg?width=1093&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1312560c16613d0925ba5bf8e4edb0cb9e008fa1\n\nI can't make sense of the hand\n\nBro, put a bucket in your shower while you are showering.  The soap and stuff won't affect your produce, and you can make use of the greywater. Save some dough!\n\nCut in half, scoop and save pulp, turn into a watermelon martini cup\n\nI feel your pain-a deep hurt\n\nThat looks like a similar value to my three purple heirloom tomatoes, two of which I ate and one of which I didn't discover until it had boiled in place on the vine.\n\nAll jokes aside.  Get you soil analyses before you plant next year.  Your state’s Cooperative Extension Service website has instructions - search soil test.  Also search watermelons - you should get some good info, including which varieties (cultivars) that do best in your area. While on the site get the contact info for the agent assigned to your county. You can call with questions.\n\nr/roastme\n\nYou spent $100 in water to grow watermelon plants?  I have a a little over 700 sq ft of garden space, planted super-dense with various veggies, and I only spend $10-15/mo in water.\n\nYou're zone 6b. For all we know OP lives in a desert.\n\nThat's like 50,000 gallons of water\n\nhonestly, melons are difficult to get right for new people. I have tried many times, never really got an edible melon. they are either small, don't ripen, or if they're ripe they don't taste sweet\n\nnow I only grow them in deadspace where nothing else will be. also, catch rainwater - even just 5gal buckets, it does help\n\nYou can tell where all that water went! Not in the melon that's for sure!\n\nIt's cute, I like it. I'm not sure there will be enough to share however, which makes me sad. :(\n\nThat's IMPRESSive\n\n🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 I totally feel your pain! I did have two huge watermelons here that were great however, my little ones all petered out on me and I wasted my money on watering them just like you. That sucks!\n\nHahaha, at least it's cute!\n\nWatermelons (and true melons) are definitely tricky, I've been gardening for 5 years and this is the first year I got any good ones of either kind. Unfortunately it's been raining like crazy so they aren't super-sweet and not much better than a grocery store one, but at least the damn things actually grew and got ripe and taste pretty good. I don't want to think about how much it cost me vs. just buying one at the grocery store considering I didn't do much better in taste!\n\n😂 thankfully you've got your strong hand there to help you pick up that monster of a melon!\n\nit aint much, but its honest work\n\nThis picture is adorable.\n\nStart harvesting rainwater\n\nHow did you know it was ready?  I’m learning :)\n\nYea but how many $64 tomatoes did you enjoy this year?!  We actually had an amazingly mild July, surprised it didn't do better.\n\nI don't think the water bill is the problem.\n\nBeing there, done that with tomatoes, and even worse my watermelons never even provided any fruit.\n\nI have a cucumber that looks JUST like this 🥲\n\nWorth\n\nTime for tiny foodie videos!\n\nIt’s a large gooseberry!\n\nThis is 100% what happens to me.\n\nWhat is this? A watermelon for ants?\n\n[my melon](https://www.reddit.com/r/gardening/s/eYAzL5FjF2)\n\nI can fill a swimming pool in Texas and my water bill is gonna be like $50 just move\n\nI'm judging by op's shirt that *three* swimming pools would have got him a melon\n\nIt’s beautiful 🥹\n\nHmmm seems like we have part of a shoulder and an arm of a female cropped out. You can tell from the tad bit of hair that randomly pops into frame.\n\nThat’s a learning watermelon. 100$ education. Sorry buddy .\n\nIdk what magic is needed to grow decent watermelons but I can't make it work. Mine are either like this or all white inside\n\ngrow crimson sweet next time\n\nAbsolutely amazing. Congrats.\n\nRight there with you lol. Will be doing a couple of things differently next year!!\n\nI grew one like this a few years ago. It was the best tasting watermelon I've had. Absolutely sweet and delicious.\n\nEnjoy\n\nWelcome to gardening 😂\n\nStory of my life this summer\n\nCould qualify for r/mightyharvest  Hall of Fame\n\nGardening - hundreds of dollars spent for $15 worth of produce, gotta love it! I’ve got one that big that’s been on the vine for at least a week. I’m trying to rotate it and hoping it gets a little bigger.\n\nNailed it\n\nr/confusingperspective\n\nCame here to say that... tiny hand....\n\nNice job! Lol\n\nYea… you need atleast a $500 water bill for growing watermelons.\n\nI totally thought this was one of those cucumbers that look like a melon!\n\nGrowing sugar babies, I hope \n\nShe's beautiful 😍 🍉\n\nGod, don't I know it!\n\nOh, man, my cantaloupe are bigger than your watermelon, lol\n\nYou go Glen Coco!!\n\nEat it ....with a tweezer\n\nLet’s go!\n\nThe strong strange hand!\n\nGreat melon! Let it rioeny, dump alcohol in it, enjoy!\n\nr/confusing_perspective\n\nGotta start somewhere!\n\nWe can all see where the water went? 😝\n\nPro tip: you can use water from your ac condensation line to water your garden.  Mine produces ~5 gallons a day.\n\nHow did you know when to harvest? I have cantaloupe and watermelons this size and they kinda stopped growing idk how to tell when it's ready when they aren't huge?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j4aif0pk06kd1.jpeg?width=260&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b7f314cde90a8a4dd05abfbed5d8d9d90eea6899\n\ndefinitely save rain water\n\nhow about the taste?\n\nLol. I feel your pain... Got 2 tomatoes off my tomato plants and watered them every evening\n\nWhy'd you pick it so soon\n\nI feel this in my soul…\n\nI feel your pain. Next year I think I’ll take my garden budget and spend it at my local farmers markets.\n\nI got one of those. It’s so sad for me. Second year in a row.\n\n100 water bill in one bite lmao\n\nr/mightyharvest would appreciate this!\n\nThis is what our watermelons looked like lol\n\nAwe, you tried!! And it IS a melon!!! ❤️🍉\n\nMy watermelons turned out to be the same size this season!\n\nShitty weather... I found that vegetables are way more difficult to crop than rearing animals. Ain't that crazy or what?\n\nLOL! I hope it tastes good. 😉\n\nBaby watermelon, baby hand. Yup everything checks out...\n\nHa! That's rookie numbers.\n\n\"Open yoooooour miiiiind\"\n\nMine was about size, I accidentally dropped it and it busted 😭\n\n100 dollar water bill how"

    "all_comment_text": "What?!  I have to show my father.  He’s always been a gardener and also can’t waste anything or throw it away.  One year he had so many carrots he started juicing them.  He drank so much carrot juice he turned orange.  He’s also the guy who makes boxes of fruit and vegetables, leaves it on the neighbours doorsteps, rings the bell and runs away.\n\nLOL I’m picturing your dad sneaking up with box in hand, dumping and running off like a 10yo! Then watching from behind the bushes sees the bewildered but pleasantly surprised neighbour gawking at the gift of fresh veges some kind stranger left on their doorstep.\n\nThat’s exactly how it was.  :) \n\nWhen we left home and he still had the huge garden he’d hire students from a local school, teach them how to garden and opened a farm stand down the road.  He taught them some good life skills and they earned some money (he’d match it towards tuition) and he donated the money the stand made to a scholarship fund.  \n\nI used to hate gardening in the summers, we each had our little plots where we could grow what we wanted but had to take care of it.  Now I’d give almost anything to have the space for a garden of my own.\n\nI can relate about being doing ‘forced labour’ during our summer holidays! Our parents were market gardeners. But I love gardening now and can spend hours in the sun! Your dad sounds like an amazingly generous guy.\n\nThis is SO AWESOME!! \n\nI grew up in a food desert but we had a neighborhood garden that was run by a neighbor. He’d get bikes donated. Once we grew something or helped for a certain amount of hours we could earn a bike and vegetables from the garden. \n\nOur family didn’t have much money so that bike felt like I had won the lottery. To earn my bike, I grew a very unimpressive watermelon.\n\nYour dad is awesome!\n\nThank you for saying that.  I will screenshot this for him.  He’s a really lovely person.  I’m lucky to have him.\n\nthat is beyond a doubt...just effing cool!\n\nIM JUST BITTER THAT SOME PARENTS SHARED THEIR GARDEN. Mine did not. Mom did not allow anyone else to have opinions or input. I could pull weeds while supervised if she felt like it, but that was it. Bah humbug\n\n😂! Maybe if I start now, I can be an Oompa Loompa by Halloween!\n\nHaha, he stayed orange for quite a long time.\n\nYou got me \"He drank so much carrot juice he turned orange\". That's so funny but I can picture it clearly in my head.\n\nYour dad can ding-dong veggie ditch us anytime!!!\n\nI love carrot juice!\n\nnot the turning orange!\n\nI laughed audibly for quite some time reading “He drank so much carrot juice he turned orange” 😂😂😂😂\n\nLovely! Your soil must be like cake.\n\nMost of them were grown in my raised beds, which have pretty loose soil but I planted a few in ground in very clay-heavy soil and they performed okay! They weren’t as big as the raised bed carrots but were still a decent size\n\nThat's awesome! What will you make? Or how will you store all these?\n\nI’ll chop and freeze most of them and then wash and bag the rest for fresh eating! I was also hoping to donate some to my local wildlife rehab centre but they don’t have many animals at the moment so they don’t need any carrots!\n\nYou can always donate to a food pantry for people, too.\n\nI tried donating garden produce a few years ago to my local food bank and they wouldn’t take them since I wasn’t an actual farmer but I should call around a few more places to see if they’ll take some! Thanks for the suggestion😊\n\n(You are a real farmer just look at these carrots) Oh yeah some places are very \"look a gift horse in the mouth.\" You dont wana donate to those people who are picky anyways. I was a garden donation cordianator, and i took many many zucchinis (the only thing people would donate) to the food pantry. Just call around, some should be happy with any produce donations. They had gotten more open around here to taking garden produce, especially since covid but there are still those very strange ones. That or just more for you i guess, haha.\n\nSome community gardens are able to wrangle farm status to get tax breaks for the landowner *and* contribute large quantities of fresh produce to food banks.\n\n&gt; You are a real farmer just look at these carrots\n\n+1\n\n\nalso, I like your username, 🌈 🍄\n\nChurch &amp; small community org food pantries tend to be more flexible on accepting garden produce and one-off donations. The large food banks do awesome work but have stricter regulations to abide by.\n\nAnd as an actual farmer, those are impressive carrots!\n\nI called a few places today!\n\nMaybe try a community fridge instead\n\nNah!\n\n[removed]\n\nThanks! It’s been 3 months and we’re still eating fresh carrots from the garden!\n\nJust a note for the clay soil, it can be made workable and softer overtime there are some no till practices that will make the soil more friendly over time. Look into “the no till growers” they have a lot of good tips\n\nThanks for the tip! I’m slowly working on the soil. A lot of my other crops struggled because of it this year!\n\nAs far as nutrient/mineral content it’s the best but making it accessible to the plants is the “hard” part. Totally worth the effort though good luck 🫡\n\nIt doesn't look like OP needs gardening tips lol\n\nHow deep are your raised beds, if I may ask? I tried carrots in a nearly 2ft deep raised bed this year and they were teeeeeny tiny lil thangs!\n\nMy beds are 16” deep\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p0l8qsqyr6wd1.jpeg?width=629&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eb80873c5382089e8dac1e407b36ac8d5c7887ce\n\nI’ve only ever been able to grow carrot tops successfully.\n\nI hear they’re edible? Lol\n\nSame…despite containers with loose soil, amending with perlite, peat moss…hoping, praying, begging ….\n\nI feel this! My first year and only 1 of the ENTIRE PACKET I planted over the season took. The carrot was the size of a toothpick.\n\nCarrot top pesto is delicious \n\nHoly smokes, I thought the white one was a Daikon radish based on the size! Nice harvest\n\nThanks! The white ones are lunar white carrots!\n\nWow! Those are huge.\n\nBiggest carrots I’ve ever grown!\n\nAre you a garden gnome?  The carrot size would make sense if so.\n\n😂\n\nWow. What Zone you in?. Those a humongous.  You need to find a carrot growing contest.\n\nI’m in zone 3, Canada!\n\nDam. I'm 6b and mine not anything close to that good.\n\n🤯❤️ Zone 4 here. What variety? Any growing tips and tricks? \n\nAlso, how do they taste?\n\nThe white carrots are lunar white and the orange are called bolero. I didn’t do anything crazy with them, I fertilized with an organic fertilizer and they got a lot of water because of all the rain I had.\n\nThe lunar white carrots taste like a less-sweet carrot and the bolero taste like a very sweet carrot!\n\nThank you so much for the information! Will definitely try those varieties this coming year\n\n“Bolero carrots”…you grew “[Botero](https://themaritimeexplorer.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Botero-Family.jpg)” carrots!\n\n#HoldCropsNotFish 🎉\n\n😂\n\npulling mine after first frost\n\nMy first frost was 2 weeks ago so I’m feeling a little behind pulling these now but they still look good!\n\nHoly moly, human included for scale!!😝\n\nCongratulations🥳\n\n😂 thanks!\n\nWhere is this? Midwest?\n\nManitoba, Canada\n\nOh how awesome!\n\nLiterally magnificent!!\n\nThose should be the new stock photos for the seeds they came from.\n\n😂\n\nNever in my life have I seen carrots even half that large and now I have another life goal!\n\nHoly molly\n\nImpressive!!!!\n\nWowwwww\n\nPlease share those genetics. 😭🙏🏿😔😂\n\ngreen carrots?!\n\nGirl what are you feeding them??\n\nJust Orgunique tomato and vegetable fertilizer! We also got a lot of rain this year, maybe that helped too 😅\n\nNice crop!\n\nDid you mean organic or is there a brand called Orgunique? I need to try whatever you used to make those monsters!\n\nIt’s a Canadian brand 😊 it’s in most of my local garden centres but I’m unsure how easy it would to find outside Canada [orgunique tomato fertilizer](https://www.westcoastseeds.com/products/tomato-and-vegetable-formula-4-3-7-3?_ab=0&amp;_fd=0&amp;_sc=1&amp;currency=CAD&amp;srsltid=AfmBOoqdI2ImjtXZcq-RltJuaaOHXCBulXhYKXiVirY4Y-YLJsmTxqEXIRQ&amp;utm_campaign=sag_organic&amp;utm_content=sag_organic&amp;utm_medium=product_sync&amp;utm_source=google&amp;variant=7478807363644)\n\nThanks!\n\n How do you store them to make them last as long as possible over the winter\n\nI’m going to chop and freeze most of them for soups and stews and then bag the rest and put them in my fridge for fresh eating!\n\nDayam, some nice looking tubers!\n\nThanks!\n\nbeauties!!!!!\n\nThanks!\n\nThat is seriously impressive! I have been getting good carrots this year for the first time but not that size!! First time with raised beds this year so the nice thing is they are straight not all gnarled up\n\nI’ve never had carrots this big before either! We had a lot of rain this year and I’m wondering if that helped?\n\nHoly cow, that would make a ton of carrot cake!! I'm in love!!\n\nThe plan is to make a few carrot cakes for the freezer!\n\nI would be firing up the pressure canner!   ¯\\\\\\_( ͡❛ ͜ʖ ͡❛)\\_/¯\n\nYou could easily make enough carrot cake for a homeless shelter with this! It's really awesome!\n\nSo awesome 💯\n\n👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻\n\nAI /s\n\nDang! I just complimented another dude on him having the best carrots from a home gardener I had ever seen. Until now. You now have the best carrots! They look like they've been fed carrot steroids!\n\n[removed]\n\nThank you😊\n\nWhy are they so big?\n\nI think it must be the varieties and maybe all the rain I got? My carrots have never been this big\n\nMy sweet potatoes were big but no eggplants 😔\n\nAw! You look beautiful holding those bad bois. Good job.\n\nThank you!\n\nI'd ferment those puppies, freeze a few, can a few, and pickle a few. Yummy. Reminds me when I was in graduate school and my husband and I were both teacher assistance barely making enough to pay our rent and he went to a gas station to get gas and when he returned he had a tow sack about 50 pounds or more full of beautiful carrots. I called my older sister and she said, I'll come and help you can them and we were up until midnight caning carrots. She brought me several pint jars of peas she had canned from her garden and between the Mac ad cheese and the ramen noodles, we lived on peas and carrots. LOL.\n\nOnly thing better than those carrots is how pretty you are!😍\n\nThank you 😊\n\nThat's insane.\n\nWild hey 😅\n\nHoly moly. Great job.\n\nThanks!\n\nHoly 🥕\n\nWhat's the variety? They are so huge I'm thinking they are a fodder carrot of some sort.\n\nThe white carrots are called lunar white and the orange ones are called bolero\n\nYou know what they say, size matters!\n\nLooks great!\n\nThanks!\n\nOh my god these are amazing! What’s your secret?\n\nOrganic fertilizer, lots of rain, and a little neglect lol\n\nNothing better than fresh ones, like a totally different experience\n\nOutstanding! I only grow flowers and leave vegetables to some pros like you.\n\nNice! We got a great harvest out of our raised beds this year as well. I was so shocked at the size of them and just how healthy they looked. If you’re into it definitely make some carrot cake cupcakes, that was the first thing I made\n\nWow! 😍 Some potatoes and onions and you're stocked for soups, stews, sheet pan dinners and slow cooker meals. 😋\n\nWhat soil did you use?!\n\nIt’s a 4-way mix with mushroom compost from a local soil company\n\nBut they also grew pretty well in my clay soil\n\nThose are incredible, nicely done!\n\nWow! Just wow. Those are huge!\n\nI did not know carrots could get that big. Wow\n\nOP is a leprechaun.\n\nThose are huge. Are you in Alaska?\n\nCanada\n\nWow!!!!\n\nOmg, please tell me what type of fertilizer/soil amendments you use! Those are fantastic!\n\nThe soil is a 4-way mix with mushroom compost and I fertilized with [this](https://www.westcoastseeds.com/products/tomato-and-vegetable-formula-4-3-7-3?_ab=0&amp;_fd=0&amp;_sc=1&amp;currency=CAD&amp;srsltid=AfmBOoqdI2ImjtXZcq-RltJuaaOHXCBulXhYKXiVirY4Y-YLJsmTxqEXIRQ&amp;utm_campaign=sag_organic&amp;utm_content=sag_organic&amp;utm_medium=product_sync&amp;utm_source=google&amp;variant=7478807363644)\n\nNice haul\n\nOh my gosh\n\nThose are huge\n\nNice haul !\n\nOmg! Those are crazy huge! That's the carrot I always wish to grow under those magnificent greens.\n\nMassive!\n\nAmazing carrots!\n\nSweet harvest! 🥕\n\nyou are a gorgeous lady!!\n\nI've never seen green carrots, Im amazed!\n\nThe smaller ones are all white but the large ones got so big that they literally pushed themselves out of the dirt and I think the exposure to sunlight caused the tops to turn green!\n\noo be careful, I heard that may cause solanine poisoning then. I know that's how it works with potatoes, idk if its the same with carrots though\n\nThey look tasty!!!\n\nWow. You can probably make a carrot cake with only 1 of these 😄\n\nStop, you’re coordinating with your harvest😂 even if you didn’t mean to, the colors of this photo turned out super cute. \n\nPlease share your secrets. Mine are always minuscule\n\nTeach us your ways op\n\nI have no idea what happened to be honest! We did have a lot of rain this year so maybe that helped?!\n\nWildly impressive harvest!\n\nHow?! 😱 Mine sprout then disappear... Those are insane!\n\nAt first I thought she was dressed as a carrot\n\nI swear I didn’t plan my outfit 😂\n\nwow\n\nFloridian, here. Admiring your massive carrots and longing for soil free of root knot nematodes.\n\nWow so impressive! I thought the ones on the right were sausages at first!\n\nThis might just BE one of my favorite pictures everrrr\n\nWhoa, just have to say those carrots are STUNNING! Great job!! 👏🏻\n\nAwesome!\n\nPhenomenal carrots!! 😍and you have such a radiant smile!!✨\n\nThank you!☺️\n\nI was always told growing up that eating carrots would help me see in the dark, but I recently found out that this isn't true! Although if it was you'd certainly be seeing shapes and colours with the size of those! The myth was actually born out of war time necessity due to war time rationing and the British wanting to hide new radar technology during WW2. I recently made a video about it if you're curious about learning more.\n\n[link](https://youtu.be/vago7-qIyi4?si=2DpOJpmLwmMtVIgm)\n\nI would Gift you a Green Ring. Nicely done. ♥️"

I would be proud haha\n\nI always wonder too!!! There must be a post somewhere on some social media site like the one about the sun from Teletubbies, or the baby on Nevermind haha\n\nWell his info is here, but he’s like 8-9 now.  https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/boy-goes-viral-angry-class-photos-mom-says-others-trying-cash-fame-dont-trying-use-son-likes-money-221629412.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAMFZ0Gu7FSbcnmbRAQmgsRh1cRbje5GGMaIhTjItF0HggJosPbIwsVf8nUy3AlRvRT_u3Olzo34rhbQA3j7ScK7t59s_1o-wfOLwdm7plpnhk8jPkE6r-LjR3UqfzgT5kEUheyxMv88aedzylodj1VBBRZVLk6ymR7QlbKOkCaoe\n\nHey those teletubbies  helped me through some dark times, or it could have been the massive amount of meds I was put on when I was in the mental hospital. The day room had PBS and the teletubbies where on in the mornings.\n\n4 years of my bulbs coming up and not flowering I truly totally am not seething at every saffron post I see.\n\nHave you tried dividing the bulbs? They might be overcrowded.\n\nAnother thought.... What about trying to get the saffron to bolt? I'm in zone 10 and have issues with bolting because of heat. But saffron may want a hotter climate than zone 3. I'd try placing an upside-down fishtank on corner blocks (for some airflow) and see if I could get the saffron to \"bolt\". I always thought saffron was an orchid and learned today it was more crocus....either are still semi tropical\n\nPh issue?!? 🤔\n\nLook at Mr Money Bags over here 🌸\n\nI read this is a Brooklyn accent.\n\nOh lala Wawaweewa\n\nKing of the castle king of the castle\n\nMr. balloon hands ova here\n\nI think you’re rich now.\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/oyrkfz0gxiyd1.gif\n\nWhere do you live and where did you get the bulbs- mine never come up :(\n\nEastern MA. I put down some bone meal when I planted these and it seems to have worked very well.\n\nWhere did you buy the bulbs from ?\n\nI got mine from Strictly Medicinal Seeds. May have been pre-order only.\n\nAs someone else already asked - do you have a recommendation for where to get the corms?\n\nStrictly Medicinal Seeds’ bulbs are doing well for me.\n\nUsername checks out\n\nI’m not afraid to share what works for me. Too much garbage these days. Really wish I could change the name Reddit gave me. Either way, the folks at that company are the real deal and have high quality products.\n\nI am in NH!! This gives me so much hope, I had seen your post and I thought “damn I wish I lived down South”\n\nohhhh I'm in central MA. maybe I'll try some next year\n\nYay near same region. I will try to plant them\n\nOmg so Minecraft told the truth\n\n*corms not bulbs\n\nGot mine from Tulip World\n\nI don’t mean to alarm you but it looks like you sprouted a princess… they can be highly invasive\n\nAre you talking about a princess tree?\n\nNo, the princess toy in the back, top right\n\nI found the toy while digging up in the yard one day and figured that's a good spot for her.\n\nshe’s in a crocus forest!\n\nOh hahah my eye did not even catch that\n\nDidn’t know saffron came from flowers or what they came from at all. very pretty\n\nThey are fall flowering Crocuses (Crocus sativus). The reason saffron is expensive is because it can only be harvested in the fall by hand, when they pick out the stigmas. It’s unfortunately too cold to grow them where I live or I’d have a bunch, I already grow tons of crocuses.\n\nContainers! Assuming you have the space, you can still grow a ton! They only need 5 hours of light, one good watering (usually, depends on how deep the soil is, how much light, if you use a heat mat, etc.), and can be planted super close together! (Recommended spacing is 2-3 inches, but I've found that so long as they're not touching they'll grow well!)\n\nI know you probably already knew all that, but I love growing them and have to do so in containers because our weather is too volatile in the fall to risk it with something as pricey as saffron.\n\nI don’t have enough space indoors but I’ll keep that in mind if I want to experiment. I’ve forced bulbs before so I’m guessing it’s about the same thing.\n\nThey can even stand a little frost and snow.\n\nI was like nahhhh that’s a crocus, not a “saffron flower”! Today I learned saffron is from a crocus. Haha\n\nSAME! I was looking for this explanation 😂\n\nDitto!\n\nOh wow amazing. Yeah I had no idea about this either!\n\nYup, the stigma. Each has three and they are harvested by hand. That’s why it’s so expensive.\n\nNot only that but it takes thousands of crocus stamens to make a pound. And a couple hundred to make an ounce. But the good thing is saffron is super strong, and a little goes a long way.\n\nYup. Chef in school kept hers locked up. Let me use it in a pilaf once and it changed my life. For the worse, sadly, as my financial status makes saffron forever a memory. A pleasant one, though\n\nwhat is a dish you would recommend that spotlights the saffron flavor? i have some but im not sure what to cook it with, thought ive heard rice is good with it\n\nMy favorite thing to do with it is make saffron milk, warmed in the stove like you do hot cocoa.  I also add honey and tulsi to mine, absolutely wonderful in the winter, especially if you experience seasonal depression!\n\nsaffron has been studied as an alternative to antidepressants with v positive results! (sorry didn’t cite it here but look up saffron ssri comparitive research)\n\nOh yeah, that’s why I started growing her :)\n\nawesome. i wanna try!\n\nHot milk, white chocolate and saffron 😍\n\nI only have that one experience with it, sad to say. But I hear Paella demands it. Also a rice dish. It’s got a sweet, floral taste. Hard to describe. Like delicate and pungent at the same time, a little goes a very long way. But this is all from memory from 15 years ago. \n\nI will say that I’ve seen Lowe’s Food carry saffron before. Small chapstick sized tubes for $25 or so\n\nhaha yeah i have one of those itty bitty tubes, its got about 20 stamens lol but i love a good paella so ill try that, thank you!\n\nYou only need like 1-2 stems per dish which is nice at least\n\nExactly. And if it’s for special occasions then a personal garden is absolutely perfect. Especially since purple is my theme\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ya1wrniijpyd1.jpeg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=375c1762189656f5037f9760542986b0ab50b387\n\nShakshuka, dark tea, custard or creme brulee, chocolate milk. It goes wonderful with both sweet and savoury, and even sweet acidic like tomatoes. I like to make a chicken dish with saffron and pimento de la vera. In my bakery we used to use real vanilla, but when those prices exploded saffron was, per portion, cheaper, so we used either saffron or Tonka beans as alternatives for a while\n\nSaffron and rosewater ice cream!   Saffron rosewater (or cardamom) pistachio cookies!   Orange saffron pistachio cake!   Saffron rice, saffron mashed potatoes, saffron couscous, saffron lemon chicken, saffron chickpea stew with tomatoes, saffron chickpea stew with spinach..\n\nAaaaand now I'm hungry.\n\nThe Badía line of spices offers an affordable saffron that’s enjoyable!\n\nOmg I did not know they carried it! Badia is amazing. Same qual it y as McCormick for less than half the price. Thanks!!\n\nHahaha me too. Tried it, loved it, never again.\n\n[deleted]\n\nThat sounds amazing. I just planted a pecan tree that sprouted in my yard, I could sub that for cashews and have 2 of the 4 ingredients homegrown\n\nI deleted my comment, since it was redundant, sorry--I love that idea! I've been slowly gathering and growing perennials to see how much stuff can fully make with them, like a salsa garden. Recently, I've been working on a fully-homegrown Fire Cider collection: I've got apple and lemon trees, horseradish, ginger, garlic, walking onion, then  parsley and hot peppers I regrow every year. If all goes well, I should have enough established to make it in about four years.\n\nCostco has a decent price.\n\nI had some. But sadly it is no longer in my budget.\n\nEnjoy fondly the memories it gave you, and hope to one day reunite\n\nI must be rich! My priest says I have the stigmata bad, so I guess I’m just lucky 🍀\n\nNo that’s different but still relatable. My eyes suck, too\n\nand then how are they processed? dried?\n\nI actually do not know that. I never thought to ask. I am disappointed in myself for that one.\n\nMy little Persian heart is all aflutter!\n\nI planted my bulbs and ignored them and they sprouted beautifully. Probably the easiest thing I ever grew lol\n\nWhere did you get the bulbs?\n\nBrent and Becky’s. All of the bulbs were nicely packaged and every single one bloomed. Always get good stuff from them.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eeui6bndxjyd1.jpeg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=70eb27c3695b328c908656d1b0a8c00288ee82f8\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8w2gc8ugxjyd1.jpeg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=163143fcae80145f595b22a79eb801bf2b03f6cb\n\nDarn just checked their website and out of stock. I'll have to try again next year.\n\nYou could also try Spring Hill nursery. They have good stuff too. Crocus for saffron might be hard to find this late in the year though.\n\nOut of stock but they do have a notification button for back in stock\n\n[pinetree](https://www.superseeds.com/products/saffron-crocus)\n\nThat's like what? $96,381.62...right?\n\nPluck those pistils and use them as God instructs.\n\n1. Pistils are not pistols and unique wordplay be reserved for the LORD until afrer Judgment day that God may relish His glory JBB\n\nJust Be Better?\n\nWhen you play Me, as in the Holy Spirit of God, numbers will heel in the game of chess. Man shall not number the intelligence of any being, nor shall any angel number the ability of babes\n\nOnly demons may number for that has been and always will be their superfluous downfall.\n\nAs I showed my Flock in my chess videoes, there Is a way to sacrifice without trading.\n\nAffecting an evangelical diction brings forth downvotes, even in the realm of sarcasm that is Reddit. Too many people aren’t distanced enough yet\n\n&lt;3\n\nTaje three pistils and put them into the middle of a glass of water with rhe intention of delusting your heart from thy previous master\n\nI understand this is one of the most valuable spices, but where I’m from we never had it in any of our dishes. \nWhat can you make with Saffron food wise? What makes it so valuable and how could you sell it?\n\nRice/Risotto dishes are popular to put saffron in but I have a recipe for pistachio blondies w/ saffron cream cheese icing that I really enjoy.\n\nIt's value comes from the labor it takes to pick the delicate red stigma.\n\nSaffron rice is fucking delicious\n\nYeah the Persian [tahdig rice](https://feelgoodfoodie.net/recipe/crispy-persian-rice/) is not getting enough shout outs in this thread.\n\nI think I need the recipe for those blondies please. Thank you.\n\nCan we all have the recipe?\n\nI need this recipe\n\nPlease and thanks\n\nIn Indian recipes, we make sweets and color rice dishes with saffron. I mix it with milk and add to my rice (pulao)/ biriyani. It adds the most beautiful golden glow and smell to the rice.\n\nYou us milk in biriyani?! I am new to Nepal and Indian food and very uncultured in home cooked meals, but trying to learn. I thought biriyani was made from a reduced stock to really give that taste.\n\nVery very little. Just the tiniest bit. I'm not sure if it's correct though as per recipes. It's just how it's done in my home. Some people mix rose water but since my parents hated that smell it was replaced with milk.\n\nSaffron risotto is a popular saffron dish\n\nYou can make Paella and other dishes with rice\n\nI add it with my Chai, rice, sweets, and so on.\n\nAs an Italian/European, the only dish I can think of is \"Risotto alla Milanese\" - saffron risotto. Apart from that, it is not used at all in italian cuisine or european generally...perhaps Spain is the only exception to this, given its historical arab influence. If you go to places like Iran  you'll see a LOT of saffron usage.\n\nFor everyone who wants to try saffron but doesn't feel like growing it, buy from your local Indian grocer. It's probably behind the counter so you'll have to ask for it. They sell it for like half the price chain grocery stores do!\n\nOr Persian grocer\n\nSeeing crocuses remind me of the Runaway Bunny. “I’ll become a crocus in a hidden garden.”\n\nThis was my comfort book when I was little 🥲\n\nI love reading it to my son and the illustrations are beautiful.\n\nThis the season for them to grow!\n\nI just saw some of these by the road in Portland and they seemed to be randomly growing and I don't think the home owner nearby even knew or took the saffron. They quickly seemed to wilt (?) after they came up suddenly.\n\nWhere does one get saffron plants? They look really pretty\n\n[I ordered online here but looks like they're out of stock right now](https://www.superseeds.com/products/saffron-crocus)\n\nThanks for the info!\n\nThose are GORGEOUS! \n\n\nI had no idea this is where saffron comes from. I would love to grow those flowers just for the aesthetic! \n\n\nI'm going to do a little research, but I'm in zone 9 and based on another comment I'm not sure it's possible here.\n\nDid you buy these bulbs at a local nursery or where can I order them online?\n\n[online here](https://www.superseeds.com/products/saffron-crocus)\n\nLook at those juicy threads wow\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rsody4i09myd1.jpeg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=58608ee7ec53adb6ab649dba4d715ede7d731ec9\n\nThose are gorgeous…do there grow here in NC cuz I’d love some\n\nThey grow in zones 6-8 so I think you should be able to grow them.\n\nNow that is exciting. You’ve made my day 😁\n\nWhere'd you buy the bulbs from\n\n[I ordered from here, they're out of stock right now](https://www.superseeds.com/products/saffron-crocus)\n\nWhere did you get seeds?\n\nDon't think I have ever gotten anything to grow that fast. Teach me please!! Teach me your secrets!!\n\nI think it was the bone meal I put down.\n\nAll these saffron posts are making me want to grow them too.\n\nPurdy\n\nNice. I have some growing as well but its not blooming at this time.\n\nLocation?\n\nEastern MA\n\nI’m just wild about those\n\nBut are they wild about you?\n\nI’m not sure but they called me mellow yellow which is usually a good sign.\n\nVery pretty, they remind me of Crocus\n\nThey're saffron crocuses\n\nIs this type different than the ones that bloom in early spring? I always got excited seeing them pop up as a fist sign of spring and didnt realize that there is a fall bloom.\n\nI thought i had saffron crocus, but apparently i have a spring blooming cousin, unfortunate, i still need to find some real saffron crocus'\n\nThey bloom in the fall. They are doing what they are supposed to do.\n\n[deleted]\n\nThey are fall blooming crocus, so they're right on time.\n\n[deleted]\n\nOh, I honestly thought you meant your saffron crocus were blooming.\n\nI never had saffron before, what does it taste like?\n\nYay!! Congrats! I love home grown saffron! I try every year\n\nI'm a long way from plant biology class... Are the ones without the three red saffron strands a different sex, or will they grow still?\n\nSo cool, where did u find the seeds?\n\nHope you planted more.\n\nMy saffron crocus’ didn’t flower. 😭😭😭😭\n\nWow\n\nSo pretty!!\n\nCongratulations! Where did you buy your bulbs?\n\nIt will go everywhere!\n\nWelp, just had to impulsively buy some saffron crocus bulbs\n\nWow\n\nnice 😍\n\nOh OK that explains it. We planted 50 of them for spring.\n\nI planted mine in early October. Just sprouted 1 white shoot for now. I hope they like yours soon 🙆🏻‍♀️\n\nThey're good to go...$100000\n\nIsn’t that cool? Mine sprung up just one week after planting, and I forget about them every year so it’s always a nice surprise when they pop up in the fall.\n\nI think I want to plants some too.  Good idea.\n\nLooks like saffron’s mad about you!\n\nSo jealous my saffron is not growing this year\n\nWow!!\n\nThat’s worth $100,000\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sbxt16p3lryd1.jpeg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bb3d268f76b893e9890332c8e492a3d0284445c4\n\nI live in southern Maine and planted bulbs four weeks ago- this dinner plate has my second harvest and  there is more coming. I ordered 100 bulbs from Hans Rotteveel President Roco Saffron +31 (0) 6 15650514 [https://rocosaffron.com/](https://rocosaffron.com/)\n\nI used planting instructions from The University of Vermont- they have a saffron institute. 100$ invested and I’m guessing I’ll get 50$ of saffron this year- very excited for the next paella!\n\nIs it hard to plant saffron??what actualy we need too do?\n\nI didn’t know they bloomed that quickly!\n\nBought a house last year, this year found out we have some saffron crocus guests popping up randomly in the yard! I believe a little rodent planted them there a bit ago. I’m excited to dig them up to separate them\n\nI just bought some on Etsy\n\nAw so beautiful\n\nCONSPIRACY!!!\n\nIn Georgia I think we've hit 2nd summer.\n\nWell aren’t you gods favorite 🙄 😂\n\nThose kind of look like them nighthowlers from zootopia\n\nSaffron. Is not. The name. Of the plant. You can't plant saffron.\n\nSaffron is the spice you collect from the plant.\n\nThe plant is called a crocus.\n\nWhere did you buy the seeds?"

    "all_comment_text": "Looking sharp!\n\nLove the way their outline echoes the contrast of the bricks!\n\nI had them next to my super old asphalt driveway in Florida.  They broke the asphalt to pieces and ended up growing right through the concrete floor inside the garage.  But they look nice.\n\nI have underestimated their power\n\nLmao, give it time!\n\nWell they are called mother in law tongue! 🤪\n\nThis isn't even their final form.\n\nMetal containers to keep them in?\n\nThey will definitely do that. I have one that has busted through 3 different ceramic pots trying to escape. Now she’s in a big plastic-type pot.\n\nI’ve put mine in two 1cm thick resin wastebaskets with holes I drilled into the bottom. I can’t wait to see it bust thru some day, but I expect it will be several more years from now.\n\nYou never know! It could be quicker than you think. Mine grew really fast once I got it happy!\n\nGive it time\n\nWOW! Hahahaha\n\nThen I dug them up, tossed them in the trash, left them there for a week in the broiling Florida sun.  Then I felt bad, so I dumped the trash out, washed them off, rolled them up in plastic and flew to Virginia w them in my suit case and potted them.  That was in 2020.  I just repotted them last week and made 4 planters out of them and my bestie took one to her house.  Indestructible boogers.\n\nOMG, they are! I had one in my office back in March 2020. Then we went on lockdown for a couple of years. A friend got into the building and watered it a few times. Damn thing is still alive!\n\nThis sounds like the start to a horror movie!\n\nI keep killing mine.  What’s the secret?\n\nMaybe ignore it.  Water every two weeks.\n\nStop watering it. Seriously. Like, I water maybe once a month in a very dry climate\n\nI have a set of 4 that were inside an office lobby that had exactly zero windows, was in soothing half light and neons and watered whenever someone remembered. I was there five years and honestly thought they were fake. I got to take them home when the office got renovated and they’ve been existing happily in my window ever since. Even grew some new leaves!\n\nPart of the season I don't like snake plants is when living in Florida and just how much area they can take over and people suck at maintaining their land scapes\n\nIt’s so hard to keep up in Florida.  You plant a philodendron and the next thing you know it’s little shop of horrors.  My kid’s basil was 3 feet high and 3 feet wide.  He planted it right where the water comes from the AC dehumidifier, and it loves it there.\n\nSend me your giant basil, I will eat it all\n\nIt’s right by the front door so you get a giant whiff every time you come and go.\n\nThat’s soooool clean! I love the color contrast between the plants and your beautiful house!\n\nWhere are you located?\n\n[deleted]\n\nI was going to say that that brickwork is the most Sydney looking thing I've seen on this sub, haha. \n\nThe M-I-L look fantastic! Any secret?\n\nGive them all the sun, water them thoroughly like once a week or every 7-12 days depending on temps and such, and plant them initially in soil with good drainage!\n\nSO awesome when the flower too, such great plants!\n\nIt’s lovely.  I tried something similar (central Texas) and a freeze turned them to mush.\n\nLooks like Western Sydney\n\nDaft punk\n\nHow long have you had these planted? They look well established.\n\nSame question I had. I thought mother of tongue was only indirect light\n\nYou can do  direct, but you need to acclimate them. We have them growing in southern california outside.\n\nDang, I tried to get mine to grow outside. I’m in northern california. I slowly acclimated them to outdoors in early spring and they still got sunburned in the summer. Then in the winter we had a few freezes and what was still left of the plant froze and turned black and rotted. 😭\n\nThey gotta be strong adult ones, not weak frail ones just planted! Think established strong plants. I personally don't bother growing them outside, I got one in potted on my patio instead. It's only direct certain parts of the day not full all day.\n\nHaha mine must have been pathetic weaklings lol. I will try to raise stronger snake plants 😁\n\nThey’re tropical native to west Africa and grow in full sun in situ. They’re low light tolerant. Most plants that are marketed as low light are really low light tolerant but will grow best with much more light.\n\nWhen i put mine outside for the summer they bloom\n\nHere in AK I guess they’d do okay for part of the summer but with all the gardening of proper outside plants. They do well in south facing windows and have had an occasional bloom. They have a different scent but I don’t know if they’re like this for you but they do become sticky and thorn like when the flowers die.  They’re one tough plant though….I had one planted in a cheap, flexible plastic pot and when it started putting up an offshoot it literally spilt the side of the pot!!!!  I put them in sturdy hard plastic pots when I divide them.\n\nOne tough plant is right. I’ve had this one for 40 years. It came in a gift planter from my grandmother when i got my gall bladder out in college.  It’s been through everything.\n\nIt will survive the winter in the darkest corner of my house, but this year i stuffed it in a corner behind the couch end table where it gets light from a lamp. It spends the summer on the porch next to the front door which is south facing with a giant oak tree for shade\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qsqoutz5gq4e1.jpeg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=df87ec62167c14e14e92c38f227726b9ff2740c6\n\nLove this\n\nThose are beautiful!   How tall will they get?\n\nInteresting question! I only ever saw them as tall as picture here. Also love the white pebbles with it. So sad that’s not a choice for my climate\n\nI've seen them grown indoors to about twice the size\n\nI have some taller than five feet indoors.\n\nThe one I have in a pot has four-ft leaves. In its pot, it’s almost as tall as me, so reasonable front fence height, but not a visibility barrier\n\nWhaaaat. I want to get this\n\nProbably not the most scientific answer but I've seen them grow as tall as a toddler, a neighbor has some and I saw her granddaughter standing next to them.\n\nI have one about a year or two old that's already 4 feet tall.\n\n\nso how tall was that toddler?\n\nMan a snake plant fence would be amazing. Love that\n\nSnake plants expand outwards and they’re gonna mess up those bricks\n\nThank you! I can’t believe you are the only one I see saying that. These will hulk smash anything you put them in and take over everything. RIP this lawn in a few years.\n\nI don't see the problem.\n\nThis makes me very happy that snake plants can’t survive outdoors year round where I live.\n\nHow long did that thake to fill in?\n\nAnd also… How expensive was it to fill that in?\n\nThese are cheap , they are easy to grow.  Frequently they are pass along plants. Free divisions offered as folks divide their existing clumps.\n\nWay to go. Dominate your neighbors lawn! Looking good.\n\nIf you lived in the UK, you would make a killing by selling cuttings. I've seen people pay £20 ($25.40-ish) for a single cutting that is only around 8\" long.\n\nThey call them Dracaena now 😬😉 no more Sansevierias, it’s a history\n\nYou got downvoted for telling the new name?\n\nThey changed it in 2017. I can't keep it straight in my head yet! \n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dracaena_trifasciata\n\nNot very intelligent people, who are unable to appreciate new knowledge and information, often downvote nerds for no reason. If it helps them assert themselves, I don’t mind being a punching bag 😘\n\nThey're included in dracaena genus... Still sansevieria!\nRegarded as environmental weed in Qld &amp; NSW &amp; NT .🧐\n\n“Included”, but all Latin names have been changed to Dracaena 😉 Some nurseries still use the name Sansevieria because it is historically recognized by a wider range of people. But in botanical taxonomy, all sansevierias have become dracaena.\n\nThese look pretty damn fantastic, and the house and everything tied together, well done!  if you haven't already read, keep in mind you'll want to vertically trim those suckers so they don't fuck things up over time, snake plants will \"walk\" as they expand under the ground and eventually push through dirt, rocks, concrete, asphalt, whatever.  We maintained clients homes by trimming them by literally digging down in front or behind them where we didn't want them to spread.  Sharp shovel and straight up and down motion.  Worth it IMO because they can look so crisp and clean!\n\nWooooow 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻\n\nThat looks awesome. Am wondering how they overwinter and what zone you're in.\n\nYes, me too. What zone - wondering if I can do this…\n\nYou must live in a warm climate region.\n\nUnderrated landscaping plants.\n\nLove them. They're some tough plants.\n\nI really hate these plants... I still admire what you did with them. It's nicely done.\n\nRight, I don't like them either, but this is the best cultivation of them I've seen.  If everyone grew them in a good spot, with this level of care, I would like them more.\n\nNever heard that name before and I'm not talking about snake plant.\n\nDamn, that's such an awesome idea. Too bad my climate won't allow me to do this.\n\nNice my wife just killed three of those just by owning them lol\n\nI would dig out at least half of it annually since they keep multiplying. That way your brickwork doesn't get destroyed.\n\nAhhhhh this is a dream of mine! I adore how they look as a hedge. Looking good!\n\nHow do you maintain the cleanliness and its beauty? It looks amazing.\n\nYour front stairs make me nervous.\n\nYou must just have the perfect well-draining, sandy, neutral-to-slightly-acidic soil that it likes. Very neat. Personally I'm sort of a native plant purist but you've achieved a striking affect here which I admire, well done.\n\nI have heavy clay soil and these things pop up in my garden constantly left over from some 70’s planting. At first I thought it was harmless enough and then I had a bed of them… They seem to love everything. I’ve pulled them out and left them to languish on my gravel driveway for months and they still grow there with their roots laying out in the sun. \n\nI keep a few in pots now. I cannot understand when I see them retailing for $40-$90 at nurseries. These and agaves I’m constantly throwing out the front of my house and begging people to take them.\n\nAwesome!  Very nice\n\nDope!!!!\n\nI love this so much\n\nI wish I could do that here. very cool, 10/10\n\nGorgeous!\n\nthis is so satisfying\n\nOh wow it looks amazing. And it looks so healthy too! I used to see this plant as boring but it just looks so nice when used like this.\n\nthey'll kick your house and they'll make holes in your house\n\nCan you explain?\n\nsansevieria's underground \"branches\" are very vigorous. they break through pots like nothing else to do. so i do believe one day sansevieria will break in to the house\n\nThat sounds terrifying 🫠\n\nThis is truly gorgeous.\n\nWhat zone?\n\nI wish I could have that!!! Unfortunately I’m in the wrong zone…\n\nThat is so nice, great natural edge. They look like a queue of little green people waiting to go down the side way there.\n\nI love it!! Really nice!\n\nMust be Cali?\n\nThose look great! Good idea\n\nThat’s glorious\n\nDid this help with mosquitos?\n\nThat's impressive AF.  \n\nWell done mate.\n\nGorgeous 😍 \nAs someone who lives in a desert climate, I’m jealous.\n\nLove it. I would never have considered that.\n\nWow…. I am ENVIOUS!!!!\n\nWhoa! I’ve yet to see a set up like this. Very nice. 🌿\n\nwow i love this so much!\n\nI generally hate those but that is the best use I ever have seen of that plant. Nice job.\n\nBeautiful!!!! How cold does it get where you live? Are they cold hearty?\n\n😍😍😍😍😍\n\nYour house would look so cool in the sims!\n\nNice. I can’t get one plant to grow. Another died. What’s the secret\n\nWhat a lovely idea!\n\nGenius idea. Beautifully executed. 👍🏼\n\nthe fact that these are called MIL tongues take me out 🤣\n\nGORGEOUS!\n\nDamn I wish my climate supported this haha\n\nVery classy looking\n\nI would love to have this! It is so beautiful!\n\nThat's 😎 cool.\n\nCool concept.\n\nThe word is Hedge. A fence made of plants is a hedge ffs\n\nNice\n\nI love how the white rocks look alongside them!\n\nAwesome!\n\nI love it!\n\nThat looks awesome!\n\nGorgeous!\n\nOh la la. I love this.\n\nThis looks so beautiful!!\n\nIt looks good\n\nOh my mom would go nuts knowing you can do that! We had only 1, that's now in 3 pots ! Lol\nLooks great though ! Full and healthy.\n\n😍😍😍😍 great idea😊\n\nI love that!\n\nGlorious!!\n\nSnake plants are also great indoors because they can purify the air, but it shouldn't be that many though. ahhaha\n\nLove it!\n\nLove how this looks!\n\nPerfection\n\nHope you like them. They will not go away, easy.\n\nWow I’ve never seen them utilized like this! Of course I’m in Arizona and they wouldn’t survive the summers lol.\n\nI live in a city near Phoenix, AZ and I've found that mine are loving the outside. The direct sun during the winter is too much but filtered or brief, early sun seems favorable to the ones I'm cultivating. As long as I put them in the right soil and watering patten, they flourish. Anything not optimal and problems start snowballing.\n\nI LOVE THIS\n\n😍\n\nI'm impressed. I don't even like this plant, but this looks really cool.\n\nImpressive!\n\nquestion, one of my Sansevieria is turning white, any tips?\n\nBeautiful!\n\nTHIS!!!!! IS SO AWESOME!!!!\n\nSuperb\n\nI love this. I wish I lived in a climate warm enough to do one of my own\n\nYour neighbor will hate you in six months\n\nIs that a Jade in the neighbor’s yard?\n\nNice job! What’s the secret?\n\nI love it!\n\nI love this idea!!!\n\nThat’s so cool!\n\nI like it\n\nI’ve never seen it grouped like that- looks so cool.\n\nDang ✨ Oh to live somewhere that doesn’t go through all four seasons at once all year around-ish…\n\nThat looks so beautiful\n\nYou must have the cleanest air!!\n\nThe edges of the snakes tongue make the brick+mortar pop too, super cool effect\n\nI LOVE IT\n\nMine grow sooooo slow. They are inside. It’s too cold for them to be out in Chicago. But I must be doing something wrong because they hardly grow.\n\nWow in a planter bed…!? They must be old and done very well possibly with root binding\n\nThat looks great!!! It's a houseplant where I live, lol.\n\nIs that hard to maintain? Thats gorgeous\n\nY’know… I don’t think I’ve ever seen these outside of a pot\n\nI have never seen anything like this in my life.  It's absolutely beautiful!\n\nI have never seen this before, love it. Clean and well kept. Great job!\n\nLovely\n\nWhere do you live\n\n🫶🫶🫶🥰\n\nI hate it ngl. But then I don't really like the plant as it is. A whole hedgerow of them just really makes me uncomfortable lmao\n\ni wish i was in a zone that i can have that\n\nBEAUTIFUL!\n\nSick\n\nWonderful.\n\nPlanting those things by choice is mind boggling to me\n\nHow come?\n\nIncredibly invasive everywhere and on the short list of plants most govts beg people not to plant.  Also destroys all concrete near them, and is impossible to control the spread or eradicate.  \n\nAlso not attractive to the eye or wildlife"

    "all_comment_text": "That's corn smut, aka huitlacoche, and it's delicious! I'm jealous.\n\nReally????\n\nYes, it’s used in Mexican cuisine as far as I know, it’s a tasty mushroom.\n\nTastes like cornshrooms.\n\nTakes you on a trip to the distillery?\n\n“Come with me and you’ll see a world of corn manipulations”\n\nTake a bite and you’ll taste, a world of sweet amaizement\n\nThat pun is too corny.\n\nI'm still going to stalk his comment to see how many upvotes it gets...\n\nThat would be awesome. I’ll take one, thank you.\n\nI was going to post the same thing! It’s a fungi, like truffles, that involves precise conditions not normally found here. Around a decade ago it happened and restaurants went nuts over them - worth a lot of money\n\nCruffles?\n\nAbsolutely delicious in quesadillas\n\nI hade it in a ravioli with a corn bisque in Tulum and it was OUT OF THIS WORLD.\n\nThat sounds crazy good.\n\nMy man!!! I applaud your taste good sir\n\nAlso a lot of Native cuisines!\n\nCrops are inoculated specifically to get this result \n\nEspecially in Oaxacan cuisine. So good!\n\nIt’s a delicacy!\n\nI had no clue and I'm goggling it right now!\n\nHighly recommend them in a quesadilla if you end up doing it. This is a pretty eclectic dish but if you can do Squash blossoms + huitlacoche quesadillas...you're doing gods work.\n\nI have lots of squash blossoms!\n\nEverything's coming up Millhouse!\n\nThrillho\n\nMilpool\n\nSee you in the car!\n\nYou're set, enjoy!\n\nYou have lots of yummy snacks to make now!\n\nPlease invite us over when you make this\n\nWhen’s the quesadilla party!\n\nI made squash blossom quesadillas last night and told my wife I wish we were in Oaxaca where huitlacoche is common. Damn!\n\nNom nom nom... We're going to need an update about that heavenly dish!\n\nOmg I love stuffed squash blossoms!!!!\n\nSauteed with onion and garlic would do some magic then throw them in the quesadillas\n\nAbsolutely. I’m so sad that the only shop that offered this anywhere near me is now closed.\n\nI have seen they can be used in soups, stews, and even desserts. I wish places around me used it but have not found anywhere yet.\n\nI have been doing research on this in my free time. I have spore samples and I've been intentionally innoculating corn.\n\n\nIts a super interesting fungal growth and they are for sure a delicacy.\n\nUSA: Burns entire farms to the ground.  \n\nMexico: Intentionally infects crops hoping for a big payout come harvest.  \n\nIts so funny how cuisines differ across borders.  \n\nAlso different by time, eg. all the \"weeds\" we now spray with poison, which were intentionally and carefully brought to other countries by European immigrants.  Like plantain, mullein, dandelion, chickweed, lupins,\n\nThe fungi is rumored to stay into the soil and affect corn grown in the same land in next seasons.\n\n\"Crop rotation' is necessary. You don't grow corn in your space one year and the next. If you've got four different crops that you are growing you never grow the same plant in the same space you grew it last year because it depletes all the good nutrients that your plants/veggies need to grow healthy plants. \n\nA good example being you grow corn in your gardening space one year and the next year you grow something completely different; watermelons or lettuce, etc.\n\nHave a lot of farmers destroyed corn because it was growing huitlacoche? Or rather, have farmers in the U.S. never marketed a corn harvest gone to huitlacoche?\n\nHuitlacoche is not typically eaten in the US and would be likely be challenging to market to a broad US audience. Folks interested in Mexican cuisine specifically or people who are foodies in general may have heard of it, but it's not widely known and I've never seen it sold anywhere I've been throughout the US. Not to say it's not sold some places around the country, but it's definitely not common.\n\nYou'll find it in cans in some Mexican markets, but yeah. Westerners go \"rotten corn ew yuck\", Mexicans go \"los dioses nos regalaron los hongos especiales del maíz, somos hashtag blessed, guey.\"\n\nIt can be a problem in Mexico, too.  It all defines what your intent is, and what tools, storage, distributors, etc you have.\n\nCombine harvesters and grain silos aren’t ver useful for huitlacoche.\n\nIf you are a winemaker and end up with a bunch of vinegar, you are not going to be happy either.  Just don’t have a way to process, bottle, distribute it, or any real quality control etc.\n\nAfter you have finished goggling at it, look it up online.\n\nAsk Jeeves.\n\nIs that a new one? I am still using Alta Vista.\n\nYou’re incredibly lucky, a lot of people try and fail to infect their crop with this delicacy\n\nIt’s so goddamn good. Enjoy, OP!\n\nI think they replace the meat in a dish? Or is it the beans?\n\nThe top ones might be a slightly mature for eating, want to pick it before it starts making spores and gets kind dusty, the stuff at the bottom might be better.\n\nI had some today that grew on my corn, saute it with butter and salt, like a mixture of mushroom and corn with a hint of unsweetened chocolate in the aftertaste.\n\nGreat advice and I hope OP researches this further.  I do not know much about corn smut, but I do know that many edible mushrooms have inedible spores, so you have to pick them before they have started producing spores or else they will make you sick.  \n\nIf the top ones have gone to spore already I would personally stay away from the bottom ones too.\n\nI haven't heard anything about them being toxic when over mature, the taste and texture just isn't good.\n\nYep! [Huitlacoche](https://www.atlasobscura.com/foods/huitlacoche-corn-mexico)\n\nCongrats on hitting the biological lottery lol\n\nTry a huitlacoche quesadilla w chihuahua cheese and you’ll be in heaven. Shout out to CDMX for introducing this delicacy to me 🤤\n\nIt's a lot more valuable than the corn would have been actually. \n\nI worked at a fancy restaurant that sold this as a side\n\nOne of my favorite meals I've had in recent memory was getting a Mexican pork Wellington wrapped in the stuff.\n\nIt was freaking divine. And expensive.\n\nYour shittin on a gold mine!\n\nIt’s a delicacy. You might be able to sell it to local restaurants.\n\ncultivate it... maybe you can sell it for good money.\n\nIf it’s desirable, can it be seeded onto growing corn?\n\nYes, they can inoculate corn with this, that's how it's farmed.\n\nI read on another site where someone could not grow corn because the spores of this were in the soil prior to having lived there. Any insight about it being true?\n\nThere's many YT videos about just this - corn farmers intentionally inoculating their crop to yield a product worth a LOT more than regular corn\n\nStop smut shaming!\n\nLol smut shaming has me giggling 😂\n\nJust bought a can the other day. Except looks like they rebranded it as “corn mushroom”. It’s kind of sweet and odd tasting. But good\n\nIs it safe to eat off the husk?\n\nSo... NSFW?\n\nhttps://foragerchef.com/huitlacoche-elotes/\n\nLucky you! It's Huitlacoche, a type of corn fungi and a pretty expensive delicacy. People actually do this to their corn intentionally to farm it.\n\nI've never tried it yet but supposedly it tastes similar to black truffle.\n\nYou should do some more research into it and definitely try some recipes with it.\n\nI think I am! I feel like I found gardening gold now!\n\nYou definitely rolled for corn and won an epic reward\n\nWhen Farmville and Candy Crush combine\n\nNat 20!\n\nYes, yes you did.\n\nTake a sample of the mushroom and you get it next year as well :D see guides on YouTube\n\nYeah try to save some and keep growing it!\n\nAhhh why didn't I do this?! Had the same thing happen 2 years ago, on multiple stalks. I feel pretty dumb now..\n\nI only ever tried this once and it was amazing, it was in a chicken and mushroom quesadilla.\n\nthis is the garden version of finding a shiny Pokémon lmao\n\nYou did, huitlacoche is extremely expensive in most places.\n\nYes! The bad news is that the fungus stays in the ground for like.. ever. So while you I’ll get fancy corn, you probably won’t ever get regular sweet corn.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jymlbskm7ddd1.jpeg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=027762be0add95218e0315b3f9a6777260952be5\n\nlol that’s like saying “bad news, there’s a virus in your soil that only makes watermelons extra sweet, it can’t be cured and it has no effect on any other life form”. Literally the best bad news considering every store sells regular corn\n\nPokerus-ass development.\n\nYou did!! Super jealous, congrats\n\nIt's milder than truffle imo, but somewhat similar. It is delicious\n\nThey got the Iridium Quality Corn! (Stardew reference)\n\nMore like a corn flavored mushroom.\n\nWtf i throw my corns that become like this had no idea\n\nThe pain…\n\nI throw away all the shiny rocks I find when I mine dirt too :(\n\nIt doesn’t taste like black truffle at all imo. It’s good though.\n\nDoes it have a poisonous or non edible variety people should be aware of?\n\nWe eat it in a quesadilla traditionally in Mexico.\nSautéed with onions and poblano.\n\nThe gods shined on you!\n\n😂\n\nThis actually makes your corn more valuable. Make some huitlacoche quesadillas!\n\nMy corn did that 2 years ago.and I sold it to my local Mexican restaurants for good money.\n\nWhat is a fair price\n\nI was given 30 par ear. I planted 500 corn plants, and over 200 had the fungus on them. So I made around 6K for them.\n\nCongrats! I always love seeing folks hit unexpected windfalls…it’s like watching the universe smile upon someone. Did you prepare any? How did it taste?\n\nThe restaurant prepared some for us to try, and it was amazing! They made the quesadillas and a chicken dish with it in it.\n\ndamn, you cleaned up. Did it come back the next year?\n\nI am sure it would have if I'd of planted corn the next year. Planting corn by hand is hard work! Plus, this all came from my backyard garden.\n\nThat's huitlacoche, you can do a quesadilla with that\n\nOn a semi related note, apparently you can be allergic to corn smut, which I was not aware was a thing until i was reviewing a patients allergy list which included \"mold, penicillin, and smut\" and I had to try to figure out how in all hell one could be allergic to smutty literature without setting off my work computers search flags\n\nOmg 😂. This reminds me of when IT updated their search flags and oncology and urology among other departments could no longer do their jobs because the breast in breast cancer and the word penis got them automatically kicked off their internet. 🙄\n\nOh damn, I’m allergic to mold and penicillin 🤦🏾‍♂️ I suppose I should avoid corn smut.\n\nJust eat it outside of an ER and be ready to bolt inside if needed.\n\nOmg I LOVE Huitlacoche it’s amazing and I still remember my Oaxacan burrito filled with it that just makes my mouth water!!!!! Pure love\n\nImagine being the first guy to say, “fuck it, i’m eating it anyway”\n\nRight like this repulsed me on a primal level to look at. It’s horrifying. I would not have been the one to discover the  magic 😆\n\nEverything looks delicious when you on a brink of starvation\n\nIt literally makes my body hurt just looking at it.\n\n🤣\n\nI don't want to know how many \"delicacies\" originated as \"it's either this or starvation\"...\n\nMost\n\nPeople got pretty good at using their senses to detect whether a plant was edible\n\nYeah but mushrooms don’t play by the rules.\n\n\"Hey Bill, eat this and see if you die\"\n\nSmutty corn.\n\nI usually have to go to CornHub for my corn smut.\n\nDon't shame!  :)\n\nSmut - It's like finding truffles without having to dig\n\nYou lucky sunovagun.\n\nBecause it wanted to give you the best quesadilla you’ve ever had.\n\nAmazing! Yay! It’s the start of “wtf is on my corn?” season!\n\nIt's the most wonderful time of the year!\n\nThis is almost impossible to buy anywhere—a true delicacy\n\nThis thread is great, I was fully expecting it to be filled with comments warning op that they have trouble ahead, turns out they're lucky as heck instead!\n\nThat’s Mexican truffle gold right there\n\nGo to central Mexico and sell it!\n\nChefs in the US are looking for this. I've heard of some buying entire fields full.\n\nOh I know.  In Oaxaca and Mexico City it gets top dollar as well!\n\nI’m looking to score some spores next spring!\n\nLiquid culture would be ideal. That way you can skip the inoculation of spores. Which is where most mycology experiences contamination.\n\nLucky you! Time to make some huitlacoche tacos.\n\nwatch all of these positive comments be one huge inside joke and op eats the fungus corn and becomes a zombie\n\n😂🤣\n\nAh. The Diamonds of the Midwest.\n\nLucky bugger, you've got yourself one hell of a cob!\n\nr/uglyafcorn …but fr congrats on your huitlacoche!\n\nJealous. Always wanted to try that.\n\nI wish we could grow corn like that here. I’ve never had fresh corn smut ( huitlacoche).   Onlythe canned ones that real Mexican restaurants serve on tacos\n\nMexican grocery stores and some restaurants will buy that from you if you have any real amount of it. You can also let some go to spore and save them over the winter to reintroduce in a larger patch next year. It's quite valuable, much more than the corn is worth.\n\nBecause you won the lottery\n\nIt’s called huitlacoche in Mexico, put it in a pan with a bit of oil, onion and garlic and fill some quesadillas up. It’s been considered detrimental pretty much everywhere until many fine cuisine restaurants along the world understood why Mexicans like it.\n\nDon't listen to these people giving you good information. Your corn has the blight, and your family with surely starve come winter.\n\nOp please let us know if you make anything 🙂\n\nI tried the sauté in butter and garlic. It was not my jam sadly. Hubby liked it!\n\nPersonally, I didn’t think this tasted good all by itself.  But when I put it in a tortilla with cheese it was delicious!\n\nHuitlacoche, also known as the Mexican corn truffle, is an edible fungus that grows on corn and is a culinary delicacy in Mexico. It's been eaten in Mexico for centuries, and has a long history in the cuisine of the Aztecs.\n\nWisconsin Horticulture Division of Extension website.  \n[https://hort.extension.wisc.edu/articles/huitlacoche/](https://hort.extension.wisc.edu/articles/huitlacoche/)\n\nIve heard thats actually a good thing. Hopefully someone shares more info about it.\n\nMayas usted to call this,\" The food of the gods\" aka huitlacoche its still a delicacy to this Day mostly used in quesadilla, Im mexicana and I love huitlacoche really delicioso food\n\nI had no clue that would have been edible nevertheless appetizing, learned something new today! 😁\n\nYou lucky bastard!\n\nThat's gold right there. SO good!\n\nCook it up!!!! So good!!!!\n\nooohh. :O you got the gold.\n\nIt’s delicious. That’s what it is. Lucky you!\n\nYummy corn mushroom. Very prized\n\nHuitlacoche, chopped it add onion and epazote... Make some tacos... Watch videos on how to cook it. It's delicious\n\nI swear this needs to get pinned. I casually follow this sub and corn smut identification comes up so often.\n\nYou can sell that to Hispanic families in your area :) I have given a lot to friends.\n\nHuitlacoche, aka corn smut is a fungus growing on the corn. It is a delicacy in Mexican Cuisine. I believe Jeff Bayliss has a recipe for it.\n\nCorn smut is a plant disease caused by the pathogenic fungus Mycosarcoma maydis. One of several cereal crop pathogens called smut, the fungus forms galls on all above-ground parts of corn species such as maize and teosinte. The infected corn is edible; in Mexico, it is considered a delicacy, called huitlacoche,[5] often eaten as a filling in quesadillas and other tortilla-based dishes, as well as in soups.\n\nIt’s a delicacy\n\nYou hit jackpot. Now you have successfully farmed Cuitlacoche. Sell it for billions. Congratulations.\n\nYou hit fungus silver!!!\n\nBc truffles or oysters are gold lets be serious\n\nWow, that is awesome.\n\nYou won the lottery and I'm jealous\n\nWoah! You've got the Golden Goose of Corn!\n\nPeople love that stuff. I think it's called corn smut. Never had it but I hear it's good.\n\nits smut, a delicacy\n\nAhhhh huitlacoche!!! I am jealous!!\n\nBecause it's a smut slut\n\nThat’s a delicacy in a lot of places! Enjoy my friend! There’s plenty of recipes online!\n\nGo buy a lotto ticket, you won gardening!\n\nCook em with some tomato and onion, then add em to a quesadilla. The best! 🤌\n\nI never get tired of these posts. It’s fun watching someone come here thinking their corn is ruined only to find out they grew a secret crop\n\nBitch you lucky. If you threw it away, the devil is going to tickle your butthole at night with his pitchfork.\n\nMakes one hell of a quesadilla\n\nYou should take it to your local farmers market. Local restaurants will pay top dollar\n\nI am still upset that I tossed all of mine away when I was a noob gardener. I wish I knew. And now that I knew, my garden can’t grow these anymore. Just normal corns now. Weird thing to get upset about but I kinda am. lol I want these mushrooms! Not corn!! lol\n\nYou should def sell it to local Mexican food places. It can earn you a pretty penny if you don’t eat mushrooms. Heard it’s very good!\n\nCorn Smut?!!! Its a delicacy in Mexico.\n\nMake sure you take a bit and crumble it up around your garden so it can spread, perhaps you’ll get more next year.  Also take note of today’s temp/ weather and yesterday’s temp/ weather that way you know what the conditions are like for it to grow.\n\nThe fungus overwinters in the soil or on plant debris and infects corn plants through wounds or natural openings. The spores germinate in warm, moist conditions and infect the growing corn tissues. Infected kernels and ears are not suitable for consumption or sale in conventional markets. However, the fungus itself is edible and considered a delicacy in some cultures.\n\n\t1.Harvesting: Collect the huitlacoche galls when they are still young and tender, before they turn black and dry. They should be grayish-white and slightly firm.\n\t2.Cleaning: Gently rinse the huitlacoche to remove any dirt or debris. Pat it dry with a paper towel.\n\nCooking Methods:\n\n\t1.\tSautéed Huitlacoche:\n\t•\tIngredients: Huitlacoche, butter or oil, onion, garlic, salt, pepper.\n\t•\tSteps:\n\t1.\tHeat a pan over medium heat and add butter or oil.\n\t2.\tSauté chopped onion and garlic until translucent.\n\t3.\tAdd the cleaned huitlacoche and cook until it softens and releases its liquid, about 10-15 minutes.\n\t4.\tSeason with salt and pepper to taste.\n\t5.\tUse the sautéed huitlacoche as a filling for quesadillas, tacos, or as a topping for toast.\n\t2.\tHuitlacoche Quesadillas:\n\t•\tIngredients: Tortillas, sautéed huitlacoche, cheese (e.g., Oaxaca, mozzarella), optional ingredients (epazote, jalapeños).\n\t•\tSteps:\n\t1.\tHeat a tortilla on a griddle or skillet over medium heat.\n\t2.\tAdd a layer of cheese on one half of the tortilla.\n\t3.\tSpoon sautéed huitlacoche over the cheese.\n\t4.\tAdd any optional ingredients, such as epazote leaves or sliced jalapeños.\n\t5.\tFold the tortilla in half and cook until the cheese melts and the tortilla is golden and crispy.\n\t6.\tServe hot with salsa or guacamole.\n\t3.\tHuitlacoche Soup:\n\t•\tIngredients: Huitlacoche, chicken or vegetable broth, onion, garlic, corn kernels, epazote, salt, pepper.\n\t•\tSteps:\n\t1.\tSauté chopped onion and garlic in a pot until translucent.\n\t2.\tAdd the huitlacoche and cook for a few minutes.\n\t3.\tPour in the broth and bring to a boil.\n\t4.\tAdd corn kernels and epazote, and reduce the heat to simmer.\n\t5.\tCook for about 20 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld.\n\t6.\tSeason with salt and pepper to taste.\n\t7.\tBlend the soup for a smoother texture, if desired.\n\t8.\tServe hot, garnished with fresh herbs or a dollop of cream.\n\t4.\tHuitlacoche Tacos:\n\t•\tIngredients: Corn or flour tortillas, sautéed huitlacoche, toppings (salsa, avocado, lime, cilantro).\n\t•\tSteps:\n\t1.\tWarm the tortillas on a griddle or skillet.\n\t2.\tFill each tortilla with sautéed huitlacoche.\n\t3.\tAdd your favorite toppings, such as salsa, diced avocado, a squeeze of lime, and chopped cilantro.\n\t4.\tServe immediately.\n\nTips:\n\n\t•Huitlacoche can be frozen for later use. Just clean and portion it before freezing.\n\t•It pairs well with other ingredients like mushrooms, tomatoes, and various herbs.\n\nGood luck and enjoy !\n\nSmut it's actually more expensive than corn if you have a field of it call some of high end restaurants and the chefs will be all over it. Its a fungus so basically think of it as corn mushrooms lol\n\nhttps://mestizomarket.com/2020/12/18/huitlacoche/\n\nThat good ole corn smut\n\nInoculate your other ears! *Huitlacoche !*\n\nAin't that with la coochie?\n\nHuitlacoche! How lucky!"

This would be an awesome winter project up here in the US\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com.au/Strawberry-Pyramid-Planter-Plans-Illustrated-ebook/dp/B0719NSPH4\n\nWe used these plans! Should be easier to work with for you.. it was a pain in the ass doing trig to make the plans work for the timber cuts we could get here 🫠\n\nThanks! Don’t envy you having to convert from our mess of a measurement system haha\n\nAwesome! Thanks for sharing the plans 🙌\n\nThis seems like a more approachable take on something like an herb spiral. I can’t wait to make one of these. Great job 👏\n\nCame here for same (thanks OP!), I know what I'm doing this winter. Looks super fun :)\n\nFYI with some googling my gf found some free plans!\n\n[deleted]\n\nhttps://theownerbuildernetwork.co/easy-diy-projects/diy-strawberry-pyramid/\n\nI snort-laughed at the March 2024 picture. Fucking strawberries 😂 enjoy your harvest!\n\nLooks great! What variety did you plant?\n\nA few different ones but the one that took off is the red gauntlet. I can't remember what the others were.\n\nAwesome! I’ll have to see if that variety is available state-side.\n\nwow! Amazing. What did you do with your berry haul?\n\nSo far:\nStrawberry rhubarb compote \nStrawberry chilli jam\nStrawberry lime jam\nStrawberry milk flavouring \nSmoothies\nAbout 2-3kg frozen for future unknown purposes\n\nEvery year I dehydrate some, run them through a coffee grinder and keep them in jars or vacuum packs for yummy sprinkles in the off-season.\n\nYou can also add this ground dried strawberries to vanilla cake mix and make it a fresh strawberry cake, or to milk and make strawberry milk\n\nDehydrated strawbs are heavenly.\n\nI feel like these would go well garnished over a cocktail or powdered and made into a herbal tea\n\nSounds delicious\n\nStrawberry shortcake! Frozen is perfect for that bc they’re already mushy when they thaw.\n\nPLEASE dont forget ice-cream!\n\nI just found this…know it’s old. We make a strawberry rhubarb jam- it’s amazing…and holds well when frozen. Thanks for sharing- may do this year.\n\nCan someone illustrate why they are being grown like this ? i have only seen them grown as if a crop, in line on farms.\n\nFor drainage! On strawberry farms the rows are generally in mounds to achieve the same :)\n\nFor me it's because horizontal space is best saved. This on the ground would take up half the yard!\n\nalright thanks for the information. \nDo the bushes in the bottom layer get enough sunlight? \nas i see it the bushes all have roots in the bush house, but have spread around the yard correct?\n\ndo you only water the structure then is there a need to sprinkle where they've spread\n\nThey get enough light on all sides. I'd say most parts get between 4 and 8 hours a day. Some have roots in the planter but the ground ones have rooted themselves in the ground itself from runners off the original plants. The ground is also really dry and we'll draining in this spot so they're happy enough. I think the planter ones grow better because the berries can hang about without touching the ground.\n\none last question: i live in a place of humid climate with with a large range of temperature throughout the year from 10°C to 40°C . are strawberry plants robust enough to survive that and also do the plants get better with every Harvest in terms of quality and quantity of fruit and health of plant?\n\nNot sure I'm the best to advice on that climate. Canberra is like -5 to 45 but dryyyyyy so I don't have to deal with things like mildew etc. In terms of quality I would say the berries themselves are best year 2 onwards, yield you get more because the plants make you more plants! Apparently the quality reduces after the third year of ripening, I haven't noticed that yet with our older plants :)\n\nthank you for helping!\n\nNo problem, happy strawberrying\n\nStrawberries grow very well in the NE USA, where it is humid and has a large variation of temps in the year. So, they’re pretty tough.\n\nBut they don't overwinter outdoors, do they?  I'm in eastern Canada, I don't think I could grow something like this.\n\nThey absolutely do. Wild strawberries are native to eastern North America, including southern Canada. They are good to zone 4, but do better if you mulch them over the winter. We’ve tossed straw over them before.\n\nThe wild strawberries where I am don't overwinter, though, they just self seed.\n\nOh I'm watering there is a weeper house that gets the structure and the ground gets nothing but rain\n\nThey totally work. Optimal on a small scale. The concept of a strawberry pyramid has been around since before we were born.\n\nThe squirrels would see that as a buffet. 😠\n\nNo squirrels here. Lucky for me :)\n\nThat was going to be my question, how are you keeping the critters out? Lol.\n\nDog security 👮🐶 some bugs get to ground lying ones but not enough to make a dent. I'd imagine in a place with squirrels things would be more difficult 😂\n\nI live in the forested mountains of north central idaho. My property is covered with native strawberry, but the fruits, flavor packed as they are, only get to be about the size of a currant berry, and the fruits are difficult to get to before the myriad of furry critters we have do. My cultivated patch is doing well, but not thriving like yours is, because I am regularly challenged by chipmunks, voles, squirrels, mice, whistle pigs, and birds for the fruit, and deer get after the foliage. I have a close personal relationship with bird netting, lol.\n\nSorry to hear of your endless fight with the bountiful rodents of your region. From this I have learnt that groundhogs are also called whistlepigs which has brought me so much joy.\n\nEh, the challenges are what help you appreciate the rewards!\n\nSame goes with southwest Colorado. Tiny berries with huge flavor\n\nYes! Our little native strawberry is widespread! I had grand ideas about all the wild strawberries I was going to harvest at first. Then the chipmunks and I had a good laugh about that, and I planted my own, lol.\n\nYeah, my property is covered in wild strawberries, but I've never seen a single fruit.  They're gone before I can find them.\n\nSquirrels ate all my baby plants, now I grow tomatoes in my sunroom 🤣\n\nNo possum damage at all? They seem to love my garden 😢\n\nSomehow no?! We definitely have a resident possum. Maybe he's good at only taking what he needs..\n\nWhat zone are you in\n\nWe don't use zones like the US. Where I live the temp ranges from -5 to 45 Celcius and is dry if that helps\n\n That's about the range in most of southwestern US. It's encouraging that you're able to grow strawberries that well because I live in a dry climate and always thought they fry in the summer heat.\n\nThis is amazing! Question, do you guys have chipmunks and squirrels in Australia? Where I live (northern Michigan, USA), I wouldn’t be allowed to have even one tiny berry for myself. The Chipmunk Overlords would form their militia, and the Squirrel Squad would organize night operations for Operation Soul Destroyer (because of course they wait until I’m just ready to pick my first one). Then the deer would eat the leaves.\n\nNot chipmunks and squirrels. We have other rodents but they are rarely visible. Possums and birds would usually be a bigger problem for this thing but for some reason ours is left alone 🤷🏻‍♀️\n\nNo deer either (at least where I am now, we had deer when I lived in Wollongong). Lucky to be having a relatively pest free time of things.\n\nIf the birds ever do hone in on your crop, paint rocks like strawberries. When birds go to pick at them, they'll hurt their beaks (not too badly) and leave your berries alone when they do begin to ripe since they'll think those are hard too.\n\nThen the deer would eat the leaves - here in Virginia they just pull the whole plant up out of the ground, chew it to heck and spit it out.\n\nI have the same little ornament!\n\nI need to get a new one. The light broke in ours and I loved seeing it out the window at night.\n\nThe lighthouse of the strawberry patch haha\n\nAll hail the elder god, s̴̨̛͚̼̙̤̀̅͋͋̋̒ṯ̶̨̢̪̞̞͕͈̻̝̜̙͛͛̋͒͒́̊́̋͌̈́̕r̷̨̛̦̭͚̪̩̻͌̓̽́̿̓́͊́̋̇̂̽̋̈́̕͝ą̶̝̞̦͇̥͎̦̾̈́͗̊̇͜ͅw̵̧̧͔̱͓̳͇͖͎̺̘͇̫͓̖̘͚̦̞͂͗b̸̖̠̲̗͉̺̰͈̟̈́̽̆̽̓̂͆̈́̎̒̚͝e̸̛͇̐̄́̈́͛̐́̌̀͋̊̾̀̓́̀͌̚r̷̹̔̈́̈̐̄͋͛̔͂̕̚͘r̵̫͕̮̳̎͆̑͋͑̽̇́̅̂͂̓̿̌̕͝y̶̼̹̺̣̤̝̮͐̍̏͑̃͜ ̶̢͕̬̰̪̮͎͕̼̖͇͈͔͗̒́̉̌̊̎̆̎̋̀̚̚͠ͅṣ̶̪͔̤͓̜̓̾̎́̄͛̂͌͝ͅḥ̴̻̙͒͒̐̉͝ő̴͕̩̥̯͖̯͙̖̻̑̌̎̾̆̀̈r̵̨͓̲͍̻͚̘͕̼͚͖͑̇̀̽̈́͋͗t̴͈̪͓̹̱̣̩̫̞̖̪̙̘̗̪̳̂́̅̉̈̈́̈́͛̏̕͜͠ͅc̸͈͈͕͔͍̹̣̩̳̖̿̀̆̕å̸̢̧̢̧̤͇̥̯̰͚͚̤̦̰̠͖͐̽͑͆̏̅͗͂̓̀̍̋̄̕͜͝k̶̠̟̼̯͉̮̟̓̀́͌͑̄̎̊̀̇̊͒͝e̷̹̖͚̜̙͉̘̣̲̩̝͖̺̖͙̾̍̊͂̈́̄ͅ\n\nIn all seriousness though, this is fantastic!! Congrats on your lifetime supply of scrummy looking strawbs\n\nAlso: if you can get your hands on some rhubarb, it pairs lovely with strawberries for jams and pie fillings ❣️🍓\n\nItd be funny if it was like my aunts strawberries. She lived near a forest with a stream nearby. \n\nShe planted them in a pot and took care of it . She got a lot of harvests but then she had to go the hospital and be confined for 7 months.\n\n When she returned, The strawberries survived and managed to take over the entire garden. We live in a place with no winters or snow so thats kind of amusing. Now we go to her House for strawberry picking because damn, that place is full of it.\n\nStrawberries are fucking weeds... you have to keep a VERY close eye on them or they will spread like wildfire... best to hang them like two meters up in the air that nothing would touch the ground... or cut the whiskers like every two weeks...\n\nYup 😂 we sold about 150 runners just before the growing season and it's still lush as!\n\nI have 12 bushes in two tall planter boxes... it takes so much time to keep them behaving... next spring I intend to add another box with six plants, I hope I will manage to keep up. I also have white forest strawberries but those are hanging in a pot and even then, I still found several seedlings already rooted in the ground, maybe I lost a whisker when trimming or smth... in our vegetable plot that is right next to my neighbour's plot I constantly have to rip out rogue strawberries that do not even grow berries as they gone wild, but they just take territories and neighbour do nothing about them.\n\n[deleted]\n\nGood and sweet :)\n\nOMG I am a fiend for strawberries … this is my literal dream 🤩\n\nDAMN OKAY THE ONLY PYRAMID SCHEME I CAN ACTIVELY GET BEHIND!!! 👏👏👏👏\n\nWell done!! This is so creative!!!\n\nCan't take credit for the design, I shared the link for the plans in another comment. It's very excellent though!\n\nFantastic work, your patch is super healthy looking!\n\nDo you do any type of fertilizer or what type of soil did you use? I've never gotten a strawberry much bigger than a fingernail.... But they always taste fantastic. I'd love to give some a dedicated space to see if they'll grow better. Do you ever add new seedlings? Or do the runners just keep taking off and you let them go?\n\nDo you lose a lot to birds? We have gangs of Rosellas and Cockatoos that eat all our fruit!\n\nNo, but I'm fairly sure our dogs have something to do with that...\n\nHow do you deal with the fact that not all four sides will receive equal sunlight?\n\nWe originally only planted out two sides because of the sun issue but it just crept its way to the dark sides (fence side and on the right of most of these pics). The only thing I've noticed is that those sides fruit a couple weeks later than the sunny sides. \nSo uh I guess we've just been lucky to not have to deal with it.\n\nThat makes sense. I might do this but have it be just a one-sided ramp rather than a pyramid and see how it works out\n\nCool! Did you have to cut off the runners once the strawberries started flowering or you just let it go?\n\nAt the end of winter we yank off as much of the dead leaves as possible and break the runners :)\n\nIt's absolutely beautiful! Amazing! I wish I could grow strawberries in my zone, but they don't do well - too hot here. I am very jealous of your glorious strawberry ziggurat. 😁\n\nThat's so cool I may try that. Do you have troubles with birds stealing or other pests?\n\nIncredible success! Congratulations! I tried growing strawberries but could not compete with the slugs.\n\nImpressive! We get zero strawberry production due to a couple of rabbits.\n\nIt’s all fun and games till you can’t reach the pyramid and more hahaha. Looks great thought good job!\n\nNgl we're getting to that point. It's gymnastics to get to some spots\n\nJFC, my strawberry pyramid fell apart in after 2 years and all I could harvest was maybe 15-20 strawberries. Back to the garden bed you go!\n\nSad :(\n\nI just peed a little in excitement.\n\nDo you not have squirrels or chipmunks where you live!?\n\nStrawbyramid was right there! Always go for the portmanteau!\n\nIt's breached containment!\n\nOh Great Strawberry Pyramid, bless us with thy bounty...\n\nI saw a strawberry pyramid fountain in a gardening magazine years ago and I’ve never been able to find anything like it since. I’ve been dreaming about one for years, I was even thinking of it today and this pops up!! Wow! Thank you for this post 😄!! I’m going to make one\n\nThis is SO cute. 🥰 \n\nAlso, how do you keep pest away from them? I can’t seem to keep mine alive 🫠\n\nThis is the coolest thing I’ve ever seen\n\nHello? I think I'm in love\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mwkh4jrv0x1e1.jpeg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d77645686d3f83b1160273815f6e8e2bbc034145\n\n❤️\n\nPiece on top purpose ?\n\nOne must house the strawberry fairy gods in tiny strawberry houses for a good harvest. ;-)\n\nIt is working so far 👀\n\nWould that keep predators away from eating strawberries and their leaves especially bunnies and squirrels\n\nTo be cute 🍓\n\nLooks like it does something or attracts pollinators etc\n\nHow do you handle the squirrels and chipmunks?\n\nLive in a country without them ;)\n\nwoah\n\nNoooo waaaaay! That’s a dream!!\n\nThis is so awesome!\n\nWooow now I want one!\n\nThis is amazing\n\nOmg this is beautiful!\n\nLooks fantastic!\n\nDid you use pressure-treated lumber? and what was your approx build cost?\n\nWe used H3 treated pine, I think H4 for the lowest piece. It was around $150-200 AUD to build from memory!\n\nQuestion for you - I only get really tiny strawberries, what I am doing wrong?\n\nGenerally, size correlates to water intake leading up to and during the fruiting process. Size doesn't equal taste though. That's why store strawberries are huge but bitter also why store strawberries are usually very white on the inside, they over saturate them with water when they start to fruit.\n\nI'll take tiny and sweet over big and bitter any day. \n\nYou could try dead heading some of your flowers pre-fruiting so more energy goes into the fruit from the rest of them.\n\n\nSomeone feel free to correct me if I'm off base here. I'm not a strawberry expert, but I've always known this as the general fruit advice.\n\nIt's impossible to say without knowing anything about your growing conditions or what you've tried unfortunately. As a rule from my experience focus on the sun, drainage and circulation needs of these plants. As the other commenter pointed out, size isn't everything. Our best tasting fruit is the smaller/medium sizes, not the huge ones!\n\nWhat a dream!!! Great job!\n\nIt’s the movie The Ruins! But mini\n\nCould you share how often you water? What do you feed your plants and how often? Amazing btw to see this.\n\n\nAlso, is there a specific reason you guys chose that shape to grow your strawberries in?\n\nWater daily. We have a weeper hose set up for our whole garden. It gets a decent soaking once, sometimes twice a day (it's hot and dry where we live). Chose these plans because I'd never had any success in pots and was trying to focus on the drainage need of strawberries. I also knew I wanted a lot without it taking over the entire yard. Although sprawling this thing only takes up a smallish corner of the space we have. Leaving more for the rest of our veggie patch and the dogs to run about :)\n\nI finally found a shrine that’s worth worshipping\n\nI LOVE THIS\n\nthis is my stepson's dream!!!\n\nHow do you get rid of mildew 😭 I had it all over my strawberry leaves\n\nHaven't had any! We live in a dry climate and one of the perks of this set up is that the drainage and circulation is excellent so it hasn't come up :)\n\nwow, absolutely love this idea!\n\nOmg beautiful!\n\nWow, perfect solution for a bountiful yield in a small space!  👏🏻👏🏻\n\nDef stealing/borrowing this design\n\nThis is a thing of beauty.\n\nHow cool is that?! Wow. I just have a tiny little pot full of strawberries … no strawberries this year though lol.\n\nLOVE THIS\n\nFan-tab-u-lous!\n\nStealing this idea :)\n\nGlorious\n\nAdding this to my list of projects for next spring so cute\n\nWhat type of strawberry did you plant and what zone are you in please?\n\nThat’s awesome!  I’m stealing this idea\n\nAny lessons learned from your construction? \n\nI notice it looked like the stain faded pretty significantly over the season (no offense), but that’s expected with any outdoor wood let alone a planter. Did you consider sealing or was there a reason why you didnt? Any other advice?\n\nIt looks beautiful and id love to try and replicate\n\nWe didn't stain it. It was just treated pine straight from Bunnings. Didn't do anything because it was already treated. Construction wise, having a power tool that can accurately do mitre cuts is ideal, we had to do all the measurements and cutting the old fashioned way and it took forever. Other than that the plans I attached are excellent and the only problems were difficulty with imperial to metric conversions and the trig that ensued.\n\nAwesome i appreciate the tips\n\nLooks like I got myself a winter project\n\nNow this, I must do this for next year\n\nI never thought I needed a strawberry pyramid until now! 😍🍓\n\nBRILLIANT IDEA! 💕 👍\n\nNot gonna lie, initially I thought that was some sort of beholder or cthulu-esque strawberry monster when I first scrolled by. \n\nLove the pyramid though.\n\nGenius!  I don’t get strawberries from\nThe store because of all the poison. Def growing from home this way next year!   Great post!\n\nJam, marmalade, sun-dried, sorbet, kombucha, kefir soda, lacto-ferments, sauces, and freeze-dried.\n\nWant to know what your soil is. The only home garden I've seen great strawberries in she had them like in 50% homemade compost! I tried plastic strawberry jars and drip watering without much success.\n\nIt was something from a local soil and gravel supplier called \"compost soil\" which is apparently a \"Blend of sandy top soil and organic compost\". I think we mixed in extra...stuff (I really can't remember much) as it wasn't great quality. We needed the best part of a cubic metre to fill it.\n\n😍😍😍😍\n\nVery cool technique !!\n\n🍓🧑‍🌾👩‍🌾👨‍🌾 impressive!\n\nThat's cool as fk!\n\nMay have found a new project, might just go 2 high though 😂\n\nOh, it’s a strawberry\n\nBrilliant!!\n\nHow do you keep the pests away?\n\nWhat's your secret?\n\nHow do you keep the birds from eating them?\n\nWith what did you treat the wood so it dont rot?\nLooks awesome!!\n\nAdd 8 wader ones to the bottom and make a walking pirámid strawberry jelly\n\nFrom my experience you need to trim them regularly and make sure that they get enough sunlight. Additionally, older plants stop producing or the taste is not right. I understand that you are happy but what you're showing is not a good example of how to grow strawberries.\n\nWe do trim and these plants are not old as we get new runners every year and the taste is as good as ever. They also get enough sunlight... obviously or they would not grow well.\n\nAll right 👍"

Thank you for sharing &lt;3\n\nGourdgeous*\n\nIt's the best thing I've seen today\n\nlove this little photoshoot hahaha congrats on the harvest!!\n\nCan we make this a thing!?  I need mini shoots of people posing with their vegetables.\n\nFor real, this made my day!\n\n[removed]\n\n[removed]\n\n[removed]\n\nMy pumpkins ain’t pumpkining. Seeing your joy is appreciated. Thank you for sharing.\n\nI wish you could benefit from the pumpkins I planted at a friend’s house. None of them were the small pie pumpkins they were supposed to be and have fruited prolifically. We keep joking we should have a pumpkin festival at her house for neighborhood kids, I’m fairly certain we’ve at least got 10-15 full sized pumpkins right now\n\nNeither are mine!  I keep talking nicely to them and asking them to do SOMETHING but nada.  Nothing.  😩\n\nSame!! I got one female flower all season, and even that died and fell off before it bloomed 😭\n\n[removed]\n\nLove your outfit and your pumpkin!! You 100% have the energy of someone I’d like to be friends with! Great pics!!\n\n[removed]\n\nLove love love this!!\nBut exactly what kind of squash is it?\n\n“Green Kabocha Squash\n\nKabocha squash is squat and round, and similar in size and shape to buttercup squash, although the base points out. It has a dull finish with dark green skin that sometimes has small lumps, and bright yellow-orange flesh. It’s remarkably sweet with a nice nutty flavor, and texture that’s similar to a blend of sweet potato and pumpkin. Kabocha squash is very versatile and can be used as a substitute for almost any other winter squash. It can be roasted or steamed, added to soup, or used for a pie filling.\n\nBuying and storing: Look for a squash with dull coloring that’s firm and heavy for its size, and free from soft spots. Store it in a cool, dry place for up to one month.”\n\nThat's not a kabocha. The stem is too thin, the skin is too smooth, and there are no light green stripes that are common on kabocha. I'm not certain what it is (maybe an under-ripe pumpkin?), but it's not a kabocha.\n\nLooks like kabocha to me.  I've got half of one sitting in my fridge right now that looks almost identical.\n\nI have a whole one right in front of me. Not even close.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4kfh5nwxmtnd1.jpeg?width=4000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d664901ccc335c9734374cc16758b273c22ea96b\n\nYes, that's also a kabocha.\n\nThat is a kabocha. The one in the post is not. Also. OP said it's a pumpkin.\n\n&gt; OP said it's a pumpkin\n\nIn my experience, these kinds of squash are universally called \"pumpkins\" in the West Indies.\n\nKabocha is a type of pumpkin.\n\nCame for the pumpkin, stayed for the outfit. 🔥\n\nOver here laughing and crying because I got a single acorn squash small enough to fit in the palm of my hand. \n\nCongrats on your harvest! (I'm not at all jealous lol)\n\nIt sounds like a candidate for r/mightyharvest !\n\nLol I thought about it! I'll definitely do it if I can remember later.\n\nI thought it was a huge weird acorn squash because of the color, shape wrong but oh well,  enjoy your single squash, I have zero lol\n\n[removed]\n\nYasss it's *gourd*geous\n\nAngry upvote.\n\nThat look of satisfaction 🥰\n\nWoo woo! Great veg &amp; beautiful outfit. Is that your gardening outfit or your pumpkin outfit? Love it! ❤️\n\nOh nice!!\n\nCongrats, nice work!! and I am obsessed with your outfit.\n\nHow exciting!\n\nwow! great job. my pumpkins just rotted\n\nGarden and garden goddess\n\nsick pick of the day but honestly those jammie’s are killin it! sooo cute\n\nhonestly can't tell which is cooler, the squash or the pattern on your shirt/pants!!! 🤩\n\n👏👏👏\n\nMy compost gave me hella butternut  squash this year!

Almost looks like the stem is a bit coy put on the second picture 😂 (And your skin... I'd like to swim in your brand of moisturizer for a wee bit)\n\nThat's just the glow of someone who successfully picked a squash before the squirrels got to it.\n\nWhat are you going to make with it? 🎃\n\nBeautiful 👍\n\nYou look so happy 😊 congratulations!\n\nWe need to make posing with our harvests/flowers a thing.\n\n🥳\n\nNice!!! 👍\n\nLove love love\n\nGreat job!!!\n\nI love the fit and omg what a nice lil punkin!\n\nIs that a pumpkin?\n\nLove the energy!

Plus there is another pumpkin on the same vine and I wanted that one to get more nutrients, by removing this one.\n\nI have Jamaican friends that give me these and have taught me how to cook them (and Callaloo as well!) Ans this is what a ripe Jamaican pumpkin looks like.\n\nIt does right?  I am Jamaican also, It was an accidental growth from my compost soil i make. I think it is from one of the seeds when I made soup.\n\nLove callaloo! Heading to Antigua next week and cannot wait to have the fresh veg and fruit there. Nice harvest!\n\nYou look like you’re in your natural habitat, wonderful photos!!\n\nHow did it make it out unscathed?\n\nYes.

I'm growing my first vine this year. Good job\n\nI need you to make this a daily thing, I love your energy and your photos!\n\nLovely Pumpkin/squash and lovely outfit!

I’m in awe. Seriously. Amazing stuff!)\n\nthese melons break necks lol\n\nAbsolutely!\n\nWhat's wrong with a good fish?\n\nYou're not supposed to water them 2-3 days before harvesting them. To make them taste sweeter. My uncle used to be a watermelon farmer\n\nits been raining for a while here so idk just not that good timing on that watering part\n\n“I carried a watermelon”\n\nmy immediate thought 😭\n\nAm I old haha\n\nMe too 😂\n\nLook at my previous posts\n\nIt’s a reference to a scene in the movie dirty dancing :)\n\nOH! lol\n\nBet you're glad you didn't have to deliver that like a baby\n\nI thought it was a cucumber at first I was so afraid 😭\n\nI wanted to say I was pretty sure cucumbers couldn't be 44 lbs, but that got me wondering if that was actually the case\n\nAccording to my Google search the heaviest recorded cucumber was 29.5 pounds which is still quite the chonker\n\nWas searching desperately for this comment, had to make sure I wasn’t the only one 😅😅😅\n\n😂😂😂\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iigpaxdaf86e1.jpeg?width=2448&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6acedf5f23955ed408d33184a0d6aab61a9c7250\n\nMy dad grew this a few years ago. As big as my thigh at that time\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8esspkku6j6e1.jpeg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=280d9416d420c73d6672d7ff43d88bff746f3fe9\n\nThat’s awesome! I grew my own vegetable garden for the first time over the summer and to commemorate my longest cucumber I took this photo of it next to my cat\n\nThe bibs are damn fitting for the occasion\n\nThe title of this post is incredible.\nAlso great job!\n\nThanks\n\nMy dude! The next time you have 44 pounds of watermelon, LMK and I will be there to help you eat it!!\n\nHow much square footage did this take to grow in the garden?\n\nWell the vines do spread like 5 feet\n\nOmg please post in r/absoluteunits\n\nooh okay will do\n\n#watermelooooong\n\nMan that’s incredible! What variety? Watering regimen?\n\nI think it was just some walmart seeds\n\nsoon its time to track down some heirloom seeds, some small globe watermelons or some old timey ones that taste freakin amazing or maybe an orange or yellow fleshed melon!  \n\nregardless great freakin work, save some seed for next year if you can!\n\nim saving them all, hell im actually thinking of sending some to yall on here lol i need to look into how to preserve and package them\n\nHaha, love it!  You're on the right track then!  I always spit them up, wash them in water, then dry them on a towel in a sunny space indoors for a day or two, make sure they are dry then ziplock bag until planting next season.  I don't save seed for more than 2 years, mostly to cut down on clutter but also working with fresher seed is usually ideal!\n\nHow’d you keep critters from eating it?\n\nI killed them every time i saw bugs chewing on them, i had other melons die because they were getting eaten first, this one got lucky to grow big enough to resist small bites\n\nDang, that’s a big melon! Congrats! 🙌 \n\n“And this last pic…is _for the ladies_.”\n\nDid not know Ron Jeremy was a gardener.\n\nHe knows his way around a hoe\n\nIve been told i look like keanu reeves tho lol\n\nYou look like Chong in this pic.  How high were you eating that melon…\n\nvery high lmao\n\nGood work! You should have a watermelon party, or if you're into moonshine, watermelon brandy\n\nThat’s an alien pod. Everyone knows that\n\nits a dino egg lol\n\nImpressive melon! What breed is it?  \n  \nJuice is important in a watermelon for sure. I'd probably sooner have a juicy, under-sweet watermelon than a sweet, dry watermelon, or a sweet watermelon with spongy texture.\n\nSecond picture from the back made me feel like I was about to watch an obscure film about gardening starring Adam Driver.  Annnnddd. We’re back reality.\n\nBro they need so much water but idgaf\n\nthey do require a lot\n\nHoly cannoli Batman, that’s a big melon\n\nr/absoluteunit\n\nFuckin’ L O V E watermelon. I actually spoke to the half I was eating last night drunk as shit thanking it for existing, lol. Twas magical.\n\nTom Savini grows a melon.\n\nmy list of look alikes keeps growing as well lol\n\nAmazing! Looks delicious.\n\nYay! 44 lb watermelon? That’s amazing. I bet it tastes great!\n\nIt’s so glorious\n\nSo jealous\n\nThank you for sharing you delicious melon with us\n\nGreat job\n\nGood work!\n\nWowza what a load!!!\n\nI don't really like watermelon but I love growing them, they are spectacular! Nice melon sir!\n\nI’m so proud of you\n\nthanks\n\nBravo!  Nice job 👍\n\nDamn thing’s so big it can’t ever all fit into a single photo\n\nMoby huge\n\nLong live Lord Mellon!\n\nNot gonna lie I would demolish that\n\nMake yourself a crown from the rind, because you’re the king of watermelon.\n\nNice melon MARIO. Lol\n\nShe's chonky\n\nGood grief! That's impressive! What's the opposite of r/MightyHarvest?\n\nMy brother congrats for such a wonderful harvest. What's the secret to grow something this big?\n\nplant watermelon in june/july where theres good soil and where it doesnt get to much direct sunlight, a lot of water and maintenance because bugs will eat them\n\nNice!!\n\nTime to bust your best dance loves now!\n\nit’s. so beautiful. congratulations\n\nthanks\n\nOMG!! It’s so refreshing to see watermelon seeds inside of a watermelon!!! Haven’t seen that in ages!! (Which is sad now that I think about it) Kudos OP!!\n\nMy first thought was that it probably didn't taste very good.\n\nThat’s me but not me \n\nNice\n\nWow\n\nNom nom!\n\nSO COOL!! The swirls in the melon remind me of that painting by Giovanni Stanchi that shows us what watermelons looked like before selective breeding - so so neat!!! \n\nALL HAIL MELON LORD\n\nWell done! I like the fit, too\n\nDutch from RDR if he finally moved to Tahiti and grew fruits.\n\nWow! Just wow!😁😁😁👍👍👍\n\nWhat variety of watermelon did you grow?\n\njust walmart watermelon seeds whenever they bring in those big ones for sale\n\nMe and my kids labored over our watermelon vines all summer. And received one melon the size of a gumball. That surprisingly tasted ok. Amazing melon growin!\n\nthey need a lot of water, which was perfect for me because of hurricane season in my area\n\nThat’s actually a good tip. I had it on the very edge of the garden and would forget to water haha\n\nDude you look like my red dead character. I feel the need to make him more respectable now. 😂\n\nDefinitely a chill dude if I ever seen one\n\nim just a chill guy that likes to garden\n\nSame dude same\n\nWell done! By the way, do you like your overalls? If so, what brand are they? I've been looking for a good pair of overalls.\n\ni got them at forever 21 lol the fit and feel pretty good, its supposed to be part of a stylish fit but i think it fits gardening habits better\n\nBeautiful!\n\nThe melon, it is fantastic. But may I say that the real deal in these pics is the watch. Love it\n\nthis casio never leaves my wrist\n\nYum!!!!!!\n\nAre there any references to dirty dancing? I can’t even find watermelons that look like this anymore. \n\nDang son! What’d you feed that thing! Looks awesome. Well Done!\n\nGardening Crocs for the win!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/985frzzevz5e1.png?width=500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=808b883392d1ed780495832ed038e6312262fd61\n\nGood job.  I’ve tried growing melons but they never take.  Maybe my northern climate?  Maybe my soil.\n\nboth, it needs sunlight not direct sunlight and warmer climate with a lot of water\n\nfor a hot moment I thought this was the godfather of all back yard zucchinis\n\nSomeone else was frightened that it was a giant cucumber lol\n\nAbout 40lbs worth.\n\nHell yeah\n\nAwesome!!!\n\nGyad dahmn\n\nI could go for some watermelon right now but it's december.\n\nDaaaamn that melon is chonky AF!\n\nMy second time of growing melons I’ve gotten a whopping 60lbs\n\nI want a 44 lb melon!!!!!\n\nI bet a person could make a hundred gallons of sweet red wine from the biggest watermelons on the vine…\n\nHelp yourself to some, but obey the law.\n\nIf you drink, don’t drive- Do the watermelon crawl!\n\nIt's good to see watermelon with actual seeds in them again\n\nAmazing job good sir!\n\nI thought that first picture was Julian from trailer park boys\n\nOh HELL yeah. Awesome melon.\n\nthicc\n\nLast photo has heavy Gallagher vibes\n\nWow you are a watermelon whisperer! Great job!\n\nwell i was petting my melon and smacking it thru out the year so maybe that love helped it grow so big lol\n\nGood for you! Totally amazing!\n\nHope you’re inviting your neighbors\n\nDamn, that is AMAZING!!!!\n\nCongrats Friend! That’s excellent!\n\nGo forth and be fruitful!\n\n...I half expect for you to tell us (the majority having - minus rind - netted only 6 oz of actual fruit :per: $30 of gardening products, 4 hours of strategic small animal-proofing and multiple 15-minute sessions of hand-pollinating by tiny paintbrushes) that this was a volunteer fruit from the one-and-only seed that the neighbor's 9 year-old spit over the fence and into your yard 4 months ago.....\n\nI feel you, dude. I grew watermelons successfully for the first time this past summer. They were sugar babies, so not nearly as big, but I felt like a garden goddess when they were ready to pick.\n\nThat's pretty cool! What did you do to achieve such a large melon? Compost, special fertilizer, anything different?\n\nnear the roots of a dead pine tree and lots of water, this is my second time growing fruit like that so idk the actual science so i cant tell you more :/\n\nSounds like it got lots of nutrition! Great job man!!\n\n‘I carried a watermelon’\n\nIt'a literaly the same. Did you steal from Gromit?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dwe068zkq46e1.jpeg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6e590c9f2323be55ca7153a92f5caa522a186adb\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lf5p3sqgc96e1.jpeg?width=735&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c12a651a10591cc5a60e10bbe15423f2ea7981ed\n\nLook at them beans!\n\nIt’s a song by Johnny Cash you guys god"

    "all_comment_text": "very beautiful.  Are any of these ones edible or just decoration?\n\nAll edible! This corn makes for some amazing tortillas!\n\nI'm going to place my bets that they come out a light warm purple?\n\nThat would be so pretty. I’m guessing a medium brown.\n\nThat color when you mix all your watercolors together\n\nPlease pics of tortillas?\n\nPlease!! I’m dying to see how these come out\n\nI'd love to see that.\n\nThis is so exciting! How do you grind them? Do you nixtamalize them?\n\nYes i nixtamalize them, and grind them with thuis antique hand grinder. \n\nTruste me the tortillas, and corn Bread are amazing!\n\nWhat colourrrrrr does it come out??\n\nHopefully OP updates us after he uses this first one and finds out!\n\nI'd like to imagine OP makes their kids sort the kernels by color so they can get rainbow tortillas\n\nWhat does it taste like?\n\nNutty like a Cross between regular corn and chestnut\n\nI learned a new word today. Nixtamalization\n\nRoseRed Homestead on YouTube has a video on nixtamalization. I like to note that it has \"tamal\" in the middle of the word.\n\nRainbow tortillas? 🌈 👀🥰😂 yesss please\n\noh wow i can only imagine 😅\n\nIn the end, what did you called this breed? It's soooo beautiful!!\n\nWel Thank you so much! Still not quite sure what to name it. \n\nWorking name now is Nebula Casade, its has a nice ring to it. But still not completely satisfied.\n\nVery beautiful, very powerful.\nVery beautiful, very pooowerful.\n\nSorry I had to! You comment reminded me of that weird AI Tiktok XD\n\nCould I pay you for some seeds? I'm trying to collect unique varieties of corn to keep genetic varieties alive. I would love to know how you bred this variety!\n\nWell i hope to start selling this year! But lest See how the harvest goes. \n\n\nMy main goal here is that people will take this corn and make it suitable for their local climate.\n\nThis!!! So many people don’t realize when buying seeds that they have to raise a generation or two and save seeds from the healthiest plants to acclimate the cultivar to their specific climate. \n\nThe seeds might have been harvested from some controlled climate greenhouse for generations. So they wouldn’t have been exposed to environmental stressors that would trigger epigenetic responses in the parents.\n\nThis is new information to me, thanks for posting!\n\nIt was new information to me a year ago. Happy to help!\n\nHow do I save corn seeds?\n\nCorn. The kernels are the seed. So dry it out. Knock the kernels off the cob. Jar or bag. And save.\n\nI f**king love this sub. I had no idea. This makes me incredibly happy.\n\nSelective breeding\n\nThank you for sharing this information, I definitely learned something today!\n\nI would absolutely love to purchase some. Please update us in the future once they're available for sale.\n\nI, too would like to invest! :D (small batch)\n\nWhat zone are you in? I'm currently 6b, should be in 7b, by next year. I'd love to buy a few seeds, too if you have extra!\n\nLet us know when you start selling!\n\nZone 8b pnw. Would love to buy some seed from you too!\n\nI'm in northeast US and I would absolutely love to buy some and give it a shot!! They look like stained glass. I would cook with them but I would also make tons of different kinds of art with them. And send them to my mom in east TN :)\n\nEdit: forgot to add, she is an artist as well. &lt;3\n\nThis would be so cool to try out in my area! Keep us updated!\n\nWith all the work you put it, is there anyway to patent it?\n\nThere are ways to patent plants, but they’re expensive and typically only last 10 years or so before they need to be redone. Plant patents are something that larger businesses deal with. I know a hibiscus hybridized and he’s patented and sold a few of his hybrids. But he said it was too much work and he already has a full time job.\n\nI’d be interested.  I’m 9b\n\nVA 7a. Please let me know if you have some for me to buy as well!\n\n9B and I’d love to add this beauty to my garden\n\nI’d love to see if I could make it work in our greenhouse in alaska! We’ve grown some corn before but this would be so cool! I’ll keep an eye out!\n\nDef will send you a message if we can start selling this year. \n\nWould be interesting to see how it grows so far up north!\n\nPlease hybridize this with Choclo\n\nI have been trying this in the past! Because who would not like to have this massive kernels. \n\n\nBut for some reason i Cant get them to grow here in my local European climate.\n\nI would love to buy some to work here in N TX.\n\nLooks like it might make great liquor....\n\nWhat/how would you make a liquor out of it? Sounds like fun!\n\nWhat's your climate you currently are raising it in?\n\nMy parents in north middle TN have a pretty good sized garden, love to increase the diversity of its production and aren't strangers to saving seeds and preserving the lineage for the next year's crop especially regarding something unique like that.\n\nIf you send some to me, I will acclimate them to Northern Maine (likely also suitable for much of Canada)! And give you credit, and pay a reasonable $$. (Please)\n\nMain sure would be interning! they seem to handle the Dutch climate incredibly well. \n\nOne of the nice parts about living in the new world is that you guys have access to all the genetic diversity from this crop. Like I have to import every strain. and hope for the best\n\nZone 9 and also interested 🌽\n\nThe seed savers exchange has a lott of varieties available to members many of them Native American varieties with the history attached\n\n[Original post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/mildyinteresting/s/Ze1DFi8nqO) from a couple of months back. Did a quick head count today, we should end up with 320 cobs of corn!\n\nOOOH! Have you named it yet? Reminds me of Autumn 🍂  are you selling any seeds? I'd love to try this next year!\n\nI second this!\n\nWhat do you think of the name Nebula Casade?\n\nIf it needs a name I vote for pirate teeth\n\nLove it 🤣\n\nThey look like mini rainbow meringues!\n\nOr maybe \"Bomb Pop\" like those popsicles, depending on the vibe OP wants to go for\n\nCandy corn should look like this\n\nThis made me actually LOL\n\nCarnival corn!\n\nJelly Belly\n\nit looks like tie dyed corn! gorgeous\n\nTie Dye is a good name!\n\nHow can I purchase or trade for some of these seeds? Beautiful ear of corn!\n\nWell i will probably start selling seeds this year, Maybe next depending on the harvest and how happy im with it\n\nPlease let us know if you do! I would love to try to grow it in a greenhouse in the UK and see how it does in the long run 🌽\n\nLet me know if you’re selling seeds!\n\nI will\n\nMe too please!\n\nMe three!\n\nPlease add my name to the list, as well?  I'd love to grow this variety and make tortillas and cornbread with it!\n\nYou could name it Sunset Corn. Or Skittles. Id definitely buy some seeds if you sell after harvest.\n\nThat is the raddest corn I have ever seen! You developed this strain yourself?\n\nPsychedelic! You could call it \"skittles\", \"kaleidoscope\", or \"skittles kaleidoscope\".\n\nAbsolutely rad!\n\nkaleidocorn\n\nI'd say \"Psychedelic Kaleidoscope\" suits it quite well, don't you agree?\n\nConcur!\n\nThat's cool.  However, because you are talking about selling seeds this year or next in some of your comment replies, I have to say...\n\nIf what we see in this picture is your end goal, grown this year from seeds from all the different corn we see [in your post 6 months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/mildyinteresting/s/Ze1DFi8nqO), all you have right now is an unstable hybrid.  \n\nFrom here, you've still got at least 10 years of dedicated, isolated breeding and selecting to go until your corn stabilizes to what we see in your current picture.  \n\nIt takes a long time to stabilize a phenotype from a hybrid.\n\nLooks very beautiful but the saturation in the colors (leaves and hand) means they are more muted and not that much livid in real life.\n\nBeautiful!\n\nLooks like candy!\n\nSkittles\n\nSepia_Skittles\n\nThat looks really cool! What does it taste like? Like a sweet corn, or more savory?\n\nWhat were the parent strains?\n\nNow thats the interesting part! \n\nThere is this unknown red tiny Peruvian corn that started it all for me. \n\nBut also i have crossbred in: \n\n- Bloody Butcher \n- Navajo Robins Egg.\n- landrace from a hopi friend \n- Cherokee White Eagle Dent Corn\n- glass gem \n- Oaxacan Green Corn\n\nCould call it Navajo Jewel or something to that extent!\n\nWow! So cool! 🧡❤️💛💜\n\nOmg, that’s the most beautiful cone I’ve ever seen.\n\nThis is gorgeous! And I love that you want to make beautiful food with it but you can also make beautiful fall decorations with it too! I’d LOVE this on my front door, for instance!\n\nBeautiful! I really like the mix of colors!\n\nShove that Liberal corn where the sun don’t shine  /s\n\nI forgot I was subscribed to this post for potential seed drop info and this notification terrified me lol.\n\nWilly wonka should be the strain name!\n\nThey look like marbles! So pretty!\n\nSo cool!!\n\nHow to make my own strain?\n\nYears of selecting, crossbreeding, adapting and adding genetics \n\n\nIts really fun to do !\n\nThat's some serious cornology, friend.\n\nDamn!\n\nMad respect OP 🙌🙌\n\nWow!\n\nThat's beautiful ...\n\nSeeds??\n\nThis Fall! Keep an eye out\n\nWow, that's gorgeous!!\n\nWow! That is pretty!\n\nHow does it taste?\n\nYou don’t even have to take drugs to see this\n\nThat is beutiful\n\nWow, this is neat.\n\nThat's utterly glorious.\n\nso pretty!!\n\nthis is really cool! I would love to grow this!\n\nCongrats 👏\n\nits so pretty. . . good for you.\n\nbeautiful\n\nSell those to restaurants and get rich.\n\nThis is honestly the coolest thing I’ve ever seen. Congratulations OP your hard work and dedication over the years has definitely paid off.\n\nThank you so much! Its very nice to get some appreciation for this !\n\nWow! What beautiful corm!\n\nThat’s so awesome 👏 🤩\n\nlooks like jelly beans\n\nYou should dry some and make jewelry.  The colors are beautiful.\n\nThis corn is so pretty!\n\nLooks like little tie-dyed t-shirts\n\nI always thought Glass Gem corn looked really cool and wanted to grow it. This is way cooler! If my wife liked to eat corn I’d grow some!\n\nWhat does a Cobb like this taste like? 🤔\n\nFUN corn!!!\n\nSuch beautiful gems!\n\nThese are gorgeous, I tried growing corn to no avail, not even a single sprout. How do you make the masa for the tortilla with them?\n\nHell yeah. Beautiful!\n\nBeautiful\n\nBeautiful\n\nAwesome\n\nWhat’s the taste like?\n\nNice!\n\nThis makes me so happy! Thank you for sharing your corn\n\nBeautiful!!! How did it taste?\n\nCall it Skittles Corn\n\nSo stunning!!!\n\nThis is so beautiful\n\nBleed Red Rainbow\n\nWhoaaaaa\n\ncountry girls make do 💦\n\nThat is beautiful.\nHow does it taste?\n\nSo cool!!!\n\n Candy Corn! So beautiful!\n\nWow wow wow! How does it taste?\n\nIt's so pretty 🥹\n\nVery lovely\n\nIt looks like a $10k piece of glass art\n\nJellybean corn!\n\nNever thought of finding a cob of corn beautiful, and here I am staring at this in wonder\n\nI love seeing a human with a singular fascination that they pursue to mastery. That is all.\n\nWell Thank you so much! I would really like it if this would be my contribution to humanity, a Healthier, more complex colorful corn, with of course an amazing Taste\n\nIt would be a stunning contribution. That cob is beautiful. I honestly didn't think it was possible to achieve that color combination but it is very artistically pleasing.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jvq4jq89k8jd1.jpeg?width=1125&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=be6592562b0b5afb159b87e651f977f860e6a5f6\n\nThis looks like my tattoo. Corny unicorn corn.\n\nAI?\n\nMy 8-year-old: That's crazy. It's like discoball party corn!\n\nWicked! Are you going to sell seeds?\n\nIf and when you start selling seeds, send me a pm\n\nReally great looking, where are you growing this ?\n\nGosh, that's pretty! Very cool, OP!\n\nCorn Considered as an Array of Tie-dyed Kernels\n\nCount me in for seeds, please. I’ve saved this post.\n\nThe linkage drag be real on dis one.\n\nJaysus, you guys are getting these rainbow corns (congrats!), and I can't even get tomatoes. Did get some carrots this year, thankfully.\n\nWould love some seeds once you start selling\n\nHow does one make this strand of corn?\n\nWhat learning resources would you point the home gardener interested in small scale hobby breeding?\n\nabsolutely need this\n\nHow do you keep ants away? Ants eat up my corn\n\nI would absolutely buy several seeds when you choose to sell!\n\nThat corn looks gay\n\nCountry girls make do 🫦😫\n\nInterested! Would you trade seeds with me? I have a huge collection and would love to exchange!\n\nSomeone's gotta let corn kid know about this\n\nShow me your tortas 👁️👄👁️\n\nWow looks dope did u breed the colors?\n\nI think r/RainbowEverything would appreciate this beautiful corn…\n\nThis corn is so artistic, you just found gold in your garden\n\nWill you be selling seeds of this variety? Is it an F1?\n\nAs a Hoosier I deeply appreciate this picture.\n\nThat’s the most beautiful corn I’ve ever seen!\n\nNice one. Did you cross some recognizable varieties? Glass gem, bloody butcher?\n\nDid you hand pollinate then?  To get the cross?\n\nYes is did in the first f1 f2 gens, after that i let Nature donuts thing\n\nI haven’t seen these since I was a kid… My grandmother had some that she dried out, I somehow convinced my grandfather one day when it was just the two of us to try to make popcorn and I don’t remember what he did but it didn’t end well. She was not happy when she came home, I think it was just a burnt pan and maybe a few popped kernels but not popped like you’d eat. It was an experiment, we had fun. \n\nDo these taste good fresh? Why are they not something you see for sale?\n\nThis is the most beautiful corn I have ever seen, incredible job internet stranger!! What an amazing creation!\n\n😍\n\nWould love to see the original photo without the heavy filtering."

Sadly I haven’t taken a video of it and now he’s brumating (the reptile equivalent of hibernation) so he’s been asleep for days and days.\n\nNo worries! Hope he's having sweet dreams about them chopstick clicks.\n\nHi sorry to bother but has he woken up?\n\nHe wakes up occasionally but he hasn’t really eaten anything in a while!\n\nWhat kind of frog is that? My friend who lives in DE has the same one in their pond\n\nThis exchange was very cute 🥹\n\nDo you rent him out???\n\nMaybe he will sire a bunch of squash bug loving spawn in the spring and I can mail you some\n\nWhaaaat. A frog that doesn’t immediately jump in the water when I see him from 8 feet away!? I want a pet frog to feed bugs to.\n\nIf you feed them. They'll probably get used to you\n\nThere’s a pond near me where I see a little boy bringing a bucket of kitchen trimmings to the turtles. Now I can’t linger near shore too long or a flotilla launches in my direction.\n\nTo take care of my squash bug problem, I'd need roughly about...3 millions frogs.\n\nOr a wet/dry vac with 1\" of soapy water in the bottom.\n\nI think the frog army seems more manageable.\n\nAnd way more adorably fun.  I spose googly eyes on the vacuum could help.\n\nWhy have I never thought of this\n\nI was expecting this to be a video about using a vacuum before I watched it.  Pretending you're a ghostbuster is slightly less satisfying than feeding a frog.\n\nThey multiply pretty fast\n\nSo cute. I give my pond frogs worms and slugs. I think they notice when I'm out there and hang out near my \"offering\" spot.\n\nIt’s amazing how simple it is to create a welcoming environment. \n\nWe haven’t begun the water part of our big landscape project but look forward to it. \n\nWe have birds all over and it’s really pleasant to be outside\n\nI had frogs in my pond 2 days after I finishes it.\n\nOoh, any tips or resources you found helpful for your pond creation? I'm hoping to create a little \"natural habitat\" style pond specifically to attract frogs!\n\n\"If you build it, they will come.\" Just make sure you have plenty of boulders in and around your pond. They seem to hang out on rocks more than in the water. Plus foliage to hide in and under.\n\nHearing that boulders are the key is excellent news! My mom's place has a few inches of really nice topsoil and then it's basically all glacial debris in the form of big ol' rocks underneath, so in the process of gardening I've excavated a hell of a lot of rocks. Glad to know the frogs will like them. :)\n\nI used flatter ones to line my pond (and cover the liner). And I put a few big round ones in the pond.\n\nThat's it. It's pond time.\n\nI was expecting a chicken at the end but got a nice frog instead!\n\nSame!\n\nhomeless payment dazzling money ad hoc connect library work wide waiting\n\n *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev/home)*\n\nWell now I have my reason to install a little pond!\n\nHowever, I don't have the money to do it, but a girl can dream!\n\nI'm buying the pieces one at a time from yard sales and ebay. I'm about 50% of the way to a small fountain.\n\nI always try to catch spiders if one is in the house, and I let them go on the porch. A couple years ago, I had a spider in a glass covered with a card. I walked it outside and bent down to let it run free. Well, there happened to be a lizard hanging out at the edge of the porch. Lizard charged over and monched the spider like I had just delivered a pizza or something. Wild Kingdom.\n\nDid you know that praying mantises eat black widow spiders? Husband’s friend has a praying mantis for a pet and popped in an extremely large black widow. That praying mantis made mincemeat out of the black widow! I knew praying mantis’ were cannibalistic, but that display both gagged and astonished me. Now I see them as an Apex predator of the insect family!\n\n0_o\n\nThat is so cool!\n\nYou're just contributing to the circle of life! In a very satisfying kind of way lol.\n\nI thought it was going to be a chicken snack! Imagine my surprise!\n\nAs soon as I saw the chopsticks I wondered what it was going to be fed too, thought chickens at first then saw pond, thought fish, then see the calm, patient frog and laughed out loud. That is great!\n\nIt’s like your own personal Rancor pit, and you’re Jabba the Hutt.\n\nRancor are surprisingly gentle and bond with the first person they see.  They get a bad rap. :D\n\nTwo heroes in one video. Wow.\n\nForbidden sushi\n\nVery satisfying.  I want a pond, but I'm afraid we'll have more mosquitoes than we can handle\n\nI was worried about the same thing - but we haven’t had any mosquito larva at all! I have a very cheap bubbler that keeps the water moving a bit, which the mosquitos don’t like. The frogs and dragonflies help too.\n\nPut fish in it, they eat the larvae. Win, win!\n\nThe next heron that visits your property will really appreciate the set up you have there for the fish and frogs.\n\nI used to work for a couple that had a little pond like that and they had to add fish like every year because a heron would stop by and clean them out.\n\nExactly why I chose to not have fish! Herons certainly are pond destroyers.\n\nWow, this is amazing!! Would you mind sharing a bit more about how your pond is set up? I would love to put a little pond in our yard to attract more frogs and critters.\n\nSure! I am not a pond expert and kind of just hacked it together, but we love it!\n\nI bought a preformed pond, 6’ diameter and 18” deep I think. I sunk it into the ground enough so the top would be the same height as my raised beds, then just put bricks around it.. I still need to finish that part 😅\n\nI have a small cheap bubbler inside. Then I just added plants! A few frogs my kids caught as tadpoles, and some came on their own. \n\nIt’s been very little upkeep and I haven’t had any issues with mosquitoes, but maybe I’ve just been lucky.\n\nWe really love ours, I’m sure you will too!!\n\nOK wow, this is so inspiring! (And the bricks look really good from what I can see!) \n\nMy daughter loves frogs and tadpoles (Agway is \"the tadpole store\" after we found a bunch of tadpoles in their tank with the lilypads this spring) so I know a little pond would be so fun for her. And nice to hear the mosquitoes aren't bad, either! Thank you for sharing :)\n\nI feed my pond fish caterpillars and slugs. They love them. Pond skimmers love bugs too\n\nExcellent 🖖\n\nI’ve never seen a frog eat from chopsticks, until today.\n\nBummer was hoping for a shark\n\nImagine a giant approaches you and offers you a warm bowl of spaghetti\n\nThis reminds me of *Mercy* by Rudy Francisco. \n\n*She asks me to kill the spider.\nInstead, I get the most\npeaceful weapons I can find.*\n\n*I take a cup and a napkin.\nI catch the spider, put it outside\nand allow it to walk away.*\n\n*If I am ever caught in the wrong place\nat the wrong time, just being alive\nand not bothering anyone,*\n\n*I hope I am greeted\nwith the same kind\nof mercy.*\n\nExcept the bug is definitely bothering someone and the frog is the object of the poem, just chilling, not able to understand why he's being fed.\n\nWell, maybe it is easy being green.\n\nI'll show myself out...\n\nMe the whole walk to the pond: please\nFeed it to something please feed it to something\n\nI was hoping for a possum but was equally pleased to see a frog\n\nThat’s so cool!\n\nCircle of life, with chopsticks.\n\nWe don't have frogs, but I often feed our pests to any local lizards or spiders lol. Feels like a waste just killing the bugs.\n\nI wish I lived in a climate with local lizards, that is so cool!!\n\nThe funniest is watching them eat a fat grub lol\n\nI love it!  And I love your frog!\n\nr/humansbeingbros\n\nMay I ask some pond questions? Did you build your pond and the frog came or did you stock it with frogs? I have been toying with creating a little pond in my backyard, but I have a lot of birds who frequent my birdbath, so think would it be useless to create a pond, because fish, frogs or lizards will just get eaten? I also have cats in my neighborhood. My backyard is the only one without a dog near me, so I get visited a lot. Once a pond is established are they a lot of upkeep? I really like the fountain sound and think, maybe just get a small fountain type set-up instead of going full pond with lily pads, and critters?\n\nHi! I’m definitely not a pond expert, ours is very DIY. \n\nMy kids caught maybe five of the frogs as tadpoles and the other ones came on their own! Our pond is in the center of our garden and we also have lots of birds, but not really any frog eating ones (yet). \n\nI have done zero upkeep other than keeping a small bubbler on to deter mosquitoes. I think the frogs, plants, and snails (which must have snuck in on a plant) keep it kind of in balance. \n\nI can’t speak to fish or cats 🤷‍♀️\n\nGood luck on your future water feature! I’m sure you will love whatever you decide on!\n\nThank you for your thoughtful response! I’ve heard when adding goldfish to ponds they increase in size depending on the pond size. It seems like if you build it…they will come?! lol. When I was growing up my grandparents had two large ponds and I spent my entire visit running around the perimeter trying to catch those dang frogs (too fast for me! Never caught any). I think my husband and I would really have a fun time watching and filling a little pond. I got a cheap little birdbath and can’t believe the birds I have seen using it! I don’t feed the birds, but I do keep it filled with just enough water where it attracts them.\n\nThat’s awesome\n\nVery satisfying!\n\nOh my gosh this is amazing! We got inundated with squash bugs on our two beautiful pumpkin plants (population is waning now), and I so wish we had frogs. That's awesome.\n\nIs THAT the reason my squash and cucumbers look like SHIT?\n\nFeed the squash bug to the child\n\nActually lolled over here\n\nfwaahhhh!  the meal service here is fantastic!  you don't even have to lift your own chopsticks!\n\nThat frog looks like a pickle\n\nLove it !! I fed quite a few to the orbweavers this year. Love watching them get spun up. lol. Keep up the good fight.\n\nOh I will have to try that!\n\nDid you know the costco hot dog combo has been $1.50 for 40 years? \n\nPost this In r/humansbeingbros\n\nDid plant survive?\n\nLove it! Those damn squash bugs are the reason I won't try growing zucchini or any other squash or cucumbers at the community garden ever again.\n\nI am so upset I don’t do this with the toad I found in my yard yesterday\n\nHell yeah\n\nTasty\n\nWarms my heart to see such a thing.\n\nMy garden is FULL of leopard frogs, I should try feeding them next year. :)\n\nAt first I thought he was weevil and was upset, but then I saw the squash bug comment and immediately agreed with this execution method.\n\nIf we have the fire pit on that day, I throw them in\n\nI love thisss. Feeding them to chickens is also very satisfying!!\n\nUnleash the Kraken!\n\nWow, how many bugs do you have??? You just keep going back for more! Will you ever get them all? Will the frog ever get full?? He just keeps eating them!\n\nMaybe it IS easy being green.\n\nUmm. Why have I never thought to grab bugs with chopsticks? It's the PERFECT solution. \n\nThe frog is cute too lol.\n\nI think more satisfying would be if the frog went through your yard eating all those squash bugs on their own...then coming to my yard to mop up the stragglers\n\nWhen fate deals its mortal blow\n\nHell yeah! That was satisfying for me too!\n\nplay this in slow-mo\n\nlol my little brother did this yep back in the old country yep pop em in the sticks (USED STICKS FROM YARD NOT CHOP STICKS) pop em in his mouth yep.hes dead now but i have his last clip of destiny 2 gameplay to remember him by.\n\nBring them to my chickens….🐓 may they feast and share the limbs of thy enemies. \n\n\nI need to go to bed\n\nFeeding bugs to chickens can be pretty good sport too.\n\nI remember a few times when a robin would hang out fairly close to me when I was edging as a landscaper, waiting for me to move on so it could search for any crawlies left behind. I’d toss it a worm now and again. 🪱\n\nThe frog is getting spoiled and losing his own hunting skill, just like my little boy lol\n\nImpressive high functioning eco system there!\n\nThat bug is already dried and dead.\n\nedit: oh wait it's not a larva, but a live adult. Nice catch.\n\nThank you OP,  watching your vid made me happy 😁\n\nI didn’t even realize a frog was there I thought hes giving it to a fish🤣\n\nNature\n\nI do the same thing! I grab some caterpillars off the roses and japanese beetles off of everything and give the frogs a feast! lol\n\nSo what you're saying is I need to ask my husband to put in a pond. 😂😂\n\nOP I need more information on that pond! I want one!\n\nThey're not terribly hard to make. We made a 2 tier planter with a pond in the top level. Just used Cindercrete Easy Stack bricks, and got a rigid pond liner. Ours is seasonal (emptied and covered in winter) so just used for aquatic plants, no fish or frogs, unfortunately.\n\nOh my gosh I never would’ve thought to use chopsticks to pick them up. That’s ingenious\n\nThe way nature intended\n\nThat frog is such a good boi helping with the garden\n\nThats fucking great!  I give mine to the Venus fly trap. Definitely not as cool but I do get to see them struggle for a bit!\n\na real quick frog eating style...\n\n*FISH*\n\nOr close enough\n\nOrganic recycling\n\nI was hoping for fire and was sad to see water but then I saw frog. Well done!\n\n(kill them all)"

When you see Sweet Moon Farm follow you, that’s me ☺️\n\nare you selling this year?\n\nYes. PM me for link.\n\nThe best season! Yours are lovely.\n\nOooh I love this mix! Do you know the varieties?\n\nI grow 200 + varieties and this bunch has like 20 in it. Do you have an exact one you are looking for? I see bloomquist blush, Ruthie g,  sweet Nathalie, valley porcupine, and blizzard.\n\nGotcha! The one at about 10 o’clock in your photo, top left, pink with a touch of purple on the tip of a few of the petals. If you know that’s wonderful! If not all good. 😊\n\nIs [this](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C-31h7HttGW) the one you are talking about? That one is Hollyhill Monet. A bit hard to find tho.\n\nYes that’s it! Good to know and thank you.\n\nI was actually at a funeral service the other night where they had beautiful white dahlias. It was an infant’s funeral unfortunately but the white symbolizes purity, like it doesn’t have any pain in heaven now\n\nOh my that’s beautiful!\n\nBeautiful!\n\nGood lord they are gorgeous\n\nWow absolutely stunning\n\nevery year mine are my go to summer cut flower and this year they didn't do good at all. Few just didn't grow at all and the ones that did flowered and but not that amazing big vibrant ones.... yours look great\n\nGorgeous 🥹\n\nTruly impressive, wish they could survive the winters here in Zone 6!\n\nI am in zone 6, and dig them up every year. I pretty much just hate life for 2 weeks every fall .\n\nI certainly would be open to digging up a modest amount in the future. I’m a first time homeowner that just started putting a garden in this summer, so I’m not quite ready for that level of dedication haha. But major props to you!\n\nI grow them in zone 6. It is kind of a hassle to dig up the tubers every fall, but I think it's worth it. Plus, it means I always have extra to give to friends!\n\nI love the digging/storing process!  I usually make a fire, drink some fall beers, and think of it as my last hurrah in the garden!  I only have about 30 plants though, so it's not so bad.\n\nI like it! That’s a cool way to mark the passing of seasons\n\nAbsolutely gorgeous\n\nWhat's it like in new york city?\n\nBeautiful!  What’s your favorite variety (pictured or not) if you had to choose just one?\n\nI cant choose one. Its like picking my favorite child. :)\n\nBeautiful perfect arrangement😍\n\nAmazing and pretty colors wow! 🤩\n\nThey are beautiful! 🥰\n\nUr selection is amazing!! Do they ever crossbreed or smt? that would be fun\n\ni think they do, that’s what many serious dahlia farmers end up doing is breeding their own exclusive dahlias and selling the tubers after a couple years of trials\n\nGorgeous 😍😍\nLove the colors and the arrangement!\n\nBeautiful! What’s the variety for the white one and the pink one to the right?\n\nBeautiful!\n\nGlorious! Mine were doing so well early this year then the Midwest heat wave in May/June happened and haven’t recovered ☹️\n\nThose are absolutely stunning!!! 💕💕💕\n\nObsessed!\n\nThese are beautiful😍\n\nBeautiful\n\nMy jaw dropped\n\nSO beautiful, congrats!!! They’re gorgeous!\n\nSo pretty!!! 😍\n\nOMG! Sooo gorgeous\n\nPretty. I bought some dinnerplate dahlia tubers in the Spring. They keep getting taller, but no flowers.\n\nBeautiful,  it looks like a painting\n\nMy fav!! so beautiful\n\nWow..\n\nOh I love dahlias! One of my favorite flowers. So many varieties.\n\nPerfect 😍\n\nStunning 🩷\n\nVery pretty\n\nMy sister planted an entire bed with just dahlias, and I’m jealous. They are so pretty.\n\nWow!\n\nThis. Is. Perfection.\n\nUnbelievably gorgeous. Well done.\n\nThat’s dahlia porn\n\nSO pretty!\n\nGod, those are so fucking beautiful\n\nMay I ask where you live and what climate you have to grow them?\n\nMichigan, zone 6\n\nThank you, they are stunning. All my plants tend to die in TX heat. 😭\n\nI know people that grow them in the off seasons? But yeah, it's definitely hard!\n\nAMAZING\n\nWow\n\nGorgeous!\n\nYesss! Beautiful photo 🩷\n\nYaaaay!!!!\n\nI'm a dahlia junkie and I live about 1.5 hours from Swan Island Dahlia Farms! It's beautiful this time of year!\n\nBeautiful!!!\n\nBeautiful\n\nYou must be in the PNW?\n\nMichigan\n\nNorth like me. Mine also just comin in\n\nTruly beautiful, the flowers and the shot. I'd love to paint them, or at least try to.\n\nBeautiful 💖💖💖\n\nSo pretty 😍\n\n😱 gorgeous\n\n🩷\n\nOh my god stunning\n\nAbsolutely gorgeous.\n\nBeautiful 😍\n\nWell done 👏🏼 dahlias are not easy!!\n\nSo so stunning!! You have a gorgeous collection 🌸🌸🌸\n\nLove! 💕\n\nThese are stunning 💕\n\nBeautiful\n\n[removed]\n\nGrow your own! They are not hard, especially if you treat them like annuals.\n\nSoooo beautiful and my favorite flowers.\n\n Those are my favorite!\n\nWow! They are beautiful! 😻\n\nThese are stunning!\n\nSo happy for you!! So envious.🥹 Why don’t they like Oklahoma, we’re so friendly!😂\n\nSo wonderful! I wish our garden have some!\n\nCrazy pretty!\n\n☹️☹️thank you for sharing, this is the prettiest bouquet I’ve ever seen ❤️❤️\n\nBeautiful 🌸\n\nholy smokes those are gorgeous\n\nIncredible!  Thanks for sharing\n\nI love dahlias. They grow so early here, and then they don't seem to even last into June 1st (zone 9B). I wish I could have more blooming plants. But the heat seems to torture them.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1b733i2obikd1.jpeg?width=4000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6d9c2a7e74f16159a2ec510eacfce2d2cc3d54dc\n\nAll my favorite colors! \n\nVery, very beautiful!!\n\nGorgeous bunch you have there. \nI love flowers, in general, but dahlias are so spectacular - they take my breath away. I could look at dahlias every minute of every day.\n\nGorgeous!!\n\nMmmmhmmmm. I love this\n\nVirtual walkthrough? 🙏🏼😍\n\nMy old dad would have loved this\n\nI just followed you and 😍😍😍\n\n[removed]\n\nNot really, dahlias don't really like consistently moist soil, easier for tuber rot to set in. I try to water deeply once a week and that's about it.\n\nWhats you do to me ohhhhh\n\nMusic hey there dahlia\n\nMy sister is growing dahlias for the first time this year, and I thought this was her for a second! Stunning! So many colours, so many interesting combinations, and just stunningly beautiful petals. Congratulations! Good luck with sales!\n\nMy sister is growing dahlias for the first time this year, and I thought this was her for a second! Stunning!

Upon further inspection and going through my stash, these here are what look close enough to it.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rmt7iedvohrd1.jpeg?width=2252&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce48c16c1879604ba1a57900dbe56a04565d7e4e\n\nThank you for digging up your tomato catalog, you're very helpful and I appreciate you!\n\nYou are very welcome. 🥰 Thank you for the compliment. I appreciate it and you, too. 🙏🏻\n\nWawawewa\n\nSo from the photo is it \"marglobe\"?\n\nThat one or the Rio Grande.\n\nGoliath?\n\n This is the 'Stellar' variety.\n\nDang, how do we buy seeds from this exact tomato plant?\n\nI always save seeds from my fruits, hope OP is doing the same\n\nThis might be dumb, but… how do you save tomato seeds? Do you have to wash them off and dry them before storing?\n\nYeah! I’ll throw them in a mesh sieve, gently massage as much goo off under running water, pat dry with a paper towel in the sieve and then spread on to a plate or plastic to go box lid and let dry for a couple days before scraping off and putting in a plastic bag \n\nYou don’t need to wash, but they will stick to the the drying surface more; I have not washed seeds and still grown tomatoes from them\n\n[deleted]\n\nI was taught to ferment them to remove the gel. Put in a small glass with juices, cover and set out for a few days as it gets bubbly and nasty, then rinse and dry.\n\nThis is best practice.\n\nI do the same. I have a tea filter whose screen will hold the seeds that I use to wash the seeds of their \"scum\". I dry my seeds on a paper towel. They will become glued to the towel if dried completely so I try to catch the paper towel when it is still slightly damp as I can scrap up the seeds before they are glued. The post suggesting wax paper sounds smart.\n\nFirst, be careful about cross pollination. You want at least 75-100' between species for tomatoes. \n\nThen let the fruit get ripe to the point of dropping. \n\nI scoop all the gel sacs out of several good fruit. I like a wide mouth mason jar. And let it ferment (just sit there and shake it twice a day) for 3-4 days. \n\nThe good seed will sink to the bottom. Pour off the top, fill with clean water, shake, repeat until just seed is left. \n\nThen I drain and dry on a sheet tray until I can put it in envelopes. \n\nYOU ABSOLUTELY CAN save seed without being so rigorous, but you aren't guaranteed the same species or quality.\n\nEdit: source https://www.thriftbooks.com/w/the-organic-seed-grower-a-farmers-guide-to-vegetable-seed-production/9268940/#isbn=1933392770\n\nInteresting— thank you!!\n\nThis turned into an obsession this year and why I have 4 small gardens at 4 corners of the property. Lol.\n\nDo you have any tips for successfully growing tomatoes? Every time I talk to people about it they either say it’s the easiest thing they’ve ever done or tell me not to waste my time because it’s absolutely miserable, nothing in between!\n\nGood soil with clean compost (no diseased plant material) and calcium is the best place to start. I always mulch around my tomatoes because soil splashing up on the foliage can spread fungal issues and mulch helps retain moisture. Water the soil not the leaves and water deeply. Use clean garden scissors to prune, I spray mine with rubbing alcohol and wipe them off. Cut off leaves that have spots or that look infected. Add a balanced organic fertilizer around your plants. Watch videos on how to properly prune tomatoes. I'm never consistent with pruning but it's good to do occasionally.\n\nI also never plant tomatoes in the same spot two years in a row. This year they're in the North bed, next year they go in the South bed next to the garlic. Just seems to prevent a lot of issues that way. \n\nYou'll learn the tricks as you grow them and improve your garden.\n\nI’m pretty casual about seed saving. I cut up a ‘best tomato’ from plants on a paper towel. Taking 10-15 seeds onto a small-ish space. Let the paper towel and seeds dry out by laying by a window sill and forgetting it for a week. Then put it away til next year. When it’s time to start seeds, put the whole piece in a seed starting tray or lid with a litte dirt covering it. Then you separate your seeds after a month of good sprouting.\n\nMaybe controversial but I normally just pick the fruit and if there is one that’s been munched or has blossom rot, I chuck it on top of a pot with soil in and inevitably, next growing season it will appear (if it doesn’t get eaten beforehand)\n\nThe easiest method is to put the seeds in a glass of water.  Wait a week, it will be scummy.  Pour the scum into a wire strainer and rinse.  All the gel will be gone. Then dry and store in someplace low light/low humidity.\n\n[deleted]\n\nThat’s the fun part\n\nSun dry 'em, boil 'em, stick 'em in a stew!\n\nWe likes them RAW!\n\n...With salt.\n\nI have four tomatoes left that my husband picked before he cleared out the garden. We are definitely having the final meal of BLT sandwiches this week.\n\nToast, mayo, tomato, salt \n\n🥖 🥚 🍅 🧂\n\nplus lemon juice 🤌🏽🤌🏽🤌🏽\n\nThis is the way.\n\n*Denethor, the Steward of Gondor has entered the chat*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5ipxwaqgrlrd1.jpeg?width=1125&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=07a1646bad8e9f6d77a83b4b2ddd3252e011e1db\n\nPreserve them\n\n'em\\*\n\nSmash ‘em\n\nWhat is…..tomaters, precious?\n\nYou know, TO-MAY-TOES??\n\nTo may to, to may to.\n\nIt should be illegal to post something like this without the variety 😂\n\nLooks like my Fourth of July hybrid.\n\nI can’t even give them away anymore\n\nAre they tasty?\n\nYou bet!\n\nFood banks take them.\n\nI never considered this and it is a fantastic idea. I always grow too much of a few veggies throughout the year.\n\nI was thinking the same! My fourth of July is like a jungle- it needs twice the space of a regular heirloom and 2-3x the harvesting.\n\nI knew I was in trouble when it started growing over my neighbors fence in late July. Growing season goes to November where I'm at.\n\nThey're a great one person serving size with breakfast though.\n\nI think the weather adds to the tomato crop. Some years the yield is great, some years not so much.  I grow nothing but San Marzano, better boy and beef steak varieties. We have been eating fresh tomatoes since July.\n\nYup we had a hot and rainy summer here.  Best yikes I’ve ever had\n\nI wasn't able to grow any this year but the last couple before this were terrible for me :( I went from begging people to take tomatoes, to having almost none and needing to buy boxes from others for the soup I like to cook and freeze for winter.\n\nI must admit I do use miracle grow. I tried organic gardening for a number of years and the yield was awful. We all must do work works best for us. 🙂\n\nMiracle-Gro has an excellent new line of organic soils &amp; plant food. Try them next year!\n\nI used Miracle grow organic to fill a raised bed this year and I wasn't a huge fan of it. SO many weeds in it that my other beds filled with local potting soil or pots with regular miracle gro didn't get.\n\nBeen a weird tomato year, for sure!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3u23fgtr3hrd1.jpeg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=33363e8b85a2a84bdc774c40019762cc848c85ca\n\nThey’re beautiful!\n\nWhat a fun harvest!\n\nI have gotten exactly 1 tomato this year. Would be really awesome if temps could drop below 90... Its September 27 and the daytime high was 103F today....\n\nYikes. We went from muggy, hot, humid and miserable to low 60’s and rain. No happy medium. Better than a hurricane though.\n\nAside from about 2 total weeks (not consecutive days), it has been 95+ since late March. The one tomato I got was already on the plant when I bought it from the nursery. The plant is 6+ feet tall now lol\n\nUgh, I live in the big bend.\n\nSame here. I've grown tomatoes for 15 years and I'm thinking about giving up next year and just sticking with peppers.\n\nWe’ve had the opposite problem. Only 1 day above 30 Celsius, I’ve got lots of green tomatoes still on the vine but the weather has already turned for autumn.\n\nYes same I started with over 10 plants of different large varieties, the only thing that grew were cherry and grape varieties and the midnight snack. I have like 3 Roma that are ripening now. It’s been a rough season.\n\nI had a horrible tomato year too! I tried San Marzanos. I was horribly disappointed by how horribly they produced, wasn't crazy about the taste, and then they went and got blight. I did some one offs too to try some other varieties but nothing really produced behind one here and there. Back to Roma town for me next year.\n\nYes, all of my tomatoes have tough skins from the above 95 degree temps here.\n\nUmmmm HOW?!\n\nFreeze them whole on a cookie sheet. When fully frozen, store them in large ziploc bags in the freezer.  They will be good for cooking in soups, stews and sauces when thawed out. It’s easier than typical canning methods and does pretty well at preserving the garden tomato flavor.\n\nI do this with cherry tomatoes. Works great.\n\nHmm, didn't know you could preserve them this way. Any downsides?\n\nEdit: fixed a typo\n\nI can’t think of any.  When I’m ready to add them to what I’m cooking I take them out of the freezer and blanch them in boiling water. This will make the skins slide off easily.  I then chop up the still mostly frozen tomatoes and toss them into the pot to let them cook down. They actually sort of crumble and don’t always chop into cubes very well.  Which is why they are good for soups, stews or sauces.\n\nThanks, I think I'm going to give this a try\n\nI do this too, and the only downside is it takes more space in the freezer and then more prep time when you pull them out.  But as Missue-35 states below, the skins slide off so easily and they are easy to break apart/crumble for stews.  I've been freezing them whole for several years, but I do freeze some after making sauce or crushed tomatoes to help move the prep process along on the other side.  But if you are overwhelmed with tomatoes and not time to process them, pop them in the freezer whole!\n\nI am sp psyched to read this. My work (day health center for adults) receives sometimes 30 lbs of gleaned tomatoes a week, this will be so helpful!\n\nAfter freezing them whole, you can just run a frozen tomato under a tap of warm water, and the skins just slide off. I use these frozen tomatoes for sauce, soups, wherever you can use canned tomatoes.\n\nWater your tomatoes early in the morning. Depending on where you live. If you are in the desert area, then you would water them early in the morning and late evening.\n\nEven in the desert we still only water early morning. Like just before dawn. \n\nNever at night. \n\nI agree, never at night. You'll be prone to root rot if you do.\n\nLate evening counts as night here lol. You will be prone to slugs and snails and disease if you water that late in the day. We start our irrigation at 5am and the last line is done at 10am. If we have to do a second water it is always finished by 4pm so things have time to dry out before sundown. \n\nOnce mine fruit I pretty much stop watering them altogether, unless I don't get rain for like a week, or if it's consistently over 35°-ish.  Makes the flavour more concentrated.\n\nAre you complaining or bragging?\n\nYes\n\nOmg…that’s crazy!   What type of tomatoes?   You must be doing something right!\n\nI’m counting 47 ripe tomatoes that I can see in the picture. You win.\n\nMy romas basically did this. I’m on my 3rd harvest in 4b with them. At one point I counted 24 tomatoes on one plant. I’ve barely been able to keep up with canning.\n\nDo you want to just punch me in the neck too?\n\nDon’t worry. We all have our Achilles heel. I’ve got 8 bell pepper plants. Several different varieties. And I got 3 pepper total. 2 of those barely being baseball sized. This is the 3rd year I’ve tried and I’m officially giving up after this.\n\nI am of the opinion that garden growers will never get the big softball size bell peppers we see int he store and those sizes are reserved for commercial growers in a controlled environment. :) I've grown them for a few years and I never get much bigger than a baseball.\n\nGo with the smaller bell varieties. Very prolific.\n\nI’ve tried so many varieties. They just don’t seem to love my garden. I’ve tried different places in my yard, starting them at different times, just buying starts from a local reputed nursery and they just never really develop.\n\nYou can freeze them too until your ready to can\n\nDangggg how the heck!? That was one good plant!! I want seeds 🍅🥹\n\nIt is literally a crime that you made this post and didn’t tell us variety. \n\nOP come back and give us the deets! (Or the seeds- we will take seeds!) \n\nI’ve had some white zinger cherry tomatoes that did this! I had gotten 1lb earlier this summer and the last week I got another 1lb\n\nI eat them like apples. I adore tomatoes\n\nWell good job on growing and making me jealous all at the same time lol\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6f5uh0cuwird1.jpeg?width=527&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fd828476d14ce0df96bc0650e923bf8aed3bb138\n\nOne year I was harvesting a lot of cherry tomatoes through the end of November. My garden had been tilled except for where the tomatoes were located. They just kept producing. .\n\nHoly mackerel! What’s your secret? And what variety is this? Also, how do they taste?\n\nSecond\n\nI have one doing the same thing, crazy!! I lost the name tag but I remember the word “early” was in the name.\n\nEarly girl?\n\nYes, I think that was it. The most prolific Tomatoe plant I have ever planted.\n\nthat's awesome.  all mine got blossom end rot\n\nNeed calcium in the soil\n\nYeah… I had a bumper crop previously that I think depleted all the nutrients\n\nSave some seeds ❤️\n\nDang tomatoes you want a little vine and leaves with yourself??? Wish I had this problem with literally everything I grow\n\nAll of mine were eaten by tree rats and then the plants died in a heat wave… can I have some of your tomatoes?\n\n😂😂😂 are “tree rats”squirrels? Sorry about your tomatoes :(\n\n“Hercules! Hercules Hercules!” 👏\n\nTo paraphrase Hotei, give me one tomato.\n\nLet it reseed for next year.\n\nThe secret please!\n\nI want your seed!\n\nThanks, yall! I finally found the tag for this plant, had to dig in the dirt a little bit. This variety is named \"Stellar.\" Yes this plant is dying, as it is autumn. With these tomatoes included, I harvested around 80-90 from this plant for the season. My garden is inside a corral and every october it is used to herd cattle into a trailer. The cattle eat whatever remains, till up the ground with their hooves, and poop for one-two days. Then, in the spring, I till their poop into the soil. I only had to water the garden once this year, as we had good rains once a week or so. I still have to harvest potatoes, carrots, celery, onions, peppers, eggplant, and Marijuana. Raccoons decimated the corn, so I did lose some to pests. A black bear did get quite a few of my apples as well.\n\nForever pasta sauce cheat - is the variety name I bet\n\nWe love to see it\n\nHow???????? What sort of sorcery is this???????\n\nNot only is this insanely productive, do you not have any pest problems?! \n\nNo squirrels? like, at all?\n\nRaccoons took all my corn. Nothing seems to get the tomatoes except blight, but it's always too late to kill the plants. It probably just stimulates them to make more fruit.\n\nSo jealous. \n\nI’m in a heated tomato battle with the local peckerheads, aka ground squirrels. \n\n(They’ve also taken out most of my pepper plants too. Ugh)\n\nWild.\n\nOk, ok, we are all very impressed...\n\nSave some seeds for next year!\n\nMy currently medicated heart burn is screaming at me looking at this picture.\n\nMy sister had her first garden this year. She planted 64 tomato plants. She is now having this issue, times 64! lol\n\nI love tomatoes and so I got a pack of seeds and planted them, they all died except one, which is growing to be much like this plant and I just know once they’re ripe I’m gonna be so overwhelmed. Gonna have tomato soup and spaghetti for days\n\nI’m super jealous. Your going to have some delicious dishes\n\nI got two and three more later.  I want your plant!\n\nIs that Champion?\n\nSeconding this guess\n\nCan I buy seeds?\n\nTime to start canning\n\nI have some deer and one resident groundhog that you can borrow. No charge.\n\nI'm a big fan of the yellow pear-shaped tiny tomatoes.  this looks very good !\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qrhmkcdx8hrd1.jpeg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e29ee9c6bb69d2dc0a7977a76567b913abb7a38f\n\nAre those Sun Gold by any chance?\n\nI'm 90% sure yes.\n\nI love them, so sweet!💛\n\nI grew sungold for the first time this year and OMG!! They’re now my favorite cherry tomato! Can’t stop eating them. I love the super sweet 100 also.\n\nWhat am I doing wrong!??!\n\nWhat nutrients or supplements do you add to the plant?\n\nMaybe you should take a few cuttings to root and overwinter\n\nSquirrels stole almost all of mine, even the ones I put fruit bags around. I’m so jealous\n\n Mine look like that too. Mine are Early Girls, they grow in good compost and get a ton of sun, little water. Though I have to say I don’t prune mine as heavily as yours and I could get more harvest if I did (so the sun can reach them). You’re doing it right. Beautiful thanks for posting. Ps I’m in pnw.\n\nDefinitely a determinant variety\n\nI had the same this w a chilli last year, like it was offended I stole all his seed pods - HEY I WAS WORKIN ON THOSE!!! 😡😅\n\nI would snap these up so quick.\n\nReplant with those same seeds. Selective breeding at its finest\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6wnu42aacjrd1.jpeg?width=2766&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=650ea5cea274203b148d191ac0391ac75ed36ee0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/grc71nvq8lrd1.jpeg?width=226&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ee0d5b924cb233ce9f160bfaf5cdfcca4270b47b\n\nCelebrate the abundance!\n\nNeed to cross post to r/sandwiches\n\nCrazy good production on that plant. Great job!!!\n\nOhhhhh...I'm positively drooling! There's nothing better than a homegrown, vine ripened tomato!\n\nGrind them up skins and all in a food processor and cook them down for sauce. Put a dinners worth in freezer bags and freeze. Sauce all winter\n\nWinner winner tomato dinner!\n\nWhat variety is this?\n\nWhat a good looking harvest! I just cut my cherry tomato plant down this week. It was still flowering and producing hundreds of tomatoes! I already took a huge harvest to make tomato jam and I was tired of maintaining it. Plus the hornworms were having a field day eating away at the plant so I said it’s time to go 😂\n\nYou are making some sauce!\n\nThicc\n\nBlessed\n\nThis year I cultivated tomatoes in my vegetable garden, never again. From now on I will grow this plant as an ornamental one, as in the beginning\n\nWhy should some have so much when others (me) have so little 😞\n\nIt's salsa time!  Next time try to get some when they're green. They make excellent relish/ picalilly .\n\nCan I get some seeds?\n\nDamn, what nutes you use? I grow toms every year.\n\nWhat the fuck are you feeding this thing? Human sacrifice? Because if that’s what it takes…\n\nGoats. Many many goats.\n\nEnd of the season.  Rest of you don't know what you're looking at?  The leaves are gone, only tomatos remain lol\n\nYup, I got about 100 tomatoes from this one, not a bad year.\n\nWhat variety is this???\n\nCount your blessing my friend, I've seen people only get one small tomato from a whole tree. Enjoy sauce making!\n\nI love overly enthusiastic plants so much\n\nHave to love the indeterminate tomatoes.\n\nI use ocean Forrest soil . It is sooo good I dress with earthworm castings and alternate with covichoir\n\nTomatoes really do like doing whatever they want. I had a plant I barely watered, and it was in full texas sun in the summer. It lived for months and produced fruit anyway, and it was good. Tomatoes are just weeds if you do nothing about them.\n\nSo this is where my tomatoes went! I got all leaves and flowers for 4 months but 0 tomatoes 😅\n\nMoneymaker?\n\nMy mouth is watering\n\nI would say this tomato plant is absolutely pumping\n\nWow\n\nShe had more to say… 🍅\n\nWow that looks great\n\nWish I could do this.\n\nHow are you doing it!??? My tomato plants always die young 😭😭😭\n\nSalsa for days. Grilled cheese samiches! Grilled cheese with tomato freaken soup!!!! 🤫🤭🤤🫣"

I get that part of it is wedding appropriate but are people just ignoring the beast part?\n\nI once played Bon Iver’s “Skinny Love” for the bride’s entrance. People are weird.\n\nthat’s what the time limit is — break the curse before the rose is killed by bugs\n\nThat's right, good reference!\n\nI was thinking of Miss Haversham from Great Expectations, but that fits too!\n\nMe too! Glad I'm not the only one\n\nMy brain went to Faulkner's [\"A Rose For Emily\"](https://anthology.lib.virginia.edu/work/Faulkner/faulkner-rose-emily)\n\nThis would have ate in tumblr\n\nHahaha yes!!\n\nGood news, tumblr is still alive and kicking!\n\nWouldn’t say “kicking” so much as meekly shivering in a corner while the big baddies of social media fight each other for dominance.\n\nAhaha, meek is maybe the last word I’d use to describe tumblr culture.\n\n[deleted]\n\nThey nixed the porn and tons of people migrated to Twitter. Tumblr is a chiller place for sure\n\nThe whole tumblr in action thing really fell off. Used to be you couldn’t go a day on Reddit without seeing a post from that sub, now nothing\n\nAt this point, you could say that about every social media platform.\n\n\"Luigi wins by doing nothing\" is a widespread meme on there for a reason.\n\nnaw dude. you can say anything there. try that anywhere else\n\nShhhhh no it’s not\n\nSpider mites . This is bad\n\nBad for plant. Great for photo.\n\nBad for my PTSD\n\nBut so good\n\nYikes. Is that what's on my umbrella papyrus?\n\nGoing to need a picture to confirm for you, however if it looks like this, then yeah probably spider mites. SEGREGATE FOR TREATMENT OR TRASH THE PLANT! This can easily spread to other plants, especially if it's a house plant\n\nQuestion, if you know the answer I'd be grateful; \n\n\nI recently bought two plants from someone on craigslist. Big mistake. I went to pot my new cactus and noticed it had those distinct webs on all the spines. Thankfully they were quarantined by default because the mudroom is where I do my potting and it's two or three closed doors away from all my other plants EXCEPT two air plants and one small bamboo. Neither seemed to be having any problems, **however** when I lifted up a metal basin that I used to process sunflower seeds in the same room, I found a pile of tiny white creatures. I only realized it wasn't dust because it looked like it was moving, and sure enough up close I could juuuust make out all the creepy crawlies. \n\n\nThe fact that my bamboo and air plants were fine had me thinking that spider mites must need soil in order to colonize a plant. But that can't be true if those were also spider mites underneath the metal basin, because it was sitting on top of my worm compost bin, which is plastic. \n\n\nSo now I think I might have two different pests. But I can't use Google lens to identify either of them because both they and the webs are so small they don't show up in photos. Do you know if spider mites pile up like that, ever? Or if they need soil to spread?\n\n\nI'm a bit worried because my worms all died off at once during this same time frame and I still don't know why. I'm going to be devastated if the same thing happens to my plants, but I just do not have the money or energy to preemptively treat and repot them all AGAIN. So now I'm just sitting around feeling anxious. \n\n\nAll for two $5 plants from some random jerk. Never again. \n\nNeem oil mix spray, soft soap and/or diatomaceous earth.\n\nGood luck\n\nI've treated the plants already, at this point I'm just worried about it spreading since I found such a massive pile in such a weird spot. Like if they're just hanging out sandwiched between metal and plastic how on earth can I ever fully eradicate them, you know what I mean? \n\n\nI use neem oil and ordered some special spray that a bunch of YouTube plant accounts recommended but I am thinking of using diatomaceous earth now as well, just to be safe. Do you sprinkle it at the base of the plant, on the plant, or mix it into the soil?\n\nDiatomaceous Earth is tiny ground up shards of ancient ocean organisms. DE works by creating micro scratches in the waxy protective coating on bugs' shells that are supposed to keep moisture in.. Once they get it on them, it gets into their joints and causes them to dry out and die. It's a great general purpose bug killer, but it is only effective when dry. Once it gets wet, it doesn't work, so that's why sprinkling is more effective than mixing it into the soil. Like mentioned below, also use goggles and a mask to keep from breathing in the airborne particles because they can do the same thing to your lungs. \n\nGood luck!\n\nDiatomaceous earth is dangerous to inhale for little kids &amp; pets. I would assume bad for earthworms too. It’s basically super sharp slivers of fossilized algae which kill bugs when they crawl through it—death by a thousand cuts. Take care.\n\nOh I don't put it or any other pest control anywhere near the worm bin. I use it for slugs in the garden so I know it'll kill my worms the same way. But thanks for the heads up! \n\nDE isn't harmful to earthworms but can be to bees.\nAnd yes, very bad for lungs if inhaled.\n\nAll the instructions I've read say sprinkle around the base.\n\nThey might be different pests, however us that buy rando plants from people are effectively plant doctors, we rescue them and do what we can\n\nThe white ones in the pot may have been springtails or some sort of harmless soil mite, I wouldn't panic yet.\n\nI love bad now.\n\nExactly what I was thinking.  It does make for a stunning photo!\n\nthey killed my tomatoes i raised from seed 😭 i even sprayed neem oil/soap mixture\n\nStill a beautiful photo\n\nGracias!\n\nBut the photos awesome\n\nThanks!!!\n\nDry in your area?\nWe don't get many outdoors in my humid area but spider mites are a pretty bad pest. Lady bugs will eat them, if you're lucky native predators will move in but you might just want to buy a small thing of lady bugs from a garden shop.\n\nThe climate here is almost desert-like, very hot and the ground is in suspension... now we are in spring, but in the summer many ladybugs usually appear.\n\nThey love the dry weather. One recommended treatment is to mist the affected plant twice a day. This didn't really help me with my infestation though. I only had a small balcony garden so I actually ended up letting everything die off and have only picked it back up again now that it's been a full year\n\nOP, diatomaceous earth will take care of spider mites quickly and easily.\n\nThe ultimate Beauty and the beast\n\nThat's right! 🌹\n\nThat is 100% spider mites and horrifying.\n\nThis is absolutely lovely but you have spider mites 😭😭 they are the absolute bane of my existence. They will kill your roses and love dry soil and dry heat. Get some insecticide!\n\nSulphur works really well to kill spider mites instantly. Most indoor plants can be cured in about 5 treatments, and infrequent spraying outside will keep their numbers under control\n\nThanks for the tip!\n\nI would pay too much for galaxy roses these are gorgeous. Can somebody do this without the spider mites?\n\nlol r/houseplantcirclejerk\n\nI bet you could get an almost similar effect with thread knit or crocheted with much larger needles and beads!\n\nEdit: or even possibly a dyed/ painted hair net with a couple of small rips and either beads or glue drops.\n\nI'll try that, thank you for the suggestion.\n\nTent caterpillars instead?\n\nGothic roses\n\nThis is actually a really compelling photo with natural tension. The beauty is juxtaposed by the impending death of the flowers\n\nCould be spider mites\n\nSure!!\n\nThe goths would love this!\n\nGoth here &amp; I do!🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤\n\nI'm glad to know you liked it :)\n\nOMG - what a gorgeous picture! You should submit it for one of those nature photography contests - you could easily win in my book!\n\nIn a Galaxy far, far away...\n\nBeautiful photo! Though it gives me anxiety as someone who has been battling spider mites all summer lol\n\nFeels like out of a fairytale damn\n\nWould fit in at /r/PlantGoths/ even though it's a bit of a gore photo from a gardening perspective because of the spider mites.\n\nI think it's actually r/gothplants\n\nSpider mites.. who knew even they could be kind of beautiful 😮\n\nthis would make a nice painting\n\nWhat kind of rose is it?\n\nthat's a lot of spider mites...\n\nOMG it’s spider mites, one of the most hated pests for gardeners\n\nDamn, that is a fine looking flower.\n\nThank u very much ❤️\n\nSpray them with warm not hot water\n\nSpider mites\n\nGet out of that Enchanted Forrest…NOW!\n\nThat inevitable trauma response of those who have been victimised by spider mites. I rank them as my most hated best. Boisduval scale second.\n\nSpider mites\n\nWow these are gorgeous!\n\nThanks :)\n\nSpider mites they are a headache. But this is beautiful\n\nBeautiful but it’s spider mites. That rose bush needs fast treatment\n\n🫠🤩\n\nspider webs? spider wants aphids. brilliant tactic. the fragrance of those 3 roses might attract all kinds of things.\n\nIt's got a gorgeous look to it.\n\nThe photo itself is mesmerizing, I probably would have been stuck buffering in real time\n\nWow\n\nTake the background of greenery and they look like nebulae. Beautiful but ridden with mites.\n\nThat's quite the spider mite infestation\n\nthe perfect halloween rose\n\nMites\n\nBeautiful colors!\n\nThats a pretty bad infestation of spider mites\n\nSpider mites but make them STUNNING!\n\nSpider mites spider mites doing whether spider mites does\n\nWhen I saw this I honestly just assumed it was from one of my dark Romantasy subs lol not the gardening one. That’s so beautiful looking!\n\n😍😍\n\nSpiders mites never looked so beautiful wow lmao\n\nEmo roses?\n\nBeautiful Death By, OP\n\nGorgeous photo!\n\nBeautifully Halloween looking.\n\nis it bad i want to put it in my mouth?\n\nrose flower tanghulu\n\nThese are so mystifying and pretty~\n\nSpider mites.\n\nSpider mites!\n\nSpider mites looks like. A real bane.\n\nYour plant also may need some fertilizer.\n\nI use trifecta crop control  from early on it has kept most things away . For most of the other pests I use natures good guys nematodes\n\nThey look like nabulae. Beautiful\n\nLooks like a filter into the galaxy. 🌌\n\nI just stole this for my phone screen!  Thank you!\n\nNature is the greatest artist! \n\nIt’s honestly gorgeous! I know it’s bad though lol.\n\nI thought I was on r/analog or something\n\nThe photo was taken with the cell phone I had two years ago, I'm poor so it was actually a pretty bad Samsung hahaha I think that gives it the vintage effect hahaha\n\nAphids.\n\nWhat in the editing?\n\nWhy does the \"veil\" look blue? Spider mites right?\n\nSpider mites\n\nIt’s stunning I love them\n\nDead Jedi Force Roses\n\nThose roses are fine leave them alone\n\nSpider mites, had them on my houseplants\n\nUnfortunately they're spider mites and can wreak havoc on a rose bush. Amazing photo though!\n\nBeautiful. Looks like spider mites though.\n\nWoah… that’s stunning\n\nLooks like spider mites infestation.\nBut looks interesting 🧐\n\nLike saturation?\n\nI hate spider mites\n\nLook into a very serious Insecticide/Miticide called Avid 0.15 EC. It's systemically active throughout the entire plant once dipped or sprayed in a solution of 1.18ml per 1 gallon of water. No mites can escape. The Mites will become almost instantly paralyzed and never move again, all dead in a week. Re-apply every 7 days until all residual eggs have hatched &amp; mites are gone. The mites are sucking the life out of your plants. Minute pinholes throughout the leaves &amp; webbing are sure signs of Red Spider Mites, my most hated insect of all time, &amp; the hardest to eradicate imho. It can be used on ornamentals anytime, but not anything you're going to consume within 60 days of the last application, whether it was spraying, (not as effective as dipping, but the systemic action will get to them when they eat, as the insecticide travels within the plants), or dipping, (in a 5 gallon work bucket from your home DIY shop),  that reaches all outside surfaces of the affected plant which I prefer if the plants are small, (less the 24\"), &amp; in pots. Protective gear is required. Don't let this get on you, or in you. Wear Nitrile gloves, long sleeves, eye protection, face mask as this is very serious stuff! A 1-2 gallon pressure sprayer is great for this. Get under those leaves, as this is their lair. They are in charge as you can see by the webbing. But you are the Alfa Predator here, &amp; YOU are now in charge, having this information &amp; solution! Neem oil, lavender soap, etc., are safe &amp; organic, but not always effective against spider mites. Avid 0.15 EC is pretty expensive, so buying a whole bottle might last you many years too long, so buying it by the ounce on eBay or other similar websites is much more reasonable. Good luck saving those beautiful roses!"

This was taken this morning along the towpath in Augusta, GA\n\nI’ve only been to Newnan and Rome, GA but it was beautiful.\n\nWhere is this delightful scene?\n\nNorth Norfolk, UK\n\nMy family live in Sussex, UK with me here in Los Angeles. I really do miss this kind of environment. Just beautiful. Thanks for posting 😊\n\nWe have family that grew up in Rye! Absolutely beautiful part of the country! \n\nYou're very welcome 😊\n\nThis picture was surely taken in May.    \nWhy? The beech leaves are spring green.\n\nYes, it’s a nice scene but people think it’s recent when it’s not. It’s pretty late autumn here in UK with bare trees and some last leaves hanging on.\n\nPeople think it is recent because the title says 'this time of year'.\n\nYou’re telling me deciduous trees are covered with succulent fresh green leaves this time of year in Norfolk?🥴\n\nI took this picture a couple of years ago and think it was an autumn shot just before frosts and leaf drop!\n\nI've only just found this sub and wanted to share one of my favourite photos in so we might be a month out of sync! Although the misty mornings are way more frequent in the colder wetter months 😊\n\nThe season here has gone long this year with leaves dropping around 3/4 weeks ago here in North Norfolk\n\nOh so like a real shire, that type of view will bring me to tears.\n\nZone 4b here. Everything died 2 months ago. Oh how I wish I could be gardening.\n\nI'm growing Snow! Looks to be a good harvest this year.\n\nWe weirdly have no snow yet and none in the day day forecast which is weird. I feel like it's going to be a mild winter here. Though we have our hottest October ever, iirc so maybe it's just starting late.\n\nAlso 4b...  Northern Ontario...\n\nOnly thing in my garden that weirdly seems alive is my last bunch of spring onions lol..  Not sure how they've survived. They're sticking up through the snow.\n\nLooking closer at the OP’s photo, I’m pretty sure it wasn’t taken recently. Here in the UK trees lost their leaves already, it’s way too green and lush, look at the leaves on trees and grasses/ plants. Not happening in December, OP is full of it\n\n18F this morning in central Massachusetts. I fed my chickens a frozen-solid red cabbage this morning. Everything in our low tunnels is toast. Surprised we made it this far, tbh.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v2mmoo9d7b4e1.jpeg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=81903c497c75b805dde89c9a169c9b95026313d0\n\nFrom my back deck last year…\n\nYea , ok nice.   \nSorry , I have to go out shovel snow again.\n\nIt’s a pic from spring or summer.\n\nDid the wizard arrive precisely when he meant to?\n\nActually he was delayed, some asshole on a bridge asked him a bunch of questions.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1lexga3twb4e1.jpeg?width=1284&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=28a4458531339129f59ae53e46345d44dbadf2ef\n\nThis meme will never not crack me up. The kids face gets me every time.\n\nJealous, my garden is under 40+ inches of snow at the moment.\n\nSnow landscapes have a beauty of their own. I love the blue/purple pictures you can get from a very early dawn or a late dusk, once the oranges are gone.\n\nI love being a Redditor when posts of gardeners are like this\n\nWow! This could be a book cover for The Secret Garden\n\nABSOLUTELY GORGEOUSSS 🥹🥹🥹🫶🫶\n\nI didn’t realize you could post on Reddit from heaven\n\nABSOLUTE SERENITY!\n\nA very peaceful rising\n\nMakes me homesick\n\nWow, the lighting is so beautiful!\n\nSo pretty! It’s -26c where I am and we have 2’ of snow. It’s pretty, but maybe not for 6 months a year. *sigh*\n\nWhen did you take it? Surely not in November / December\n\nr/AccidentalRenaissance\n\nThe garden bathed in sunlight feels like a peaceful hug from nature, reminding me to stop, breathe, and maybe water a plant or two... if I remember. 🌿☀️\n\nYou're lucky or must live in the southern hemisphere if you can garden in December.\n\nI’m sure this is a photo from summer, since OP took in the UK, trust me it’s not that green anywhere atm\n\n[deleted]\n\nNot shot this time of year, but the UK really does look like that. It's an island so gets a lot of moisture.\n\nYou might wanna find a way to block my account then, cos a lot of my gardens look too good to be true\n\nJust gorgeous!\n\nAbsolutely!.\n\nSo gorgeous!\n\nWow\n\nNice property too ;)\n\nA beautiful dawn in the forest glade\n\nWow this looks amazing.\n\nStunning! Looks like they have a decent size garden? Beautiful 🙂\n\nThis would make a fantastic mural\n\nAre you perchance an elf, halfling, gnome or any combinations of the above?\n\nGiving the secret garden vibe.\n\nIt's so pretty!\n\nThat looks like a scene from a 90s movie\n\nWow, I’m jealous!  Thanks for sharing this beauty!\n\nUnreal!\n\nBeautiful...\n\nLooks so beautiful, but also a bit eerie at the same time\n\nThis is beautiful and peaceful . I wish this was my backyard thank you for sharing this wonderful picture🙏\n\nLooks outside.\n\nYep... Still Snow...\n\nNice view - quite serene\n\nWoah 😳\n\nThis looks so beautiful aw 😊\n\nThis is what I imagine heaven to me. Having green all around me doing my own garden ☺️\n\nSo pretty and peaceful looking 😍👏🏼\n\nSoooo beautiful!\n\nso beautiful\n\nYou still have leaves on trees?\n\nSuch a pristine garden! I love it.\n\nEnchanting OP.\n\nSpring time I take it?\n\n\"I don't think we're in Texas anymore, ToTo!\"\n\nBeautiful! I'd love early morning gardening, too ... if I lived anywhere but Texas. \\*sigh\\*\n\nSo peaceful …\n\nwell it helps if you live at heavens gates apparently😍\n\nThe opposite of my climate 🤣\n\nUnreal!\n\nWow! So perfect that it looks like AI. \n\nabsolutely stunning!! 😍😍😍😍\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3qjjc7vq8h4e1.jpeg?width=934&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fae67cd5ba76c2e1b9cfcf6ebdebb75e4f275220\n\nThanks for reminding me that I am in paradise.\n\nThat gate will keep me warm this winter when I burn it! The picture is fire!\n\nYou have found the secret garden! 🌷🌹🪷🪻\n\nThis is enchanting! What a beautiful shot and I love the gate\n\npart of me was gonna say i cant believe thats in the UK but i live in london so i cant say anything XD\n\nI remember this photo from my dreams last year!!! I was in this scene and location photographed here and I saw a death taking place there. It was odd but I enjoyed being with the plants and trees!\n\nman look at that heavenly sunlight😭\n\nI would rather call it a forest than a garden. I am surprised by how big and amazing it is"

    "all_comment_text": "Ok, but now I want to see the nighttime footage with the opossums and the raccoons! 🤣 Amazing. I'm pretty jealous.  My squirrels just throw hazelnuts at me while they cuss me out.\n\nLmao the nighttime footage im out there with the chickens and ducks having gossip 😂, and ye the squirrels know to stay away from my yard, there Aholes they come over here and all the other animals leave.\n\nChicken gossip is the best. You should hear out what the geese have to say as well, just the one time though because you’ll be deaf after.\n\nI used to have little Douglas Squirrels when I lived more in the country. A Grey looked like a battleship compared to them, but those little guys gave no quarter!  Now I'm more in town, next to a park with a hazelnut hedge around my house.  There are A LOT of Grey squirrels in my world. 🫠\n\nAre you in Oregon? I’d never seen a Douglas squirrel before I moved to Oregon. They are small, but feisty. I’ve seen one face off with 4 grey squirrels and scare them all away.\n\nYou’re like a real life “Joe White” so cool! \n\n(As in Snow White but not a woman)\n\nWe put water out all summer because it gets hot here in CA. We get skunks, foxes, deer, coyotes, and jackrabbits on our game camera.\n\nWho's winning the game so far?\n\nThe camera sellers!\n\nWould like to see this footage of hazelnut throwing 😂\n\nChickadees are my favorite little birds! And they just fly on up to you. I’m so envious!\n\nThere also my favourite bird, and anywhere I am in the yard if there’s no food they will fly right over to me, even if I scare them they will fly back to me\n\nMine like to yell at me if the feeder is empty 😂\n\nAgreed!\n\nYears ago when I lived in a different house I used to feed the hummingbirds and all I got were demands from them. When the feeder got empty they would stare in my window at me. It got to where I’d be watching tv and I’d turn around because I could feel their tiny eyes boring into the back of my head.\n\nAwwwwwww 🥹\n\nYou would think it would be that. They were a bunch of little assholes. The feeder had four spots, they’d argue and fight over one and ignore the other three. If I was outside and it was low they’d buzz past me. This was mainly the males, I didn’t see as many females.\n\nThat's wildlife for ya. But still,\n\nAwwwwwwwww🥹\n\nYeah, they’re lucky they’re pretty and entertaining 😂😂😂\n\nTo have the trust of so many animals is MAGICAL\n\nI think animals really know how to judge a person, there really observe for a long time before becoming friendly.\n\nOr maybe you're secretly a Disney princess. Hahaha!\n\nYou're like a Disney princess! They just flock to you ❤️\n\nThat’s how it feels I just open my front door , and there all out there waiting for me\n\nyou’ll have deer and chipmunks washing the dishes in no time\n\nLol I hope so 😂 it’s full time they start helping out around here\n\nAlllvinnnnn!\n\nAdopt me please, that’s all I’ve ever wanted from life\n\nYup! My thought was… Cinderella is real!\n\nI was thinking Snow White! 🤣\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/5rv6cms0cimd1.gif\n\n😂\n\nThought the same. They must have lovely energy ✨️\n\nYou must have a gentle, patient spirit for them to be unafraid. Thank you for sharing! 🙂\n\nI think they found me in my most calming space and that’s in my garden u sed it best, gentle patient spirit, I feel like that’s me when I’m in my garden, and just showed the same love to the animals ❤️\n\nI go on my garden and hold out seeds and food for animals and no animals come near me. Just my neighbors focusing me on their phones and posting me on their social media feed calling me a weirdo\n\nThe only \"animal\" that's been receptive of me is a goddamn bald faced hornet.\n\nIt took 3 months before it started to happen and I didn’t hold my hand out I actually just not the animals started to come to sit by me and that’s when I realize , oh they wanted food ! From that moment they started coming around. \n\nAnd lol u gave me a good laugh 😂\n\nWhat was your process? Did you have to remove your feeders?\n\nI’ll try to explain it short, but it started with a chipmunk in April and I kept feeding that one then by June I had feeders at one spot beside the garden, they animals would always come there, and as I started notice I put less food at the feeder so they would slowly start coming to me, but they knew I was the food source\n\nI love this!  Thanks for sharing!  The hummingbird had me going: wooooowwww\n\nNo prob it was really cool feeding the humming bird, it had babies here also ! Did u notice my humming bird sign in the back ?\n\nWatching you feed the wildlife is awesome. They know you have a gentle spirit &amp; kind heart. \nThank you for sharing your garden &amp; the wildlife. \n\nI didn’t see the hummingbird sign.\n\nChickadees are not shy lol\n\nThis should be posted on r/MadeMeSmile\n\nI smiled watching this,  thank you for caring.\n\nIs your name Snow White? You’re like a Disney princess\n\nI’ll go by Disney’s Princess 😂 I could be Snow White but I’m black lol jokes 😂\n\nSnow Black? ;) Disney remade little mermaid  …🧜‍♀️ just sayin you could easily play Snow White, the animals clearly LOVE you 🤍\n\nLol I think I have to contact Disney 😂😅\n\nDon’t feed racoons. I regret ever night I did. They have destroyed my backyard and surround me now. It is a huge issue to get rid of them.\n\nAnd there is raccoon but I’ve only seen 1 in 4 years, I get what u mean tho, certain animals I don’t feed so they don’t linger here, for example fox and skunks\n\nI have 5, well now four left to trap. They are not easy guys to get rid of.\n\nThis is wonderful for you.   They trust you to be friend.  \nBrilliant.\n\nAnimals are really smart from what I see, they all watch each other and over time become more comfortable.\n\nAmazing. Let me know when you start a YouTube channel. 💞\n\nOk will do 😊\n\nDisney princesses move over!\n\nAll in 🤩fun. Nature is beautiful and amazing and it's quite awesome that you have so many little creatures comfortable around you. \n\nMust be wonderful!\n\nAre the ducks nice to the chickens?\n\nI’ve always been curious because I’ve heard bad stories that the ducks are bullies but I have a strange feeling you’re injecting them with 100% kindness.\n\nMy ducks and chickens get along extremely will , they been living together for over 1.5 years and haven’t had no issues, I also have a big pool in there and both the ducks make, the only thing is sometimes the ducks get a little rough with the chickens but I think the like it, because they never freak out or run, and my ducks never tried to hump the chickens either.\n\nYou *are* a Disney princess! \n\nI'm a city girl, birds landing on me would nope me right the fuck out.\n\nLol I’ve been getting a lot of that, and the small birds are not to scary it’s just the bigger ones like blue jays that’s a bit trippy\n\nAre you a Disney  Princess?\n\nShhh 🤫 don’t tell anyone\n\nWhat flower was for the hummingbird?\n\nNasturtiums.\n\nU nailed it ! Your right\n\nNasturtium\n\nSo have you got them well trained, or have they got YOU well trained?\n\nThat’s a good one I think their the one that have me well trained 😂, the fact I stop what I’m doing to feed them\n\nI love the birds eating from your hand. A robin follows me around the garden and I do feed him. He's come as far as my shoes, I must try the birdseed in the hand!\n\ni don’t know how this ended up on my feed. that looks cool as fuck. keep up the good energy and vibes bro\n\n[removed]\n\nYe it all started with one chipmuch I fed from spring and then it stayed all summer and all the other animals stated to follow, and that’s so cool!\n\nLove it. Very in tune with nature! 🥰\n\nThank you and yes nature helps keep me grounded.\n\nThis is the most heart warming post. I truly felt such peace and happiness in your beautiful back yard. Thank you for sharing.\n\nThank you 😊😊🐿️🐥\n\nStop feeding wildlife!  Especially gross peanuts. They are absolutely not good for you or wildlife. \nIt’s not ok to normalize feeding wildlife.\n\nSo you’re the reason I have all these damn chipmunks in my garden.\n\nMeanwhile me trying to befriend a fucking pidgeon for two years and still nothing.\n\nYou are my new favourite person on the internet. This is so cute.\n\nYour garden is an oasis.\n\nYou are obviously a Disney princess.\n\nOkay! It's giving snow white! Or should I say grow white? Lol that's awesome 😍\n\nThat reminds me… I have to get some peanuts.\n\nYou must be a Disney princess\n\nAre you a Disney princess?\n\nI love that you love your local species and know them individually, that is super awesome and sorely needed in our society, however, please don’t feed the wildlife - I’m a wildlife biologist and have seen how feeding wildlife causes so many issues for both humans and wildlife (problems with  their immune system, disease spread, changes in their gut’s microbiome, and ultimately more human-wildlife conflict) and puts wildlife in danger because they become habituated to humans. Not all humans are friendly and people can take advantage of that habituation to hurt them. You clearly have a kind soul and just want to help, so I would encourage you to plant native species for them to feed on instead. This gives them food, natural habitat (loss of which is the primary cause of species decline and extinction!), and prevents them from becoming habituated to humans and becoming dependent on humans for food.\n\nIt hurts to see other people living your dream\n\nare you st Francis?!\n\nHow does it feel to be a Disney Prince?\n\nShow us what it’s like at night time I bet there’s even more👍🏼🤗\n\nI feed chickadees on a local trail.  I love the little frrrrrrrrt noise their wings make.  I often hear them before I see them.\n\nSnow White has nothing on you, hahaha. How lovely!\n\n[removed]\n\n*Disney enters the chat*\n\nLol they might copyright me now 😂 jokes\n\nThe bird in your hand!!!?!!?!!?!\n\ni also want to be a disney princess! :(\n\nThank you .\n\nSo blessed to have this in your garden.\n\nIt’s really a blessing\n\nYou are a Disney princess, i am jealous :)\n\nthat's great, mine never get close except my hummingbirds\n\nAnd here I am locked in mortal combat against deer eating everything.\n\nHow blessed you are.This is a slice of paradise!!!\n\nThis melted my heart. You're awesome.\n\nLook at you, doing proper human things.  Keep posting! ❤️\n\nr/humansbeingbros\n\nI'm at loss for words... What a lovely life you have there.

Glad you have little buds that appreciate your hard work and love of nature ♥️\n\nPretty impressive that they’re eating from your hand\n\nYes, gardening is such a rich blessing, that leaves your heart full every single day! I swear this melts away my stress and the pressures of this life.\n\nYou have tiny, cute animals...Meanwhile, I'm playing with crows 😅\n\nSide note: I'm hoping to train them so I can do Crow Clone Jutsu\n\nDude!!! 🌸❣️👌🏼\n\nCue theme from Snow White.\n\nLove this so much your place is wonderful\n\nI hope you live a peaceful and happy life. Thank you for sharing this video with us.\n\nI'm like .. that's not what chickens sound like, then the camera panned to the duckies\n\nInspiring!\n\nHow cool that the birds will land on your hand!\n\nChika-dee-dee-dee\n\nOh man, that’s so cool - you’ve gone full Doolittle!\n\nAnimals paradise ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️\n\nYou *really are* a Disney princess!! 💕\n\nAre you…are you a Disney princess?\n\nYou should not feed the wild life. It messes up with the natures balance\n\nWell, that’s so cool. I’d like to live there.👍🏼🤗🤣\n\nNo way that little hummingbird is out of this world!  Where do you live in a forest? You’re so lucky.🤗🤣\n\nRad\n\nAbsolutely amazing\n\nGoals\n\nYou're a real life Cinderella!!! (Or cinderman? Lol) 🥹😍\n\nBoth and neither. Being a Disney Princess is a aura and OP got it\n\nThis is my dream!

    "all_comment_text": "Cool geodesic/igloo thingy!\n\nI’d hotbox that igloo thingy so hard\n\nYou know it\n\nThank you\n\nCan I ask you how old the geodesic dome is, and what materials it’s made of? The things have an allure for me, I‘m just skeptical how long they will hold up before they’re scratched all over and/or dull and/or cracked.\n\nI think it was from here https://www.geodomex.com\n\nI could probably sell these in S. Florida and just call them \"People Cookers!\"\n\nPssh, I'm in AZ it we are riding 100 straight days of 100 degrees straight. Yeah the humidity sucks in FL (I went to boot in Orlando) but you want to talk about cooking people?? 90F and 80% sucks because it still sucks in the shade, or even in your house, but try standing in the sun when it's 116 like it was last week.\n\nSooo nice. Also crazy that your neighbors have zero plants.\n\nNot uncommon with some British gardens, especially new builds, unfortunately. My brother and his girlfriend just spent hundreds tearing up their lawn to put in fake grass… I’m also seeing more commonly people are tearing out their gardens to fully concrete it. Look at this. I think about it all the time and it makes me so sad:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xnaa2v9dz4nd1.jpeg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8a20ef6499d576ffd88641675ceb3a0fff6eda6d\n\nI’ve lived in Canada for years and I recently went home to visit for a couple of months and it’s one of those things that was almost like a reverse cultural shock.  I couldn’t get over it.\n\nOh man, that photo absolutely crushed me. Faith in humanity destroyed.\n\nThe photo is so blurry I thought the garden was just dark grey concrete; it looks a bit better on other pictures, but still hideous. Not a single plant anywhere in the garden. The patio must be absolutely boiling on a hot day. \n\nhttps://www.rightmove.co.uk/properties/135789014#/?channel=RES_BUY\n\nSorry, I had to do some extensive keyword specific googling to find the pic because I saw it on Reddit ages ago and forgot where specifically it was!\n\nNo need to be sorry for anything, and I wouldn't have found out how bad the interior was without doing a quick reverse image search! One of the lounges has a giant mirror against the wall so you can gaze at your reflection instead of the TV. You can also get a full view of their back 'garden' from the pavement.\n\nShit like this should be a criminal offense.\n\nWell some places charge you a few the increase with the amount of runoff your property creates. It's not jail time but it is an ongoing fine.\n\nSame thing happens in the Netherlands. When I am walking in a neighborhood and I see rows of concrete gardens it actually makes me sad. If there are nice houses with a garden the contrast is even worse.\n\nThe fake grass gets me as well.\n\nThe astroturf/concrete small yard thing was a phase in the late 70s. The early 70s was all about green spaces &amp; organic farming. It was a wild decade.\n\nThat is hideous🤮\n\nLove it! This is my favorite kind of r/gardening post, where you get a sense of the shapes and proportions overall. I love the mix of plants and ceramics.\n\n“Small” lol this looks insane!!! I’m jealous 😭 how long did this take?\n\nIt’s only 5m wide and 9m long. Took me a few weeks to do this design (I’ve changed it around a lot)\n\nLooks awesome either way ❤️\n\nYo where’d you get that dome?\n\nIt’s from geodomex online\n\nIt's so fun!!! What do you do to keep it so clean?\n\nClean it probably\n\n🤣\n\n[deleted]\n\nThank you\n\nStunning! I LOVE your Allium!\n\nYes! I live in South Africa and we don’t get those here, so I drool over them on the internet. Lovely use of them OP\n\nWow 🤩\n\nMonty Don would approve\n\nLove the dome! How smart in a cool, rainy area!\n\nYou are doing everything right. This is stunnninggg!\n\nOutstanding work 😍\n\nWould LOVE to see evening or pictures at dusk\n\nSo this is what heaven looks like.\n\nThat’s beautiful, well done! Does it get really hot in the bubble?\n\nAbsolutely stunning.\n\nAdopt me, please!?\n\nDream garden\n\nCan I live in your garden??\n\nA lil slice of heaven 😍 wow! ✨\n\nThis is so inspiring - what a gorgeous lil’ sanctuary you’ve created 😍\n\nWow, that’s an amazing garden. Completely enchanting and yet so serene. 🦋\n\nI'm so in love with this I can't stand it *twitch*\n\nI'm calling Greg Davies to inform him you stole the dome from the Taskmaster house\n\nThis is an amazing garden! So beautiful!\n\nHere comes the buts...\n\nI know it's probably not intended, but Buddha heads are really not a good decor. Back in the days, lots of ancient statues got destroyed by colonial people who cut the heads of the statues off and took them back home. And the headless statues were left in the colonized countries. It was a sad period of time in human history and happened not long ago. \n\nThat's why I feel a whole Buddha statue decor is much better than a Buddha head decor. It's much more neutral/harmless.\n\nTo add to this, many Buddhists consider it irreverent to place a Buddha statue on the floor, or below the level your head- they should be placed high up. It would be similar to placing random statues of Jesus around your garden as decoration. They also don't like Buddha tattoos. \n\nThe garden is really beautiful and OP should be proud of all their hard work, just spreading general awareness of this.\n\nEdit: also many Buddhists also wouldn't care. Everyone is different.\n\nThis! It's also just kind to be culturally respectful, especially if a culture and its iconography is maybe not your own. \n\n\nIf OP is Buddhist, all power to em in how they use their culture and religion. If not, a bit of sensitivity goes a long way in acceptance of one another.\n\nThank you for sharing this piece of knowledge. I have a buddha head as a decoration, and I'm probably not going to get rid of it because of what you said, but I won't buy another one anymore.\n\nHoly cow, that’s so awesome!\n\nVery beautiful! I thought that was a mini biodome in the back at first!  Love the whole space! View is gorgeous!\n\nDelightful oasis! Must be cozy in the dome on grey rainy days. Love it!\n\nWow. Just wow!\n\nGood Lord!\n\nBusy compared to next doors , awesome.\n\nMagical!\n\nI wanna see in the dome\n\nAmazing garden!

I had a thought just now, as someone who gardens. It’s at the same time, fantastic AND a bit misleading when we are all posting these wonderful photos of the bounty, and sometimes the failures, we all get to experience. The reality, commonality is the WORK that we ALL put in. It could be a single tomato plant in a windowsill pot to acres of land that require motorized equipment, the work is always there…and we love it. Maybe we get a little tired and or frustrated at times, but we all continue to put in the work…just kind of a cool epiphany. It’s my therapy for sure.

I've tried beer traps, I've tried netting them. I just don't know what to do\n\nTry crushing a few egg shells spread onto the surface of the soil!\n\nOk I will give that a go. Thanks!\n\nWhat hardiness zone are you in? I have seen people do so many impressive things on an acre or less, just curious about the length of your growing season.\n\nWithin 5-7\n\nGorgeous garden!

This some new alpha lingo?\n\nWAIT I DIDNT PROOF READ IT\n\nJealous of your big strawberry patch. We don't have much space for ours to spread out, so I've kinda fenced them into a smallish square. Seems I need to thin out the patch to get our yield up again. Love fresh picked strawberries.\n\nWonderful!\n\nAmazing!\n\nStrawberries are never as sweet as when you pick them ripe from your own garden! 😻\n\nThat’s so many strawberries!! Very nice!\n\nGood work!\n\nNothing better than fresh picked strawberries!! Great job 👏\n\nYou’re living the dream!! 🙌🏼\n\nLove homegrown strawberries, they're fabulous!

I wonder what else you have growing.\n\nthose strawberries are so beautiful. great work! keep it up!!!\n\nBased on that picture. Your garden is impressive.

    "all_comment_text": "sirfetch'd\n\nFun fact, the reason farfetch'd is called that, and is a duck with a leek, is because in Japanese cuisine duck is almost always served with leeks, and there's a saying that's basically \"a duck arriving with its own leek\" as in a live duck flying up to you conveniently carrying the leek to be cooked with it. It's means a far fetched situation, hence \"farfetch'd\".\n\nIn case anyone else in here is still missing the context, farfetch’d is the name of a Pokémon that looks like a duck holding a leek.  \n\nI thought I was missing some hot new cultural reference, but I was actually missing one that’s been around for 30 years.\n\nI thought we were still trying to make “fetch” happen which is also not hot or new.\n\nI SAID YOU CANT SIT WITH US!!\n\nYou're not my real mom!\n\nWhatever. Those rules aren’t real anyway.\n\nI mean I got it, like, far fetched is “this can’ have happened” and fetch is like “it’s happening” I mean she had plenty of smart and genuine thought behind it. It was way more cleaver than a lot of the crap kids come up with now. I just thought it was kind of cool watching those 25+ yo women trying to pass as teens. lol.\n\nThese top 3 comments went so hard im so glad I kept reading\n\nTy\n\nAhhhhh ok. That makes perfect sense now!\n\nThanks, I thought that dudes comment was out of left field. Thanks for the context.\n\nI completely forgot this Pokémon existed. Child me was so unimpressed by it while playing Pokémon Yellow. The leek was such a random weapon. Now I know seeing it as withing context must be it must be like as if your food came back to life with a revenge.\n\nSo that's why all the hen houses with ducks in them had leeks growing in their fenced and canopied yards! I grew up in an Air Force town with a sizeable Asian population and I guess that influenced how they planted their farms. I'd always wondered why I only saw it there and not in any of the other places that I lived.\n\nThank you for this, I’m going to tell someone this in then years and they’re going to ask where I learned that. And I’m going to say I have to idea. But it was you\n\n[deleted]\n\nThe german name is a combination of leek and lancelot\n\nI never knew of this idiom, that’s fantastic! I don’t keep up with Pokémon but I love happening across some etymology of their names a couple times a year lol\n\nAnd to add to the Farfetch'd lore, its Japanese name is \"kamonegi\", meaning \"duck leek\". Its a shorthand for the saying that you described. The saying is used to refer to someone who is naive or easy to take advantage of. It has sometimes been translated to something like \"along comes a sucker just begging to be parted from his money\". Because of this saying, in japanese language someone who is easy to take advantage of is referred to as \"kamo\", a duck.\n\nIn Pokemon Red and Blue, the way to get Farfetch'd is by trading a Spearow to an NPC, getting Farfetch'd in return. Spearow is superior to what you receive, as it evolves into a lot stronger Fearow. So in a sense, the game makes the player the \"kamo\", by taking something valuable and giving the worthless Farfetch'd in return. In Japanese, the mockery is a lot more apparent. But in English, lost in translation so as a joke quite far fetched I'd say.\n\nSo it’s like saying “as likely as a hog arriving with its own bbq sauce.” Heh\n\nThanks\n\nOmg this is amazing\n\nLook at its Pokédex entry too.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p18zlsb6bbwd1.jpeg?width=881&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=85540a1367d73dcc221a6f9138680a985a0448da\n\nThe answer I was looking for 😂\n\nhahah i had to check if this was r/Pokemon or r/gardening, love that! Ive been collecting both veggies and pokemon these days!!\n\nI came here to post this and was not disappointed.  Very proud of my nerdy gardening family.\n\nyes. very comforting to see so many like-minded people together\n\nIt's just average...\n\nJust good lighting and he knows how to pose.\n\nWowy. This belongs here r/AbsoluteUnits\n\nyou missed an opportunity.   should have been \"r/AbsoluteUnits is leeking\"\n\nCame here to say this!!!\n\nAlso r/MightyHarvest!\n\nThe green onion she tells you not to worry about.\n\nThey’re just work friends\n\nThey’re just wok friends\n\nHa!\n\nYou have a leek in the kitchen \n\n🥁\n\nDecent, not abnormal size. Well in!\n\nI was going to reference the leeky pot.\n\nEasy pickings really\n\nIt's clear that this plant, growing with a blueberry in the pot, was playing a game of hide and leek.\n\nBeat me to it.\n\nBeet me to it. \n\nThis thing is so big it’s stupid 😂😂\n\nI understand massive pumpkins, massive watermelons, even big cucumbers. But an overgrown GREEN ONION??? Why in the world 😂\n\nWe planted green onions so pretty sure it stayed an onion.\n\nLet it go to seed and maybe you develop a variety of giant green onions 😬\n\nI was confused why everyone kept saying leek when it looked like a green onion to me…\n\n[deleted]\n\nwell played\n\nBecause it looks like a leek until you look closely at the shape of leaves.\n\nLeek-&gt;flat   \nOnion-&gt;round  \nYep, this is onion. And a freaking giant one at that!\n\nI planted green onions from the store and it looked like this, not quite as large but still pretty big.  The bulb is less bulbous than a regular onion.  We are one, it was rather pungent but OK and a little more tough than a typical onion.  I don't think you're supposed to let green onions get that big.  I planted 2, are one and now the second split into like 4 or 5 plants.  I might just let it keep multiplying\n\nDamn dude, what soil mix do you use?\n\nUranium and plutonium\n\nAt this size, if you want to use it in cooking you might want to use \\*like\\* a leek.\n\nYes. They normally grow to 7 feet if you allow time to grow. But in the US they are harvested when small\n\nGuinness’ world record book named a new record leek this year at 5’ 2.3”. If you’ve been on the internet for a bit you’ll probably recognize the guy who grew it.\n\nThat's 1.582 m for those of us freedomly challenged.\n\nAnd UK challenged\n\nAh so just skip the 1s and 8s, move the decimal, and add a 3 to convert\n\nEasy\n\n&gt; The longest scallion measures 2.532 m (8 ft 3.68 in) in length and was achieved by Agriculture and Rural Affairs Bureau of Zhangqiu District of Jinan City (China) in Jinan, Shandong, China, on 15 November 2020.\n\nScallions aren't leeks.\n\nBut the OP posted a scallion\n\nThe plant in picture is not leek. Leaves are not blades but tubes.\n\nCheck them out\n\nhttps://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=59de4d94fc229621&amp;channel=new&amp;espv=1&amp;q=%E5%B1%B1%E4%B8%9C%E5%A4%A7%E8%91%B1\n\nThis isn't a leek. Its the wrong shape.\n\nDidn't think that info had been released yet, guess someone leeked it?\n\nDo they taste worse like zucchinis if they are too big?\n\nHow long do they need to get that big?\n\nMine overwintered last year (which they absolutely shouldn't be able to do here, but it was interesting) and got about half this size. I'd imagine if they were in better growing conditions (so not my crappy raised bed), they could get much larger in that time if they didn't flower.\n\nI had to search since I do not have that experience. According to the following the traditional growth period for the very long onion is 420 days\n\n&gt; The traditional local method of growing green onions is to sow them after the autumnal equinox each year and harvest them after the beginning of winter the following year, which requires a growing cycle of about 420 days.\n\nhttp://www.news.cn/2021-12/11/c_1128153574.htm\n\nTIL.\n\nSooooooooooooooooup!\n\nStart the broth.  I’m on my way with the potatoes. 🥘🥔🧅\n\nI got the butternut squash.\n\nI have one similar. In the spring I buy green onions from the supermarket, use them as I normally would and plant the remaining bulb ends. They regrow and this gives me free green onions throughout the summer and fall. One survived the winter and resulted in a giant green onion.\n\nSome of my green onions get that big every year. They usually don’t have the greatest flavor at that size as they get kinda woody.\n\nHONEY COME QUICK THERE’S A HUGE LEEK IN THE KITCHEN\n\nThat’s what she said\n\nI came here just for this comment \n\nWe used a green onion from the grocery store and when we were done with it we just stuck the bottom part of it back in the ground and watered it consistently for a few days. It's now almost 3 feet tall and has survived multiple winters with little to no care. Of course the one plant I thought would die from neglect is huge.\n\nIt’s normal size if you are a teeny tiny human in a teeny tiny kitchen.\n\nPlease post banana for scale in case the human is tiny\n\nWhat if someone posts the world's largest banana?  And how would we even know?\n\nPlease post in r/onionlovers . What verity is this beauty because I want some.\n\nToo small\n\nI have a green onion in my aerogarden that I chopped down today. It was on its way to this. With proper nutrients and lighting, things get weird.\n\nThat's huge?!\n\ndont plant beans!  \nyou might find a giant in the sky\n\nGandalf wants his staff back.\n\nJurrasic Onion. Go easy with the MiracleGro, champ.\n\nThe soil in that pot is rich and make things big! I must go to your garden and put some of that pot soil on my chest so it becomes big too\n\nWhen I was a kid there was a TV show called land of the Giants.  Your scallion would have fit right in.\n\nConsidering my green onions I planted early this yr are 1/16 this size...I'd say YAHHHHH! \n\nThat thing is epic. From seed? Or store bought cut down?\n\nI've had a few green onions get that big. If you stick the stumps of grocery store green onions in the ground and forget about them other than to water, one or two will go insanely large.\n\nMake green onion rings!\n\nYes, they're left to grow for about 2 years in some farms in Europe. Some high end restaurants only get the ones that are left to grow for that long. They get quite big, too.\n\nWow! I need to know your variety, method, taste?\n\nThis Gerald Stratford Level.\n\nfor a extra large leek, maybe. for a scallion, no\n\nTell me you live near a reactor, without telling me you live near a reactor 😳\n\nIf you told me you had a five foot leek I’d think your story Farfetch’d.\n\nNerd hi-5 trainer.\n\nGotta catch all the shiny puns when then come along\n\nJust grow regular onions at this point 😅\n\nDon’t tell hatsune miku about this\n\nor Mikudayo will comes to your house at 3 AM..\n\nSuch info is only accessible through WikiLeeks.\n\nr/absoluteunits\n\nWHOA!!!😳😳😳\n\nThat’s what she said\n\nThat’s not a leek. That’s a flood.\n\nIt’s called a flood when they get that big….\n\nI love a good Dad joke.\n\nwhy are you in my house.....HATUNE MIKU???\n\nGiant Leek or Green onion\n\nLooks like a green onion to me, the leaves are rounded. Btw I’m no expert\n\nMight want to call a plumber for that GIANT LEEK IN YOUR KITCHEN\n\n[deleted]\n\nNo, look at the leaves. They appear to have tubular shape. Leeks would have flat leaves. This looks like an onion to me, an onion that doesn't know when to stop.\n\nAre you normal sized?\n\nMeasure with a ruler\n\nTHATS AMAZING\n\nThis is the opposite of r/mightyharvest\n\nI have a question.\n\nAbsolutely normal... around Fukushima, or Chernobyl, \n\n: )\n\nIf you are a tiny person in a miniature kitchen, then it may be.\n\nJames and the Giant Leek\n\nI hate to tell you man, but you’ve got a huge leek.\n\nYeah, if you’re the Jolly Green Giant…\n\nHuge\n\nThis is the first time I've ever seen one this size before. If you were at a fair you would win 1st prize for sure. That is really impressive. It grew in a pot with a blueberry plant? How big was the pot? Just curious... Maybe the antioxidants have something to do with it. Lol..\n\nHah fellow Fallbrook resident! Weird to see here\n\nI don't mean to alarm you but your kitchen appears to have a giant leek.\n\nIn Chernobyl, maybe\n\nAnyone seen the movie Sleeper?\n\nCloudy with a Chance of Onions\n\nDo you know Flint Lockwood by chance? 😂\n\nIt’s a little large, but the fact that your belly button is even with the countertop suggests we need a banana for scale rather than a human.\n\nPeak leek\n\nW0W !!!\n\nTake it to the basement and then ask your wife to “Go look at the huge leek in the basement.”\n\n“Hey hun, there’s a massive leek in the kitchen”\n\nI would not know what to do with an onion that big! (Okay maybe I do.. I'll sword fight it with my younger brothers, hah)\n\nIt leeks to be so!\nShe caught a leek!\nLEEKOUT!!!!\n\nI have one they survived winter and rivaled my okra this year. And there was two. I don’t know how to harvest them and honestly didn’t care. I grow things to see if I can grow things. Sometimes I eat them. This time I ignored it and it took a good chunk of my garden bed\n\nShe looks like she’s taking it as evidence, maybe it was used in an assault\n\nCall the plumber; you have a massive leek in your kitchen.\n\nLooks like a giant leek in the kitchen.\n\nThis reminds me of the movie Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs.\n\nas an onion lover this is my dream\n\nSirfetch'd or you are descendant of Bilbo Baggins? :))\n\n[removed]\n\nThat’s a Arnold Palmer leek\n\nThats the guy she told you not to worry about.\n\nThat's a huge leek. You should call a plumber before it does any damage.\n\nLooks like Arnold Palmer’s dick\n\nIt's Arnold Palmer sized.  😉\n\nThat’s the Arnold Palmer of green onions\n\ncall a plumber. I think you've got a big leak.\n\nLeeked footage\n\nThat's a monster! Now go and make some delicious soup.\n\nYeah maybe in middle earth holy cow\n\nI've seen them get thicker than my forearm, and my forearms are decently meaty, maybe 13.5\" circumference. It depends a lot on variety, though. If this was a japanese leek, this would be the biggest I've ever seen (they tend to be more like spring onions). If this was a winter titan variety, I would say this is a tad small.\n\nIf it's significantly larger than the other ones you grew, and you know your soil is good and that you fed the crop well, then yes, this is a large leek for the variety you planted.\n\nfor the Jurassic.. sure\n\nIs there a TGRI facility nearby?\n\nWow, that’s one giant lake. “Call the plumber! “\n\nA guy she tells you not to worry about...\n\nThe guys she says not to worry about.\n\nWhere's this from??   Mine would bend and die\n\nYes very normal. IF YOURE A BUNNY.\n\nI should call him\n\nAh it’s those African green onions! So big!\n\nWe don’t know the variety cause we bought generic scallions at grocery store.\n\nThe internet will tell you that's about average\n\nReminds me of the vegetables in the old Woody Allen movie Sleeper.\n\nYep. I remember. My favorite movie when I was about 12.\n\nWHAT DID YOU DO\n\nJust watered it often, but was mainly watering the blueberry plant next to it. It just got everything it wanted I guess.\n\nI'd say it's about average...idk about anyone else\n\nLooks a little small\n\nLooks pretty average size to me. Heh.\n\nIt’s average size\n\nA little small, to be honest.\n\nIt’s alright not too big, quite space saving aswell\n\nNo, it's just a really small guy\n\nA little under average tbh\n\nTHAT IS SMALL? WOW! How big is a normal sized leek?\n\nKinda small\n\nSmall\n\nTWSS\n\nIn Skyrim yes …\n\nWhat? No!\n\nIn Japan, yes."

It's a multitasking fat ass.\n\nSounds like me 😞\n\nYou breathe through a bunch of tiny holes on your sides?\n\nYes my side pores haha 🤣\n\nThose are folds, buddy\n\nGood gracious seriously!!! Now I see why it takes such a short time for caterpillars to eat my plants\n\nThey are definitely optimized for one task.\n\nDoing the caterpillar?\n\nThat’s what my husband says when I get dessert.\n\nWell, you are apparently a helluva potato.\n\nThe way I just hollered 😂😂😂\n\nThroat goat\n\nI was looking for this comment lol\n\nNotice how he didn't waste any, went to the top and mowed on south. Who said bugs are stupid?\n\nHe's definitely a porker 🐖 🐷 🐽\n\nI heard him gasping as he climbed the second stalk. It’s like me reaching for the next breadstick.\n\nWell, they don't breathe through their mouths for what it's worth.\n\nthis caught me off guard, honestly haven't stopped laughing for the last few minutes\n\n😂😂\n\nPickles don’t have to breathe…\n\nI am screaming lmfao\n\nJokes on you insects breath through their skin\n\nActually they breath through trachea. Small vein like structures to get air close to every cell in its body for gas exchange.\n\nThis gave me a hood belly laugh\n\nThis sent me 🤣\n\nI cannot stop laughing 🤣\n\nAwesome close-up! Bro is demolishing that dill!\n\nThese guys typically grow on Fennel not dill although the plants look very similar. I grew up raising them into the tiger swallowtail butterfly they’re super cool and have big orange gummy horns that come out of their head when threatened.\n\nDill and fennel are in the same family, and black swallowtails love both, as well as golden alexander, queen Anne's lace, and parsely. I don't grow fennel, but the caterpillars love my dill and golden alexander. Tiger swallowtail caterpillars mainly eat leaves of certain trees, including birch, ash, cottonwood, and willow.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vgu490htjr7d1.jpeg?width=500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f3c6d9ab4292585f452d3a0372aa33fd1471c216\n\nWonder if OP's caterpillar will pop out with those tiny little wings.\n\nSoon he’ll turn into “a beautiful butterfly!”\n\nLol we found him\n\nThe butterfly it becomes is worth the plant damage, so I guess for now you’ll just have to dill with it\n\nSage advice. 🫶🏼\n\nI know what you mint by that\n\nAbout thyme you got it\n\nred pepper flakes\n\nI beg your parsley?\n\nOregano what you’re talking about.\n\nYou mustard be kidding.\n\n[removed]\n\nYou're just trying to curry favor.\n\nI couldn’t think of any good Herb puns to add. Maybe I’ll fig ure one out at a later date\n\nI love it here. You guys never disappoint 😂\n\nNo, that's in another thread\n\nI have swallowtail caterpillars on my dill and parsley every year and you know what? Oddly enough, they grow back bushier and healthier after their caterpillar haircut.\n\nThey’re doing the pruning for you\n\nHe knows the dill\n\nHey, at least he starts at a tip and eats methodically down to the stem.   Yesterday I came out to find something had chewed through the base stem of my Malabar spinach but then just left it there to rot.  Or when birds occasionally just pick holes in a tomato without finishing it. \n\nI'm happy to share as long as they are efficient with it\n\nI dunno. None of my caterpillars have made it to the butterfly stage. I kind of rue the day I started this path\n\nThat’s the most exercise the caterpillar got this week! Haha! so cute!\n\nWhen you look up “om-nom-nom” in the dictionary, this picture comes up 🤣\n\nThere's no waste! He skootches up to the end and starts again. No biting into wherever he is on the stem and letting the end fall to the ground. I love it.\n\nThat is one hungry hungry caterpillar lol\n\nThe legends are true\n\nEric Carl didn’t lie to us\n\nIt's amazing watching these guys eat. They're so fast.\n\nI have milkweed in my front yard and one morning on my dog walk I saw a shit ton of monarch butterfly caterpillars moving in on my milkweed, like crawling up it, and one hour later when I got back I just had empty stalks. Like just straight lines coming out of the ground. Was shocked at how fast they ate.\n\nThey only have 10-12 days to eat before they pupate\n\nThis guy would crush a hotdog eating contest.\n\nHe's coming for Joey Chestnut!\n\nShit, I was just thinking, “so *that’s* what I look like eating churros.”\n\nCertified glizzy gulper\n\nLook at the little \"hands.\" So cute.  On my way out to the garden to plant more dill.\n\nMy thoughts exactly!   I must feed the cute caterpillar!  Never thought I'd be inspired by a bug video to plant.\n\nIt's so satisfying watching them live! First time I called my husband's attention to the Caterpillars on the dill he was,  \"Now, I get why you were so insistent on planting this!\"😂\n\nFinished the first one and OH LOOK! There's another one right beside it!\n\nJust needs a hookah and it's like Alice in Wonderland in your back yard\n\nI was just thinking this, it's likely exactly where the inspiration came from!\n\nIt’s likely? Bro that character is literally a caterpillar 😭\n\nBad case of the munchies.\n\nnot the little bugs running away in terror lmao\n\nIf only they ate aphids too that'd be great\n\nr/oddlysatisfying\n\nIf you watch it in reverse it's like a lil dill printer haha.\n\nSwallowtail. Love them!\n\nHad to scroll so far to find out what butterfly this would become.\n\nOk that is REMARKABLY fast! Now I better understand how a single tomato hornworm will completely mow down an entire plant overnight.\n\nDid you capture it? How? What is camera setup?\n\nIt's just a pixel 8 pro cell phone\n\nI never see mines in action. It's obviously eating, because it's getting fatter and never in the same place I saw it last 😂\n\nI planted dill specifically for this and nothing yet. Fingers crossed.\n\n... And on Thursday he ate through aaaaalllll the dill....\n\n....but he was still hungry\n\nWhat a fabulous picture. Never saw it this close up before\n\nI feel like I didn’t truly understand The Very Hungry Caterpillar until this very moment\n\nAh, it stopped too soon!  I was very curious what would happen when he ate down to the aphid!\n\nHahaha I didn't even notice them until you mentioned it. I'm guessing he ate it but sometimes the aphids drop off the plant when they feel threatened.\n\nDef first read the title as \"going down on my dill\" which honestly still works bahaha\n\nI did too 😬\n\n[deleted]\n\nBruh I've spent like $30 on a butterfly cage and dill/parsley because some fatass decided to lay like 10 of them on my original plant \n\n[https://i.imgur.com/Cprb0ZI.jpeg](https://i.imgur.com/Cprb0ZI.jpeg)\n\nYou just made my four year old kiddo’s night! Thanks for posting. 💚\n\nSwallowtail\n\nMonch monch monch…..monch monch monch🐛\n\nThe definition of \"nom nom nom nom nom\"\n\nOmfg it’s four little hands holding the dill.\n\nSix!\n\nHaha I saw the bottom two stabilizing and I was like, oh, they’re just chilling. Omggggg\n\nyour dill must be dillicious\n\nBlack swallowtail. They love dill and parsley\n\nBro is inhaling that shit!\n\ndudes got one hell of an appetite\n\nChunk Master\n\nWild. That’s exactly how I eat.\n\nI could have watched their cute little munchies all day\n\nWhat a fatty! His little legs remind me of the caterpillar in Alice in Wonderland.\n\na worthy sacrifice.\n\nI love his little \"hands\"\n\ni think this belongs in r/oddlysatisfying also\n\ngotta hawk tuah that thang ya know\n\nWild!  I literally took an almost identical video to this today.\n\nI hate dill but planted them in my new raised beds anyways solely for companion planting purposes.  I was surprised to see dozens of these guys popping up over the past week.\n\nThis morning I noticed a bunch of droppings along the top trim of one of my beds.  Immediately I thought of rosents and went to investigate, only to realize that it was these little fatties pooping up a storm.\n\nA few of the smaller guys:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o5j8zut4xs7d1.jpeg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2ff00310d994757a1554cbac3ee5f542f5f81066\n\nI can only hope that I have half as much success  breeding monarchs in my butterfly garden.\n\nLooks like those leaves are the perfect size for that mouth\n\nmesmerizing\n\nDamn little lady, you sho can put it away.\n\nVery cool!\n\nHow is this so adorable? Those little legs—I mean, come on!\n\nIs it weird that watching this cutie instantly makes me want to grow dill….\n\nThis is National Geographic level.\n\nIs this footage sped up, or did the little fat bastard really wolf down the Dill that quickly?\n\n“A future butterfly / Gonna live the day higher than high”\n\nCrazy how they make plants disappear so quickly\n\nAw! Thanks for leaving it!\n\nSo hungry.  Starvin’ little guy:)\n\nWe found it. The Very Hungry Caterpillar\n\nI realize you caught a magical moment on camera and I also know one day that fucker is gonna be a gorgeous butterfly but my *God* he looks so disgusting as a caterpillar. My skin is crawling. I have dill in my own garden and I never go check on it for fear that one of these freaks is over there. I know he's a good dude, I wish him well, but I'm gonna throw up just looking at him. Fml how can I be so obsessed with gardening but still find all bugs (especially big ass chonks like this one) to be so vile and terrifying? My whole life is a joke.\n\nBut nice video, OP, it's very high quality!\n\nimagine having all those hands to hold ya food\n\nI wonder if it tastes like pickles.\n\nI wonder what the equivalent is of this amount of eating to a human.\n\nI should call her\n\nThe John Pinette of bugs.\n\nThat’s why I always plant so much dill. Keeps them off other things\n\nThat boy has had enough!\n\nThey dont get all that chonk and demolish your plants in 2 seconds if they dont eat like that such exercise been done 😮‍💨🥵\n\nOmg when he got to the top of the first one then his hands missed it, that was so cute! Calling them a him for convenience\n\nMakes my skin crawl but those little feet are kind of adorable\n\nHe’s kind of a big dill around here\n\nThis is a fantastic video... nice shot! 🐛🦋\n\nWhat did you record this with?\n\nWow! What a cool video! I have never seen them eat before and had no idea how fast they are. Thanks for sharing!\n\nLike a big green spaghetti\n\nI grow dill even though I hate the flavor just for these lil dudes 🐛\n\nWhat an awesome video!!\n\nNice shot\n\nIs that a swallowtail caterpillar?🐛\n\na life unemcumbered by human BS. born for 1 pupa purpose only!\n\nI'm so jealous. We attempted to attract butterflies with dill and such last year but no joy 😕\n\nHypnotizing\n\nOm nom nom nom\n\nThat was so cool to watch!\n\nCongrats! I believe that's a swallowtail? Dill became a bit of a weed in my garden as it grows everywhere so they're very welcome\n\nNom nom nom\n\nHe says it is dillicious\n\nThank you for your sacrifice!!!\n\nThose 6 little hands!\n\nSo dill-igent. 😬\n\nYummy for my tummy 🤤.\n\nIt's dillicious\n\nDude, that is so COOL! Thank you for sharing.\n\nThat’s amazing. I love it.\n\nBruh we need that sound effect from old cartoons when someone eats through like a corn cob or something really quickly.\n\nWow, I have never seen a caterpillar eat like that, thanks for posting that's pretty cool!\n\nhe monch\n\nJust an absolute Dill Dozer\n\nEvery time I grow dill I get these monarchs\n\n🐛Chomp chomp chomp chomp chomp 🦋\n\nDILLicious!\n\nThis is a great video. Thanks for sharing\n\nAwww wiggle wiggle wiggle\n\nThis is fantastic and amazing.\n\nThose little fingies &lt;3\n\nMONCH\n\nr/oddlysatisfying\n\nThis video is pure quality\n\nLittle hands so adorable\n\nBeautifully shot and what an eager way to eat. Amazing.\n\nThis was oddly satisfying. \n\nI want to grow dill now just to watch this happen irl.\n\nWell, they are just taking advance payment for future pollination services.\n\nI too like dill\n\nThe hungry little caterpillar TM\n\nHer little arms are so cute\n\nsooooo chonky\n\n😍\n\nrly said \"nom nom\"\n\nYum! I love fresh dill too. So cute.\n\nGreat colors! Well shot\n\nMunch munch munch\nDelicious dill for lunch\n\nOh to be reincarnated as a chubby caterpillar….\n\nDid anybody else notice the little tiny aphid hanging on for dear life on one of the leaves???\n\nNom nom nom\n\nThis needs commentary by Sir David Attenborough!\n\nHe makes it look dill-licious!\n\nGetting ready for the big metamorphosis.\n\nI have a bunch on my dill. And that's OK, I have a lot of dill."

You are a stunning bride.\n\nYa got a tear from me. Absolutely from the heart.\n\nThank you! 💜\n\nI think the most powerful portent of this gift from your Mom is the knowledge that mere mortals (and not just florists) can grow beautiful flowers. \n\nYou can grow these flowers yourself in years to come. And every time you handle them, you'll be reminded of the love of your Mom, the joyous moments of your wedding and the miraculous celebration of life that is gardening.\n\nThat was exactly my thought.

    "all_comment_text": "Hang them up to dry like an Italian grandma\n\nThat’s a horrible thing to do to Nana!\n\n*Nonna.\n\nCorrect. That was a major gaffe on my part, one that my Italian-American in-laws up in heaven are clucking at right now. Scusa.\n\nDai, non è grave!\n\nGrazie!\n\n🤌\n\nHot stuff 🔥\n\nPeter Piper would be so jealous\n\nNah he only liked them pickled\n\ncall me peter piper cuz i am jealous of those peps\n\nI'm jealous and I'm not even Peter.\n\nPeter piper pines after peppers , pickled or plain.\n\nI like this version better\n\nincredible!! what are you gonna do with all those habaneros??\n\nI make hot sauce n got a dehydrator this year\n\nI was reading some comments on another thread from some redditors who said when they put hot peppers in their dehydrators it was like they pepper-sprayed their whole house.\n\nI was going to suggest dehydrating under a covered porch or somewhere safe outside!\n\nWe read on another subreddit that if you don't cut them in half, it's not as bad. We did notice the smell, but I think it definitely couldn't have been worse.\n\nI cut my reapers, scorpions, and habaneros in half and it was intense. I left my Thai chili intact and I barely noticed them drying. That being said, I put my dehydrator in a separate room and it's fine as long as I kept the door closed.\n\nYeah, we did habaneros, jalapenos, and Thai chilies. You definitely noticed then when you walked into the room, but after a minute, you couldn't smell it anymore. Unfortunately for us, we have an open concept so unless we went into our bedroom, there is no place to put it\n\nI started by using my oven at it's lowest temp, and babysitting it, because it was still kinda higher than I liked, but the oven seemed to help keep the smell to a minimum, since there was no airflow moving the spice. It wasn't until I got the dehydrator that I had to move my operations to my garage!\n\nYeah, I think we started ours at 125°F. It took about 12 hours. At the 9 hour mark, we bumped it up to 145 just so we could go to bed sooner, lol. We are pretty grateful that we have an air fryer with a dehydrating setting and oven also has a dehydrating setting.\n\nOh dang, fancy oven! Mine's just a regular old oven that goes down to just 165°F so I sprang for a cheap one, and now I dehydrate as low as 90! I'm so happy.\n\nYa the smell gets intense...I out mine upstairs n cover the bottom of the door w a towel\n\nIt just smells like peppers. It's not actually hard to breathe or anything.\n\nI was very proud of myself when I decided to move my dehydrator in the garage to dry my peppers. It's strong but we don't go in the garage that often!\n\nSo cool! No opposite pun intended!\n\nWhat are your plans for all of those? What a beautiful haul!\n\nMainly hot sauce!\n\nI was inspired by your picture and went and harvested mine. It is a fraction of your haul, but I am proud nonetheless. :)\n\nAs you should be!\n\nI feel inadequate with my measly poblano and shishito harvest this year, but happy nonetheless.\n\nBut poblano and shishito are sooo yummy!\n\nIndeed they are. I'm hoping I have decent seeds and can get more plants next season. Currently drying.\n\nMight try to winter over the plants I have as well. We'll see how that goes.\n\nI tried to plant a salsa garden here in the Northeast- complete failure.\n\nWhat part of the country do you live in?\n\nBaltimore\n\nhow many plants do you have to get this yield?!?! \n\nalso your bell pepper are so cute and properly shaped, mine have come out deformed the past two years🥲\n\nHa thanks...I have 4 green bell pepper plants\n\nWhat is your secret?\n\nGood soil mostly\n\nThose lemon peppers are amazing. They make a great pepper jelly and the dried flakes will add a bit of heat and zest to any dish\n\nLovely colors!\n\nIt would make a beautiful pico de gallo!\n\nThat’s a lot to freeze!\n\nThat’s gorgeous\n\nOh hell yeah\n\nGood god! OP! I didn’t even get a single pepper this year!\n\nPepper candy\n\nWow, just wow\n\nVery pretty!\n\nI bought 2 pepper plants. 1 bell, the other is a squat dark green thing, but because i lost the tags, i dont know when they will be ready. Im very clever\n\nOMG!\n\nBeautiful!\n\nGorgeous peppers!!\n\nomg this is amazing fantastic job\n\nThose peppers look 10x better than the ones at the grocery store! Excellent job growing them!\n\naji limon? love 'em\n\nThis is a dream.\n\nHoly Smokes\n\nthank you for my new screensaver! Gorgeous! Enjoy\n\nIMMACULATE. Honestly, I would dehydrate some and hang them just to have as a souvenir. Congratulations!\n\nAlso, pepper jam. Yum.\n\nYummy\n\nThis looks like it could be the photo on the cover of a 1970s cookbook called “Hot pepper cooking”\n\nOh nice. I can see ghost peppers, scorpion and lemon drop peppers. Are you going to make chilli powder, flakes or maybe hot sauce.\n\nLittle bit of both\n\nDamn that looks 🔥\n\nAbsolutely gorgeous! Nice job.\n\nWe went outside today to find that Peter Rabbit had a feast on our tomatoes and peppers last night\n\nThat damn peter rabbit\n\nWhat are those little round red peppers. They look beautiful\n\nThai cillis are the real small ones\n\nLooks like OP misunderstood you, those are probably cherry tomatoes \n\nEdit: thought they were wiri-wiri peppers at first before zooming in.\n\nOooo is the bottom middle Tabasco peppers(tiny red ones)? I have to know\n\nThai chilli's ....the small orange on the right are tabasco\n\nImpressive. I gave up on peppers and carrots. Too many bunnies and my kids get upset if they are threatened.\n\nI see some tomatos, you liar!\n\nHa you got me\n\nI grew those lemon drops and they were tasty\n\nI don’t like peppers but i have to say those looks so fresh and colorful they look tasty!👀\n\nWill someone paint this amazing still life?\n\nThese pictures would make a great puzzle\n\nBeautiful harvest. Wonderful, vibrant peppers. I only have some Scotch Bonnets myself, I definitely should plant some more.\n\nPictures 2 and 4 look like really hard jigsaw puzzles! \n\nImpressive peppers!\n\nSo pretty! Nice job!\n\nThat's an awesome harvest friend! I do really well with spicy peppers but I can never get more than a few bell peppers and they aren't very good 😢 🫑\n\nWow,\nIm curious how your garden looks like, maybe show us a short tour?\n\nI'll post some pics of my backyard garden later today...it's a labor of love\n\nCan't wait🤩\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ncul4ury3gmd1.jpeg?width=4000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4e62caae3beff85889c8ac3ada699ce90cae117a\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3tjjzid04gmd1.jpeg?width=4000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=62d71ce82686a731a1ed083096b2d0cd30663e96\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/141kv3k24gmd1.jpeg?width=4000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98685a1f0e21031d6930886155caa9b21540f186\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u3h8b7r64gmd1.jpeg?width=4000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=289db710e29a787d3fce36b91560a5f67b1206fb\n\nOh wow that is a beautiful harvest!\n\nBeautiful! So colorful\n\nAmazing!!\n\nPepper millionaire\n\nI use a dehydrator to dry mine. Grind them and use on various meals... :)\n\nDef plan on doing this\n\nWow these look amazing. I work in produce for an upscale grocery store and these look better than some of the peppers we have out rn.\n\nBeautiful array. Kudos for the variety. \nAre those yellow ones fataliis?\n\nReally really good harvest good job and keep going. I absolutely love gardening and growing my own food so this is beautiful.\n\ndo your parents help process all this? so bountiful!\n\nWhere do you or who do you trust to get the lemon drop pepper? I want to try it but we don't have any in my local store\n\nr/AccidentalRenaissance\n\nCould be used as a wallpaper, looks great!\n\nBeautiful harvest!\n\nI am in awe of your pepper raising perfection!!\n\nSuch a great harvest. Where are you located?\n\nBaltimore\n\nSize of the garden these came from? Or how much square footage was dedicated to them? We put a good number of plants into peppers this year and got a bunch of banana peppers, a few habaneros and zero bell peppers. \n\nGorgeous…😎\n\nPepper EXPLOSION!\n\nExtra jelly\n\nBulgarian carrots and lemon drops! Awesome sauce!\n\nThat's quite the r/mightyharvest you have there!\n\nBeautiful\n\nWow, someone likes peppers. I can't even grow bells. Nice!\n\nLove it!\n\nSo pretty\n\nThat last photo is so artistically pleasing 💖🙏🏻\n\nCan you post a pic of the plants?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0ps8nbb218md1.jpeg?width=2252&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9a92bbf61deafb6741a08c21056b4ea6efbea269\n\nWow!!!! What are you planning to do with all of them?\n\nCan I live with you\n\nSure but baltimore can b a little wild ha\n\n🔥🔥 i’d be soooo proud of this harvest\n\nVery colorful! I've got some ferments, a dry herb blend, a hot salt, and simple vinegar hot sauce going, amongst using them fresh in my cooking. I love peppers!\n\nwhays the green bot9m right long ones???\n\n🤤 oh sorry\n\nThat's a masterpiece\n\nSimply beautiful!\n\nGood old solenacea plants.\n\nWhat are those yellow ones?  Those ahi lemon drop peppers I hear about?  Or something else?\n\nGreat haul!!!  I don’t know if they’re the same variety as yours here but I’ve grown a light orange coloured habanero variety called “burning bush” for the last few years, absolute favourite for hot sauce no question, the flavour is incredible and they pack plenty of punch.  Just perfect.  \n\nI make a fermented-type hot sauce, kind of an “ode to Marie Sharps”, fermenting the habs, carrots, and a ton of garlic cloves in a 5% salt brine for a month or so, then adding fresh onions, lime juice, and lime zest before boiling, blending, and canning the stuff.\n\nThe yellow are lemon drop...that sounds like a good sauce might have to try that out\n\nThis is wonderfull! Thank you for posting this.\n\nBeautiful\n\nAH I'm so jealous - what will you do with all of them?\n\nNice!! Which varieties are your favorite or performed the best?\n\nMore than I've managed to grow in half a lifetime. Great work.\n\nWowzers! That’s amazing! 👀\n\nSo pretty!\n\nBeautiful colors 😍\n\nWow. Deliciousness 🤩\n\nBeautiful!!!\n\nI can devour all this in a month.\n\nHow large was the growing space?\n\nProbably 50ft by 15ft\n\nWhat are the yellow peppers (middle to the right) ?\n\nLemon pepper\n\nWow\n\nEveryone else in the family: I don't like peppers.\n\n😩\n\nI just died of jealousy.\n\nWow! How big in area is your garden? I started 1 last summer in my yard growing tomatoes, herbs, and strawberries\n\nHoly veggies!?!!!! Awesome 👌\n\nWhat’s your secret!?\n\nWow!!! What a huge harvest !\n\nWow! Goals for real here. Amazing haul!\n\nWhat’s your secret?\n\nHoly crap\n\nWhat zone are you in? My 8b garden could never!!! Gorgeous harvest.\n\nSo pretty it could be a phone wallpaper! Congrats on the harvest!\n\nThis person does not live in western Washington!\n\nWow that’s such a beautiful sight!!\n\nBeautiful photo!\n\nAmazing!  Hot, spicy is my jam."

It’s wonderful. I keep finding sleepy honey and bumble bees napping on them. It’s simply adorable!\n\nThat’s another gorgeous one wow 😮\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/35oc3fe6omkd1.jpeg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c51c4ee3ac15d84aa5d417293df05468183d65a0\n\nI got some kind of Burpee sunflower variety pack. It had about 4 different varieties. They are all gorgeous. I planted a dozen or so in the same giant grow bag. I can’t believe how tall some of them are (6-7ft).\n\nNow I have free seeds for next year!\n\nYou left your plant in the oven too long\n\nHahaha. Who doesn’t like something a little well done?\n\nIt’s like extra toasty cheese it’s. Yay!\n\nGod dammit Marie callender\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9kae4cf7rpkd1.jpeg?width=1064&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a804c544c4513b0dfdc5642da59df4bfec6687f\n\nyes!! the dark sunflowers are the best! no editing on this pic! here’s a [link](https://www.rareseeds.com/sunflower-chocolate-cherry) to where i purchased mine for anyone interested!\n\nThe birds and squirrels absolutely demolished my darker ones as soon as they bloomed lol. Also, r/plantgoths\n\nyesss, the caterpillars and grasshoppers loved all of mine this year! i just posted there! thank you\n\nI hate you a little bit because I clicked that link….now I have 35 packets of seeds in my shopping cart.\n\nOo! I’m growing these next year, now I’m even more excited\n\nI’d die for her\n\n❤️\n\nIt may not produce the same flower - especially since you have multiple varieties in one location - I’m saving (other types of) seeds anyway and hoping for the best haha\n\nThat's a beaut.\n\nThank you! I wish I kept the packaging with the names. I wrote the names on wooden markers, not realizing it would fade over the season. \n\nA quick google search points to Chocolate Cherry. I’m loving these dark sunflowers!\n\nNext time put tape over the marker and it will stay. I learned the hard way but had lots of wooden sticks to use and didn't have any other need for them. I didn't want them to go to waste so I just put clear tape over it and it stays much longer (unless it's in direct sunlight but usually they're shaded by the plants).\n\nThis one looks like Velvet Queen.\n\nThank you! I absolutely could be wrong. There were no shortage of similar looking varieties.\n\nI thought so too. Love these, I grew mine in 1 gal pots and they topped out around 60-65 in tall each.\n\nGoth sunflower.  Love it\n\n“Tonight will be the night I will fall for you, over again.”\n\nDid not know they came so dark. Looks like you cooked it too long. So pretty though! &lt;3\n\nI love goth flowers\n\nThis one is so neat\n\nThank you. I have more blooming every day. It’s so exciting!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pz1ols45omkd1.jpeg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=54a64ca718648a36e834dc3dd130a8187b5f4be0\n\nThis is the one I grew last year they ended up almost 12ft high loved it\n\nYours is also stunning! I have a slightly darker version of yours as well. I’m only 5’5” and they just tower over me.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5263uhi3omkd1.jpeg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5140e5a6a1b818a75a7986445c147fe4e9f1a488\n\nSo jealous. I’ve been trying to see a sleepy bee all summer!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jtq2y6eqyokd1.jpeg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cee92e79ed47bda8618a8e6c93970a81c47545c6\n\nSo hard at work. I love watching them all swoop in.\n\nPlease relay that i thank them for their service 🫡 Nothing but respect for the pollinators! (Also ty for bee pic!)\n\nI'm trying to follow and see, did you get these from planting bird also? They are absolutely beautiful and I don't think I have ever seen the colors before. If you did use birdseed I will have to try next year.\n\nI did not. They were part of a Burpee multi pack of sunflower seeds. They came out way more beautiful than I pictured.\n\nr/beebutts\n\nOoooo this is so cute! Joining right now.\n\nThis morning I was checking for seeds and I startled a bee napping in one \n\nI never used to pay attention to it but it’s unbelievably sweet. I had two who didn’t move for at least 5-10 minutes. Clearly resting with their little bodies vibrating a little.\n\nThat happened to me! I carefully chose seeds, planted them in a smart pot in nice dirt, fertilized them, sang to them, the whole nine yards. They hated me. At my office, under my bird feeder, *in the landscape rocks in the shade* sprouted sunflowers so perfect I thought they were fake. I was so pissed off and delighted.\n\nHa! The nerve! 🤣\n\nIt's so frustrating when they don't appreciate all of the love we give them! 😂\n\nI bought 4 heirloom varieties of tomato this year from Home Depot, already sprouted with flowers and everything. Planted them in full sun but put a shade over them for the middle of the day. Had them auto-watered on a drip timer every day. Fertilizer and lime every 2 weeks. Got 1 sorry little cherry tomato between them all before they literally just gave up and died. \n\nBought a Walmart tomato and sliced it up, buried the slices in some potting soil, and they’re only about 8” high so far but their stalks are almost a half in thick already and they’re full of flowers… I give up trying and I’ll just plant Walmart veggies straight in the ground next year lol\n\n/r/SuccessfulFailure or /r/AngryHappiness - your choice.\n\nSame here. I don’t get it. I’ve thrown so many packets of wildflower seeds in my front yard and nothing. 🫤\n\nBe careful with wild flower seed mix I did the same in one spot and now I’m battling creeping Charlie it never ends\n\nYes!!! I grew bird seed sunflowers this year for that reason. They seem hardier \n\nSame! I live in CO, so the sunflowers are POPPING this time of year. I wanted some for my yard, so I dug like 12 seeds out of my bird feeder and 11 out of 12 came up lmao.\n\nIt's because you planted them in a small pot. They need root space, unless you're growing dwarf varieties\n\n\"pissed off yet delighted.\"\n\nI know this so well! 😆\n\nAs a first time gardener I live in this state for a year now\n\nDon’t ya hate that when that happens. But then Mother Nature comes along and POW 💥 FLOWERS🌻🌻🌻\n\nWhat did you sing to them? I heard they like Elvis.\n\nIt looks like a Ruby Eclipse. 😍 I've been trying to grow them from seed for months!!\n\nI guess you know now that bird seed Ruby Eclipse is the way to go.\n\nI agree, looks exactly like Ruby Eclipse!  Mine were never this pretty though!  OP- let it go to seed and save them so you can grow more next year!\n\nThere's where you went wrong! You actually *tried*. Nothing flowers hate more than being told where to grow 😂\n\nMe too! My daughter grows a whole box of sunflowers every year and we bought some of these seeds and they never sprouted! Guess i gotta get birdseed instead 😂\n\nMy favorite: strawberry blonde hybrid Burpee sunflower. But yours is gorgeous!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e3vudtzjfmkd1.jpeg?width=2973&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a40696d9494b30fefff7b890a1abff55d992775a\n\nOooo I love this one!\n\nI know! Burpee nailed their hybrid sunflowers.\n\nTotally agreed!\n\nOMG WOW!!!! 🤩 gorgeous\n\nI was thinking about buying those giant buckets of sunflower bird seed at Home Depot for $40 and planting those…\n\nThey work out great apparently anytime I buy packs of seeds I get nothing so I def recommend just planting some bird seed\n\nSo interesting. When I was looking at the price point i was like it makes sense to just buy the gallon bucket vs 2.99 seed packets that give you 10-15 seeds 😂 \n\nExcited to try this! Thanks for sharing :)\n\nMaybe the packets are sitting on store shelves for years and the bird seed has a higher turnover / fresher\n\nHoly shit, I was sitting here wondering why they would be having a tough time. I buy my seeds online from a non-gmo source 'allegedly' who I find their politics not great but they offer some wild varieties of seeds and I have always had success germinating them. \n\nYour theory makes sense.\n\nSunflower bird seed? Any particular type?\n\nI buy them for the birds. Then have tons of sunflower sprouts all over.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e6khovl86nkd1.jpeg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b8b54e2b038159d6b5450da949a698755afca7ef\n\nFrom my bird seed mix\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1gwok6ipgnkd1.jpeg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=32a3fcd7f9ed199608d3e1f317dbc5862efbfbb0\n\nNext to bird feeder…\n\nI do this with beans every spring. I buy a $3 bag of 15-bean soup, make 3-4 2” deep lines in the soil next to a 6’ wide trellis, dump them in about 1” apart, and cover them with soil. Then make soup with the rest.\n\nWe pick enough to have a different kind of steamed beans 3 nights a week. It’s usually our “protein” for dinner - so it’s a big money saver.\n\nI have wanted to do this for forever! I just assumed the store-bought beans had been dried at high temperatures for long storage and wouldn't sprout. Gonna try this in the spring!\n\nthese kinda look like the “chocolate cherry” sunflowers we grew this year! i love all the different colors they can grow\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xlwkr1ibnnkd1.jpeg?width=1023&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b54c45185069deed6076badba5488fee3382e89c\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j491uylgnnkd1.jpeg?width=1064&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ea52ac885cb170f8d9b306c3de4baafb4f5569b6\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8rbfeutinnkd1.jpeg?width=1136&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4fd9fdda1144a510616ad83dff5ffea73eb1f50d\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ywlqg0xjnnkd1.jpeg?width=849&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=58564a3077dba973ce1e77be34693229bfd82fe0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zmg7poosyokd1.jpeg?width=4284&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=63e3a0ce05475a648706f8da9e53fa1ec67391ee\n\nso pretty!!\n\nWow!\n\nUmmm, what is that?!?!? That is so rad!!! Do you have these seeds? I will send you money for some.\n\ni got them [here](https://www.rareseeds.com/sunflower-chocolate-cherry)! my fav place to get cool seeds - free shipping in the US \n\nthey show pics of all dark blooms, but if you read the description the seed packet will have various blooms similar to my pictures!\n\nDope on a rope! Cool, thanks!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rlxah7d6snkd1.jpeg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3df2187d42288b1e1c66adc32e8c1046f64b6322\n\nMine have been going wild this week too!\n\nHow tall are those? Looks like 10 meters...\n\nAt least 8ft/2.4 meters! They also look super tall because they’re in a raised bed that is 3ft off the ground.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/djb00ety7nkd1.jpeg?width=4284&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5bc2db4d7d9083f1c6a47f0d1875db7aa8e8fa3c\n\nSince we’re talking bees and sunnies!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qf4fb4zxgnkd1.jpeg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=54effd80c6c4c165239c8088e16f9e2891ee06f7\n\nI have so many napping bees on my sunflowers. I’ve never seen it before, it makes my heart warm.\n\nYa I hope somebody can identify it I’ll def be harvesting seeds for next year this is my favourite so far that I have grown\n\nThey look like strawberry blonde! I know burpee has some. I got mine from Johnny Seeds who also has a plum variety that is pinker\n\nSunflowers thrive on neglect. Spend all of your energy on preparing their bed. Then, plant the seeds and forget about them for best results. \n\nI prepared 2, 12 foot rows and planted the seeds 1 foot apart. I put down weed fabric after they sprouted then went on vacation. My sunflowers grew to about 13 feet tall. We had damaging winds several times, but they just picked themselves back up each time. We get 100f temps regularly and I still only watered them once or twice a week. I like to call them Nature’s Introverts. The more space you give them to do their own thing, the better they thrive.\n\nMy birdseed has begun to grown from being spilled by squirrels and corn began to grow. Was surprised to see that the seeds in my birdseed could grow.\n\nCorn in bird seed is driving me crazy every year I find stocks growing in the most random places from birds dropping corn lol\n\nThat won’t happen for me because birds and squirrels eat my flowers before I can harvest them but I have managed to grow peanuts from birdseed\n\nWell darn I guess I should quit baking bird seed.   “Why bake” you ask, stops it from growing when the seed drops on ground and the ground birds can eat it.\n\nSo gorgeous. I didn’t plant sunflowers and now I have FOMO\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3g21s2jf3qkd1.jpeg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c363adaf4f6e7692d5017f0d4916f588c9630b99\n\nHave to share my beauty!\n\nWhat a beautiful bloom 😍\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bu0m50glpokd1.jpeg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ab58a84072e33345903e56947f8c09f6e8c0a2e6\n\nThis is mine - stunning colour!\n\nThat’s gorgeous\n\nI love it!!!\nI really hope someone identifies it!\n\nThis is easily one of favorite flowers now! 🤩\n\nLooks like strawberry blonde to me, look them up on johnnys seeds!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gteqrlvh5qkd1.jpeg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf6c59c2d31f5e6ef71c4f3c4800ba5f6d3c27e1\n\nHere’s one of mine that’s confused!\n\nI like her, she has a chunky Highlight! 😃\n\nDude save seeds from those. I will gladly buy some off you!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wgvqx240pnkd1.jpeg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8fb33de98e50fca7c4c0c0fd7837339df651e9e8\n\nThis one still hasn’t bloomed, still growing super tall.\n\nAmerican Giant or Russian Mammoth?\n\nMammoth!\n\nI grew some one year that hit the 10ft height and was 15\" across. \n\nThey are amazing sunflowers\n\nThat’s amazing, I’m not sure how tall this is but I’m guessing about 10ft! I can’t find my tape right now ha but I will measure when I do and report back!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jphquj6x6okd1.jpeg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d9d141f521ce03500f19c7c4391d6635b219b3e4\n\nsunnie season :)\n\nI buy sunflower seeds from  American Meadows each year. The trick is to spread some compost and then the seed and water it in. A little sprinkle of compost on top to fool the birds. My seeds all germinate. \n\nI have one about 10 feet tall. This one actually returned from last year. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6xevzz5wcokd1.png?width=503&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=947091894794b22fa64eb99201aa546627217a96\n\nMy problem isn't germination; it's that the local slugs and other creatures apparently think sunflower seedlings are the tastiest thing they've ever heard of 😩\nThey were literally climbing my garden table to get to them!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wg2t2mw5ipkd1.jpeg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=03d299c1da64cff3c52f63b09446e3649e8b8d10\n\nMineee\n\nThanks and I def feel like I did I was expecting just normal yellow ones so this was a bonus for sure\n\nEven the name is awesome! Last year I grew some that where brown and yellow and super tall and I tried those again this year and nothing but then these popped up def my go to for now on\n\nYou got lucky!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pjlwnzz4apkd1.jpeg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0d4d172128ac55d2bc5ae590fddd6dc199a5ba29\n\nBees are very happy\n\nI planted sunflower seeds, and many grew, some 8 feet tall, but the heads were very small, like 3 inches diameter.  Went over to my sisters house and below her bird feeder there is a 4 feet tall sunflower with a MAMMOTH head, it must be 15 inches in diameter.  A short squatty little beauty.  So jealous.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l8xo80ccjqkd1.jpeg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=992f58be0d4d7cf3aa56d9f9c5eaf82e512d9fc3\n\nCan I show off my sunflower? 👀\n\nLove this\n\nGoogle Lens results say Ruby Eclipse for the sunflower variety.\n\nWhatever kind it is, it is absolutely gorgeous!\n\nOoooh that’s beautiful\n\nBEAUTIFUL!\n\nI broadcasted a HUGE bag of bird seed across my yard. We got one sunflower lol I think the birds picked at every other seed\n\nSigh, so beautiful 😍 everytime I try to plant sunflowers something eats them, I will live vicariously through you.\n\nMe, too. Whatever eats the seeds sure likes the sprouts, too!\n\njealous, as deer usually eat mine.\n\nLucky for you so pretty 🌻🌻🌻\n\nThank you! I can’t help but keep walking over to look at it honestly.\n\nThat’s Mother Nature’s magic. My remember my first square foot garden totally full of heads of lettuce 🥬 to me it was like a miracle. And to cut one and make a salad 🥗 was amazing.\n\nThe circle with red tones is truly magnificent. Nature is amazing!\n\nAll I got were these lame sunflowers coming up near my feeders:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gwtkrr6hgpkd1.png?width=1101&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d72d74359661f58344e3285844bf72559fd06e08\n\n  \nAww, who am I kidding? I love 'em anyways. I even love the cute little aphids. But that's probably just because I'm not trying to grow anything they're going to destroy. 😆\n\nI’ve had the same problem! Store bought seeds never worked for me, but now I‘ve had hundreds of sunflower seedlings and dozens of full grown ones all that fell to the ground from my bird feeder lol\n\nYours are absolutely stunning!!!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9bxwfvgp5rkd1.jpeg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fa32a3c009d60c2ebd1b970081e7c3b523e50ec1\n\nOh my gosh, I think I have this variety in my cart for next season.  Eden brothers, the variety is Ruby Eclipse.  So beautiful\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f3aqmybahtkd1.jpeg?width=2268&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=34a33bbc7f1a57f5402a8dbe60673571a24862f9\n\nHere’s mine!\n\nSave the seeds! It’s beautiful!\n\n100% I am and today I noticed this is the first flower but there is 3 more on the way attached to the same stock :)\n\nJackpot!!! I need some of those seeds! I have saved gallons, but mostly the giant yellow mammoth type. I need to start collecting some colors because I’m a huge fan of sunflowers! Guess I’ll be buying some birdseed… 😉\n\nI love sunflower also my first year growing them was a pack of seeds from Cheerios and since then I plant them all over my yard they are just awesome flowers 🌸 and they attract all the pollinators we need for our veggies :)\n\nAbsolutely glorious!   Nature is so cool!!!\n\nAbsolutely stunning!\n\nYou got designer seeds.\n\nMy best sunflowers (almost 2 meters / 6 feet) were the once that I just put in the ground outside together with a flower mix for insects and never looked at again. I've got to add that our area has quite poor quality earth when it comes to nutrients\n\nPossibly Aztec Sun? Though, usually they're  a shade darker.\n\nWOW that’s really beautiful!  Save the seed, put it in the bird feeder, talk nice to the birds and maybe they’ll plant you some more! ;-)\n\nStrikingly beautiful!\n\nBlanket flower. Pretty.\n\nAll of mine come from the bird feeder. I don't think I've bought a seed packet for sunflowers in years.\n\nAll these are beautiful!!!\n\nCan you share what brand of seed you buy? I really want some of these now.\n\nYours look majestic\n\nStrawberry Sunflower seeds…. Very beautiful!\n\nI have a bunch of seed packets I really hope they produce something as beautiful as this because if not I’m gonna cry 😭😭😭\n\nWow! The way the coloring blends looks like a sunrise! ☀️\n\nBeautiful!\n\nI love it!!!  Love sunflowers.\n\nWhat a beauty!!!\n\nIt is beautiful. My favorite flower\n\nSame!! Store bought immediately died, but every patch of bare dirt has bird feeder sunflowers from a chipmunk. 🌻\n\nWow good idea! Thanks!\n\nOh that’s beautiful\n\nBird seeds also contain sometimes industrial grade cannabis\n\nYes beautiful. Mine sprouted but, took forever.\n\nDamn it's perfect\n\nThese are gorgeous! When is the best time to plant sunflower seeds??\n\nI never plant sunflowers in my garden but dozens pop up every year because of the squirrels and the bird feeder next door. Lol\n\nYou planted birdseed?  Were you trying to grow birds?\n\nOmg this is beautiful\n\nBeautiful!!!\n\nSame!\n\nBrilliant!\n\nMine are \nBurpees Strawberry Blonde Sunflowers\n🌻\n\nThese are gorgeous!\n\nThat perfect circle\n\nLast year I had accidental sunflowers from my bird feeder, there were 6ft tall, huge incredible flowers. This year I scattered soooooooooo many store bought sunflower seeds, and I got nothing. I don't know what it is but next year I will be seeding with birdseed lol\n\nLooks like an apricot lemonade cosmo\n\nWhoa. That’s one of the most beautiful sunflowers I’ve ever seen! What a score!\n\nLooking for the bird seed brand if OP has already mentioned it!\n\nLook for strawberry blonde sunflowers from burpee or from Johnny seeds\n\nThank you! I was just more curious about what brand was doing this with their seeds is all. \n\nMy kind of curiosity is the nonsensical kind...\n\nOhh gotcha :) wanted to make sure if you're trying to grow something similar, you know where to find it\n\nIt’s a bird bullseye 🎯\n\nLooks like a Ruby Eclipse.\n\nSomehow all of my successful sunflowers have been from bird seed! This year I only planted those\n\nIt's An amazing sun within a sun\n\nI didn’t plant any sunflowers. The birds did all the work. They are popping up in random places and I love it\n\nI have a sunflower which just bloomed yesterday. It's been a battle all summer long to keep the bunnies and turkeys from eating all my flowers. I planted a few sunflowers and the bunnies made holes through my fencing and ate all my sunflowers except two of them. I bought Mammoth and Velvet Queen sunflower seeds.\n\nGorgeous!\n\nHow much sun per day does a flower like this need?  I have no more than 4 hours anywhere.\n\nMine gets all day sun but I have planted them where they only get the afternoon and they still work out :)\n\nI feel the need to give them a try---such fabulous flowers!   Thanks.\n\nBeautiful"

Probably because I'm 100% certain that a squirrel would eat mine the day I meant to harvest it.\n\nUpdate: best pineapple Ive ever had\n\nWas so juicy that it overflowed the cutting board and made a mess. Worth it\n\nI will be growing another one from this one\n\n[Here is a picture of the inside ](https://imgur.com/a/7lL0j9F)\n\nI've grown one as well! Just a tip so you don't need to wait 7 years for a fruit to form, rotting apples placed in the center of the crown/new growth releases ethelyne gas that triggers flowering within about 5 weeks or so. Managed to get a fruit on a 3 year old plant!\n\nnoted. will try on a 2yr old I have\n\nCan you use this rotting apple trick on any other flowering plants?\n\nSeems to be mainly bromeliads that respond in this way\n\nWhy did I never link pineapples to bromeliads. I have a vivarium with various ones even.\n\nI'd love to see a photo of that!\n\nOMG Thanks for sharing that amazing cross section! Bravo on the patience and the delicious pina.\n\nThat looks like a Honey Gold.\n\nMake sure to save the skin for tepche.\n\nI have 4 plants growing... You gave me hope!!!\n\nFrom experience, it took about four years to get a pineapple to grow. I had four plants planted about a year apart. The others seem to follow the year after the oldest plant produced a pineapple.\n\nI might post a pic. Let me repot it first.😁\n\nOmg!! I hope mine grows to that size! The inside is literally perfect 😍\n\nBe sure to save the seeds, so you can grow the same one. I’ve heard that plants sometimes skip traits per generation or something\n\nI read that they only make seeds when pollinated from a different variety of pineapple. There were no seeds in this one. Im probably the only one in the immediate area that has a pineapple. At least the only one that was flowering at that time\n\nShe’s a beaut!\n\nBeautiful!!! Great job!\n\nHow do ya know when to harvest? I'm sure waiting 7 years that had to be hard to decide when\n\n[deleted]\n\nI will post the next one in 7 years\n\nRemindMe! 7 years.\n\n!remindme 7 years\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x10trpxezhjd1.jpeg?width=706&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5b6e8afaf83183a24ee89cfd3fbc10eaddc20005\n\nI’m sure most of us will be here waiting. 🤣 Congrats on the pineapple!\n\nGoogle search:  \nPineapple plants do not fruit more than once— that is, the mother plant doesn’t fruit again.\n\nGrowing Pineapples From Suckers; A pineapple plant flowers only once, and produces one pineapple. Then it dies. But before it dies it also produces offspring.\n\n… if you leave one or two suckers on it while the fruit is developing, additional fruit will form and be ready for harvest about a year after the initial fruit.\n\nGoogle is wrong. If you got that from Googles AI, then it makes sense. The AI is stupid. I have 20 pineapple plants on my property and get fruit from all of them every year.\n\nI didn’t “Google A.I.” It. I did do a Google search and copied and pasted the info from 2 different websites.\n\nWherever you found it, it's wrong.\n\n!RemindMe 7 years\n\n!remind remindme 7 years\n\nPineappleception.\n\nYay! Persistence paid off with a beautiful prize 😍\n\nWow! I admire your persistance! (I am not that patient)\n\nI’ve been waiting for 5 years for my fig tree (more like a bush) that’s supposed to produce figs after one year. \n\nI can’t figure this plant out. It hates direct sun, partial shade, full shade, heat, cold, too much water, not enough water. Yeesch! \n\nBut I’m still trying! (I’m a glutton for punishment.) 😅\n\nI think it just hates.\n\nTotally Agree.\n\nI have gotten figs! Then we had 0 temps for two years and the figs have been growing funny the last two summers. (They aren’t close to being ripe yet this late in the year) one of my paw paw trees died. I don’t know why. Out of 4 blueberry bushes one did awesome, one didn’t produce at all and the other two produced very little. \n\nMy garden has wilt, stink bugs, squash vine borers, aphids, and despite its 6 foot chain link fence, a bunny, squirrel, a possum -who knows, it eats green bean plants, digs holes and has ate almost every damn tomato from my large, beautiful tomato plant I started from seed. What the jerk doesn’t eat, rots either on the vine or on my kitchen counter. Gardening is glorious, expensive, messy, and heartbreaking! 😂🤬\n\nSurrrre, rub it in about your figs. 😅\n\nI put mine out on a nice sunny (but not too hot) day, and it started to wilt. I gave it a little water and a couple of hours later all the leaves turned yellow and every leaf fell off!\n\nBut yet it wasn’t dead. Eventually the leaves started to grow back and actually grew a little.\n\nBut for 5 years of nurturing it with no return on investment it’s disappointing.\n\nAnd don’t even get me started on my blueberry, blackberry, and raspberry bushes! All I’ll say about those are before the deer ate them down to nubs, the birds took what little they produced. Sigh.\n\nI guess this is what I get for living in the country abutting state game land.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/61jpa0qwhijd1.jpeg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=deae3b63401f53b13e58329490f3da32b43956ce\n\nSay hello to my little friend. (Picture taken off my back deck which thankfully is 6’ up off the ground.) 😅\n\nWhat a drama queen! That is so weird.  🧐 One of figs is in the ground,  and the second what’s the replacement when I thought the first one had died. Now I don’t know where to plant it.\n\nWhen we first moved to Tennessee from California, I asked the plant nursery people what bug had eaten my apple trees. They told me it was likely deer. 🤦‍♀️ My husband caged my fruit trees after that. Can I get two apple trees to bloom at the same time, though? No. The peach is healthy, but then a  frost comes along late and has killed the blooms the last two years. \n\nYour little friend is adorable! You may be fighting a losing battle with the wildlife, but I bet your view  (and yard) is amazing.\n\nMany figs have to be pollinated by species-specific wasps. Maybe there aren't any in your area?\n\nIf I remember correctly I think this fig was supposed to be self pollinating?\n\n***I just went to the website where I bought it and this is what they said about pollination:\n\n“LSU Purple Fig Trees are self-pollinating. You will get fruit with only one plant. However, adding an additional LSU Purple Fig Tree will drastically increase the size of your crop.”\n\nBut I made a decision back when I bought it that I live alone so I didn’t want a ton of figs that’s why I only bought the one tree. I just didn’t expect to not get any figs at all! 😅\n\nEh, it is what it is I guess. Just a good ‘ol houseplant. Lol. But thanks for your candor with this! 😀\n\nGood luck!\n\nThanks! Maybe next year. Hope springs eternal! 😅\n\nIs it in a pot?\n\nYes, An oversized pot to allow for growth (This is the second pot it’s in now.) The pot has drainage holes. As it slowly grows, so does the pot. \n\nI feed it a little water when I dig down 2” with my fingers and it feels dry (Anyway, that’s what the directions say to do.) I even bought a special fertilizer made just for figs that I add per the instructions (or at least I used to, it didn’t like it that much either. Go FIGure. Lol.) \n\nWhen I bought this fig, it said it can be grown in a planter and taken inside in the winter and put in a sunny location and supposedly will produce figs year round. That’s the main reason I bought this type of fig. \n\nMy parents grew a fig tree that was at least 6’ tall in a large planter and had the planter on a a platform with wheels. \n\nThey had it outside in the full sun, heat, rain all summer and pretty much did nothing to it and it flourished. \n\nCome fall they would wrap the tree in (burlap? I don’t remember) and then simply wheeled it into their 3 season-unheated but insulated porch, and every year they got more figs than they could eat! \n\nMine is an “LSU purple fig.”  I believe the LSU is Louisiana State University-the University that developed this type of hardy year round fig producing fig. 🤣\n\nI give my figs a full soaking when it feels dry, which is almost daily, a little water never seems to last.  \n\nI also wrap mine in burlap over winter (outside planted ones)  and the ones in pots, I bring inside after leaf drop. \n\nCan you make a post with pictures of your fig?\n\nUnfortunately I live up on a mountain and figs don’t fair well in -20°f temps so I wouldn’t be able to plant it in the ground. \n\nAbout 10 years ago I had the opportunity to move down to N.C. Where I could’ve grown pretty much anything. \n\nWhat stopped me was my relatives that live down there (lol!) but most of all, it gets freaking hot and humid down there in the summer and they are in hurricane alley. Not to mention the flooding they get. \n\nOne year they had a flood so bad that there was a picture of a local school principal rowing his boat to his school! The school was high enough up (like a story high) that it wasn’t badly effected but there was coffins popping out of the ground and thousands of pigs that drowned! So no thank you. \n\nBut I’m getting older and the cold and damp weather here is effecting me. Now I understand why people move to the dessert. Dry heat. \n\nI get a lot of rain here. I once researched it. Believe it or not my area gets more rain than England! And they are famous for their rain! Lol.\n\nOh well what can you do. Just grin and bear it.\n\nI have many figs in pots, and I get figs regularly.   I'd love to try and help you figure out why you aren't getting any!\n\nThat’s really nice of you to offer, but after 5 years of trying, at this point I just consider it a house plant. 🤣\n\nUsually after first pineapple they will continue to produce every year.\n\nYeah after it tipped over, theres a new center part that looks like it will make another one\n\nI have 20 pineapple plants on my property. They fruit every year.\n\nIt looks like it's gonna be so delicious and sweet. So yellow on the outside! How was it?\n\nI havnt cut it open yet, I will here in a little bit\n\nI got a pineapple this summer too. It was my first and it took five years. It was also absolutely amazing! Now the plant has a new sprout coming out alongside the stem that had the pineapple so I think it may start working on another?\n\nThat’s not at all where I thought they grew…\n\nIt grows like its trying to trick people into thinking thats how it grows\n\nForgot to mention…the top of that will be your next pineapple plant!\n\nThey do much better in ground with a ton of water. We did an experiment and in ground with lots of water produced big sweet fruit in a little under 2 years, in ground with no additional irrigation same time frame but the fruit was really small, and all the plants we have in pots are not fruiting yet, and are various sizes depending on the pot.\n\nI wish I could have it in the ground, but it would never make it through the winter here in 7b\n\nOh, yeah we’re in pineapple country 9b 😁 having less outside time/heat/room to spread out could be why it took so long.\n\nI am 2 years into my pineapple journey and this is both awesome and discouraging lol.\n\nWhat zone are you in? I'm in zone 10a/B, and it only takes mine 2 years from planting the top of a cut pineapple to harvesting the fruit. I grow it in a big pot\n\nI am in 8b/9a along the gulf coast. How big is your pot and what kind? Ive got mine in a 7 gallon bag at the moment trying not to over water it while it was getting established, but ive been meaning to up size it for a while now so happy for suggestions.\n\nDidn't know it could take up to 7 years for the pineapple to grow! How did you keep the plant alive for that long though?\n\nIm in zone 7b so I had been taking it inside for the winter. I finally got a cheap greenhouse last winter and I think thats what really helped this year since the plant was never healthy after spending the winter inside. Plus it was taking up half a room. Other than that I haven't done much, just water and feed it every once and a while.\n\n[deleted]\n\nAs long as it doesn't freeze in there. I had a small electric heater, but Im going to go with a diesel heater this year because the electric heater was driving up the electric bill pretty good. I would water it about once a week or so. Sometimes less\n\nCan't be below frost point. I have mine in a greenhouse in pots, average to fruit is about 3 years from tops/pups and they are smaller, just harvested one actually (Southern hemisphere so I'm in winter currently), amazingly good.\n\nNo supplementary heating this year so it goes to single digits Celsius overnight but no frost or below 0 temps, plus mine are off the ground to help with no sitting in cold air.\n\nEdit: FWIW I'm in the USDA equivalent of Zone 9/9a\n\nCongrats!!\n\n7 years is wild!! \nI love gardening and even have more than 5 pineapple crowns growing. Idk how I feel\n\nThat’s awesome!!! I’m so happy for you and that’s my dream!!\n\nWhat a beauty!\n\nCongratulations 🎊 👏.  You  both deserve it.\n\nYay!!!!\n\nWow!!\n\nWow such a beautiful 🍍 I’m growing one too, I guess been about a year. Long way to go 😮‍💨\n\nHope it was sweet.\n\nENJOY EVERY BITE!\n\nCongrats!!! It’s beautiful\n\nMay this be your best one yet! Congratulations.\n\nBeautiful, and you got it before varmints did!\n\nI was concerned about that after reading some posts about it here. We have a lot of raccoons around here too. I sprayed bondie repels-all around the pot its in and never had anything mess with it\n\nI really want to try this. Do you bring it in during cold weather? Do you feed it?  Not sure I'll be here in 7 years tho 🤔\n\nYeah, Im in zone 7b so it would never survive the winter. I used to bring it inside until I got a small greenhouse. That really helped with getting it to fruit this year. I fed it occasionally when I remembered. Either miracle grow all purpose or fish fertilizer, whichever I had laying around\n\n[deleted]\n\nAs long as it doesn't freeze, it should be fine. It got relatively cold in my greenhouse (upper 30s to 40s) and it was fine\n\nFU MAN\nmy pineapple plant died (by roommate) after 4 years; you lucky turd!!\n\nReminds me of when I got my San Pedro cactus to flower and fruit and seed which is hard as hell to do  in Iowa\n\nBeautiful patience pays off.\n\nOmg congrats\n\nI did one in San Diego and got 2 small one 2 years later. I might have picked them too early but they were sour. Nice job OP!\n\nGo Chaz! I'm in year 7 as well. No pineapple in sight but you have given me hope.\n\nLiving the dream!!!\n\nExciting - it’s gorgeous!\n\nCongratulations!! 💛🍍\n\n👌🥳\n\n7 years!! The plant I buy at my local Walmart in Illinois already has one this size growing on it 😅\n\nI’m always curious how pineapples can be one of the most affordable fruits for the volume at the grocery store despite the plants taking years to fruit and bearing a single pineapple. There’s some economy of scale piece in the growing process I’m missing , but whatever it is it must be significant. \n\nThis gives me such hope.  I've had 1 for at least 4 years that hasn't done it's thing yet\n\nFuck yeah pineapple!\n\nCongrats!!!\n\nI don’t get how I can buy one at the store for $3\n\nNice - I used the rotten apple peel trick and got mine after 2 years. - I'm sure being in pseudo zone 10 helps as well.\n\nThat is a perfect pineapple!  🍍\n\nBeautiful\n\nCongrats! Pineapple is my next challenge once I can get these darn dragonfruit to fruit!\n\nOkay!! So now I know I have another 4 years to go before I can expect one pineapple!! 🍍 You really made me think about my rate of consumption and how I should be grateful and consider it a really rare treat!\n\nI grow about 20 /year, SW FL.  Is yours potted?  That would definitely stunt growth as you are experiencing.  If you are doing that for weather conditions so it can come indoors, I would find the biggest pot you can find, like used for trees here around a pool.  Full sun, every day. If mother nature can't provide, get a grow light (or\ngreenhouse).\n\nI noticed your pot is kinda small. Use the Miracle Grow moisture control soil and mix with granular citrus fertilizer mixed throughout. Cut the mother plant back once your slips grow up large. You can see which ones what to stay on it and which ones want to come off easily. If you leave on until September there should be excellent root growth to start a new plant. Use largest pots you can find with drainage and fill soil 4 inches from the top -dig a hole and press into soil then water extremely well. This should give you another pineapple much quicker than a crown would. The one on the mother that is attached should also give you one too. \nOnce a month dissolve fertilizer in a gallon jug and water them a bit with it. A lot of growers will use a ph meter but I’ve never done this. If you need any tips I’m here! Dm me anytime :)\n\nCongratulations I'm so jealous! I've been waiting for 9.\n\nCongratulations on your achievement\n\nWas it worth it 🤔\n\nFor the minimal amount of effort I put into it, I think it was worth it\n\nCongratulations 7 yrs is a lot of work, well deserved.\n\nNice. I just saw this plant at Trader Joes.  It grows 1 pineapple?\n\nYeah it grows 1 at a time\n\nomg aww look at that little boo boo.\n\nMy pineapple is pregnant!\n\nOooooooooo👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾\n\nDid you have a cool plant for six years or did it just turn into a matter of principle?\n\nthe time will pass anyways u can wait 7 years for no pineapple or 7 years for possibly a pineapple and you got a pineapple!! 🌱🍍\n\nHow big of a pot did you have it in? I’ve been considering growing one but I want to make sure I get the right sized pot for it.\n\nIm not sure the exact size, but its giant. Especially compared to the 7 gallon pots my tomatoes are in. Maybe 20 gallon or so? Not too sure\n\nOh wow! Alright, I’ll go way up in size on the pot! Thanks!\n\nI didn’t go through all the replies, but those telling you you’re going to get other pineapple from this plant are incorrect because a pineapple plant is one and done.\n\nYou might get baby off shoots of the plant that will turn into plants, but your main plant will never produce another pineapple.\n\nAll those YouTubers had me thinking this took a few months 💀\n\nCongratulations on your pineapple! 🍍\n\nThat is a perfect fruit! Congratulations! It is so exciting on harvest day. I bet it smells wonderful.  Enjoyed mine last May in a delicious fruit salad! My first fruit took over ten years until I learned the decaying apple trick!\n\nNice!!! It took me seven years to even get one to propagate.\n\nDid you grow them from store bought pineapple?\n\nYeah it came from one from walmart\n\nWow 7 years. That is amazing. You are one patient person! Any idea how long it will take to grow another one now that it’s at fruiting age?\n\nThere have been a variety of different answers in this comment section about whether or not it will even make another pineapple. Ill just let the plant keep doing its thing and see for myself if it does and how long it takes\n\nKeep that top and pull off some of the bottom leaves and place it in water. Replace the water when it looks nasty.  Keep it there until roots get about two inches long or more.  Then plant it.\n\nThats how I got this plant, I plan to keep making more of them\n\nThey don't normally take 7 years - more like 3 or 4. The op must be in a cold climate.\n\nZone 7b, it spent a lot of time inside and in a pot too small. I moved it to that big pot 3 years ago\n\nI am in 8a and I keep mine outside April to October.\n\nI've gotten quite a few fruit around 4 years.\n\nBut yeah, they have pretty big roots so they need decently large pots. \n\nThere's also a hack where if you think your pineapple is big enough to fruit, you can set a rotten apple inside the pot and it will encourage the pineapple to produce a fruit.\n\nWhat done for u live in? Just wondering if it’s tropical?\n\n7b, I have to take it inside or in the greenhouse for the winter\n\n7b! holy cow! im 7b and i never thought to even bother. and now i will.\n\nYou must not have squirrels\n\nI was telling me wife about how it took me three years to grow a pineapple when I was in elementary school and flat out doesn’t believe me. \n\nCongratulations, but goodness. Seven years is a long time.\n\nCool , I bet it’s so sweet and juicy!! They say growing yourself is better for you and the fruit !!! Post more of your garden VERY interesting\n\nThe rest of my garden is mostly a few jalapeños and some sickly looking tomatoes. Hopefully next year will be more productive. This was my first year growing this many plants\n\nI was told it only takes a few years and was ready to give up on my 2 year old plant!! Thank you for the hope!\n\nIt's been 4 years since I planted mine, still waiting.\n\nBeen tending to mine for a year and waiting 😭\n\nCongratulations 🥂\n\nMine is three.\n\nIs it just me, or seeing how pineapples grow is just weird?\n\nPineapples are one of those things that I'm in awe we have available to us year round.\n\nCut the top off the new one when you pick it and grow another!\n\nThats the plan\n\nI'm trying the same right now so it's encouraging to see your success! Any tips?\n\nIm honestly surprised it worked. My only tips are get the biggest pot possible and keep it in a greenhouse if you can to extend the growing season. Mine used to be in a smaller pot and it stopped growing after a couple years, once I moved it to the big pot it started growing again and doubled or more in size\n\nCongratulationsssssp\n\nCongratulations, it is beautiful\n\nI’ve been growing them for 6 years now and have a small pineapple farm! Now growing the golden queens, sugarloaf and Florida Special varieties. This year I got 12 but last year I had 18. Hoping for a few late bloomers. \nWanted to mention you should put some stakes around yours when they bend like this. They love standing tall:) Enjoy!\n\nAmazing\n\nMy aunt has a bunch of pineapples in her yard. She said it takes about 7 years to grow one. I was shocked when I heard that. But she explained, I just planted a new one every year. And every year she had more pineapples than last year. And now she has so many she doesn’t know what to do with them!\n\nDo they taste different that store bought ones?\n\nIts been 7 years since I've had a store bought one but from what I remember this one was much better than that one\n\nMan....homegrown pineapple, pina like this is the BEST.  So friggin juicy and delicious and acidic but balanced...incredible.  And making tepache from the peels and core is great too.  Using the juice and some fruit as substitute for citrus/acids in ceviche, on rice and beans, in vinaigrettes, on or wish fish, in marinades for meat...okay I'm done.\n\nI miss having pineapple as good as it sounds that one was, congrats OP!\n\nDid it smell good?? We grew a pineapple at one of my old jobs and it made the whole greenhouse smell sooo sweet\n\nI decided to pick it when I walked by the plant and smelled it. The whole house still smells like pineapple, its great\n\nI’ve tried so hard to grow a pineapple 😭 congrats on your success! Any tips? I can’t seem to figure it out.\n\nPut it in the biggest pot you can get and keep it outside as long as you can before it freezes\n\nMine is currently indoors… your success has me questioning that. Did it always live outdoors? Do you use a cold frame in winter?\n\nI keep it outside as long as I can and bring it inside before first frost. I used to keep it in the house, but now I have a greenhouse for it\n\nIf that were me, I’d probably cut it too early LOL\n\nIt takes 7 years to grow a pineapple?!?!?\n\n\"Planted her back in nam\"\n\nNow hang it upside down\n\nI really want to try this now! how did you start it?\n\nI started it from thr cut off top of a regular store bought pineapple. I first had it in a cup of water until it grew roots then I moved it to a pot. Theres some good videos on youtube about doing this\n\nthank you. I'm doing this with my next pineapple\n\nCongrats on the Pineapple \n\nOne just 4 more to go😩\n\nThe plant will produce pups, you’ll get faster pineapples if you plant those out as well.\n\nI got 3 pineapple plants from a friend, planted them at my partner’s place, and 3 or 4 years later I finally got a freakin pineapple! I was so excited but sadly never got to eat it as me and my ex broke up before it ripened 😭\n\nI still make jokes with my friends about stealing back my pineapple plants from his yard one night.\n\n7 yrs of planting?!\n\n7 years caring for the same plant\n\nAwesome! It’s beautiful. I know nothing about growing pineapples because in Maine our climate is not compatible. I’m wondering if pineapple trees are like other fruit/vegetables that take a few years to start developing on the plant? I hope you continue getting pineapples\n\n  , you time , patience is pay off!👍👍\n\n7 years lol. I have 5 to go :(\n\nAt least I'll get one one day. Can't say the same for my compost heap avocado. 4 years in on that one.\n\nMine was about that big when my little brother dropped it and snapped it right off the stem. I was so upset over it I just went in my room and pretty much cried about it.\n\n7 years?!? I just planted mine a couple of months ago and he's a big boy already (no pineapple). Am I really going to have to wait 7 years?! 😅"

Thank you for sharing!\n\nSo good you gotta show em twice :-)\n\nHow in the world does Canada have zone 8 farming?!\n\nA lot of places in Ontario grow peaches as well. Oftentimes in zone 5 areas.\n\nPNW\nI'm in Washington State\nAlso zone 8 😉\n\nWe get mild and very wet weather, for the most part.\n\nMy favorite fact about this is when they place Sequoia trees in the PNW, they grow insanely fast and turn into absolute beasts and grow about 5x faster than they do in the eastern Sierras.  It will be crazy to see what happens to them in 100 years even if I don't get to see it.\n\nAny peach/fruit growing tips that helped you get such a good harvest?? Every time I try my hand at a peach tree it dies faster than an old iPhone\n\nSo we let it grow in a pot until it was a little sturdier, on our deck in a good spot with lots of sun and cover from bad weather.  Good new soil once in the ground, fertilizer (you'd have to ask mum what kind), and boom, tons of beautiful flowers in spring, the bees/pollinators adored them.  Lots of water, especially in the heat. \n\nI really, really hope this isn't a fluke lol.\n\nWas this grown from seed?\n\nDefinitely not.\n\nI find the tree to be awfully close to the house. But if it's what it takes for you to get peaches. Train it in espalier is you can!\n\nIt’s common in that region to grow it against the house, to shelter it from the rain and reduce leaf curl I think.\n\nYeah, Vancouver is like England.. it rains 364 days a year\n\nClose. In England it rains 364 days a year. In Vancouver it rains every day EXCEPT for summer, everything is dry and on fire for 3 months before the rain resumes as per usual\n\nOh yeah.. I forgot about the wild fires 😔\n\nYeah it sucks :( this year fire season has been mild, the air quality has been really good for Vancouver (and Seattle, where I am), even though there’s the usual fires in BC, eastern WA, Oregon, Cali. we’ve been really lucky with the wind patterns and lack of heat waves this summer\n\nI hope it stays good for the rest of the summer. We get the smoke from Alberta fires right here in southern Quebec.. hazy sky on and off these days.\n\nAhhh yeah :( I hope the smoke doesn’t get too thick at least, sometimes haze can actually make days less hot so that can be a tiny silver lining, not to mention gorgeous sunsets. May the rain return as fast as possible so the air can be clean again.\n\nThe half-moon was bright orange Tuesday evening too. We'll get alot of rain here over the weekend, the air will get cleaner. \nI just hope western Canada will get some rain too to help with the fires.\n\nYay rain!!! I know we’re gonna get a bit of rain in Seattle on Saturday/Sunday, Vancouver too. Not a lot but every little bit helps I suppose. Another month and the usual rain should be back!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ycfhg9mbn1jd1.jpeg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=362468ea624e6f5003fd8ed5cad354087a374f7c\n\nSorry for the mediocre picture quality, this was this morning sunrise with the smoke smog.\n\nBeautiful! But unfortunately not healthy :( a few days ago the sun looked a bit like this when it was setting but it was definitely less hazy and the air quality was still pretty decent\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/51gnz9h382jd1.jpeg?width=1242&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=946d1a60bbdb4e09343b4ba9cba1cb6096d5e987\n\nYou also get a lot of radiant heat from the side of the house, because it's not an area with warm summers.  My grandpa's peaches are still the best I've ever tasted in my life, they grew the size of your head right up against the side of his house in Victoria, BC.\n\nYes, it came to us already in espalier style, that's the only reason it's so close to the house.\n\nThat's great! Everything will have access to  the sun. I'm so jealous, I don't think I'd be able to get many peaches in my zone.\n\nI believe I’m in 4b (Minneapolis, MN) and I have a successful Contender peach tree. We used to get 20-25 per year until the squirrels figured out they were there. The biggest surprise to me was how good a cold hardy variety still tastes.\n\nPeach and apple trees have relatively weak root systems, so they don't tend to cause foundation damage or any of the issues you would get if you planted, say, a red maple tree that close to your house.\n\nThat's good to know\n\nThat’s it..I’m getting a peach tree.\n\nDo it!!\n\nSerious question here, how do you keep the squirrels from eating them?? I have a peach tree that every year is full and I’ve never been able to harvest a single one because the squirrels eat it bare long before they are big enough to pick.\n\nMy grandpa sat outside with a BB gun\n\nI shot a squirrel with a BB gun once when i was like 13 just trying to scare it away. It instantly paralyzed the poor thing and its friend came and looked at it from the top of the fence for a long time as he died. I was devastated. That was almost 30 years ago and that guilt still feels fresh when the memory bubbles up every so often. Shooting an animal you don't intend to kill or are willing to eat is just the worst feeling.\n\nHe had cataracts so I don’t think he ever hit anything. Your story really touched me though, I’m sorry about that squirrel\n\nAwww no lol i wasn't talking about gramps. It just brought back that memory for me. Some vermin do gotta get shot, its just part of life especially back then. \n\nThis particular victim was guilty of nothing more than raiding the bird feeder a couple times. If it was an animal that was actually destroying stuff and couldn't be realistically caught or deterred then i wouldn't have felt so bad. \n\nThe terrible part is i was aiming for his fat little ass and hit his neck accidentally.\n\nSame here and it was more than 50 years ago!!  We all stood around and cried.\n\n😭 I guess I’m never having peaches.\n\nOutdoor cats work too. Or some types of dogs. Or a hawk. Or even just the occasional Pringles can trap can typically scare them off for a summer or two.\n\n&gt; Outdoor cats work too.\n\nThey'll kill a lot more than just squirrels, but this is a great solution if you hate all life smaller than a cat!\n\nI have mixed feelings about outdoor cats. I *despise* rodents and the property damage they can cause, and most things a cat will kill can also damage garden produce too. On the other hand, it's rare to have an outdoor cat that won't go out and hunt at night outside of your yard, which can definitely hurt songbird populations.\n\nThat said, you don't need to let a cat out every night for squirrels to figure it out. If I could have an outdoor car (and had one that would leave our chickens alone) I definitely would, at least during gardening months.\n\nI have two pitbulls and a family of hawks that lives right in my yard. The squirrels are still savage. I haven’t tried this pringles can thing you speak of though 🤔\n\n&gt; I haven’t tried this pringles can thing you speak of though 🤔\n\nBuy a can of Pringles. Eat the chips out of it. Hole punch a hole in each side at the top. Run string/top through it, and tie off the end far enough away from the can opening that when laid on the ground, the squirrel/chipmunk can still get into the can (eg, enough slack that the line isn't tight). Take the other end of the string and run it up through the small gap between the pieces of a picnic table. Lay the can on the ground under the table, and lay out a line of bait to/into the can. Sit in a chair a ways off (holding the line of string/rope). Wait.  Once the target approaches, don't do anything. Once it's all the way inside the can, yank the string. The can will lift up off the ground and the rodent will be trapped in the can, with the underside of the picnic table acting to block the exit. The squirrel will freak and claw madly, and once released, likely won't return to the yard for a while. I had a scout master so this at camp and by the end of the week, none of the squirrels/chipmunks would come near the campsite.\n\nNow I need a bigger version for raccoons and deer\n\nOh wow, I need to try this. Thanks!\n\nMy aunt planted a fig tree on the other side of the yard.  \n\nShe hates figs but once heard that squirrels would choose them over the peaches since they can do a grab n dash with the figs a bit easier.  \n\nIt seemed to work because the squirrels didn't touch the peaches or plumbs. \n\nUnfortunately fig trees do NOT protect against a dump truck driver backing into the yard (renovations) without looking.\n\nMaybe we have super squirrels or something. They just sit and hang out in the tree and go to town. They don’t seem to be afraid of me approaching them, my dogs, nothing. I did have a fig tree (small), that has produced some fruit, but it somehow died off in our warm winter last year. I am chalking that up to the VERY aggressive deer we have. I have a lemon fig growing from a cutting in a pot on my porch which will go in the ground at some point. However, I am trying to save up for a very high perimeter fence to keep out the deer before I do anymore planting. One step at a time…\n\nThe squirrels laugh at my dog.  Laugh in his face, while they eat my... everything.\n\nI am totally jealous. LOVE peaches. Good for you guys enjoy !!!\n\nWow, those are gorgeous. Happy eating!!\n\n[Millions of peaches, peaches for me!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GCrzjVdmSg)\n\nPeaches come in a can they were put there by a man in a factory down towwwwwwnnnnnnnn.....🎶\n\nI just planted a peach tree this year.  It’s a tiny thing for now, but looking forward to harvests in future years. :)\n\nI love that Little Rock bed you have there everything looks very lush\n\nStunning!!!\n\nPeach-perfect!\n\nHow much pest management did you have to do?  I always hear that peach trees need a daily shower of pesticides\n\nEdit: pest, not peat\n\nNone, we are super fortunate so far.  Usually we just do dish soap spray when needed, buy Buddy hasn't needed anything!\n\nPrune it way way back this winter so branches won't break from the weight of fruit next year.\n\nThis!\n\nReally nice, you have to watch peach trees they will overload themselves with fruit.  We had a peach tree that actually split in half with the weight of all the fruit.\n\nWow, I had no idea Vancouver got up to 8b, but looks like it does even some 9b there on the coast. https://www.plantmaps.com/interactive-british-columbia-plant-zone-hardiness-map.php\n\nPretty wild. Parts of central Florida are 9b.\n\nIt's a bit deceiving.\n\n\nThe PNW coast doesn't get very cold, so it ends up much a very high hardiness rating.\n\n\nHowever, many plants who could grow in Florida wouldn't grow in the PNW. It doesn't get enough sun to support many sub-tropical plants or it doesn't get hot long enough for any fruits/flowers to produce. \n\n\nFor example, figs and pomegranates. Both would survive in Seattle but unless you get early varieties, the figs and pomegranates won't have enough time to develop properly in the summer. \n\nPacific Ocean, baby.  Lots of Seattle as well.\n\nMillions of peaches, peaches for me 🎶\nMillions of peaches, peaches for free 🎶\n\n## LOOK OUT\n\n👍🏻\n\nawesome!\n\nTake that, peaches!\n\nWow this is inspiring! I just got a peach seed from my friend’s yard that I plan to growing too! Love those colors, and the garden it’s growing in is gorgeous.\n\nThose peaches look picture perfect, too!\n\nCongrats!\n\nWhat a good little 🌳\n\nDang, my tree must be twice that size and it's never grown an edible peach\n\nThe one in my parents yard is probably close to 8 feet and drops half ripened peaches every year\n\nPrune some of the buds next year, it might do better.\n\nWhen? before they flower?\n\nOr, take off some of the peaches when they are small.  Quite frequently peaches form on both sides of the limb, so remove at least one of those peaches.  It’s heartbreaking, but necessary.\n\nThis made a huge difference for me! I'm also 8b, in Seattle, and also on the peach tree learning curve. I've had success with waiting to thin until the fruits are between dime and quarter size, so you can see which ones are thriving. Then, first thin any scraggly ones that didn't pollinate correctly.  Second, thin any pairs/trios. You don't want the fruit to touch when it ripens, so thin out the smaller of the set. Third, if you still have fruit, thin any that are closer than a hand's width apart.\n\nYour tree can only ripen and support so many peaches, so you'll have a better harvest if you give the tree a chance to direct its resources to fewer peaches, rather than trying and failing to ripen all of them. It is sad to have to cull them though, but worth it in the end.\n\nWow congratulations on your crop! Be sure to read about how to prune your tree to ensure good growth in future years! \n\nI’m in central MO and everyone in my area lost our peaches this year. Our February was gorgeous, Valentine’s Day was 75 degrees. Then in late March we got a hard frost and everyone in the region lost their peach crop. Oh well better luck next year.\n\nI’m in Seattle, can you drive over here and give me some peaches, it’s only like a 3 hour drive 🥺 /j\n\nOkay but these look PHENOMENAL I can smell them through the screen. I’ve had like one good peach this year, the peaches at the store all suck, no matter where they were grown. Many local fruits/veg I’ve bought this summer have been iffy. None of the tomatoes in my garden are ripening. This summer has just been weird for PNW produce I think, maybe that’s just me though\n\nGlad you’ve hit the jackpot with these gorgeous peaches, enjoy!!! \n\n\n…now I want a peach tree. I wouldn’t dare get another fruit tree after my mom’s potted apple tree disasters when I was a kid, and we only plant in pots/raised beds, but… peach tree…\n\nI feel your pain about tasteless store bought peaches. I got two boxes of peaches from Harry and David last week. They are delicious! I wonder if I can grow trees from the pits… 🤔\n\nHmm. You might be able to grow them from the pits! Though I think it depends on the variety, I know for a lot of fruit, seeds you get from them will either not grow or they’ll grow into something else, possibly inedible, due to the fruit not being an heirloom variety. My mom once grew a lemon tree from seed, and let’s just say that tree was nothing like the mini lemon trees for container gardening at the nursery. Same with all the random pumpkin/squash plants that grow in our garden from seeds we collected. Last year we got some cute ornamental pumpkins by accident. Honestly I find it very interesting to experiment and see what grows, so it doesn’t hurt to try :)\n\nThank you! I know very little about gardening but am trying to learn. I live in the Great Smoky Mountains of NC, and I’m not sure it’s the best area for these peaches I bought. I am inspired by the OP’s planting close to the house, though!\n\nI’m quite new to gardening too, I mean I’ve been gardening since I was a kid but it was just helping my grandma. My experience is pretty limited to pumpkins and squash and tomatoes (not grown from seed), but I’ve been experimenting and learning as an adult :) this year I actually grew some tomatoes from seed which was neat. There’s so much to learn and such a wealth of resources online, and people have figured out how to grow “standard” varieties of crops in extreme climate regions where not much can typically grow, so when there is a will, there is (usually) a way. Trying to plant closer to the house as shelter from extreme elements is a great place to start\n\nThat’s awesome, how big was the tree when you got it?\n\nSame experience here. Planted one this winter and had close to a hundred peaches from a small tree. I plan on planting another few this fall since they grow so well in my backyard.\n\njealous!! and they’re gorgeous too\n\nNice! Once it becomes larger you could always use any bruised/ugly fruit for making peach wine, it's pretty easy.\n\n I've been meaning to try this! Do you have a good recipe for fruit wine?\n\nYes. It depends on what your goal is. Just fruit juice wine is less efficient but it will provide a much more peachy result. I would probably go with something like 4-5 lbs of peaches per gallon and add 1 lb of honey to the must. Just freeze and blend the peaches with the skins (no pits) and dump that plus the honey in the fermenter of your choice (I like a food safe 5 gallon plastic bucket with an airlock). Then add water to 1 gallon and stir. \n\nObviously I would make a larger batch, probably up to 4.5 gallons in a 5 gallon bucket (you need to leave air space to allow the fermentation to happen without pushing alcohol out of the top of your fermenter, think bread rising too high out of the pan.) Once you have mixed up the must, dump some yeast on top. You can use bread yeast but I recommend lalvin ec1118. It's a dry champagne style yeast that rarely stalls and has served me well on fruit wines. \n\nIf you really want to be accurate you can use a hydrometer to measure your starting and ending gravity to calculate your exact ABV, but using this recipe you will make a wine that is about 6-8% abv depending on how much sugar is in your peaches. If you go the all fruit route I would still freeze and blend the peaches and then I would add pectic enzyme to help the fruit break down (you can buy it on Amazon or at any brewing supply store or online brew shop). Then you just add the yeast and allow it to ferment. I can't tell you what abv you will get with an all fruit wine because it depends on the sugar and water content of your specific fruit. \n\nOnce it has fully fermented (no more bubbles in the airlock, hydrometer reads no more residual sugars)  you can bottle it and enjoy. I like to put mine in swing top bottles because I don't have to worry about corking or capping.\n\nThanks for the detailed explanation! That sounds much easier than I'd assumed, so I'll have to give that a try. My peach tree doesn't reliably produce enough fruit to achieve the volume you're talking about, but I have a plum tree that can produce over 70 pounds of plums in a good year. My goal is mostly to use up or preserve my fruit before it goes bad, but canning in hot weather isn't my favorite, so wine may be the next project. Thanks!\n\nPlum wine can be really good too 😋\n\nThat looks soo delicious. What zone are you in? \n\nI want to attempt fruit trees next year zone 7..but it has to be in a planter and wintering will be just covering it up outside. Challenging prospect but...\n\nBeautiful 😍\n\nabsolutely beautiful!! they look so delicious omg😵🍑\n\nThose peaches are so pretty they almost look fake!!\n\nLucky and sooo gorgeous!!!\n\nNice tree\n\nCongrats! 😍\n\nLove this for you.\n\nDozens of peaches, peaches for you.\n\nOmg this is so wholesome\n\nThis is so freaking cool\n\nWhat an impressive haul from such a small tree!\n\nI can taste them now! Peach juice running down my chin. Happily!\n\nalright thats it im planting my own peach tree\n\nWow all I do is watch the squirrels knock down every peach and pear before they're ripe\n\nGood haul - enjoy them!\n\noh my goodness!!!!!!!\n\nWow, that's insane for only being in for a year! They look beautiful too!\n\nWhat area/growing zone?  Those look super healthy!\n\nMy oldest peach is 6 years old and still no peaches, I'm jealous!\n\nWhat joy!\n\nReally nice looking peaches.\n\nPeaches look amazing! Well done, peach tree and you of course :)\n\nIt's a bit frustrating that I can be in a place where the high is in the high 90s (and humid) almost every day in the summer, and be in a zone lower than you. \n\nThe Midwest is so mean lol\n\n❤️ I can only dream about peaches. I love them, but I'm allergic...\n\nYum-yum, so much goodness there!\n\nCongratulations, much joy to you :)\n\nThat is amazing!\n\nDamn those look like the worlds tastiest peaches I cannot lie\n\nWow!!! These look lovely! Do you bake or will you just enjoy them as is?\n\nHow do peaches do in cold?\n\nPicture perfect.\n\nLucky you don’t have pests like we do. We have to harvest ours early and small then let them ripen.\n\nThose are BEAUTIFUL! We planted a peach tree this year and I can’t wait for results like this!\n\nThey are beautiful too!\n\nlooks so goood!\n\nBeautiful\n\nSo beautiful…congratulations ♥️♥️♥️\n\nAt least someone had some BC peaches this year 😭\n\nThis gives me hope. I planted one a few months ago in my front yard. I hope I too get peaches in the spring!\n\nThose are some beauties!\n\nJust wait until the squirrels find out about your bounty. Then it will their bounty.\n\nYou can grow peaches anywhere in Canada\n\nAMAZING!! so much from a SMOL bb!!\n\nI really like your peaches, wanna shake your tree.\n\nOmg, they are gorgeous!\n\nAnd they’re absolutely gorgeous 😻\n\nThey are beauties!🍑\n\nwow those look good!!\n\nWhere did you get this tree?\n\nThey are beautiful🥹\n\nWhat variety is this?\n\nHow did yall\nKeep it alive during winter and spring frosts?\n\nthose look delicious 🤤\n\nThey look great! The chipmunks and earwigs ate mine before I could pick them.\n\nVancouver?!?! No way! Screw it, new garden goal: get a peach tree.\n\nThey’re beautiful!!\n\nMillions of peaches, peaches for free? 😁\n\nWhat side of the house is this? As in like N, S, E or W?\n\nThey're Mackinaw peaches Jerry!\n\nNo pretty picture of the peaches growing? Looks yummy. 😋 What variety?\n\nThose peaches look *better* than what you'll find at the store. Congratulations on the success! They look awesome.\n\nThese are lovely!\n\nCongratulations! They’re beautiful!!🍑\n\nGlorious! You have one happy little tree!\n\nSo nice! I’m on my second year with my tree from Lowe’s. Only 2 peaches last year and it was like 3 feet. This year the tree is really tall and produced lots of fruit BUT most of them stayed small and green. I would say only like 5 were eatable. And they didn’t look as pretty and big as yours. Crossing my fingers for next year!\n\nGreat, now plant more with the seeds!\n\nDeets! What you do? 🤩🎉🖖🥳🤗🥰🤔\n\nCongratulations on getting them before the critters did!! They look amazing\n\nNice I just air layered my first peach tree clone this year…. If your looking for more trees I suggest trying it while the tree is young in the spring. \n\nYour tree is still small enough you could probably have a second fully grown tree by the end of next year. If you placed the ball 1/3 of the way up one of the longer/taller limbs\n\nYour peaches look fantastic and yummy! \n\nI just got finished making a peach pie and peach scones! I love peach season!\n\nI guess you don’t have squirrels!!!\n\nAround what time of year is the best time to plant a peach tree?\n\nThey look amazing!! Good haul, friend. I'm so glad they're all you wanted them to be.\n\nHope they continue to be that good looking, too! 🤤\n\nI am very jealous. I can go to town on peaches and nectarines. My favorite fruits.\n\nBeautiful ones, too\n\nThis gives me hope. I’m in 8b as well and wanted to get a peach tree.\n\nwhat i would do to have this myself ahhh\n\nNice!!!!\n\nI would literally squeal!\n\nLove it. Mine was that size about year 3 after planting. We average about 10 gallons of peaches a year.\n\nThis year is insane though. It’s  almost crushing itself\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qgwbq1hxw3jd1.jpeg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4b168e6b56c025a86aa8ff62fe667c13a7ac41c1\n\nI'm so jealous, the squirrels keep getting mine 😔\n\nAnd they are beautiful!!!\n\nLucky you!  They look yummy. Peach pie anyone?\n\nThey look delicious\n\nFrom that tree?! Really?\n\nYum\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/02a2xpgztxid1.jpeg?width=1348&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e74f66e726a7abf05b3f7d09784b41d3724bfe4"

She was a lady in her 70s, you could often see her on the street below pruning, fixing, combing the leaves with super long tools, sometimes standing on a small ladder.\n\nShe used to water in the middle of the night or early in the morning, waking me up with a small waterfall. The balcony was ALWAYS perfect, even in winter. It was fun to constantly see people stopping by and taking pictures; it was like the star of the street. \n\nAs far as I know, she's being curating this balcony for 20 years. She only stopped with length because the guy below her complained about the obscured window, lol.\n\nAnd you got the best of the view\n\nyes! she was often on the street below planning her next move, and I bet it was beautiful even from inside, but a balcony like this is a beautiful gift for everyone too (:\n\nDid you ever talk to her?\n\nI'd want to know how this started. Coolest thing I've seen on here in a minute!\n\nI never talked to her (she didn't seem to like attention on her personally very much) but when we moved out we left a thank you note on her car (:\n\nMy husband and I are moving to Italy soon, and our apartment has a small terrace. This is my goal.\n\nso cool! benvenuti! what area did you pick? (:\n\nWe'll be in Lucca 😊\n\naah, great choice! perfect combo for food &amp; landscapes! tuscan hills are something else (: I wish you the best!\n\nI was just lurking on this sub and read this, I don't live in Lucca but I sometimes go there just walking through the city and chilling, it's - at least from an esthetic perspective - wonderful :) \n\nMagical\n\nLegend\n\nI want to be her.\n\nWow that's so beautiful thank you for sharing. Do you have any pictures of it in the winter? I'd love to see what it looked like\n\nVery green and clean.\n\nThat balcony is spectacular. I agree with you the little window box is the same apartment. But you know there's something to watering at night. I used to get out and soak my beds in the dark. I had cracker Jack marigolds that grew up to the rain gutter on the roof. They're only supposed to make twenty four inches. Blame it on the moon.\n\n*New goal: move to Italy*\n\nYou were so lucky to have seen this beautiful balcony garden\n\n[deleted]\n\nIt is 100% reasonable to want to see out your window\n\nCan you share the address? I'm near Milan\n\nGuys like him are why we can't have nice things.\n\nI mean if my only window was blocked, by plants so my own plants couldn't get natural light I'd be bummed as well.\n\nI get that. I have a little house in my yard that was once someone's fanciful chicken coop. It is now covered in ivy so I cut out around the windows and door. Doesn't hurt the ivy a bit and I only have to do it every couple of years, She could have done something like that. I wonder if she offered to?\n\nWeird how you only thought of this hypothetical only after you labelled him a Karen with 0 context.\n\nBro, a lot of people in Europe don't even have a yard. Balcony is all they get, if that.\n\nMy previous apartment had just two windows in the living room and barely got any light, and it would be upsetting too if those two windows got covered.\n\nHow dare he want sunlight in his own home?\n\nGirls like her are why guys like him can't see out of windows like that.\n\nMother Earth lives there! This is the most stunning balcony garden I've seen. I can see how the Hanging Gardens of Babylon could have existed.\n\nI was gonna say this lady didn't have two green thumbs, she was full blown Mother Earth / Gaia incarnate. I have never seen something so beautiful such as this. That is what I want my house to look like eventually. Amazing!\n\nMine too! It's breathtaking. Makes my soul happy. I imagine her being so attentive and whispering to them to grow.\n\nI strive to be this lady\n\nThis is Disney princess forgets how to be inconspicuous levels of amazing!  \n\nLove to know the nutrients she is using. That box must be tiny compared to all the growth. Such little soil must be getting fertilized often. She should be sponsored by whatever company she is using and be their spokesperson.\n\nProbably composting from food scraps too . Cooking culture in Milan… 🤌🏼\n\nWhere do she do that, the back 10 acres?\n\nLol you don't need acres for a compost bin\n\nNo, but you need more than a 40 sq ft balcony.\n\nProbably a compost tea or something similar\n\nYea! Aside from jokes, who has more experience in growing in little amount of soil can share some advice? Is it a matter of high amount of fertilizer? (I remember that too much it s not good because it can kill the plants too, makes their environment too “salty”)\n\n&gt;who has more experience in growing in little amount of soil can share some advice? Is it a matter of high amount of fertilizer?\n\nThe problem with (small) pots is that the soil dries and gets depleted very quickly, especially when the pot is outside under the raging sun.\n\nI have lots of plants on my balcony, and an automatic watering system is a must. My balcony faces south, and when it's 40°C outside I set it to twice a day, 20 minutes each. The hard thing is setting it up properly so each plant gets the water it needs (different pot sizes make it really hard, the drippers can be adjusted but adjusting one changes the pressure on the whole system, so it feels like a game if whack-a-mole).\n\nI also fertilize (with an organic humus and guano tea) once a week per the label.\n\nPot size limits how big and beautiful the plants can get. As a mental exercise, the roots should be as big as the visible part of the plant.\n\nYou can get gorgeous plants on pots, it's not hard, but it will require time (I feel like more so than a regular garden).\n\nI loved my south facing yard, but it was unforgivable on my plants. So so so much water needed all the time. Currently have a balcony facing east, things don't fry so quickly.\n\nI’m still trying to keep my basil plant alive so I can’t help here.\n\nI think the issue is my cat attacking it tho.\n\nA masterpiece. She’s an artist.\n\nImagine what kind of world we would have if everyone planted what they could with the space they had.\n\nThe same thought crosses my mind often. Especially in urban environments where people have made conscious, often costly, choices to pave over areas that could be planted or left wild.\n\nHow the hell do you even water something like this?\n\nwith a hose, in the middle of the night, and making sure to make as much noise as possible :D I got used to it quickly, no hard feelings\n\nThat’s so funny, I feel like I’d be kicked out of any apartment I’ve ever lived in for excessive water if I did that, but worth it for that beaut!\n\nI think everyone just accepted it because it's so awesome, she's an old lady and it's been there for 20 years, otherwise yes, you'd be at least called out. let her cook!\n\nIn the middle of the night; 3 hours before sunrise is the absolute perfect time to water your garden. It’s peak time. That’s why it looks like this.\n\nIs this a ploy from BigAlarmClock to get us waking up very early? Because I’ll do it. Don’t tempt me. \n\nI didn't know that! she definitely did tho :D I love my many houseplants, but I know very little about gardening - could you explain why is that the best time? because water has time to do its thing before the sun starts evaporation?\n\nIt is peak coolest part of the 'day' ensuring less water evaporation so water gets to the roots. Watering during the day is the worst. You can kill your plants watering in the afternoon.\n\nI’m in awe🫢\n\nAnybody know the names of the plants here?\n\nI am seeing petunia right in the middle. Carnation bottom middle, hydrangea spotted throughout, and English ivy.\n\nThank you!\n\nLooks like Creeping Jenny on the bottom\n\nAgreed!\n\nShe single?\n\nI see Jasmine growing, small vining white flowers.  The night blooming jasmine is also beautiful and the scent is wonderful in the evening.\n\nCame to say I found this balcony online as the plants hadn't been as big as in that picture yet! [https://www.pierocruciatti.com/image/I00007eigEz6OVdM](https://www.pierocruciatti.com/image/I00007eigEz6OVdM)\n\nLife goals right here\n\nMagical!💕🌸\n\nWow this is such a fantastic view.😍 Europe has amazing window gardens.\n\nThat's fuckin dope.\n\nOmg these are beautiful. I lived under someone with a balcony like this, but unfortunately he did not put anything down to stop the dirt, mud, and water from pouring down between the balcony cracks &amp; onto us we sat on ours. We just gave up and stopped going out there or trying to clean it up. He had been there for like 20 years and certainly wasn’t gonna stop because of us lol.\n\nCould you not go up and offer to help put something down so you could both enjoy the outside?\n\nI never say this, but: goals\n\nIt looks like a happy elephant 💕\n\nThe arrangement of the plants are just perfect, that's some beautifully planned work.\n\nPeople like this should be protected at all costs, look how pretty she made the world\n\nProtected, and encouraged to share their craft with youth\n\nParadise found!\n\nThis is so beautiful. I can only hope to have something like this someday, and the skills to take care of it.\n\nWow thank you for showing me this. Amazing 😍🌱\n\nThis is a gorgeous photo you should blow it up and put it in a frame\n\nThis has to be Italy right?!🤔\n\nMilan!\n\nThis validates my nighttime watering lol\n\nFew years ago I lived in a trailer park in Ohio and came out one day to find the trailer park supervisor taking a tape measure to my neighbors flowers. Threatening this ancient old woman with nothing else in the world but her god dam flowers, because they were too tall. They were maybe 3'. This lady has an entire forest on her balcony, ain't no way that would be allowed here.\n\nthat's crazy! I never heard of something like that, here's is pretty common to see very wild gardens and stuff. mostly by homeowners though, not people on rent\n\nThose parks have some absolutely asinine rules. I hate they're allowed to do it, but whatever. I'm thankful AF my partner can afford a house not in an HOA.\n\nIs this in France? Portugal maybe?\n\nI thought I had put it in the title, I didn't! It's in Milan, Italy.\n\nWow! 🤩\n\nAmazingggg\n\nLove\n\nI like her!\n\nStunning!!!\n\nThis lady has a can-do attitude. Imagine if every street had someone like this! I've adopted a tiny piece of municipal land in an ocean of parking spaces and have been working so very hard to improve the soil to the point where I now have several perenials surviving winter. Now there are more people flipping the tiles in their front yard and turning them into tiny city gardens.\n\nFor all the English Ivy haters out there, this is what English Ivy is for.\nAnd God bless that sweet lady for adding some joy to the world.\n\nWhat’s the name of this plant?\n\nAmazing! Thanks for sharing!\n\nSpectacular view! What a lovely story, too.  Thanks for sharing.\n\nStunning. Thank you for sharing. 🌿🌺🍀\n\ni love her\n\nWe lived in Germany for a time and it was always amazing to see where people would stick these whimsical little gardens in their city living. This is amazing. Thank you for sharing!\n\nGorgeous 🤩\n\nthanks for sharing. it's mesmerazing like an oasis in the middle of the desert.   \n\n\ni would love to see the build now, on google streetview. can you tell us the address? or post a screen capture?\n\nHere, the city inspector would have demanded it be cut WAY back before it got remotely close to being that lush.\n\nSo does anyone know what vine/bush is that one clombing the wall?\n\nAmazing! She must have spent much of her time on this gorgeous balcony and I can't get a few plants right!\n\nYeah.. her aura is beautiful\n\nDid you return the favour and enhance 'her' view?\n\nwe had a couple of unfortunate looking plants that belonged to the landlord ): we weren't supposed to stay for a long time so we never tried more\n\nSpectacular! When I lived in a first-floor apartment in Manhattan, I had a large window box that I would plant every year. One summer I was particularly lucky with my pink petunias, vinca, and moon glories, and came home one day to see a small group of Japanese tourists snapping pictures of it! With sign language, I indicated that the window box was mine, and they insisted on taking my picture with the flowers. So sweet! The point is, it is so gratifying to know a little work and love gives others so much pleasure. If you get a chance to let someone know you got pleasure from someone’s garden, no matter how small, it’s appreciated.\n\nThanks, now we are all going to have her balcony in our heads.\n\nWhat did she feed those😳😳\n\nLove this photo and the story.\n\nHow??!!!\n\nWow, magnificent\n\nIt looks like a beautiful gown . Absolutely stunning.\n\nWow how is this possible!? She must have had some kind of platform to grow all that! Amazing!!\n\nI’m pretty sure I’ve seen this on Pinterest and Google!\n\nIf it’s not too much to ask, can you tell me which neighbourhood this window is at? I’m in Milan for few more days, would really love to have a look at this beauty\n\nI'll DM you (:\n\nThis is the look I looooove!! I strive to be this lady!! I live in an apartment but I've been blessed with the landlord allowing me a mini garden and my neighbor giving me reign over our shared patio and I would LOVE to have it this fluffy, green, and floral.... problem is the next door neighbors trees block so much of my sun it's absolutely devastating\n\nDo you happen to have any photos with more vertical height? This is beautiful.\n\nI might, but I don't remember where I saved them /:\n\nNo worries! This is just such a stunning balcony. Thank you for sharing!\n\nThis is the goal for my balcony but I fail every year.\n\nI love her\n\nold white dads everywhere are getting flustered\n\nSo wish I could see it from her balcony's perspective.\n\nYou’re thinking about it right now, in fact.\n\nThis is stunning\n\nNow I’m gonna think about it\n\nWe need more information. What was she using on them?\n\nYou lived across from a witch, a very lovely beautiful soul of a witch, who knows how to work her magic on some plants. Take my advice, bring her food and ask her questions.\n\nCan someone identify the plants here and list them? Curious if any of them grow here in the US in zone 9\n\nThat is magnificent.\n\nWow. Gorgeous. Imagine if stuff like this was everywhere. It would look like paradise.\n\nIf she didn't come out every morning and evening and sing a beautiful aria then this was all for naught!\n\nWonderful\n\nI’m going to Lucca in July!

    "body": "I had just finished typing a detailed post when I accidentally blew it all away. :’)\n\nThe jist was, has anyone grown these guys from seed and would you share your experience? All the conflicting information online could give a girl whiplash, lol. The most appealing approach I’ve seen is to not over complicate it, just keep it moist. I need about 9-12 trees in total for my aquariums (the photo is not mine but just an example of what I’m recreating), approximately how many seeds should I order?\n\nMy plan of attack thus far is a seedling tray, humidity lid, perlite only as substrate, drainage pan filled with hydroponic fertilizer and a heat mat below it all.\n\nThanks for your time.\n",

    "all_comment_text": "If you want up to 12 trees, I would suggest sowing 2 or 3 times more. Then, you can have failures and as the successful ones grow you can weed out the weaker trees and end up with the strongest ones\n\nThank you for the feedback, I’ll go ahead with your suggestion. Better too many than not enough, eh? :)\n\nIf I have any surplus seedlings I’ll hold onto them an additional year or so, begin bonsai on them (the natural tall/narrow growth pattern isn’t sustainable for this application, not to mention indoors at all lol) and then sell them on to other aquascapers. More money to put back into my hobbies!\n\nYes, certainly. You can sell on our have back ups if something was to happen to your 12 picked trees.\n\nLooks like they aren't meant to ever come out of the fishtank, so while this is usually great advice, it's not really relevant in this scenario.\n\ngood idea 👍\n\nI absolutely love this. It's so cool.\n\nThe aquarium setup is the coolest thing I've seen in a long time!  Hope you can share progress picks for your own version.\n\nI’ll make sure to come back and link progression photos and once completed. :)\n\nI agree! I love it.\n\nI grow a batch every year here in coastal VA. I collect several cones when they are brown on the trees. They get almost buried in a plastic planter with either soil from the garden or a mix of potting soil and clayish garden soil, from near the subsoil. As this stays outside all winter long, it gets covered with a piece of chicken wire to keep the squirrels out. The planter gets water if the soil looks dry. Occasionally I will check if the cones have senesced enough to crumble apart. If so, the seeds get pushed a half inch or so beneath the soil surface.\n\nThey spend the winter outside and get supplemental water if we have a dry period. If we get temperatures in the low 20s, the pots get set in the garden near the brassicas, and everything gets tree leaves dumped on them until it warms up again. \nThey normally sprout in very early spring and get potted to 1qt or larger containers once they are 3-4in tall, before the roots get all entangled. The soil is usually garden soil mixed with compost. The pots spend the summer under a crepe myrtle  tree with open shade, and get a bit of late afternoon sun. They get fried with any more sun exposure unless watered religiously.\n\nOnce they are bigger they tolerate full sun.\n\nI'm into dwarf conifers, so I started growing these from seeds on a whim, to see if anything unusual happened. I therefore collect small cones, in the hopes the seeds are more stressed or produce stunted growth. I do make sure to get a couple of full-size cones so something grows. I've gotten one tree that has stayed small, maybe it will eventually hit a growth spurt. I've gotten a couple with more yellow foliage, but they tend to burn in the sun. The rest of them grow for 1-2 years in larger pots and then get donated to VA Native Plant Society sales or the local river stewardship organizations.\n\nTLDR: they are surprisingly easy to grow.\n\nThis is so helpful. I love bald cypress. They remind me of a huge fern. There's one nearby, so now I'll be on the lookout for a few cones!\n\nThis is excellent news, thank you for your detailed reply! What a gift you have, being able to pay it forward through your hobby. :)\n\nBald cypress unfortunately isn’t a native species where I live, our winters also reach -40C not including the windchill! Lol\n\nWhat do you think of the plan I outlined in the main post?\n\nI think they need cold stratification, i.e. a period of 2 months in the refrigerator in a plastic bag with some damp soil or damp perlite. Then into soil that is heavier than just perlite. I don't know if a heat mat is necessary; based on my experience with starting vegetables and flowers it does hasten germination. As soon as most of the seed has germinated I would take them off the heat mat. As others have said, go very lightly with fertilizer. I don't fertilize mine except for the low-quality compost from around the edges of the compost pile, that gets mixed into the garden soil (itself lower-quality, because I don't want to give away the good soil that I've worked to build up for the vegetables). They still grow very well.\n\nRemember, in the wild they are native to swampy areas and floodplains. The soil is not aerated, but dense and frequently or constantly saturated.\n\nThey also seek full sunlight in the wild. They will need plenty of light if kept indoors. Grow lights are expensive. For starting vegetables I have good luck with LED \"shop lights\" that are similar in shape to old fluorescent light fixtures.\n\nThe idea of growing them in an aquarium is fantastic and so cool looking. I have also kept a few of the seedlings to try bonsai with. I hope your bald cypress experiment works out and you can realize your dream with them. One more thing, I would order and start 2-3 times as many seeds as the final number of trees you want.\n\nResources:\n\nhttps://www.srs.fs.usda.gov/pubs/misc/ag_654/volume_1/taxodium/distichum.htm\n\nhttps://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;opi=89978449&amp;url=https://plants.usda.gov/DocumentLibrary/plantguide/pdf/pg_tadi2.pdf&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiPj42z_vmIAxUWKlkFHeN7BZoQFnoECDEQAQ&amp;usg=AOvVaw0gAxG63kR8qOfXl7GrBvZo\n\nhttps://forums.botanicalgarden.ubc.ca/threads/bald-cypress-taxodium-distichum-seeds.46370/\n\n&gt; senesced\n\nThank you for making me aware of this word \n\nI love that you're just \"into dwarf conifers\" lol. \n\nI live in Zone 8a. I get little conifers (that I haven't identified yet) popping up in my neglected planters, and I love watching them grow from tiny little twigs into tiny little Christmas trees. They have all died before I ever transplanted them anywhere, but I have so many plastic cat litter buckets I've saved for things like this. \n\nDo you think your directions would work as a general guide for most conifers? Like, move to a bigger pot at 3-4 inches tall, etc? \n\nThanks for your time and your detailed response!\n\nDwarf conifers are a whole separate rabbit hole: https://www2.conifersociety.org/\n\nI'm also in Zone 8a. I would try to narrow down what you are dealing with, to give you the greatest chance of success. Is it a Juniperus, Pinus, etc.? What commonly grows in your area, and is there one nearby producing the seeds? Knowing at least the genus and the common species around you can let you find their preferred habitat and soil type, soil structure, and water and light requirements.\n\nThere are free plant ID apps that can be very helpful. I have good success with PlantNet Plant Identification.\n\nAs for extrapolating to most conifers, I don't have the experience to say. Some send down tap roots and would have to be moved before that (Longleaf pine for example). I would just try with your seedlings and see what happens.\n\nI've killed many baby trees by planting them out too soon. I've learned to pamper them with shade and water, and to wait until the fall to plant them in the ground, no matter how badly I want to see them in that perfect spot in the bed. In the fall and winter they can leisurely grow roots and get established before facing the summer brutality.\n\nOh wow, thanks so much for the link!!\n\nAnd of course all of the other information! I have a lot of research to do 😊\n\nLMFAO I thought the same thing \"into dwarf conifers\" and I love them for clarifying it even more. I feel so at home here.\n\nYou are clearly a more experienced gardener than it, but an easy way to separate plants with intertwined roots is to put them in a bucket of water.  The water kinda keeps everything suspended and makes it infinity easier.  I've propagated thousands of water lillys this way.  It makes it easy enough you basically don't care it's all tangled and will keep putting it off lol.\n\nThis is basically what my yard in Fla looks like right now with all these hurricane bands (and another coming next week).  My 3 bald cypress are under water and extremely happy.  Haven’t been able to cut the rest of the lawn in over a month though due to flooding.  Oh well.  The egrets are very happy to be fishing in my ponds.\n\nPlease be safe and help your neighbors when you can.\n\nAlways.\n\nWishing you well as you face the impending weather!!\n\nI don't have an answer for you.\n\nBut, what a unique aquarium.  Super cool to see a view of the trees growing like that.\n\nHow much does something like this cost? And are cypress easy to grow in water?\n\nCypress do best when germinated on dry ground. They can survive inundated conditions for an extended period of time but it's not the optimal growing situation for them. They do best where there are seasonal fluctuations in water level. One of the reasons \"ghost forests\" are spreading is because they are being exposed to increasing salinity levels and increased periods of inundation in the wild when overland flow and drainage has been interrupted due to human activity.\n\nMangroves might be a better option for aquariums\n\nRed Mangroves work best for freshwater, unfortunately ordering the propagules from the USA costs $40+ each not including shipping or working out the exchange.\n\nThey’re absolutely a suitable alternative but the differences in appearance, speed of growth etc have me pursuing cypress. :)\n\nIf you can source seedlings in your area it’s 100% cheaper &amp; easier. The nurseries I found online (8+ hours away or international) sell them for $10-15 each. This would be my first choice if I could.\n\nI’ve found a highly rated Etsy seller in my country who sells 25 seeds for $19.99. They grow very well in water, they usually are found growing at the water’s edge. Not only do they withstand extended periods of time living in flooding they’re spending most of their lives with “wet feet”.\n\nI’ve only been researching bald cypress instead of red mangroves for a few days so if I’m incorrect or have misunderstood anything I would appreciate being corrected.\n\nI will venture to say growing any plant or tree in stagnant water with no means of being oxygenated will kill 10/10 times. You’ll need something to stir up the surface of the water like an air stone, submersible water pump etc.\n\nThere are swampy areas and sheltered, small ponds here that I would think of as having very low dissolved oxygen levels, and bald cypresses still grow in them. The surrounding trees dump leaves into the water so there is organic matter for bacteria to consume _with the oxygen_ in the water, and they are small enough that wind probably doesn't contribute much oxygen.\n\nIf you have an air stone it would help keep the water clearer and couldn't hurt the bald cypresses.\n\nFunny how nobody seems to realize this is not a photo of your setup\n\nGreetings from Louisiana. You should be aware that these grow FEET per year. So you might get away with having them a year or two, and I can't swear you won't get sap in the water. What I can say is this would be a nice start to a tree you'd then have to adjust to being outside, possibly at the edge of a pond as they do very well in waterlogged soil. At full height you're talking 60-120 feet, but you may or may not be alive to see that.\n\nThey are a very popular choice for bonsai growers for this reason and it’s my intention to do the same. :) Albeit it will take some invented techniques as I won’t have the planter base to wire it to, lol.\n\nI do love the appearance of the ones in the photo but the bonsais with tapered bases and “knees” are gorgeous too.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2akcfxhwvctd1.jpeg?width=820&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0b479fdda6b5adbe8483ed4af93c44736df95f53\n\nWell, bonsai you take the plant out and cut the roots, this would probably be pretty messy in an aquarium, not to mention there's much more room for growth of roots and knees.\n\nI have tried bald cypress from seed and been unsuccessful with germination. Do they need stratification or scarification?  Any tips for germination?\n\nyes they require stratification\n\nHey, if you read some of the nested comments above I wrote out the best advice I’ve found to increase success.\n\nAnd the funny answer is add water to your plan of attack 😂\n\nTouché 😆\n\nIf i was a shrimp or fish i would be happy to live there\n\nWere those actually grown from seed?  It looks like rooting cuttings.\n\nI was going to suggest this too, really looks that way to me.\n\nThe photo kicking around on Pinterest without any supporting information but I agree with you.\n\nI have a bald cypress and it’s a love / hate relationship. I love her … until November when she drops all her hair. She’s huge so it literally covers everything for about a month until the last storm knocks off what’s left. Sometimes it takes longer and is just the gift that keeps on giving. \n\nAnyway, they seem easy enough to grow, as the pods will sometimes germinate and pop up around my property. That’s the extent of my knowledge, I’m sorry! Good luck though.\n\nThank you!\n\nI really want to see a turtle in there. That looks amazing\n\nSome musk turtles would be perfect!\n\nDude how I need steps\n\nDo they have to be raised indoors? I wouldn’t think they would be good for that, definitely very messy in the fall. Where are you sourcing seeds? Do they not provide growing information? I know one thing, they live in highly acidic low fertility environments and you can kill them with too much nutrition. I got one that looked like a dry stick 15 years ago and it has lived in a pot in my yard since then. One of my most prized plants, all I do is keep the pot topped up with water and trim the roots every couple years and repot.\n\nLooks amazing\n\nI love this!!!!! Cool\n\nThis is the coolest post I’ve seen on this subreddit 🥹\n\nIdk anything about how to grow these so I have no advice to give here. Best of luck!\n\nI didn't know this kind of tree existed!  Now I'm thinking we should make bald cypress mangrove forests all over the cooler coasts to protect ourselves from storms, floods, and tsunamis!\n\nADVANCED gardening. This is absolutely incredible\n\nWhomever built this tank is a legend, a nameless/faceless god that I aspire to be!\n\nThis is absolutely amazing you inspired me and intrigued me this idea thank you so much for sharing\n\nMy pleasure! I came across it while researching red mangroves in aquariums and pivoted to these. :)\n\nr/bonsai meets r/plantedtank\n\nOmg this is beautiful\n\nWow!!!\n\nWhat a beautiful setup! It's a mini swamp!\n\nI thought they was ball cypress because they make the green seed balls. I looked it up and \"Bald Cypress\" is their name.\n\nI have absolutely no clue but that looks cool as hell\n\nVery cool set up! I feel the zen-ness thru the photo 🫡🙌\n\n[removed]\n\nI love this\n\nNice\n\nMy neighborhood got a bunch of free trees. I and a few neighbors selected bald cypress. They all died. Since we live in TX, I'm assuming it's because Texas\n\nI live in Austin TX and there are a tons of bald cyprus here.\n\nThey are so lovely. We are not defeated and will try again!\n\nI wonder how big these’ll get indoors :o\n\nthat is so beautiful\n\nvery cool\n\nOoo I like that!\n\nwtf this is a gorgeous set up\n\nThis is awesome!!! 🤩\n\nbreathtaking honesty\n\nOh I love that, its so serene\n\n[deleted]\n\nYes\n\nSuper cool\n\nhow do they stay so small?  they're beautiful.\n\nWow, this is beautiful\n\nThat’s similar to how I grew my bald cypress saplings, I put them in a pots and them put them in a wide pan with water, they grew like weeds\n\nI’ve heard growing them exactly as you do can encourage them to grow more knees! Have you found this to be true? Do you use non porous pots?\n\nHey @ButtonMcThickums, any update on your grow attempt?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3pj2agommh9e1.jpeg?width=1206&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9526498f46963b629d74ab4853324607f95631eb\n\nThis is as far as I’ve gotten. 😆\n\nI actually had forgotten about the order and it looks like it got lost in the mail. Thank you for commenting, I went ahead and messaged him! It’s really important that I can get my hands on them asap given the way they need to be stratified etc.\n\nThey grow 1-2ft a year so I’m definitely playing the long game. After some thought I decided I’m not interested in spending around $100 on a 3ft seedling that may or may not transition well to growing hydroponically.\n\nWhen I have updates I will comment again!\n\nI have a bunch of pond and bald cypress seeds. I’ll send you dine if you can pay shipping. Message me if interested.\n\nI just saw this, sending you a message! :)\n\nThis is amazing!!! how often do progress pics expect to come in? would love to see this posed on a black backdrop, wood really bring out all the details.\n\nNinja edit: Did not read, eyes ate photo first. For everyone else: OP said (the photo is not mine but just an example of what I’m recreating)\n\nwow this is SO COOL also have 0 inputs sorry just here to cheer you on\n\nThey will eventually die without a cooler dromancy period. Or you could leave your window open nights, because bald cypress don't need such low temps\n\nThis is the reason I love this sub!\n\nThis is cool AF! I'm a little jealous\n\nThis one looks great!\n\nIncredible, creative...it's wonderful.\n\nAs a Louisiana resident, respect.\n\nCan this be kept as Bonsai inside that fishtank?\n\nI'm not used to seeing these indoors but they look great\n\nDope set up\n\nNew favorite set up\n\nCypress is a plant 🥹.\n\nWait..... you can do this. Wtf!!!! And another project for me to do thanks reddit.\n\nAlso see r/bonsai for growing small bald cypress in containers advice\n\nExcellent suggestion!\n\nThat is where I initially began searching for information. While I do love the tall, slender profile of the trees in this photo that growth pattern isn’t sustainable. I plan on using bonsai techniques to limit vertical growth, thicken the trunk and encourage development of knees.\n\nI grabbed another photo off of Google as an example. Applying certain bonsai methods without a container to secure wiring etc will require an abundance of jimmyrigging, lol. At least height will be no problem.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w1ot4fzhw3td1.jpeg?width=820&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7ba2b2dbb6456925c7375879d0c6d83b989db3fb\n\nThat's so cool!\n\nThis is incredible!!!\n\nHow could I set something like this up in a classroom? This would be awesome for my students.\n\nI don't want fish but also don't know enough about aquatic plants.\n\nI love this!! I have bamboo in my aquarium but the cypress is so gorgeous\n\nI grow plants in my tanks, but this is the coolest thing I’ve seen so far\n\nCool as fuck\n\nThat is epic! They grow so slow, you will be able to enjoy them for a while.\n\nwould be cool to stock the tank with Elassoma evergladei, i had a sort of similar idea with rice plants and a Betta\n\nHoly smokes, that’s cool as hell!\n\nthis is the coolest thing i have ever seen\n\nLook for a good orthopedic surgeon in your area. Thare will be a lot of knee problems as they get older.\n\nThat looks like fun. You can probably find info on growing Cypress from University of Louisiana Lafayette. They have a Cypress swamp on campus and I'm sure have done multiple studies on the ecosystem.\n\nLol, I love their knees, so worth it. :P\n\nThank you!\n\nThat’s impressive. 😎\n\nThis is awesome\n\nWowowowow!\n\nThese would make fascinating bonsai\n\nThis goes hard\n\ni love it !\n\nha ha very cool I wonder if they will grow little pneumatophores\n\nHow old are those trees? \nHow big were they when you put them in?\n\nThey were seeds\n\nNeat! How old are they in this picture?\n\nThis isn’t my tank but I was seeking advice on how to grow the cypress from seeds.\n\nHoly crap this is awesome\n\nThis is so cool!!!\n\nThis is incredible.\n\nBeautiful\n\nThat is so cool!\n\nVery very cool\n\nI love this ❤️ It looks so cool! Well done 👏\n\nAmazing!\n\nThat’s super cool ❤️\n\nSuperrrrr cool! Love it!\n\nThat is awesome !!!!!!\n\nYour biggest challenge is going to be providing winter dormancy with that setup. You might as well order saplings because it will take 4-6 years of growing the tree in the ground to get it that big."

Good job OP!\n\nIt got a laugh out of me lol\n\nLol! It really is a big beauty indeed!\n\nHow old is something like this?\n\nShe’s at least 15 years old.\n\nAmazing\n\nI'm glad you are showing it off. It magnificent!!! I also wonder how old it is.😍\n\nI just really love the shape she has taken! Gave her a full chop last year and she really filled out over the summer. She’s at least 15 years old.\n\nIt's funny how plants do after a good chop. Did you make starters from your cuttings?\n\nWhere I live this type of cactus is common so I assumed people wouldn’t want any starts, but shoot who knows, maybe I should’ve.\n\nPrickly Pear margaritas.  They are very good.\n\nOk, brilliant, you have my attention.. simply by using the strained juice? Or more complex?\n\nBlend the fruit then strain the gloop in a mesh strainer to get the seeds and macro bits. Then combine with the usual margarita ingredients, or to be easy just mix in tequila/vodka with ice.\n\nCareful handling the fruits. They have those super tiny spines.\n\nOh yeah good advice. When we were younger, we would take them off the cactus and my dad taught us how to handle them. Leather gloves are the best.  Sliced up with lemon salt and a little bit of chili spice very yummy.\n\nCame here to say this!! So freaking good. Whenever I see it on a menu I immediately have to get it.\n\nBeautiful! I want some tunas! :-)\n\nNothing like the fresh tunas 😆\n\nTunas 😋 ¡Que rica!\n\nShe's cute. Have you tried eating any of her?\n\nThank you 😊 yes I have made nopales from her, a traditional Mexican dish, and last year I juiced the fruit and drank that straight, the seeds within the fruit are just a pain, given I don’t eat them.\n\nNopales are a seriously underrated and underused veggie. I can't have tacos without them now. Damn you Arandas!\n\nArandas doesn't play.\n\nexcited for you to pick those tunas 😋\n\nI must handle with care 😆\n\nMy late dad was a master in peeling them with his bare hands. In Morocco, where he grew up, this is a seasonal delicacy and he was adamant that his children experienced it too.\n\nAwwww… she’s beautiful 😍\n\nThank you! I feel like I finally got it trimmed to grow in a perfect formation.\n\nGorgeous specimen. You've taken care of her very well. 💚\n\nThank you 🙏🏼 she doesn’t take much care, just good haircuts.\n\nWhat is the key to keeping the margins of the leaves from drying out? I struggle with succulents.\n\nI’d say neglect goes a long way with any succulent.\n\nAnd the pears are a perfect color for picking.\n\nThe plan is to harvest this weekend and make some jelly!\n\nSo ? What state are you in that they grow that good in \nAnd. How do you harvest the pair and fo you eat the other part too \nI see cactus in stores here in FTW Tx but don’t know what to do with them 😕\n\nI’m in California. You can harvest the fruit by cutting it right at the base where it meets the main pad, make sure to wear gloves because these thorns are little needles, then you can burn off the thorns with a lighter. When the individual pads are young, they are a lighter green and more tender, you chop them off and you can even just season them to grill; the best way to eat it, in my opinion, is in the form of “Nopales,” it’s a Mexican dish.\n\nWowww she's gorgeous! Mine was angry this year for some reason and only produced 4 tunas (last year had 40+). I made some tuna swirled lemon bars, highly recommend if you have any leftover after making jelly!\n\nThank you 😊 swirled lemon bars sound amazing, do you happen to have a go to recipe?\n\nI do! I used this cranberry one that I've had past success with. https://homecookedharvest.com/cranberry-lemon-bars/. The tuna layer is less dense than the cranberries so instead of the layers in the blog pictures you get a nice swirl!\n\nI'm thinking about one of these. I haven't decided for sure because my area can get quite wet. I know I would have to create an area of different soil, or a huge pot.\n\nIve never handled one out of this zone but they are very low maintenance here. We get a decent amount of rain come the winter and she never looks like she’s being washed away. Maybe worth a try, or at least like you mentioned, in a pot.\n\nGORGEOUS!! 🙌🏽\n\nThank you! 😊\n\nDelicious!! And beautiful!\n\nAmen to that!\n\nYehh you made me jealous 😝\n\nYou can almost taste it through the phone 😆\n\nI wish I could make the little pad I have in my garden grow into this faster.\n\nOne day 💚they will reach great heights\n\nI hope you eating all those Tunas(prickly pear)  🤤\n\nHow long did it take to get that big lmao\n\nAt least 15 years 😆\n\n[removed]\n\nThank you 😊\n\nSuch a healthy nopal!!\n\nI don’t take off too many of the young branches so that she stays big and strong ☺️\n\nWhat a beauty!  ♥️\n\nThank you 😊\n\nGorgeous! How old is it?  Do you know the variety/cultivar?\n\nThank you! She’s at least 15 years old and she’s a good ol Prickly-pear cactus (opuntia).\n\nWhoa. Impressive!\n\nThank you!\n\nThat’s amazing!\n\nThank you! 😊\n\nGorgeous❤️\n\nThank you 😊\n\nWwwwoooowww. (says the autistic kid at a classical music symphony)\n\nThank you 😊she does have that wow factor.\n\nGorgeous 😍 Idk if mine could get that big. I love nopales. I'd be eating them like every day lol\n\nThank you 😊 you can tell the people in the neighborhood that might actually eat them every day lol theirs are picked clean lol\n\nWow that's a big prickly pear\n\nWhere do you live?.\n\nCalifornia coast\n\ndelicious\n\nSmash… next question\n\nI always wondered what the fruit taste like..\n\nWow 😲 Thank you for sharing. She's gorgeous 😍\n\nThey... have fruits? I have one. \n\nWe had a big one when I was a kid. \n\nWow. Impressive.\n\nWow.  Zone 7a mine is still really close to the ground and probably will never get this glorious.  Awesome job!\n\nWe liberated a few paddles from a construction site last summer and she put on 6 new paddles this year!\n\n\nI planted another native one near her that's a \"ground cover\" variety.\n\n\nI'm excited to see them in a couple years.\n\nWHOAAAAAA!!!! ITS BEAUTIFUL!\n\nWow! That is gorgeous.\n\nI was in Malta years ago and there was prickly pear cactus all over the place. They even made liqueur with it.  This photo reminds me of that trip. It was a good trip.\n\nSo nice looking time to make jelly\n\nWhat zone / geographic area are you in? I want one!!\n\nZone 9a, Northern California.\n\nI'm so jealous! I miss the cacti in the southwest.\n\nThis is your sign to get yourself a compatible cactus friend 😉\n\nI miss my cactus.\n\nCan you eat those?\n\nAbsolutely and I plan to 🍴\n\nYUMMY!❤️\n\nwow, that is a big boy!!\n\n👍\n\nYummy\n\nBeautiful ❤️ \n\nBeautiful cactus, will you use the pears? \n\nCactus pears are good- the hard seeds are a bit of a pain though, lol.\n\nYes 😁 I plan on making jelly from them this weekend\n\nWaow!\n\nVery pretty is the fruit as tasty as it looks to me :)\n\nIt’s tasty and not too sweet, tons of seeds though\n\nMmmm I have like 9 or 10 different varieties of prickly pear that are only on their 3rd year of making pads and since I've been splitting the pads to propagate them, I haven't been letting them grow to get fruit yet but that's the plan the next year or two.\n\nhow old this plant is?\n\nCan anyone tell me what the fruit tastes like?\n\nWow that’s stunning!\n\nSweet!\n\nShe’s a beaut!\n\nMine hasn’t grown anything in them! Just the cactus\n\nThis is  gorgeous\n\nGod, she's gorgeous! and giving you so much fruit :)\n\nLook at that fruit! Lovely. I needed some eye bleach.\n\nAbsolutely gorgeous!!\n\nBeautiful\n\nIt's so beautiful! I hope the jelly you make with it turns out delicious, because that cactus looks well taken care of\n\nThank you, I hope so too ☺️\n\nLooks amazing! What zone are you at?\n\nThank you, I’m in zone 9a\n\nMmm prickly pear. My favorite juice!\n\nWow i like it!\n\nSoooo magnificent!\n\nLook at all that delish fruit\n\nSo gorgeous\n\nBeautiful I had some when I lived in Phoenix.  The quail would run around them in the morning 🥰\n\nI have one about that size and I have yet to be able to take the fruit without lots of boo boos.  Someone told me to stick a skewer in one and burn the little spines off then process?  Idk.  That would have to change the taste?   How do you get the prickles off?\n\nSame! Just take a lighter and torch the little thorns off.\n\n😍\n\nOmg it’s huge! Amazing\n\nI bet it slaps when it’s windy!! 💨\n\nAfter my toddler fell into my neighbors cactus and I had to pull over 100 needles out of him, I swore I’d never have a cactus in my yard as long as I live. It was a nightmare! Pretty but deadly!\n\nBeautiful!! So many prickly pear margaritas too!\n\nWow. We don’t have those in Iowa! Are the orange…things….edible???\n\nYes they are! ☺️\n\nNever seen one bear fruit"

Like microgreens, but microradish! \n\nI was thinking the same thing, or maybe even pickling a bunch of these almost like cocktail onions\n\nI'll put tiny radishes on the list for next year!\n\nfirmly grasp it\n\n⭐️\n\nMini but Mighty!\n\nI had a mini one and ate it. Warning: it had all the spice of a normal radish in one nibble.\n\nLove this !! A tiny beauty\n\nWhen you eat it, what do you plan on doing with any leftovers?\n\nThat’s one tiny fish.\n\nIt has a good personality\n\nThat's rad! (ish)\n\nAn effort was made...\n\nLookit the girth on that bad boy! You'll eat for weeks...\n\nMini garden perfection 👌\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/dtpysv9s6gvd1.gif\n\nI love this but also snorted so loud I woke my five year old\n\nLol well I'm  glad I could give you a laugh!\n\nWhoa! you picked a big one!\n\nMy radishes were the size of baseballs...EVERYTHING else was teeny...carrots...turnips...tomatoes. first timer though\n\nNO ONE CAN TAKE THAT AWAY FROM YOU! 😂 Show that baby like it’s a veggie of honor!\n\nThat's a giant raddish man, bigger than most!!!\n\nMy radish, without me, is useless. Without my radish, I am useless\n\nCan I just ask why you thought it was ready? 😅\n\nHaha I got hungry! But seriously, it was just a rogue radish that I found while digging up another bed plot\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4f3bi8qibivd1.jpeg?width=767&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f355f5332f5a4d76283cfb1cb87bd8484d207766\n\nMy friend's pepper.\n\nRemember, lift with your legs!🤣\n\nProud papa!!\n\nThis is so relateable\n\nWhat’s your radish’s name?!?!\n\nHmmm. Olimar after Olimar from Pikmin!\n\nThis will make one hell of a salad!\n\nOh my lord!!! It’s the real life jolly green giant!!!\n\n‘There are dozens of us dozens!”\n\nYo bro! Riflemans Creed broski! Fucking lol dude, I only know it from \"Full Metal Jacket\" but you are a true gardening warrior 🤣👊. No radish left behind😅\n\nYou’re going to need a toothpick!\n\nI have no idea how people survived before grocery stores. That looks about like the potato I got. Put one in the ground, get one back that’s even smaller.\n\nUgh it barely fits in your hand\n\nHey, the petites are the best!\n\nPut it back, that’s for the fairies 🧚\n\nThe caption made me laugh way too hard !\n\nThink of all the stews you can make\n\nImpressive!\n\nMan, that is huge!\n\nHad a carrot like that once!\n\nI love pickled radishes\n\nLooks pretty average to me\n\nThat is a magnificent radish, sir! 🫡\n\nAww! That’s the best radish ever! Enjoy it! Expect it to be a little spicy.\n\nIt’s magnificent!\n\nSo little...It's just too cute!😩\n\nYou’re a dad, congratulations\n\n*faints*\n\nPutting out the big fishes.\n\nMy Raddish is my best friend. It‘s my life.\n\nJoke’s on us! Your giant 5x larger-than-normal-size hand is making that radish look puny in comparison.\n\nCongratulations! She’s perfect! 🥹\n\nWell en... oh you already did it.\n\nThe leaf looks so different than the radishes I buy from the store!\n\nnow that's a catch!\n\nIt's not a little rad, it's radish\n\nOne radish to bewilder them all.\nOne radish to unite them all.\n\nOne radish to be eaten be one.\n\n*my precious*\n\nThe most delicious radish ever!\n\nThat’s the sample size.\n\nahmm.. ok that's all yours bro. lols!\n\nBrilliant!\n\nA whole calorie all to yourself!\n\nYou bet!\n\nI love this! I am also growing radishes in my container and at a lost for when to harvest! The package said 25 days and it’s been more than that. They still look like babies 😂\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0bk41r7drjvd1.jpeg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a9bcaf5d7a4bad7ed91c3598e3d9634878957f80\n\nSFMF!\n\nThought this was r/Pikmin for a second\n\nHold on tight, bro! Its a beast!\n\nThat's about the size of my onions from last year's harvest. They were the perfect size for a martini 😂\n\nYes!!!   Thank you for this, I needed the giggle.  That’s one hell of a radish you have there!\n\nIt's a great radish. I felt that way about a cherry tomato last year. It was very small, and the only one.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ulhs5awu2lvd1.jpeg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3ac3dd2009a7f66c22e156dc04ed3f5bd6b2b210\n\nFinally a place to show my beet 🙃\n\nr/mightyharvest! :D\n\nAnd a mighty radish it is!\n\nSalad Material!\n\nMy radish is my best friend. \nWithout my radish, I am useless.....\n\nall mine look like this 😭\n\nSemper Fi tiny radish man ✌️\n\nmy radish is my best vegetable. it is my life. i must master it like i must master my life. \nwithout dirt, my radish is useless. without my radish, i am useless. i must crunch my radish true. i must crunch harder than my hunger that is trying to kill me. i must eat it before it eats me.\n\nMe with my first carrot harvest this year 🤣 love it!\n\nPls only use your best silvers to eat like royalty.\n\nThat feeling when you hug a radish ♥️\n\nWTG Poopsnack! Lol\n\nThis would be perfect on a dating profile.\n\n🤣🤣\n\nI love your headline! Cracked me up!\n\n😂🤦🏻‍♀️😂\n\nGood for you - keep the biggest one for yourself, I always say!\n\nChef's share 😉\n\n🤣🤣🤣🤣\n\nI feel ya! I have had that happen with carrots! There were like 3 and they all looked like witch fingers. All bent and zig zagged!\n\nIdk I've never seen one quite like it 🌱\n\nCongrats :)\n\nLooks tasty!\n\nTiny radish hhhhhha\n\nAwe... I love it!\n\nIt is perfect!\n\nThe most important thing is, it's yours.\n\nIts like the line in Full Metal Jacket\n\nLovely little radish\n\nAwww it's cuwute\n\n😂😂🙄\n\nIs it running to anywhere?\n\nI think you need more BEES\n\n🤣\n\nLmao\n\nDon’t eat it all in one bite! Savor that baby.\n\nThere are not many like that....\n\nIt's totally average!\n\nConsistent fertilization with organic fertilizer, consistent watering, 6-8 hours of sun and that will be much bigger. Don’t give up.\n\nMighty\n\nBru my radishs don't even grow anything except a small 1 by 1 mm thick stem 😭\n\nAppropriating the “Rifleman’s Creed” I see 🤣\n\nI'm nothing without my radish! My radish is nothing without me! 😂\n\nYou’ve got feed/ loosen the soil and just a guess reduce the stress(inconsistent watering, hot-cold spikes etc.) to help get bigger radishes:)"

Just looking makes me think it must be so calming and relaxing for you to sit in your garden after a long day.\n\nYour hard work paid off platinum beauty. Thank you for sharing. It made my day. \n\nBest wishes.\n\nThank you :)\n\nI visit it often as I work from home. Some sparrows and other birds visit for some water daily. \n\nIt definitely keeps me calm :)\n\nOver the years pics: https://www.reddit.com/r/gardening/s/Wqi4dHiQhY\n\nThank you for sharing your progress photos!! \nYour garden space is stunning 💜\nHappy Diwali 💜\n\nIt gives me hope that maybe my garden will grow eventually into something lovely that I can enjoy. So far, my green thumb is more lure for invasive bugs than a relaxing garden. Lol. \n\nI'm going to follow you to enjoy your captivating garden photos if you don't mind. It's the gardens we build that i find most captivating because it shows the caring soul in its hand that grows it. \n\nBest wishes, and thank you again.\n\nHappy Diwali!!\n\nJust a reminder to everyone regarding garden lights: please turn them off at night. Pollinators and other animals need the dark to maintain balance between predator/prey, and having lights on them leads to bug loss. Beautiful garden though!\n\n+1\n\nThere is a gecko living somewhere in there as well. I haven't seen him in the past couple of weeks but it will show up as it always does.\n\nThis is incredible! Thankyou for sharing the beauty 😊\n\nThank you :)\n\nDid you making the structure yourself? Could you share how you went about building it and securing it?\n\nThe vertical shelves? They are 6 inches in width, I got them made by a local metal worker. \n\nI wanted them to look like steps, but at the end we fit them by descending order \n\nIt cost me some 6K rs back then\n\nLooks like a lovely little happy place. 😊\n\nBeautiful and zen\n\nThis is original content. I have clicked these pics. OC \n\n:)\n\nThis is the coolest thing. So inspiring.\n\nA magical place!\n\nMy sentiments exactly!\n\nLove love love this! ✨Happy Diwali!\n\nThis looks amazing.

Someone suggested that it's the subreddit for these kind of pics.\n\nIt’s like a real life Stray scene!! I love love love it!\n\nSuch a magical place. Did you do fireworks\n\nAh not in here, I have those small ping ball bombs that I use to scare off pigeons. \n\nBut that's all in the last few years\n\nIs it a bomb that explodes or just lights that don’t have movement in any way.\n\n[deleted]\n\nThanks so much. They look fun. Went to Diwali ceremony and so much fun with dancing singing outfits and decorating and food. So many houses lit with lights. How’s your area celebrating\n\nWhat a lovely little sanctuary. Thanks for sharing!\n\nThat looks so beautiful!!!\n\nThis is now my dream balcony 😍. \n\nSuch a pristine garden!

Real question, do you have lots of spiders out there? I want to do this to my patio space with all the plants but I’m worried I’ll be walking though spider webs left and right.\n\nI have to say there are at least half a dozen spiders but the little ones. I leave them to be for a week there are few incepts that visit the garden including some bees. I like to watch them before ek clean up every week.\n\nAbsolutely beautiful!!!! What a magical place to start and end your day ❤️\n\nHappy Diwali! We've had some snow already where I live so our Diwalis are usually cold (we'll do like a few sparklers on our patio lol) and I'm envious of your indoor garden paradise. Love it so much!\n\nSo pretty I almost thought it was ai 🥲\n\nIt looks gorgeous!\n\nThat’s pretty\n\nLovely\n\nThis is such a beautiful space! It feels so peaceful.\n\nThis makes my soul so happy, thanks for sharing these beautiful photos!\n\nBeautiful! Happy Diwali!\n\nOh wow! This is so magical.

I will make you a cup of tea as well :)\n\nLooks magical 💚\n\nthis is beautiful!!\n\nGoals!\n\nBeautiful!!!\n\nr/CozyPlaces\n\nOkay this is garden goals living in an apartment.\n\nIt looks beautiful! ☺️👍\n\nLooks so beautiful it looks AI!\n\nBEAUTIFUL!!!!\n\nbeautiful click   \nIs this beautiful decoration for any special event?\n\nHi, this for diwali. We are supposed to put lights in and outside of our homes. It used to be traditional lamps, but a lot of lighting is done.\n\nOH Good   \nHappy Diwali\n\nजमलंय कांबळे!! मस्तच!\n\nLooks heavenly! Happy diwali 🎇\n\nThis is magical!\n\n😍\n\nHow beautiful. It’s taking all I have not to sing Michael Scott’s dewali song to you. Happy Dewali!\n\nYeah I love that song :)\n\nwhere are the lights from? i’m in love with them\n\nThe small one is that copper light with usb. The other is led with flowers on top \n\nLimited-time deal: fizzytech Flower Fairy led String Light 25 led 4 Meter Length Lights of Home Decoration Diwali Plastic Light for Party Birthday Diwali Christmas, Lights of Home Decoration - Gold https://amzn.in/d/1qdgyVA\n\nBro how do you take care of this place like how do you handle bugs and insects?\n\nBugs and insects are part of nature bro, you can't keep them away. The pests that are harmful, some easy ways to get rid of them. Better option to get the plants that don't attract a lot of bugs. \n\nBees visit daily though. They drink water and dive into whatever flowers there are. Then there are spiders, ants always there. Then some big bugs like cricket I even have a pic of this big beatle that stayed for a few hours. \n\nThen there is this gecko that also keeps them in limit 😂\n\nA lot of sparrows visit for water they enjoy the plants. I put water for them. Some crows every now and then. There are robins and other birds who I see a few times a week.\n\nOh, thanks for replying. Btw, the garden is very beautiful, and I wanted to add a garden in my home backyard, so I was very curious about how to handle it.\n\nIs this Heaven?🫣❤️\n\nOh, wow! Absolutely beautiful! It's so inviting. Happy Diwali! And say hello to the gecko for me!\n\nToo much light. Affects migrating birds and birds who hunt at night.\n\nYeah the light is only in diwali for a week and 2-3 hours. :)\n\nI take extremely good care of birds - except for pigeons.\n\nAhhh kinda messy. You want alive with plants not overgrown with leaves and Christmas lights\n\nYep some of the growth are just out of hands but I don't have a heart to cut them unless they get very difficult to manage :)\n\nFair enough\n\nToo cramped and ugly"

    "all_comment_text": "Please tell your grandma it’s beautiful.\n\nI sure will. I’m going to read her all of your comments. I already know it will bring a smile to her face.\n\nThat is so pretty! If you keep practicing and learning, I’m sure you’ll have your own garden someday :)\n\nThanks for the encouragement! :) It’s funny, my grandma and grandpa actually started their own landscaping business when they were in their 20s and retired around the time I was in middle school. Then there’s me, their only grandchild, who is basically deathly allergic to grass and tree pollen! Haha. I said to her, I know this might sound morbid, but it needs to be said: when you die someday (grandpa passed a few years ago) every time I garden or water my indoor plants I’m going to think of you two and I want you to be with me in that moment and help me not kill my plants. I told her, “don’t forget”. 😂\n\nYou can keep an Amaryllis going forever.  Ask Grandma if you can have it when she's gone.  Then every time it's blooms you'll have another reminder of her.\n\nOh I will! Especially since she gifted my mom one of the two she bought. It’s only fair I get dibs on her’s, right? Haha. I’ve already claimed her Christmas cacti.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pkt6uu71og5e1.jpeg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fe50cc5cc9f3a8c95d8da6702d25f708dd0e87f9\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gl0rtriaog5e1.jpeg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=01ce8b7af901086ec90609b282a219fb19c64e7f\n\nAlmost all of her Christmas cacti have blooms right now. Some of them were given to her by *her* mother, so they definitely have to be kept alive and passed down now. All of them are gorgeous but this one in particular is my fave because the blooms are a pretty orange color.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/49mpmx4jog5e1.jpeg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6bed211ecb5b4e2f2fbf48ff3eb11b75c1191efa\n\nTo make you feel better about this, I'm very much convinced I didn't inherit my grandma and great grandma's green thumb until they died 😂☠️ (one month apart too, different sides of the family) I killed so many plants before then but now have like 20 different plants and counting!!\n\nI always tell people it just takes finding the right plant category for your habits and how much you want to work at it. There is something for everyone.\n\nTell Grandma hi! Such beautiful flowers! Thanks for sharing.\n\nGrandma Rose says hi back and thank you :) I tried to talk her into downloading this app on her tablet and joining bc she’d love this community but she’s being a party pooper\n\nLove that she’s Grandma Rose! ❤️ she would love this app, just stay on garden pages!\n\nYes! I’m reading her these comments so maybe if we all bully her into joining she’ll do it lol\n\nCome on Grandma Rose! 🌹\n\nShe joined! u/rosie12597 :) she keeps calling the comments “reviews” LMAO\n\nHi u/rosie12597 !! \n\nYou’re awesome, and so are your beautiful plants &amp; grandkid! 🌸👋\n\nHaha, I love that! I’ll give her a follow! I bet she can teach us all a thing or two about gardening!\n\nI do want to see it. Tell her they’re gorgeous. ❤️\n\nStunning! I just potted my first amaryllis yesterday, and I am so hoping you'll send some of Grandma's talent our way.\n\nIt’s really so unfair. She makes it look so easy. Everything she touches thrives.\n\nI had a Mamaw like that. You could name her road, and people would know which house by her gardens. They have every right to be proud. It's a lot of hard, rewarding work!!\n\nI may not have much of a green thumb, but I try to enjoy it as much as she did.\n\nYou were right, tell her I said it’s lovely and happy holidays!\n\nShe said “same to you, thank you!” I told her how many people liked this post so far and she’s tickled lol\n\nand you were correct!   I love Amaryllis.\n\nI asked her what kind of flower it was called and she told me “armarilla” 😂 she’s so cute\n\nomg that's precious\n\nI’m so glad you shared, because she’s beautiful\n\nThe flower is pretty too.\n\nIt’s a beauty! Well done.\n\nJoin Grandma Rose ! Join ! Your amaryllis is absolutely stunning &amp; Id love to learn from you !\n\nI read this to her and she laughed and insisted she didn’t do anything 😂 she’s still being stubborn. If we keep getting on her though, I think she might give in. 😂\n\nEDIT: She finally caved and let me download the app on her tablet and make her an account! We did it!!! Her username is u/rosie12597\n\nWAS I THE REASON SHE CAVED ?! 🥹🖤\n\nI THINK YOU DEFINITELY HELPED 🫶🏼 I tried to get her to comment on here saying something like “hi I’m grandma” so she can take credit for her work but she’s being shy 😂 she might be more of a Reddit lurker until she warms up a little more haha\n\nShe's so darn cute , I just love her ! She's gotta share her secrets !!\n\nI always see them being sold at the store in boxes \nThanks for sharing\n\nI just asked her where she got it from and she said Lowe’s!\n\n[removed]\n\nI agree! My Mom’s birthday is in November and she actually gifted one to my Mom for her birthday!\n\nWhat a unique opportunity to see that!  I’ve never seen a bud or fully formed one this close.  Beautiful!\n\nI turned it towards the window and it’s already opening more! I remember walking into the room it’s in a few days after she bought it and seeing that it bloomed and I was like HOLY CRAP! The flowers are huge!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kcb4lun19g5e1.jpeg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=67fc4f91fd6f975dc98c5d7ca9a4ad777b34e932\n\nI should’ve thought to include a pic with my hand next to it in the post for size comparison\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7q54y6zm9g5e1.jpeg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dec3d76642592d04bbc3a80ba99036cd15699443\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0mm75tk1ag5e1.jpeg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1babe466934832e9a9e1d83cf8909194237626e9\n\nWow!  I’ve always bought lots of lillies for my coffee table so I could watch them open &amp; form.  I don’t know why that’s my favorite thing.  Stunning!\n\nWow! I never get one with more than 1 bloom!\n\nShe’ll call her sister and they’ll talk about plants and her sister will get mad because her plants don’t bloom like my grandma’s. She really does have a magical green thumb. It’s truly an unfair advantage if you ask me.\n\nLove that!\n\nAbsolutely stunning...how very lovely.Namaste from India.\n\nShe said thank you! Namaste right back to you friend! 🙏🏼\n\n**UPDATE: I think grandma just revealed her secret** She said these little round soil thingys came with her amaryllis that she got from Lowe’s. She said she didn’t use them and used “regular miracle grow potting soil instead”.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x39ol1kwig5e1.jpeg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=093b2d5c2c0693b74363b08e057c4486421e5ad9\n\nI saw a bunch of these near the checkout aisle at the grocery store.  They had their bulb dipped in wax and were marketed as the \"No watering required plant!\"  \n\nI guess you just buy it and let it bloom and once it runs out of water and begins to wilt you just throw it away?  This goes against everything in my gardening bones lol.  I would have also done what your grandma did and cut slits in it or something and plant it in real soil!\n\nWow\n\nIt's incredibly beautiful! She's made the world a prettier place by being in it\n\nThat is so sweet I’m going to make sure I tell her you said that 🥹🫶🏼\n\nGramdma amaryillis are the best......grandpas are too.\n\nPlease tell grams it is THE most beautiful amaryllis and we'd be overjoyed to see future flowers of hers!! Hugs to grandmas!\n\nLove the color!  Thanks for sharing 😍\n\nBeautiful! 🤩\n\n[deleted]\n\nTo reiterate, I don’t have a green thumb whatsoever and probably have no business even guessing, but I’ve heard people say before that rubbing Irish greens bar soap along door frames and leaving them in planters around the home keeps mosquitos away. I wonder if you were to do that near wherever you’re keeping your plant if it would help with the gnats. The fungus part I have zero possible solutions for lol. Hopefully someone else can help you out with some tips!\n\n[deleted]\n\nGet mosquito bits for fungus gnats! Cheap, easy, and quick solution. Won't work for almost anything else (mosquito and fungus gnat larvae only, I believe), but totally worth it. I sprinkle it on any plants if they were outside for the summer, as well as doing a treatment maybe once a year. I use it outside for mosquitos and give little baggies to family for their houseplants, and the container still lasts forever.\n\nSuch a lovely plant! Amaryllis today, tomatoes tomorrow! Keep at it! The secret with plants, for me, is a numbers game. I plant far more than I need to survive.\n\nReally lovely! Very double blooms; has she had this one for a while?\n\nShe got it the week before thanksgiving and the first bloom showed up just the other day! Now all of a sudden it has four! 😳\n\nThe room it’s currently in is room temp (she keeps the thermostat at 72° right now) it’s in a room that is pretty dark with the exception of the light that comes from the window it’s sitting in front of, and that’s the only window in that room.\n\nIn love with the color! I have two bulbs. One is red, the other a coral pink. That red with the fancy petals is gorgeous 😍 Learn as much as you can from her.\n\nTell your grandma we love it ❤️\n\nI made her download Reddit and made her an account purely just so she could be a part of this community because I know she’d enjoy it and after lots of insisting, she finally caved so now she can see these comments herself :) her username is u/rosie12597 :)\n\nYou were right, we absolutely did want to see it and it is GLORIOUS\n\nGive your Grandma thanks from us! \nThey bloomed beautifully.\nNever realised they looked like this, I'll keep an eye out to try growing myself here. \n\nWish her wonderfully Happy Holidays from me 🎄💜\n\nWill do! Happy holidays to you also! :)\n\nThank you for sharing this beauty! \n\nThere’s still time to learn your grandma’s ways with plants! Respect!\n\nAwe - Tell your grandma I love her. I don't have one anymore to say that to.\n\nAnd her amaryllis is beautiful.\n\nI’ll tell her. I’m willing to share her. 😊\n\nAmaryllis by mornin' , up from San Antone\n\nTell her thanks. It looks so good.\n\nJust stunning\n\nSuch a beauty\n\nGorgeous!\n\nBeautiful 🩷\n\nWow there so beautiful 😍\n\nBeautiful flowers ♥️\n\nYahh…..you were right!\n\nTell you Grandma that she has a lovely amaryllis\n\nGrandma is a plant magician. What beautiful blooms!\n\nSo pretty\n\nBeautiful color thanks for sharing ❤\n\nThank you for sharing this beautiful flower &amp; hi Grandma Rose!!! Hope you have a wonderful holiday season ❤️❤️❤️\n\nSo pretty!\n\nOh it's beautiful, thank you for sharing ❤️ I'm not at all familiar with this plant.

It makes me miss her.\n\nBeauty\n\nTell Grannie that I think that is the most beautiful Amaryllis that I have seen. And I come from a huge family of gardeners.\n\nVery nice!\n\nWoow que hermoso\n\nThank you :)\n\nAwww, I miss my grandma. Tell yours her amaryllis is gorgeous.\n\nBeautiful\n\nSo lovely! That’s my daughter’s middle name.\n\nIt's beautiful!\n\nThank you\n\nThanks for sharing grandma :)\n\nBeautiful!  Thank you for the memory!!!

For the last 10 years of her life, her 3 daughters and grandkids would each get an amaryllis bulb kit and we'd have bets for tallest, first flower, best looking. It was just a fun way of connecting with her about something she loved. Your mom's is prize winning worthy!\n\nBeautiful!! &lt;3\n\nIt’s maddening how blessed we are to be able to look at such beauty\n\nStunning!\n\nLove the color of this one.

    "all_comment_text": "I like how you expertly use your head to break your fall.\n\nBoonk\n\nOP got judo tossed by a sack of dirt and a twig.\n\nHe was just getting his daily dose of greens\n\nYou underestimated the friction of grass is what you did.\n\nA man in orange shorts is wheeling a tree using a two wheeled dolly along dry asphalt with a coefficient of friction of 0.7. Calculate the force in which the man in orange short's head makes contact with the ground when the dolly's wheels move from dry asphalt to grass with a coefficient of friction of 0.35. Assume the man, dolly, and tree are moving at 2.5km/hour.\n\nShow your work.\n\nExtra credit if you can accurately describe the onomatopoeia of the sounds the man in the orange shorts made upon making facial contact with the ground.\n\nI dont think to find the force of the man head making contact with the ground you'd need any of the data points given. Would F= ma work? 9.8 for a, dont know his heads mass. Im taking physics rn but im really bad at it so idk if im waffling rn\n\nWhen I had a nasty fall ( broken hip), as I hurtled to the ground, I used Newton's Second Law of motion to work out how hard I'd hit the ground. Actually I was in a hurry so I rounded 9.8 up to 10, because my mental arithmetic isn't that good. It gave me a reasonable approximation of how hard the fall would be. My other favourite is I have a wheeled gardening seat I use. But I have to be careful getting up and respect Newton's Third Law, to every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. Otherwise I go one way as the seat goes the other way, and I end up on the ground. Always respect the laws of physics when gardening.\n\nbro i can't even spell avocado right so i can't help you much\n\nThe true engineer\n\nNo it's gonna be more because he was already moving. The question is how much of the momentum is redirected downwards.\n\nYeah there is added angular acceleration as he pivots over the top of the hand truck. I think we'd also need to know the height of the hand truck.\n\nAnd the height of the man. But commonly in this situation it's fine to assume something reasonable. OP, are you tall?\n\nI'm just going for the extra credit, I would say: \"uh? ooh... uuuoooooooooo aaaaaah, PUAF, aaaaaaaaaouch, shit, ah fucking tree, ah.\n\nSurely grass would have a higher coefficient of friction.\n\nAssume frictionless grass and no air resistance\n\na spherical tree, and spherical man.\n\nAssume the cow is spherical.\n\nLooks like a midjourney prompt\n\nWho are you calling an orange short head?\n\n\n/s\n\nAs a HS teacher teaching physics for the first time in 30 years, I applaud this.\n\nWhat's best usa consumable plant to buy for gardening?\n\nUmm... use a wheelbarrow next time?\n\nLol yes. There's also a small drop at the end of the driveway that I did not expect.\n\nAt least they fell into the grass, and not on the concrete!\n\nI feel we should send this video to Randall Munroe (XKCD) to get a proper explanation. Perhaps we could also discover how much worse it would have been if the tree fell at near the speed of light.\n\nYep. That’s exactly how I broke my wrist rollerblading.\n\nI really like the 80s vibe of your camera\n\nIt looks like it was filmed near the elephants foot in Chernobyl.\n\nYeah, such a weird vibe, all these cameras I've been seeing lately with all kinds of little sprites flying around. At first I thought it was current-gen Samsung/iPhone phones oddly highlighting every little droplet of mist, but to see it on a Ring cam? So weird. So it's a filter then? What's the intent? Is it trying to replicate oldschool 8mm film? Because it is not at all that.\n\nDude the idea of having a filter for a ring camera makes me angry for some reason.\n\nIt's the ghosts.\n\nit's like lofi music. youngins want to seem authentic by introducing imperfections. It annoys the hell out of me too. Music is shitty enough with autotune.\n\nYeah seriously just please can't people fuck off with this shit. It just plain looks like ass, period.\n\nSent the ring footage to my neighbor. He spliced this gif together and put a filter on it.\n\nI was thinking it looked like his ring uses super 8 film\n\nSuper 8 is actually really good. I have home movies from the 90s that still look fantastic. OP's clip looks more like an 70s point and shoot with one of those cube shaped flashes on top.\n\nI needed this today. Thank you Tumbling Tree Dude 🫡\n\nI bet your favorite season is... wait for it... *fall*.\n\nThey are head over heels for the season.\n\nI’d say Spring first. And then Fall.\n\nBravo\n\nNot laughing at you. But, I feel your pain. (While chuckling)\n\nYou’re better than me, because I CACKLED\n\nIt’s ok. Can’t tell you how many inanimate objects have gotten the best of me.\n\nI can’t stop chuckling\n\nwhat a throw by the tree I felt like it was a WWE throw\n\nI’m glad OP is okay, but i can’t tell you the amount of times i watched this! Hahaha! A couple years ago i have the ring camera and my sister was coming over to visit me and she was walking up the steps and somehow her sandal completely slipped off her foot she fell right into the door the ring caught it all thankfully she was perfectly fine i think i needed help off the floor from laughing so hard 😂\n\nThe video kept auto-replaying so i just kept laughing. Rolling in endorphins atm.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pth2c8rgmwpd1.png?width=1283&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3ebea218edf753d6ba4c6f5bf58a1a77e51d128b\n\nLooks like he’s trying to break dance around the tree.\n\nTruly Olympian!\n\nMan in the Orange Shorts is our next Olympic Gold Medalist\n\n10/10 great form\n\nYou survived a head plant. I salute you.\n\nHA\n\nCTE from gardening. Dangerous game out there.\n\nThis reminded me to find the ring clip of my husband pulling a poplar shoot out of the lawn and doing the most cartoonish back somersault down the hill.\n\nGreat form but a little rough on the landing\n\nYou're a good sport   thanks for the laugh\n\nI love that there is a second before the fall and I could just feel that “shit, sh..”\n\nWith both his feet still walking in the air for a moment.  Classic\n\nLooks like you got the Ding camera off Temu 🤣🤣\n\n“Ding”🤣\n\nI almost peed myself laughing. Love how you expertly used your head to break your fall! \n\nHonestly though thanks for the laugh!\n\nIts easier to pull a hand cart over a transition than push it, for future trips\n\nI know this pain..... i did this taking a fridge off a truck once. Took me for a ride down the whole ramp\n\nWe call that a face plant.\n\n/angryupvote\n\nNow you'll have a great story to tell every time you see that tree.\n\nNever saw a tree use a judo throw.\n\nThis would hit on r/wellthatsucks 😂\n\nI laughed.  A lot.  Then I felt bad.  Then I felt better because I would’ve done the same exact thing.  Then I laughed again.  Then I realized, as guys, we really are idiots.  So I laughed again to hide the pain.\n\nI move pots with mine, so I have gotten into the habit of pulling it over grass as it feels less likely to lose the pot with a bump\n\ni would be caught between a rock (laughing uncontrollably) and a hard place (devastating worry for his head + spinal cord) if i saw my bf do this move bc /pulling/ the cart is what 1st comes to my mind with something this heavy over not-concrete. mainly because my upper-body strength is nil so pulling seems easier to handle. bless y’all, i admire the confidence that comes with overall higher physical ability and the “eh this’ll work out bc why wouldn’t it, send it” attitude 😂\n\nThis ride was wild.\n\nI’m just feeling glad I don’t have a ring camera on my back door- I hate to think of the gardening goofs it would catch!\n\nUs humans are laughing, the tree is barking 🤣🤣🤣🤣 Hoping your face is ok!\n\nHahaha!! I'm sorry, but this is something I would so do...\n\nAh, physics. You never let me down. It let you down, mind you 😉\n\nThe head plant with zero reactionary arm movements to save your face was impressive\n\nDude sacrificed his ego for the good of the sub 👍\n\nI hope you're ok...falls are no joke\n\nI am OK. Just scrapes and bruises luckily. Thank you for your concern.\n\nOh man, how's your neck? That was quite the face plant!\n\nMy neighbor did this today but with a full trash can.\n\nI tried to keep a straight face as i drove past when the trash cans wheels hit the grass and they face planted into the now sideways open trash can that spewed its contents all over them (either they had loose items or a trash bag burst.  Looked like the latter)\n\nI’m sorry this happened to you and I hope you’re okay , but damn that was funny right there\n\npulling instead of pushing will save you the pain\n\nI’m really glad you face planted in the grass and not a couple feet to the side! Ouch\n\nThis is an ad for Amazon’s camera\n\nRight in the mush.\n\nStubborn tree. ”I don’t want to be planted, leave me alone”\n\nThe tree totally stuck the landing.\n\nIf a man falls in the woods, does he make a sound? \nI guarantee it!!!! lol\n\nLet it be know THE TREE HAS CHOSEN ITS SPOT\n\nthank goodness ur knee landed on the grass and not concrete\n\nThe tree planted YOU!\n\nHa!\n\nYou win the thread\n\nyou almost paralyzed or killed possibly yourself trying to do something so innocuous like planting a lovely tree, my god im glad you’re okay and that we can giggle with you about this 😭😂 as an occasional window watcher i would’ve LOST my mind laughing over this and probably drop off a neck pillow + some icy hot for you poor dear\n\nMy man, the laughs and all are good - really good - but I hope you got yourself checked for concussion. \n\nThat’s some Chevy Chase stunts\n\nYou’re supposed to plant the tree, not your face!\n\nOh no, that's terrible! I hope the tree is okay!\n\nWell, next time you know to tie it to the top of your trolley. So you have both hands free for movement. We all make mistakes.\n\nSome real r/looneytuneslogic\n\nr/accidentalslapstick\n\nr/arborists\n\nYou should edit in some whimsical sound effects.\n\nLol thanks for posting iam not the only one hahahaha\n\nThe tree won and is still standing completely unscathed\n\nOh my. THANK YOU! I totally needed the giggles this morning\n\nScorpioned himself. This happens when catching an edge snowboarding . Except there is snow to catch your face\n\nI used to work in a nursery. Tree hooks are your friend\n\nMake sure to remove the burlap and pull it behind you next time not in front.\n\nAh, yes.  The old philosophical question: if a tree falls in the woods...wait...no...if the delivery guy with the tree falls on the lawn...won't get fooled again?\n\nInstructions unclear; instead of tree, planted face.\n\nI don't think that's how you dig a hole.\n\nThat redbud tossed you like a salad\n\nWicked\n\nThe walk motion as you're lifted in the air is what gets me.\n\nClassic organic farmer, planting his face.\n\nI did a similar maneuver using a refrigerator dolly to move stone. I filled a 20 gallon nursery pot with stone, and went to put it on the dolly to move it from a backyard it to the front. I didn't realize the front platform was propped up a few inches by the grass. So I plunked down this bucket of probably around 50 pounds, from a hunched over position as I was only moving it laterally one step. That levered the upper arm straight into the crown of my head, I had to take a moment there. Felt like I got hit by a hammer.\n\nQue Benny Hill music\n\nLOL.  Love it.  Thanks for sharing your goof.  If we can't laugh, we might as well not be here.\n\nI love that you’re the type of person to whom this happens and your instinct is to post it on Reddit. Bless the internet.\n\noof i felt that 😂\n\nI definitely would still be nursing my ego from the ground if that was me\n\nAre you in a radioactive zone\n\nPlease show us the head hole\n\nLooks like one of the silent film comedies with this filter lol\n\nNature wins again.\n\nOuch!\n\nIt’s okay. You live there now.\n\n😆\n\nhahaha and people say that gardening is easy 🤭🤭\n\nSomeone got planted.\n\nr/looneytuneslogic is calling!\n\nPhysics yo\n\nThis is glorious—thank you for sharing!\n\nI can’t stop watching this it’s hilarious\n\nLMAO\n\nIs the tree okey?\n\nWalking meme\n\nat least you didn’t break the tree\n\nPwned\n\nSomething was planted.\n\nAre you ok?!?!\n\nThank you, I was irritated before watching this but now I'm laughing \nSo sorry it happened though!!\n\nAt least the grass looks soft.\n\nBless you for sharing\n\nNo trees were injured making this film. On the other hand, humans injured, possibly 1.\n\nDid the tree just planted you?\n\nTrucked.\n\nI'm glad your tree is OK!\n\nI kind of love that feeling of being humbled. Lying on the ground feeling like and idiot but also laughing because life is funny.\n\nLooks like the B&amp;B that tripped you up.\n\nr/looneytuneslogic\n\nDid you survive or no?\n\nSend that to afv\n\nSmooth\n\nr/accidentalslapstick\n\nThe only thing you planted that day was your face.\n\nAt least you didn’t hit your head on a rock or pavement.\n\nKudos for self deprecation\n\nPull not push. You’ll remember next time… :)\n\nBackwards my dude, you have to go backwards over over transitions.\n\nDamn I hope you’re alright, you really did a number on your neck to say nothing of landing on your head.\n\nIt’s just as funny the 10th time watching as it is the 1st\n\nHell yeah\n\nWhew...the tree is fine!!😘🌳\n\n7/10\n\nHow adorable that you posted this.  You’re obvi very secure, have a great sense of humor, care about the environment and wanted to prove once and for all that you flunked Kindergarten Ballet because you couldn’t stand on one foot.  Seriously though, I hope you are ok.  You could have broken your neck.  Nice tree, don’t plant it anywhere near leeching fields, sewer pipes or water lines.  Best of luck, maybe some native ground cover next?\n\nMe on a Monday morning...\n\nDamn, I hope he’s ok\n\nExtra points for the camera effects\n\ncall that tree kayla harrison\n\nThe real issue is that the grass is lower than the driveway. You need to take the height differential into account.\nHe should have used a ramp.\n\nI believe that's the weight of the dirt that you underestimated, not the tree.\n\nWould your neighbor like some house to go with that garage?\n\nDidn’t think that one through, pal..  \n\nNow..  if only home videos were ever really funny..\n\nWhy are the gardens so boring"

OMW!!!\n\nGrab one of those old CD books from 90s-2000s to store seeds in, works great\n\nOMG THIS IS SO SMART OMG OMG OMG I THINK I HAVE ONE 💀\n\nWhat if each American landowner made it a goal to convert half of his or her lawn to productive native plant communities? Even moderate success could collectively restore some semblance of ecosystem function to more than twenty million acres of what is now ecological wasteland. How big is twenty million acres? It’s bigger than the combined areas of the Everglades, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Grand Teton, Canyonlands, Mount Rainier, North Cascades, Badlands, Olympic, Sequoia, Grand Canyon, Denali, and the Great Smoky Mountains National Parks. If we restore the ecosystem function of these twenty million acres, we can create this country’s largest park system.\n\nhttps://homegrownnationalpark.org/\n\nThis comment was edited with PowerDeleteSuite.

It’s on PlayStation right?\n\nI am on PC. \nits on PS4, Switch, Mobile also i think. You could get hooked, be warned.\n\nI honestly haven’t had time to game since moving to the farm so probably for the best 😮‍💨 I’ll check it out if there’s ever a slow day on the farm ;)\n\nCongrats. What kind of farm are you on. Will seeds be planted there\n\nIt’s just a 5 acre family farm. There’s 100+ avocado trees, citrus/peach/fig trees, pumpkins, squash, raised beds, chickens, papaya, passionfruit, guava, mango, bamboo, and I’m getting into more flowers too. So far my two favorite things have been sunflowers and pumpkins but I’m excited to try to grow EVERYTHING\n\n“Just a family farm” \n\nSounds so awesome! That’s a slice of heaven you got there\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qzykekew4ozd1.jpeg?width=960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a0bc3c84bf72108a4f19d5b2f5daf643408e4f2b\n\nMy mom and I think so 🥰 thank you 🙏\n\nWhat a chiller\n\nHahaha that’s hilarious she has ZERO chill\n\n[deleted]\n\nOMG hiii I LOVE sunflowers. It’s the first thing I planted on my farm! The red ones I’ve noticed are more fussy but I got some really pretty ones and will be planting probably 3x more red ones next year. I like the mammoth giant single head ones too. Actually I love all the sunflowers haha they’re all so pretty and I love looking over my yard and seeing a big bright pop of color from them high up 🥰\n\nShow me your sunflowers!! I planted a bunch of red velvet\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p1aul65bzozd1.jpeg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a0a8a4da14fe8b9d157d1415366e76c4d21ab40\n\nWow that’s so many things you can grow on this farm. What a wonderful place this must be. Dan Diego is crazy expensive and so many people want to live there. Glad you have such a slice of paradise on this farm and can get things on sale in such an expensive area. Great pic of you and your mom.  You both look so happy there. Have you considered any farm animals.\n\nAww thanks what a nice message I really appreciate you saying that! Ya I wake up and feel like the luckiest girl in the world every day I’m truly so grateful to be able to do this. I don’t take a day for granted. My parents are loving having “my energy” on the farm and are happy 1 of the 3 kids has taken an interest ;) gardening and farming and living this kind of lifestyle has given me an incredible amount of satisfaction, purpose, happiness, joy and most of all peace. My 20s were fun at times and really sad at other times and it’s nice to finally be in a place where I feel like I’m EXACTLY where I’m meant to be and it feels really good being surrounded by family in a community I love 😊 I used to stream Fortnite on twitch for 2 years and live in the city. Now I teach preschool at my local church and play in my garden all day 😂 🤷🏼‍♀️ so I hope if you garden or do anything you’re passionate about you feel that to some degree in your life too🤍 \n\nAnd yes! I do have farm animals I have 7 old hens who stopped laying this summer and are now in retirement kicking up dirt under the avocado trees. I’ll get a new flock in march or April and integrate the 7 old girls with them so they can show them the ropes of the farm and meet one another ;) it’ll be super cute I’m very excited for that. \n\nI’m excited for everything on the farm. Today I worked on irrigation for 5 hours and it was legitimately fun. I find everything’s rewarding so it doesn’t even seem upsetting unless it’s a gopher issue 😡\n\nThank you for the message. You have such a wonderful attitude kindness and healthy approach to life about you. You’re so grateful for all the little things in life. What did the two other kids do for work. Do they still come around to farm for good quality vegetables and to see the animals and maybe family too. What did you do for work in the city? So glad you found inner peace. Those toddlers are lucky to have you as a role model. Kids usually are exciting about farming as a different way of life, at least as tiny tots. \n\nIrrigation sounds fun. Guess you have a water tube system to water everything. Hope you’re not still in a drought. What have you named the chickens?  At what point do chickens stop being able to produce chicks and just lay eggs. Seems like so many are still laying on eggs thinking a chick baby will come out when it’s only a future scrambled egg!\n\nYour parents must be so proud of you. Not chasing after a high paying job and fancy clothes and cars etc. \n\nAre you close enough to mexico to visit and have you incorporated any influences from them on the farm. Maybe they have special vegetables or methods for farming.\n\nPumpkins and sunflowers, those are my two favorites in stardew valley 🤣 I think you really need to play !!\n\nHahaha are those two really your favorite too 😂 you have no idea how many people tell me I’m like star dew valley IRL\n\nYes they’re the best crops they sell for a lot, and sunflowers can be turned into oil 🤣\n\nLiving my dreams over there. Are you in the us??\n\nNeverMind just saw it says San Diego lol\n\nMobile might be the best format then.\n\nIts also included with Apple Arcade. I play it on my iPad for free and its a blast\n\nOh my gosh. I am a 42 year old woman who is a freak for Fortnite. I was quite the gamer when I was a kid, was a triple threat playing rock band on the Xbox in my early 30s and now have moved to Fortnite to play with my son (but play so much when he isn’t around) No shame for the games GIRL!!!\n\nI’ll raise you one… I used to stream Fortnite on twitch 💀 my chat never clipped me doing anything cool so I’ll spare you the montage to lil mosey \n\nHey what’s up you guys welcome BACK to another episode where today twinkle is going to play random duos with an 8 year old in Egypt with a terrible mic who will also steal ALL HER JUICY LOOT. Will she reach top 10 stick around folks 👋(spoiler: the kid lags out top 3 while we are in a 1x1 dead center with height &amp; we get 2nd) 🥈 \n\nYou gotta add me!!! I don’t stream anymore (no time with farm) but we would have so much fun playing duos 🥰\n\nDid we just become best friends??!!?!! I am American but live in Denmark now (moved here from San Diego!!) so the time difference will suck, but add me!  Onlineozzy0512\n\nOmg 😂 YES\n\n[deleted]\n\n[removed]\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jl2bfsbyrnzd1.jpeg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c7a619c21009148c3d2f9fa1ce2d7c969bb339a4\n\nI’m working on it! 🤞\n\nBeautiful!!\n\nAww thanks!!\n\nI have a nice garden, but I’m extremely jealous of yer shih tzu!!\n\nHave you ever seen EpicGardening on Instagram? He's in San Diego also with a beautiful garden. Lots of great ideas on his account!\n\nI don’t have insta! I’ll look them up tho :)\n\nAwesome score! I actually used to work for Livingston seed in Columbus Ohio. Super cool place that had an extraordinary amount of variety.\n\nI even helped build those racks!\n\nOMG STAWWWHP I LOVE THAT! \n\n🙏 thats actually so cool 😂\n\ndo this package seeds grow? i have bad memories of being a kind trying to grow strawberries or violets out of package seeds and not getting a single leafling out of them\n\nOh bummer! Ya I’ve had great success with seed packets. I’d say make sure to never get them wet and follow instructions on back!\n\nI've read that strawberries are notoriously hard to grow from seed. I generally have good luck with most seeds but I planted 30 strawberry seeds a couple years ago and got 2 plants. Now I know to just buy young strawberry plants at the garden center.\n\nSimilar experience here, started from seed, had about 12 plants and only one survived. Thinking of all that water and time could've went to my tomatoes and cucumbers.\n\nSo have you been avoiding seeds in a package since then?\n\njust came to say that your dogs are too sweet\n\nOmg I kept looking for your comment to respond and properly thank you for noticing my good shihtzu helping me with my seeds!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vg4ppsyaapzd1.jpeg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=266ce7cd13148647375989f96bc0b082c035bc9e\n\nThis is baba and guy. They’re reeeeeaaaallly helpful ;)\n\nawesome. sorry i like them more than seeds ❤️\n\nHahaha thanks ok! I love both and happy to share ;)\n\nMy little shih tzu would have grabbed a packet or two and played \"keep away\" with me.  Yours were very helpful,  I'm impressed!!\n\nHahahaha ya that’s EXACTLY what I was afraid of 😂 naughty shihtzus wanna play\n\nThis is so adorable and awesome\n\nAww thanks honestly it feels like Christmas morning and I’m 8 years old. I haven’t been this excited about something in so long 😅\n\n[removed]\n\nI was going to ask you to courier me!!\n\n\nThen i converted usd to my local currency and realised that i would get more than necessary seeds with the same amount 😅\n\nThe high end gords/squash/pumpkins I got for 25¢ I was looking at online for $12…\n\nI can’t even explain how much money this would’ve cost me full retail … well over $500\n\nI tried seeds again this year and they did the best. Even the super nice plants I bought, my transplants completely caught up and over took them! I bought a big binder and clear seed pages. Never knew they made em. I'm so excited to start from seed again this year. Congrats on the great haul!\n\nThanks! Ya I’ve had the most success with seeds here in zone 10. I’ve got great rich fluffy soil that drains well and full of chicken poo and compost ;)  I just use my cultivator and fluff it before I plant and usually I’ll soak seeds for an hour to overnight to help as well. I pay attention to temperatures more now and READ THE BACK 😅 I was more Willy Nilly when I first moved to the farm but certain things require certain conditions so I’ve tried sticking to the back of the packets more which is fun 🤷🏼‍♀️ \n\nWhat are you looking forward to growing the most? Or what’s your favorite? Do a flower and veggie ;) I know it’s hard to choose\n\nI'm looking forward to trying to grow luffas, gourds, and potatoes this year. I've never tried those at all. Tomatoes are my big crop! I want to plant a bunch of fruit trees... But they're expensive! Any tips on that?\n\nEverything’s expensive for farming tbh haha I’m asking everyone in my family for trees for Christmas.\n\nI have a ton of tomatoes but I don’t eat them so I don’t really like growing them 😂 or eating them. I’ve got a bunch of citrus, fig, pomegranate and avo. I’d say fertilizer and lots of water. Also be constantly trapping and monitoring gophers. Track the weather constantly and the soil to adjust the water for the week. Proper irrigation is important. I put sunscreen on my baby trees through the summer since I’m in San Diego and it got HOT this September\n\nAll of this is going to depend on your zone tbh where are you located?\n\nHere’s one of my pomegranate trees they’re going nuts right now I am setting up a stand this weekend to sell them\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1emmywdhaozd1.jpeg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d525ef66f1102c5f002e02d13dde098e521a6486\n\n7A here, gotta find out the best natives\n\nI use photo albums to store my seed packets. I have had good luck in picking up new albums with the plastic inserts at thrift stores.\n\nCVS sells seeds, apparently!\n\nThose dogs are totally thinking “are we still going to have money for treats?” 🤣 you could set up your own seed bank like the one in Svalbard.\n\nHahahaha omg the dogs 😂 they were thinking their butts would feel great on top of them 🙄 I quickly repacked them \n\nMy precious seeds ;)\n\nI would have picked up the stand, carried it entirely to the cash register, looked at the cashier, and said \"gimmie\"\n\nOMG I DIDNT EVEN THINK OF THAT\n\nGenius.\n\nAll the eggs and bacon you have.\n\nGirl what store is this???\n\nIt’s called zamzows I don’t have them in San Diego but there were a few in Idaho I checked out. Only one location had seeds still (well DID have seeds hehe) and all the other garden stores in the area were empty and some were full price I’m like 🤨 it’s snowing haha but 🤷🏼‍♀️ lucky AF\n\nI don’t like there but I’ll see if my state has any.. never heard of that store. Thanks for getting back to me!\n\nYa of course! I would check your local gardening stores that are major chains. The boutique/organic/mom &amp; pop will hold onto their seeds multiple years and seasons. The larger corporate chains will be trying to unload excess inventory \n\nHope that helps! Happy seed hunting 🥰\n\nThank you, and you too! Sadly we don’t have a zamzow but I get paid today.. after work I’ll do some running around. :) happy hunting friend!\n\nWow, your garden must be maasive.\n\n5 acres but not all of that is farming land. I actually need to figure that out today. \n\nI just expanded my fenced off winter garden and tripled the size\n\nI’ve got 4 raised beds up by the potting/seed station/chicken coop\n\n2 giant fields on each side of the main house so I honestly don’t know how to get exact measurements but ill try my best to get that measured out today\n\nWow you hit the jackpot! Enjoy!!\n\nOmg thank you 😊 it’s the jackpot of my lifetime there’s no way I’ll ever have this happen again and I’m so glad (mostly) everyone here shares my excitement ;)\n\nI wish stores here would discount seeds at the end of the year. Instead they just throw them into the trash and write it off as a business loss or something :( \n\nAs for seed storage, I remember people taking photo albums and placing seed packets into it instead of photos, and it was very neat and organized!\n\nCleaned out Pierre!\n\n🫡\n\nI saw further down you don't know stardew. Pierre is the owner of the shop, he is who sells you seeds, for context. Jealous of your green thumb! I have one peach tree!\n\nOh haha I thought Pierre was another location of this garden chain haha 😅 \n\nOmg I’ve got ONE peach tree too and the rats enjoyed it the most this year 🙄 I got about 2 dozen… that’s a whole other story\n\nBugs are our problem. We've only bought the property 2 years ago but both years we've only managed a handful of peaches that aren't demolished by bugs.\n\nOh interesting what kind of bugs? Where are you located? I’m in San Diego and we don’t really have any bugs besides these stupid white butterflies that DECIMATE my artichokes and broccoli oh and some hornworms took out 3 tomatoes but nothing too bad.  Are you organic? I feel like the trade off is worth it like ya it’s ok nature gets some stuff too\n\nExcept gophers I can’t stand them\n\nIn south central Kansas, and it's my only fruiting plant, so I'm not really a farmer. Not sure what kind of bugs, but haven't really looked into it either. Hoping to learn a bit about preventatives this winter and have a plan come spring time. Would love to plant a few other fruits but not until I figure out what the heck I'm doing\n\nWay to go, girl! You scored a great deal on those seeds.\n\nThank you!!!\n\nOmg jealous!! Congrats on your haul!!\n\nThank you 😘 I love your username I wish I could get some to grow haha spring ;)\n\nThank you!!\n\nI love this and love the photo! This is like something that I would do and be so excited over!\n\nMe running to plant the whole neighborhood with 25¢ seeds. Goals! 🌱\n\nYes! Everyone’s getting seeds for Christmas! \n\nI teach preschool so a lot of these will be going to the education of the next generation of gardeners and farmers in my local community 🥰\n\nI’ve got you beat! 😂 my work let us take leftover seeds as we transitioned out of the season. Greatest day ever! I easily have about 400 packs. So excited for spring already 🥰\n\nA few years back, I was at Wal-Mart the day after Thanksgiving. \n\nI was in produce, where they put up a sign... 1 Cent Each.\n\nIt was three ears of decorative corn on the cob for 1 cent. I bought the entire table full for $0.85. ( yes 3x85 )\n\nI was feeding Squirrels and Crows all winter long.\n\nYou may have a beautiful garden\n\nThat looks like so much fun\n\nAww thanks it was! Such a lucky find and totally unexpected 🥰 \n\nWho doesn’t love a good SALE 🤷🏼‍♀️ ;)\n\nI thought the fourth photo was you calling all of your friends and family to ask what they want as well lol excellent find and awesome haul!\n\nOh everyone’s getting seeds for Christmas ;) but no that’s just me getting all my hair out of the way to properly see the selection 🤭\n\nShout out Howard Dill\n\nSCORE🤘. Nice haul!\n\nThank you omg I’m so excited I’m so happy everyone gets it 😭\n\nIn the future you can harvest most of those for free. Also, check your local library. Some libraries have free seed programs during planting seasons. Either way, You can winterize everything in your fridge and start to stagger planting.\n\nI have never seen anyone buy that many seeds so not sure what your planting game-plan is. With that many items just make sure you know what can and cannot be neighboring plants.\n\nHey welcome to Boise!! Glad you found Zamzows\n\nOMG DO YOU LIVE IN BOISE?!? \n\nCan I talk to you about the biggest gardening scam in that town??\n\nNORTH END NURSERY\n-not in north end\n-rudest laziest employees\n-terrible selection\n-expensive AF $$$$\n\nHave you been to Edward’s greenhouse though!!\n\n👀 no…. Do tell\n\nMe too....I end up feeding them to birds. They go bad before I can use them.\n\nAt the end of the season my work gives em away for free. They come in as a pay per scan and then get told to just toss em so my boss just sets buckets out and tells people to take what they can use\n\nNice to see a fellow skier staying outside! I too found farm life to line up. :)\n\nI have a little drinks fridge that I use to store seeds. They will stay viable for many extra years if stored cool. Even seeds like parsnip which are supposed to expire after a year have stayed good for 4 years for me when kept in the seed fridge. It really helps to spin out the seed lifetimes.\n\nThis is how I roll. Don't always get everything I want but usually get most of it and some new things.\n\nI like how you roll 😎 sale things are still new things to me \n🙃\nIt wouldn’t be fair if we got everrrrrything we want\n\nI do long-term storage in mason jars.  Nice haul!\n\nOmg of course I have a million of those! And I haven’t learned canning yet so 😅 they’re ready to use OMG WHAT A CUTE WAY TO STORE THEM\n\nI bought a lot of seeds in the past and 2 years later I found some molding inside their paper bags so the next time around I put the packets into a dehidrator at low temp for a couple of hours then stored them in plastic tubes such as these ones. I have hundreds of these tubes with seeds and they all store really well:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pzhfo6z71rzd1.jpeg?width=2450&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2293134ecf3dee4c654deee3f208991e4c78b3be\n\n[deleted]\n\nIm so jealous!!!! Happy for you tho!!!!!\n\nWow 475 without the discount.. I can’t believe they were that high. \n I’ve never seen them for more than  50c a piece. Usually less. That’s Crazy crazy.\n\n[removed]\n\nThis might be a silly question, I simply do not know, but, don't seeds \"expire\"? As in, eventually after having them in storage for a while, doesn't the chance to sprout go down? I might be wrong but that's what I've heard. I hope I'm either wrong or you have a garden that's big enough to plant all this stuff sometime soon though! Great score.\n\nYou’re a goddamn lunatic…. …also I have very much been that goddamn lunatic 🤣\n\nDamn! So jealous. This was my second year trying out gardening. First year nothing grew, this year everything grew then the deer ate them. Next year who knows!\n\nNooo the deer 😡 \nWhere do you live? What’s been the most successful (until the deer)\n\nDo seeds go bad? Or as long as there dry they stay good  and will last forever?\n\nI can just see you walking past that carousel and doing a double take 😂😂😂\n\nLOL you collect seeds like I collect vinyl records. I love it.\n\nBless your little heart! \nEnjoy your seeds...\nYou go girl! 😂 💕 🤗\np.s.\n(envy here)\n\nZamzows is a fantastic local company. I go there all the time! Glad you found a steal!\n\nWhere?  Looks like Lowe’s or Home Depot\n\nHD\n\nThanks\nMuch!\n\nSeeds -- gateway drug to gardening.\n\nno truer statement on this gardening sub has ever been spoken. That’s how it all started 😅\n\nMoney well spent\n\nOhhhh HECK YES! bout to do some biodiverse-style gardening??\n\nI'm jealous. See hoarders unite.\n\nI love this for you.\n\nAwesome!! So happy for you!\n\nThank you for posting this! I was finally able to show my husband proof that I'm not the world's MOST obsessed seed collector. ;)\n\nHahahaha my pleasure 🫡 he should see my house I have seeds drying everywhere. Hoarding jars and containers ALSO FOR THE SEED HOARDING. it’s a slippppppery slope and I’m off the deep end 😇 I’m sorry you have to take 2nd for this award 🥈;)\n\nRemembering when seeds were always 25 cents… 😂\n\nThis reminds me of going to the grocery store to get items on a really good sale for my weekly list to balance the budget. Only to find out that they have been wiped out.\n\nHehe 🙃 the manager said they’ve been sitting there on sale for weeks in my defense *nervous laugh*\n\nDo seeds have an expiration date? I’d love to stock up like this, but I feel like I’d never get to everything before they expired\n\nHuge score!\n\nShe has many seeds!!\n\nLol 😍\n\nI once hit the hardware store on the day seeds were priced at a nickel per packet; I took every single one they had. I tried to convince the checkout girl: \"Let's just call it ten bucks, shall we? And make things simple?\" but NOOOO, she had to ring up every single nickel item. It took ten minutes and came out to $9.50\n\nAnother time I hit a garage sale and evidently someone worked at the local greenhouse and had a HUGE big of seed packets (from the previous year) they were selling at 10 cents each. I bought a few, but returned the following day just as they were packing everything up. \"I'll give you ten bucks for all the rest of the seeds in that bin\" and that worked out to about a penny per packet.\n\nAt that point the whole block gonna look real nice next year\n\nDang, I'm also in San Diego and was going to ask where the sale was until I reread the post.  Nice find!!!\n\nthis makes me want to become a farmer\n\nThat's amazing\n\nCongratulations! \nI was also lucky enough to catch seeds on sale at Lowe’s for .25¢ and I went ham! \n\nI started a seed library in my neighborhood, kinda like a little free library where you come swap out some seeds or plant starts and it’s been wonderful! So many of us are turning our lawns in food areas / pollinator gardens. \n\nAlso I LOVED organizing them. If you’ve ever ordered seeds from botanical interest, the boxes they ship them in are ✨perfect✨ for storing seeds. Happy gardening!\n\nLooks like you bought 5 packs at CVS\n\nI had to pop in our local dollar store on the way home for last minute milk and they had seed packets for .06. You betcha I bought them all.\n\nNot the dogs for scale 🤣\n\nScore of a lifetime 🙌🏼\n\nYay YOU!!\n\nThank god you didn’t buy them at a CVS. Would have caused a world paper shortage.\n\nNiiiiiice, lucky, and love yer little dog there !!\n\nGood haul.\n\nThat’s awesome.   Wish I could find them deals.  Lmao 🤣.   Great job.\n\ndream 🤤🚀\n\nFellow zone 10er here and wow wow I am thrilled for you!!!\n\nI'm envious. \n\nWallmart gave them away back in spring..12 per person\n\nThis was me earlier today with bulbs 😂\n\nI love your excitement for gardening. You really love it 💕\n\nKeep them cool and dry in a dark cabinet and they’ll last years!\n\nShould hand them out on Halloween\n\nI store mine in a big three ring photo album binder. \n\nCome on over to r/seedswap we’d love to have you!!\n\n[removed]\n\nIM SOOO JEALOUSSSS\n\nI did the same at Dollar General 10/29/24. Most packets were 17cents some were 7 cents each. Then we handed them out during Halloween. The kids LOVED it. Some kids remembered from last year and decide to make request or said can I change this for punk in seeds instead of flowers 😊. My way of introducing kids to gardening and not cavities\n\nWow! What a haul!"

    "all_comment_text": "I never really appreciated dahlias before seeing so many on Reddit last year and this but, YOWZA!  They are just extraordinary!  I wish I had even a little garden so I could grow them.\n\nThank you! 🥰 They can grow in pots too as long as you have a place for them with full sun!\n\n[deleted]\n\nDo you have to dig them out each year?\n\nIs this due to frost or does any climate have to do this?\n\nDahlias are hardy to zones 8-10. However, I am in zone 6 and forgot one over the winter that thrived and was blooming earlier than any of my other dahlias this year. It was in a warm spot, relative.\n\nThank you! \n\nWhat happens if you’re in zone 11b? Does it get too hot and you have to dig it out too?\n\nGood question, another google search tells me that zone 11 is fine but much further, I can't find any info. I think they'd probably really struggle in the summer in, say, zone 13.\n\nThanks for responding! My local resources don’t have a lot of info on flowers so it really helps! \n\nSo grateful for UF’s IFAS program because what works for my area is generally the opposite of what I’m reading everywhere else and I would be lost without them. Flowers they have less info on so your opinion really helps! \n\nI didn’t discover them until I watched the summer take crop after crop from me. Looking forward to ending my first year gardening on a high note!\n\n[deleted]\n\nThis sounds lovely. I live in 11b, I wonder if they could take the heat and rain we have.\n\n[deleted]\n\nThank you much!\n\nJust laid down 2500 # of pre-composted local mulch and I’m beat! \n\nToday is mostly for planning the garden and reading in bed.\n\nUnless you have chipmunks\n\nGorgeous! Was the eucalyptus difficult to grow?\n\nIt grew well for me! Just slow. I started those seeds indoors in January 😮\n\nWhat’s your zone?\n\nThose dahlias are stunning! Beautiful colors together.\n\nBeen a while since ive seen a fully grown table\n\nGrowing a tree for the table is certainly possible but growing drywall - that takes talent.\n\nCame here looking for this joke. Thanks for making it internet stranger.\n\nCame here to say this. Thank you good sir\n\nGorgeous!\n\nHow do you get the eucalyptus to survive? I’ve tried twice and it died both times.\n\nI want this to be my wedding bouquet. Stunning!\n\nSo beautiful! And the arrangement is gorgeous ☺️💖\n\nAbsolutely beautiful\n\nI aspire to be like you! Planting from seed is next level gardener. This is lovely. Good on you!\n\nOmg I would be so proud of myself these are beautiful! Those flowers were grown with love and magic omggg😭😭\n\nThey really were 🥲😅 I absolutely love starting seeds and tubers. I started all of the tubers indoors in pots on racks in March and would get up every morning to run to check if any had sprouted through the soil. It's so exciting!!\n\nCongratulations! Great selection, color combo, and with out blemish. Wow!\nFabulous\n\nThank you for noticing! I cover every one of my dahlia buds with an organza bag so the bugs don't much on the petals. It's a lot of extra work but worth it! 😅\n\nVery very smart! Doing anything else may have damaged the peddles. Hats off to you! Remarkable\n\nCan we see what the eucalyptus looks like now? Did it shrub or tree? I’ve always wanted one but I only ever see the eucalyptus with the long thin leaves that don’t have the same aroma that I’ve noticed. \n\nThere's nothing really to show now, I've cut almost all of it at this point. It's an annual here in upstate NY. It has an amazing smell! https://www.johnnyseeds.com/flowers/eucalyptus/silver-dollar-eucalyptus-seed-1509.11.html\n\nThank you! Interesting it’s kept as an annual. I wonder if I could keep it indoors and keep it alive.\n\nMy understanding is it doesn't like to be root bound or it's roots disturbed, so I am guessing probably not 😕\n\nFascinating. I've never heard of a gum being an annual, but I guess it makes sense for ones growing in cold climates. \n\nThat’s so beautiful!!\n\nLove them\n\nSo pretty!\n\nLovely!! Congrats!\n\nThat must be a pretty great feeling. Good on ya 😁\n\nThey’re all perfect! 🤩\n\nThe lighting is immaculate as well.\n\nThis is absolutely beautiful\n\nOMG BEAUTIFUL!!!! Wow that’s stunning you should sell those arrangements or do weddings!\n\nBeautiful! Amazing job\n\nAwesome💜💚💙\n\nThey are gorgeous. You did an amazing job!\n\nStunning!\n\nSo beautiful\n\n❤️\n\nThis is beautiful, both in presentation and story ♥️ well done!\n\nSo beautiful\n\nBeautiful\n\nThat is absolutely fabulous\n\nCan I say DAMN? 😍😍😍😍\n\nBeautiful work! I love it❤️\n\nKudos that’s amazing 😻\n\nWhat’s your tips on eucalyptus??\n\nThat is awesome!\n\nSo beautiful 🤩\n\nThis is a stunning display, two thumbs all the way up.\n\nSo dreamy 😍\n\nWhere did you get your dahlia seeds? The plants I’ve grown from seeds always give me either pompoms or single dahlias\n\nThe dahlias are all grown from tubers! I don't bother with dahlia seeds for exactly that reason\n\nIt's so pretty!!\n\nSo I tried growing Eucalyptus lemon bush from a  packet that I bought.    The instructions said grow in dry pellets  and mix with water..  I was so surprised that not only did I get  two  plants  but they were healthy and thriving.  Then when  I transferred into  pot with some real dirt, they  shriveled and died.  I also had  placed it outside in hot Florida sun in wet season too. What gives.  I gave it sun and water.  Lol.  Looks like Op has a gift!!   Im so impress!    Your so talented Op!\n\nEucalyptus by seed! Impressive!\n\nGorgeous 😍!! Nice work!\n\nWow😍 congrats OP..\n\nSo pretty wow\n\nGreat job!!\n\nIt is beautiful you should be proud of yourself\n\nIf I grew these, my heart would overflow with joy every time I looked at them!\n\nWhat a beautiful bouquet ❤️❤️ thank you and great work!!\n\nOh my god it’s beautiful 😍 \n\nSo very Well done gardener! You should be very proud 🫶🏾\n\nThank you!!! 🥹🥹🥹\n\nWow!!!!! Someday I hope to do the same!! I currently have three little baby eucalyptus and can’t wait to use them. Great job!!!!!!\n\nLooks beautiful. Great job!\n\nThats friggin amazing\n\nWOW!!!\n\nImpressive! I love Zinnia’s they are so pretty\n\nThere's only 1 zinnia and a few cosmos, the rest are all dahlias!\n\nI am going to have to try growing dahlias. I just hate having to dig them up and replant them here in Montana. Can you grow them in containers?\n\nAbsolutely! The bigger the container the better, but I've also successfully seen blooms out of a container as small as a 1 gallon pot. Just be sure to pinch after 3-4 leaf sets so it branches out and doesn't become top heavy.\n\nThx\n\nGorgeous. Congratulations\n\nThat’s beautiful\n\nThis legit looks like a professionally made wedding bouquet! Although, I may be biased, because I had eucalyptus exactly like that in mine. It never occurred to me to try and grow it though, I'll have to give that a shot!\n\nSo these are Dahlias not Zinnia’s?\n\nYes there is only 1 zinnia (sticking up out of the top)"

Maybe you can spare a few for an experiment to see how this variety holds up? \n\nJalapeño jelly is delicious for those who don't know. The spice is really cut by the sugar and you just have a great jalapeño taste that you can put on toast for a tasty snack or breakfast.\n\nOh I love it Poured over cream cheese.\n\nThis.\n\nPour it over a brick of cream cheese, use a Triscuit to scoop.\n\nI think I need to go to the store now...\n\nCream cheese and jelly on a bagel might work too\n\nOr sourdough toast\n\nOoh, yes. Or a dense seedy rye. Little arugula on top. Maybe a fried egg.\n\nSTOP ALREADY!! 😂 🤣🤣\n\nThere nothing better than a mutton, lettuce, and tomato sandwich. Especially when the mutton is nice and lean. They're so perky.\n\nGreat Princess Bride reference.

This is my family's favorite appetizer\n\nNow I’m hungry and it’s 1130pm!!! Thank you!! Lol 😂\n\nFabulous in baked Brie as well.\n\nI am pregnant and what to eat this so badly that tears are forming in my eyes.\n\nI wish I could eat things while pregnant again. It was like everything was just so delicious. Food never tasted better.\n\nOh my god I ate lunch at this chain called Macheesmo Mouse every day of my pregnancy and it tasted like nothing ever before or since. I have eaten some amazing meals but something about the way that mall Mexican food hit was just surreal\n\nIt is an old wives tale that peppers make for early delivery. By 9.25 months, every mother to be is chomping on peppers\n\nOh, that’s not the thing preventing me from devouring habanero jelly baked in Brie.\n\nWhat’s preventing me from eating it is I don’t own either of these things and live in a tiny town that probably won’t provide habanero jelly D:\n\nI second this, brie and a spicy jelly are a match made in heaven.\n\nOooh.  That sounds delicious.\n\nGoat cheese and crackers and this alllll day long\n\nGreat Christmas gift. 👍\n\nOver cornbread is my go-to\n\nI love it on a biscuit with a good ol' slice of American cheese. Sounds weird, absolutely slaps\n\nPepper jam of my kind is great on a breakfast sandwich. \n\nToasted English muffin slathered with butter and jalapeño jam, a healthy schmear of avocado, breakfast meat of your choice, and an over-easy egg. Breakfast of champions.\n\nscotch bonnets and habaneros also make delicious jam. i really enjoy it cut 50/50 with any cane berry. raspberry and scotch bonnet jam with mascarpone or cream cheese on crostini is sensational.\n\nMy grandad used to do pepper jelly with cream cheese on ritz crackers. Very 1960s fancy snack!\n\nI love it on Italian sausages\n\nI make a habanero mango jam that really blows peoples' minds with how flavorful it is, and it's not too hot since I don't use the placenta or seeds in it.\n\nYou are so right. I made Biker Billy jelly for years. I couldn't go to my nephew's for Christmas without a couple jars. 😀\n\nI love making jalapeño jelly! I made habanero jelly last year and the flavor was amazing. I used too many habaneros and it was incredibly hot, but my spice-loving friends and family loved it.\n\nDo have a recipe you would share? I've always wanted to try and I have a LOT of jalapeños this year.\n\n[https://www.ballmasonjars.com/blog?cid=jalapeno-jelly-0](https://www.ballmasonjars.com/blog?cid=jalapeno-jelly-0)\n\nI was introduced to jalapeño jelly a few years ago and it was pretty life changing. lol\n\nhah i could spare a lot. cowboy candy does sound fun tho. although it would be really hot with these.\n\nYeeeaaaaahhhh, those look significantly hotter than jalapeños\n\nOh yes. Too hot for me! \n\nThose are chemical weapon hot peppers.  The only thing to do is punish people with unholy hot sauce.\n\nOr bring them into work and challenge the guys to eat them on Friday, as they apparently do with my husband's workplace. I'm sending him in with birds eye chilies this week, not AS hot but still a fun after work activity.\n\nMango jalapeño glaze isn't hot at all.\n\n OP's peppers aren't  jalapeños. They look more like scotch bonnets....way way more hot???\n\nI have no advice, I just want to highlight their user name that clearly shows this pepper madness was the plan all along\n\nhehe i always grow too much tho. suffering from success.\n\nDehydrate them, grind them to powder then keep a stash in your pocket.  Use it as an attacker deterrent.\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/9bf6n87k2mod1.gif\n\nYou're the best\n\nI know how that started; \"I should start a few more in case some of them die\" and then you don't have the heart to sacrifice any seedlings\n\nDon't call me out like that. Just started recently and i had intially planned for two plants. Now i have 8 bell peppers, 8 habaneros and 8 jalapenos cause i couldnt toss away the seedlings.\n\nI'm just as bad. I don't need 25 zinnias, but they are all doing so well! And it's an excuse to build another container\n\nI did that with sweet potatoes. 15 bushels is hard to eat, really\n\nCan I just say. I’ve never grown sweet potatoes but had a few sprouting so I threw em in an old raised bed filled with dirt I never use. And then they grew these really long, I mean REALLY long vines, and I saw the vines were trying to root in some spots, so I strung the vines across a long low pot I have. For science. But then I read that the vines won’t grow a potato simply from rooting in the dirt, so I snipped the vines halfway in the pot. Just been ignoring them, flicking off the snails when they get too greedy. \n\nThen a couple of days ago I notice a fking SWEET POTATO POPPING OUT OF THE DIRT!! The dirt that was nothing but vines and dirt, a sweet potato!!! I can’t believe it worked. \n\nAlso I have hella sweet potato questions if you’re feeling knowledgeable\n\nBtw.. those sweet potato leaves are more nutritious than the actual sweet potatoes. Snip off the smaller tender ones to cook like spinach or harvest the big ones to stuff or dehydrated and powdered to add to green smoothies and broths, scrambled eggs, ect.\n\nThats alright. Just load em up in the impala and share them at your next insane clown posse show\n\nSell to a local restaurant  🤷🏽‍♀️.\n\nthatd be cool. i just walk in there with peppers? 😅\n\nI've been doing direct to restaurant sales for 15 years now. \n\nCall and talk to the head chef first. Let them know you'd like to come in and bring some peppers for them to check out. \n\nAsk if the time between lunch and dinner rush (1:30-3:30 pm) is okay, and choose a 30-minute block in that time span to meet at the restaurant.\n\nAre there any licenses or certs you need? I grow food for my family and I have a friend that owns a restaurant and he told me he wouldn’t buy from a local grower unless they were licensed. I emailed my states dept of agriculture for more info but never got a reply.\n\nI've never had a restaurant ask for a license. TBH, the license itself doesn't mean anything since you're selling bulk unprocessed produce. Insurance would be useful, but the license itself is basically worthless. You don't even need one if you're selling under $7,500 per year. You can just claim it on taxes using your SSN. \n\nYou can't get a safety inspection for local sales of bulk unprocessed produce, so I'm not even sure what your friend thinks the license says. You can't get an inspection for whole produce until you need a USDA GAP certificate to sell to wholesalers like Sysco or Gordon Foods for interstate commerce. There's not even a list of regulations like there would be for a restaurant. When an inspector goes to a restaurant, they have a list of things they need to check, but such a list doesn't exist for a local ag producer. \n\nIf I'm being honest, your friend sounds like a combination of really clueless and highly confident when it comes to farming regulations. You meet people like that all. the. time. as a farmer. \n\nI have some idiot try and tell me how it works almost every week at farmers markets. Usually, they're trying to say it's fully cool to have farm visitors when the Food Safety Modernization Act 2019 banned untrained visitors in production areas. I do mushrooms, so everyone thinks they're entitled to come and see my operation and have me teach them so they can open a competing farm.\n\nThank you for all this info. I’d guess it’s more on the clueless side. His reasoning was covering his ass in case of someone getting sick. He’s been the only person I’ve talked to about it and I plan on contacting more local restaurant owners. Hopefully I don’t get the same type of response. I live in a small town that has way more restaurants and gyms than it needs so I thought using some of my resources to grow microgreens could be fun and profitable. Our farmers market season is about to start and I wanted another outlet besides that.\n\nIf he washes his produce, nobody gets sick 🙄\n\nThough they might be using it as an excuse not to do business with a friend. Friendships have been destroyed that way.\n\nSome things like listeria don't care if you wash your produce, unfortunately\n\nI don’t think that’s it. I run a graphic design business that also does decals and shirt printing and I’ve done a bunch of work for his place. It’s basically a bar-cade with a restaurant and I just think he’s a bit naive when it comes to stuff like that.\n\nMy dad got his garden certified so he could donate to the food bank. I guess that’s different than restaurants though.\n\nI think you just need a food safe property. My aunt sells fruit into groceries store and there’s a lot of rules around it. I’m not sure what it is actually called but it’s to do with food safe measures I think.\n\nGrocery sales are VERY different from selling to restaurants. It becomes even more complicated if the grocery store operates in multiple states. Produce grading alone is a fucking monster in complexity.\n\nI don’t think it would really matter unless the health inspector was at the restaurant when you showed up. Different areas have different food codes.\n\nI forage for mushrooms throughout the year, and during peak seasons I’ll bring my surplus to restaurants to buy. Typically Chanterelles, oysters, and the occasional chicken of the woods. I even talked a chef into buying 20lbs of wood ear mushrooms one year. He wasn’t sold at first, but I told him different ways to utilize them and how he would be the only chef in town showcasing them.\n\nLike a high class restaurant or something? I’d imagine I can’t really walk into an outback and ask if they want to buy vegetables?\n\nAnything that's locally owned is a potential sale.\n\nIndian and Bangladeshi restaurants like these.\n\nTo add to flash-tractors comment, 1:30pm-3:30pm ON A WEEKDAY.\n\nNo weekend arrivals. The restaurant(s) will appreciate it.\n\nSome small co-op type grocery stores will do this too.\n\nI love your confused but proud face\n\nEyeliner is top notch too\n\nCome here to say this. Love the bottom lashes🆒🆒🆒\n\n@op, you look to me like a dark haired Daphne from Frasier :) saying with the best intentions as I love that show\n\nMakeup giving me eye of ra vibes.\n\nI was thinking the same thing lol. Grow peppers they said lol\n\nmake a fermented hot sauce!\n\nWell those look like hot peppers. Soooo you can ferment them, directions online, and use it like Tabasco. You can pickle them, also online, to use on sandwiches, salads etc. You can chop and freeze some for cooking this winter. You can stuff them with what you like to eat and freeze them, cooked, and enjoy them as quick meals all winter. There is lots of stuff you can do! Enjoy your lovely harvest!!\n\nI like tabasco sauce. any recipe close to the real tabasco? also sriracha.\n\nSame idea as saurkraut. Every recipe will be some variation of; Salt it to something 3% to limit microorganisms. Innoculate with lactic acid bacteria if preferred. The fermentation bacteria are ubiquitous, so adding in your own is completely optional.  \nAllow to ferment, blend it up or don’t.  \n\nCareful you don’t poison yourself with botulism.\n\nUsually it’s a 2% salt solution :-)\n\nI live in a climate where \"room temperature\" runs a little higher so 5% works better for my fermentation. It works slower, but less mold. r/fermentation gives you some ideas that are helpful.\n\nI love making lacto fermented hot sauce: saltwater, hot peppers, onion, tomato, peaches or mango. Let it ferment until the liquid gets clear and theres no more action. Strain most over the liquid. Blend the ingredients while adding liquid back to desired thickness/heat. Then bottle in swing top bottles.\n\nYum!\n\nFerment all the things!\n\nHot pepper jelly...it's amazing\n\nOhhh.  So good!\n\nYes! Was looking for this comment Pepper jelly is delicious!\n\nOoh, I'd love to try it with these. We do Jalepeno jelly over cream cheese as a spread with crackers and it's so good.\n\nCould dehydrate some and grind them into a spice to put on or in stuff\n\nWear a respirator!\n\nSmoothie time!\n\nforbidden protein shake 😵\n\nYou should pack a peck of pickled peppers!\n\nWhat are these? Scotch bonnets?\n\nthey are reaper crossed with scorpions. niche stuff lol\n\nOh they gonna be some hot bois\n\nIm imagining a scorpion with a grim reaper scythe o.O\n\nWhy on earth would you grow so many?\n\nSome people just want to ~~watch~~ taste the world burn\n\nits only 6 plants tho. is that many!?\n\nI have 20+ habañeros, 12 Jalapeños, 15 Serrano, 8 or 9 cayenne, and 20+ banana peppers, so personally, I think you need more. I need more...\n\nThen the only solution is hot sauce experimentation. Get this on Hot Ones, bet it'd be amazing.\n\none guy suggested you sell them to a restaurant but what restaurant needs peppers this hot? \n\nI'm fermenting my super hot peppers this year to make sauces that will last longer than usual, probably like a year in the fridge. for the rest I would either dehydrate or can them. it's just so many and they're so hot, I would focus on preserving them because like half of one of those peppers would be enough for a whole pot of chili lol. gonna be hard to use them all.\n\nOh, so they're practically inedible.\n\nHot sauce. Hot sauce is the way.\n\nHot sauce making time!\n\nI had a bumper crop of habaneros a couple of years back, so I smoked them and then ground them up into powder. Now we've got a pound or so of smoked habanero powder that we're probably going to have for the rest of our lives, because just a little bit goes a really long way.\n\nStep 2: ?\nStep 3: Profit!\n\nMake a spicy meatball 🤌\n\nr/hotsauce\n\nThese are going to be too hot for most people. I don’t think your average restaurant can use them. \n\nIf you don’t want to use them all yourself, you will want to sell them or give them away. \n\nI could sell them because I go to farmers markets and people know I have hot peppers, so they come looking for me. You just have to figure out where to find your potential customers, trust me, they’re out there.\n\nIf there’s a store that specializes in hot sauces, check with them. Poke around on social media to find where the real pepper heads are hiding. Check here on Reddit, use all the social media you can think of. You will probably find there is a sort of local network for this stuff, you just have to tap into it. Lots of people make their own hot sauces.\n\nMake sure to save a bunch of seeds, too.\n\nSaw you said they are Reaper x Scorpion .....fuggin spicy stuff eh?\n\nDry some and make homemade pepper flakes and powder!\n\nUse some in a chili crisp recipe as well\n\nFerment a lot, and then use them up in sauces, ingredients in dressings, and such.\n\nI've never eaten a pepper like that fresh, and don't know your tolerance, so I'm not gonna say snack on them all willy nilly but....after a few months of nibbling on my aji charapitas and habaneros I can def say I've developed SOME tolerance.  Not a lot, but some haha\n\nAnyways they are damn beautiful, well done!  Did you grow in containers or in the ground?\n\nForget the peppers show us your shoulder workout routine 🤣🤣🤣\n\n[removed]\n\ni love rhea 🥰\nshes my fitness inspiration\n\nWow, they're so pretty! Wish I could have a couple XD\n\nI suppose dry them and powder them! Or make sauce? But watch the fumes.\n\nwell, get some Tomatoes, Eggplants onions and carrots and make Zacusca. It's a Romanian (i think) vegetable spread and best cooked by the kilo\n\nIdk but you look like a Jojo character, I legit thought this is r/stardustcrusaders\n\nLike how a pet chooses you, you are now a hot sauce artisan if you choose to accept it.\n\nIf you don't, but are willing, I'd scoop / dry the seeds, dehydrate the skin for powder, name the strain something you love, and offer to distribute the seeds with our pepper community. \n\nWe're willing to pay postage I'm sure.\n\nThen crowds cheering, banners going up with your name, you are crowded a Reddit legend! The OG in an online community watching from your throne, new posts of people growing peppers literally croping up from your contribution. Validation that you have payed it forward to other like-minded people. Becoming a pepper producing God of social media!\n\n...or maybe I'd just like some seeds for next year.\n\nBeautiful harvest! You can probably make sauce, jelly, powder, and freeze some. PPE is essential at this scale.\n\nBrad Leone’s fermented hot sauce recipe is a great base for exploring fermented Hot sauces.\n\nThose are so gnarly; my eyes are watering from here! At my restaurant we used to make \"rocket fuel\" by simmering a case of scotch bonnets in white vinegar until they were mushy and then puree the whole thing with a stick blender into a paste. Working it required a mask and goggles and preferably no one else around for a while. We would freeze it in small containers batches and use it sparingly to add heat to whatever - sauces, dressings, even ice cream lol. One batch lasts forever.\n\nYou can safely substitute pepper varieties in any tested canning recipe. So a recipe for Cowboy Candy that usually uses jalapenos will use these. Ditto pickled peppers. Ditto hot pepper jelly. Ditto salsa.\n\nOr, if you just cook with them like I do, freeze them whole. Then chop them frozen and they are less likely to squirt juice at you. Yes, they will be mushy but if you're using them in recipes, who cares?\n\nSmoke them and grind them into chipotle seasoning. Best seasoning I've ever had. I've used it by itself as well with salt pepper garlic mix for dry rubs and every time it was by far my favorite.\nSlide in half, destem/deseed, smoke at whatever temp until they're dry. I would leave them on the top rack when I was smoking something else.\nI do this every season and it makes great gifts. DO. NOT. SMELL THE POWDER. You will sneeze for 20 minutes. Great for clearing sinuses though.\n\nThey look really spicy 🤤 you can make a simple recipe: lime juice, sliced onion, sliced pepper and salt/black pepper to your taste, great with anything.\n\nThis is the same dilemma I just had with the cherry tomato harvest. Seedlings that ended up over 5” and so heavy with tomatoes they dragged the wire cages to the ground. I have canned, dehydrated, blanched and frozen, learned to make paste and now looking into tomato powder. If you have a vacuum sealer maybe set up bags with the peppers, fresh herbs and whatever else is needed all together and ready to cook for a low prep meal?\n\nThat's too spicy for me to make something out of other than pepper spray.\n\nThey look like reapers but a diff color. How spicy are they\n\nWhat a fun harvest!\n\nAlso, I love your aesthetic! You're so gorgeous and I wish I looked like you!\n\nFermented hot sauce is a great way to use lots of super-hot peppers.\n\ncompletely unrelated, but your arms look ripped!\n\nA pepper jam would be lovely on my Bake-Off winning light rye bread, with a baby Swiss.  Mmm.  :)\n\nCream cheese and jelly.. mmmm\nNow I know what’s for dinner\n\nHighly recommend pickling after my first experience with it recently, can be very simple and versatile or more specialized if you want.\n\nALSO makeup and especially eyeliner is fire you have that shit ON!\n\nI would pickle that peck of peppers you picked, personally.\n\nWhat you gotta do is take 3 whole bigass white onions, 4 whole peeled bulbs of garlic, and one head of celery and a large carrot. You get that all prepped and chopped then combine it with about a pound of those spicy devils and a cup or two of water in a giant food processor with some salt and blend till it looks like chunky salsa.\n\nSit that shit in a bigass jar on the counter to ferment for a day or so, dump in some vinegar and let it sit for a couple more days and then puree smooth and you’ll have some bitchin hot sauce on your hands\n\nOkay the peppers are cool, but your shoulders! 👍🏼🔥👍🏼🔥\n\nYou make da sauce\n\nLove the little black ones in your hair 😍\n\nFermented hot sauce. Throw some peaches in there with them.\n\neat them\n\nEat one and become a redhead.\n\nMaybe too late, but wear gloves !!\n\nCan you purée it and freeze it? Is that a thing?\n\nHot sauce\n\nYou make hot sauce duh\n\nWhen life gives you peppers make hot sauce\n\nYou should pack a peck of pickled peppers!\n\nSpectacular harvest. Well done!\n\nr/actualmightyharvest\n\ndry them in the oven ,make sambal (hot sauce), make sriracha (ferment for 7 days minimum). Just af few ideas.\n\nI'm interested in seed exchange. Dm?\n\nMake Aji sauce.\n\nIt's a South American pepper sauce similar to salsa.\n\nVery good.\n\nMake salsa as well. \n\nCould also pickle.\n\nHoly crap. Are those Hungarian peppers??? With the thinner skins? How the heck did you get them to grow so well? I usually get one of two (in zone 10b). \n\nMake stuffed Hungarian style peppers! You can use ground beef/pork (or both!)... if veg, the ground soy-like pellets work wonders too. \n\nI'd be stuffing those and storing in the freezer for latch-key dinners. :)\n\nhot pepper jelly!!!!! 🌶️🌶️🌶️\n\nYou look disgruntled as hell!\n\nOooo lovely! I got 1 entire super hot pepper this year despite starting like 30 plants. Bad, wet year here. So very jealous. Make fermented pepper mash, dehydrate for powder, experiment with hot sauce?\n\nWhat kind of peppers are these? I don’t think I’ve seen them before! Be very cool looking. Congrats on the harvest!\n\nWhat kind of peppers are these?\n\nIt looks like you have All the peppers.\n\nWe make a salsa / sandwich spread with our Habaneros.  Mixed with some sweet peppers it turns out great!  Online recipe is a play on the Huy fong (spel?) chili-garlic sauce.  We give jars of them to our spicy friends for holiday presents.  Good luck and enjoy!\n\nI didn't know Rhea Ripley had a sister who was into farming. Nice.\n\nShe’s hot and grows hot stuff.. dam\n\nSend it to the supermarket. I wish I found peppers this fresh in the supermarket\n\nSmoke them, then dehydrate them\n\nFind someone that owns a parrot and give them some. Parrots can’t detect heat and typically love peppers!\n\nYou look like we could be besties.\n\noh hi bestie ☺️\n\n\nwhat should we do on our hangout \n\nMan, and here I am with full grown ass plants and just one pepper! Come on peppers! You can do it!\n\nEat one ☝🏽\n\nMf goals\n\nYour lemons deflated, OP.\n\nCandy them, use em to make hot sauce, dry them for later use, can them, give them away, sell them...there are so many options. \n\nBtw I love the photo of you with them! 🤣\n\nThis always happens to me. The crazy hot pepper that I only want a small amount outperforms everything else in the garden\n\nMake homemade hot sauce idk how but something about a big glass jar and salt and letting it ferment I'll try it one day but you have to have a bunch of peppers and it looks like that's covered\n\nYou can make pepper jelly.\n\nI’ve got you big time. Assuming those are reapers? If they are:\n5 reapers deseeded, 12 scotch bonnets or habanero (for flavor), also deseeded. Cut the tops off throw them into a pot with a whole bag of the long carrots shaved and diced down, put them into the pot with the peppers and fill the pot up with white vinegar. (You can torch the peppers first before boiling if you want a more Smokey flavor.) You want to cover them up a few inches over with the vinegar as it will evaporate some during the cooking process. Boil for 45mins and open all your windows and evacuate your house. No joke the fumes will scorch your lungs. After 45mins add 1 whole onion diced, a whole clove of garlic, one red and one orange bell pepper (or cubanelles if you’re going the Smokey route). Add those to the pot and boil them for another 5-10mins till you smell the fragrance of the added items, after that dump the whole pot into a blender with a generous amount of cilantro and about 8 oz of pineapple juice to balance out the spice. Blend it up to your desired texture and you will have the best hot sauce you’ll ever have. This recipe will make a hot sauce about an 8 out of 10 on the spice level. If you want less spice use 3 reapers as they are only good for their spice, they don’t taste good to me imo.\n\nWhat pepper is this?\n\nMake hot sauce! Or try infusing some in honey!\n\nHOT SAUCE. Fermented. Not fermented. Hot pepper jelly. Go crazy.\n\nMake hot sauce. When you are growing super hots, that's about all you can do, they aren't good for much else. Good news is, they are really good for hot sauce.\n\nYour pretty!\n\nYou could dehydrate some and make a hot-ass spice blend 🥰🔥\n\nI don't have advice that hasn't been mentioned (I vote jelly) but as a pepper lover this is my favorite post\n\nSend some over, I'll send some potatoes back and you can make hot potatoes stuffed with cheese and peppers!\n\nFirst , I’d pickle a peck.\n\nHot sauce\nDried pepper\nPepper chutney\n\nThose look ridiculously hot\n\nTrick or treat!  Peppers instead of candy 😛\n\nTo not show us the garden is cruel\n\nGarage sale?\n\nWOW, how many plants was this??\n\nCrush them and defeat your enemies with them!\n\nIdk what those are but they look like they're really hot. \n\nFermented hot sauce 100%\n\nPickled eggs! Cut up 20 of these peppers and pickle them with four dozen eggs for one month."

    "all_comment_text": "They are beautiful plants! Unfortunately they can be invasive in many places, so please be sure to collect seeds before the wildlife can spread them around.\n\nI appreciate that, was unaware they could be invasive. Wasn’t sure as I live in zone 6, but I will make sure I clean up the seeds and remove any I don’t want in the yard.\n\nThey’ve taken over the hillsides in SoCal (9a) it’s really depressing bc they grow so fast and spread by bird droppings, they’re almost impossible to eradicate. \n\nI’ve grown a hatred for them, and have considered keeping a machete in the trunk to chop them down.\n\nI hate them, too! One of my favorite little hillsides that was once full of native wildflowers as of last spring, is covered in these leggy things. OP’s looks much better than the street urchin ones in my area, though. I’m glad they bring joy to others!\n\nI feel this.  When I was younger I just loved lily of the valley, the look of it, the smell of it, I thought it was great. \n\nNow that I am older, and have gone to college in environmental field.. I cant stand them. A local park that was once full of native flowers, is now a field of lily of the valley that escaped from the nearby neighborhoods. \n\nEverywhere in town you'll spot goutweed running wild, along with perriwinkle, and english ivy. All of which are still available to buy in our garden shops.\n\nThere is no shortage of purely monophagous pests of the Castor plant within their native range. So I kind of assume that inertia, over-caution, and its (mostly historical at this point) status as a crop, is what keeps us from using biological controls against it.\n\nThey’re horrible.\n\nThe grounds crews of Griffith Park in L.A. are fighting a never-ending war against castor plants. They’re so poisonous that it’s a public danger. \n\nYeah, I saw them everywhere this year. Some even growing at the end of my driveway\n\nChopping invasive plants, one more reason to always carry a knife.\n\nHarbor freight has very cheap machetes\n\nI really hate to gatekeep, but like the anvil shaped objects they used to and still sell (though by popular demand they finally started carrying a decent one in the last couple years), those are machete shaped objects.   \n\nFor example, the only stainless steels that could arguably be suitable for a machete won't be found at anywhere near that price point.   And the ones with a sawback are even more likely to break because they are stainless.\n\nI just hacked one to death with a shovel, grows all over the place and I get in trouble for not clearing.\n\nAny time I see them I snap the stem and stomp all over the trunk.\n\nDon't let the seeds near any animals, very toxic.\n\nhttps://www.poison.org/articles/what-happens-if-i-eat-castor-beans-222#:\\~:text=a%20castor%20bean%3F-,The%20castor%20bean%20is%20the%20seed%20of%20the%20castor%20oil,sometimes%20used%20to%20make%20jewelry.\n\nThe risk is highest in zones 8-11, but still better to be safe and remove. Thanks for taking precautions! And good luck on your gardening!\n\nIn Zone 6 you don't need to worry about the plant becoming invasive. Zone 6 is quite a few zones away from being a concern.  (Pearl-clutching netizens do love to run around with their hair on fire.)   \n  \nCongrats on the plant!  Beautiful!\n\nThey are terrible and everywhere in Mexico. Please keep its seeds off water streams, birds or other vectors, because it's THAT kind of invasive in temperate and warm zones.\n\nWow thanks for sharing, if you hadnt told me this is a castor plant id go another 20 some years without a clue what those purple plants are along the freeway.\n\nHere in Cape Town, South Africa they are very invasive and spread like wild fire and like morning glory is very difficult to control\n\nYes, invasive here in Southern California as well. Supposedly they were introduced and grown here for castor oil?\n\nLol I gotta ask, with the incredible toxicity of the castor beans, what do you plan to do with them?\n\nI got these seeds from a garden show, I grow it ornamentally in my greenhouse garden. I just really like the color and the balance and uniqueness it brought to my garden. Also just thought it was really cool to grow haha.\n\nDont listen to him. Behind that castor plant is a poppy seed farm.\n\nHe’s growing happy drugs and sad drugs\n\n\"Happy Drugs and Sad Drugs\" 🤣\n\nNew webshow: Ricin and Happiness\n\nYou weren’t supposed to say anything about that, who’s paying you ?\n\nW.W.\n\nThat is super cool!\n\nI grow datura in my garden as I love the flowers. And yes it’s deliriously poisonous ☠️\n\nI do also have an angel trumpet tree as well which I love, but I take precautions when trimming and cutting. The flowers just smell amazing on them.\n\nThere was another post about these and how beneficial they are for bats and bees.\n\nMy front yard has datura and castor bean lol. I like to live dangerously\n\nr/Datura\n\nOnly extremely hallucinogenic in small doses\n\ni grow these plants in my garden because the moles keep a wide berth\n\nI read in a oriental medicine book that some part of this plant is good for (and I quote) \"Painful scrotum\"\n\nYeah, if you eat some of the beans, you'll be pain free , eternally.     Jk, don't ever eat them they're toxic\n\nLol I just had to look it up again and it says the leaf, but no one should take advice from a random dude on Reddit.. and if you got a painful scrotum should probably just head to the doctor\n\nOP recently watched breaking bad\n\nWow it's huge and all from a tiny seed. Great looking plant!\n\nThank you ! One of my favorites this year, I started 3 and this was the only one that came to fruition. I love the color and I’ll be adding more next year.\n\nNow you need to learn how to make cold process soap with castor oil from your beans.\n\n[removed]\n\n1 bean is enough to kill an adult.  Kids can die just from putting it in their mouths.\n\nThat is not true.   These seeds have a tough coating and genreally pass through the system without being digested.\n\nThe castor oil contains little if any of the infamous ricin.   You should look at the stats before making such silly statements.\n\n[removed]\n\nNope.  Insanely lethal.\n\nIt's the best for softening and sudsing. I add it to my deer tallow soap.\n\nThis is a favorite of mine - I grow them every year. Congrats on your first Castor bean!\n\nGreat looking guy too.\n\nAre you an under watered plant? Because you’re looking a bit thirsty! 😜\n\nI must be an over watered cactus, cause I'm dead 💀 🤣\n\nBONK\n\n[removed]\n\nthese are weeds in socal. They are pretty i suppose , just growing up with them literally everywhere its hard to see them that way. How was you experience growing it on purpose?\n\nIn my growing zone 13, it’s an invasive weed.\n\nMy favourite plant!! I spent my PhD studying castor bean proteins and I always snap a photo whenever I see one. Yours looks great!! :)\n\nMy parents used to grow lots of castors on their farming land, they sent the beans to small workshop and had the castor oil extracted, they also made ropes from the stems\n\nFinally someone mentioned that castor oil can be made from the Castor Bean plant. The poison part is the Racine that's in the plant. I don't know how either is extracted and made\n\n[removed]\n\n[removed]\n\nYeah, castor plants grow wild all around my area, (central Florida)I agree they're beautiful. I also have an angel trumpet bush in the back yard, I'm no stranger to the dangerous plants I was just curious, I've never seen anyone who cultivated castor intentionally.\n\nIn my zone 6 this was the first I’ve ever seen of them. People are mystified by it, I wasn’t aware of how widespread and invasive they can become. Will do my best to ensure they don’t spread although I’m dubious they would with the cold winters up here. \n\nMy angel trumpet is potted and just went into bloom this summer, but I do have to bring it in at the end of each season which it’s getting very close to now.\n\nYou should be good in zone 6, I'm in zone 6 and grow them as annuals. They definitely let you know when the first frost hits! I try and harvest my seeds shortly before then. I have about 30 in my backyard! I think the tallest is around 12 ft tall. Right now my castors, elephant ears and datura are the show stoppers while everything else is beginning to crap out.\n\n[removed]\n\nWow those purplish green leaves are so cool! What a beauty!\n\nI love it, the newer leaves almost seem to change hues when you look at them from different angles. My favorite plant this year, excited to do more next year.\n\nAwesome! So glad your first go-round went so well!\n\nThank ya ! Cultivating seeds from it now and hopefully more will take in the spring !\n\nDang so pretty. I might try to grow some next year after seeing this\n\nVery toxic plant, be careful if you do.\n\nMy dad used to grow them (until little kids started visiting.) They would be absolutely massive!\n\nIt was funny watching the cops flying their little helicopter around looking for weed and then taking a bit longer when they went by our house. My dad always got a chuckle and would make fun of them. I swear that was why he planted them.\n\nLolol I can definitely relate , I’ve been asked by numerous people if I’m growing some new purple weed in my yard. \n\nIt’s a beautiful plant, and is just something that doesn’t occur in my zone naturally and I like to try growing unique and new plants I’ve never seen before.\n\nPeople have died from smoking castor leaves they mistook for wild marijuana. \n\nIt's kind of funny that the legal plant is pretty deadly while weed makes you giggle a lot.\n\nWell, I don’t think you can consider smoking castor is a gateway drug like weed supposedly is lol\n\nFek yeah brother, those can get even bigger. If you can get some real manure, they get huge.\n\nAn interesting plant that loves sun. Seeds look like ticks, and don’t let any kids eat them.\n\nWhoa! Dangerous but beautiful.\n\nSuch a cool looking plant! Love the vivid colors.\n\nWho makes your overalls. Those look nice and soft compared to the normal nearly crunchy denim or duck from carheart or whatever.\n\nI found this pair thrifting some generic brand but all cotton, and I dyed them purple myself just because lol.\n\nNo brand???\n\nNice!!!\n\nLove it!\n\nWow now op can produce Castor oil of his own *searching for diarrhoea emoji *\n\nMan those are all over the place where I live haha\n\nHaha this is really cool! I’m used to seeing these growing as weeds where I’m from but one person’s trash is another person’s treasure right? Love the multicolored leaves. Both of you are looking good :)\n\nIn my zone these are an invasive weed. When the pods get dry they snap open and fire seeds a loooong way. I must agree they are cute tho.\n\nlooks cool but would encourage you to not continue to cultivate - they are invasive trash plants where i'm from. Try a native!\n\nA noxious weed in Australia\n\nThe foliage is beautiful.\n\nThe foliage don't enter into it! It's stone dead!\n\nsuch a beautiful plant\n\nTIL castor plants are toxic and beautiful. Thanks!\n\nIt really is a beautiful plant, but in my neck of the woods, they grow like weeds. The stalks get so thick and they will grow up to 12 feet if you let them. Since i have dogs they are a real menace😢. They make a nice ornamental all the same.\n\nI grow these too! My old neighbour gave me seeds haha his are like yours and mine are about up to my chest they’re small compared to this. How’d you grow it so big?\n\nThat’s beautiful. I didn’t even know this was a thing. Wow!\n\nIt’s lovely to see your love for gardening at such a young age.  Look at the beauty that you helped bring about,\n\nCome on, Harvest Moon!\n\nNice love castor !\n\nWith my love for gardening, I'm very fortunate to live where I do, geographically. . . We only freeze maybe a half dozen times in the winter and never see snow. . . I can grow plants 9 or 10 months a year . . . Thank you for sharing your beautiful plants with us !\n\nWe are in the same garden zone but mine are still a little smaller than yours.. maybe 4.5ft?? My goal is to grow them as tall as yours. I just love castor beans. They’re my favorite ornamental hands down.\n\nnice broad leaves 🔥\n\nCastor plants are just gorgeous!\n\nLooks deadly! 🤙\n\nis that where the infamous castor oil comes from?\n\nAmazing! looks very happy and healthy\n\nNice! Poison king 🫡\n\nJust, beautiful .\n\nLove this! I've been looking for seeds locally, no dice yet!\n\nWhy? They grow wild all over FL. What can they be used for?\n\nI just liked it as an ornamental plant in my garden, I live up in New England and this is the first I’ve ever seen around here.\n\nNice very cool 😎\n\nNice Dahlias!\n\nLooks great! I Iove the color. Great job!!\n\nThose are cool looking plants.\n\nAbsolutely gorgeous. Is this only toxic to humans, or is it toxic to other animals as well? It’s so beautiful! And I love tall plants! 😍\n\nBeautiful!\n\nCan the branches of seed pods be used in bouquets? How long do they last? Do they make the other flowers wilt earlier than normal?\n\nThey can get MUCH bigger.  I grew some that hit 8-9' easily.\n\nWow! It’s beautiful! Congratulations!\n\nAwesome, mines still pretty small which worries me as we are approaching the fall months lol hopefully my season extension tent works for a while\n\nThat thing is just getting started. I had one that was 15' in a couple years. They are beautiful trees. They shoot their seeds pretty far and will start popping up all over the place.\n\nOmg it's beautiful 😍\n\nVery cool plant. Are you growing it for medicinal or mainly ornamental use?\n\nWow! \nThat's awesome\n\nOmg, what a gorgeous castor plant! Love how some of the leaves match your fit! (intentional or not? 👀)\n\nVery allergenic to my family at least. Didnt know until we had two big ass examples to breathe in every time we came home. Lol\n\nThis is awesome. I love these massive garden treasures. I have a 6ft tall love lies bleeding amaranth plant from seed, zone 5a makes no sense at all, but its the most beautiful thing I’ve grown!\n\nNow you will have plenty of seeds for next year.   let the pods turn brown and begin to crack open.   Those things are really spiny and if you wear work gloves, will tear them up if you're not careful.  I let start to crack open, save them, let them dry and use a pair of pliers to help crack the pod open.  You then get the seeds and the chaff which can be blown off.\n\nYou can overwinter these as a house plant but not sure one that big will do well in limited sun.\n\nWhen starting them, put your seeds in a folded paper towel that's damp.  keep a watch over it for them to sprout.  Once they start to sprout, you can put them in dirt either in pots or close together.  As long as they don't get too big, you can separate them if they're too close together.\n\nI usually have to put stakes near the stock to keep them from tipping over.   You can use the bamboo or simple metal stakes.  I find that deer don't really bother these.\n\nThat plant will keep hanging on until frost.\n\nSo cool!!!!\n\nIt's a beautiful beast\n\nOh they can get so much bigger than that if you’re in the right climate, I’m in as and have one that’s 3ish years old and like 10 ft tall. Those these guys, the red is such a pretty colour.\n\nYassssss! Anytime I'm able to grow anything that has leaves bigger than my face, I've very pleased, haha. Well done, buddy!\n\nNever seen one before, gorgeous!\n\nIt's almost everywhere in India , like weed.\n\nNot sure what I like best, your successful story or your proud face, congrats!!! 🥰\n\nIm currently in Maharashtra india, and castor grows like weed here. Its super invasive\n\n[deleted]\n\nI don’t think it will thrive as well or spread well in New England, I plan to ensure the seeds are picked up after it dies back. However I haven’t noticed any animals or birds attempting to eat the seed pods either.\n\nThey can get like 10 times this size like a small tree\n\nIt’s quite a feeling to see the process from seed to monster garden plants.  Well done.\n\nYou look so proud and adorable! That’s a really cool plant, I love its color and leaves.\n\nLovely and one of the top 10 most deadly plants in the world.  Do share why you grew this instead of say a Kiwi vine.?  Take care around it and keep your animals away.z\n\nTime for a full blown poison garden.. datura, henbane, belladonna, foxglove…\n\nI do have an angel trumpet tree growing elsewhere and foxglove in another garden, just need to combine them!\n\n2nd most toxic plant on earth!\n\nI've heard of these being called mole bean plants and was told to keep the seeds and put them where moles have been and they eat them and die...\n\nNice smile. You did well.\n\nI hope that fixes your husband problem\n\nBeautiful\n\nLove it\n\nThey will regrow from dropped seeds\n\nPositive thing: Your garden looks lovely 😍 \nNegative thing: Eff that mother effing c*** of an effing plant. Took me a year to get rid of the mf. It grows so fast and once the beans pop they go everywhere. Never seen anything grow so fast in my life. If it starts giving you grief just rip it out.\n\nI went down a Wikipedia rabbit hole on plants, landed on trap crops, started researching castor plant facts, and ran across your Reddit as a result.  All I can say is… YOU’RE the trap crop! 😂\n\nSuper invasive in my area, but my son and I enjoy throwing the seed balls at each other when we walk to school. I machete the ones on my property… super annoying. I suppose throwing seeds around doesn’t help curb their spread 🤣\n\nOne of my teachers in high school gave me seeds from one of these plants after she found out I liked growing things. It grew massive so quickly. I'll have to track down some seeds to grow another one this spring.\n\nThat plant grows wildly in Mexico and it is use by witch doctors to inpoisen men in a toxic relationships.\n\n[removed]\n\nCan you smoke it????\n\nDefinitely don’t wanna do that lol, castor plants are incredibly toxic and the beans produce ricin. Any time I prune or cut it I have gloves on and wash my hands thoroughly. Maybe that’s just paranoia idk haha.\n\nI would be just as paranoid.  There is no antidote.\n\nNot that toxic, kids in Brazil will harvest the beans and use them to throw at each other on their way from school.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/WwVza9B0WII?si=2bB5U3SzHH13LjxG\n\n(Guerra means war, and mamoma is how they call the plant in Portuguese)"

PLEASE LET US KNOW IF IT ROOTS!\n\nAND GIVE ME ONE\n\nMe, too! I LOVE the mutation! It's like my grandmother's violets in hydrangea form!\n\nYeah give this guy one! ^\n\nI’m calling dibs too on one of they make it 😭 s\n\nThe enthusiasm in this thread makes me ridiculously happy.\n\nI know right 😂\n\nYes, it's so beautiful!\n\nLol TIL that there is a hobby on earth that craves and gets excited about mutating species #gardeners #doit\n\nThere’s a plant on my street that is entirely like this. I assumed it was a variety so I took a picture to try to find it.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fi274l62p3hd1.jpeg?width=4284&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ee4e3b2ce472dc6659a627e69da5e77ac41492d3\n\nWow that’s quite the specimen! There’s so many h. macrophylla cultivars that it’s unlikely OP has anything unique. But still cool to see all these examples.\n\nAnd now that you brought up varieties, I’m not even sure if there are any varieties of macrophylla. I’m probably wrong though!\n\nEdit: two varieties I can think of are mopheads and lace cap. Forgot about the latter in this species.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/frx2fxxq85hd1.jpeg?width=800&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e255c643f1598c168bb2d43cf044e39366b7f8b1\n\nWow omg\n\nI have hydrangea envy\n\nGod really does have favorites 😭\n\nHydrangea macrophylla Mariko possibly.  It looks very much like this.\n\nI found a variety called ‘Bavaria Blue’. I think that might be it!\n\nI think you’re right! https://www.garden-select.com/en/hydrangea-bicolor-bavaria-3-plants.html\n\nWhere are you located.  I need this in my yard!!\n\nWoah that’s gorgeous\n\nThere were some like this in my neighborhood and I tried to prop them and failed 😞\n\nFailed to root? Or failed to recreate the mutation the following summer?\n\nTechnically both Can be true.\n\nTrue. But it’s a lot more common to have an unstable mutation. Thankfully macrophylla is easy to root.\n\nBut if it only failed to root then there's still hope that it's a stable mutation.\n\nFailed to root\n\nThat’s too bad. Try layering next time! Real simple process! All you need is a rock to keep the branch down and in place.\n\nI just plant leaves half way in the soil. I've grown quite a few that way\n\nI rooted mine in water\n\nThat’s what I tried as well.\n\nIf you know the neighbor, and the plant is big, you could ask for some roots in the fall. I dug out a hydrangea that was being crowded out by an oak and getting peed on by the dog next door (he the best, I’m not even mad). I spit the roots up and planted them around my fence line because waste not want not, right? I’m either burying garbage or planting a bush.  All 5 sections took. They’re much easier to propagate with section of roots than with wood.\n\nThis is a fantastic idea!!! The fall you say? Wonderful!\n\nYou should try to do planting or trimming no later than end of August or beginning of September depending on where you live. At the end of summer the plant is putting all its energy into preparing for winter, so any cuts that need to be healed take away from its reserves. Also, the roots need a little time to take so it's better at the beginning of summer so ideally they're established and below the frost line before the first frost\n\nSounds like u/yeh_mama_a_them knows their stuff. Go with summer.\n\nCut at a join, remove the leaves and put in water in a dark cool place. If you have rooting medium you can coat the cut with it.  The cutting should grow roots.  Once you have a good root ball pot up with half potting soil and half sand. Keep it moist and put outside in a protected area.  Be sure it gets adequate water during dry spells over winter.\n\nOr, do what I do: cut a bunch of lengths off, shove them in the ground, add water and hope. Some will grow, some won’t lol\n\nI'm even lazier. \n\nNeglect the bush, let the canes droop down to the ground, and watch them root themselves. Clip off the mother and dig em up!\n\nDo it with the new green shoots in the spring before they get woody. You'll have no problem!\n\nI suggest doing the same thing but instead of coating the stem in Tar, coat it with “rooting hormone” which you can buy in plant stores or online.\n\nAnd send me a cutting! That is gorgeous  and my wife would love it\n\nYeah but do a wrap propagation to give yourself a higher chance of it succeeding. It’s super easy, just peel back the top layer of bark, pack soil around it with black plastic (if you use a piece of garbage back use it outside of it as the inside has a chemical to help degrade material and it will kill the plant), and then wrap it in clear plastic. It will take a little bit but you’ll have roots and it’s so much easier to cut and propagate the plant.\n\nYou mean [air layering](https://www.rhs.org.uk/propagation/air-layering-plants)\n\nYeah I’ve seen that done on fruiting trees. For a flexible woody plant, layering is the easiest in my humble opinion. The canes on h. Macrophylla go right to the ground with no issue.\n\nFor layering these guys just pull a stem down until it touches the ground, pin it down with a landscaping staple, and cover with some dirt. It will root in about a month and you can just cut off from the main plant and dig the root ball up.\n\nThis is the only correct awnser\n\nYes!!! You can use a U pin to tack the base of the branch on the ground so that it will be easier for it to root and it will still have the support of the parent plant :)\n\nThis is how new cultivars are introduced to the market - either by intensive cross breeding or happy accident like this.\n\nhttps://www.realsimple.com/how-to-propagate-hydrangea-7505210\n\nPlease try to propagate that lovely branch! It will look so cool and unique. Definitely will be a jewel of your garden\n\nThis article confirms that you should attempt to propagate a stem without a bloom. Wonder how that would work in this case?\n\nLater in the season harvest when the flowers go. Or mark the branch and wait until the next season\n\nthis is information I should not have been given 😈\n\nPropagate the branches of chaos and sew new grass\n\nMy apartment building has a bunch of white hydrangeas around the building, but I think they're going to renovate in the next couple years so they might pull them out. The building is 100 years old so who knows how old the hydrangeas are 🥲\n\nIts runing out of toner\n\nThey applied the gradient filter!\n\nCame here to say this. Please refill ink asap\n\nOnce you figure it out please let us know so we can do it to OUR hydrangeas! Beautiful\n\nI dont know but it's stunning\n\nMy first thought was just \"sorry, you're the Chosen One\"\n\nHydrangea mutate often. Done mutations are stable, some are not. How long do you have that plant? As you can never be sure, that they stay in their colour (you could buy a blue one and it might turn white the year after).\n\nI thought that hydrangea color is determined by pH? So the reversion to white is due to the soil not being retreated each year? I don’t know a whole lot about hydrangeas, so I’d love to know how it works!\n\nThe pH level usually affects the color on a blue to pink scale. I say usually because there are varietals that are a bit less responsive to that variation in the soil pH. \n\nWhat you see here is a variegation: the plant changing its color probably due to a mutation. This doesn’t have anything to do with soil amendments.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2f6sfmtww2hd1.png?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=164b59f238bde1c2f1b1c09f04c545ff60614c61\n\nLooks similar like my hydrangea flowers. Never knew it was a mutation and thought it was supposed to be like that (it came with the house). The colors range from pink and white, purple and white, blue and white, and green and white. Yours look beautiful!\n\nSimply gorgeous! I’d show you mine but the lawn guy chopped it up with his weed wacker! 😢🤬\n\nOh no! Was it his first day on the job or something?!\n\nHydrangeas are the mood ring of the plant world. I’ve seen green go white and colour shifting blue to pink ones (depending on soil ph, neutral soil gives a nice purple-blue). I’ve never seen a white and blue combination before.\n\nAs the other person said, it could also be a mutation.\n\nMood ring is the best description I’ve heard for them.\n\nWhat's up is that it's absolutely beautiful!!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u00lhgwd14hd1.jpeg?width=4000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7cc7d6e0aee7e59c95c197e7a716c3ddd80073b1\n\nForgot the name, but I've purchased them cut before.\n\nIt's very pretty\n\nIt's a sport \" genetic mutation\".  Try to root it.  Could be worthwhile.\n\nDo you know if it’s better to try to root it after it’s done flowering, or any time?\n\nNOW!       Look up Air Layering, a way to propagate a plant.\nIt's not hard.  Moss, saran wrap, tape, root hormone, water,\n\nWhatever it is I love it\n\nWow look at her showing off\n\nIt's beautiful 😍\n\nBush wanted to change things up this time\n\nPropagate!! Gorgeous\n\nWhat’s up with your hydrangeas is they’re thriving!\n\nA beautiful mutation?? Pls try to propogate\n\nGive it a name and get it registered? 😁\n\nHoly shit op, that looks fantastic! \n\nIf that’s a stable mutation and you propagate it I’m gonna be really jealous\n\nI dunno man but mine was blue last year and now its pink 😅\n\nIncreasing soil acidity will bring it back to blue.\n\nIt took some magic mushrooms\n\nIdk but that sure is gorgeous\n\nOooooo variegation, if you do propagate make sure you use some rooting hormone and MAKE MULTIPLE CUTTINGS FROM SAME STEM. I work at a plant nursery and we run through hydrangeas like it’s nothing \n\nAlso once rooted, maybe pot them into a 8-12in pot for a season before throwing them in the ground. More roots more chance of survival\n\nSo pretty I took a screen shot and now have a new wallpaper on my phone🤩\n\nIt is something in the soil. My dad had a row of Hydrangeas he would put things in the soil under the plants rusty nails, copper pennies and other things his flowers would be different colours\n\nYou're running out of ink\n\nDude. It's beautiful\n\nSave the seeds!\n\nIt’s really cool.\n\nIt’s so beautiful oh my gosh!\n\nIdk, but it’s gorgeous!\n\nIt's not a phase mom!\n\nI thought the color was based on the acidity of the soil?\n\nI've never been a fan of hydrangeas, but yours are so beautiful!\n\nUm, clearly there’s something “wrong” with it and you should give it to me… for safety\n\nGorgeous ness is up\n\nLooks like you have a few other branches that are the opposite, light in the middle with blue edges. If you are looking at the super pretty mutation look to the lower left and upper left. Would that be considered a mutation as well?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pjklzx4v27hd1.jpeg?width=1242&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1a15a4669f2359cf5eb59278209313243243eb12\n\nHydrangeas aren’t really my forte, but I love plants and flowers so I thought I would ask!\n\nI love my hydrangeas but the pictures here are giving me flower envy\n\nThat's so neat!!   Are you going to try and press or dry some? I agree with the idea to try propping them. I'd buy a hydrangea like this in a heartbeat.\n\nSeriously lovely.\n\nI have no idea, but that is beautiful!!!!\n\nbobross happy accident /bobross\n\nBeautiful!!\n\nYou got lucky that's what happened\n\n😻\n\nIt's doing its best.\n\nCityline Mars?\n\nMutated? I love it .The ninja turtles could never\n\n“Hi Drangea, my names Waylon”\n\nThose are stunning.\n\nthis is so beautiful I audibly gasped omg\n\nA beautifull mutation ❤️\n\nWow that is an awesome mutation. Got to love nature!\n\nIT'S SO PRETTY AND MAGICAL!! Please propagate and make this a thing :)\n\nWow it’s freaking gorgeous! Please try to propagate and then update us! Lol 🤩\n\nIts amazing !\n\nSoo pretty!\n\nIf you’ve ever taken a cutting, do so now and try to propagate this.\n\nI’ve worked with hydrangeas for *years* and haven’t seen something like this.\n\nMy neighbour said she added rusty nails in an hydrangea pot so the pink flowers turn blue, could it be something like that happening ?\n\nWOWIE ITS LIKE FROSTY ON THE EDGES SO COOL :D\n\nIf you know the variety, reach out to the breeding company as this can be something they are interested in! Many have breeders/researchers on staff to work with mutations like this to bring us new plants 😍\n\nI don't know l, but it's beautiful!\n\nDon't the city line ones look like this? So pretty!\n\nThe most beautiful hydrangea mutation! Such a lovely, happy plant!\n\nRan out of ink\n\nit looks fucking awesome?\n\nLoving that bloom’s personality!\n\nShe fancy!\n\nSomatic mosaicism due to mutation. This happens in humans too but we don’t get cool patterns, just cancer\n\nSoil pH makes hydrangeas change color so could this be a sign that your soil pH needs to be changed if you want them to stay blue. I think it looks beautiful.\n\nWhat is the name of the original hydrangea that this grew on?\n\nI don't know but it's cool\n\nSome genetic mutation. Looks great 💙\n\nIt’s like a lil birthmark!\n\nAlso, it could need aluminum sulfate since they are hydrangeas. That's what helps turns them blue. Might be a mutation but could also be a nutrient distribution/deficiency that you will see on more blooms\n\nIf it's not broken, don't fix it. It's beautiful let it grow a6see what happens.\n\nIt is a mutation as suggested and I would try propagating it. I would be interested to see what you get out of it.\n\nIts soil ph. The ph of the soil determines the flower color of a hydrangea. I don’t believe it’s a mutation, but that particular flower had a different ph. My hydrangea had multiple colors this year.\n\nThat wouldn’t be the first bloom by chance?  Hydrangeas do tend to bleach out in the sun sometimes.\n\nHi Drangea, my name is Waylon\n\nHydrangeas change color based on soil pH.  You may have an actual mutation or it may just be because the soil near the roots of that branch is different from the soil the rest of the plant is living in.\n\nIt pretty\n\nGorgeous 😍\n\nIt’s beautiful? That’s nothing wrong 🥰\n\nWow! It’s gorgeous. Apparently some of the plant is getting different nutrients affecting the color.\n\nIt’s cute!  Stands out in its own unique glory. It’s like the Ugly Duckling! 🦢 \n\nBut I can’t tell you why it happened, sorry.\n\nI don’t know what’s going on but I’m extreme envious bc it is gorgeous!!!\n\nIt’s very pretty whatever happened\n\nGod wants to bless you with it.\n\nHow incredibly neat! Try to grow it out!\n\nThat's the outgoing one that does show choir in high school.\n\nStunner!!!!\n\nGorgeous!!\n\nPretty!\n\nI’d be happy to take it off your hands for you 😁💜\n\nGorgeous!\n\nSuper pretty\n\nHaving family from the Azores and have seen a more hydrangea than one can imagine. The colors will highly be based on soil ph levels. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bt_Aje23X74\n\nBoof it\n\nThats awesome!\n\nNo idea, but I LOVE it!!!\n\nDaaang! Beautiful\n\nI had some baking soda to like 3 tablespoons and a 3 gallon container then pour it all over them that’ll fix it\n\nDon't know but you might find this interesting\n\nhttps://www.americanscientist.org/article/curious-chemistry-guides-hydrangea-colors\n\nWhat a great article, thanks! \n\nBefore I just knew that the color was tied to soil pH, but this explains in greater detail why.\n\nWhat a lovely mutation!!!\n\nShe's beautiful 🤗❤️\n\nI smell a new cultivar...\n\nJust a 2024 bring 2024 even in the plants\n\nI have no idea, but I love it!\n\nA different mineral in the soil might change the color. Acidic soil with aluminum makes blue, alkaline with iron makes pink.\n\nI have heard that they change colors over the years? Idk where I heard that from but.. ya\n\nThey ran out of blue need to add more\n\nI’m not sure, but I believe it is due to some Ph change of the soil.\n\nSome of the roots may be in differently fertilized soil. My mother has a plant that’s a mix of blue bloom and pink ones. She managed that by using different fertilizers in specific spots of the pot.\n\nThe Ph of the soil can change the color of your hydrangeas. So maybe something dealing with that?\n\nNothing wrong with your hydrangeas. The soil ph changes over time changing your hydrangea colors.\n\nRead description paragraph at this link: https://plants.ces.ncsu.edu/plants/hydrangea/\n\nThey are gorgeous\n\nits prettying\n\nMy wife, who has become obsessed with our hydrangea, read somewhere that the color of the flowers depend on the PH of the soil.  Ours is deep purple, too, but haven’t seen that gorgeous mutation yet.\n\n😯\n\nWhereabouts are you located? Anywhere near DMV? I’d love a cutting!\n\nLooks like the Saori cultivar of hydrangea\n\nI’m so jealous! Ours get eaten but the deer so quickly (pink and white) but these are incredible! Definitely propagate them! … and send to NJ!\n\nMine turned completely white ☹️\n\nIt’s beautiful!\n\nWow\n\nr/reallifeshinies"

    "all_comment_text": "This has strong UK vibes\n\nyes 😅 it is\n\nWhy is this dissimilar to a garden not in the UK? Genuine curiosity.\n\nLong and narrow framed by hedges. Row houses are common in the UK which leads to rectangular backyards the width of the house.\n\nAh, that makes sense, thank you!\n\nI knew it was Ireland or uk as it’s all so green. You need a lot of rain to keep a garden this green.\n\nI thought this instantly. The choice of plants, the paving stones. It gave me a nostalgia hit.\n\nAre you a landscaper or is this your home?\n\nI'm a landscaper 👍\n\nCool! You do a great job I bet the owners are super happy 😊\n\nHow much of your time is dedicated to this beauty?\n\nHow much does it cost to hire you to build something similar for my garden?\n\nNeat garden well set out\n\nIf my garden looked like that I think it would be maintaining my sanity. Beautiful place , OP.\n\nSo this is probably a dumb question, but I've always wondered: \n\nhow do landscapers get the light dark rows of grass? \n\nIt's never looked like that (even wibbly wobbly rows) when I mow.\n\nr/lawncare - that group is a trove of information\n\nJust back and forth with a push mower I have gotten much of the result, but nice thick grass accentuates it.  That grass is probably 4x thicker than my current lawn (you get nothing but turn marks in it).\n\nMy guess this is 90% the grass care, 10% a nice sharp blade on a low cut.\n\nYou can get mowers that have a roller on which rolls over the grass once it’s mowed, and gives nice stripes. Depending on the mower it can happen too without a roller, but with a roller will give best results!\n\nUnfortunately we don't have those in Germany. \nI'd have to agree with you. The stripes really are an added bonus.\n\nUnfortunately we don't have those in Germany. \nI'd have to agree with you. The stripes really are an added bonus.\n\nYou actually do not want to mow in the same direction every time.  You end up with grooves in the lawn, and that becomes a pain.  You should mow north - south one week and east -  west the next.\n\nSo Beautiful!!!\n\nI wish I had the functioning parts of my brain just to have this level of organization, let alone the skill.\n\nThat's beautiful , that's a lot of work\n\nI’m thinking of all the possibilities &amp; alternatives to the lawn.\n\ni would cut your grass for free just to hang out in that garden\n\n10/10 would eat breakfast here\n\nDAMN, that's beautiful! 👀❤️ Where do you garden? I need your help!!!\n\nWhat is that beautiful blue shrub in the front left of number 3?\n\nWow, beautiful.\n\nDouble wow! 🤩\n\nWow\n\nUgh, I can't wait to be a home owner. Love this!\n\nThat’s very beautiful landscaping! You’ve done an excellent job! 👍\n\nLooks nice. Lift the blades a notch and mow the opposite direction as well imo\n\nHow do you keep weeds from growing on top of the mulch???\n\n💚💚💚\n\nAbsolutely beautiful.\n\nBeautiful!  Where is this located?  Gardening zone?\n\nI wish I could get my garden to look halfway as nice as this. You did an amazing job.\n\nLove those edges!\n\nNice work\n\nLovely🥰\n\nGreat job!\n\nOutstanding Beautiful garden! 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩❤️\n\nBeautiful !\n\nAbsolutely stunning!  It looks so peaceful! Great job 👏 Lucky you !\n\nWhat is the red bush towards the way back&gt;?\n\nAcer 👌\n\nEngland? Oh I do want to move there.\n\nOasis\n\nThis is the perfect ratio of lawn to garden. Just gorgeous. The edging work is perfect.\n\nWow! How do you do the moss between the bricks? It’s so green and healthy.\n\nI dream about a garden like this!!\n\nSo you stay in paradise… invite me in your paradise please\n\nWhat’s the best approach/system to water them?\nSo beautiful\n\nShould recommend they get rid of the  stripey grass;  wasted space.  Makes it look synthetic.\n\nGrass is not the devil. This is a perfect example of combining a variety of plants with usable human space.\n\nStripey grass is just a bi-product of efficiently mowing and they don't last long since it's just grass bent in two directions, in OPs picture it's probably already disappeared.\n\nMy little piece of hillside has whatever grass is growing on it, but the parts we're using (the orchard and the area with berries) we keep trimmed for accessibility and to avoid ticks getting on us when we're there, because ticks like tall grass.\n\nWe mow these areas weekly or every two weeks, with a battery-operated lawnmower that does mulching. The grass in these areas looks vibrant green, lush, velvety and manicured and inviting.\n\nWe have never sown grass and we definitely do not water it. It's regular mountain grass, whatever has been growing there for decades, my neighbors let it grow and then bale it and use it as... grass? Hay? For animals. We have very sloped terrain, so most of it we don't even touch. But the mown areas look beautiful.\n\nI want to make something like OP's picture, just so the path to the orchard and to the berry patch looks extra beautiful. A winding path of calm surrounded by shrubs and trees in a thousand different colors.\n\nI understand that monoculture is awful for the environment, but you can have something like OP's picture without it being outright ecocyde.\n\nGorgeous!\n\nSo beautiful!\n\n💘💘💘\n\nI do garden maintenance as well, you are doing an excellent job!\n\nAbsolutely beautiful!  Looks nice for relaxing.\n\nBeautiful\n\nI like arbour.\n\nImagine spending the day here\n\nWonderful!\n\nHow or what tool do you use for that perfect edging.\n\nI just came here to say this is so stunning! Well done 👏\n\nWow love it\n\nThat garden looks awesome, congratulations\n\nUh….mazing!! ♥️❤️☝🏽\n\nOmg this is stunning!\n\nSo nice. Beautiful.\n\nthat’s the way to do it. good stuff bro.\n\nVery cute and quaint\n\nGorgeous!\n\nAwesome!!!\n\nVery nicely done!\n\nLovely 🥰 looks like a great place to get away from all the noise\n\nIt’s gorgeous!\n\nStunning 😍\n\nStunning work\n\ngorgeous\n\nSuch beautiful work!! 😍. What a lovely little retreat\n\nIt’s lovely 😍 I imagine having tea there.\n\nSo beautiful\n\nWow! Beautiful\n\nBeautiful. I love a meandering garden that just draws you in and makes you wanna look to see what’s around the corner.\n\nWow 🌺 gorgeous 🌺 really what do you use to edge 👍\n\nJesus that’s amazing. I wish you could maintain my garden. But I’m in California and it’s currently just a bunch of dead plants.\n\nBeautiful!\n\nGoals!! 🔥\n\n😍😍😍\n\nYou must be retired.\n\nThat is not a garden, that is heaven 🌺\n\nThose grass lines tho ❤️🫡\n\nWhat a piece of paradise! I would love that but wouldn’t have a clue how to start\n\nLovely. Even more impressive that you DIY! Carry on, OP!\n\nLove the first pix! Nice work\n\nSo I am curious, how many times a year do you fertilize that grass?\n\nBeautiful 😍\n\nFantastic work, what a beauty to look at!\n\nWhat’s the process to get edging like that?\n\nBeautiful ❤️\n\nBeautiful work!!\n\nBeautiful 😍\n\nBeautiful work.  Looks like it’s out of a magazine.\n\nIt’s very stunning!!!\n\nGarden lookin an awful lot like a lawn 😂\n\nOmg it's my fantasy garden 😍this is so beautiful thank you so much for sharing"

    "all_comment_text": "You're rich!\n\nIt’s only 4g 😭\n\nThat's about $60 worth of saffron, enjoy the bounty!\n\nI've had like 10 strands over the years so make of that was you will.\n\nYou might need to divide them. Flower production decreases when they’re too crowded.\n\nI'll try in spring but even the first year was particularly great.\n\nPersian Style Grilled Chicken (jujeh kabob). Here is my recipe: Marinade: Greek Yogurt, grated onions (with a cheese grater, get onion juices). Juice of one lemon. crushed garlic. Salt, pepper, olive oil, Bloomed saffron (grind saffron using mortar and pestle, add a few tablspoons on boiling water to saffron, steep 5 minutes to bloom. you only need about a teaspoon of of ground saffron total.). The yogurt marinade with the bloomed saffron should now be VERY yellow. taste it, make sure it is lemony and salty enough (not too much lemon, you dont want to cook the chicken via acid). Add cubed chicken (big cubes, I prefer chicken breast). Marinate overnight. The marinated chicken is best cooked over high heat charcoal on a skewer. When gilling the chicken, I like to baste the chicken with a mixture of more bloomed saffron, lemon juice, butter. Serve with cucumber mint yogurt and saffron rice.\n\nEDIT\nSince there is interest, here is a recipe I found that is similar to mine (I do highly recommend my baste method however):\nhttps://silkroadrecipes.com/joojeh-kabob/\n\nAnd here is another great recipe that you can do without yogurt:\nhttps://persianmama.com/jujeh-kabob-grilled-saffron-chicken/\n\nThis sounds good! I’ll have to try it with tofu or soy curls and non-dairy yogurt. Thanks for the recipe.\n\nThe Iranian vegan on IG has some awesome recipes starring saffron fyi!\n\nThank you!!! This is perfect. I love Iranian food.\n\nThat’ll be one saffron thread, please 😁\n\n&gt; grated onions (with a cheese grater, get onion juices).\n\nJust reading this made my eyes water.\n\nThat recipe sounds great, though.\n\nLmao the second I saw the saffron I KNEW fellow Persians were going to flock en masse to the comments. It's practically embedded in our DNA\n\nThank you so much for this recipe! I’m going to make this for my family on Thanksgiving :) ! I love that I can make this ahead of time. \n\nHow many saffron threads do you typically grind for a tablespoon?\n\nA tablespoon is a lot of saffron. I meant teaspoon. I’m not sure how many threads. I usually just take a small pinch of threads with my finger and grind them up. Maybe like 15 threads is they are long? And this is to make a big batch of marinades chicken that could feed 8 people. \n\nI was reading before that it says approximately six threads per recipe seems to be an average.\n\nI’m still learning.\n\nYou can get away with using only 6 threads but I recommend more. The more the merrier. \n\nI’m trying this it sounds delicious\n\nPaella. \n\nAlso I like the little bee butt in the flower on the last slide. 🐝\n\nThe bees were very happy. It’s one of the few things that was still blooming in my yard.\n\nRisotto a la Milanese.\n\nYum! I love risotto. Thank you.\n\nWhere is this grown. It would make wonderful Xmas gifts for those that appreciate it.\n\nIt will grow all over the US you just need to get the correct bulb. It’s a specific breed of crocus.\n\nWhich?\n\n*Crocus sativus*\n\nDo you mind if I ask where you got them from?\n\nFor free from Craigslist mostly, the rest from a nursery. Many sell them now and tons of online shops sell them.\n\nGrown in my front yard in the Pacific Northwest USA.\n\nDo u mind sharing where you got the bulbs from?\n\nI actually got 90% of them for free from someone who had them in their yard and didn’t want them, but I got the rest from a local nursery.\n\nWhich nursery? I just ordered these bulbs from Target. Also trying to grow in PNW\n\n[Symbiop](https://symbiop.com/)\n\nI’m out above Newberg so a bit higher up &amp; colder, would these be fine outside for me or should I put them in a greenhouse?\n\nThey’re fine down to zone 6, so you’re good to put them outside.\n\nChristmas gifts is a wonderful idea.\n\nI would totally treasure a fat pinch of fresh saffron from a friend!\n\nI keep my mom supplied with saffron so she can make her saffron rice.\n\nThere are variations, but her standard is shrimp, smoked sausage, peas, a pack of yellow (aka saffron) rice, garlic, just a little red bell pepper, and a few saffron threads.\n\nNuke water until warm and bloom saffron threads in it.  Brown sliced summer sausage and set aside, then par cook shrimp and set aside as well.  Sweat garlic and bell pepper, add water and rice, and cook covered until a few minutes are left.  Then add peas and sausage, finish cooking the rice, and add the shrimp right near the end.  It's mostly residual heat that finishes cooking the shrimp.\n\nSorry I don't have specific quantities.  I'm sure Mom does because she loves her recipe cards, while I cook more by feel.\n\nAw, recipe cards! I remember my mom’s giant file of them.\n\nTadig \n\nThis is the only thing I've ever used saffron for, and it only gets made once a year, at Christmas. My mother started making this in 1964, the year it was published in Sunset Magazine. She's made at least one batch every year since, and now makes it and mails it to other family households as well (though I make my own so she doesn't have to make even more!). This recipe is why I have a Kitchenaid stand mixer, because 9 cups of flour is a LOT! I usually make it on the 23rd, then shape and bake after dinner on Christmas Eve, so that it's ready to heat and eat for breakfast on Christmas Day. It's not Christmas in our family without this bread!\n\nMostly original recipe follows, but check notes for baking temp and time changes!\n\n**Christmas Tree Bread** (Sunset Magazine, 1964)\n\nIngredients:\n\n1/2 c warm water  \n1/2 -1 tsp Saffron threads, crumbled  \n2 pkgs. or 2 tbsp yeast  \n4 eggs, slightly beaten  \n1 2/3 c evaporated milk (1 large can)  \n1 1/2 c sugar  \n1 c melted, cooled butter  \n1 tsp salt  \n9 c flour, approx.  \nWhole candied cherries for decoration (optional)\n\nAdd saffron to warm water, let steep. In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in water (add a pinch of sugar to proof yeast). Add eggs, evaporated milk, saffron, salt and sugar. Beat with mixer or whip until saffron is diffused. Gradually add 4 1/2 cups flour, beating until dough is smooth and elastic. Stir in butter until blended. Add 4 cups more flour, or enough to make a stiff dough. Sprinkle 1/2 c flour on board turn dough out, cover with bowl, and let rest 15 minutes. Knead until smooth and elastic; add more flour sparingly if needed. Put dough into greased bowl, turn to grease top, cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight or longer. Divide into 3 equal portions. Makes 3 loaves.\n\nFor each tree, roll strands of dough approximately 3/4″ in diameter; shape tree on greased cookie sheet, cover and let rise approximately 25 minutes in a warm place. Decorate with dried cherries and brush with beaten egg if desired. Bake at 400° 25 to 30 minutes. \\*\n\nBranch tree: divide dough for one tree into 16 equal pieces; roll each piece into a 12″ strand. Cut two 5″ pieces from first strand to form top pair of branches; curl one end of each and bring cut ends together at center to form top of tree. Save excess dough. Arrange succeeding pairs of branches so each curled end extends 1/2″ beyond last curl and just touches it. Make 8 or 9 pairs. Roll 8″ long strand of dough to fit below last row of branches – leave ends uncurled. Roll saved dough into three thin strands about 20″ long; braid for trunk.\n\nSpiral tree: divide dough into 22 parts. Roll each piece into a 6″ strand. Turn 21 strands into snail coils; arrange coils into pyramid, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Curl remaining strand into “S” shape for trunk. \\*\\*\n\nScroll tree: roll pieces of dough into 1 each: 6″, 8″, 10,” 12″, 14″, and 16″ lengths, reserving trimmings. Curl both ends of each strand. Shape 6″ strand into tree top with ends just slightly curled. Place next longest strand beneath first so that curled ends just touch first and extend approximately 3/4″ beyond. Repeat with each succeeding strand until all are used. With reserved dough and trimmings, make “S” shaped trunk and place at base of tree. Also curl “snails” and center between branches.\n\n\\***Big note here: I bake at 375° for 18 minutes otherwise it’s overdone! I have no idea why it’s so different from the recipe, but there it is. My mom bakes hers at 350° for 15 minutes, but she is at a higher altitude than I. We've also decided that the difference in baking instructions has to do with changes in ovens over the last 60 years. :-)**  \n\\*\\*Another note: The Spiral Tree is the only shape I ever make, because it's just easy to shape, divide and serve that way. I don’t have pics of any of the shapes, and the article that probably had pics is long gone.\n\n  \nP.S. Amazing haul of saffron threads you have there! I have a black thumb, and I'm jealous!\n\nThank you! It’s super easy to grow, at least where I live. All I did was plant the corms and that’s it.\n\nI hope you don't mine me asking where you're at and what your climate is like.\n\nEdited : other comment by OP said pnw\n\nI’m gonna try this! Do you have any pictures of what it looks like when it’s done? What does your tree look like?\n\nWell, I have a couple of pictures that will give you an idea, but that was not a good year for the rising! I let it rise a bit too much, so it wasn't as defined as usual (I'm not that great at baking!), but still tasted great. Here is the first anyway (I'll put another in a separate comment:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/58ehobvbzi3e1.jpeg?width=200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b645973eb33b4a889516d587f16eb1634b052b4a\n\nPicture 2: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o67fcdapzi3e1.jpeg?width=450&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb953d8d7b613f68c16ded226f1aa807643dd8a6\n\nI love it! Thank you!\n\nSince I've finally gotten to it, here's a picture of what it looks like just after shaping the dough, if it helps:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8thonm612t8e1.jpeg?width=1728&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=341d03f5c9688caa4a571b414d7ac402f3984468\n\nGood luck, and I hope you love it!\n\nBeautiful! Thank you so much for sharing the recipe and pic 😁\n\nLove this! If you like Indian food, saffron is used in biryani and sweets such as kheer (rice pudding), ice cream, and shrikhand (sweetened thick yogurt).\n\nSeconding biryani!! Or our version of the bread pudding: Shahi tukda\n\nIndeed! Shahi tukda is a good one too.\n\nis that double ka meetha??\n\nLots of Indian desserts! Or u could make simple turmeric milk. Hot milk, some stands of saffron in the milk, a pinch of turmeric, honey to taste. Nice warm drink to have before going to sleep.\n\nWhy will you add turmeric to saffron? Turmeric has such an aggressive taste and smell profile, it completely damages the saffron.\n\nI bet, with the appropriate ratio, I can be done yummy.\n\nIt’s called turmeric milk for a reason. \n\nIf you want to add saffron to milk, a better choice would be thandai, a festive drink made with dry fruits, saffron, sweet spices like cardamom, and sometimes cannabis. Or just saffron milk and sweetener.\n\nHaldi doodh isn’t for tasting good, it’s a traditional Ayurvedic treatment. Depending on the formulation and desired effects, you can add saffron, black pepper, and even ginger root for their Ayurvedic properties.\n\nCorrect, it’s not for taste but for health benefits. \n\nSo why waste an ingredient which is more expensive than gold on something which is not drunk for the taste aspect. Better put it in something that is tasty and you can enjoy it instead of having to gulp it down.\n\nWhy waste? They are not wasting it. Certain herbs are meant to be drank together for increased bioavailability. Even if that’s not the case it’s still going in the body, and you’re still getting the health benefits. I’m not classically trained in traditional Indian medicine, but my grandma puts saffron in haldi doodh, so I’m going to continue that. I’m not gonna “save” a couple dollars worth of ingredients for the chance that my medicine doesn’t work. \n\nGet off your high horse, who are you to tell someone what’s right or wrong? If they think a couple strands of saffron might taste good in haldi doodh, fine let them try it. It’s not like they pissed in your cereal.\n\na. You do not understand the science behind it.\n\nb. You say it might not taste good. \n\nc. You still tell someone to try it. \n\nFor what? Not for taste. Also not for health reasons because you say you don’t know if they exist. Then? \n\nYou can of course continue to consume as you please, but I am trying to understand why will you recommend this to others. Help me make sense.\n\n Look up some Persian food recipes. You can bake cake with saffron and cardamom. You can make Sholezard, it's a type of dessert. You can make Joojeh Kabab as someone else mentioned in another comment. You can make tea and add saffron to it. You can cook rice and then mix some saffron with water and add it to your rice. You can use saffron syrup and make a nice cold drink with it.\n\nThank you!\n\nYour welcome\n\nmake rasmalai!!! or make kheer \n\nboth are great desserts\n\nThanks for the suggestions. I was mostly thinking of savory dishes so this helps!\n\nI thought this was a pile of saffron on top of freshly poured pancake batter. I cannot express how relieved I am to realize that's not what I'm looking at. Congrats on the harvest!\n\n🤔 now there’s an idea…\n\nBountifulllllllll 💅\n\nThis would topple entire empires 500 years ago\n\nWOW 🙏\n\nBeautiful! Where do you get your bulbs?\n\nSome rando gave me a bunch of them and the rest I got from a small local nursery. I know Renee’s Garden sells them online, as well as a bunch of other companies.\n\nI’m dying at “some rando” lol\n\nRando Craigslist grandma, to be specific lol\n\nWow, what a blessing! Glad you know what to do with them. Nice haul.\n\nI'm surprised you could plant them this close together and it would still grow\nWas there any spacing you left between the bulbs?\n\nWhen I planted them three years ago, I spaced them all about four to six inches apart. They spread a ton.\n\nEdit: I plan to divide them next summer.\n\nInteresting, thank you\nAnd do they bloom this way every year?\n\nYep! For about three weeks every autumn where I am.\n\nWhat does saffron taste like?\n\nKind of sweet, earthy, and floral. Not really like anything else but good for both savory and sweet foods.\n\nSaffron is so expensive, never thought of growing it oneself… O-O Make some paella op!\n\nBeautiful!\n\nWhere are you located? I want to plant\n\nThey can grow from zones 6-9 or 10. I’m in the PNW US. They are zero maintenance here.\n\nWhere’s the “happy for you” meme?\n\nThat’s amazing, congrats! How many bulbs/flowers did this take?\n\nI forgot to count when I was harvesting, but I’d guess 100.\n\nHow long would this last? I know this is difficult to answer, so I’m open to hearing how it would be used and how much could be done with this quantity.\n\nI don’t use it that often. That’s why I needed ideas. I still had some leftover from last year. This is about 1/4 cup and most recipes seem to use a teaspoon to a tablespoon, so it’s enough for 10-12 recipes.\n\nThe flowers are so pretty! Are they very fragrant?\n\nVery! So much so that I had to dry these in the garage due to my fragrance sensitivity. Guessing it would be pleasant for most people though.\n\nWOW! my saffron didn’t produce at all this year\n\nHopefully next year! I think the first year they came up they made about six flowers. I think a squirrel might have eaten a few corms too.\n\nI was today years old when I learned that saffron came from a type of crocus! So cool!\n\nOmg.  I never even thought.  I COULD grow my own saffron!!  How fun!  I'm gonna try it.\n\nIt’s very easy! I haven’t done anything to maintain them since they bloom in autumn, though I probably should separate them.\n\nWhen you harvest them do you need to replant the next year?\n\nNope! They are perennial from zone 6-9 or 10.\n\nCool!\n\nI see this touted as something to grow, because it's valuable, but never how/who to sell it to?\n\nA farmer’s market or directly to restaurants is how I’d do it if I had really large amounts.\n\nI like saffron in risotto (I make it in a pressure cooker, cooks in 6 minutes) and cod en papillote with garlic lemon butter\n\nThank you! Risotto is so delicious.\n\nBro is sitting on a gold mine!\n\nHow do you prep soil for a garden and plan the garden?\n\n\nNow is the time to get the soil prepped before it freezes I hear and that’s happening quickly and I’m struggling to figure out how to plan .\n\nI’ve been adding leaves, compost, and mulch for years. That’s all I do for prep. \n\nAs far as planning, lol… I have pretty bad ADHD and don’t really plan at all. I tend to just put stuff wherever I think it will be happy and I buy anything that looks interesting. I also have tons of native plants, which a much easier.\n\nI hear you I am a neurodivergent neurodifferent person as well.\n\n\nI like if I don’t have a garden yet of my own and I’m trying to grow one. \n\n\nBetween slopes and grass and rocks how do I find a spot to start small?\n\nWhat do I do with the grass? Do I have to dig it and what if I have physical disabilities? How do I do it? \n\nI’m really special interested in sustainability and regenerative Vermi to permi culture interior exterior designing and developing and principles And advocacy for Neurodiversity.\n\nI would say pick a few plants that you want to grow, fun a spot with the correct lighting, and go from there. One tip I didn’t learn until a few years in was to buy several of each kind of plant, so that if one dies, you still have more. \n\nI removed the grass in my front and back yard by sheet mulching; putting plain cardboard down and then a few inches of mulch or wood chips over it. If it rains a lot where you are, you don’t have to do much else. Otherwise wet the cardboard and then put the mulch on top. You can also add dirt to the top of that if you want to plant right over it. \n\nMy yard has a ton of edible plants, native, and perennials for insects and birds, so we have similar interests.\n\nIt’s not my property so I’m kind of limited.\n\nI was offered some space trying to keep it very small .\n\nI’m thinking since it’s a new build and I have to get the ground prepped before the soil freezes, I’m gonna stick with my worms (still thinking between breeding, composting, and hummus) and sunflowers for this year.\n\n\nFrom what I’ve gathered, I’d like to breed the worms with the intention of soil, amending, composting, and hummus. Idk lol am I on the right track?\n\nWorms are great but using them to improve soil quality can take months to years. You’re probably better off with compost and humus or leaf mould and then adding after you’ve planted. I wouldn’t bother adding any extra amendments.\n\nAlso, what do you do for the slopes and limited space? I’m wondering if missing some messages here.\n\nFor gardening on a slope and without doing tons of work, I’d just make sure the plants that like more water are at the bottom of the slope. \n\nFor limited space, you could try containers and climbing plants that could grow on a trellis.\n\nI have a sub pod mod bed. \n\nI will plant the sub pod mini. \n\nI will fill up the sub pod mod bed with cardboard dirt soil vermi compost and leaf mulch. \n\nI will test the soil.\n\nI like to do the soil amending if need be because I do believe in healthy soil and creating a home for those worms to be welcome to when they arrive.\n\nTime to be classy and make fancy dishes  like saffron mac and cheese.\n\nOr like saffron rice with golden raisin. That one actually is  my go to\n\nOoh, I pretty much love any spin on mac and cheese (as long as it’s vegan). Never thought of this! Thanks!\n\nI know i said it jokingly but I have legit had saffron in max and cheese with some more subtle cheeses and it was real good\n\nPaella 🥘!!!! Also, how much did you grow?\n\nI’m just mad about saffron\n\nI knew Donovan was lurking around here somewhere…\n\nIn the first photo, it looks like you went with “use it all to make a pancake,” and I think that’s awesome.\n\nSomeone else said that! Just bad lighting and ugly plates lol. I’d do it if someone paid me.\n\nI am low class. Probably bottom of the barrel. What does saffron taste like ?\n\nI grow it mostly because I don’t want to pay an absurd amount for it. It has a kind of earthy, floral, but sweet taste.\n\n😍\n\nbeautiful flowers. What zone are you in and any tips on planting them?\n\n8b. My only planting tips are to space them well and mark where you put them for when the leaves die off. I always forget where I plant things and dug them up by accident a ton of times.\n\ndid you plant directly in soil or started early?\n\nI put them right in the ground. They weren’t even dormant since they came from someone else’s yard and they were still fine. I did plant a few at the correct time of year though (early autumn).\n\nWow that's worth so much money\n\nNice. From how many bulbs did you get this yield\n\nSomewhere around 100.\n\nOk color me fascinated\n\nSo this is what makes me pee a lot\n\nyou 1%ers ...  :P\n\nWow!  Bouillabaisse!\n\nOssobuco\n\nWhere do you live?\n\nPNW US, zone 8b\n\nInteresting I thought saffron needed dry environment\n\nI think they mostly need dry conditions in summer when the corms are dormant.\n\nwhat do you make with it?\n\nPRECIOUS!!❤️\n\nNo wayyyy this is INSANE!!!"

    "all_comment_text": "Dear God, I love this so much! I would fill it with plants and a cozy place to read and have tea.\n\nSee you understand! Plants, tea, and a good book! An amazing way to spend the day!\n\n++++ Rains 😍😍😍😍\n\nI’d throw a little sprinkler on for the ambience. I ain’t too proud. 🤣\n\nI read this as raisins and was like ok you do you\n\nyessss!\n\nGosh that sounds amazing\n\nI go with coffee but everything else sounds perfect!\n\nAnd I would have a screwdriver, but the sentiment is the same. 😆🤷‍♀️\n\nIt doesn't have to be either/or! Coffee in the morning, tea in the afternoon, cocktails in the evening. I would never want to leave my reading nook.\n\nDon't limit yourself! You could start with booze in the morning and power through the whole day. This would be a lovely place to pace out.  However one would use this space would be great.\n\nHell, you could even entertain\n\nI would pull out the weeds/plants growing around the moss covered stumps. The moss covered stumps and rocks are cool looking.\n\nI read that as I would smoke and grow weed in it and now looking at your comment I think that was just all me.\n\nExcellent point!!!\n\nTwo things can be true at the same time. Or so my wife tells me— all the time.\n\nShe gets it! Coffee, tea, screwdriver - they aren't mutually exclusive.\n\n[deleted]\n\nI immediately thought Doctor Who 🫣 I was like, I guess you could treat it like a giant Tardis!\n\nNow THATS perfection!\n\nSaaaaaammmme. And a beautiful statue or 2. This would be my backyard dream\n\nCoffee and hammock, book in hand, surrounded by plants. That's the dream.\n\nOoooʻ, hammock! I love it!\n\nThis is what I came to say!\n\nPlease please please save this! Has SO MUCH POTENTIAL!\n\nYes I would do the same! OP is sooooo lucky to have this!\n\nYessss a tea house 1000%!\n\nUgh I can hear it with a little drizzle pitterpattering on the window\n\nA cozy tea room was my first thought, too.\n\nTo add on. They should get one of those awesome Rip van Winkle chairs from Forslund to read their books. \n\nThis is one of those dream scapes. I am so jealous of OP.\n\nWith twinkly lights!\n\nSolar twinkle lights out there (incase you can't get power out there 🤔\n\nI have those for my garden and they're cheap but sooo beautiful and worth it. I want to buy more until I have every pillar of my deck wrapped in twinkly lights\n\nYes. 100% this except coffee instead of tea.\n\nYes! It would make such a stunning tea room. A couple of flowering plants perhaps some creeping thyme if the area is good\n\nThat's exactly what i thought too! Such a great spot\n\nAs would I!!!!\n\nNope.  Nothing can be done.  Best to just bring it to my place.\n\nI'll take that piece of shit off their hands for em\n\nOh my GOD lmao\n\nMy exact response!\n\nMy first thought too\n\nDo you like growing plants or would you want to use it as a greenhouse?  If not, turn it into a sunroom.  Maybe with a seating area and a dining area.\n\nWhy not both?\n\nyeah i mean isn’t a greenhouse just a sunroom for plants? 🤔\n\nI think some folks distinguish between the two as one being a place for starting (sometimes larger) batches of higher zoned/fragile or heat-loving seedlings, and the other being a big glass house where you keep mature plants (either long term or permanently, depending by on size/variety etc)\n\nAt least that’s been my understanding 🤷🏼\n\nDefinitely this. It depends on where you live too. \n\nIt would be far too warm to use as a sitting space where I live most of the year, but would be a wonderful spot to extend the vegetable growing season over the winter and a great spot to start seedlings in winter/early spring.\n\nYes, a green house is typically set up to really control the conditions…heat, swamp cooler, adjustable grow lights, etc.  if growing seedlings, they have less tolerance for any flexibility in the desired conditions.  A sunroom typically does not have the same control over lighting, heat, cold, etc.  a good spot for holding plants because mature plants have more tolerance in the conditions.\n\nNo. \n\nA greenhouse's primary purpose is growing plants, so it may have little or no room for humans to hang out or sit and eat at a dining table as described above. If there's space for humans to do more than just water the plants, that's only a secondary consideration.\n\nA sunroom's primary purpose is a sunny room for humans to enjoy spending time in. It may also be a great place to grow some plants, but that's not its primary purpose. You'd more likely put plants at the edges, to gather sun and decorate but not occupy too much of the space. \n\nThe two share some qualities, and may describe roughly the same physical spaces, but not the same usage choices.\n\nBoth is the way, plants all over plus a seating area perfection!\n\n[deleted]\n\nCan confirm.  I am also deeply jealous.\n\nsame! my first thought was how can some people be so lucky! 😩😩\n\nCan confirm, am eating hat.\n\nMy jealousy is way deeper than yours. 😩🤣\n\nSo envious I’m gonna eat my hat! 😂\n\nI am so envious I already ate one hat, and am starting on the next one.\n\ngosh those hats were even tastier than I expected\n\nKill Colonel Mustard with the lead pipe.\n\nTHANK YOU, this is exactly what one must do in a conservatory.\n\nOK so this is just further confirmation that I have never in my life had an original idea.\n\nYour comment is the one I was searching for in this post.  We need a follow up pic of dead Colonel Mustard in the conservatory to post to r/composting to ask what to do next\n\nMy first thoughts exactly 😂\n\nHad to scroll way to far to find this.\n\n💀💀💀\n\nVisit r/Greenhouses and r/greenhouse for inspiration and ideas. Many conservatory posts in those forums. Gorgeous conservatory. Good luck and best wishes.\n\nOP should cross post to these two subs! Then they can be just as jealous as the rest of us :)\n\nyeah this HAS to become a greenhouse.  i would LOVE to have that thing - jealous doesnt even begin to describe it.  OMG  the plants i could get...\n\nI would grow tomatoes year round in that thing!\n\nthat’s what i do in my conservatory! very scrumptious\n\nUnlikely to be able to grow tomatoes year round unless you also supply supplemental lighting.\n\nYep, I installed grow lights over all of my flower beds at 4ft and 8ft so my plants produce year round, and my flowers always bloom. I have them on a timer and they come on for 30 minutes each night, and that is enough light for all my plants to stay in flower cycle and not revert to veg cycle\n\nGreen tomatoes?\n\nThat is gorgeous. Me personally I would set up a heating unit in there. I live in area with winter. And I would grow in that thing all year long. I’d have corn growing in the middle of freaking snow outside 72° in there. I would have a field day.\n\nThe problem with that for my area is we get dark in the winter also. The sun is out from like 9-4:30. So I would need heat and light\n\nOh man, that would make it even cooler. I would totally throw lights in there too literally be growing 365 days a year I’m jealous I want it. Haha\n\nThis sounds interesting! Here we only get at maximum 4 months a year of summer. The rest it's just chilly and rainy days haha.\nSo it would be amazing to be able to grow crops or have to showel our way up there only to enter a warm cozy space filled with plants.\n\nThank you for the brilliant idea\n\nFYI, you already have grapes growing for you so there's that. They won't taste like store bought grapes, good for wine making and jams, though.\n\nHoly fuck I WISH this was mine!\n\nI hate you. / s\n\nCame here for this.\n\nI was looking for this, so I’ll provide it\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wnao5ff7nend1.jpeg?width=527&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=28a2ee1a784fdd14dca556b6b580774c52b7ea0d\n\nI came here for this post. Thank you. 😆\n\nLove it. Cherish it. Add plants and twinkle lights. Live out the dream of so many women who would love, love, LOVE to own it.\n\nYes add lights.\n\nStep 1. Get a candlestick\n\n\nStep 2. Invite Ms. Peacock over for tea...\n\n\n\n\nI would put a hammock in there and some fragrant plants \n\nA place of Refuge.... a small heater and stove,  comfortable chair, watch the stars especially in winter, read. And portable shelves in early spring for some early planting..taking shelves out for fall and winter\n\nLove this idea! I think ill do something like this along with some herbs and plants growing inside\n\nhttps://vaughan-house.com/\n\ncheck out their story and what they built. It's lovely\n\nOh my gosh, it’s gorgeous!! I love the natural rock element too. My brain is exploding! I would love to have someplace like this just to watch storms at night and read books during the day. First, I’d clean the heck out of the inside and outside, so it had a better chance of looking clean once I was through fixing it up . Make it cozy, of course plants, comfy seating, the whole 9 yards! Wow what an opportunity I sure hope you post an update.\n\nMy name is professor Plum.  I am going to go and get my candlestick.  Please meet me in the conservatory in 10 minutes for a “surprise.”\n\nFirst thing I’d add is a daybed for napping in the garden\n\nThen probably some dwarf citrus, jasmine and other fragrant florals\n\nI’d put a nice outdoor couch in there with lots of plants and a projector/screen. This would make for sone beautiful movie nights outside or a comfy place to read and relax, what a dream\n\nSpend time in it. Get to know it. Get a plant or two and watch how they function inside. Everyone who gardens knows what to do because they simply spend time in their space looking at it. Something in your brain will go \"huh, I would enjoy this particular thing right there\" and then you figure out a way to make it happen.\n\nSimply spend time looking at it.\n\nThis is the best advice ever.\n\nThis is literally my dream come true. I hope you fill it with gorgeous plants and enjoy it daily.\n\nYou must remove it immediately and send it for safe disposal to my house!!! That is awesome!\n\nI’m so jealous but I could imagine it is probably spider laden\n\n&gt;it is probably spider laden\n\nI'm reading that as \"no mosquitos\"\n\nFound the fellow optimist!\n\nI am envious!!!\n\nGrind out the stump, get rid of that overgrown vine, wash every window, check they are tight and secure, make sure the hinges on the windows move smoothly (WD40), either get some pavement stones or renew the gravel floor.  Then you can see about the sun exposure and what you want to grow in this charming, delightful conservatory.\n\nI'd put an outdoor bed in there.  Sleep in it every chance I could.\n\nButterfly/moth garden 😍😍😍😍\n\nLure Mr Body there!\n\nYou could make it a tea garden! Keep a nice tea table in there, but use the wall space to grow teas and fragrant plants that you might not want in an open garden. You could keep mint in there so it doesn't take over your garden.\n\nGive it to me.\nJK clean it up and make it into an orangerie. Get a bunch of citrus and olive trees and make it into a tropical fruit paradise.\n\nTea room or like, reading room? Maybe for like mediation or yoga or something?\n\nGet a long striped scarf and travel through time and space?\n\nOh my god I would kill for that\n\nOh how fun. Show us what you do.\n\nI'd run a little power cable to there, put in a table and a heater and voila you have a heated outdoor space in winter\n\nHooka house, bong home, hot box 😂\n\nGimme. I'm in love with that building! I don't have space for it in my yard but I am severely and sincerely jealous that you have it. Grow plants, have tea or coffee out of the weather, do crafts, sun bathe, whatever. It's gorgeous.\n\nTurn it into a greenhouse! Put a small chair and desk facing towards the nicest view, and chill in it during the winter with a nice book, your pet, and your choice of warm beverage. You could even put a small wood stove in there or something (with an exhaust vent out the window).\n\n*While the pitter-patter of light rain taps on the roof and glass, you're sitting there with freshly made coffee, surrounded by greenery and the small crackle of a small fire. You're bundled up nice and warm and sheltered from the cold, you open your book and dive into another world...*\n\nJust typing this out made me so envious. The possibilities are endless.  It's beautiful!\n\nA boat load of hot boxes. \n\nBut for real, some sort of tropical feel plants like banana tree or birds of paradise that surround a small pond with a waterfall that gives you the babbling brook sound.\n\nGreenhouse,observatory,estuary,bio cube,terrarium or maybe a clubhouse 🤷‍♂️\n\nPlant paradiiisssseeeeeee!!!!!!! Make it a cozy plant space and give yourself comfy chairs for the table\n\nSo many options! I’d definitely use an area to dry my herbs in here. 😍\n\nI would grow those grapes along with melons trained up the inside like a Victorian gardener. Start seeds in there on benches. Grow a handful of tomatoes along the other side and still have some sitting space.\n\nQuiet room, nice big comfy chair lots of plants, table, glass of wine, no sorry bottle of wine. Do not disturb sign on door.\n\nSo many plants!!! Succulents, orchids, vining plants, and a little indoor pond with live-bearers like guppies or mollies and lots of aquatic plants and a heating element for winter like a fake mini fireplace.... So many ideas it would never be finished lol\n\nA little fountain on one corner for background sound\n\nSome people have all the luck!\n\nI would have the garden of my dreams and a cozy hiding place for coffee or cocktails. A cute dinning table, cozy seating area and do I see a little pond area?! Oh my gosh! Pure heaven.\n\nAmazing greenhouse potential!\n\nI don’t think I’ve ever been more jealous! I’d put a hammock in there. And lounge all day\n\nKinda want to do this\n\nStart a carnivorous plant collection\n\nOh how I wish I had this!  It would be my own private space for plants, reading, writing, having my morning coffee or my before dinner glass of wine.  You are so lucky!\n\nI would add a small water feature (wine barrel fountain or something) with some little fish. Add comfy chairs. Run an electrical cord to add fairy lights and a pump for the water feature. Electric kettle and small cabinet for tea. You can sit out there and drink tea in the rain or have a romantic dinner outside at night. Also plant some tropicals that normally don't grow in your area, maybe lure in some geckos or frogs.\n\nYou could also pick a theme and decorate it like that: swamp witch, steampunk, poison garden, fairies, gnomes, Zen, seaside, or a specific biome.\n\nUse it as a sunroom or outdoor eating area.  You could also put a hot tub in it and put up curtains for privacy.\n\nButterfly house.\n\nYou can send it to me and I can grow my tomatoes without the damn deer eating them again.\n\nI would convert into a personal space. Garden furniture, fluffy pillows, table for books tea. 🍵\n\nPerform fucking magic in it? I’m am so jealous\n\nGive it to me\n\nGift it to me!😉\n\nMy brain immediately said “catio”\n\nI would kill  - well, wound at least  - to have that.  I'd fill it with containers of herbs, hanging rows of strawberries and tomatoes all around the sides,  and a big double hammock in the middle,  made luxurious and private by the shade and scent of growing things.\n\nTurn it into an aviary\n\nGreen house or you own personal\nSpace with a comfy chair .\nA hobby room\nA cat house \nLearn massage n have the massages\nOut there \nBecome a fortune teller n have people come there n tell them it's a 1000 bucks to talk to dead people..lol lol\nPut your motorcycle that you just got and keep in there. \nFootball game with your buddies with a keg of beer n sleeping bags so they can sleep over n not drive .\nRent it out as a little apt \nLet us know what you did with it .\nEnjoy n good luck .\n\nShe shed, green house, music/art studio, meditation room, yoga studio, wood shop, reading nook, observatory…so many options!!!\n\nGreenhouse!!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kgis1qtzllnd1.png?width=527&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b08fdfdaad607e3c3648db3fac24485510b1e8a2\n\nWhat COULDN'T you do with it.  What part of the country are you in?\n\nIm in Sweden!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mdq7fua5kfnd1.jpeg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e6f2b01b8e255185e0e5881920975a45b0c983dd\n\nLike this! 😁😍\n\nGreenhouse/sitting area\n\nI’d fill it with plants and somewhere comfy to sit.\n\nGive it to me\n\nConserve it and turn it into a conservedatory\n\nGreenhouse!\n\nHello greenhouse\n\nGreenhouse\n\nI would grow orchids in there…such a beautiful and relaxing area\n\nSorry,  ideas...\n\nWhat's your budget?\n\nRecycled windows, doors, shelving.\n\nLots of potted plants. \n\nMaybe ivy, other vine plants for \"walls.\"\n\nCandles, fairy lights, solar powered.\n\nCanvas for sun cover or walls.\n\nA potting room/ nursery.\n\nLots of choices.\n\nKeep us updated. \n\nEnjoy!\n💜💜💜\n\nOh can I just sit in there forever?\n\nOh the possibilities\n\nPlants and a comfy chair for knitting, of course.\n\nGreen house for the win!!!\n\nI would love a greenhouse to overwinter plants, and start plants! A potting table and a nice place to sit would be lovely...\n\nActually though, given my current health problems, I would probably use this as a place to put a hot tub. They last a lot longer if they are protected from the elements. \nMy back problems love a soak in a hot tub. \nI'd probably surround it with plants though!\n\nHookah lounge\n\nWow. So much potential!\n\nJust stand in there all day and enjoy the beauty I would do art journal yoga enjoy my morning coffee in there. Ughhh\n\nI am so jealous I can't even think of ideas!\n\nLooks like a great place to host dinner parties! Install a couple buffets along the wall, even out/compact the floor, maybe some subflooring, flooring, wet bar, stage it...tables, chairs, perhaps a lounge chair, string lights, put a few plants for ambiance...viola!\n\nGreenhouse!!!!!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rzyios6n4fnd1.jpeg?width=1170&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=23669e88f02c14137ceedb7d5bbfd2108a5cddee\n\nOh wow, I am jealous! I would make it an aviary if it wasn’t too hot with lots of ferns and palm like trees and serve myself a nice cup of coffee while chilling with said birds.\n\nLots of plants in it, a seat, then proceed to get high in all weathers\n\nPersonally I’d put up a fan and some lights if I could, add a rug or a mat under the table, and fill the leftover room with some plants. With all that natural light, I’d make the area comfortable to move around in to make it my own reading and crafting place. Maybe even make it my own art studio. I wouldn’t leave the supplies or anything of what I create in there for the heat and humidity to ruin. I’d probably just bring a cart or a bag full of what I want to bring to and from that place, making a mindful trip to and from my hobbies. \n\nAnyways, that conservatory is beautiful!\n\nFill it with orchids and ferns. And a hammock.\n\nHot tub!!\n\nYou could keep your weed in there.\n\nWorld’s fanciest catio\n\nI'd die to have this...make it a spot to gather with friends or family...plants, comfy chairs and hammock...a place for tea and reading .....ugh so envious\n\nMurder someone in it and see if your friends can guess who did it and with what\n\nCan you fill it with some potted plants and comfy furniture, twinkle lights- and make it a little reading lounge or wine chat spot?\n\nMy gosh that's beautiful.  Joining the hoards of jealous individuals here.  There's so much you could do with that space.  Fairy cottagecore is what it screams to me.\n\nInvite us over to sit under the plants while chatting and sipping tea?\n\nThat would be my dream greenhouse with comfy chairs and books. All the books.\n\nI want this so much 😭\n\nCatio!\n\nCatio.\n\nPut your weed in it.\n\nEwwwwie ew ew, yuck, I have a junk removal company you should definitely let me come pick it up, I’ll even haul it away for free just to be nice (*in my best “definitely not trying to steal it” voice*)\n\nI would use it for my rabbits to have a safe outdoor play area since it would be big enough for me to hang out with them! 🩷\n\nOH MY GOSH!! What an amazing space!!!\n\nYes clean up the yard &amp; plant flowers after you have the whole place painted!  Clean the inside &amp; make it whatever you want be it an office or whatever or perhaps a place for air B&amp;B  or family space!  Have the porch be inviting by adding 2 chairs &amp; a table or whatever makes you feel happy!!!  ENJOY!\n\nIf it was in my backyard I’d take out most of the glass and replace them with screen. Screw mosquitoes. I might be sleeping in a hammock at night on cool weather.\n\nYou could…. Give it to me!\n\nTea garden green house?\n\nMurder Colonel Mustard with a lead pipe?\n\nA Winter garden!!!\n\nConserve it. Conserve the hell out of it.\n\nPlant a few kittens, they’ll grow to love it\n\nPut plants inside it.  Crazy idea, I know.\n\nYou could definitely disassemble it and ship to me. I would take extremely good care of it 😁😁😁\n\n... had to try 😂\n\nMake a greenhouse and grow your own produce . Or maybe plant flowers\n\nWhere do you live?? Can you do citrus?? Just live in it for gods’ sake it’s gorgeous"

The heat is sucking the joy out of gardening.\n\nAll the more reason to get some (tall) trellises going, more shade and natural cooling through plant life! :)\n\nDepends on where you live. If you can afford a house, do you have an HoA? \n\nAnd let's not ignore that companies saw the rise of gardeners during covid and that it stuck. Gardening supplies have been increasing through the roof, like plastic bins and totes did thanks to Pinterest/ lululemon\n\n I saw some shitty shady company is buying up seed companies.\n\nWait, who is buying up seed companies?! If it’s to monopolize the market and control the prices, not cool…\n\nIsn’t that like the whole capitalist game plan?\n\nSo you’re telling me that the REAL secret is to get good at starting up seed companies? :)\n\nI knew a guy in Florida that started 13 companies and within 6 months of starting each one sold them for just under a million each. Retired at like 28.\n\nIt’s a video that is popular right now about a private equity firm buying a seed company. \n\nMonsanto has been doing this for seeds to control genetics of industry farming for a long while. Support your local seed supplier!!\n\nThat’s why I garden at night 😂 it’s too fucking hot these days\n\nThe zones are changing fast and also the weather patterns are getting weirder.\n\nCucumbers and more cucumbers! I garden where it regularly gets over 100-105 F in the summer and cucumbers just thrive in that heat and direct sun.\n\nIt really is. I reckon I've easily spent 1000+ hours on yard/garden projects since moving into this place 5 years ago!\n\nIt's coming along nicely!\n\nSure, but this looks like a good bit of hard work too.\n\nI'd argue that part can also be the most satisfying. I'm certainly sore afterwards, but there's a deep satisfaction after getting some serious Earth-moving done.\n\n*return chicken wire and 2x4s back to homedepot*\n\nThat's funny, my original plan was to use wire mesh as well. I went so far as to buy it all and started installing. Just wasn't satisfied with the result. Went back to the drawing board and found these cross-hatched premade panels, which turned out to be perfect.\n\nWhere did you find them?\n\nThey’re Lattice. Various sizes at most big box home stores\n\nGreat idea and amazing execution! It looks magical. You’ve inspired me to consider a trellis on my yard, thanks!\n\nAgreed, and now I’m thinking the same, but maybe next to my garage, which has a sunny south facing side… I don’t have a shed (yet), but maybe this should be the plan for if/when I do build one.\n\nMy only concern with the tall trellis setup is I know for a fact that around here, wasps would be all over that.\n\nPerfection!  What is the orange vine?\n\nIt's bougainvillea 🤩\n\nLooks amazing, but I guess it wouldn't do well in the northern half of of the U.S.. Anyone have any suggestions for an alternate? This makes me want to cut down the end-of-life trees on my property line and do a trellis.\n\nI have major wheeler trumpet vine growing on a trellis that covers the front of my south-facing home. We were zone 5b and are now zone 6a. The hummingbirds like the flowers, the birds like the berries, and the hard freeze stops it from spreading out of control,\n\nNative Honey Suckle, I have Major Wheeler.  It blooms throughout the summer which is why I went with it, I also get frequent humming bird visitors now, which is fantastic.  I'm in CT, 6a/b border, for reference\n\nI don’t know how north you are but trumpet vine, wisteria or clematis may work?\n\nwisteria is invasive, morning glory is another good option but it’ll choke out anything else\n\nOur native wisteria, Wisteria frutescens, has similar flowers to the Asian invasive but is better behaved.  There is also the bay star-vine, Schisandra glabra, whose natural range is as far north as Kentucky but I find it to be hardy in NE Ohio.  I have both Schisandra chinensis, the magnolia vine, and glabra.  The magnolia vine is vigorous but not invasive.\n\nFruit/food: hardy kiwi berry, scarlet runner beans, grapes, hops\n\n\nFlowers: climbing roses, clematis, honeysuckle, nasturtium\n\nPassion flower\n\nI’ve never seen an orange one! How cool. I come across only purple, pink, and white ones over here\n\nLooks amazing! What is the variant name of your orange Bougainvillea?\n\nIn Australia it's known as \"Orange Glory\"\n\nIs that Flame vine in the last pic?  Going to look great in full bloom if it is.\n\nMine's been flowering since mid April and new buds still appearing (central Waikato, NZ). Frost only hits the top of it if it's not a heavy one, so I'm lucky it's been fairly mild this winter.\n\nThink of all the tomatoes you could grow on that trellis‼️🤤\n\nThis looks amazing!   I have a similar issue with my neighbor’s garage.  It’s just a big ugly wall in the middle of an otherwise lush garden.  I’m adding this to the top of my list of ideas.  Excellent execution!\n\nWOW. How are the posts attached to the ground? I’ve been thinking of doing something similar to this, are those brackets mounted in concrete or something, or just in the dirt?\n\nYep concrete. I used \"High Wind Post Anchors\" and about 100-120kg of concrete per hole.  \nHere's a couple more photos to show what I mean [https://imgur.com/a/vxhI3RE](https://imgur.com/a/vxhI3RE)\n\nI used this guys video to get a feel for the fundamentals. I changed the design but I followed all of his techniques [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PvKDNwSRG8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PvKDNwSRG8)\n\nI would assume in concrete. I hesitate to do a project like this cause post hole digging isn't fun but boy do I want that outcome!\n\nWow that looks incredible!!!\n\nBeautiful and I now hope to try my hands at something like this\n\nJaw dropping! Absolutely amazing!\n\nOh wow that's amazing! How long did it take to grown that lush?\n\nPhotos 6-7 approx 1.5 years. \nPhotos 8-9 approx 3 years\n\nJust came here to say you're awesome. Thank you for the inspiration.\n\nMay I ask cost of materials and hours worked! What a fantastic project.\n\nThe big one was $1300 AUD and a few weekends. This is a few years ago now so probably add 25% if I did it today. Main expense is the lumber. \n\nThe most time consuming part by far was preparing the post anchors. Because the structure so tall I wanted it to have deep supports, which meant a lot of digging and a lot of concrete. The ground here is very hard and each hole took me several hours. \n\nThe smaller one was about $850 and a single weekend (the dirt in that part of the yard is a lot nicer!)\n\nGreat job looks terrific.\n\nFiled away, one day I want to have a workshop and imagine it'll be cheap/unsightly.\n\nStealing this for when I buy a house…it looks absolute beautiful!!\n\nThat looks really beautiful before and after but the only issue I see is how close it is to the building.  I had one next to my garage and the vines were finding their way into my garage.  I had to take it all down because of the damage to my garage.  Gonna try it again but without space in between so I can keep it trimmed up in there.\n\nIt does like to try and find its way into the shed between the wall and the gutter. I climb up there a few times a year to trim it, and while I’m there I redirect any shoots that are trying to be somewhere they shouldn’t. \n\nNot the end of the world if they do get inside though, at least for this shed which has lots of open holes for ventilation by design. I’ve had a few shoots make it inside, I just snip them off and pull them out.\n\nOh so there is a good but of space between.  Our had maybe 12 inches which I could not get between and able to work anything.\n\nThat bougainvillea is so so so BEAUTIFUL!! And absolutely LUSH! I have some really healthy bougainvillea’s but they’re have nowhere near as many flowers as yours, what would you recommend? :)\n\nThat bougainvillea!!! Where abouts do you live? Or if you’re not comfortable sharing that, what zone?\n\nActually stunning, great idea and perfect execution\n\nYou made trellis’s to be proud of!!! Very nice.  To the point I’m rather envious 👍\n\nI love it!\n\nAmazing!\n\nBravo OP! What a fantastic addition.\n\nHow pretty is that!\n\nYou said it was giant, and you lived up to your word. Looks great\n\nMission accomplished!! Fabulous!\n\nWOW! This is stunning! 👏\n\nWhat a lovely hue of orange\n\nDamn good job this is amazing I hope I can create something similar when I finally am able to purchase my own home instead of keep everything in pots. Lol\n\nabsolutely lovely.  really makes me miss my evil bougainvillea\n\nSo cool. What a fantastic idea.\n\nThat’s beautiful!\nWould you be willing to share the plans?\n\nInspirational!!!\n\nThat is fantabulous!\n\nSHEESH, this is gorgeous\n\nGreat work.\n\nHow long did it take for the Bougainvillea to take over like that?\n\nI’m wondering the same, so lovely!\n\nYou must have something super cool hiding in that shed.\n\nI guess you could say usual big shed stuff. Misc storage, small gym, mini fridge etc. Usually half empty so there’s always room to work on projects. Very handy to have.\n\nBeautiful!\n\nBeautiful!\n\nWow!\n\nBeautiful! Great job 💕\n\nIt's beautiful.\n\nnice\n\nVery nice\n\nVery nice!\n\nQuestion: I am doing something similar and I was curious how bad it is to be watering next to the foundation and having damp soil in contact so often?\n\nBeautiful!\n\nWhat’s the orange plant on slides 6-8?? I love seeing those but idk what it is! I recently got a trellis and would love to get some\n\nIt looks like bougainvillea. I believe it’s not cold hardy?\n\nLOVE everything about this\n\nbeautiful!!\n\nBeautiful\n\nSo much better, sheds are bloody ugly, mine has similar but growing right over the top.\n\nA cheaper way way is to ram steel pickets in at either end and wire on steel concreting reinforcement mesh. Its not as pretty at first but with an ornamental grape,  jasmine or bougainvillea it will be covered in 1 - 2 seasons.\n\nNice job!\n\nAmazing!\n\nAwesome! You may have heard this already. But many gardeners have used passion fruit vine. It has pretty flowers and if you’re lucky, fruit!\n\nI’m in love with your trellis! I love the different plants you chose. The rosemary and the other plants nearby look great!! I love rosemary because it’s an evergreen. It smells so good whenever a breeze blows through. It grows so very well, it hearty, and best of all, if you need some fresh rosemary for a recipe- well it’s right there!! I love rosemary salt by the way. You should make yourself some if you haven’t already tried it.\n\nI can always tell when the dogs have been rummaging around near the rosemary, they’ll come inside and bring the smell with them. I love it haha\n\n🥲 it’s glorious\n\n👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼\n\nPhenomenal\n\nLooks great, your dog though looks like they're hiding a deep dark secret.\n\nI like your magpie\n\nLovely job, well done - it looks heaps better and probably much cooler inside too! 🌱\n\nBeautiful. Are you gonna grow some hops? You definitely got the height.\n\nThat looks awesome man, good work.\n\nI like this a lot!\n\nI have a barn with 14'x14' doors, really tall. I thought of building a planter box that ran along the bottom of it, probably only 12\"x8\"x12\" or so and putting string beans in there to climb up the door. I didn't think of it in time this year but maybe next year. I think it'll look pretty cool and function well.\n\nI need one built !!\n\nMission accomplished. It’s stunning and what shed?\n\nOh wow great idea!\n\nIf i ever do something like that again I'll leave enough space to squeeze behind it for both plant and shed maintenance. Rats,  opossums, and other critters love that. Found a surprising number of snakes over the years too, probably looking for rodents. Fortunately i like snakes\n\nThat looks amazing!! Great job!! I love it!\n\n Nice 👍🏻 beautiful results\n\nThat is gorgeous!! Well done. 🙃\n\n🫡 gorgeous. Great work\n\nLooks amazing\n\nAmazing!!!!!\n\nNice job\n\nBeautifully done ✅\n\nBeautiful! \n\nGreat job!\n\nGorgeous 😍\n\nI have a Goldflame red honeysuckle that the hummingbirds love. It would be gorgeous there.\n\nAre those bougainvilleas? How did you do it?!!\n\nBeautiful before and after\n\nWhat did you use plant wise for the trellis?\n\nI love it! 😍\n\nYou did so good with this! It's beautiful.\n\nHow lovely!\n\nCongratulations! You will now have rats and mice every year!\n\nThe good news is you will bring in opossums and local, non-venomous snakes!\n\nEnjoy your new wildlife oasis!\n\nWe don't have opossums, we have possums, and all our snakes are venomous (except pythons I guess, they strangle)."

    "all_comment_text": "[removed]\n\nThank uuu! The zinnias really showed out for me 😁\n\nWell landscaped. You did a great job!\n\nthank you! I’m excited to try something else next year :))\n\nFrom boring to beautiful!\n\nExactly, I’m glad my landlord allowed me to do this haha\n\nGreat to see the grass gone and the wildflowers thriving.\n\nIf I could do away with the entire lawn, I totally would lol but my landlord told me not to go crazy 😭\n\nYou’ve totally proved your skills! Maybe ask to do a little more…then a little more… it makes the whole place look lovely. Really great work in the space you had!\n\nThis is insanely gorgeous! I love when plants are left to grow a little wild and free and not perfectly manicured.\n\nYou’d love my yard. My neighbors are into cement &amp; perfectly cut grass. Think the woman hates me!\n\nIt’s so boring when everyone’s yards look the same like that! Keep your yard fun!\n\nYou did such a great job! So inspiring! Thank you for sharing.\n\nThank you so much! I’m so happy this inspired you :)) check out dollar tree for seeds. That’s how I filled my  space\n\n[deleted]\n\nThank you ☺️\n\nI wish I could make my spaces look like this. I just don't have the touch. This all came from seeds? So beautiful\n\nYes! And it’s totally possible! Well the 2 grass bushes in the front I actually stole from the side of the highway and planted last year, it’s kinda taking over! And the same thing with the long purple flowers, they grew roots over the winter and came back up that’s why you can see I left them after the grass removal in the second pic. \n\nI then bought like 60 packs of seeds from dollar tree (~$17) arranged them in order based on height and sprinkled them. After that I watered 2-3 times a day to keep the seedlings moist and learned what weeds looked like compared to my flowers and pulled them often. Now we’re here. It’s easy I swear, this is my first time! You’ve got this :)\n\nGorgeous, and it suits you house so well!\n\nSuch a cute house and garden! Great work\n\nThank you ☺️ I feel like I’m in animal crossing lol\n\nCurious if you continue to have grass growing and mixing with the flowers? I did the same thing but the grass grew back and was impossible to maintain.\n\nYes I had quite a bit of grass and weeds come back after I sowed all of my seeds so I’d have to spend time pulling them so that they have enough light to grow. It was challenging to keep them out and recently I have been able to keep up with the weeds due to a surgery so I’ve let it go wild. All of my flowers seem pretty well established now tho!\n\nAhh ok! Thanks for the info 😊it looks beautiful!!\n\nNice transformation\n\nLovely design\n\nthank you very much!! Can’t wait to expand next year haha\n\nBeautiful!!! 😍\n\nWell done, it's gorgeous!\n\nIt looks great!\n\nThat looks fantastic! Well done!\n\nBeautiful!! You should be very proud of how it turned out!!\n\nThank you! I am very satisfied and i hope my neighbors love it just as much as I do :))\n\nVery beautiful💐🫶🏽\n\nMy dream! It's so cozy and cute!\n\nYou should be really proud of yourself, that’s fab!\n\nYou could put something climbing and fragrant over the door!\n\nOoooh that would actually be so enchanting\n\nThis is really lovely! And the house is sitting so pretty with all the flowers around.\n\nLooks awesome! Next I would do some planter boxes on your front steps and/or under your windowsill! Such a cute house too! Congratulations!\n\nWindowsill planters are so on my wish list!\n\nThe last photo made me so happy for you, great job 😄\n\nThank you! The constant buzz of pollinators makes me happy\n\nLoving the new garden OP.\n\nwow!!! love this. turned out beautifully.\n\ncoordinated absorbed familiar narrow ludicrous decide strong hunt wine waiting\n\n *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev/home)*\n\nPretty!\n\nWow, it looks beautiful!!!!\n\nThat is so pretty.\n\nAbsolutely stunning!\n\nBeautiful fantastic job\n\nVery beautiful… I love the variety!\n\nThank you! That was the most important thing as well as height and texturally!\n\nThat’s absolutely stunning\n\nI love it. How did you get rid of the grass?\n\nThank you ☺️ I removed all of it over a few days with a single shovel. A great workout but a long, boring process honestly. \n\nI cut rows in the grass as if I was edging out a garden bed and then dug up the strips with my shovel at an angle. They just kinda rolled right up like a carpet.\n\nBeautiful!!!! Great work.\n\nBeautiful\n\nNice\n\nReally lovely! We just bought and the yard has tons of grass and too many flower beds that I don’t want to maintain so I thought about wildflowers like this. What did you plant? Are any of them perennials? Trying to minimize my regular gardening work.\n\nNice congratulations! I bought a ton of seed packets from dollar tree for like 25 cent each and they were all annuals, but I’ll collect the seeds at the end of the season! I have plenty of zinnias which I’m excited to replant each year. There are wildflower mixes on Amazon that are said to work but they don’t have nearly as much variety as I wanted (I saw on review pics) but they do cover a large area! \n\nLaying down cardboard or something like a tarp could kill the grass over the winter I think, not too sure abt some weeds\n\nThe grasses are actually plants that I stole from the side of highways and they are kinda growing too fast and taking over so I don’t recommend those haha! \n\nDid that answer your questions? Pls lmk if you’d like any more advice! I’m so eager for others to have such success\n\nYes that’s good to know! We are trying to find as many low effort things as we can so I think some areas of annual wildflowers will work, but I was looking for a large group of perennial versions as well.\n\nI don’t know too much about perennials yet, but I think coneflowers and black eyed Susan’s spread and grow bigger each year and last for maybe around 7 years…? I suppose thats the definition of a perennial! 😭Ornamental grasses are great too! They fill spaces beautifully and add so much softness. \n\nI failed at transplanting 3 black eyed Susan plants last year but they self seeded I think and grew so BIG this year! I think there are probably triple now. And the blooms last for literal months it feels!\n\nLiriope and daisies are great too, they are on my wishlist. I also bought morning glory seeds but have been told that they are very invasive and choke out other plants but the flowers are very pretty and bloom very often I think\n\nPlease don’t plant morning glory omg 😭 we cannot kill them here\n\ntoo late for me 🫣 I planted some in an isolated little patch in the backyard earlier this summer. Send me your best prayers\n\nOkay, just know that they also kinda spread invisibly underground with runners, a bit like mint. Maybe one of those in-ground dividers/barriers would help protect against things going sideways? If you ever want to remove them in the future, dig around a lot to find all the runners. Those are my tips. Otherwise, enjoy the lovely blooms! A trellis would be lovely.\n\n[deleted]\n\nHey! I was on Amazon for native mixes recently and spent a lot of time digging into the contents of the packets I found. Most of the flower mixes on Amazon actually have a ton of non-natives, but I found *one* that is completely native to the US! It’s **Sow Right Seeds Perennial Wildflower Mix**!\n\nLove the garden ❤️\n\nWonderful transition.\n\nWow that’s beautiful.   Great job 👏\n\nThis is perfect. How lovely!\n\nLooks great 👍 big improvement\n\nLooks stunning, wish I had a little garden 🥹\n\nThis is mostly from dollar tree seed packets! Only costs about 25 cent each as well as a lot of time watering and being patient!\n\nIts lovely\n\nWow - well done! Great eye\n\nthank you very much!\n\n🥰\n\nIt looks amazing!!\n\nWhat flowers are in the front 😍\n\nthe pink ones are called \"semi dwarf pupils zinnias\" according to the package and the small white ones are called \"alyssum carpet of snow\" ☺️\n\nGarden looks good, but has that sidewalk ever been edged?\n\nNope lol I don’t think our weed whacker works too well\n\nIt's so well composed\n\nSuch a lovely change! Looks very nice!\n\nThe last picture made me smile :) very beautiful\n\n👏👏👏\n💜💜💜\n\nThis is awesome! Thanks for sharing, this is inspiring:)\n\nNice\n\nThe design needs height and permanency. Maybe some small evergreen trees on both sides of the steps.\n\nOh I’m already planning more variety for next year. I rent and this is my first garden so I was a bit tame haha. I really love elephant ears and hydrangeas so perhaps I’ll experiment with growing those next season 😁I’m so eager to learn more\n\nOh, you rent. Then I understand that you don't want to spend too much money. \n\nDepend on the landlord you could ask if they want to chip in to increase the curb appeal. Send these pictures to them for the work you have done.\n\nIt's a long shot, but it doesnt hurt to ask.\n\nHe’s soooo cheap haha I’d just be happy if he’d relax and let me do me!\n\nLove this!\n\nAlso check out r/nativeplantgardening\n\nSo beautiful 💗\n\nThis is beautiful\n\nThat's beautiful.\n\nGorgeous! I think r/nolawns would like this too.\n\nPosted there and they love it!\n\nHoly moly. That’s great work. Looks beautiful!\n\nAwesome!!\n\nAbsolutely stunning!! Mine could use your assistance if you're up for another round.\n\nI’m actually thinking of making a YouTube video about this soon! I’ll post in this subreddit if I can :)\n\nNeed something tall in the corner. Tall veronica\n\nSo well done!!! Beautiful.\n\nWow!!! What kind of grasses are those in the front??\n\nI think they are called carex grass. I'm not too sure since I just dug them up from the side of a highway last year! They are pretty but they are spreading very fast lol\n\nFabulous! Great work! Congrats!\n\nOP, what is the purple in the back?\n\nIt’s called purple loosestrife and it’s beautiful but also pretty invasive haha I found some on the side of a highway and dug up a little and it’s taken over a pretty big patch within a year"

    "body": "This was my first season of gardening! \n\nLast summer I bought my first home. The home itself was well maintained but the yard needed a ton of work. My partner and I spent all spring clearing the yard and pruning the trees/bushes and getting rid of invasive plants.\n\nWe planted kale, tomatoes, raspberries, blueberries, sunflowers, zinnias and dahlias as annuals. As well as put in tons of perennials where we cleared out old leaves.\n\nI think my favorite part of growing is the flowers! This past month I’ve really enjoyed cutting flowers and making bouquets for my home and friends.\n\nA couple of lessons I learned:\n\n1. The plants that did the best had better soil conditions \n\n2. Don’t try and plant perennials during the heat of the summer\n\n3. Don’t plant veggies you don’t want to eat\n\nI had zero gardening experience going in and I learned a lot about plants this season.

It's full of poor decisions and franken-trellises. I know I won't attain an aesthetic garden, so next year I'm aiming to grow a long themed garden. Yard beans, trombocino, etc\n\nI think my garden decided to look the part for  Halloween 🕸️ 💀\n\nOh don’t worry! Things are extra spooky where I am. My yard has a handful 100+ year old trees that we’ve been trimming and there are tons of piles everywhere.\n\nWelcome. Gardening changed my life, and I hope it’s something special for you.\n\nBeautiful pics! Beautiful garden!\n\nCongratulations!!! Those Dahlias are killer. Well done!\n\nZinnias &amp; dahlias are two of my favorite, there’s just something very satisfying about flowers from your own garden! Congrats on your first year bounty!\n\nI’m gonna take those lovely flowers and that heart shaped tomato as a good omen that you will have many more beautiful seasons of gardening to come!! Thanks for sharing!\n\nBeautiful. Welcome to the obsession--I mean--club.\n\nCult?!\n\nAnd may you enjoy many more 💜\n\nSo wonderful! Such joyfulness, thanks for sharing!  This really brightened up my sad day tbh 🌱🌿🌻🌻🌼🍅\n\nI hope you are able to continue finding joy into the weekend! I’ve been having some low moments too this week and community has made a huge difference.\n\nThis mfer grew love, I give up\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/yzi4uqxg6tsd1.gif\n\nHaha this is my favorite comment\n\nOmg I thought I recognized you! I follow you on insta. You’re such a badass skier &amp; biker. Congrats on the garden, it’s gorg\n\nThank you! Fun episode cross over 😂\n\n&gt;Don’t plant veggies you don’t want to eat\n\nI learned that last summer (so. much. bok. choi.). What a beautiful flower and a lovely story. Thanks for sharing.\n\nOf course! I made the mistake of planting kale. I like kale but not enough to keep up with the amount that I was growing. Also the aphids were gross.\n\nI think you had a knack for it!! 🪷\n\nIt’s weird for me when my social media overlaps, it’s been sick to watch you send it on the bike. Dahlia’s are beautiful and I really need to get some for next season\n\nHaha it’s funny how small our world is! Thanks! This summer was filled with big sends and big flowers!\n\nAlso this sub has been super helpful! I’ve learned a ton from people here.\n\nthe mtb crossover of the century! I also grew my first garden this year, it feels good to be learning and growing 🌻 any plans for the fall garden? im working on some cabbage and beets\n\nHaha yes! Turns out people who love bikes and dirt love flowers and dirt 😂I don’t have lots of fall plan for planting. Just doing tree work in my yard before it gets really stormy.\n\nSuch a beautiful vibe! I would love to hang out in your garden🩷\n\nDon’t start planting roses now…\n\nSo beautiful. 💚🌼\n\nWonderful!  Congratulations on your garden successes!\n\nYour plants and locs are goals ✨\n\nThank you! I’ve been gardening for one season and I’ve had my locs for six seasons\n\nDo you mind if I ask what general area you live in? Love the trees. And beautiful garden too of course!\n\nI am in the pnw! Thanks melted cheese!\n\nLove these pics and love that heart shaped tomato too! What zone are you in?\n\nIm in the pnw! Near Seattle! It’s currently wet and cold.\n\nLooks incredible! I can't believe you did this in one season.\n\nI have a tendency to get pretty into my special interests! I also learned a ton from this sub and YouTube.\n\nThis isn’t in California right?\n\nNope pnw! Old growth trees though\n\nLooks awesome! Looks like you had a ton of fun!!\n\nGreat season!! Thanks for sharing!! Have Fun!\n\nBeauty-full 😍\n\nLol at #3 - me sitting on a mountain of tomatillos\n\nBeautious!\n\nWhat arevthe flowers you're holding in the first pic? I ❤️ the heart shaped tomatot too! Your garden looks beautiful 😍\n\nI’m not sure what specific name they are but they are dahlias from Costco!\n\nThank you!\n\nSuper excited for you, and also what a **great** first photo!! I adore your hat!\n\nWow\n\nThat is such a cute tomato omg &lt;3 good job on the garden it looks amazing so far!\n\nThis is Beautiful 😍\n\nIsn’t that the cutest darned tomato?! And such beautiful flowers!\n\nOh my god that is so cute the heart shaped tomato 😭🩷\n\nBeautiful!\n\nThe Dahlias 😍  great job!\n\nYou did a great job. Beautiful flowers\n\nYou did great!!\n\nThe first picture is so good, I thought this was an ad 😂\n\nHaha I’m here to sell you my flowers 😂 all part of my scam\n\nIt’s evident you love your plants!! They love you too!! 😭😭✨💕\n\nBeautiful flowers!! I’m finishing up my first gardening season too - it’s been such a therapeutic (learning) experience. I can’t explain the pure joy I feel when a flower seed planted months ago is finally ready to bloom, it’s taught me to appreciate the beauty in little things so much more. I hope your garden brings you joy for years to come 🩵\n\nSame! It’s so rewarding. I am self employed and it’s been great in between big projects. I leave on trips for work and gardening has made me excited to come home.\nTypically spring is my least favorite season because it’s always a big transition in work but gardening has made spring so fun and exciting.\n\nThis is so wholesome 🥰\n\nBeautiful!! You did well !!\n\nSoooo prettyyyyy\n\nThe lil heart shaped tomato omg 🥹♥️\n\nGorgeous and you’re glowing!\n\nYou put so much love into your garden, its loving you right back ❤️🪴\n\nGreat dahlias\n\nSo lovely, thanks for sharing OP.\n\nWow, good start!!!!!Hope to see more posts in the future. Give a general area next time since the US gardening conditions vary so much - Death Valley to Baton Rouge to Maine.\n\nI’m in the pnw! My zone is 8b/8a but I’m in a pretty wooded area on a hill, so I think I get more weather than the rest of the town I live in.\n\nLovely area! It is so strange that it is a full zone warmer than my garden in SE PA. We are in dire drought right now, not the entire state but my particular area.\n\nThis is precious! 🌻🫶\n\nI feel jealous in the most positive matter\n\nYour vibes are immaculate&lt;3333 I love the heart tomato🥺\n\nSo cute!!!\n\nSo beautiful!\n\nFor your first season, you did a beautiful job!\n\nGreat advice! I am a fan of planting many things in the later fall, when it is cool, and plants dormant. (Often cheap too!)\n\n🌸Your garden 🪴 is beautiful 🤩\n\nIsn’t it awesome?  Enjoy!\n\nI really appreciate how happy you look. Congratulations on finding something you enjoy!\n\nAw… that heart tomato! And everything else. Lovely.\n\nGood for you! Welcome to the club! Everything is beautiful\n\nHa, thought I recognized you in that first photo! I've followed you for a while on IG for the awesome outdoor activities you do. Sick heart-shaped tomato!\n\nAwww thanks! I’ve learned so much from this sub. It’s so cool to have so much crossover between communities\n\nI'm a ski guide in BC and was at a rave this summer and met an artist who is also a guide who makes psychedelic art with a ski mountaineering flavor to it, the crossovers you can encounter are totally fun. And my main job is making organic fertilizer, so lots of growing and gardening in my day to day life.\n\nAnyways cheers Brooky, keep on living what looks like a fulfilling PNW lifestyle!\n\nFlowers (and other resilient perennials) bring me so much joy, too. I’ve been ticking along in my yard for eight years now and I love to stop and enjoy the plants.\n\nLooks like a heaven! Awesome!\n\nWheee all so pretty\n\nTHE HEART TOMATO\n\nLovely! 😍\n\nAwww yay!!\n\nYou have a gorgeous smile! And beautiful flowers too!\n\nYou are so pretty!! 🫶🏽 &amp; I love your little house in the back 🥺🥰 happy gardening!!\n\nIt looks like you had a lot of fun and I love how your garden came out!\n\nIt always does my heart good to see young people get into gardening. I’ve been a gardener for 45 years and it brings me as much joy now as it did when I first started.\n\nI ❤️ zinnias. Such an easy head turner !! No one just walks past and so easy to grow !! Beautiful display!!\n\nThe second season of a Dahlia usually presents with thick full petals blooms!!!\n\nCongratulations on your new home!  Bravo to your hard work of reclaiming the yard.  May this be the first of many happy gardening seasons for you.\n\nOmg the tomatoooooeeeee ❤️\n\nThese are beautiful! 🤩🤩🤩\n\nDruski love to see you coming around\n\n🪷\n\nGreat work! The smile says it all:)\n\nWell done, this makes my heart happy!\n\nBeautiful ❤️ Lovely garden\n\nBeautiful!\n\nBeautiful!\n\nBeautiful\n\nThe colors in the sixth photo (the yellow flower) are really really gorgeous. All nice shots\n\nProud of you OP! Your garden is lovely 😍\n\nWell done. Welcome to the garden.\n\nGreat advice RE: perennials. My black eyed Susan got absolutely roasted by the summer heat\n\nThey were so lovely!\n\n[deleted]\n\nYou already know it ✊🏽"

    "all_comment_text": "Breeding more soldiers for the war...lol\n\nKeep calm and carry on.\n\nKeep calm and cum on.\n\nYep.  Looked at the problem and said 'yeah, we're going to need reinforcements for this job'.\n\nThose are veterans.. they're in retirement having already served.\n\nThey are in ladybugs’ version of The Villages.\n\nThis\n\nSo they are going to vote for President BugSpray.\n\nThey are trusting the next generation to make the garden great again ;)\n\nThey're the government employees, like me. They're pacing themselves. 😂\n\nJob security lol.\n\nSparta will need sons\n\nBut...They are all lady bugs.\n\nI used to help teach a gardening class for kindergarteners. We always handed out ladybug fact sheets, and one of the facts was that ladybugs are not all female. A surprising number of the parents were confused by that, so it was not shocking  that the kids were as well.\n\nEdit, because people seem to be interested: The male ladybugs tend to be smaller than the females, but otherwise they look similar. You would need a microscope to know for sure which is which, unless you see them mating.\n\nThat the parents thought they were all females speaks volumes about our educational status for the sciences.  Yes I'm aware of parthenogenesis, frogs changing genders based on populations, and clown fish changing genders with age.  But, the basic is still a need for two sexes (except the relatively rare parthenogenesis).  Thanks for teaching science at whatever level.  We need more like you!!!  Bravo (likely brava but whichever....lol....funny due to topic!)\n\nI am a Kindergarten teacher I once had a mother write to me shocked to learn that the moon doesn’t actually glow, it’s reflecting the sun- she came in the next day and I actually had to pull out our globe and a tennis ball and a flashlight and explain that and also that the different versions of the moon are due to way it orbits the earth. She was dumbfounded. This was a 5 figure a year private school btw.\n\nPlease don’t tell anyone the phases of the moon are caused by Earth’s shadow! The different phases of the moon are not caused by Earth’s shadow on the moon (Earth’s shadow on the moon is aka a lunar eclipse, and that only happens during the full moon phase, and it doesn’t happen every month. The moon is usually above/below the plane of the sun and Earth, which is why we don’t have lunar eclipses every month.) \n\nThe different phases of the moon are actually caused by the moon’s shadow on itself. The sun can only illuminate the half of the moon that’s facing it, and the half that’s facing away from the sun is in shadow. Because the moon moves around Earth over the course of a month, we can see different combinations of the part of the moon that’s illuminated and the part that’s not. \n\nWhen the sun, moon, and Earth are in a line S-M-E, the moon is between the sun and the Earth, so we cannot see the illuminated side of the moon. This is a New Moon phase. (Again, the moon is slightly above/below the plane of the Earth/sun, which is why we don’t have a solar eclipse every New Moon). When the three bodies are in a line S-E-M, Earth is facing the illuminated side of the moon and we see a Full Moon. When the three bodies form a right angle, from Earth we can see half of the lit side and half of the dark side of the moon, which gives us the First and Third Quarter phases of the moon.\n\nThank you- I corrected it!\n\nTell me your a 'trophy wife' without telling me...\n\nTbh if I knew absolutely nothing about ladybugs I wouldn't be surprised if they were highly sexually dimorphic like peacocks or anglerfish, and males are a different type of bug or a form or something. It would be weird they were called lady before we had a way to determine their sex, but they're also not birds.\n\nWait, so they can be half male and half female?\n\nAnd to decide who gets inseminated they have a [fencing contest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penis_fencing).\n\nWhy don't they teach this in school? So fascinating!\n\nSome schools do! My daughter’s Waldorf school is all about nature. I wish they had more schools like ours!\n\nI don't want to click that link because I have heard of the term \"traumatic insemination\".\n\nIf all are female, then none are female? For they would be unisex\n\nI don't know. I try to respect their privacy.\n\nWell I guess that’s true!  Good point.\n\nLife…uh..finds a way\n\nFun fact, ladybugs are not called ladybugs because they’re all female. They were named after the Virgin Mary ladybugs have both male and female genders in their species.🤓\n\n\"...blessed art thou among bugs, and blessed are the fruits that we got because you ate all the damn aphids...\"\n\nEwww gross\n\nThose horny little lady bugs lol\n\n\"We're severely outnumbered!!\"\n\n\"...for now.\"\n\nOoohhh. They’re humping?? There’s a massive cluster of ladybugs on one of my trees. I was wondering what they were doing. Nasty little hoes were having an orgy!\n\nVery unlady like IMO... But NGL it's kinda hot..\n\nThe children will eat ten times the aphids so reaaaally true\n\nrecruitment is a very important part of managment. It is good when managers put the effort in to boost employee numbers.\n\nThey're like fuck that! We'll eat later!\n\nhahaha\n\nThey looked at the problem and went- We need more help. These will be great food for our children.\n\nThe ladybugs been watching too much fifty shades of grey lately 😂\n\nFifty Shades of Polka Dots\n\nHaha! even better\n\nHmm, maybe their offspring will be hungry?\n\nThe larvae eat more than the adults, they know what they’re doing haha\n\nso trueee\n\nFree love and an all-you-can-eat buffet. They're living the life.\n\nfirst we fuck, and then we fight, and we will feast\n\nNew series from the creators of Hot Ones....\n\nAn orgy with a buffet.\n\nIs the password oooooorrrgy?\n\nOooooorrrgy1! actually.\n\nI appreciate the use of capital, lowercase, numbers, and non l-alphanumeric characters. And it's more than 8 letters!\n\nThis is a solid password \n\nUnfortunately the creator wrote it down on a sticky note under the keyboard and now anyone can gain access\n\nAs intended. Welcome to the orgy, buddy!\n\n“Guys, this is more than we can handle. You know what to do. Make the babies…”\n\nIt’s like The Cat in the Hat Comes Back. This mess is too big! They need Little Ladybugs A through Z!\n\nThey’re bringing in reinforcements “THERES TOO MANY OF THEM WE NEED MORE MEN!!”\n\nMore ladies 😂\n\nMore, Them!\n\nSEND DUDES\n\nThe larva are more ferocious eaters than their adult forms.\n\nThey are both frustratingly useless and often don’t finish the job.  The problem is, they don’t have great prey seeking, so they will eat a few, and then wander off.  The adults have wings, so “wander off” means “leave your garden”, while the larvae are stuck trying to find another aphid, so they are more effective.\n\nBut ultimately buying ladybugs is kind of a scam.  Having lady bugs in your garden is great, but releasing ladybugs doesn’t really do that, it means your whole town now has more ladybugs.\n\nI like lacewings, they seem to be more reliable.\n\nPraying mantis seem to be more effective at eating bugs. A few years ago one landed on my car around the time some kind of flying bug might have been ant or termite mating season. Anyways these bugs kept landing on my car too, and the mantis looked at it like it was a buffet table\n\nJumping spiders are so quick and efficient as well.\n\nI watched a tiny jumping spider take down an entire cicada a few years ago\n\nFast af boi\n\nWhen I bought ladybirds via mail, they came with net sleeves so you could confine the ladybirds in with what you wanted eaten for a week or so.\n\nHuh, interesting idea, did it work?  I don’t think that’s a great idea, because while you might get that stem, you could have done that by hand for less work, and it won’t touch the rest of the garden, including those other aphids that will rapidly recolonize.\n\nI think the use for buying ladybugs is more for larger farms where the ladybugs will wander off to another plant. For smaller gardens it's best to attract them with plants with nectar for them and sacrificial plants left with aphids and maybe safe places for winter. This year I left some plants growing by the fence and they've consumed almost all of the aphids on the surrounding trees that would normally be swarmed and dripping everywhere by now.\n\nLarger farms know better and don’t buy ladybugs.  We buy lacewings if we want that sort of biocontrol.  Also, if you’ve ever had thrips problems, check out brown lacewings.  Basically solved it in a 7 acre Rhododendron garden.\n\nImagine the terror watching them bang before eating you alive lol\n\nAs if aphids gaf about anything but sucking plants dry lol\n\n🤣🤣\n\nWorkin' up an appetite!!  Not being judgmental but I'm thinking that might be a guy AND a girl though and not just the guys?  Definitely not 2 females unless.......\n\n*Thinking of you’s working up my appetite  \nLooking forward to a little afternoon delight  \nRubbing sticks and stones together makes the  sparks ingite  \nAnd the thought of loving you is getting so  \nexciting*\n\nSky rockets in flight and when it's right, it's right!\n\nI don’t know, Ron, that sounds kinda crazy.\n\nHonestly, Nat Geo photo of the year\n\nI enjoy that position, too\n\nIt's only a 15 minute lunch boss! 💜\n\nTrust me they’ll be so hungry after that, gonna need a bug sandwich\n\nWhat do you mean? This is my job!\n\nLet's get it on!!!\n\nHere's an up vote for the Marvin Gaye reference\n\n*bwah bwah bwah BWAHHHH*  \nI’ve been really tryyyying baaayyybey…\n\nTryin to hooold back this feeling for sooo loooooooong\n\nAphid larvae eat 10x more than the adults, they are working hard on making those larvae for you.\n\nPls tag this NSFW\n\nLiteral Union break\n\nThey’re like holy shit. We gonna need some help asap! 😂\n\nWork-life balance, c’mon\n\nThis is what you want. The offspring eat substantially more than the adults.\n\nan orgy?! that’s crazy 🤣\n\nTypical guy stuff …changing the brakes on your truck …10 seconds goes by …time for a BJ …doesn’t matter if the wife is out hunting lunch or washing clothes …it’s game time !!! And we’re scoring a touchdown!!!\n\nThey’re getting reinforcements\n\nThe babies eat more than the adults.\n\nCalling in reinforcements!\n\nThe larvae eat aphids too by the way.\n\nCalling for reinforcements.\n\nPretty typical soldiers tbh.\n\nThey have two jobs, and one is better than food looks like ( :\n\nWork hard, play harder\n\nSomething about this caption is making me laugh so hard.  Tired supervisor energy.\n\nFucking ladybugs!\n\nOMG it's beetle gangbang. On my internet.\n\nWell if they’re like my husband they will want a snack afterwards\n\n😂😂😂\n\nThey're making more to beat them aphids! Plus, think of it as \"an aphid sandwich after the deed\" 🤷‍♀️\n\nTheyre just blowing off some steam between waves of killing.\n\nSave the dahlias!\n\nWhat are the little black bugs?\n\nThey are making a strategical move, Queens baby gambit underway \nDon’t disturb 😁\n\nThe babies are the real aphid eaters. They're doing exactly what you want them to be doing.\n\n🐞:\"Do you not want more of us, Jared?\"\n\nIt's mostly the larvae that eat aphids.\n\nMaking a bigger and stronger army 😆\n\nF*ckin' ladybugs!!!!\n\nHahaha shit those lady bugs are taking a day off. \nI hate the lady bug theory anyway. Buy some aphid killer from a store and spray them to their death\n\nwhat if my job is to care about and for the world around me where I see injustice nearly everywhere I look?\n\nFunny!!!  Can’t blame em. I’d rather breed than feed.\n\nThey're doing that there because they know their offspring will have food when they emerge :)\n\nI just caught two pair this morning\n\n\"SOLDIERS, FORM RANKS AND MATE\"  - Ladybug version of Leonidas.\n\nFocus is locked in\n\n🤣🤣🤣  Seriously!\n\n\"Hey you guys, quit screwing around! \n\n\n\n\n... oh.\"\n\nOrder some lacewing larvae. They eat aphids at much higher rates and don’t fly away to migrate.\n\nI found 2 lacewings in my house a couple weeks ago. Hopefully that means there are more outside in my garden. \n\nI'd also like to look into ordering beneficial insects/larvae. Have you purchased before/have any recommendations?\n\nWhen I got a large infestation on my pea plants I ordered lacewing larvae from [Arbico Organics](https://www.arbico-organics.com/product/green-lacewing-larvae-chrysoperla-rufilabris/Green-Lacewings-chrysoperla-beneficial-insects) and after I sprinkled them around the aphids were completely gone in 5 days and haven’t returned yet. Adult lacewings don’t eat aphids but instead of migrating away like ladybugs do they lay eggs and start the lifecycle again. A more economical option is to buy lacewing eggs at the beginning of the season to head the aphids off.\n\nThank you so much! I will definitely look into that for the future. That's awesome they worked so well for you.\n\nShipping costs are pricey since they have to be overnighted, but I was amazed how effective they were when I released them.\n\nI just looked, it is pricey to ship. But I feel the investment is worth it!\n\nLol!\n\n😂😂😂\n\nStrength in numbers for the bad guys there\n\nFamily first.\n\nTrying to make more reinforcement\n\nHahaha! This could be a good thing. When they’re done, they’ll be hungry, and their growing babies will be even hungrier!\n\nThis is a good thing\n\nA good laugh, thanks!!\n\nIt's part of their job\n\nLmao this is so funny\n\nThey need to create more larvae to help eat them\n\nWell, where is the best place to meet a mate? People often suggest going to a place where you can meet those with the  same interests and tastes as you have. Well they did.\n\nThey have won the battle but our children will win the war.\n\nI LOL’ed\n\n😂\n\nTheir job is to make more ladybugs though\n\nOmg it’s an orgy\n\nThey will have an appetite after their afternoon delight\n\nThey're calling in backups!\n\nIts a flex to demoralise the enemy :D\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0k7emu58uxbd1.png?width=3024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3308a41513654dc57bab9fc3700a1a28ac12bcdf\n\nTrès bon produit et sécuritaire\n\nTheyre just bringing in reimforcements.\n\nWhat plant is this?\n\nDahlia Seattle 👍\n\nNice I thought a Dahlia of some kind. One of if my faves\n\nNot when there are boots to be knocked!\n\nEveryone likes a snack after sex!\n\nLol. Pleasantly pleased when I opened the pic.\n\nThere’s black aphids??? My eyes can never unsee this.\n\nHaha why? What colour aphids do you have? 🤔\n\nThe ones in my region are green! A bit harder to notice until they are taking over your plant 🤣 I appreciate that yours are clear as day.\n\nEat-fuck-sleep-repeat\n\n😂😂😂\n\nThey’re thinking about the future. Strategic.\n\nThey realized they needed more help and are multiplying as quick as they can.\n\nThey got it wrong way\n\nThey're calling for backup\n\nSEC be like\n\nThey look pretty focused \n\nThose Ladybugs need to get busy eating those aphids!!\n\nThey are more focused on mating than eating... The eating frenzy will soon happen... 😂\n\nOmg that’s excellent 🤣\n\n🤣\n\nDinner date.\n\nThis made me smile and have a good chortle. Thank you for sharing\n\nLol\n\nPerfect place for love making - right next to your favourite snacks.\n\nThis is a hiring event.\n\nAt least your hung around mine all said fuck it and left\n\nThey’re trying to reinforce the army\n\nGangbang in full effect\n\nWork hard, play hard\n\nI mean all the good Roman orgies had buffets…….. don’t hate! /s\n\nNookie break\n\nlol!  Best gardening laugh post ever!  😂\n\nThats funny\n\nI took the title personally... till i saw the picture XD\n\nThe larvae eat more than the adults. This is the orgy before the feasting. Bugs are weird."

Gardener/poster needs to edit the title.\n\nviewers need to move on from a spelling error.  first day online?\n\nIt’s not a spelling error.  It’s a word usage error.  And, the contributor CAN change it..  Editing is simplified on Reddit.\n\nYou actually cant edit a title on reddit once it's been submitted... However this doesnt matter anyways since OP stole this photo from someone else.\n\nlol..  I’ve seen a lot of that..  there L’s one where a gecko is spread-eagle that pops up in “longdistancerelationship” that is pretty funny but plagiarized..  like Biden.\n\nMy sister says “anyways”..  she’s my favorite person."

But great job on the pumpkin!\n\nI was going to say he's sobbing because his parents are making him kill his pumpkin 😂\n\n\"You didn't tell me you were gonna kill it!!!\"\n\nIt's time for him to go up to that great big pumpkin patch in the sky.\n\nHe made the mistake of giving the pumpkin a name.\n\nTrue lol\n\nTears of joy from a great harvest.\n\nYes that one too\n\nAw, buddy, that's nothing to be sad about. The sun is neat.\n\nThe sun is neat! Thank you for the giggle! Ha\n\nThe sun gives us pumpkins &lt;3\n\nShut up about the sun!\n\nLOL this is so funny but your pumpkin is so cute\n\nYou also look a lot like Adam Driver so further congratulations are in order\n\nMakes more sense, but within 3 seconds of looking at this picture I developed the head-canon that you were so overwhelmed with pride at the result of your first pumpkin (it is glorious), that you could barely contain your tears, much like a fresh father holding his newborn daughter for the first time, in awe that he could create something so perfect. \n\nI will accept no other narrative.\n\nThere's no *crying* in pumpkins!\n\nCrying from joy?\n\nI also thought it was from joy...Like a proud pumpkin mom at graduation lmao\n\nBut since I read the \"looks like your family is held hostage\" or \"your parents are making you kill your pumpkin\" comments...I'm feeling those more :p\n\nNever knew the sun was so mean 😥 /j\n\nThat does suck. \n\nI mean the sun is REALLY big.\n\nIt hurt coming out\n\nLol!! “I’m traumatized by my accomplishment!” 😂😂\n\nLooks like an NPC from Zelda when you walk onto his prized pumpkin patch.\n\nThat pained expression should resolve, just gave birth to a healthy pumpkin is all\n\nHe’s holding the pumpkin of despair and anguish\n\nWhen you have to put your pumpkin down…\n\nI thought they were just really happy with their pumpkin- tears of joy lol\n\nFirst thing I noticed haha he is like “I’m going to sacrifice my beloved pumpkin”\n\nPicking your first pumpkin can be quite an emotional process...\n\nI wish I had friends who would subject me to their gardening hobby\n\nMy friend is very easily intrigued so all i had to do was give him a propagule from my annual houseplant pruning and he was obsessed. By sheer luck there happened to be a huge garden plot behind his house that had forgotten about for 3 years. So we began a dastardly plan to start a home garden\n\nThat’s awesome! Can I ask how long it took to turn orange? Feels like I’ve been waiting a lifetime on mine 😅 I live in the desert though so no frost 👍🏻\n\nNo idea if im being completely honest. Our schedules didnt align very well during the growing season so i had to trust my friend and his family to keep the garden going in my stead. It was planted some time in mid spring and harvested sept 26th in a 6b hardiness zone if that helps at all.\n\nNice! Awesome job.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iy0matguu06e1.jpeg?width=1242&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=90a1f21705cd01feb175a8999b01530c49f2caa2\n\nWhy\n\nHad to\n\nI had no choice\n\n*sigh*\n\nChin up bro\n\nI'm making a similar face in my SIL's wedding pictures. 😆 I am very sensitive to bright light and the photos were taken with the afternoon sun shining directly in our eyes. Some things in life just can't be helped. Hope you enjoyed your pumpkin!\n\nInternet\n\nI loved you in Third Rock From the Sun and Brick, Mr. Golden Rabbit.\n\nI want to frame this!\n\n[deleted]\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0lzqnawub06e1.jpeg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=50b70966d7fdb9a08656f118a6680c471676ad95\n\nHopefully this explains everything\n\nSomeone give this man an award. He grows a mean pumpkin, he's an *artist*, a poet, and he's fucking hysterical.\n\n\"Harbinger of the sun's will\" 🤣\n\nFull disclosure, i didnt draw this i stole it from another thief\n\nI don't know how I've not seen this!\n\nEven still, I'd give you an award. Lovely pumpkin, amusing countenance, and perfectly applied meme.\n\nTyty\n\n😂😂😂\n\nI'm laughing so hard at these comments.\n\nHere take this award xD\n\nFuck. Yes. \n\nI love seeing freshly made ms paint style drawings. Gave me an out loud laugh, thank you.\n\nEdit: Saw about the thievery, don't worry, I like to think of it as curation, thanks again 😁\n\nMe when I harvest the pumpkin of grief and agony\n\nIt appears as though you are already suffering from post partum depression. All jokes aside, congrats on your success! And that's a sexy pumpkin btw. Well done.\n\nIts big you did a good job on it 👍\n\nI honestly have no idea how it managed to get so big, especially when most of its siblings got blossom end rot. Assuming its either beginners luck or it was just the pumpkin of all time\n\nPumpkin of all time for sure….\n\nThe POAT 🎃 pumpkin of all time! Praise be!!\n\nThe first labor of love is usually lifting.\n\nIts always fun to think that in roughly 6 months time it went from a seed no bigger than my thumb, to being able to make a fruit so big i can hardly lift it thats also full of hundreds of those same seeds\n\nAre you tears of joy or tears of heartbreak, you look sad. Lol.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hdsxm7gq116e1.jpeg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=04bcfe07e723d9a404fd2c01784fca03c2c4475e\n\nA little bit of both and a third, more sinister thing\n\nme when i grow a pumpkin and imbue it with the potion of infinite sadness\n\n“A father sheds tears of joy, colorized”\n\nWhere are your legs? Is this why you are upset? I would be too if I was forced to float everywhere I go, too.\n\nThey were weighing me down too much\n\nMe looking at you looking at me\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i84pu511156e1.jpeg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=08e8c570fdaedfe7f1670bc5e70a7453bc06043c\n\nStaring contest of all time\n\nEzra miller from Temu\n\nAlso,  great pumpkin oke\n\nDont you dare compare me to that freak\n\nThis is the correct response to that comment 😂. Congrats on your pumpkin, OP!\n\nYour pumpkin is a winner!!!\n\nBro grew the pumpkin of regret and sorrow\n\nAnd where is said cat photo? 🤔\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a7w89asod26e1.jpeg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=29257261eba145849f878ee906beb2a01e68b8f6\n\nHis name mr president he is very cantankerous\n\nCantankerous is a good word heheheh\n\nPumpkin that gives you excruciating pain when you hold it\n\nWhy do you look so sad dude? How can I help?\n\nOk cool unless I missed it but where at in Idaho are you from? I'm in twin falls. Unless your shirt is just an Idaho shirt and not from or living there? Just curious\n\nIm in the boise metro area, cool to see another idahoan on here :]\n\nYeah for sure! Congrats on the pumpkin as well! I'm going to get ambitious and break ground sometime in March or April on our property and build an elaborate 10-ft tall. Probably 20 ft long greenhouse that will have hydroponics introduced to it with fish because I've read some studies about as long as the fish are fed then their poop is fertilizer for the different types and kinds of plants. You can grow in a garden and then be able to make natural heating elements such as recycling plastic water bottles and filling them up with water to harness that heat from the Sun to heat up the greenhouse in the day. It's going to be pretty awesome!\n\nJealous. I would commit several unspeakable atrocities for an opportunity to set something like that up. Best of luck in your endeavors\n\nYeah thanks I appreciate it. I mean you're always welcome to reach out and get to know me. And if by chance you are feeling ambitious, wanted to come down and visit and help build the garden. You could do that also. I'm sure my wife would love it the faster it can get done and she can plant vegetables and herbs and stuff. She would be in hog heaven\n\nIt's huge and must be heavy in weight \n.. congratulations for the Pumpkin 🎃 😍\n\nWhy you look like Snape from Wish on that pic lol\n\nBut to remain serious, that is a really nice pumpkin. Congratulations and have many more bountiful harvests!\n\nthe pic makes it look like you’re crying. i know you probably aren’t, but if you are i hope it’s because you’re so proud of yourself for growing such a nice pumpkin\n\nhey cheer up guy\n\nLooks like you just gave birth to it\n\nWhere is your leg?\n\nYou look overcome with emotion, cradling your pumpkin. A Single Manly Tear might fall\n\nI just love portraits of gardeners with their vegetables. 😂❤️\n\nMf found the pumpkin of agony and despair\n\nharvested the Pumpkin of Anguish\n\nSave the seeds. To replant her babies too!\n\nbro got very emotional\n\nYou &amp; your pumpkin are so cuteeee\n\nMy thoughts exactlyyyy\n\nThat’s the way to go!\n\nWell done!\n\nNice job!!\n\nNow thats cool\n\nNice crop I can’t get the vine borer’s around here to die  anything with a hollow vine around here gets eaten up\n\nThose are tears of joy and pride!\n\nWhy are you sad, Adam Driver? You created life!\n\nYou look thrilled! Looks great!\n\nIncredible pumpkin and awesome, supportive friends?! Double win dude!!!! Sick harvest!\n\nvery painful, I see\n\nare you ok?\n\nAnd first ever hemorrhoid\n\nPretty good size for your first!\n\nI’m concerned\n\nWait a second wait a second wait a second. Are you one of the American High Shorts guys? If not you look just like him lol\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lavouebxd36e1.png?width=801&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=467fe79e6514c04dfa12ad692948f10ea0c7b77f\n\nWe are all printing and framing this photo for the mantel right?\n\ni’ve seen a floating torso before, but never holding a pumpkin\n\nAh I see you have plucked the pumpkin of sadness and fear\n\nWhy do you look like you just physically birthed it\n\nBig heavy stinky baby\n\nIs it your first photograph too ?\n\nGreat job! Also, hope you weren't held at gunpoint by Big Pumpkin or something\n\nThat bastard sun put its radiant splendor on full display right in front of me\n\n&gt;When he wasn’t looking\n\nMakes it seem like you were on call to pop out and distract him anytime he was about to walk near the pumpkin hiding spot.\n\nI grow a few types of pumpkins and gourds. I find them to be very underrated. It’s such much more versatile than people think\n\nThe meat alone can be puréed: I make baby food, pie filling, fruit filling, diced/cubed, sautéed, fried, baked, stir fry, coffee &amp; beverages, soups, pumpkin butter, breads etc, vegetarian burgers, veggie stock, pasta/noodles, or meatballs, even cider and fermented uses… Then you have your skins, seeds, excess water which you can use for some of the stuff above or whatever else \n\nI do recommend exploring other pumpkins line the Peanut Pumpkin and White Pumpkins, some of them are good enough to eat raw if you wanted. Especially if you are someone who is sugar &amp; salt free like am. Otherwise it still needs a little help but the flavor is really unique to each fruit \n\nLooks good\n\nThis really seems like an emotional experience for you.\n\nLucky! Mine was small but cute! I'm gonna start earlier next year!!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gq0wrih8x46e1.jpeg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e49aca846f8fa7590426a76736356db25431039e\n\nFirm believer that size doesnt matter. Biggest lie of the century\n\nYou seem very emotional about this.\n\nAre you sure you didn't birth it?\n\nIt’s huge! Great job. Something ate my pumpkins this year.\n\nI agree with your post. Life is suffering and gardening is the solution to it all.\n\nEveryone is giving you shit for your smile but you are clearly very attractive 🎃\n\nAre you sad about your pumpkin?\n\nAmazing success. How on earth!?  Usually the first try isn't quite so... Awesome.\n\nYou look so…proud? 🤣\n\nWhy do you look so much like Zac Oyama?\n\nDamn i actually do, probably one of the only ones of these i agree with\n\nMango on a fork guy?!\n\nWe look nothing alike lmao\n\nRespectful disagreement.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0zzouyo0r06e1.jpeg?width=1439&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9c1503ddc8583da9b3e372450dda7d2b99b49222\n\nDear lord you might be onto something\n\nEveryone is complaining that you’re looking sad. My first thought was, you look like a younger version of Nicolas Cage (the actor from Face Off?)\n\nSo far the only person i can agree with is the one guy who stopped me in a walmart to tell me i look like liu kang from the 1997 movie\n\nThe best pie pumpkins are actually much smaller.\n\nYea, i definately wouldve been better off just getting one from the store but theres a certain level of statisfaction you get from growing a big ass pumpkin, then making a pie out of it.\n\nThat’s a wonderful pumpkin. If you ever grow butternut squash, they make amazing pies. And they tend to be slightly less attractive to pests.\n\nYou look like Steve Perry\n\nNew worst take ive heard\n\nAw, it's not a bad thing lol he's got a voice like an angel\n\n[removed]\n\nThe sun :[\n\nI am so sorry.\n\nLol tears of Joy errr what\n\nI love this for you, this is amazing! Thank you for sharing!\n\nDid it hurt you?\n\nDon’t cry about it!\n\nYou don't look too happy about it LOL\n\nWhy so glum?\n\nIf I grew that, I would be happy\n\nThat’s a nice pumpkin\n\n1 pie? How big? \n\nOkay Adam Driver\n\nNice!\n\nI bet your cat loves you! 😺\n\nWow that looks great!\n\nhe looks delighted\n\nIt’s perfect!!! Bravo!!\n\nAmazing!!! I need to try growing Pumpkins!\n\nYou’re so worried about it. it’s ok, it looks like a great pumpkin!!!\n\nLooks painful!\n\nGiant punkin\n\nI'm sorry?\n\nWhy so sad bro?\n\nHe looks like it came out of his ass\n\nTears of joy, or being held at gunpoint I can’t tell.\n\nIt's his baby!\n\nFabulous shape. Colour is interesting. Looks delicious\n\nGreat job!\n\nHuge W for huge pumpkin 🎃\n\nWhy are you sad about the pumpkin?\n\nAww how cute!\n\nProud Papa\n\nAwesome!! Pumpkins are so fun to grow!!\n\n\"I said bring me ALL of your pumpkins! \"\n\nThat's awesome\n\nWow🫨\n\nAww he looks just like ya\n\nHes got his mothers eyes\n\nWhy you look sad\n\nWhy is your face like that?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/39t3ha0zl56e1.jpeg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=70ec1aafb129223c34f3169e293a38004ce21907\n\nHope this explains\n\nYou’re hilarious\n\nIt was worth the wait…\n\nbig one\n\nThat's a perfect looking pumpkin right there. You gonna make a pie?"

    "all_comment_text": "I’m thinking of all the tasty potato dishes that can be made haha! Beautiful harvest!\n\nThank you! I definitely didn’t expect such a harvest on my first try!\n\nWow! Are you going to boil 'em, mash 'em, and stick 'em in a stew?\n\nWe will make the Hobbits proud! ☺️\n\nholy cow! how many did you plant?\n\nSomewhere beteeen 20-30. We had a good amount of mushroom compost in the bed, which I believe helped them thrive!\n\nThis has me feeling excited as my potatoes are growing in mostly mushroom compost! They're absolutely enormous, too. Never had plants this big before\n\nIt was so fun to harvest them! We were constantly holding them up to show each other how big some of them got!\n\nThat's definitely the best and most exciting part!\n\nI remember absolutely loving digging up potatoes as a kid! I really wanna grow potatoes again. \nWhy is it so fun to paw through dirt and find edible pebbles?\n\nOkay, I need yall to teach me your ways on potato storage. \n\nHow do you store this many potatoes so they don't start growing eyes? I've read you shouldn't keep them in the fridge due to converting the starch to sugars, but I don't know how accurate that is?\n\nI want this to be me, but I don't know how to store my harvests for long term.\n\nCool, dry place with plenty of airflow. We have baskets in my pantry that we use for storage. It isn’t the perfect temperature condition, but we have had success storing for several months! \n\nWe like to freeze homemade “fries” as well for quick baking. (We use the oven or airfryer so it’s healthier) I add my own seasoning and it’s delicious!\n\nAbsolutely bonker harvest. Are you sure you got all of them?\n\n\nDo yours turn green with storage? I have never grown taters but my grocery store bought ones also turn green.\n\nI had a few that grew green if they were exposed at the top. I haven’t noticed any turning green in storage.\n\nWe searched pretty thoroughly, but I wouldn’t be surprised to find a few plants pop up next year!\n\nDo NOT wash the potatoes; just let them dry and let some of the dirt fall off. You don't want to disturb the thin, delicate skins. Once they are cured, keep them in a humid, dark space with very good air flow at 40-50 F. 45 F is ideal. \n\nHigh humidity 90-95% is important for keeping the tubers long term and preventing drying out. https://spudman.com/article/humidity-control-key-to-storing-bulk-potatoes/\n\nSeems like high humidity might lead them to rot, no? Hard to find a spot that it cool and damp and has good airflow. Airy basement perhaps.\n\nA basement with a fan set up is good, as long as you can monitor for safety.\n\nI have used cardboard boxes with paper or sawdust between the layers. Also ripened the last tomatoes of the year this way\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j08yyw5p01qd1.jpeg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=97c5feb87ae49761993ca05d3e0b27a08b117420\n\nHere's my bounty...\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kiptzjlz05qd1.jpeg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8fe7ab05423f82abd2e51389dcbc6a7e76568aa0\n\nSame energy\n\nNice! I really want to do potatoes! How many did you plant and how much space did you use? ~~In ground or raised bed/pots?~~ Nevermind-I didn't see all the pics at first!\n\nAlas, I live in a big city and don't have much space and I suspect my soil has lead in it (getting it tested this fall), so in ground isn't an option for me. I'm thinking of using grow bags.\n\nI haven’t done grow bags, but I’ve seen where people are able to grow them on apartment balconies!\n\nI used grow bags this year with varying success. Soil quality and drainage are extremely important! Don't use ANY topsoil in grow bags, and if possible keep them raised off the ground for optimal drainage. I used 30% composted sheep manure, quality potting mix, and a bunch of organic slow release fertilizer (heavy on the bone meal). Definitely need to have a trellis plan as well.\n\nGreat tips, thanks!\n\nJust so you don't feel overwhelmed, I'll be perfectly happy to take all your tiny ones. You did really well there. When you say mushroom compost you're saying the blocks that mushrooms are growing from?\n\nIt’s made from the organic materials to grow mushrooms—so it might have been the blocks at some point! We usually get some at the start of gardening season to replenish the soil and it’s done great for us! Tomatoes and squash love it especially.\n\nLookin like Perú over there!\n\nPo tay toes\n\nI find picking potatoes to be so satisfying.\n\nWow what an assortment\n\nThis is the best looking potato haul I've ever seen. Now, I wanna grow an assortment of potatoes, just like you :)\n\nIt’s addictive! I want to do more!\n\nDo you gift them to friends and say “This Spud’s for you.” ❓ Cause I would #dadjokes 🤭\n\nNice! I made purple gnocchi with my purple potatoes this year. My kids thought it was pretty fun.\n\nImpressive\n\nDid you was them? I thought you weren’t supposed to if you planned on storing them.\n\nI sort of “pre-washed” them with the hose to get the big chunks of dirt off but didn’t scrub them. They were about the same amount of dirt that you would have with a store bought potato.\n\nGotcha thanks for the tip.\n\nWow that's a crazy amount of potatoes\n\nWhat zone are you in and when'd you plant them? I'm about to plant some true seed potatos in january (florida)\n\n7B!\n\nah cool, great harvest! i was told to wait til janurary to plant, im in 9b\n\nExciting! I'm going to try potatoes for the first time when my tomatoes finish.\n\nThat looks amazing and satisfying! Great job!\n\nOoh I love the purple. Where did you get the starts for them?\n\nAt a local farmers market! I just saved some so they sprouted and cut them up! They are my favorite! They are supposed to have extra antioxidants too!\n\nI got some too, they’re called blue congo where I live\n\nThat might be their name. The market I got them from just labeled them “purple potatoes.” 😅\n\nOoh, I’ll look that up! Do they taste more like a sweet potato?\n\nNo, quite normal. I had to doomscroll a whole night to find them last year, the only official site who had them for sale (in Norway) withdrew them because of some damage. I got hold of 10, managed to get a small crop and saved some for this year. Did quite a bit of nurturing since they are so rare, the ones I planted in potato buckets and kept in the greenhouse did best. They got bad blisters after harvest, but it dried off.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9sks3mv2b8qd1.jpeg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=866044a11c64cd24fb25558020b8e228e371b51e\n\nThis is typical colouring it adds!\n\nHow bizarre! I think I’ll spend tonight looking for some.\n\nIt is the actual purple that is the healthy part too. Anthocyanins, is the antioxidant that is purple. Same with beets and purple carrots, purple cabage cabbage as well I’m pretty sure.\n\nAmazing!  What’s your storage plan?\n\nThat purple potato looks more like a gem-stone than food. I've never had one of those before, what type of potato are they? Looks like it might me similar to a russet style potato?\n\nI think they taste similar. They are SO pretty! The dark colored potatoes are supposed to have more nutrients, too, if I’m not mistaken!\n\nCongrats, that looks amazing! Now I'm jealousy looking up what is needed to plant potatoes 😄\n\nI honestly had no clue there were so many shades of potatoes.\n\nThere are over 4000 kinds of potatoes, and they come in many shades.  Source: trip to Peru and the International Potato Center.\n\nOoh show us what recipes you make with them\n\nWhen I was young in the 80s when it was potato time dad got out the deep fryer, the only time it came out all year,and made fries in the garage. Best day ever\n\nThat sounds like such a good memory!\n\nFantastic!!\n\nnice job\n\nYou did great\n\nThat's a fantastic harvest!! Makes me REALLY miss having my own vegetable gardens, though\n\nI had no luck with potatoes this year.  Even spent good money getting them shipped from gurneys\n\nYou did awesome!!! Mine was such a small harvest and tiny potatoes hahaha\n\nBeautiful harvest\n\nThose look delicious!!\n\nCongrats! So many spuds!\n\nSpuds!🥔\n\nWow!\n\nHow do you keep the scab down?\n\nWell done!\n\nHey, I'm just newbie here are the really tiny ones like the seeds?\n\nThey are the young potatoes that would have gotten bigger had they been left in the ground! \n\nPotato “seeds” come from the eyes where they sprout.\n\nThat's so awesome! Looks like potato heaven! Them purples, too om nom nom!\n\nThey’re my absolute favorite!\n\nNice haul!\n\nDang, girl…\n\nWowsers!! Great job!\n\nTHIS MAN OR WOMAN POTOATOS\n\nHoly cr@p that's alot of potatoes.   Nice job!\n\nThis spuds for you\n\nA mighty harvest! I want to roast all the teeniest ones!\n\nProud and practical. You will not be hungry in December!\n\nThey look amazingly delicious!\n\nHoly potatoes\n\nThey’re so pretty. Congrats!\n\nSensational\n\nWhy are some so tiny?\n\nDo you have any photos of the area you grew them in or while they were growing?\n\nclearly it went well!\n\nGod, I've seen what you've done to others. \n\nDo the same to my potato plant. Amen. 🙏\n\nOn my third year of growing potatoes and all I got this year were bunny nests. What’s your tater trick, op?\n\nI’m sure I had a TON of beginner’s luck. Our neighbor has several cats that seem to keep rabbits and mice away.\n\nBut we built a 8x4 garden bed 12” deep and filled it with fresh soil and mushroom compost. We planted the seed potatoes a little closer and more plentifully than is recommended, so I was worried they would be too crowded to grow actual potatoes. When the plants were at their fullest, you couldn’t see the soil beneath because they were so thick together. I think the heavy plant coverage provided a great shield to keep the soil moist. \n\nI’m very proud of this harvest, but I also kind of hate that it was so successful my first time because I will hope for something like this every time!\n\nI will try this next season. Thanks for the tip friend.\n\n😍😍😍\n\nWow! What a fantastic haul! You have a green thumb for sure!\n\nWow cool\n\nI am jealous!"

    "all_comment_text": "What a color!\n\nIt's a beautiful color but this plant has seeds that  will find its way into everything.  It also manages to release bucket loads of them as well. I originally  planted them to hide an ugly fence. I've been pulling young plants out of a bed that once housed them since early spring.  I know I could go out there right now and easily find twenty to thirty new seedlings. They also climb/choke the shit out of other plants to find the sun.  Never again.\n\nI MADE THIS MISTAKE TOO! they're killing my\npecan tree now!\n\nWould it be contained in a raised bed or pot, or does it leech out?\n\nThey wind up traveling through various ways, wind, animals and me dragging the dead vines from the front yard to the back yard  compost...\n\nI feel like anyone who plants this should be required to do the yard work in all the yards it takes over!\n\nCotton candy!\n\nExactly what I came to say 🩷🩵\n\nSame! I'm so jealous, OP needs to harvest the seeds and hope they are true!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g0km9s6wirrd1.jpeg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f3a15ea6cce82480f7806b49fa5dd4077da45840\n\nI got a few of those too! I don’t know how it happens, but It’s awesome.\n\nI heard the acidity of the soil can affect their color, so maybe the mechanism is partially blocked by something genetic.\n\nMy wild ones are all purple, but this year I had a couple just like this, too! I was super excited to find them!\n\nEdit: the colors aren't as bright in the pictures for some reason, they're much nicer looking in real life.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ah5120hrqsrd1.jpeg?width=1932&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1dc4ee9913cfcbad7f50571a530663d251f9a5d5\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r7nwbszvqsrd1.jpeg?width=1932&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=de4422a997c96000d3d02ff94d2028f94a94dbf1\n\nOmg it’s like a tie dye morning glory!\n\nIt's just like mice.  There is never just one of them.\n\nCross pollination is my guess\n\nI got some as well!  Mine are opposite from yours however.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s8kgq6g0fesd1.jpeg?width=3072&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=05d0bb855f6d8d4ac6ab8ad08306b8ac923db6fe\n\nI like yours better 🥹🤣\n\nToo kind.  I think both are really cool!\n\nYou won’t think that for long, trust me!\n\nI've never seen this color, it's beautiful 😍\n\nCotton candy flower!!! My jaw dropped. I had to show my husband.\n\nI have m glories too, and they grew in my white Peonies and I had glorious color infusions,. Next season I’ll take pics\n\nThat sounds like a dream garden\n\nSave some seeds!\n\nI would love some of these seeds! Outstanding color ♥️\n\nYou won’t need to, it will be everywhere soon enough!\n\nYum\n\nOuch, my hypertension.\n\nop if you wanna sell us any of those seeds, I'm here interested lol\n\nI have neighbors that have 2 types. One vining on a fence with white flowers, which overtook my brown eyed susans, and another with indigo ones over their front landscaping. I pull these suckers out of my yard. Already deal with creeping charlie. They are pretty but man can they be destructive.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ezbjtdhsftrd1.jpeg?width=2268&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d18bbc4850102d39b27c0f87c75e4900bc8c8da2\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w9qq4267gtrd1.jpeg?width=2268&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6091ec025dd8e74e494465a02fd2f07bf9590519\n\nEasy to pull up but very prolific in a short period of time.\n\nCan we trade seeds?\n\nWhoa, what a gorgeous morning glory!\n\nThis sub never fails to make me smile\n\nI found one today, 1st of the year\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ioq9hpkujsrd1.jpeg?width=3072&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f6c6f3af9bf2e9108e071ce2ad7330e3d93ab954\n\nI absolutely love morning glories and moon flowers! It's beautiful\n\nMother Nature says “Trans rights matter, bitches!”\n\nYaaaas!\n\nWe had one like that this morning but my daughter immediately plucked it haha\n\nSave the seeds, save the seeds!\n\nDef save the seeds. If you can grow this color from the seeds you might be able to own the rights\n\nThat flower grew up in the late 80’s early 90’s.\n\nI hate morning glory with the a white hot intensity. My neighbor planted it and now it’s my life picking it out of my plants so it doesn’t kill everything! I HATE it!\n\nI finally rid my garden of morning glory’s.  They are great but a huge pest in gardens.\n\nHow did you do it? I’ve been trying for over a decade. 😢\n\nScorch with propane torch and cover with newspaper and mulch.  Then crested raised bed garden with all new soil.  So far one year so good.  🤞\n\nInteresting. My approach has been mostly pull and cry, pull and cry, pull and cry and then drink.\n\nDrinking helps ☝️\n\nGorgeous\n\nThis is sooo pretty\n\nLooks like this species I think. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipomoea_hederacea\n\nWhat’s the story?\n\nThis is SOOOOO pretty!!\n\nWow, stunning! I’d press it if I were you!\n\nBeautiful 🌸\n\nI wonder if it might be slowly reverting back to a more wild variety? Very beautiful!\n\nThat's pretty!\n\nastonishing how it grow out of a Lillie. Cool I say!\n\nThat is SO pretty 😍\n\nI've gotten a volunteer morning glory growing out of a lilly plant too this fall! Mine is more blue/purple. A fun surprise for sure!\n\nAh , the surprise that keeps on surprising.\n\nBeautiful!\n\nabsolutely gorgeous omg😍🥰\n\nLike a dew hoar.\n\nSo pretty\n\nhow beautiful !\n\nAbsolutely stunning 😍\n\nThat’s beautiful!\n\nThe satisfaction of pulling them out by the roots and burying them six''underground had left my body, a long time ago.\n\nWow\n\nThat colour is stunning\n\nBella\n\nWow!\n\nThats Rad!!!\n\nGorgeous but I will never ever have these in my garden. My mother planted morning glories in hers and they took over! We didn't manage to eradicate them after over 10 years in that house\n\nLove the color! Blue and pink combinations In flowers looks stunning!\n\nThey turn purplish due to cold.\n\nLooks like a tuft of cotton candy! Pretty\n\n🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩\n\nNice one!\n\nAll your dreams are made.....\n\nLove morning glories, they also draw in hummingbirds. Used to sit on my grandparents back porch and watch them feed on the flowers.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kae8fq8q41sd1.jpeg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=35afd80ab606058a243dd585857e5b37309f27ca\n\nThey have done well for me In containers.  I dead head as much as I can.  We haven’t had them come back yet, but they will take over if you let them…\n\nAlso morning glories cross pollinate very easily.  We had ones start with heart shape leaves and end with sweet potato vine type leaves.  It prob cross pollinated and is returning as a different variety\n\nI wouldn't say it's a fluke, but it certainly is rare!\n\n🫣"

    "all_comment_text": "What an awesome harvest! That space looks wonderful, great job! Way to make the most out of the area you have!\n\nThanks so much. It's our happy place. :)\n\nIt looks like paradise\n\nTo us it really is.  :) thank you.\n\nMy god you guys should have a roadside stand! Everything looks beautiful. I’m so jealous. Nice work!\n\nWe've thought about it. Thanks!\n\nWOW…you folks are eating the best of the best!\n\nWe do. We grow almost all of our yearly produce and eat seasonally.\n\nI’m so envious! It taste better when you grow it yourself doesn’t it?\n\nYes. There really is no contest between store as homegrown. Its also cheaper once you get a real grip on it. Ww know that there will be times we have to supplement in more but we try to look ahead and since its something we love anyway. It makes the work.work.. less worky.\n\nIn my opinion this is why people don’t like tomatoes. You can’t beat a fresh homegrown tomato. The ones from the stores have no taste comparatively speaking\n\nThe store ones taste like plastic snd depression. My garden snobbery refuses to call them real tomatoes. Several peer reviewed studies have shown that produced sold at stores have less nutrients.  Which is horrible and leads to Hidden hunger, or micronutrient deficiencies. My body doesn't metabolize like it should so I strive to eat as healthy as possible. What's sold in stores is damn near criminal.\n\nI agree wholeheartedly. To me store bought vegetables have to be covered with things to make them taste better which isn’t good for the body.\n\nTruth!\n\nGrass is boring!! Your yard looks amazing!!!\n\nGrass is super boring!! Thanks!\n\nWhat a mighty harvest! Your crops are wonderful, what do you use to feed your plants?\n\nAny tips you have learnt that you can share with us please?\n\nI love that you nurtured a garden space with your kids and watched it grow and develop with them. It's a beautiful gift to pass on to them. They seem to be loving it too. I'm sure it must bring you a lot of joy to see them take it on themselves now.\n\nYou have a beautiful garden and family. Here's to many more years of bounty &amp; happiness 🍀\n\nI think the biggest lesson I learned is to never let organic material leave your yard. That's nutrients back. We do vermiculture (worm composting) in old food grade barrels that someone was throwing out. The worms eat plant based kitchen waste, junk mail and various cuttings and guve us back castings. We don't have a compost pile but we do what we call chop-drop-cover. We pull plants that are done, lay them out in the paths between the main garden spaces,  cover them with free wood chips and let that age over the nest season. When a bed needs topping off we can then move aside the top layers of cover and fill back with the compost that was created below its renewed every year. We invested in several types of fungi and added that to the cops so we get flushes of edible mushrooms and the fungus breaks down the woodchips and such. Wneegy in energy out. \nThanks! The twins decided that they just didn't want to be.. whatever the hell the worlds bullshit wanted them to be so have opted to be happy, content garden feral creatures lol. \nHad they not wanted to garden I would have understood but they took to it tough and have turned the yard into our little sanctuary. The younger of the two turned it I to their field of study.\n\nHow absolutely wonderful!\n\nHonestly i was getting Shire vibes already, your garden is a little oasis amongst the madness in the world right now, i aspire for the same. Using the walkways to bury the old greenery is pretty genius, i saw it once on Hugh's youtube channel. Charles Dowding shared some great videos on vermiculture and no dig gardening too if you're interested in checking them out. \nSeems like you're way ahead already. \n\nPrefer that to wasting a portion of the garden to compost bins, attracting pests too. I've been trying to learn of better ways to do the same. Thank you for sharing with us all. Do you have issues with weeds or does the burying with wood chips help suppress them and kill the seeds off? Or are they better in with the worms?\n\nThe hardest part of getting started was the \"natuve\" soil. When houses are built ans were built. The good top soil is hauled off and sold and it's backfield with garbage and topped with turf. So... when rhw twins were sixteen we started tilling out and sifting the yard soil down at least a foot, then we softed it and filled it back I. With a layer of woodchips (chip drop) house decomposing material like mail and boxes and kitchen scraps.  Once the dirt lasagna was made we cover it with a tarp, and gardened in bags on top. (247garden). It was an investment to start and ww upcyxled a lot lot of things that were set out on bulk trash days lol... but once all rhe weed seeds and that evil bermuda spider grass was killed, we moved thee bags laid down rhe first autumn's worth of seasonal stuff down and then chipdropped a solid foot. Then grew up top. The woodchios over time break down in the lower layers and can be used as compost, then backfilled with  more lasagna layers. \nWe've sorry of hopscotched across the yard since. We grow a bunch in rhe bags we invested in because those suckered are tough. But they always are partially buried in rhe substrate below and  that helps with temperature and fluid retention. We layer the pathways ever year and let those be passive compost generators. Every few years all the bags have to be lifted a bit so they don't get buried but we always have great compost fill for new bags and beds. We've gotten our more expensive things second hand at swaps and freecycles. Our worms were a famous investment. So was the seeding mycelium to get the woodship breakdown cycle going, buying eggs and such for native predatory garden insects and making sure native polinators are catered too. We have our garden jar where we put our pennies or spare dollars to save for upgrades that cost and we investment always give back. \nThe processes of breakdown and growth are fascinating and I'm endlessly reading and learning because of it. We diverted our rainwater so it goes I to the yard better and those deep layers of compost soak it up like a sponge. \nWe've created on the cheap diy irrigation systems that have helped so much to keep water bills down along with the rainscaping. \nYeek.. im babbling. \nSorry!\nI love those guys! YouTube is such an amazing sharing resource!!\n\nOh no need to apologise at all! That was delightful to read and reflect. I asked and it's really refreshing to hear thorough answers, talk away.. This is absolutely the place for where it's appreciated.\n\nThat's years of experience, you've given me a lot of food for thought. I have an old garden that's been neglected for years and years that i want to bring back to life and use well. I just lack the energy now to dig and till. But laying cover on the ground and growing in bags above sounds like a great idea. I've been considering different options and the no dig is definitely appealing. I was considering composting all the weeds but i think covering would be best.\n\nHauling heavy things now is difficult for me and I'm alone so I'm thinking of ways to make it easier.\n\nI appreciate reading all you had to say, there's so much more wisdom gained over years of working your land that is priceless. Your harvests clearly show you know what you're doing.\n\nHow do you avoid pests? Do you use anything on your veg/fruit to prevent them? Or do you focus more on the soil and fertiliser. I'm guessing the wormery provides most of that?\n\nThe worms are so voracious in the summer that it gives us an extra excuse and incentive to trim and prune we started out with a little vermiculture bin the size of a large tote. The next season we split those and started two 50 galling food grade barrels someone was throwing out. (They were moving I to an elderly community so we purchased or adopted their garden stuff) now we have four of them cranking out castings. We move the upper layers of feeding worms and then sift out the castings. Then start feeding them again. They don't slow down u til autumn and temp drops. The tops are heavy wire open grids that lock down. Rhe rain filters through the castings and drain out through hoses at rhe bottom. We put this worm tea into jugs that we got from the local ikea. Rhey are uaed to bring in cooking oil so we use rhem for worm tea and passive hydroponics. \nWe watch for rodent activity and deal qith rhem qith traps and other nature. \nWe have a fox that visits eveey evening. Has for years. Ahe shows up on rhe garden cameras ans qhwn we see hee chase down and kill a rodent... the ghost of chickens past make an egg materialize in the garden in a bowl. Zhe doesn't always get a rodent, but we make sure wveey three ro five nights rhat an egg shows up. We never wait for her, we don't want her human friendly. But she has a knack and gets not only a rodent but and egg. She also marks all around rhe garden and when she pees on the water dish near where rhe invisible chicken leaves the eggs we pour rhe water in a sprayer and mark all over the yard. \nThis helps keep rhe feral cats out and the birds safe.\nCarolina reapers and other super hits are way to much for me I stop at a scotch bonnet or so... but I grow some mega hits for a friend and IL break down some, put the seeds and membrans in a bottle of eater and shake. Then I spray thugs I don't want rodents and squirrels and such to get into. Birds usialy want the fluid in garden veggies more than the meat so we have lots of passive water dishes all through the gardens. Usually shallow saucers and such we gut at savers. They get filled when we water but are too small to really pose a mosquito problem the birds enjoy the water and then clean bad bugs off my plants. We use good bugs to hunt bad bugs and if we have to spray. Usualy a soapy water is enough to deal with things. \nLike fennel. Where I live, fennel is pereenial. I just let it seed and regrow from the base, yanking off what I want when I need it, but, in the spring when it first comes up the aphids hit it hard. But that brings in the lady bugs who lay eggs and ladvea devour rhe aphids, once the fennel is clean they fly all over the yard looking for more nasties. Same with lacewings. When the fennel is clear, I can start harvesting side shoots and bulbs. When they go to seed I rub those seeds between my palms and rhey smell so good. I get fennel seed, dried leaf, fennel pollen and then I just throw rhe seeds back amongst the flowers and let rhem sprout. \nWe get racoons that come through, ans opossums but the pepper spray keeps rhem out of rhe food.. they do however also cheese off any feral cats rhey encounteso... its a win win..\nWe mix our cooking oils with cheap oatmeal and rhat and meat scraps are left in rhe awrly morning in a  irdbath that acts as an offering space. We go out, make our daily morning noises to tell the local crows that breakfast is served and they clean the scrapes up and they don't rip up the garden and less end up in land fills. We've made these relationships over the years. They aren't pets, were just other animals in the space they enjoy lol.\n\nYou and your family are so cool. I'm saving one of your comments so I can come back to it, you are so generous with your information!! Thank you for sharing!\n\nYou're welcome and thank you! We should always help each other. Community is important\n\nThis is absolute gold thank you for sharing. Your garden will be a good example for others if you are willing to share!! You are doing things I've read as best practices so its awesome to see it working well. Cycling nutrients and inputs/outputs is the whole game!!\n\nOh we love to share. When we're out in rhe garden people stop and ask questions. We're glad to help. :)\n\nI love your alternate composting method, \"chop,drop,cover!\" I couldn't have a garden this year, but I'm going to try next year. It was just too hot and dry, and my county restricted water use quite severely, and my water bills were way too high anyway. I'm gonna try to drip system instead, if I can manage it. \n \n For your vermiculture worms, how much junk mail can they handle, and is there any texture or type of paper that they cannot eat? (like plain printer paper vs card stock postcard ads?) \n \n Thanks for sharing your wonderful garden with us, along with your tips and practices!!\n\nThe worms don't seem to care about paper type. We start out slow in the spring when they are waking up. And increase as the stuff vanishes over the course of rhe summer. I've never measured it but we like to guve a balanced mix of wet fresh scraps and dry material. Once autom sets in I like to throw in a bunch of leaves. As if they fell to the ground to insulate the too of the colony. Worms are super fascinating! The tiny animals I the garden are endlessly fascinating. Like the patent leather beetles. They are decomposed that break down woody material. They are so industrious and when I looked them up I found out they have their own language! Nature simply awesome me. \nBut setting up worm composting really helped I feel. We add a handful of castings to the hole when we plant. The layers of crop and drop and woodchips really help retain water. The semi broken down material that isn't decomposed enough to be compost yet makes fabulous mulch and then finishes its breakdown as the plants grow.  Chip drop is a game.changer but you have to have a place.for them to dump the chips. You get a mountain. When  we get a load we put out a sign and invite neighbors to come cart some off. Since it's free, we figure we may as well help out. The local tree people simply check I. When they are near to see if the pile needs a top off.\n\nOh wow! Thank you so much for all the info! And I agree that worms and other such decomposers are truly fascinating!\n\nWelcome! I'm always reminded that I'm a visitor to the garden. That it's home to so much. We.respwct that and strive to find ways that we can help nature help us while we help it. We're all kn this lovely little.planet together. Happy gardening!\n\nYou're all precisely what this world needs more of.\n\nThank you for being such wonderful Guardians and sharing your wisdom with us\n\nI chop and dropped broccoli last year and a bunch of new broccoli started growing from the massive stalks. Unexpected surprise.\n\nBeautiful garden and family! Congrats 🎊\n\nThanks!\n\nAre those scotch bonnet peppers? Very gorgeous garden and what a great yield!\n\nYes! Some of them are. We grow a range between no heat to pretty spicy, i like some zip!  I'll be honest, I don't like the super hots like reapers, a bit too much for me but I grow a super hot or two each year for a few folks that can't themselves but love the extra spicy.  I make sure my minds, hits and super hots are far enough away with plants in between rhem to keep surprises too a minimum, but my peppers are open pollinated snd while I make sure to self polinate some to keep some of the original types to grow ans save in our seed library. I sorr of love doing a pollination lottery where we save most of the seeds of a plant are saved knowing rhey were pollinated by any of rhe others around it. I've gotten some fun ans weird things lol. I am plating with crossing a few and tracking the progress. I love all the stuff the garden has taught me. \nThanks!\n\nWhat is the name if the curly snake gourd?\n\nIt's called \"Python\" it's fun! It has a good flavor too. They can be a but tough but cut into matchsticks they make a lovely side or part of a main. \nThanks!\n\nThank you. Your garden inspires me\n\nThank you! Seeds are tiny little packes of hope and amazing things lol.\n\nLove pic 8! 😆😆😆 I love this so much. You should post on the no more lawns sub. Soon you can have your own booth at the local farmer's Market! Those veggies are gorgeous. \n\nMy horrible neighbor would totally call the city to complain about your \"messy back yard full of weeds\" (ask me how I know) 🤬\n\nWhen my twins were still young and the neighborhood was less diverse and more \"everyone better conform!\" Every year I would have the county called for \"ruining\" my lawn and all the usual crap. Thankfully the neighborhood has had more toung people my twins ages move in and are more culturally diverse. So we have less of that nonsense and more community building. We absolutely love when someone new ventures into the yard with a notepad and questions. They always leave with an envelope full of starter seeds and some samples of whatever is growing lol. \nThe twins and I aren't big social creatures but we adore getting people hooked on gardening.\n:)\n\nI'm envious. I caught my neighbor throwing rotten food and trash into my yard more than once, and a couple weeks ago caught her in the act of digging up the soil in front of my fence, trying to get it to fall over! She works for my city's \"Keep X Beautiful\" office, too! 🤪 She is angry because I am converting my yard to all native plants! I wish you and the twins and other like-minded people lived by me. 😞\n\nI'll never understand cookie cutter people that want to suck the joy out of others. See if you can contact your local parks and recs. Sometimes they nature folks can guide you to ways you can protect your natives ;) \nGood luck! We love our native species!\n\nAdopt me!\n\nI would so adopt so many people lol. Thanks!!!\n\nThat is so amazing.\n\nThank you!\n\n[deleted]\n\nThank you!\n\nStole this meme off of someone\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uofb01tdmb7e1.jpeg?width=1170&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fad7a8eb6ab1b98a9bf42f3ed4ebe101386cf4c0\n\nAwww lol. Thanks.\n\nI just wanted to say that your smiles and energy bring me joy. I can feel the lightness and happiness all the way through my little phone screen.\n\nThank you so so much. I'm glad our little space makes folks smile.\n\nSuch a beautiful family! I love that gardening is a family affair.\n\nWe step into the yard after we've all worked and wham... the garden is there. Each season is special and we've simply decided that once we're home rhe world can go away lol.\nThanks. :)\n\nNiceee!\n\nThanks!\n\nThese photos are so fucking beautiful. The faces and the fruits. It was like looking at a national geographic article on homesteading.\n\nThank you!\n\nYarden!\n\nI want a Yarden!\n\nI hope you both get a wonderful yarden soon!!!\n\nOh wow congratulations it look so beautiful all the vegetables you have here I n LA I have tomatoes that about it I’m jealous any hits you can give me\n\nNever let organic matter leave your yard. We path layer our trimming and autumn break downs and woodchip over them and let ut passively compost in layers. We also do vermiculture, woem composting usi g our kitchen scraps and some yard waste and lots of junk mail.\nBe safe!\n\nYou all are my heroes.  Looks great!!!\n\nNajssss\n\nThanks!\n\ngorgeous garden\n\nLove the varieties you’re growing .\n\nThanks! It's so fun to try new things.\n\nHoly wow, your garden is stellar!!! I'm totally jealous! ❤️👩‍🌾👊\n\nThanks so much!\n\nWhat is the veggie in photo 11? It’s so cool and snakey! Your garden is an example of what I aspire to create\n\nThank you! It's a snake gourd. They are sometimes called python beans. They are delicious!\n\nWoah woah where’s the nsfw tag?! \nJk your harvest was absolutely beautiful! You did great 🩷\n\nLol! I know, right some of those gourds are hilarious lol. Thanks!\n\nWhat’s the big curly one? That’s crazy!!\n\nWhat're you using for squash trellises? They look so nice up like that\n\nCattle panels! We scored some at an estae sale a few years back. But we will use whatever we can. A little elderly lady came by last spring with two dozen wire tripods that had held wreaths at her husband's funeral. She didn't want to see them end up thrown away ans wasted so we gave her a basket of beans and now they help support bush beans and such lol.\n\nGood ol cattle panels. \n\nThat's a sweet story for your neighbor. Always amazing when you can give back\n\nSometimes we'll go out and someone will have dropped off attack of flower pots from big box stores knowing well use them. We get so many that when we germinate seeds (we save seeds so have sooooooo many) we over sow and then split and replant and each spring we give bunches of babies away. The little pots usualy brought back and  we use them till they fall apart. \nSo many young people are starting lives here since the older folks have moved on. I abaolutly love being able to gift them with things for their first gardens. It doesn't cost us anything really to start the extra plants, and why let seeds go to waste? (We save  fricken thousands lol.....) So we stock seed libraries and give packs to teachers and the local community gardens.\n\nAwesome! I'm surprised you find the time to collect the seeds, it's a whole side gig!\n\nWe have to cut things up anyway.  You know those mesh laundry hanging storage things. They have like three sections. We harvest, rinse (or ferment and rinse, depending the seed) and let rhem dry on squares of old cloth from  old sheets We get at yard sales that have holes and such. Once dry we label and put in envelopes.  I'll sit on my breaks and fold little seed library envelopes and tuck species information we printed out and cut up. It's passive side work for days rhat are too chilly or rainy or it's dark or such. \nWe do some crazy garden shit in our free time lol.\n\nBeautiful garden, so rich and healthy. Where in the world is this?\n\nEastern zone 7!!! ThanksA\n\nYou must be so proud!\n\nI truly am. I love  it so much. Thank you.\n\nWhat are the small peppers in images 15/16?\n\nThose are called biquinho peppers. They come in yellow orange and red and are nearly heatless. They have just a little kick to them. I they make great while you work garden snacks and in pickles and on salads and sautéed. The plants are about three ro four feet tall and a nice canopy. They are super prolific.\n\nI'm almost 50, but will you adopt me? I'll help, and you look like such a fun family (and I'll bring my twins too!).\n\nWhat is the giant gouard looking thing in Figure 2?\n\nThe long slender ones with the know on the end are called rampicante, they are also known as tromboni squash.  The vines are long and strong. They trellis easy. When the fruits are green and tender they can be eaten like any summer squash like zucchini. Skin and all. I'd you let them mature they get tan and the skin gets tough and they can store like butternut squash. The one where she has the huge green one over her shoulder is a Bhim gourd. It's also very delicious.\n\nnice Gyarden!\n\nYou all are so cute 🥰\n\n* \"The glory of gardening: hands in the dirt, head in the sun, heart with nature. To nurture a garden is to feed not just the body, but the soul.\" —Alfred Austin\n\nBeautiful yarden!\n\nAre those little peppers binquino? I had some for the first time at Thanksgiving. They were pickled and delicious. Tasted like they were going to unleash a firestorm on my mouth but then there was absolutely zero heat. Quite an experience!\n\nWow, great garden. I too grew Biquinho's this year. [https://imgur.com/a/3wfv7jt](https://imgur.com/a/3wfv7jt)\n\nPinetree Seeds [https://www.superseeds.com/collections/peppers/products/biquinho-yellow-55-days](https://www.superseeds.com/collections/peppers/products/biquinho-yellow-55-days)\n\nBeautiful! Nice harvest!\n\nOmg I love this!!!!\n\nBeautiful!!\n\ni love all of these precious photos :D i hope to have my yard be all garden like this one day. where do yall live?\n\nThis is flipping awesome. Well done, ladies! What zone do y’all live in? Curious about the weather and dirt quality. We have to do all raised beds since it’s all rock here in 8a.central Texas.\n\nYou all seem like the coolest people 💚 Wish we were neighbors!! May your labors of love continue to provide you ample joy and vegetables 🥲\n\nDon’t you mean your…. *yarden*\n\nI am beyond jealous!!\n\nYard-en\n\nPeppers look great\n\nYou’re living my dream 😭\n\nYarden\n\nHoly sheeet I have that Dundalk, MD Golden Domes shirt and I wear it all the time! If ya know, ya know!\n\nIn the first picture, those little round chilis? We call them \"chiltepines\" here in northwest Mexico.\n\nWow!! Very cool.  What's that vegetable on the 11th pic?  The skinny one that looks like a rope growing into knots.  Never seen it before.\n\nIt's called a snake gourd.  It's also called a python bean bit It's not a bean. Germination can be challenging with them but once they get going they are fun to grow and great in stir fries.\n\nIncredible work. If I may ask, how do you guys avoid disease/unwanted pests? If I had vegetation that dense, it would be a nightmare of powdery mildew and septoria.\n\nThat is awesome! Wow! You guys are nailin' the garden game!!\n\nBaby steps over the years have paid off. It has grown with my twins that's for sure. :)\n\nWhat are the little guys in picture 15? Is that a pepper?\n\nThose are called biquinho peppers! They are a nearly heatless little sweety. Just a litrle tiny kiss of heat. They come in yellow, orange and red and are really yummy. I like popping them straight off rhe bush as a garden work snack, they get thrown into salads, they make a lovely side oe in a side cooked or raw. We made twenty quarts jars of pickled biquinhos, onion and garlic that are sitting on the shelf waiting to be enjoyed. \nThe plants get about three or four feet tall and are super productive. They'll always have a place in my garden. So much so that of the pepper plants we over winter we have three of them that are.replanted each year. \nThanks!\n\nThis is SO BEAUTIFUL!! I love all these pictures\n\nWhat an amazing garden! That’s beautiful!!!!\n\nI'm so jealous! Amazing job guys!\n\nBless you all!!!!!\n\nSo inspiring!!\n\nNow that’s extremely impressive\n\nWowww! Beautiful garden!\n\nThat’s no garden, that’s a FARM! Magnificent!\n\nEverything is Soo huge and healthy!! Y'all have a gift!\n\nThanks nature is amazing and honestly when I grow up I want to be just like my kids. :) \nI have a little plaque in the yard that says \"nature never did betray the heart that loved her\" and we love her so much lol. \nIt's our inner woodland garden hag energy lol.\n\nNice job! Y’all are pros\n\nSerious goals. This is beautiful!! I want to munch on those veggies\n\nThanks!\nYou can do it! One step at a time! \nYou can track me by the crunchy sounds lol. I'm like a fat sassy cow out there grazing lol.\n\nAwesome!!!\n\nYour gardens are AMAZING! Everything looks so healthy &amp; happy\n\nThank you for sharing.  It is wonderful to see a harvest.  It’s been freezing here in NJ\n\nJelly, nice garden nicer looking young ladies. Stay blessed.\n\nThis is the way.\n\nWow! Very impressive.\n\nAmazing work!!!\n\nWow!\n\nWe’re can I get the bonnet peppers plant or seeds\n\nWow! Awesome! Where did you get the seeds for the snake gourd? I was looking for it and couldn't find the long one ! Please let me know.\n\nBaker creek had those but.... rhey don't have rhe best germination rate. I usualy only buy from BC if I abaolutly can't find it anywhere else.\nBut... if you soak them overnight I warm water and trim rhe edges of the seed, then plant them you should get a few. This was our first year for them. Seeds of India have two other snake gourd species, both pretty prolific and also tasty, if nit as long and wiggly.  The cultivars are \"viper\" and \"naga\".\n\nI have been rendered speechless! This is the dream! \nThe produce is so amazing! This is kinda our goal at home too. Grow enough to self sustain. We get half the way there but still need to pick up a few things from the market. \nI love the peppers the most, among all your produce 😄\n\nWhat are those colorful beans in slide 6? Your garden is amazing!\n\nThose are romano beans! We grow green, yellow and purple ones. They are so tender and delicious I don't bother to grow regular green beans anymore. Even when rhey get larger they stay tender, and ttey were super prolific.\n\nOh wow\n\nPicture 8... I'm dying 😂😂😂\n\n[deleted]\n\nThis is inspiring\n\nAll of your photos just made me so happy! Beautiful!!\n\nWhat an awesome looking harvest, and I love the variety of what you guys grew! Looks like you three have a great time doing it too, don't lose that!\n\nThis is such a dream. You created a home where your kids wanted to stay and express themselves.\n\nThank you for sharing your wealth of knowledge.  That is an incredible yard and garden.  I saved this post to come back and read again.\n\nWhat are the teardrop tomoatos called and what is their flavor profile?\n\nlegendary! i wish your family plentiful health and wealth\n\nWow!  How did you get your plants to grow so big?\n\nI belive its rhe soil. We compost. Thanks!\n\n❤️\n\nCmon name some of the unique ones.. i want to knoww .. this issssss sooo amazinggg harvesttttttt\n\nThis is such a beautiful transformation! The garden looks so lush and full of life. Growing your own food together must feel so rewarding..love how you’ve turned the space into something so vibrant!\n\nWow! Look at all that food! And your family is adorable. Thanks for sharing them with us.\n\nVery impressive\n\nIMPRESSIVE\n\nSuch a pristine garden. I love it!\n\nEveryone looks like they are really having fun too!\n\nWe truly enjoy it. We all have things we focus on, ideas and things we want to build or improve. It's a team effort. Winter is apw t planning out lol. It's almost thw winter solstice which is our official date to start planting seeds for spring. Onions are started first lol.\n\nHow do you avoid the squash borers?\n\nI'm going to go out on a limb and say that you don't live in the northern part of the country? 😄\n\n... So it's your yarden?\n\nWow, I’m beyond impressed\n\nCutest smiles I’ve seen all day!\n\nY'all make the greatest faces in your photos 🤣 thanks for sharing looks amazing!\n\nGreat job!\n\nIs that a Chinese Snake Bean and also a Tromboncino squash?\n\nI’m sorry your lawn died.\n\nthose squash plants are YUGE!\n\nI’m green with envy. This is beautiful 😍\n\nLovely harvest\n\nDope gourds, any tips on gourds?  I have some seeds and was going to plant some this spring\n\nAwesome!!\n\nWhat a harvest!! 👏\n\n11th picture. What is that??? And I LOVE her shirt! 🤣\n\nBeautiful can I come over?\n\nY’all are amazing!! That’s a beautiful garden\n\nDo you ever have any type of problems with bugs?, you have so much plants, i feel like it would be hard to manage that many and not have at least one\n\nIf you don't' mind me asking, what do you use for fertilizer?\n\nLove this idea!\n\nFanbloodytastic 😀\n\nWow heaven\n\nI'm so jealous! We used to live where I could grow a nice garden. We even had chickens for a while! It's so great to eat the fruits of your labor, literally! So beautiful!\n\nWhat happens in the winter? Do they die off and grow back?\n\nwow amazing harvest\n\nHas anyone else asked what you grow? Interested in seeing a list of what you are able to harvest!  Great job, beautiful garden.\n\nI'm so envious of your paradise, I bet it smells amazing there.\n\nSimply beautiful!!!\n\nWow that’s beautiful 🤩\n\nAbundance!!! 🥰✨🥹\n\nBeautiful. Wow!"

I’m jealous! Your hard work paid off!  So great to have an established foundation to add your own finishing touches to\n\nIt’s like real life home scapes or something.\n\nSaw the first couple of photos and thought “oh, that’s so nice, can’t be Australia” then saw the little blue tongue and was proven wrong! Congrats on the beautiful garden, it brings my heart joy to know it’s getting the care it deserves in our beautiful corner of the world :)\n\nIt is a deceptively english garden however I'm happy to say the original owners didn't completely neglect natives. We have some established bottlebrush, tea tree and kurajongs and I add 42 other natives on arrival.\n\nThat pink magnolia is to die for!!!! My dream is to one day have a property with 4-6 of them.\n\nWhat a joy this is! I envy you having this to care for.\n\nHey, that looks so nice. Definitely alot of work. Looks peaceful. 🥰\n\nit’s giving me secret garden vibes.\n\nThis is beautiful.\n\nThat is on its way to a lot of potential to be a monet paradise\n\nI love that flowering bush , is it a camellia?\n\nYes\n\nThose roses! 😍😍😍😍\n\nOr are they camellias? Look at the leaves\n\nOh shit. I think you’re right.\n\nIt's cool. I thought they were roses, too, until I looked closer. They ARE spectacular, aren't they?\n\nI had to zoom in to get it right! 🤣\n\nThat is the fattest wild lizard I've ever seen. I would say \"good catch\" on that pic, but I dare say this fatty is incapable of escaping much of anything.\n\nIn her defence she was incredibly pregnant at the time this picture was taken.\n\nHow does it feel to be living my dream\n\nPretty nice. If it makes you feel any better I was in a cbd one bed apartment for 4 years before this and a vacant warehouse for 3 years. This is a HUGE upgrade for me\n\nYour style of photography perfectly encompasses that country aesthetic.\n\nThat little skink scared the bejeezus out of me lmao. Warn a girl next time 😂 absolutely beautiful property though. You should be so proud of yourself.\n\nHaha she's friendly I promise\n\nYou've done some great work!  I hope you feel some pride in your accomplishment.\n\nwoah 😳 new country home goal unlocked 🔓 🌳🌳🌳🏡 🌳🌳🌳\n\nYour hard work paid off. Looks beautiful.\n\nLovely!\n\nWell, this is positively gorgeous. Good for you!\n\nBeautiful.  What type of tree is in the first picture?\n\nKeen to know, myself-  looks like a Saucer/Japanese Magnolia.\n\nSaucer magnolia. \nThere are a bunch of pink magnolias that are so gorgeous!\n\nAlso known as a Tulip Magnolia, because of its flower shape. All shades of pink, purple, and white!  A favorite 😍 in early spring!\n\nThank you\n\nlooks like a paradise!\n\nGorgeous, nice work. Now you are the caretaker!\n\nWow! Your hard work paid off - fantastic pictures. Now you get to enjoy this property the way it was probably first set up to enjoy. But now, all the plants and trees are really mature. So beautiful - thanks for sharing.\n\nAhhh you created a fairy tale garden!!! 💜💜💜\n\nAbsolutely gorgeous 😍\n\n😍 beautiful! Living the dream!\n\nBeautiful! And a lot of work.\n\nThis place looks enchanted. Thank you for sharing with us, and kudos on the beautiful results of your hard work!\n\nI don’t know what state you are in, that is a beautiful property. All your work adds up to an amazing experience for you and visitors.\n\nAustralia, thank you.\n\nThis is insanely beautiful! I’m very jealous! I can imagine how much hard work you put into this! Great job! I hope can now sit down and enjoy it\n\nIt was a lot of work but it was the sort of work I enjoy so not as bad as most. The challenge for me is going to do anything else, the garden always has a need of more tasks!\n\nWhoa it looks so magical, what a well rewarded effort!\n\nAnd it came with SKINKS!! 🤩 What a bonus!\n\nI cried with happiness a few times when I first saw them. I grew up with blue tongues and missed them dearly.\n\nThis is the life I want 🥹\n\nthats a cute lizard :D a friend\n\nI’m sat here getting misty eyed thinking about the person/people who planted those trees and shrubs and made those walkways years ago… and how happy they’d be to know you restored the yard instead of some developer just bulldozing it all to the ground. What a beautiful gift from the past!!\n\nThank you, I feel the same. I've learned that they, like us, moved to this very quiet part of the world because they thought it was the most beautiful. I love that even though we never met I feel like we shared a common goal.\n\nBeautiful...this is the hobby of a lifetime, congratulations\n\nThis looks DREAMY!! Well done!\n\nBeautiful property. Nice to find those gardening diamonds in the rough. Really nice work bring it back.  Someone obviously spent a lot of time and energy putting it in\n\nYes clearly a mountain of work was done to establish this many years ago and then a few owners in between weren't up to the work of it. It's nice to polish it off again\n\nIsn’t that satisfying\n\nThat’s like the game Gardenscapes in real life.\n\nYou bought a painting that came to life\n\nWow beautiful\n\nOhhhhh myyyy. The vicarious satisfaction I feel from looking at this. 😍 A marvelous steward of nature.\n\nBeautiful scenery and everything you've uncovered is simply wonderful to look at. Beautiful flowing trees and flowers and don't forget the mountains in the background and of course the path ways you've found are gorgeous.\n\nThank you :)\n\nThat garden is a magical place!  I feel my stress level dropping just looking at it!\n\nIt has that affect on my every day, a wonderful way to purge stress\n\nThe Secret Garden!!\n\nWow! Where are you?! The colour of the earth says somewhere hot!\n\nWell picked, Australia\n\nVery very nice\n\nLovely garden and grounds, but how is the home? Is it in good shape? Or does it matter?\n\nHaha it's in good enough shape. She's a little rough but ultimately well built and by the time I finish the repairs to things like gutters that are completely rotted out, she'll be right.\n\nAbsolutely glorious! Some people have all the luck.\n\nThis was definitely luck, we'd been looking and waiting for years and didn't have the budget or the right properties. Then this old place came up as a deceased estate right as we were able to get a loan.\n\nIt was meant to be then! I’m so glad it went to someone who will appreciate it properly. And not someone who just wants to tear it out and put in a lawn.\n\nI've heard the same sentiment from many neighbours. They were sad the garden wasn't being improved and love and they're all so relieved to see me out there every day :)\n\nAww someone obviously put so much love into building this little slice of heaven years ago. Bless you for restoring it, I'm sure they're smiling down on you from wherever they are.\n\nMy grandmother had a famous garden at her house years ago, but it's a several hour drive away from where my entire family now lives. After she died, the house was sold (none of our family could afford or put the effort into a house in the country hours away from us). My sister and I took a road trip out there last year and whoever owns the house now has completely neglected the house and the garden. You could still see some lilies and rhododendrons and overgrown rosebushes along the pathways but the entire place is in disrepair. Absolutely heartbreaking. I hope someone like you buys the property and restores her beautiful garden someday ❤️\n\nI'm sorry to hear that, wouldn't it be great if houses with great gardens were sold with some sort of caretaking clause.\n\nSo true! But I love the idea that someone like you buys it years later and sees the potential and works with what you've been gifted. I hope to buy a space of my own like this and nourish and love and bring it back to life someday, the same as I hope the owners of my grandmother's land will do someday. Best of luck, fellow gardener!\n\nSo true, if all gardens were well kept there would be no treasures to uncover. What great perspective\n\nAww this makes me so happy! The Secret Garden was one of my favourite books as a child, I never thought it would ever translate into real life for me. This exchange has given me hope for my grandmother's garden. Thank you so much 💕\n\nFantastic.\n\nThis is one of my \"If I were a rich man\" dreams: get a beautiful old property and restore the paths and gardens.  I'd have dogs joyfully hanging out with me all day as I worked on it.  I'd hire someone else to restore the house though since I suck at that kind of stuff.\n\nI love it, and so satisfying. I did garden landscaping one summer and we were working on this one overgrown place and we finally uncovered a pathway that was buried by overgrowth and it felt so gooddd\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kfs0z367g1od1.jpeg?width=4000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=66b29803c9f1aec5cc4ab550405d9ff844bfea38\n\nThis was one part\n\nI love Magnolia trees!  They’re so beautiful!\n\nIf you're a fan of history, when I first saw these pics my jaw dropped and I thought \"Main Body!\"\n\nThat was what the recon plane first sent when he discovered the Japanese aircraft carriers at the battle of Midway. He was so blown away that he forgot the actual message he was supposed to send (type of craft, strength, and info about it). \n\nThis is overwhelming. Congratulations. Need a Gardener?\n\nwhat a fantastic story, I will remember that one. perhaps I will make a small sign that says main body.\n\nWoooow! Such beautiful work, bravo! 🌸🌱 Do you have any photos of the before? 👀\n\nAbsolutely gorgeous!! You've worked hard, enjoy!!\n\nThat ROSEBUSH!!! 😍\n\nAmazing oasis for you!!!! What’s that lizard/crocodile?\n\nit's a blue tongue, they are great little lizards and keep my snail and slug numbers under control\n\nWait. Is that a Gator?\n\nlovely job\n\nSo magical ✨️\n\nAbsolutely Breathtaking ❤️❤️\n\nThought this must be Eden until I saw that fat little bratwurst of a skink - but Australia is a nice runner up 😊\n\nHehehe excellent eye. We are now naming one of the lizards Bratwurst because we like that nickname so much.\n\nThat’s adorable! We’re in the States but we have a fat little man of our own, his name is Corn on the Cob :)\n\nOh yes, great name, you have a gift\n\nWow!!!!\n\nLook at you, living in The Secret Garden\n\nHow beautiful and lucky!\n\nIs that a blue tongue skink??? Are you in Australia???\n\nWonderful! I am so happy for you! What a beautiful place to tend to and beautify!\n\nYou’re so lucky! Gorgeous\n\nLooks awesome. I'm about to do this at my own 99 year old new home and I can't wait!\n\nWow that’s awesome! I would be so happy to know the Japanese’s maple we planted here at our first home continued to receive love in another 100 years!\n\nGorgeous 😍\n\nDo you want help?! This looks like such a joy to work on!\n\nHah i'm probably a bit far for that. We are in Aus.\n\nSo I’m swiping through the OP’s pictures and I’m like:  \nnice…  \nnice…  \nnice…  \nWTF.  \n*pause* \nAnd then back to: nice…\n\nhaha no she's a lovely old lizard.\n\nHow much for a tour? Your garden reminds me of the Lewis Ginter Botanical Garden down in VA :)\n\nWell the plane ticket would be the first hurdle, we are in Australia\n\nBeautiful place.\n\n[deleted]\n\nBetter than harmless, they are great characters and keep my snail numbers down. we have ten on the property (possibly more) they grow up to 40cm long and just nap in the sunshine all day. I grew up catch and releasing these guys.\n\nLovely!\n\nA true treasure hunt.\n\nWhat kind of tree is the third slide? So amazing\n\nCamellia\n\nThis is like a little paradise! And those mountain views! What a gem.\n\nThose mountain views are what we came for, this little town is surrounded by mountains and parks to explore\n\nOh wow. This is such a beautiful property and wonderful long term project. Congratulations!\n\nWhat kind of lizard is that 👀\n\nBlue tongue, very common in our gardens in aus. Friendly and fantastically fun to observe.\n\nWhat is that first tree? It’s beautiful\n\nPort Wine Magnolia\n\nIs…is that an alligator?\n\nA very tiny one... it's a blue tongue lizard.\n\nThis is fantastic! Do you have any advice? I'm trying to do something similar right now on a much smaller scale (a beautiful 50yo perennial garden that had been left to overgrow) and it feels like there'll be no end to it (although the endless weeding/pruning/etc. on it is fun, so I can't complain). I'm new to gardening\n\nI'm not sure if it's advice really but my approach was to just focus on weeding, pruning and removals for the first 3 months. I didn't plant a thing. I just cleaned house, mulched and removed anything nasty and invasive. Then I spent a few months building soil health, restoring it where it was hydrophobic, adding and building compost. Finally, now, I've just started planting. That gave me time to get to know the garden in a variety of seasons before wasting time and money planting the wrong things.\n\nMacedon?\nWould have bought it for the magnolia alone, Lovely camellia aswell.\n\nOut near Kosciusko, but it's similar\n\nWell done!\n\nWhat is that in picture 4?!\n\nI'm so jealous! It looks amazing!\n\nWhat did that snake just eat?\n\nSo beautiful\n\n😍🤘\n\nBeautiful and great work. The house was meant to go to someone who would cherish it. Enjoy ur hard work OP\n\nGreat work OP👍\n\nGorgeous\n\nDream goals\n\nNice blue tongue!\n\nAhhh it’s so beautiful 😍😍\n\nThat is one beautiful garden out there!\n\nReally Gorgeous!\n\nStunning! Great work - now enjoy!!\n\nNice work cleaning up!!!👍\n\nBeautiful gardens! Your hard work is paying off.\n\nDREAM HOUSE GOALSSSSS\n\nHow beautiful!  It's so calm I'm at a loss for words.  Good for you."

That is so cool\n\nWhat a treasure!\n\nA clock maker / repair man would be able to help.   \nThat looks like it would be worth $$$ on antique roadshow.\n\n$50-$150 sold on eBay\n\nIf they go for that cheap, thats great for those of us who want one 😍\n\nI’ve found two on eBay. One for $225 and another for $234.\n\nThose didn’t sell for that much.\n\n😢\n\nMaybe a locksmith would be able to help you \n\nThat's really cool, and it absolutely deserves to run again.\n\nI'd bring it to an antique shop that fixes watches/clocks. My guess would be the key is a standard size, and they'll either have replicas or can tell you what you'd need to order online.\n\nYou might also try posting pictures of the hole on Reddit. There are some really niche hobbyists here who'd be happy to give you advice.\n\nI've only just started perusing this subreddit, so I have to admit that seeing \"try posting pictures of the hole\" gave me a bit of pause... 😶😅\n\nMe has hecho reír...!!!🤣😅😂\n\nWhere we live, there is a guy that goes to peoples homes to fix grandfather clocks. That could always be a starting place if they couldn't fix themselves.\n\nVery cool\n\nI have a planters clock like this.  Is this clock electric? If so, the \"key\" you are missing is very basic.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w7n2s0dgsq3e1.jpeg?width=3472&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3dfd955951dd7f83f75ce8fe07eab17843f40c73\n\nFrom the manual\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nq8zcpkjsq3e1.jpeg?width=3472&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7f493220c120d387a2419f101d66efc88bd1a469\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k42am68nsq3e1.jpeg?width=4624&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f6685e3bed717c12623b7cacc66671be9f2edbac\n\nYes that's it. Just a plastic key\n\nThe tool is kept inside the clock, remove the back plate. If missing, you really don't need it. You can use anything to push the moondial\n\nThanks for the info I'll have to try that when I visit them next\n\nWhat about for setting the planting portion? I've been looking at a few for sale myself, but not many have the original key. I have zero issues using something else as a key, but if that portion does require a specific shape/key, then I have more research to do before I get one.\n\nI haven't set mine in a while, but I believe you only use the pointed end of the setting tool. The other end is to secure it in a slot for storage. If I have time I will go through the motions today to confirm\n\nThank you so much! I know it seems like a dumb question, but there's so little information online, it's really helpful having someone real to ask\n\nNo worries, totally understand.\n\nSorry for the delay. You only need the pointed end of the setting tool. A craft stick or popsicle stick cut at a slight angle will work fine. The 2 slots indicated in red are used to set the moon phase and planting schedule. Hard to describe, but you basically use the point end of the stick to engage a slot on a wheel, then rotate that wheel. For the moon, you simply slide the stick up and down, which actuates a lever.  The hook end of the\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/39zmdk2xc24e1.jpeg?width=4624&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dba5171ed118a4baf02fc034d4e9e20e4003c146\n\nsetting tool is not used for anything except storing the tool.\n\nTool in the stored position.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/60z6iwszc24e1.jpeg?width=4624&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e8d5b496587b2e8e90a3942295328ecdba722742\n\nI wonder who manufactured this.  European, America, other???\n\nGnomes, they recognize no nationality\n\nI thought they were all Swedish?\n\nCan’t be true, _David the Gnome_ was Spanish.\n\n[So that's what they do with the underpants](https://www.nighttrain.co/content/images/2021/01/underpants-gnomes.png)\n\nManufactured by Fairfield in Stamford, Connecticut, USA. Several versions sold, some branded and some not. \n\nBurpee is a US seed company and this particular model is for their centennial (1876-1976, as seen in the center where the hands are attached to the face). Other very similar ones without Burpee branding say \"Planters Clock\" rather than \"Time to Plant Burpee Seeds.\" \n\nI was able to find pictures of versions from L.L.Bean and Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, both US outdoor gear/clothing outfitters that have been around for over a century as well. (A&amp;F is mostly \"regular\" mall clothing now, but used to sell firearms and things back in the day.) An ad listed the retail price for the version from A&amp;F at $40 in 1974 or 1976. \n\n(P.S. Not AI, just very interested in this clock after seeing one in person today and then by total chance seeing this post right when I got home, before even looking it up on purpose. I am autistic lol, so this is \"normal\" for me.)\n\nThanks for your reply.  ((for some reason my reddit connection left me lonely for almost a week.}\n\nBut anyway,... I live in a town that manufactures really cool clocks.  Just wonder if you clockk from my town.\n\nSaw a similar make a few days ago for Nestle.\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/marketplace/item/865453105427725/?ref=search&amp;referral_code=null&amp;referral_story_type=post&amp;tracking=browse_serp%3A43849dad-9658-46c0-9fd0-a63d60ecd190\n\nAs I recall the Planter's Clock is American.\n\nIndeed it is. Burpee is a US seed company, and the clock comes with a US map on the back to figure out the settings for the planting times to be correct for the individual's region!\n\nI have since learned that the original Planter's Clock was manufactured by Mechtronics, a company in Fairfield Connecticut.  I'm certain that this Burpees branded example is just a variant from the same product line; it's different but only cosmetically.  This example appears to be identical to mine in layout and features.\n\nIs there any way to get a schematics of that key \nPerhaps a picture of one some how \nI’m an amateur with locks and I’d love to help get it going\n\nIt's basically just a poker, not a \"key\" key. OP should be able to make it work without it.\n\nI’ve got the Nestlé’s chocolate chip version of this.\n\nI’ve got one too.\n\nMy parents have that one!\n\nWhat season do you plant Toll House chips?\n\nWe had one on our kitchen wall 1970’s.\n\nLove this aesthetic. Anyone know what its called?\n\nPlanter's Clock\n\nI have 1. It works as well.\n\nThat’s so cool! I wish I didn’t see this because now I really want one.\n\nI have the exact same one. It was my grandfather's and he was an avid gardener. It always reminded me of him so after he passed away I asked my parents if I could have it.\n\nThat’s awesome!\n\nThat is fire\n\nEverything about this is so freaking cool\n\nDo you know if there are any stuff similar that one could buy nowadays???\n\nNot a modern version, but like with the same old aesthetics and else\n\nThis is super cool, something I would hope to\nfind at an estate sale nowadays\n\nMy grandma and her neighbor each had one of these in their cabins! Wow, memory lane\n\nThis is one of my thrifting white whales!!\n\nWow, so cool!!! 😍\n\nWow\n\nLove this\n\nAwesome\n\nI couldn’t love this more! I remember _Burbee_.\n\nVery nice\n\nThat’s really cool\n\nIt is awesome...\n\nWow, so cool!\n\nThis is awesome!!!!\n\nI love it\n\nAdorable!\n\nThat's awesome!\n\nThat is so awesome.\n\nThis is so cool!\n\nWow!!! Real stuff, that no one likes to think or make anymore\n\nThat’s sooo unreal! I wish there were more analogs like this! Hope you can find someone to help you fix that.\n\nWild I was just thinking about these clocks last night and the notion that there must be so many of us out there that spent our youth staring at this interesting clock. We always had one in my house growing up and the first time i saw my second one was at my future in-laws.\n\nI want one!! So kewl!\n\nI have one and love it!\n\nI’ve been looking for one for about a year. I have a bit of a clock collection and I’m a gardener, and a certified master gardener. This is one area where two of my interests cross and I love it. Your dad’s clock is in great shape, the ones listed online have not matched yours in condition.\n\nYes, keep this…..it’s a wonderful and a namesake for Pops.\n\ndidn't have a dream clock before, but now i do.\n\nWhat a beautiful clock!\n\nI LOVE IT.\n\nWant!\n\nThis is SO bizarre and cool to see this post right now, because I literally just in the last hour saw this same clock at a farmstand! I wanted to buy it but the owner had it out for decoration, not for sale. Just super wild to see it for the first time in person, never having known such a thing existed, and then hop on Reddit to see your post. I bet a clock repair person would be able to source a key for you!\n\nEdited to add: I found a [PDF of the setting instructions at this link](https://support.burpee.com/support/solutions/articles/60000830677-do-you-have-directions-for-the-burpee-clock-), so wanted to share in case it helps you get it running!\n\nthat is fuckin cool\n\nI have one of these!! A watchmaker will be able to set the time and schedule (and maybe source a key - it's a very simple key!). What a blast from the past!\n\nThat is awesome!\n\nVery cool\n\nBeautiful\n\nVery cool.  I would love it if they still made them\n\nWow! I would like to see that run too!\n\nI have a very similar one,  it's on the wall above my desk.  It doesn't say Burpee though.\n\nVery cool !!!\n\nI have one too. Found at an antique store. I love it so much!\n\nWe had the same one!\n\nWhat a beautiful treasure!\n\nSo cool! Love it!\n\n\"It's almost harvesting season!\"\n\nThought I was in r/whatsthisworth for a sec\n\nWow send it to Burpee and suggest they bring this back\n\nThis would actually be pretty legit because the clock was for their centennial and it's now 50 years later, so they could reasonably choose to do a reissue for the 150th. I bet they'd get a lot of interest.\n\nI'd like one of these\n\nWow! I would love to have something like this.\n\nWow! how cool!\n\nAmazing!! Have it fixed!!\n\nWhy does it only have seven sprout or pot symbols on the page though? All at one side?\n\nMy dad had the same one. My mother brought it over to my house and I hung it wrong and it fell and broke the frame.\n\nThat's awesome!\n\nHmm wonder what Antiques Roadshow would say? So cool!\n\nThat's amazing! It would look so good in my house!\n\nSoo Cool !\n\nLove this\n\nhas a patent date of 1975 so at most 49 yrs old\n\nI have that same one!! Bought at thrift store years ago for $5\n\nWanna sell it?"

Congrats!\n\nEnjoy!!\n\nBubble bobble!\n\nThe best game of its time 😁 one of my favourites\n\nwell, time to have the music in my head for an hour\n\nI thought that game was called Bust-A-Move\n\nDifferent game, same characters.\n\nCan we have some tips. I'm on year 4 atm\n\nHonesly patience. Only thing I really did was once aweek give it some kind of fertiliser and trimmed any leafs that were looking abit not so good. Mine was also grown in a pot due to lack of space\n\nThank you, got it\n\nTips from a friend but we are in tropical area, so not sure if it'll work in your area.\n\n1. When the plant got mature enough, trimmed off (half way of the leaves) most of the bigger leaves (mostly outer leaves). \n\n2. Burn some tweets or leaves to collect it's ashes. Mixed into warm water (best is the rain water collected and place under the sun). Pour it over the plant.\n\n1.\t⁠Pineapples grow best in temperatures between 68°F and 86°F. Temperatures below 60°F and above 90°F can slow plant growth, and freezing temperatures can kill the plant.\n\n2.\t⁠Pineapples prefer at least 6 hours of direct sunlight per day, but can grow in partial shade.\n\n3.\t⁠Water pineapples when the soil is dry to three inches deep, but don’t let the soil get soggy.\n\n4.\t⁠Fertilize pineapples in small amounts every 6 to 8 weeks.\n\n5.\t⁠Space pineapple plants 36 inches apart to allow for large fruit.\n\n6.\t⁠Pineapples can grow in a variety of soils, including sandy and calcareous soils, as long as the soil drains well.\n\nThank you!! The temperature part already rules my country out lol\n\nBubble bobble tat is sicckkkk\n\nI bet it was the most delicious pineapple 🍍 ever!\n\nIt seriously was\n\nNice job, OP!\n\nMine also took about four years. Not at all worth doing from a \"production\" standpoint, but TOTALLY worth doing from a FUN standpoint.\n\nThose plants get *big*. Big and SHARP.\n\nI like how they look, though. I considered doing more, purely because I loved having them outside in the summer, but they're space monsters. Our house is small and I stabbed myself on them many times. (I know you can cut the leaf tips off, but I preferred not to.)\n\nI couldn't agree more. I loved the challenge of it but probably won't be doing it again. \nI still do have 2 other bushes one is flowering 😁 but after them thats it. \n\nThe bush is beautiful but ah a pain if you dont have alot of room like me. I acttaly grew mine in a pot. In the ground somewhere away from where you wanna walk would be so much better. \nThe amount of times I've been cut etc from it 😅\n\nTips please, \nI have tried this multiple times but it was never successful.\n\nOnly thing I really did was once aweek give it some kind of fertiliser and trimmed any leafs that were looking abit not so good. Alot of patience. Mine was also grown in a pot due to lack of space \nI also started off the pineapple top in water until it grew roots then planted it out. \nGotta make sure the top drys for afew days before putting it in water\n\nThanks a lot for sharing, I started the same and it's in pot only. \nAny specific fertilizer were you using? \nSince it grew indoors zone shouldn't matter, I guess. \nMight just have to wait for next year.\n\nVery cool! I tried once, but it never matured.\n\nShe’s beautiful 🥹\n\nOmg. Does it take 4 years for one to grow or it took 4 tries?\n\nI have one that's been growing for 3 years and I'm still waiting for my pineapple.\n\nOh! Wow. Thanks for sharing. 3 years to grow 3 minutes to eat, tastiest fruit imo\n\nYay!!! I've the same pineapple top growing for eight years and still nothing. I'm impressed\n\nWow 8 years 😬 gees. Do you have any photos? I could imagine it's a pretty big plant\n\nNope tiny little thing\n\nI envy you! I had a beautiful plant growing for two years then i got a puppy and she ate it 😭 I JUST WANTED ONE PINEAPPLE. just one 😩\n\nWell pineapple is yummy.\n\n👏👏👏👏👏💕\n\nCongrats!!!!!!\n\nVery Cool!\n\nGood job! How did you go about it? I’ve never been successful.\n\n Only thing I really did was once aweek give it some kind of fertiliser and trimmed any leafs that were looking abit not so good. Alot of patience. Mine was also grown in a pot due to lack of space \nI also started off the pineapple top in water until it grew roots then planted it out\n\nGood job\n\nCongratulations! Looks yummy!\n\nCongrats!\n\nGood work!\n\nGoodjob!\n\nThat is awesome!!!! 🍍\n\nIt's beautiful. Congratulations!\n\nProud of you.\n\nHoly goodness... i have given up so many times (twice)! Will try again- thanks!\n\nlove that tattoo though!\n\nLove the pineapple and also love the bubble bobble tattoo ☺️\n\nBeautiful! Congrats!\n\nClass where are you? Any tips?\n\nNow that you did it, what will you do with it?\n\nEat it? 🤣\n\n😋\n\nWas it not the best pineapple you've ever had? Picked at the absolute pinnacle of ripeness and not early as fuck.\n\nThe best never tasted a pineapple so fresh and ah delicious\n\nWow congrats! What was your feeding schedule like?\n\nThat color is perfect, the rinds would make a really good tepache!\n\nWas it tasty? It looks pretty yummy. \n\nExcellent!\n\nDefinitely show this off at r/KnightsOfPineapple!\n\nCongratulations\n\nWow! How does it taste?\n\n( I’m harvested my pineapple last year and it tastes very sour )\n\nOh and it looks so ripe and juicy\n\nWOO! Well done!!\n\nDid it taste better than one you would get in the store?\n\ncongrats!  it looks great!\n\nI was taught by the man who showed me how to raise pineapples that with these fresh ones we can save all the scraps to use for juice.  The skin and the core gets chopped up, boiled until soft, then juiced (and strained) for fresh pineapple juice with minimal waste.  I love the stuff.  Though, I would never try it with the green store bought ones since they are not ripe in the same way as the fresh picked orange ones, but idk.\n\nI heard that if you put rotting apple cuttings at the base it helps it take less time to fruit. \n\n\nMy plant was not doing much at all the first year growth wise but I started the apple thing every few weeks and it’s definitely growing faster. I’m sure I have awhile before it fruits but it is fun to watch it grow.\n\nHe did it. He really did it.\n\nYay🍍🍍🍍 enjoy 🩷🩷🩷\n\nLooks so sweet! Congrats !!!\n\nMy mouth watered just by seeing this 🤤🤤 wish I could try some!! Congrats on your home grown pineapple!\n\nParaphrasing from comedian Jimmy Carr:  That’s convenient, isn’t it?! Cos you don’t live near shops and [pineapple] isn’t fucking cheap(!) Oh, I’ll just make my own. That’s fine. Cos the [water, feetilizer, and other materials] cost more than a [pineapple] but don’t worry about it.\n\nWaaaaaaah that's awesome :D congraaaaaats\n\nCongratulations! 🎈🍍🥲\n\nI'd like to try to grow one, but I don't have a greenhouse. Would it survive a UK winter on a windowsill?\n\n4 years..wow! 👏👏 congrats\n\nHow do you polinate them ?\n\nthis is really special\n\nJust don't gift it to someone 😂 I heard it causes uproar\n\nI’m in the Midwest and I had two pineapple plants growing indoors. Both died last spring cause after 3 weeks of 70+ weather of course there is a cold snap. Last month while cleaning one of the dead stubs I saw it rooted again. So back to square with this tough gal.\n\nAyyyyye 🤩\n\nTHAT'S AWESOME! Growing a pineapple from seed in most cases will drive you crazy, but it’s great to see it finally pay off. I think keeping it consistent with care is key. Have you noticed any tips that helped make the difference?\n\nMine is about 4 years old now but no fruit yet (I started it same as you, rooted a crown in water). It's huge. I only water it, what did you use for fertilizer?\n\nCongrats! Growing a pineapple takes serious patience\n\nHell yeah\n\nWoohooooo! Congraaaats!\n\nAll the swingers coming to your yard with that delicious come-on ;)\n\n  \nNicely done!\n\nPineapples that are harvested RIPE, all golden and delicious are the friggin best on earth.  My family farmed pineapples in puerto for a while and getting out there are sneaky ripe, smaller ones was one of the greatest memories I'll ever have!\n\nNow here in Atl....you're kinda inspiring me to grow one in a pot haha.\n\nYum!!!! I hope it was as delicious as it looks\n\n1. Pineapples grow best in temperatures between 68°F and 86°F. Temperatures below 60°F and above 90°F can slow plant growth, and freezing temperatures can kill the plant.\n\n2. Pineapples prefer at least 6 hours of direct sunlight per day, but can grow in partial shade.\n\n3. Water pineapples when the soil is dry to three inches deep, but don’t let the soil get soggy.\n\n4. Fertilize pineapples in small amounts every 6 to 8 weeks.\n\n5. Space pineapple plants 36 inches apart to allow for large fruit.\n\n6. Pineapples can grow in a variety of soils, including sandy and calcareous soils, as long as the soil drains well.\n\nCongratulations! Persistence paid off!!!\n\nYay!!\n\nWow, congrats!\n\nSuch an accomplishment!\n\nAwesome bro\n\nWrite a tutorial! Lol good job.\n\nHow did you start and what was the process? \n\nI enjoy trying to grow odd things.\n\nHow did it taste?\n\nDid it take four years??\n\nI have one planted this will be 3rd winter in ground. (Fla)\n\nIt looks good, congratulations\n\nCongratulations!\n\nOmg!! How did it taste??? Sweet??? Sour?? :D\n\nNow on to feed the world 🤣👍\n\nLOOKS JUICY AND DELICIOUS YAYYYY!! HAPPY FOR YOUUU\n\nWow!! Great job. Did it taste alright?\n\nNice!!! 👍🏼\n\nThat's a beautiful pineapple 🍍 Well done 👏\n\nAre there seeds in it\n\n[removed]\n\nWell…… we’ll just tell mother we are it all"

Freaky\n\nOP is  Dr. Guntram Shatterhand.\n\nA while back someone posted a different sort of murder garden.  (Highly poisonous to people garden)\n\nThe Mutter Museum in Philadelphia has a poison garden and a medicinal plant garden.\n\nHopefully the interns don't get them confused when sent to gather some medicine\n\n“Feed me Seymour”\n\nr/savagegarden\n\nYou send the kid in there to make them drool for the camera?\n\nKid is also carnivorous\n\nOp should really let the kid inside sometimes though.\n\n🤣🤣\n\nis one kid per day enough to feed them all?\n\nUsually it takes at least 2 kids to keep them happy.\n\nI have a bunch of annoying kids on my street. They're chubby too. Your plants will be pleased.\n\nSend them my way!\n\n/r/savagegarden plug incoming, in case you didn’t know about it\n\nEdit: Your most recent posts indicate you very much know about the sub lmao, gonna leave it for others though\n\nI’ve been posting there for awhile now as you found out, but this is my first post here. I thought I’d post here to get others who haven’t grown these wonderful plants an inspiration to start doing so. They are great fun to grow especially when you start breeding and growing them from seed.\n\nThis is amazing and the sub too! I do native gardening only but we have some native carnivorous plants and this has inspired me.\n\nI’m happy to inspire!\n\nWhere in the world do you get seed for these guys?  Very cool BTW!  What do you grow them in?  Peat?  Peat plus soil mix?\n\nI make my own seed from crosses I do with my own plants, but there are numerous carnivorous plant nurseries online which you can purchase seeds from. I use a 60/40 mix of peat/coarse perlite.\n\nThey really are beautiful, especially that red and white one in photo 2. Did you decide on a name for it?\n\nI’ve always heard they can be finnicky with soil and humidity requirements—do you have any tips or info you could share for success? (Even just copied old comments or links to them)\n\nYeah I’m ready to dive down the foxhole after seeing your post\n\nCurious what type of climate you live in where these do so well?\n\nI live in the panhandle of Florida. Zone 8b.\n\nWord, shout out to you for letting us know. First I’ve heard of this sub!\n\nGreat sub.\n\nWas also a name of an early 90's duo, who had a few good songs.\n\nThe entire lyrics to “I Want You” have been taking up valuable real estate in my brain since 1997.\n\nI have to look at my watch to remember what day it is but I’ll never forget chicka cherry cola\n\nThat was always my go-to for karaoke night when I wanted to show off  =)\n\nOh man I forgot about them!\n\nI had too till about 5 years ago and stumbled upon them in YouTube. Brought me back to the 90s.\n\nThat’s impressive. Do you grow them\nfor commercial purposes or do you just like them?\n\nI just grow them for my own enjoyment. I occasionally will put one up for sale on eBay. My sarracenia collection is small compared to many growers on the west coast and in Europe.  I need more!!!😜🤪\n\nDo you have a lot of bugs in your house? Or less than your neighbours?\n\nI probably have more bugs in my backyard since the plants attract them, but that’s the way I like it. I love bugs as much as I love my plants.  My three boys love going in the backyard searching for cool bugs to play with.\n\nBut what about mosquitos. Those are not cool at all. Do you not have any with this many carnivorous plants\n\nI have no more or less mosquitoes than my neighbors.  The sundews I grow amongst my pitcher plants catch some of them though. Mosquitos here are only active when it’s cooler in the morning and right before it gets dark. They hate the sun and heat during the day.\n\nAh. I live in the south where there are so many mosquitos it’s like curtains.\n\nI’m in the panhandle of Florida which is considered the south as well but I’ve heard that way down south in the Everglades the clouds of mosquitoes will carry you away.\n\nDucks can fix that for you. They eat the larvae. So if you have standing water and backyard ducks, then you'll have way less mosquitos.\n\nIf you have standing water, eliminate it. If you can't, use mosquito dunks to kill the larvae.\n\nThat's the thing about growing North American carnivorous plants, the pots sit in trays of standing water so mosquito dunks are a requirement.\n\nBeautiful, every one of them.  Where do you live, what zone or area ?\n\nHis insta says Tallahassee, FL.\n\nI bought one, once. Kept it alive for 2 or 3 years but this year its not doing so well. I had it in too warm of an area over winter and it grew a bunch of weird, light starved pitchers. And then I put it outside in the spring when things were mostly above freezing and everything almost died off. I'm hoping it'll just come back after some good sunlight. Apparently I did pretty well for my first one. But now I want more! I also have a sundew, and a reverse osmosis water filter so it's a good place to be a carnivore usually.\n\nHow do you feed that many? Is there enough local insects or do you have to supplement?\n\nMother Nature provides all the food. Sometimes she provides too much.\n\nAnd for the watering? Aren't they marsh plants thus need a constantly moist soil?\n\nNot quite marsh plants. They are bog plants and the soil needs to stay moist. These are all in pots sitting in trays of water. I allow the trays to dry up between filling to help control the mosquito population.\n\n[removed]\n\nUnfortunately, my tap has too many dissolved solids in it (high tds) so I use rain water from rain barrels and from my RO filter when it doesn’t rain enough.\n\nThey only eat one every few weeks no ?\n\nFeed me Seymour\n\nScrolled way too far for this lol\n\nWow. They are beautiful. Thank you for sharing.\n\n No problem.  My pleasure!\n\nYou could sell tickets to visit that place.\n\nOne of the most impressive things ive seen, i cant get over how many there are\n\nThank you!  There are some behind me as well.\n\nIncredible, do you have an estimate of how many plants??\n\nNow that's a \"no fly\" zone!\n\nSave the butterfly.\n\nButterflies rarely fall in due to their large wings. They mostly visit the collection to get drunk off the nectar and then they fly off in circles.  I then see the same ones return the next day and do the same exact thing.\n\nSave the butterfly from themselves\n\nIdk sounds like they're living their best lives\n\nCame here specifically to ask if they eat the butterflies!\n\nDo you find they noticeably reduce the mosquitos in the yard for you?\n\nNo mosquito reduction at all. Mosquitoes are too small to get trapped in the pitchers. The sundews (sticky  carnivorous plants) I grow amongst my pitcher plants do reduce them a tiny bit.\n\nHoly cow!  That's very impressive!\n\nThank you!  They are fun to grow and just stare at.\n\nAs much as I would LLOOOVVVEEE to have this... They wouldn't survive in Michigan.\n\nActually they probably would be fine! I think the common pitcher plant can even be found in places in Canada, and I've definitely seen them growing in a couple nature preserves by me in michigan.\n\nThey were a lot smaller though.\n\nThat's preserves... With lots of money and extra care.   \n\nDon't know that they would do well in a common garden.\n\nI have quite a few plant friends in Michigan who grow Sarracenia in pots and more them into their unheated attached garages or basements for the winter and the plants do fine. They would also do well in an in ground bog with some pine straw and snow on top for insulation during the winter.\n\nNo shit?  \n\nMaybe it'll give it a go next year?\n\nThey actually grow all over.\n\n[https://michiganflora.net/record/2661#](https://michiganflora.net/record/2661#)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/52a7h5u59jyc1.jpeg?width=750&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4ae6bcfa2313e92d06d3ba8c1a6d8b45bfadf7a1\n\nI’ve seen wild pitcher plants in the northern parts of the eastern UP. They can survive here, it’s all about finding the right variety I think? Plus keeping them happy. The ones I saw were in a real swampy meadow in mid summer, deep in the forest. Like, miles from the nearest road.\n\nMaybe I'll give them a run next year after research.   \n\nMy only fear is the bees getting into them. I have a good little swarm that visits my front garden during summer from a hive at the top of my block.\n\nThis is jaw-dropping. They look very happy. Masterful!\n\nThank you!  Growing them brings me great peace.\n\nAhh yes..the Garden of Death. \n\nHaven for humans. Hell for Insects.\n\nMy eyes have not seen so much beauty in one place.\n\nA few?\n\nDamn I would love a garden like this but with 3 kids and 2 dogs that wouldn’t last more than couple hours but damn if that isn’t fucking beautiful\n\nI have three boys 4, 6, and 8 and a dog and they know better to mess with daddy’s plants. They are very gentle with them and enjoy hanging out amongst them.\n\nThese are so awesome! Never tried these before\n\nTry growing them now!  I’ll have to warn you, you will get addicted to growing them!\n\nWhere do you live? I've been wanting to grow some after having SOME luck (not always) w/ Venus Flytraps. I live in TN (SouthEast TN) &amp; would love to have a few pitcher plants! Can you share what varieties they are?\n\nI live in zone 8b. You should have no problem growing and species or hybrid Sarracenia. My collection consists of all the species of Sarracenia and many hybrids I have made throughout the years.\n\nAmazing collection and photography! Did the monarch get eaten?????!!!!! 😭\n\nIt didn’t. It was just drunk off the nectar. The large wings of butterflies generally make them too large to fall into a pitcher.\n\nTEACH ME YOUR WAYS OH GREAT ONE.\n\nOmg those are beautiful. I would love to grow some in my garden, can you recommend any variety that would live in NYC?\n\nOmg-legend\n\nThat is epic!  Beautiful!!\n\nThank you!  They are very easy to grow.\n\nDo you prune them back in the winter?\n\nI prune off everything that is brown and crispy.\n\nThese are breathtaking! As a beginner gardener, I am curious about their growth time and name.\n\nThese are Sarracenia or North American pitcher plants. They actively grow spring, summer, and fall. They go dormant in the winter and then come back the following spring.\n\nMy carnivorous plants bring all the bugs to the yard. \nAnd they’re like, it’s better than flowers.\nDamn right, it’s better than flowers.\n\nI was looking at this thinking I really need these for the amount of flies we get.  (Swipe to next picture) Not the butterfly! 😭\n\nStunning! Love the colors on display.\n\nI have a couple hanging pitchers that are now a few year old, one is happy covered in small pitchers. the older one started with massive pitchers over a foot in length each but seemed to get sunburnt and the pitchers died off.  Moved it to a shadier spot and it seems to be recovering nicely, but no new pitchers forming yet. After having said “pitchers” so many times, the word has lost meaning.  \nThanks for sharing.\n\nThank you!  You have some type of Nepenthes and they do require a lot less direct light than the ones in the photos which are Sarracenia.\n\nBeautiful\n\nThank you!\n\nWow wow wow this is so beautiful 😍\n\nDoes it help with mosquitoes\n\nThat young man doesn't look as worried as I feel he should be. So many! I'm curious about the butterfly... I'm sure those colorful pitchers attract polinators. How do the plants survive if they eat their polinators, though?\n\nTheyre so pretty!\n\nCool! How does it smell? They get alot of Flys? I have so many questions\n\nIt smells kind of sweet amongst all the pitchers due to all the nectar. And they do catch flies like crazy but they won’t get rid of fly problems if you have one.\n\nYour pitchers are gorgeous. What zone are you? what area do you live in?\n\nThank you!  I’m in 8b in Tallahassee, FL.\n\nAhhh, they love that humidity, i bet! Here (9b, California) even in a bog, I cant keep them alive. Not inside or outside. 😞\n\nI have many friends in California and desert conditions who grow them with no problem. Humidity isn’t that big of a deal for Sarracenia like it is for Nepenthes. Just keep them in a tray of water and they should be good.\n\nIf Im ever tempted to tey them again, I'll keep that in mind.\n\n[removed]\n\nWow!\n\nI love these! So cool\n\nAbsolutely glorious!\n\nWoah! More than a few! That’s a ton! Looks amazing!! 🤩\n\nSo cool!!!\n\nA few!?\n\nWe need more bugs, not less.\n\nNo zombies are getting into your house.\n\nThis is incredible!!\n\nBEAUTIFUL! They look incredible!\n\nThis is beyond amazing! I have never seen so many in one garden!!\n\n[deleted]\n\nThis is one of the most gorgeous things I've ever seen.\n\nThat really is a labour of love. Looks incredible. Like you've slapped a slab of bog right in the middle of your garden.\n\nI must say this is so fascinating and they look so healthy. I'd be in awe if I saw this in person\n\nThe provincial plant of Newfoundland! They look lovely, well done!\n\nYou’re the person Plants vs Zombies is based one\n\nI'd love to know how many insects you get around your property compared to neighbors. What an awesome garden, thanks for sharing\n\nDo you source all yours ethically? I’ve been looking for some but come across some sites that obviously sell poached.\n\n[deleted]\n\nI've never seen more than like 1-3 carnivorous plants in one place before, they look so beautiful all together like this!\n\nWow! That’s beautiful. Thinking about it is a little freaky, but it’s beautiful!\n\nIf I didn't live in Colorado I would probably grow a bunch of these.\n\nOne of your plants is technically an animal.\n\nLove that, i got a venus fly trap a few years back but i couldnt keep it alive unfortunately\n\nI've seen you post before. Pretty awesome. I need so e of these for a yard south of Houston. To many flying insects. flys esp. When is that one your devoloping going to be for sale ? I seem to remember a rarity you posted saying you where almost done.\n\nWOW So many in one place it’s amazing and magical. You must not have any fly problems?\n\nPlease share your state and zone. I am in SWFL zone 10. The sun would probably bake them here. But we have lots of flying insects, I would try this if zone works out.\n\nI’m in the panhandle of Florida. They grow wonderfully in all parts of Florida.  Many people in zone 10 grow them successfully with little problem.\n\nWow. Just wow!\n\nbad day to be a fly\n\nWow. I’ve never appreciated these until now. And you are a fantastic photographer too! Thanks for sharing.\n\nNot a fly in sight lol\n\nY'all don't f#k around with mosquitos, huh\n\nWow! What kind of soil do you have?\n\nThese are absolutely beautiful!\n\nBeautiful\n\nOh my goodness, is your yard available for tours??\n\nI actually have a couple who has been traveling across the country coming tomorrow for a tour. I hope they are not disappointed!\n\nJust a couple murder plants. Not to many.\n\nI kinda want to start a garden full of poisonous flowers/plants.\n\nWait??? So those eat mammals????\n\nJust small children and an occasional stray cat.\n\nI don’t, but I want to now!\n\nDo you notice less flies? (Assuming flies are part of their diet, I am not well versed in this type of plant). These are absolutely stunning!!! So impressive thank you for sharing\n\nWow. What a stunning display. That's fantastic. Can you tell me a little about your soil Ph and texture? Those plants are beautiful.\n\nThe big garden of horrors. Very nice.\n\nWow one of them in the first picture really looks like a human… How did you grow it like that?\n\nCan they eat kids? Is that kid a sacrifice?\n\nGenuine question and no offenses to op: Would large quantities of these plants be damaging to the fauna of the area? Because off all the insects they kill.\n\nthey hunger for flesh\n\nWow. No fly problem in your yard!\n\n“a few”\n\nThey are native plants where I live. Our city has a small park dedicated to growing Venus flytrap and pitcher plants. They are extraordinarily beautiful. You have a beautiful selection. Nicely done.\n\n[removed]\n\nBeautiful. Bravo!\n\nThe child, too, is included in carnivorous plant?\n\nWow impressive.\n\n\nHow?\n\nWow, that’s pretty cool looking.  I don’t think I could grow them in my area. I’m in PA, zone 7.  \n\nI only have one little Venus fly trap.  It’s on my deck at the moment.\n\nReally beautiful!\n\nI just want to sit at the edge and STARE for a few hours 🥰\n\n Bugs don’t even drive past your house 😂\n\nfew?!\n\n\"a few\" 😅\n\nThey’re absolutely stunning\n\nAre there any insects left in your neighborhood? ;)\n\nBeautiful!\n\nOh my God, that's incredible\n\nare you in the carolinas??\n\nMe!!! I have also been enjoying taking care of a thriving collection of many different species from most of the many lineages!\n\nUnlike you, I live in a city that's also heavily polluted so I grow my collection entirely indoor, inside my own room on 11th floor of an apartment lol\n\nSo instead of being nurtured by the nature, my plants live under artificial lighting running on programmable automatic timer, and are watered with double reverse osmosis treated water (with 0ppm of TDS reading), and are hand fed by me with rehydrated freezedried mealworms and bloodworms. And I am very happy that I have managed to keep most of them absolutely thriving for over 2 years and half now :D\n\nThey are in my bedroom actually, and taking care of them the first thing I do after I get up every single morning has been an incredible boost to my struggling mental health and I'm incredibly grateful to them.\n\nI've also been really passionate in biology since I was little. I studied physics instead but I did take biology classes in uni too, and I've been really enjoying the \"Best way to study about a plant is to grow one yourself\" thing XD\n\nThat’s awesome! I grow my seedlings inside under lights so that I can push them to maturity much faster than they do outside. I actually live in the middle of the city, but I am fortunate to have a backyard.\n\nStunning!\n\nThis is awesome"

When I scrolled I initially thought it was origami.\n\nBeautiful! I’d like to know your growing secrets. I always struggle to keep them alive over winter.\n\nDahlias aren't supposed to be growing over winter; they die back to the tubers and regrow in the following spring.\n\nYou need to dig the tubers out and save them. They are not winter hardy unless you are living in a place that gets mild winter.\n\nWe have mild winters but lots of rain. Maybe they are rotting?\n\nThere are techniques of using heavy mulch for insulation and then plastic to keep moisture out to leave the tubers in the ground through winter in Zone 6-8\n\nWhat other people said. I dig them up every winter\n\nThey never look real with their perfect tubular petals. If aliens created flowers this would be the result.\n\nBeautiful.

    "all_comment_text": "Whoa... 3b??? I'm in Tacoma, WA 8a and I didn't get a harvest like that, nowhere CLOSE.\n\nI start everything from indoors that’s why I get a good harvest, if I wait till the season that to plant I wouldn’t get anything lol 😆\n\nYeeeee, always love your posts! Looking like a beautiful haul.\n\nThank you 😊\n\nAwesome!!!\n\nDelicious success!\n\nThose peppers look delicious, buddy! Nice haul!  Can't wait for next year!\n\nThanks and I’m excited for next year already planning to expand the garden again!\n\nWe usually harvest two dozen or so shishitos every week in summer, but they didn't do so well this year, so I have to explore that a little bit this winter. \n\nSummer was definitely cooler this year, so maybe that had something to do with it.  \n\nGood luck with your winter planning!\n\nAmazing! The bottom right bucket of tomatoes alone would be an exciting haul!\n\nBeautiful harvest!!! And the scotch bonnet looks amazing. Are you gunna pickle them, make a sauce or just throw it in the pot to cook ?\n\nwonderful!!!\n\nI’ve seen your profile before and I know your way up in Canada. Do you live off the harvest during winter?\n\nYe I’m near timmins and I still buy what I need but most of my produce tend to get us partially through the winter!\n\nI figured you were in Canada/Northern Ontario just by the landscape, but the Roots sweat pants confirmed that. And what better pants to garden in than a brand called Roots?\n\nDo you do canning to preserve your vegetables through winter? Great haul!\n\nI have done jarring, some stuff I’ve air sealed and frozen, and like my potatoes and other stuff just need a cool dark place to be stored.\n\nThanks for responding. I live in zone 3 so I was curious how you were able to extend their life over the winter.\n\nThanks for your reply. You’re a gardening superstar here on Reddit. I have so many questions just for my general knowledge. Do you have to contend with wild life in your garden? You must have long days during summer,  what time does it go dark during the winter? I believe from previous posts you were able to turn your landscape around from being sandy to a garden. You’re amazing\n\nThank you 😊 and I love having the wildlife in my backyard, they really help out big time I’ve had bugs and caterpillars, grasshoppers and they eat them all in my garden !, and the summers are not to bad but they are short, in the summer it still bright out till 9pm but summer does t start till about the second week of June, and ye it was all sand before but after years of buying soil lol I was able to bring it back to life\n\nBeing Jamaican, are some of those Scotch Bonnetts?\n\nYes they are first year growing them successful after trying for 4 years\n\nBeautiful! Nicely done man, I'm jealous.\n\nBeautiful harvest! I always enjoy your posts, and appreciate you sharing the bounty from your garden.\n\nThank you 😊\n\nBeautiful!\n\nDo you find that your spicy peppers cross pollinate with your sweet peppers? A spicy bell peppers sounds good.\n\nNo that didn’t happens but o found alot of the different types of bell peppers they cross pollinated to different colours which was cool!\n\nDope\n\nMake some cowboy candy, relish, you know, good stuff. Green tomato relish if you have any green tomatoes\n\nThose cukes 😱❤️\n\nMan, living the Good Life! Your harvest looks amazing!\n\nyou have a great set up, and tasty results all season if I remember\n\nCongratulations!\n\nSo jelly. Looks amazing- great job\n\nDayum\n\nBeautiful\n\nThe cherry tomatoes look amazing!\n\nSo beautiful, I love the colors.  Cheers to your success.\n\nThose tomatoes look amazing 🤩\n\nOMG!! this is a beautiful harvest!\n\nThis looks amazing! I started to plant my tomatoes inside this year too and i got a lot!\n\nYou are doing very good work, there.  Canning some of it?\n\nThank you and I did jarring and I air sealed froze, lots\n\nBountiful harvest!\n\nYessss! 🌶️🔥\n\nGreat haul! Are they in 2g pots or so?\n\nVery nice 👍\n\nGood job.  Everyone with room should plant veggies.\n\nBeautiful harvest!\n\nYou are an awesome gardener❣️🌸❣️\n\nLooks great! Great work!\n\nWow! Beautiful harvest! 😍 Nice work!\n\nMmm are you going to make the most delicious salsa?! Or eat them fresh?\n\n👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏\n\nSpicy boys!\n\nI zoomed in on those potatoes, they looking good.. Looking great my guy. Nice harvest. Great looking peppers and tomatoes too.\n\n🤤\n\nSo jealous of all of that good looking food\n\nThey look good\n\nI bought cayenne and got some those big reds I do not know what they are technically I pickle mine and dehydrate some\n\nI think these ones were super chilli peppers\n\nDelicious, I’d make a bomb salsa! \n\nWe have found that stressing or less water towards the end makes them a lot spicier. Found out the hard way.\n\nSorry peppers is what I was talking about\n\nYou have done well this season.  Congrats.  Our scotch bonnets, ghost and scorpion plants are still producing in 7b.  But Jack Frost is coming to visit.\n\nLooking forward to seeing your garden next season.\n\nThank you and that’s awesome ! I still have a few in my greenhouse that’s still surviving lol but old man winter could be here any day 😂.\n\nAnd for sure ! I plan on expand the garden next year\n\nCongratulations! Peppa dem look well hot bredda 💪🏽🇯🇲\n\nMuch respect family 🇯🇲\n\nA giant chillie.That's a big one.\n\nTime for a tasty feast! Congrats.\n\nThose tomatoes tho 😍\n\nI see you working brother! Gorgeous harvest.\n\nI love seeing your posts, cuz I struggle in Vermont with zone 4 growing.\n\nDo u normally plant outdoors or u start of indoors then bring them out ?\n\nI've done both, but this year I bought starts to make it easy on myself. Its just been a big learning experience of how to deal with the weather, soil, and pests. Deer ate my peppers, frost killed my pumpkins, racoons knock over my corn. Weeds somehow growing better than my starts. Always close to giving up every year until next spring comes around, lol. \n\n\nI grew up in Hawaii so watching your success in another cold climate is fun to see. Thanks for posting, I really appreciate it.\n\n🙌🏾\n\nThese are my favorite kinds of posts! Love seeing the big smiles and the fruits of all that labor.\n\nAlso, dude, those are some gigantic ass peppers!\n\nLove it!\n\nBeautiful!\n\nWhat a picturesque garden and scenery!\n\nNice, I’ve been trying to convince my girl to build a potato box and build it up an hopefully get lots from that method. Looks like a lot of good eats.\n\nI'm always stoked to see your posts! Well done, buddy!\nWhen do you plant your scotch bonnet starts in the ground? Curious how you can fit them into a short summer up north.\nI'm outside of Portland, OR, at zone 8b, and I've been doing scotch bonnets the last few years. This year we had a frost in late May that killed my peppers. I bought some more starts at a nursery, but these plants are so far behind that the fruit still haven't ripened yet, and we're almost hitting frost again.\nI doubt I'll have a harvest this year to make my pikliz.\n\nOops just saw that you grow your peppers in pots in a greenhouse, haha. That makes much more sense.\n\nThank you 😊 much appreciated and yea I start Indoor from the start of march, because they take really long to grow, and I wait till I know the frost is gone and that’s the second week of June for me, and if I do put them in the ground I wait till the end of June that way I know the soil is really warm, any cold sets them back like 2-3 week it’s trail and error it’s my first year growing them successfully after 4 years of trying.\n\nAwesome 💜💚💙\n\nBeautiful sir!\n\n&lt;ahem&gt;\n\n“Beautiful, Sir,”\n\nI’ve been to quite a few countries. But never Canada. I’d love to live there!\n\n&lt;especially right now&gt;\n\nMy grandfather had a degree in Ag and big farm.  Did lots of sustainable things when all his neighbors didn’t.\n\nI have 2 Permaculture Design Certifications, and have owned a 77 acre sustainable food forest jungle\n\nWorked with the best Permaculture minds in the world.\n\nI have been studying soil ecology, gardening, living totally more eco than almost anyone on the planet, and it’s SO EASY!\n\nFor more than 3 decades (three)\n\nPlease, anyone.\n\nAsk me questions\n\nWow, great job!"

That is patience!\n\nthanks !!!! we ate that little mandarin so quickly lmao\n\nCongrats on beating the squirrel to it!\n\nomg right?! 😂😂😂😂\n\nthere’s at least 4-5 little greenies growing , patiently 🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻  i’m so excited!!!\n\n😂🥰\n\nU know ? I grew a mango tree from an eaten seed and it took only 7 years to get mango in it , and omg my tree was full of delicious mangoes until we cut it down 😭\n\nIncredible! (So sad you had to cut it down!)\n\nI don't want to cut that down but I have to expand my house anyways That's why my mom didn't listen to me and cut it down\n\nCongratulations 🥳 well worth the wait i bet\n\nthank you :)) 🫶🏻\n\nWas this beauty from seed?\n\nwhen my dad  bought his house it was a little baby in the ground like very new and it’s been 8 years since that time and it’s now giving a few more presents :). the last two years it grew one or two. i’m currently taking care of anything that lives in my dads backyard , including succulents, a poor cyclamen, a fuschia, a mandarin tree, variegated roses, gravenstein  apple tree , and a cherry tree that has the most delicious cherries i’ve ever eaten.\n\nwhat zone are you in? im curious about the cherry type you have\n\nwe are in zone 9a , 9b,10a!! i think the cherries tasted more like rainier but were definetly were another variety due to their pinkish red color! I wish I knew it what variety it was! When I get cherries again, I’ll definitely be posting pictures lol\n\nCrying in zone 4...\n\nGravenstein is my favorite apple! I hope you get some from that tree.\n\nIt should produce more by this point. Are you fertilizing the tree multiple times a year?\n\nI’ve had mine planted for 4 years. Every spring I see white flowers. Are you saying I have another 4 years to wait for fruit?!\n\ngrown from seed can take 7-8 years to fruit, most fruit trees begin from being grafted onto mature root systems- this method takes 2-4 years for fruiting. if you know how your tree started you can better predict when to expect some fruit (:\n\nUnfortunately I do not know how it started, as I bought it at ~1.5 years old and immediately planted into ground. Maybe they’ll come soon!\n\ni hope the fruit comes soon!!!🤓🫶🏻🫶🏻\n\nOooo i never thought about mandarin trees\n\nIt always taste better when it's home growen.\n\nThis gives me hope for my mom’s lemon tree! We’ve had it a few years now and I’m still holding out hope lol\n\nFresh! They must taste so good! Congratulations!\n\nAmazing! Congrats! Persistence and steady growth pays off!\n\nthank you! we’re (me ) very excited 😂😂😂😂\n\nOmg I've always thought that fruit trees take too long but why not wait?\nThis is extremely inspiring\n\ni’m an extremely impatient person and I love instant gratification and this is taught me to slow down and focus on other things like just caring for something. Not expecting anything from it.!!!\n\nyou just explained me so that's really beautiful  :)\n\nr/mightyharvest would love this!\n\nWhat type of mandarins? Almost done on year 1 here\n\ni M not sure!!! it was here when we bought the house but it was just a twig and leaf at that point 🥹\n\nYay!! I got 4 on my tree which is one more than last year :) I'm waiting for them to ripen and trying so hard to not touch them hahaha  Missed the gorgeous blooms earlier this year so I can't wait for next year\n\nTIL what we call as an orange in india is called as mandarin in some places.\n\nMandarins are certain varieties of citrus that are similar to oranges. They are more cold hardy than regular oranges. \n\nhttps://citrusvariety.ucr.edu/citrus-varieties/category-or-type/mandarins\n\nyes. i looked up what a mandarin was and was surprised to find out that what we in India call oranges arent “really” oranges, as per the agreed upon western convention, atleast. We generally eat mandarines in India and just call them oranges. now that I think about it, i have come across an “orange”. It was imported from someplace and the shopkeeper termed it as “foreign orange”. The peel was so hard to get off and taste was not that great either. I prefer Indian oranges.\n\nThat looks delicious. Great job to you and your tree.\n\nthank you so much!\n\nI feel that iv been growing a tropical lemon \nTree for about ten years started bearing edible fruit at 6 years old\n\nmmm lemons are life!!!\n\ndid you grow it from seed? edit: found the answer\n\nOk, I’ll continue to have hope for my little tree! Congrats!!\n\nI have a tree that has 1 orange- how do you know when it is ripe to pick?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lh9iuz98vzwd1.jpeg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fdea658e8c44009adc5317a1162cf0e0d09baa59\n\nLooks like it’s ready to pick.\n\nThats so cool! What region do you live in for this to thrive outdoors?\n\n9a,9b , 10a!!!🫶🏻\n\nLooks really delicious. \n\nMy dad's in his mid 80's and this is the first year, as long as I've been alive, that he didn't put his garden out. It takes up a large part of our yard--cucumbers, eggplants, romaine lettuce, tomatoes, zucchini, bell peppers, sweet peppers, lots of hot peppers, and so on. Born and raised in Greece his father had a produce store. I have an old photo of my grandfather outside of his store.\n\n\nA friend of my dad's split his time between here [Indiana] and Florida. He brought my dad an orange tree and a lemon tree, to see if he could grow them here. They each were in their own huge pot and I carried them in and out of the house, as the seasons changed. Except for the one or two random oranges/lemons we got, it wasn't successful. \n\nLooking back now, after having watched a few YouTube channels about greenhouses, I wonder if he would have been successful if he would have kept them in a greenhouse, in the back yard.\n\nCongratulations! I hope you enjoyed the fruits of your labor.\n\nthank you so much!!\n\nThis is one of the most pictorically (is this a word? Non english speaker) satisfying and deliciously looking mandarines ever!\n\nthank you so much!!!!🥹🫶🏻\n\nMight want to get rid of the brick circle, that can have detrimental effects on the root system\n\nthank you for the info, i’m actually planning on doing that this week! i’m still learning how to be a better gardener :) appreciate any and all tips\n\nWuuuu!!! Bravo, mandarin trees are so generous, congrats! :)\n\nSoo natural\n\nCongrats!!🤩\n\nWow congratulations that's so wholesome!\n\n8 years???!!!!! No please no. Seriously??\n\nI bet you've been cheering on that tree in Mandarin this whole time!\n\nAlways nice to pick fresh fruit that is home grown \nI’m not sure why it took 8 years unless you grew it from seed or had some challenges along the way\nI would remove the rock from around the base and replace with a large pine bark nugget if you can find it in your area\nI purchase it at Lowe’s \nCitrus trees are pretty heavy feeders so perhaps you are not fertilizing enough\nI have 30 in containers and they are fed 4 times a year but container gardening always requires more feeding\n\nKeep cultivatin!\n\nthank you so much for the advice!!!\n\nMy pleasure I don’t know where you are growing citrus, but I grow in the Pacific Northwest and my plants overwinter in a greenhouse. While We very likely are growing in different zones, I am certain we are growing for the same reasons- a nice looking evergreen, with fragrant flowers and delicious fruits. Citrus trees can live for 50 years or more so it’s great to see them do their thing and enjoy their delicious fruit\n\nHope your trees continue to thrive!\n\npacific coast region here! i did not know that about citrus trees! i cant wait to see it grow more . i’m taking the bricks out this week and i’ll grab some fertilizer. there a ton of citrus trees in my area and they all have so many fruit alrwady!! amazing\n\nYes, they should have fruit set already as they tend to be harvested October through March depending upon the variety there are some varieties of summer oranges as well. I don’t know about other types of citrus that are ripe in the summer besides say lemons That always have some fruit If I were you and I saw someone who had a nice tree and they were out in their yard, or you had an opportunity to ask someone in your area, what they do that would probably be one method that I would use to learn more to gain success\n\nGlad to know it actually produces fruit. Still waiting on mine after about 5!\n\nWhat’s better than eating a mandarin? Eating Amanda out!"

I’d wear it to work with skinny pants and wedges - but closed toe wedges.\n\nTake my upvote for this fall season\n\nSame! I was like wow that’s an incredible painting &amp; had to do a double take when I realized it wasn’t\n\nI know at least three houses that absolutely need this painting to complete their aesthetic.\n\nI thought I was in the r/watercolor subreddit when I saw the photo.\n\nSame. It looks like a photorealistic watercolor painting.\n\nMe too! I thought someone had decided to paint \"Still Life with Flowers and a Snail\"\n\nIt's not?\n\nI desperately need to try and recreate it\n\nMe too!\n\nDitto\n\nSame\n\nMe too!!!\n\nNeeds to go on a drawme sub!\n\nCan a snail look guilty? Because this one absolutely does.\n\nCaught w a petal in his mouth. 👁👄👁\n\nGentlemen, this is democracy manifest. What is the charge? Eating a leaf? A succulent little leaf?\n\nNice one. Wonder how many will get the reference.\n\nGet your hands off of my shell!! 🐌\n\n👁️--------👄--------👁️\n\nI still want to pet it lol\n\n\"You're 86ed, buddy!\"\n\nNormally, I'd let this slide, but today I'm feeling salty!\n\nSnail shame.\n\nshname on him\n\nSHNAME 🔔 SHNAME 🔔 SHNAME 🔔\n\nSnorted so effing hard hahahahahahahah\n\nNo, but it does look delicious!\n\nEdit: thank you all for the up votes, -1 beats -14 in useless Internet points 😂\n\nHa sorry about your downvotes. I thought calling a garden snail escargot was funny.\n\nMost garden snails are escargot. It always amazes me that people will eat clams and oysters but draw the line at land mollusks...\n\nShrimp is bugs\n\nSame reason people eat cows and pig but draw the line at horse.\n\n[deleted]\n\nno but they also eat snails lol\n\nEating snails has been documented in the UK since at least the Roman era. They were just called \"wallfish\", so it doesn't come up in most searches.\n\nYou just gave me my new favorite word for land snail, totally calling them wallfish from now on!\n\nIt was. 👍\n\nHe's really making the \"surprised Pikachu\" face 😅\n\nWhat a beautiful giant snail! Where do you live, I’ve never seen that species before. Your flowers are gorgeous, but I hope you can find the space in your heart to share your garden with the wildlife. ❤️\n\nI’m in southwest Germany. No clue about snail species, but we have a lot of them here, including big ones. I relocated this cutie to the back of our garden, near the fence.\n\ni think theyre vineyard snails! theyre pretty large, and ive seen them in the netherlands\n\nAh, that makes sense. There are vineyards all around my town. (Assuming vineyard snails actually hang out in vineyards.) This is one of my regular walking routes.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vnvtd63rfxtd1.jpeg?width=1179&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a7d237eb6d48e16999710283ec2ddf9408348c6c\n\nOh, what a wonderful place. 🥰\n\nIt a vignette vinyard\n\nHave a glass of riesling halbtrocken for me.\n\nJust did with dinner!\n\nI really liked the snail photos, the vineyard photos and enjoyed reading this comment trail. What a wholesome thread :)\n\nWhat a stunning view\n\nLooks like heaven! And your garden friend is adorable.\n\nWe have them in Sweden too! Apparently they are edible, and were planted here hundreds of years ago because the nobility wanted escargot. Nowadays no one eats them, but instead they eat my plants... They have quite an appetite, but I can't make myself kill them...\n\nI was about to suggest butter and garlic as pesticide free removal strategy\n\nThey're delicious sauteed in butter. Gotta clean them out first in case they've been eating poisonous plants. I've used carrots, convenient since they poop orange once their gut is completely clear of whatever they've been eating outside.\n\nI've never heard of doing this before, but that's brilliant.\n\nHuh, never thought about this before but do they come out of the shell to poop?\n\n[They sorta poop onto their own head.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e1/Garden_snail_defecating.jpg)\n\nhttps://snail-world.com/snail-anatomy/\n\nFor some reason I automatically suspected this to be in Austrailia 😂\n\nThat's great you relocated them 'cus they clearly said sorry. Just look at them!🥺\n\nNever seen a snail look ashamed before.\n\nCan't find the English name, but German wiki says gefleckte Weinbergschnecke.\n\nLooks like Weinbergschnecke!\n\nGood . I love that !! This This !! All day long !!\n\nIt's mid bite like \"Guten Morgen\" 🫨\n\n\"Oh no! I've been found out. Run!\"\n\n\\*slowest chase in history ensues\\*\n\nI think I am going to paint this. Beautiful picture OP\n\nSame, gorgeous\n\n*I uhhhh...I can explain...*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1u70ie6eiytd1.jpeg?width=820&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c9b440d9c6763e52a3a14e66fc47b2e586610f1d\n\nThis is the cutest snail I've ever seen. Definitely worth a few mums!\n\nHe (or a friend) stripped every petal off every marigold I planted a couple of weeks ago, so I relocated him, but he’s definitely super cute.\n\nSo are you trying to convince us that first one isn’t the most adorable painting in the world?! I’d get it printed hahaaa\n\nI thought this was a portrait. Your flowers are spectacular.\n\nThank you!\n\nAs a photographer, I have to comment on how beautiful these shots are! The gardening side of me- I don't want slugs and snails eating my plants, but they're fascinating creatures! I also think they're cute :)\n\nThank you! And I feel the same way about slugs and snails. So adorable and I love seeing them in the woods. Don’t want them on my flowers :)\n\nHermosa fotografía\n\nFantastic picture! It even has a petal in its mouth!\n\nI got a great video of it chomping away and then slowly stopping chewing when it realizes we were staring at it.\n\nLet's see that please\n\nI thought this was a painting!!\n\nWow, that’s one big ass snail :D\n\nBut he’s so cute!\n\nFor a sec, this guy reminded me of Absolem from Alice in Wonderland\n\nOh my god what a beautiful picture it’s like something out of Alice in Wonderland or some fairytale!\n\n&gt; Alison Wonderland \n\n\nr/boneappletea :)\n\nVery cool photo, with the colors! I thought it was a watercolor painting.\n\nThis is my new phone wallpaper\n\nBlue?\n\nThis is your fault for planting all of those delicious flowers.\n\nThis is such an awesome picture, I might paint it\n\nThought this was a painting! Until I scrolled, this is great and I would frame it\n\n😁😁😁\n\nWhat a cutie!\n\nSnails are so cute and so destructive lol. (I do it have the heart to kill them, either)\n\nThis is an artistically perfect photo of this adorable creature, caught slime handed in the act.  I couldn't help but smile upon seeing this. At least he seems to have a real appreciation of your glorious flowers as he happily destroys them.~ 🐌🌸\n\nIs it blue??\n\nInnocent!!\n\nIt's so cute! I would allow them to keep eating my flowers\n\nliterally thought this photo was a painting 💗\n\nIs this a painting?!\n\nYour photos look like paintings, absolutely stunning!\n\n\"And I'll do it again!\" \n\nHe's not the least bit sorry for what he's done. 😤\n\nThat snail was having the time of his life! Glad you relocated him so he and your beautiful flowers can flourish. I’m not too familiar with snail habits, do you know if he will return to the flowers eventually or will he stay put for the most part? \n\nUnrelated- is it okay if I paint these photos?\n\nHis compliments to the gardener lol\n\nThis looks like a painting!! Beautiful!🥰\n\nThank you for not being too wrathful with the little fella.\n\nWhat a beautiful picture?  The first one\n\nThe mouth looks like an eye in the first image. It took me a minute to get it. My brain is so confused, more sleep sounds like a good idea.\n\nThat is a great pic!  I thought it was art, at a glance!\n\nso well camouflaged...and he is so bful\n\nHow could a snail eat all that ? It looks like a squirrel and I saw a rat running from mine . So rats squirells ground hogs rabbits skunks !! Beware of them all\n\nI thought the stray cat that's been hanging out in my garden was eating my flowers, but I looked outside one day and saw a squirrel rip a coneflower off of the stem and stuff it in its mouth.\n\nNot gonna lie, that first pic of it getting caught in the act is kinda cute 😂\n\nAwww cutiee 🐌🥰 Chomp chomp 😋\n\nHe looks Magical!! Also beautiful flowers!\n\nHe’s cute\n\nI thought this was a painting lol\n\nWell for a sec I thought this was a painting or something lol 😆\n\nThis is a beautiful picture\n\nR/snails would love this beautiful photo\n\nWhy is he so cute? 😭\n\nI’ve never seen a snail’s mouth before. That’s pretty cool!\n\nr/accidentalrenaissance\n\nThought this was a painting at first\n\nI love you, little flower eating garden snail\n\nIf not friend, then why friend shaped?\n\nWOW what a great picture of the snail!\n\nWhere are you that garden snails grow THAT big?!\n\nRascal!  But he’s beautiful.\n\nYo I thought this was a watercolour painting at first\n\nThe way you got them like a deer in headlights lol\n\nTo answer questions, since it’s hard to respond to everyone individually: the flowers are chrysanthemums (mums), the snail is gray and only looks blue because of the lighting, we have lots of snails this size or bigger in my area of Germany so it didn’t even occur to me that he’s particularly big, and I love snails so I relocated him to the back of our garden, away from the flowers.\n\nHe’s been eating well from the looks of it!\n\nBeautiful creature\n\nIdk he’s kinda cute 🥰\n\nwhat a cutie!!! 🥹\n\nWow that’s like the cutes snail ever lol\n\n...this is the point where I move. I've never seen a snail that big! It could be someone's pet.\n\nHe’s cute\n\nYou must live in a warm and humid part of the country. We have winter in IL and it insures that we don't have 3+ inch insects/mollusks.\n\nThe reason I can't have dahlias. Or lillies. Or anything that isn't a bush, really\n\nBetter than most artworks nowadays\n\nit can change color? 😵‍💫\n\nare you going to send it back to it's home planet?\n\nFantastic image!!\n\nMove along\nNothing to see here ☝🏼\n\nIf you made this into a puzzle, I would buy it immediately. Beautiful!\n\nIt's blue\n\nHe's cute enough I'd probably just let him.\n\nOmg I love snails 😍\n\nWhat a cute fat little man\n\nI'm curious about why he looks so blue in the first picture and not at all in the other\n\nThis looks like art. I thought it was a painting.\n\nI LOVE THEM\n\nHoly shit that first pic looks like a watercolor painting 🖼️\n\nGreat shot!\n\nThat look like a painting to me.... \nBeautiful?\n\nHe’s just a little buddy. I want to pet him 🥺\n\nOmg can I paint the first pic? It is so gorgeous I love it 😭😭💕💕\n\nThe first pic looks like a painting. I love it 🥹\n\nWhat kind of flowers are these? They’re beautiful\n\nFirst pic looks like a painting\n\nAnnoying for the flowers but this baby is super cute\n\nJust having chrysanthemum yum yums.\n\nthis is so cute\n\nIt looks like it’s thinking: “damn, caught in the act!” 🤣\n\nThat first photo is pure art, put that on a canvas\n\nI consider it a big success when the animals eat my garden.\n\nI thought it was a painting 😭\n\nThat face is too adorable to be mad at 😭\n\nGet revenge. Escargot are delicious.\n\nKidding, they are delicious, but only some kind of garden snails should be eaten. I freakin' still hate them for the damage they can do to my garden!\n\nWhat a beautiful slug!!!!  Transport it elsewhere!!!\n\nLooks like someone has a taste for flower!\n\nThis is the perfect wallpaper background thank you\n\ncan I use this as a wallpaper. its so cute\n\nNo remorse 🐌\n\nBeautiful flowers, and a beautiful snail.\n\nr/snails\n\nSurprise pikachu snail\n\nYears ago I put out corn meal &amp; water; and enjoyed Escargot! (no really, it was great)\n\nHe's not eating much. Let him enjoy it.\n\nOh he's handsome\n\nSentence them to garlic and butter!\n\nLet him munch!!!!!\n\nwhat a slime ball\n\nI love them 😍\n\nWhat a beautiful picture sorry about the flowers though\n\nHe’s innocent\n\nfirst pic the snail is like 😟\nsecond pic the snail is like 😔"

    "all_comment_text": "Awesome! Those look amazing! How do they taste? \n\nUses (assuming they taste like kidney or black beans): Chili, blue beans and rice, bean salad, refried beans, winter bean feast, or anything that wants a kidney bean.\n\nThey taste exactly like the red kidney bean. I‘ll make rice and beans with them the next time I make oxtail\n\nOMG I need these. My little son loves beans, especially kidney, but often asks why there are so few foods in  his favourite colour blue. He loves  harvesting as well and this will be such a blast next summer. Thank you so much for sharing!\n\nThis is so wholesome, I love this for you 🥰\n\nThis is so random but you should read the Percy Jackson books to book, the main character loves blue food lol\n\nThank you, we just got the first book, but for his older sister. I'll make sure to include him :-)\n\nOh I love oxtail… does your rice and beans include saffron?\n\nI NEED THESE!\n\nOh! I would use them with kidney beans and cannelini beans for a patriotic 3-bean salad for the summer holidays!\n\nNow those are true \"navy\" beans.  (Yes, I know they're really kidney beans because I did read the original post).\n\nI love your comment\n\n😂\n\nNow I must grow these along side the Scarlett Runner Beans, next to my Purple climbing beans, and behind the Dragon Tongue bush beans. I am aiming for the weirdest bean bed ever.\n\nDo your purple beans retain their color when cooked?  I have purple pod pole beans and their pods turn a dusky green when cooked.\n\nYeah, I have the same purple beans...they go dark green when cooked. And while we're at it, I'll mention that the Dragon Tongue beans turn white when cooked and loose their pretty purple streaks.\n\nI love Dragon Tongue beans.  If you want to enjoy them AND their colour do a vinegar based refrigerator pickle of the fresh pods.  You can eat the pod and bean together if you harvest just before they're mature.\n\nOohh...nice tip! This is the reason this sub exists for me. Thanks!\n\ni’m loving this thread because i’m looking to collect bean colors for my garden beds, those royal burgundy beans that go green when cooked got me hooked. would love to eventually have a bed of different colored beans growing and am just envisioning a rainbow in my harvest basket 😍\n\nI'm so jealous. I developed a sensitization allergy to beans after being veggie and vegan for several years. So I'll have to live vicariously through everyone's beautiful bean footage.\n\nWhat kind of allergy is that if I may ask?\n\nSensitization allergies are allergies you develop later in life to things you're exposed to often.\n\nInterestingly, the purple pole beans turn green when blanched, and then turned BACK to purple when I dehydrated them. Freezing them, however, they stayed green.\n\nYES! A gardener after my own beans 🤗\n\nWhen you've got these fun-to-eat options, why be boring?\n\nHow about make a blue chili by adapting a white chili recipe. You could call it ‘Romulan Chili’\n\nThose are fantastic\n\nIsn't Romulan chilli is against the law?\n\nWhat a gorgeous colour\n\nI’m curious since most blue or purple food are high in antioxidants if this bean is higher than a regular bean. What zone are you in?\n\nI am in zone 7a (Toronto). I love growing stuff with high antioxidant and they do very well where I am\n\nWhere did you get the seeds? Locally?\n\nThese would look great in a navy bean soup thanks for the info.\n\nLots of regular store beans are darkly coloured already that's not really a big motivation to grow your own.\n\nMy motivation is my own.\n\nI grow dry beans too. I'm just saying, you can buy black beans at the store, so antioxidants wouldn't be a reason to grow some yourself.\n\nNice! 👏👏👏\n\nCurious how you plan to cook it and how it tastes.\n\nI have only boils a few bean to see if they remain blue which they did. I am still trying to figure out what to do with them. They are a blue kidney bean\n\nShould do Cajun style red beans and rice, the blue should add a cool presentation and it’s a delicious use for kidney beans\n\nThey stay blue?! That's awesome.\n\nMake chile\n\nWow awesome bean. Can you post a picture when they are cooked?\n\nWow!! Those are amazing! Where did you get them?\n\nhttps://store.experimentalfarmnetwork.org/products/sacre-bleu-bean?srsltid=AfmBOooE_CCEMvi9HkkKJB2SVZ5c43uzQH2TKK3wy_Oc3EDhupBocxnT\n\nThey are currently out of stock, but after your glorious photos and fun post, they are going to be stunned by how many \"notify me when in stock\" requests they get!\n\nThanks for sharing, I just HAVE to grow some!\n\nYup, I put myself on that list.\n\nI also got ‘San Bernardo Blue’ Beans from them as well. It is another blue bean they offer. Hopefully, I'll have a chance to grow that one next year \nhttps://store.experimentalfarmnetwork.org/products/nonna-agness-blue-bean?srsltid=AfmBOorQ_be6FmEmv2_f2eHLSmpO-y20R2lqDIxSeceNHE27GJfHBqhe\n\nSo fun!  I also looked at those from the link you posted and I'd settle for them ...  but I admit to be especially interested in beans that STAY blue with cooking!  I am an artist so I not only want to grow them, I want to paint them and then paint some food made with them.   So much fun!\n\nTHANKS again for sharing that link!\n\nI already have four different varieties of beans/peas I’m going to be growing this Spring, so I don’t need another one. That said… I also put myself on the list to be notified lol\n\nYou may not NEED it, but......\n\nIsn't that what a lot of our gardening is about?  I grew eggplants one year even though I don't really like to eat them, I just wanted to paint the flowers.  My friends ate them for me.\n\nThank you very much 😊\n\nThey don't sound like something I'd be able to grow in Florida :/\n\nPerhaps starting them in early spring, like January- February, when it's still cool?\n\nGorgeous--and the fact that they stay blue during cooking is amazing!\n\nAnthocyanins? I might give those a go, I am always on the look for purple stuff, half decent documentation around for that it is a good anti inflammatory, and even of not? It looks cool.\n\nYou should try the Norfolk Purple tomato. It breeds for more antioxidants, I think you would like them\n\n[https://nocoastseeds.ca/products/bean-sacre-bleu](https://nocoastseeds.ca/products/bean-sacre-bleu)\n\nDid this just happen, or did you buy them to do this?\n\nI brought them. The variety is called  ‘Sacre Bleu’ bean. I also got another blue bean called ‘Nonna Agnes Blue’ which I will be growing next year\n\nBeautiful! What kind?\n\nThe variety is call ‘Sacre Bleu’\n\nEsos frijoles son hermosos! Me recuerdan a mi infancia 🥰.\n\nWow!\n\nThis is so cool!\n\nAre these a heirloom bean? And they are really blue?\n\nSo cool! Getting inspired for next year !\n\nWow, those are gorgeous.\n\nBeautiful\n\nDude that’s awesome!!\n\nSTUNNING!!! what kind of bean are they called I might have to grow a whole bed next year\n\nVery cool. I want them.\n\nOh, I love fun colored crops, they're gorgeous! Congrats, and enjoy!\n\nPossibly the most gorgeous beans ever?\n\nThey look like fantasy beans! Pretty blue, I've never seen blue kidney beans before. 😄\n\nWhoa. I want to grow this next year how cool \n\nThere are almost no blue foods. This is amazing.\n\nare those magic beans?? amazing!\n\nYou managed to find the one bean I didn't grow this year xD\n\nI've never seen blue  beans before! those are  gorgeous!\n\nImagine the polyphenols in these! Amazing\n\nBeautiful\n\n😍🤩🥹they are too beautiful💙\n\nhttps://giphy.com/gifs/season-16-the-simpsons-16x11-3o6MbsT5NgoQAUldPq\n\neat them to connect to your bluetoot device\n\nLooks stunning! Would be good to paint a bedroom (or living room) wall in this color 💙\n\nohhh my gosh these taste like red kidney beans you said?? i’m 1000% getting these for next year, the color is STUNNING! i have royal burgundy bush beans that are a gorgeous purple color pod but turn the normal bright green when cooked. i am so intrigued by vibrantly colored vegetable varieties and have a small bucket list goal to grow as many as i can. i hope you enjoyed your harvest! 💞\n\nI'm  going to have to find myself some of these to grow next year\n\nThis is really awesome!\n\nWhat a beautiful blue!!!\n\nThose look amazing!  Since they stay blue when cooked it would be such a surprise to have them if you weren't warned a head of time.\n\nThat's amazing. I've never seen anything like it .\n\nSacrebleu!\n\nWow! Where did you get the seeds? I would love to have some to grow\n\nGoing to say it …Cool Beans!  Thanks for sharing.\n\nThis is the coolest thing I've seen all day, thanks for sharing!\n\nThese are so cool! Can you post a pic when you cook them? I’d love to see how that affects the color\n\nim wondering if you can turn these into food coloring or even better usable paint, the color is gorg!!\n\nWas it difficult/any different to grow them compared to your other plants?\n\nDamn, I thought my flambo beans were beautiful!"

I then learned that marmot is the more common global term while groundhog is an anglo eastern Canadian and northeastern USA thing!\n\nI've only known them as groundhogs raised in fla adulting in the Smokies (Sevierville) I didn't know they were even cashed anything else lol\n\nno ragrets\n\nOh, I thought he looked kind of sorry about it.\n\n\"oi mate, are you planting new kale anytime soon?\"\n\nHahaha was thinking the same thing.\n\nGuilty AF\n\nPoor Frank just loves a good free buffet 🥹\n\nHe has that “oh and by the way, I prefer the Kale you planted last year” look as well.\n\n“Are you fucking sorry?”\n\nNarrator: \"Frank is not sorry\"\n\nNOOO I WAS GONNA COMMENT THAT\n\ndid make me laugh though (even though it was the joke i was also about to make)\n\nDamnit Frank\n\nGod damnit Frank\n\nClassic Frank\n\nFFS Frank\n\nCame here to say this LOL\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p47sokq6cxfd1.jpeg?width=1300&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a85b8531f2d2d1c6e24a667511af6e7001ab4407\n\nOP right now\n\nMy solution works a little better against Fred.  He/she only eats the weeds which is nice. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/diowjkw14vfd1.jpeg?width=1024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6804ca7bd151865f76d4883f49f63e95346caec6\n\nThe things we do for $20 worth of veggies. \n\n(I’d do the same)\n\nCan’t put a price on the satisfaction and knowledge of exactly where your food came from though 😅\n\nAnd the satisfaction of out doing those buggers.\n\nThe satisfaction and the taste. There is nothing better than homegrown veggies. Especially tomatoes. Gardening season is BLT season for us. Our favourite summer sandwich. Mmmm.\n\nHomegrown cherry tomatoes are my obsession - specifically the Supersweet 100 and Sungold varieties. I’ve been using them in salads, and they make a very tasty sun dried tomato! I’m also big on pickling, so this summer has been full of cucumbers, and several heirloom bean varieties (fresh beans make the best dill pickles!)\n\nWe can only grow cherry tomatoes because anything bigger catches the attention of every rodent in the neighborhood, and we're just growing tomatoes for the squirrels at some point.\n\nI have a ton of neighborhood squirrels (2 black ones!), and 7 wandering deer… 3 rabbits, and an occasional woodchuck. The thing that stopped them was a chicken wire / goat paneling enclosure for the sides and roof. The greatest thing about the goat panel roof - it’s strong enough to tie up the tomatoes for support. Even though the Supersweet 100 and Sungolds are cherry tomatoes, they’re indeterminate. All of my plants are nearly 8’ tall, and constantly produce through late fall!\n\nWhat’s your bacon plant secret?\n\nStrawberries and hardly $20 worth.   And these are much more economical than premade ones online.  Go to Gardener's Supply and see what I mean.  Also this is a ONE TIME COST and will allow me to have years and years of strawberries.\n\nwe forgot our Depression era wisdom: buy bulk calories but grow flavor &amp; nutrients at home \n\ni ain't buying those expensive tiny packs of fresh herbs ever again lmao\n\nIt is outrageous. $5 for a tiny pack of herbs at my grocery store. A bundle of fresh basil is like $8.\n\nI'll shell out money for plenty of things but mint...? You can't even stop mint from spreading if you tried. I'm not paying $5 to make a couple mojitos every now and then.\n\n  My neighbor asked me if I had any dill I could spare, a friend was making pickles. The friend wanted to know how much he owed me for a couple handfuls of scraggly dill that I’d just trimmed the seed heads off of. \n   I told him nothing of course, \n  Thinking “wtf pay me? It’s just dill …?” But then I remembered the $5 ‘fresh’ herbs in the grocery store, and the vendors at the farmers market, so I told him “look it grows on its own, I don’t plant it, don’t water it, but it manages to keep out the dandelions. I love it but I don’t cook with it, it’s purely for the bugs (and therefore birds also) to eat and enjoy.\nIt cost me $0 to grow dill this year, so you’re welcome to take some if you pay me $0 in return”\n\nYes oh man the self-seeding stuff especially SHOULD be a free-for-all. I have a ton of fennel and I never have to plant any it just regrows itself. That sort of stuff should be in every neighborhood.\n\nYeah its so funny. Sage is another great one. It's a cold hardy perennial shrub that expands readily. The only herb I can't manage to grow enough of is rosemary. Not the right climate.\n\nIf you lived near me I’d give you some. I barely even water mine and it’s HUGE. Near Thanksgiving I post on the buy nothing group to offer herbs for cooking because I hate the idea of people spending $20 on things like sage and parsley and rosemary that I could never use up myself.\n\nMy partner just paid $4.98 for one damn onion. Granted, it's large but *five dollars* for an onion??  METRO is just as bad as loblaws superstore. Food cost is out of control.\n\nwhat?!?! wow.  Was it wrapped in goldleaf?\n\nRight? I don't even want to open it. lol\n\nI have complained about onion prices so many times now my family is probably sick of it.  Went to the local Cub early this spring and bought an onion.  Only realized after looking at the receipt it was $2.50... for one freaking onion!  Complained to everyone in my family about how the hell is one onion $2.50?  Onions and potatoes and carrots are supposed to be the cheap staples.  Anyway, my brother went across town to the Hy-Vee and I told him to get me an onion since Cub is obviously on crack thinking people will pay so much for one onion.  He got home and I asked him how much it was.  It was $2.75!  So I guess that's just what onions cost now.  In other news, my brother picked up a single shallot from Cub recently and it was $6.  6 freaking dollars for one shallot.  These are not challenging crops to grow!  What the hell happened?\n\nNeedless to say we planted both shallots and onions in the garden this year.\n\nSeems we're being *fleeced* while grocery store conglomerates grown wealthier and wealthier. They're like banks now -- ripping us off for every last damn cent, meanwhile their profits are exploding record highs.  There oughta be a law. ahem.\n\n[deleted]\n\nPlant that 🧅\n\nlol. and then I think of all the things commercial farmers do to keep pests away and I think maybe its worth it to grow my own.\n\nMeanwhile, I let some kale go to seed a few years ago and now it grows in the cracks of my sidewalk, in my yard, behind the trash can…\n\n“That time we grew kale in prison.”\n\nKale jail. \n\nWhen it's time to harvest, it will be a kale break\n\nHa! Nice :-)\n\nThis one little strip of this post has given me SO MUCH HAPPINESS TODAY!! 😁😄😁\n\nI'll never look at kale the same way again!!\n\nI only eat cage free kale.\n\nWE KNOW, FRANK\n\nGeez Louise I just about spit out my yogurt at your comment. Hysterical!\n\n😂😂😂\n\nI prefer free range kale\n\nthat's plant abuse!\n\nOurs is named Hoagie. He's upset that I put up a fence. [https://i.imgur.com/wd1bLDd.jpeg](https://i.imgur.com/wd1bLDd.jpeg) [https://i.imgur.com/C2r2yJh.jpeg](https://i.imgur.com/C2r2yJh.jpeg)\n\nCan you link these cages? Where are you getting them?\n\nI don’t know where these came from, but they reminded me of rabbit cages! I bet you could use those if you drill some holes in the bottom.\n\nOne day I had a thought, it hurt, LOL!!   I went online to Amazon and looked at wire storage cages, both 12.4\" and 14\".  These are 14\" and clipped together with hog clips which I had from a fire pit repair. Cable ties will work well too and netting is needed for chipmunks. You can link them anyway you want but it gets awkward if too large.  You can also cable tie the netting or chicken wire to them.  I have some in back as triangles with chicken wire for the bunny.  I use square ones in some pots to keep the squirrels from digging in the pots.  It is distracting from the flowers but they finally give up and I can remove the cages.\n\nI don’t see the guard towers with rifles in this photo.\n\nHa, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!! After years of losing most of my strawberries, I had to go postal!!\n\nI do this with strawberries\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/689jb6xbgvfd1.jpeg?width=2591&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ee5a97ca1dceab099fa3d5cdce812ae5f6ab6a3d\n\nMy defense against Fred\n\nWait...we have the same dog!\n\nCan you believe this guy got one too?:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xtslvwbotvfd1.jpeg?width=2421&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c7d1a65d60eda73be897b22d1f6a0e37793509dc\n\nWoah, not bad for a dog who needs braces!\n\nHey, the vet says his teeth are fine. 😆\n\nObviously good enough to get the job done! Good boi!\n\nDanger Chiclets!\n\na lot of small dogs were bred to hunt vermin so it’s definitely possible! one of my mom’s friends has a small dachshund that ran off during a park visit to shake a rabbit to death\n\nFor sure! This boy has some terrier in him so he has an insatiable bloodlust for groundhogs in particular. Even tho he’s about the same size.\n\nmeanwhile my sweet little english lab was a bit spooked when one somehow got into her yard 🫠 she just stayed on the opposite end while the thing freaked the fuck out trying to phase thru the fence\n\nThat’s a good dog. Groundhogs have pretty sharp claws so they can do some damage (they don’t just run like a rabbit will). Looks like your pup is a veteran though.\n\nCaught my dog catching his 4th groundhog of the year last week.  The groundhog is, who was not keen to take evasive maneuvers, was caught then my walker coonhound just straight up shook the Jesus out of the poor thing.  It was an admirable defense of the garden.\n\n‘Shook the Jesus out of the poor thing!’ ROFLOL I can so picture that. Belly rubs all around!\n\nThese Fred references keep screwing with me because my dog's named Fred 🤣. He's never caught a chuck, but he's pointed them, and I've shot a couple. A slow cooked woodchuck with garden potatoes, onions, carrots, and herbs is an awesome meal.\n\nI have a dachshund. He just wanted to be friends with the groundhogs. Mighty hunter not.\n\nCongrats\n\nI'm at a point this year. My garden is for the ground hogs. If they leave me anything, I'm great full to them.\n\nWe have our own (we call him Fred) who ate our garden and then moved on to our car wires. I’m not kidding— car’s in the shop and he has since tried to climb up inside any car that’s parked in the driveway 😔\n\nFred's got issues\n\nI’ve been wondering if it’s because he’s single.  Looking for love in the very wrong places.\n\nApparently, a lot of car wires are coated with a soy-based coating these days. Same thing happened to a friend.\n\nYes! This is what the repair shop said. They said almost every car that comes in these days has some form of chewing damage. 🙈\n\nI think some wires nowadays use a soybean based resin to produce the coating. Cheaper that petroleum, but it is vegetable based and critters know it.\n\nOoh mine ate my air conditioner wires and water line! Glad it’s not just me. Lol\n\nlol we need a support group\n\nI had some mice chew up the wire harness inside my Mercedes. They had to pull the whole ass floor,seats, center arm rest, door panels all off it was down to the frame inside. Mice poop and sashed food all over hell some like like 37 wires had to be replaced/spliced. Nightmare. \n\nGarage in a city neighborhood, no fields or woods for blocks.\n\nMine dug under the shed, under the buried 2x6s, and into the chicken coop for oats. Twice.\n\nMy husband grew up on a farm, and said they have literally taken out barns with the holes they dig.\n\nI have a Gus and Mrs Gus and gus jrs\n\nThose woodchucks are evil. We hit a raccoon for $1K worth of damage, and a woodchuck for another $600, all this spring. I swear they jumped out at the last minute in front of the car.\n\nI never knew they could do that, that’s good to know! I think your Fred was out to get you! Haha!\n\nJust eating the leafy parts and not the stems, too!! Frank YTA. All the downvotes. Boooo.\n\nFrank is responsibly practicing \"cut and come again\" harvesting.  He wants more kale in September.  😉\n\nThat's Frank's \"you should have planted more kale\" look\n\nDammit Frank! Can't take you anywhere!\n\nMy groundhog (Phil) eats bites out of each tomato and bell pepper methodically and leaves them on the plant to rot. He drives me crazy.\n\nMy dog has been obsessed with him ever since he decided to move in under our barn. He always stands in front of the fenced in yard and taunts her.\n\nJust the other day, he was suspiciously far from his hidey hole and again, taunting my dog. So.. I let her out of the fenced yard… I’d had enough of his shenanigans. She proceeded to chase him and actually CAUGHT him, but had no idea what to do… lol she just pinned him and was like wtf? I never thought this day would happen, let him go out of shock and then he ran back. So my dog is useless 😂\n\nThey gotta catch a few before they figure it out sometimes.\n\nI sometimes walk a genocidal poodle who has killed almost 20 groundhogs. We went to the dog park a couple of weeks ago: no dogs, just a groundhog. I got to see up close and personal how long she takes to make sure they are dead.\n\nMy dog chases them, but when he actually came across a frozen-in-fear groundhog up close, he just sniffed it and walked away.\n\nGENOCIDAL POODLE 😭😭\n\nHi, I'd love to get in contact with that poodles owner. Our neighborhood is overan. 3 in my yard, 2 in my neighbors next door. One across the street.\n\n[deleted]\n\n\"Not my fault u didnt plant enough\"\nFrank, yta!\n\nIf anything he is saying \" More, please \" with his paws.\n\nClassic Frank.\n\nFriggin Frank 🤌\n\nMy groundhog (Bill Murray) ignored the kale for years. Not this year! This year he decided to get healthy I guess? All kale, GONE.\n\nFrank hired you to grow the kale so grow more damn kale!\n\nI'd be mildly upset but that one is so damn handsome I'd plant him some more\n\nOur ground hog is named gobston\n\nMy backyard groundhog (Mo) and I have come to an agreement. I feed her greens and she leaves the garden alone.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cli7oc4t0wfd1.jpeg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7aa12b70b006044bddb23fa8a6d8f2b20f8c1ee7\n\nWHY, FRANK! WHYYYYYY??? \n\nHere, Felicia ate half of a tomato plant. Leaves, green tomatoes, stems - all of it.  It's indeterminant and has since recovered, although not entirely. She also ate a pepper plant. \n\n Two seasons ago, either Felicia or Donna Deer and her kids ate all of my kale down to stups. But the stumps regenerated and the kale was thicker than ever!  That was unexpected and felt very confusing to me!\n\n***Donna Deer***\n\nGreat name. We finally put up a Donna Deer fence. They ate the leaves off all the pepper plants and left the stems and peppers hanging (chili and jalapeno). Looked like little Charlie Brown Christmas trees. The beans they ate everything and left stumps.\n\nFuck you frank!\n\nMy groundhog is also a Frank! Except now short for Francine because she had the cutest babies. It’s a tumultuous relationship! She ate strong zuchinni plants down to the root! This prickly leaves? I’ve never seen anything like it she’s a monster.\n\nLmao! We named our yard demon Francis a few years ago. We.. dispatched.. of Francis but turns out he had babies. We haven't yet dispatched of these now-massive groundhogs but we've named them all Francis as well 😆\n\nSo far a giant wall of mint keeps them away from our veggies, oddly enough.\n\nWe trapped ours and took him about 10 miles away and gave him a new home. Bastard had to be shaken out of the trap, he wanted my veggies so bad. Buffet is closed buddy.\n\nWe have a Lyle that turned out to be a Lylette. Every groundhog that lives in the shed is Lyle. OG Lyle and their kin have lived in the shed for maybe 20 years.\n\nUgh FRANK 😩\n\nFranks got no remorse and is proud of this!\n\nFrank the tank\n\nMy doggo just took down Frank #4 this weekend 🫣\n\nMy dog has attempted to take down Frank’s cousin. The only problem is that he’s almost 12 and about the size of Frank. He gets an A for effort though.\n\nAnd what breed of dog is this? I need one!!!\n\nWe have a GSP (German Short-haired Pointer). Ours has also gotten a few Franks. Great dogs, very high energy though.\n\nWe adopted a GSP and she became practically nocturnal because of her love of rat hunting. She'd sit under the trees all night waiting for them to come down to forage. Crazy girl.\n\nMy Staffordshire bull terrier is a stone cold ground hog killer. He’s 7/7 against them. Won’t kill anything else just ground hogs idk what they did to him but he’s got a vendetta against them.\n\nSame! Doggo is good friends with the neighborhood cats but hates the groundhogs with a passion\n\nCan I borrow him for a couple days? My 12 lb. Terrier mix tries, but he’s the same size as them 😂 He does good work of our moles though. \n\nI’ve offered this service to neighbors lmao - she caught one within 15 min of being over there\n\nWe’ve caught 12 this year with traps. But there’s one bugger who climbs the 6’ fence and broke out of the trap! I’m terrified of this super groundhog reproducing! \n\nMy beagle/dachshund is this way with moles. She never digs unless she's killing one and she doesn't kill anything else. When she found some baby bunnies in the garden she just laid there watching them. She also enjoys chasing squirrels but will never even attempt to bite them and she could've easily caught more than one. But moles get shaken and thrown through the air in a violent rage. 🤷🏼‍♂️\n\nI love your dog\n\nNot 100% sure. Gotta do a dna test or something! Rescue place said she’s a min pin x cattle dog - about 30 lbs. I heard terriers do a great job too!\n\nNeighbors have a GSD shelter mutt that has bagged 3 franks and 3 rabbits this season alone. Countless squirrels too.\n\nMy GSD’s have kept my yard free and clear. Both rescues.\n\nPlant him some more… he’s looking rather on the thin side compared to all my “Franks”\n\nOh! I too have a Frank! I recently dumped a bunch of special blend of marinated kitty poo and pee down it's hole.  I hope they like it!\n\nFourth time I’ve had this happen and this time if I don’t go home to it in my live trap I’m buying some welder’s gloves and pulling him out the hole at night\n\nI'm after a skunk in my garden but EVERY TIME I bait my live trap and set it out in the garden I catch a possum (which doesn't bother my garden at all) and once I caught an enormous raccoon who ALSO didn't do any harm to my garden. I throw garden trimmings for them along the edge of the woods. A squirrel took one but if my acorn squash but ig it didn't like it. And another squirrel pulled down 2 stalks of corn that weren't ready yet but it was ready enough for them. I'm fighting squash bugs and cucumber beetles!! They have done more damage than any mammals I have around. And I have a lot!! Possum,squirrel,coon,groundhogs,chipmunks,rabbits,cats, etc. so far the insects have been the biggest asshats to date!\n\nProving once and for all something out there will voluntarily eat Kale\n\nEat frank….then you have eaten the kale\n\nHe's left me no other choice\n\nFrank ruined my entire garden this year. I'm currently researching ways to evict him without hurting the other animals that roam around my garden area (local cats and dogs) so that next year I get to eat from my garden\n\nThere’s another option: Frank might be tasty over the coals. 🤷‍♂️\n\nRevenge is a dish best served… hot?\n\nMy woodchuck neighbor has been sticking to volunteer Red Clover (have at it, buddy), and invasive Goutweed (yes!). Yours needs some manners, or some weeds.\n\nLOL. He didn't give a crap about that fence did he\n\nThis is why I rented a plot in a nearby community garden. Too many rabbits, squirrels, voles and a huge groundhog in my yard !  A friend of mine had her neighbor shoot a groundhog in her yard. ( illegally, shhh).\n\nGive that neighbor tomatoes!\n\nLook at him,  he has no shame...\n\nNo that’s Steve\n\nLooks like Alan to me. Alan! Alan! Alan! Al! Al! …. Nope, you’re right, must be Steve.\n\nAre there any sacrificial things you can plant to keep him satiated?\n\nI vote for kale😂\n\nLucy for him he’s cute.😬\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c8wdcqmtsvfd1.jpeg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd0d163c3411975abd92b7ddff5e5a468301e831\n\nI finally caught my Fred and released him in the next town 💪\n\nThat's not Frank! [That's Alan... or Steve?](https://youtu.be/xaPepCVepCg)\n\nThat little shit, he is standing there wanting more too😭 how th hell did his little belly do it. I’m sure he came back a few times😭\n\nLook at him. Zero regrets.\n\nI would’ve kaled him\n\nThat's ok - I didn't want any kale. \n\nthanks Frank, you did us all a favor.\n\nI planted a lovely garden hoping to channel Monty Don but now I have nothing thanks to a family of deer and a bounty of bunnies.  I feel your pain\n\nYou just need to plant more Kale.\n\nSnails did mine in, go Frank!\n\nGarys can eat a lot.\n\nSorry for your loss but this made me lol.\n\n(in Hank Hill voice) \"Damnit Frank!\"\n\nWtf Frank?!\n\nDammit Frank!\n\nEffing Frank.\n\nFrank looks like a cool guy.\n\nLuckily I don't have any Frank's in my yard, have some wonderfully destructive deer frenemies instead. But the park where I walk my dog has enough Garys (what I called all of the Franks) to drive her in a super powered pulling frenzy every 15 mins. They literally scream if she gets too close to them/their burrows o_o\n\nI named mine Bill\n\nHe looks so happy tho lolol\n\nHe doesn't look like he feels guilty about it either!\n\nNo kale for me, thanks though... I wouldn't mind frank though. Win win if you ask me\n\n“Ummmm, we’re out of kale! I’d appreciate it if you planted more asap! Chop Chop!” -Frank \n\nHe's got that look that says, \"hey, we're out of kale.\"\n\nFrank that Fuck\n\nWhat the fuck Frank?\n\nThat’s a mercy killing tbh\n\nthe face of a criminal lol\n\n… but look at Frank’s sweet face\n\nWhere’s my pellet gun I converted into a hot sauce and beer salt gun I’ll make him think twice\n\nThis shit made me laugh fr! thanks op💯❤️🤙🏼\n\nI've just about had it with Frank that greedy f*cking tw*t\n\nI don't know why I find this to be so funny 😂\n\nThank you Frank.\n\nFuck you, Frank.\n\nYou seem to be franks private chef"

    "all_comment_text": "Until this moment, I’ve been completely unaware of the potential of petunias\n\nThey're so pretty, aren't they? The galaxy petunias were just pure magic to watch all summer and the black one looks exactly like velvet, I love them!\n\nOne of my favorite flowers, and such a wonderful scent!\n\nOmg yes!!! I love the scent too! Hummingbird moths went crazy for them, especially for the pink ones\n\nHeat and humidity help control how these mix ones appear.\n\nIt's so interesting! :)\n\nMay I ask where you bought these at? Did you start by seed? Thx…They are absolutely beautiful!!! 💜💜💜\n\nThey're \"Night Sky\" petunias, they've been around for quite a few years now and aren't rare. Wait until spring and then start visiting your local nurseries, and I'm sure you'll be able to find some. \n\n\nETA: I double checked, you can't get seeds. They're a patented variety that is propagated through tissue culture, so look for plug plants. \n\nI got them at my local farmers market. I haven't seen them in big box stores or local nurseries yet, so I can only hope that I will be able to find these varieties next year too :) I was thinking of looking the seeds up online, just in case\n\nI've used galaxy petunias in window boxes 6ish years ago, so I know they've been around at least that long. However, they sell out so fast. I've seen them very briefly in places like Lowe's. I've ordered them from nurseries too.\n\nI'm not sure how hard they are to propagate. They do have a tendency to revert to their solid coloration with stress or age.\n\nOh I should probably just order them too! Thanks for the tip! :) the kind people of the subreddit let me know that the seeds of the galaxy ones are not viable and most of those ads online are scams, so I'll do as you do, and order the plants next year.\n\nPeople also mentioned that I could propagate cuttings or overwinter these plants, but I am not sure I am willing to do that with all the pests I had this year, with all the spraying and repotting I did this year, I am just done for 2024 haha but it is also a great option!\n\nAbsolutely gorgeous. Thank you for sharing them. 😍\n\nThank you for looking at them! :)) they are so mesmerizing!\n\n[deleted]\n\nI got them as starter plants at my local farmers market\n\nYou can't buy seeds for them, they're a patented variety propagated by tissue culture.\n\nThere are also some genetically engineered ones that glow in the dark.\n\nI have one! They're neat!\n\nPotential of Petunias, great band name\n\nPetunia Potential\n\nI found a wild petunia growing in my yard years ago. Had no idea what it was, but I spotted the purple flower when I was mowing and decided to move it to the flower bed on the side of the house. That tiny little thing turned into an absolute unit... climbed up the 6 foot fence and spread at least 10 feet across. It smelled divine, too, and the scent carried a long way.\n\n\nDomesticated petunias are cool too, but I will forever be disappointed with their scent after knowing their full potential.\n\nThere is also a glow in the dark petunia. They're very expensive but worth checking out.\n\nThe reason is that the biological processes that make the starlight color pattern depend on rather strict temperature ranges, both during the day, during the night and the difference between - if the temperature (or the difference) is off, you can get either ends of the original colors/patterns.\n\nThat's so cool, thank you so much for taking the time to explain that to me, I kept wondering what happened! Thank you! :)\n\nSomehow that makes the outcome all the more fascinating to me. Even though we know why it does it, it still has that element of magic to it almost\n\nYou might be interesting in learning that petunias also produced another type of \"magic\" - one of gene suppression mechanisms was discovered by a scientist trying to make petunias more purple: he added more purple genes and was surprised when the petunia turned out white instead. Linked an old article, as I cannot find the story in \"regular\" language, even though it's often mentioned in scientific stories as it lead to a fairly recent Nobel prize: [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/how-an-experiment-to-change-the-colour-of-a-petunia-led-to-a-breakthrough-in-the-treatment-of-cancer-and-aids-5547175.html](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/how-an-experiment-to-change-the-colour-of-a-petunia-led-to-a-breakthrough-in-the-treatment-of-cancer-and-aids-5547175.html)\n\nabsolutely gorgeous, every single one of them!\n\nI think so too! Those colors are mesmerizing :)\n\n#11 &amp; the black one are my fav but they’re all so cool\n\nBlack one is my fav too! :) 11 is so unique and seemed to grow even better/stronger than the rest (though the rest grew amazingly well too!)\n\nThe black is just incredible it looks like a velvet black pant suit my mom would wear when I was younger around the holidays. \n\nYa 11 with the rotated pattern perfectly on each petal is just so crazy too it’s like Hawaii or Fiji in a flower\n\nAw it does look like black velvet! :) And I haven't even realized until your comment but 11 kind of sort of reminds me of hibiscus flowers!\n\nI used to grow them to give me a warning when the caterpillars started attacking. They stop producing flowers when they are being eaten. Then I knew to spray the rest of my crops with BT. They would start flowering again in a week. \n\nI had a couple volenteers in their pot a couple years back. They were a hybred if purple nad pink flowers, producing a nice wine color. So I took it in to see if I could over winter it, \n\nIt did very well and I'm on the third winter with it now. I cut it back a week or three before I bring it in, leaving 2 inches of stem that then sprouts new leaves. keeps them manageable.\n\nThird winter? Wow that's awesome! Love it! \n\nI collected seeds too and can't wait to see how all the possible hybrids will look like next year. These plants are so much fun!\n\nIn Arizona petunias last through the winter. They struggle in the summer due to the heat and need constant water. I have terracotta spikes in all my pots to help with watering. I had to fill a 32 oz bottle every day for the one petunia that survived. It’s still doing well.\n\nWhen I moved this to no sun area and the flowers turned white. This spot gets morning sun. Proven Winners Bubblegum petunia.\n\nThis is one plant.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bzw0ccfbs51e1.jpeg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a5eefa69279a44f89c7823d08f1bf8e8e9d9705\n\nWow it's so beautiful! Love it! it's so interesting how the color can change. Your plants are gorgeous! :)\n\nLove it! Have previously seen all sans #11, though my favorite is #9.\n\nSame, #9 is my favorite too! :) #1 is a close second to me haha\n\nInterestingly #11 was more red than yellow all summer long and turned more yellow as the weather turned colder\n\nNice!\n\nThe galaxy and black velvet lookin ones are my favorite tbh. (Might consider attempting to grow some.)\n\nSame! You should absolutely give them a try, it was magical to watch them bloom all summer long!\n\nHow do you get petunias to do…. Literally all of that. Not asking for a friend.\n\n[removed]\n\nIt does look like that! :) The colors are just magical on that one, I love it too!\n\nIt's like staring into a galaxy.\n\nOP, these are all vegetatively grown genetics and are considered sterile so do not produce seed that is true to type. Most are from the Headliner and Starlet series bred by Selecta. The black one is named Starlet Velvet lol. Headliner Night Sky has been one of the most popular vegetative petunias for years now, so larger nurseries should have them or something similar every spring. Most often sold in 4\" to quart pot sizes.\n\nAw that's a bummer! Thank you for letting me know, I've been collecting seeds (or what I thought were seeds lol) so enthusiastically 😅\n\nI second this! I work in nurseries and we have been getting these for years. Night sky was the first one but they’ve branched out much more in the last couple years!\n\nAwesome! I live in a smaller town so it either took a couple of years until these started to be sold here or they were always just so popular that they got sold out before I had the chance to see them! :)\n\nAsk if your local nursery has a call list, maybe they can let you know when they come in next year🥰\n\nWill do, thank you for the tip! :)\n\n[removed]\n\nI love them, and I am sure you'll love them too when you get them! I found them at a local farmers market in the spring\n\nBeautiful!!\n\nAll I have are the pink ones.\n\nI would love a good source for the other colors. Especially the galaxy ones.\n\nI got these at a local farmers market and I can only hope that I'll be able to get them next year too. Wish they were more available in big box stores and bigger nurseries.\n\nI collected seeds just to be safe but who knows if it will be a success or not.\n\nWhere did you find these? Did you grow them from seed? Never see such unique varieties at nurseries! Stunning!\n\nAt my local farmers market! I haven't seen them in big box stores or local nurseries yet, so I can only hope that I will find them next year too. I was thinking of looking the seeds up online, just in case\n\nThe purple ones make me think of space. So stunning.\n\nThose are amazing!\n\nMy deep purple one turned snowy white; my black ones became lemon yellow.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xruh00vmq81e1.jpeg?width=2882&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=534c42eaad2f6530c721d37b2f8ceedb64d5989a\n\nOmg they are gorgeous!!! Love them!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ug3h0lt7r81e1.jpeg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb6788152399973acba75a3983a2e59afdd2e2d2\n\nBlack petunias turned yellow. What fun!\n\nBeautiful! It's so cool that they turned yellow, I was expecting them to turn white too haha\n\nThe first one and the black one are literally insane. I had a red and white petunia and they seem bland compared to yours. Same with hibiscus. The strains/hybrids I am seeing after going to enough nurseries is unbelievable.\n\nAw I love the red and white ones!!! I had one too but it didn't make it till the end of the season, I also had a similar pink and white one, I suspect that I overwatered them in their hanging planters. Guess I can't be trusted with those planters haha\n\nIt is unbelievable! It feels like every time I open this app, there's a new color, a new variety, a new variegation, a new something... it's really cool but it's kind of scary at the same time how they keep us hooked with all the shiny new stuff they keep pushing out.\n\nAh, RNA interference was discovered in petunias. Got a Nobel recently!!\n\nTbh I had to google it and pretty sure I only understand the half of it haha but how cool is that! Thank you for mentioning it!!!\n\nI'm sorry, I should've linked some resources. I just had to mention that they're very cool flowers colour-wise and even ended up aiding biology's advancement :)\n\nHere's a great video explaining the basis and the mechanism in a (I find) easy-to-understand way: [link](https://youtu.be/Vh3-NHdjnyQ?si=GQdTQ0wDsDfaVB1d). And here's an image of some of the cool petunias the first researchers created: [link](https://www.nature.com/articles/451414a/figures/1).\n\nAw you're so awesome, thank you so much!!! :) it's so interesting!\n\nI'm glad you enjoyed it :D\n\nDid the fairies stop by? Haha. Magical lil blooms!\n\nHaha I am not sure about fairies but hummingbird moths did show up and went crazy for them! :)\n\n[removed]\n\nIt is! :) They are so pretty\n\n[removed]\n\nThey sure do! Summer ended with terrible heatwaves here and interestingly, some of them lost their pattern and had mostly solid purple/pink colored flowers. I pruned them back and as the weather started to cool down, the new set of flowers had the pattern again!\n\nThey look so magical!!❤️\n\nWow.. prettiest flowers I've ever seen\n\nGalactic. Amazing 😍\n\nSo pretty!\n\nWow! How beautiful 😍\n\nWoah those are nice!\n\nDreamed ❤️\n\nWow!! 😍\n\nI had #11 this summer and mine turned almost entirely white at some point too. That cultivar smells really nice though, I loved it!\n\nThat's so interesting! Mine lost that light colored border around the edge almost completely and turned mostly red :) it really did smell nice!\n\nAwesome💜💜💜💜\n\nYou're reminding me I should look for petunias next summer. I had the starry ones a few years ago, and had forgotten they were this gorgeous.\n\nAwesome! I love them, I am planning to get them next year too! :)\n\nPetunias? I thought we were entering light speed.\n\nLol that's a good one! 😄 those colors are insane, aren't they :)\n\n𝔹𝕖𝕒𝕦𝕥𝕚𝕗𝕦𝕝\n\nHitting warp speed, Captain!\n\n😄😄😄\n\nI had the same galaxy petunias this year! They are stunning and I can’t wait for them again next year.\n\nMe too, I hope I will be able to find them next year too!\n\nI haven’t come across these beauties where I’m at, but looking at your post I’m definitely going to hunt for em. They’re gorgeous.\n\nEdit : fixed a typo\n\nYou def should try to get them if you can, I am so pleased with them, sure you'll love them too! I will be trying to get them again next spring too (found them at my local farmers market this year)\n\nI got one for 2.99 $ at 99 cent store last year.\n\nI’m sorry. What?! There are black ones?! I neeeed it. 🖤🖤\n\nThere are!!!! Technically I guess they are very dark purple but they do look like black velvet! I fell in love with them instantly!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tw8p2bb4t61e1.jpeg?width=2250&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0b8dd8c6bca20516787651a26a2abf54d38a4406\n\nI found black pansies too!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gufgc22it61e1.jpeg?width=2250&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b4a0b2b4269713580aa93cb1366ad8d13f58fa52\n\nI use to have those at my old place. I miss them.\n\nI just discovered the beautiful world of black flowers so they were new to me, and I am overly excited about them (can you tell) :) \n\nAw I hope you'll get the chance to grow them again!\n\nI love petunias. I recognize almost all of them except the red and yellow dotted one with yellow trimmed petals. Which is that?\n\nAnd is the maroon one _burgundy velour_? Love that one.\n\nAw I love them too! :)\n\nSadly I don't know the names of any of them, I got them at the farmers market and none of them had a tag.\n\nGoogled burgundy velour and it does look a lot like mine!\n\nAh, gotcha. They are frequently called \"starry night\" or \"galaxy\" petunias. They are patented and propagated entirely through clones/cuttings, since these hybrid varieties do not produce viable seeds.\n\nDo _not_ believe Amazon and shadier seed sellers with these varieties.\n\nThe star shaped ones actually _can_ grow from seed, they are called \"star\" petunias.\n\nOh that's so cool! I am really really new to petunias (can you tell haha), they are fascinating! Thank you so much! :) Can't believe how perfect these names are haha\n\nWow those are really pretty 🤩 nature is amazing\n\nIt is! :)\n\nGlorious flowers!!\n\nHow do petunia seeds work? Do the flowers from a plant grown from a seed of a black petunia for example always come out black or does it matter what it got pollinated by?\n\nWhere do you get the galaxy plans from? I was not able to find starts anywhere.\n\nI got all of these as starter plants from my local farmers market, so I don't really know anything about seeds :)\n\nSomebody just warned me that the seeds of the galaxy ones are not viable and I am not 100% sure, but I think somebody else said the same thing about the black ones too. The rest should be fine. However, I already collected seeds from most of them haha I'll report back in the spring :)\n\nMy very limited understanding is - as you mentioned - that cross-pollination may happen and the ones grown from seeds could be a different color, which I think is very cool :)\n\nThese are all stunning\n\nI think this just convinced me to plant petunias next year. So pretty!\n\nIf you like them, you totally should! :) I had some trouble with aphids but it wasn't too hard to handle, and other than that and some regular pruning, they didn't require much to be happy and bloom all summer long.\n\nYour petunias look absolutely beautiful! I had some galaxy ones a few years ago but didn't see any at all this year at the nurseries or big box stores. Hopefully I can find some next year.\n\nThis was the first year I found them (at my local farmers market of all places), never seen them before. Someone in the comments mentioned that they sell them every year, these just sell out so fast I probably never had the chance to find them. We need to keep an eye out next year! :)\n\nAh that must be it! I can definitely see them selling out fast! Will certainly keep an eye out earlier on next year ❤️\n\nCan I steal them🥹\n\nGorgeous!!!\n\nIt went supernova\n\nIt sure did lol\n\nI almost thought I was looking through the galaxy\n\nIt's so mesmerizing, isn't it :)\n\nFor sure it is!\n\nOMG those are all gorgeous! I adore the night sky ones and black ones!\n\nThose are my favorites too! :)\n\nSo pretty🌸\n\nBeautiful flowers!\n\n[deleted]\n\nHaha it does look like that!!!\n\n[removed]\n\nIt's so cool! Thank you for letting me know! :)\n\nTemprerature changes\n\nThank you! :)\n\nWow. It’s like a purple starry night. Beautiful\n\nThe black ones are stunning 😍\n\nI'd love some of these seeds\n\nKind people in the comments warned me that the seeds of the galaxy ones are sadly not viable! :(\n\nI had the same purple galaxy petunias this year. They were incredible\n\nTbh I expected them not to be as vigorous or healthy as the regular ones but they grew even better than those! I am amazed haha\n\nu/FriendshipOk5089\n\nThose galaxy ones don’t look real! 😍\n\nWow, it feels like I just got sucked into outer space by looking into those!\n\nI thought I hated petunias... Turns out I just hate the basic ones 😂🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩 Absolutely gorgeous! I'll snag some of these galaxy ones next year if I can!\n\nLol it was the black one for me that changed everything I thought before haha\n\nI can't find black ones for the life of me!! I learned about them last year 😭 I had basically given up. This may have renewed my hope!\n\nI'll be so upset if I won't be able to find them next year lol let's hope both of us will get lucky next spring!\n\nIt's a riot of color - number 4 looks almost like a morning glory, and I've never seen anything like the color on number 11 before.\n\nWOW!!!😍 They're all so pretty!!🌸"

Congratulations.\n\nYou mean *amaizing*\n\nHaha I love that!\n\nNice one!!\n\n[Grown Ups - Maize](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCtrRWinq9Q)\n\nI was just going to go MAIZE in that voice he does but then I realize y'all can't hear me lol.\n\nI would have :)\n\nMAIZE\n\nShamelessly stealing this to tell my corn loving friends\n\nI was thinking of all the squirrel carcasses she must have nailed to her fence as a warning.\n\nThis is so unbelievably accurate\n\nI've grown a lot of corn.  I've eaten very little of it, LOL!\n\nI grew corn fat nasty disgusting greedy squirrels ate my harvest\n\nGrey or red squirrels?\n\nWhat, no smut?! Just kidding, these look amazing\n\nI want to try it so bad\n\nThey’re beautiful! Homegrown corn hits different :)\nETA: My late grandfather was a gentleman’s farmer and he used to grow it\n\nThats awesome!  I 25(F) never had anyone in my family garden or be very nature based at all. I taught myself how to fish and also garden so this means alot to me!\n\nThen you should be so incredibly proud of yourself! Hell, I’m super proud of you! Getting such a healthy &amp; well-pollinated crop can be tricky for experienced gardeners, much less someone who is self-taught. Well done &amp; enjoy the fruits (or veg/grains?) of your labor\n\nThank you !(:\n\nI saw  in my head you holding ears in each hand over your head and a yelling echo “I Have The Power!”\n\nI grew up eating homegrown bi-colored sweet corn. It's magical.\n\nIT’S CORN!!!\n\nA big lump with knobs!\n\nIt’s got the juice!\n\n*It has the juice!*\n\nFingers crossed mine will look as good as yours do. I have approximately 13 stalks (first time corn grower also). It’s so exciting to see them grow. So how many did you grow and how do they taste? Congrats!\n\nThank you! I'm sure with they will come out great! \nI have 8 stalks, only had these 3 ready but I have more coming soon! I froze them as I plan on making a veggie soup with some of the other veggies I have in the garden that need another week or so to harvest (:\n\nGood plan. I’m sure it will be delicious!\n\nI'm disappointed with mine. Also my first time. My stalks aren't very hearty and the corn is mushy. But the growing process is FACINATING!\n\nHomegrown always tastes better than store bought.  What variety is it if I may ask?  If you like sweet corn you might try Silver Queen next time.\n\nGood job!\n\nA miracle lol— they’re perfect 🥳🌽\n\nAnd well germinated too!  Congratulations!\n\nLow key jealous because I can't grow anything but herbs and flowes\n\nhey you’re doing better than me! Can’t grow herbs to save my life\n\nYou tell me you secret right now! Growing edible corn has eluded me for years now. 😒\n\nThis is my first time. Very mushy.\n\nGreat kid! Don’t get cobby!\n\nDamn that's some nice looking corn OP. Congrats. And if you find a caterpillar in one of the ears, just pick it out and wash off the corn and it will be fine to eat.\n\nOK now show us the rat bites\n\nI could never grow corn. It would be almost ready so I would wait a day or two for the silts to brown, but those damn squirrels always beat me to harvest. Lol\n\nCorngratulations 🌽\n\nLooks good congrats!!!\n\nThank you!\n\nCongrats!🎉\n\nIt’s beautiful! Congratulations!\n\nNicely done. Congratulations, you’re officially a garden nerd like the rest of us\n\nThose look great! Congrats. Corn is one that I have not done well with.....yet! Those will taste better than any corn you would get anywhere. Something about when you grew it. Good job.\n\nWe always knew you had it in you.\n\nyou did it :) the apex of gardening.\n\nBeautiful corn!\n\nLooks good- well done.\n\nCongratulations\n\nnow it’s summer! yum\n\nNice\n\nTasty\n\nLike my buddy's dad used to say, \"you plant corn, you get corn.\"\n\nLooks amazing\n\nGreat go of it\n\nWas it hard? Do you need alot of space for it or can you just grow a few stalks?\n\nNot hard it just takes time, I didn't use much space but then again I only grew about 8 stalks.\n\nFantastic job!\n\nMy experience with corn is that either it all dies or you have way more corn than you can eat. Grats on your harvest!\n\nincredible good work\n\nCorn!!\n\nNothing like organic!!\n\nPorumb😃🤤\n\ncorngratulations\n\nCongratulations it looks so yummy.\n\nLuckyyyy, I just grew corn stalks this year, lol.\n\nYay!!!!\n\nCongratulations!!

My corn did not fair well. Partially seems didnt pollinate well but also think the earwigs didnt help \n*\n\nThe raccoons seemed to really enjoy mine this year.\n\nBeautiful ears of corn I planted mine too densely this year, I tried a bigger bed so I can have more plants and planted too many seeds. last year was my best year for corn.\n\nCongrats! It's best fresh and that's as fresh as you can get. Anything that hasn't been picked the same day I eat it tastes like cardboard to me\n\nIt's a big lump with knobs.\n\nA corn break will restore your energy."

Preferably at the beach.\"\n\nr/AbsoluteUnits\n\nI have questions\n\nI'm very uncomfortable. How did this....happen? How much time?\n\nIt requires a sacrifice.\n\nCitrons take 3-5 years to produce fruit after planting.\n\nI think they meant how long has that particular fruit been growing on the tree\n\nIt looks basically exactly like a citron, which is one of the ancestors of the lemon.\n\n\nSo, presumably what happened is someone either planted a citron seed and waited, or grafted a citron cutting onto some roots and waited. \n\nWait so my lemon tree is making (smaller, normal lemon sized, but ugly as fuck and bumpier) eldritch abominations and we assumed it was just because we didn’t take care of it. Is it this thing or?\n\nAlmost every fruit tree needs to be grafted: apples, peaches, plums, cherries, oranges, lemons, grapefruits, tangerines...\nIf you take a seed from a fruit and plant it there is a high possibility that you will wait a really long time for it to produce fruit and that fruit will probably look like some wild fruit and not the one from which you took that seed.\nI had a lemon tree that was growing in the pot on my balcony for 7 years and never produced a fruit. I planted lemon seed when I was maybe 10-12 years old.\n\nIt looks like my grandfather’s nose  lol .\n\nAlright, I’ve been thinking. When life gives you lemons, don’t make lemonade - make life take the lemons back! Get mad! I don’t want your damn lemons, what am I supposed to do with these? Demand to see life’s manager. Make life rue the day it thought it could give Cave Johnson lemons. Do you know who I am? I’m the man who’s gonna burn your house down! With the lemons.

    "all_comment_text": "You eating like a royal tonight!\n\nI grow mini broccoli because it gives a bunch of little crowns. Then you don’t lose all of it to a warm few days and you don’t need to wait for a big head to grow\n\nr/mightyharvest\n\nTry try again.  Broccoli can be so satisfying to grow.  It likes sun, food, and cool weather.  I like to buy the little starts because they seem to get that greenhouse boost.  I fertilize every two weeks and harvest after sixty days (both spring and fall).  Each plant will make a large head.  You are going to love growing broccoli.\n\nIs it too late to start now at beginning of November? Zone 7\n\nYeah, it's a bit late.  I'm in 6B and I usually plant the greenhouse starters in Mid-March for harvest the beginning of May.  And again in early September for harvest end of November.  If you want to try though, your local greenhouse may have some super overgrown ones that you could plunk in the ground.  They can get down to about 28 degrees happily.  It's worth a try.\n\nCelebrate ur achievement ✨️ next harvest shall be plenty. This was your training wheel 🙂\n\nCongrats! Homegrown broccoli is delicious.\n\nAbundance!\n\nLooks more like broccolini. Either way, it’s delish!\n\nI was going to say the same, the florets look more like broccolini than broccoli. The head of the broccolini has more slanted and longer ends, compared to broccoli where they’re smaller and rounder. The stem also matches as it’s longer and thinner. \n\nBroccolini is delish, I have a pack in my fridge right now!\n\nEven better!\n\nBoth are super yummy! I'm envious\n\nBest crudité award given\n\nI’ve never had any friggin luck with broccoli. Will never bother again.\n\nYour hands are massive!\n\nIt's cute.\n\nI could post my bug eaten scraggly plant that has not even started to form a head yet...or my zucchini plant that only has a dozen leaves and 3 small fruits, the largest only 3\"...or my cabbage that turned out to be a butternut squash. You've got me beat this year, but I'll get you the next. ;-)\n\nYour garden sounds like mine!\n\nRespectable gardening brócoli.\n\nIt may be small. But just you wait until NEXT fall when you will be sick of harvesting bowls of broccoli each week that need to be eaten or processed relatively quickly . Broccoli was my least promising and most surprising when it became productive\n\nCongratulations!  The wait is over!\n\nThis is more broccoli than I’ve ever managed to grow!\n\nA healthy sprig.\n\nThat is a stunning broccoli! My daughter and her grandma grew some carrots this year and they were the best carrots I've ever had in my life. So damn sweet! Build on your success! We are planning out a garden for next spring :)\n\nLooks like broccolini\n\nThat'll be one hearty bite.\n\nI bought started seedlings that were in the little 4 packs in early Sept and I'm just now seeing some coming in.  My garden doesn't really get enough sun this time of year so I think that's what is taking it so long.  Hope I get enough for Thxgvng.\n\nThank you for sharing!\n\nThat’s adorable\n\nYou got further than I did! Slugs destroyed nearly everything this year.\n\nMy broccoli grows the same way.  Not worth it.\n\nI mean that’s great, but where’s the rest of it?? You planning on feeding a gnome?\n\nI remember my first home grown broccoli a couple of years ago, was soo green and big, never had a broccoli as tasty before or after. Store stuff just does not compare. Wish i had a big field to grow a lot.\n\nIt's beautiful! 🥹\n\nLooks good for your first time\n\nMine died.\n\nThat looks like a quality broccoli.\n\nMonths and months growing. Eaten in 2 minutes.\n\nMake sure you also eat the leaves, you can use them like any other cabbage leaf\n\nSo rewarding 😍\n\nYou must be feeling wonderful!\n\nNo that’s a labor of love! Good job. Mine die in the heat, so  stopped trying to grow it. Looks like enough for a one person veggie starter😉\n\nAt least the cabbage moths didn't destroy it\n\nA bountiful harvest 🥦\n\n❤️\n\nThat could go with that other person's mom's Mighty Carrot and would make a Might Side Dish.\n\nHell yeah! Love hearing and seeing people grow veggies/fruit/etc. from seed! Keep up the good work and feel free to check out my lemon plant, from sprout(seeds) to 4 months old!\n\nlmao i love it so much 😍 the most delicious bite of broccoli you will ever taste.\n\nCongratulations!!!!!\nSeriously better than my try at it this year!!\n\nI’m surprised you got that since you planted in March. Broccoli is a winter crop planted in the fall. I’m surprised it didn’t bolt and die over the summer.\n\nWhat is this? Broccoli for ants?\n\nThat's me with my lemon tree. Lol wtg!\n\nTruly why gardening is my hobby and not my source of food. My broccoli turned out the same.\n\nNice!!! At least you got something, the woodchucks ate all mine last time!"

    "all_comment_text": "OMG.  That is awesome! \n\nNo really, I'm actually jealous.  It has a seed and everything!\n\nI'm actually kind of floored that it was able to produce a seed in such a small fruit. I wonder if it would produce a bunch of micro-watermelons if you grew it 🤔\n\nThat’s the question I’d like to know as well. If you get stunted fruit… does the stunted fruit seed grow the same way ?\n\nWell most likely no, because the fruit size could have been purely the cause of environmental factors, and as such there is no genetic component that can be passed down. Similar to how human height naturally increased with better nutrition, the seedling from this fruit can probably produce normal melons.\n\nBut there is a very very slim chance that this is the result of a genetic mutation, in which case the trait may be passed down, and with some selective inbreeding, you can eventually get a variety of waterberries.\n\nI'd spend a lot of money on waterberries\n\nThis exactly. There are melons tho specifically bred to be smaller. But not to this level. Where I live I commonly see very small watermelons at the store too. Often called ice box melons in English. But these are even a tad bit smaller. Like a large grape fruit. Can't remember trying them tho. I feel they're a bit overpriced.\n\nSo if someone is interested. It's probably a good idea to start obtaining those types of varieties and keep selecting small ones and create your own variety.\n\nI’ve had one or two and it’s literally just a smaller water melon identical in every way but size\n\nWould that not effectively be selecting for melons that are capable of growing such small fruit to maturity? It seems to me that if it can do so, where others can't under the same conditions, it must be at least partially genetic.\n\nWatermelons, like a lot of cultivated fruit, have been selectively bred to develop cultivars with much larger fruit than their wild ancestors. \n\nI know nothing about watermelons in particular, but for some plants propagation from seeds from wild pollination does tend to produce fruits with more \"wild\" characteristics (that is, smaller, usually less sweet). Apples are notorious for this; most apple seeds from uncontrolled pollination produce fruits which are progressively more like crabapples than dessert apples. \n\nSo what I'm saying is, depending on lots of factors, it might be possible that OP has ended up with a seed resulting in plants with smaller, wilder fruits.\n\nIf the cucurbits grow smaller from environmental factors then it epigenetically influences tbe seeds to grow smaller fruits next time even with perfect environment. \n\nYou need big seeds to grow big melons. \n\nBut this could be a mutation too. The vines from the stunted seed even if they don't carry the mutation would probably be impacted\n\n… it grew the fruit around the seed\n\ntry not to eat it all in one sitting\n\nYou mean try not to eat it all in one bite, as one has to savor their harvest!\n\nBehold\n\nMy Potato\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/36djuujqddgd1.jpeg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=31e41441fa52ac2d07ff359c756e3af8bbda891c\n\nThat looks like an old seed potato from last year that got forgotten\n\nIt has scab, a minor potato disease\n\nIt's okay, potatoes! You can have scabs!\n\nYou and OP need to share with r/mightyharvest lol\n\nThat'll make enough potato salad for this ant party I'm throwing. You should whip up a batch and bring it on over!\n\nIt reproduced - there's a seed. It succeeded. You, OP, grew a successful watermelon. Congratulations! \n\n(Not sarcasm; I've not got results this good yet.)\n\n[deleted]\n\nshe’s not lazy she’s doing her best😤\n\nr/mightyharvest\n\n❤️ this\n\nThe single seed hahah 🤣\n\nIt’s like a try again\n\nContinue the bloodline hahah\n\nLike buying a $1 scratchoff and winning $1 lol\n\nThat's how I will describe my cucumber harvest this year!\n\nNature is merciful\n\nIt (sometimes) only takes one seed!\n\nThe 2 nibbles of this fruit were quite sweet and tasty. It was some kind of ‘sugar summer watermelon’ that I grew from a seed packet, meant to grow a normal-sized melon. I saved the seed to try it next year, though!\n\nI planted the vine in a somewhat shaded spot with rocky soil &amp; compost, and all the other flowers were too close to the netting and got eaten up by deer. I harvested after the vine died off, didn’t expect it to actually be ripe!\n\n&gt;meant to grow a normal-sized melon. \n\nIts average!\n\nI looked at the seed packet. There’s no mention of the size I should expect, but the cultivar is called ‘Sugar Baby Watermelon.’ Maybe I’ve judged too harshly!\n\nShrinkflation is getting out of hand 🤣\n\nMan, that penny is HUGE.\n\nHonestly good job\n\nWhat is that a watermelon for ants?\n\nr/thingsforants\n\nWelp, you won't be needing a melon baller!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/secqfxopjegd1.jpeg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5c087c5344a0fbb0f0ce9c01771d382255c24b5f\n\ni did too\n\nDoll house breakfast!\n\nI just cackled out loud, it’s sooo cute!!!! Go you!\n\nCut it into proper little watermelon triangles to share.\n\nNow, do you have a banana for scale?\n\nr/mightyharvest\n\nOh, we *feasting* tonight\n\nBless your heart! Your watermelon growing skills are bad as my own. If I can ever get them to grow to any real size ... a rare occurrence, I ALWAYS pull them too early! LOL  But it can never be said I didn't give it one helluva good try! For YEARS I tried and, for the most part, failed. LOL There's always next year...\n\nYou will feed armies\n\nTeach me master!\n\nThis is going to be me in a week or so. Mine is exactly the same size 🤣\n\nNot seedless I see. 😂\n\nIf they sold these like cherry tomatoes, I'd give it a go!\n\nWe had a cantaloupe vine that once grew a fruit that was only slightly bigger.\n\nIt was *super* sweet, though.\n\nThat is the largest penny that I have ever seen...\n\n/r/mightyharvest\n\nKeep that seed for next year.\n\nNo watermelon will taste sweeter than the first one you've grown by yourself. I've harvested hundreds more than my first, but none of them are more rewarding than the first one. You should be very proud!\n\nCongratulations!\n\nYou did better than me! I have a watermelon plant. It looks nice. Never got any female flowers on it\n\nJuicy!!\n\nHow was it?\n\nWas it good\n\nLmfao I would actually save and grow that seed just to see if it would then start to produce “cherry watermelons”. If so, you could start a novelty fruit stand selling these. Or you could sell the rights to a nursery.\n\nCherry watermelons would take off omg especially if they are sweet\n\nr/thingsforants\n\na tiny watermelon to make a tiny Agua Fresca and watermelon rind bhaji\n\nIf this keeps happening you may have created a new type of tiny melons\n\noohh you can make watermelon juice I'll get the thimble.\n\nI grew some cucamelons this year just for fun. They taste like cucumbers\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4cjyj3wetfgd1.jpeg?width=2560&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a026f5348dd70972ab356fe014d1f4713d8e040e\n\nThat'll do pig. that'll do.\n\nYou are not fooling anyone with your fig.\n\nBite size is the latest thing now!  Good job!\n\nI bet you $5 I can fit an entire watermelon in my mouth.\n\nIt is adorable!\n\nHey, you even got a seed in there! Great job.\n\nI have never laughed so hard. This is amazing!\n\nEveryone starts somewhere.\n\nWow ! You can even save A seed.. I'm guessing you need better pollination.\n\nCongrats! This was also my first watermelon\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nnmoeq192kgd1.jpeg?width=2992&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b0d6a4049fad76d0e52e55f157a2cc76af4059c8\n\nAwww tute 🥰\n\nIs more like a water-grape 🤣 congrats\n\nAwwwww...\n\nThe watermelon gods have blessed you!\n\nDid it taste good? 😂\n\nThat would be considered _huge_ in the tiny food cooking world.  Good job!\n\nwtrmln\n\nThat's an impressive fig you have there!\n\nNice\n\nNow you have the seed to grow another one.\n\nLol!\n\nWhere did you get that huge penny?\n\nHow was the taste\n\nI have seen adds for grape sized watermelons, maybe a bit larger. This isn't one of those, is it? I'd sure like to have a report from someone who has actually grown those\n\nPortal\n\nDid you though lol\n\nCocktail watermelon\n\nGrowing prepackaged melon balls.  Amazing.\n\nI love this sub!  \n\nCongratulations. I hope you shared with the whole neighborhood.\n\nOne seed\n\nTHIS is exactly the reason I don't try growing fruits and veggies anymore. You spend $351.99 to grow the crap, stress over the shit for months and get 1 teeny tiny yield. Makes me crazy! Also, nice job. It may be tiny but thats one fine looking fruit. Enjoy your.... bite.\n\nIsh’ lol. Gotta start somewhere\n\nAnd even one seed! How'd it taste?\n\nSuccess!\n\nr/mightyharvest\n\nNgl that looks cute! I wish I could've grown one myself\n\nI\nAm \nSo\nProud\n\nI jelly too, it’s just a baby\n\nIt’s so cute hahaha\n\nCongratulations!\n\nCongrats! It's not much, but it's honest work :) Btw, happy [National Watermelon Day](https://digitalhygge.com/national-watermelon-day/)!!\n\nLETS GOOOOOOOO\n\nOne bite and it’s gone?\n\nr/mightyharvest\n\nWhat is this, a watermelon for ants?\n\nIf this was an open pollinated variety, you gotta grow out that seed and observe epigenetics at play.\n\nI'm assuming it was from a highly stressed plant, but it looks mature.\n\nMaybe you got the start of a new cultivar on your hands.\n\nCongratulations, it's beautiful, enjoy it!\n\nI have reported you to JD Vance as you have aborted a watermelon.\n\nI think this is my favorite watermelon I've ever seen.\n\nBarbie would be so proud\n\nThese would fast become a yummy garnish to cocktail glasses for sure!! \nHell, I'd order a bowl for snacks as well!\n\nIf you like that one, try MiniLove variety. Softball size. I had success with it but just not big enough for my boys.\n\nOh my god it’s so cute. Congratulations!\n\nThere’s even a seed!\n\nYou should post it in r/mightyharvest\n\nNew Artisan Micro Watermelons, perfect for pack lunches and on the go.\n\nYou don't even need a melon baller for that one.\n\nThe seed caught my eye right away.\n\nIf this is a mutation I’d love to see this stabilized and turned into a reproducible plant\n\nGood job!!!\n\nIt has a seed so you have many more to grow !!!!!\n\nLol. For the wee people.\n\nFOR ANTS?!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hhoipse7vhgd1.jpeg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=14e7c1c630d6057d9e7936128fd52a51cfc7ae59\n\nSame lol\n\n👏\n\nWatermeloncito\n\nThat penny is huge!\n\nAt least it's ripe\n\nPlease take care about the Amount you grow as you could easily get trouble with the IRS when you obviously grow amounts that could only make sense for someone who sells their Produce.\n\nImpressive!\n\nFun to see gardeners reveling in their disappointments. These are awesome\n\nCongrats! Small treasures\n\nThat was mine last year! 😅\n\nThis year I have one the size of a softball and I'm so thrilled!\n\nGood job!\n\nI am so freaking jealous of you. I thought i would have one and then the summer destroyed all my hopes and dreams.\n\nWoohoo, congrats!\n\nCongrats! I got so excited last year I grew a cantaloupe that size, but some critter ate its insides! I know what kind of work it can take to grow something. So be excited! It's cool!!\n\n👏🏾\n\nSize unclear, please take a photo of it with a banana.\n\n😂 I planted mine a month late and am expecting something like this.. How’d it taste?? Lol\n\nShe’s a beauty. Well done! 🍉\n\nThe power of Lincoln...\n\nThis made me guffaw &amp; I'm utterly charmed by it. \n\nSave the seed! Let's see what happens next year.\n\nAbe would be proud and would send that pit a half a mile\n\nYum! Would make a nice pitcher of watermelon margarita\n\nEat it with chilis\n\nThat’s so tiny and precious!!\n\nThe one seed !\n\nA Wittlemellon\n\nLife, uh, finds a way. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e6qm0omwqkgd1.jpeg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5b6363277d079163226eb9cc18497aaf4b98945f\n\nI picked one today too!

    "all_comment_text": "[removed]\n\nI mean you sneeze and tomatoes grow. My garden is 120ft from my house and I had a cherry tomato popup right next to the house and it's a variety I planted last year but not this year. I also had 2 additional plants popup that I let grow that I never planted.\n\nI can confirm that this is true. They grow everywhere, lol\n\nLiterally lol. Someone told me growing them in the same place as last year would provide less and smaller tomato... Well third year in a row there are tomato plants nearly 3 meters tall, with a lot of delicious, big tomatoes. They are growing on the roof of a shed that the plants climb to lmao\n\nCries in Colorado. They do not grow well everywhere. They will grow, but not great.\n\nSouth Carolina cries with you, has gotten too damned hot.\n\nGrowing good here in Aurora. Like weeds! \n\nSee I’m super jealous because I suffered with early blight and leaf footed bugs all year and got very few tomatoes. I got to harvest less than 25% of the tomatoes from my plants this year. I got so frustrated I ripped them all out. Now the leaf footed bugs and assassin nymphs are getting my peppers.\n\nI had one pop up from where schmoo ran out on the ground from a sewer backup and subsequent clean out. Sweetest little yellow pear cherry tomatoes I have ever encountered.  I called them poo-maters.\n\nYou eat these poomatoes?\n\nWell won't you look at Mister Green Thumb here!\n\n(Jk, I'm just jealous, gardening in central Europe is such a hit or miss)\n\n“Give me all of the mozzarella and basil you have”\n\nHold on, I’m worried you might have heard “bring me a lot of mozzarella and basil.” What I said was, “give me all of the mozzarella and basil you have.”\n\nall I need is a box of kosher salt\n\nSix loaves of sourdough, a toaster and a whole fucking lot of kewpie mayo\n\nWhy kewpie mayo?\n\nIt’s richer. I believe they only use egg yolks instead of whole eggs. Also, squeeze bottle mayo beats the jar by a mile in terms of delivery method.\n\ntbh, the real reason is my local Costco has it by the two pack in a reasonable quantity. Best Foods comes in fucking gallon tubs, and that’s just gross.\n\nI’ll have to give it a try. In my locale, Best Foods is way overpriced and not that great. Maybe the “olive oil” version isn’t so bad? Meh.\n\nAfter walking out and seeing that the deer ate all my tomatoes for the third year trying, this hurts on a very deep level.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uyhsevgpegnd1.jpeg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=83b5b5c232e3f7db9abb7e94d72b4327f8a81515\n\nMe too. Cleaned the plants twice this year down to nubs. I found the farmer’s market nearby instead. Much less cursing at home now!\n\none of our neighbors built this fully enclosed garden to keep the deer out. He did it relatively cheap too. A couple 2x4x12 on each corner and some 2x2s to square it up. Netted the whole thing even the top to also keep birds out. Added a door and it’s a walk in garden.\n\nWould love to do that just don’t have the room in my backyard.  It’s a bizarre landscape.  My little 3x3 garden is the best I’ve got.  Next year I’ll figure out what to do with it so they won’t eat my garden. \n\nTruth be told though.  It’s ok.  The deer needed them more than I do and they were here first. Just frustrated because I wanted to have one successful year.\n\nMaybe just try putting them in a pot instead so you can move them closer to the house? Sometimes I’ve noticed our deer won’t eat anything too close to the house. Just a thought. Good luck!\n\nThought that too, but the buttheads ate the leaves off my jalapeño plants.  Have a video from my door camera of one chomping away on it while I was out grocery shopping.  \n\nOne of the younger last night “tried” a jalapeno for their first time.  Obviously wasn’t into spicy food.  😀\n\nHave you tried liquid fence? It smells awful but it works pretty well for me. I use the granular version (I know kinda confusing bc it’s called liquid fence) bc it lasts better through a rain\n\nI’ve heard of it, just never gave it much thought… until now though.\n\nIt’s worth a shot! It really does smell horrible though just a fair warning 😂 I think it’s like synthetic wolf pee scent\n\nCan it be any worse than the fish emulsion I use to fertilize my garden?\n\nDepends on how you feel about ammonia 😂\n\nI’d like to see that video. 😁\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/gardening/s/wn5hGZY4Si\n\nI really want to enclose my garden to keep squirrels out, but I'm worried about keeping birds out, they do so much pest control.  Maybe just the type of birds in my area, they never seem to damage my crops, but I see them out every evening picking bugs off everything.  Has anybody here enclosed their garden and then found insects got worse?\n\nStarted to see deer hoof prints and nibbles on my tomatoes this year. Carnivore urine kept them from coming back after one application. \n\nGross but effective. Either find a willing man or male child to use a corner of the garden bed once or twice, or take your dogs there on a walk.\n\nWell, my wife says that I’m like a child.  And I am willing, so… double-whammy!\n\nJust thought of this but this is similar to when I would go backpacking with my dog and we would pee around our campsite to keep the other animals away.\n\nTake heart. Venison is a delicious alternative to tomatoes.\n\nOMG!!! 🤣 That is the worst and best response I’ve seen.\n\nHunters say that if the deer smell human urine and stay away so I’m guessing it might do the same if it was around the edges of the garden too.it might work\n\nI feel your pain. 😣\n\nThe rats 🐀 got ours this year 😡☹️\n\nI've had to set up wire metal fence around all my precious crops. So many plants destroyed before that. I hope the deers are satisfied, or that maybe a hunter will be satisfied.\n\nThe deer ate my the top parts of my pepper plant, tomato plant, and raspberry plant that I left on the porch. Now I put everything inside an area enclosed with plastic mesh/deer fencing.\n\nFurthermore, are your tomato vines growing out from under or supported by a pine tree/evergreen shrub?\n\nSo lovely. So many! Many tomato sauce jars.\n\nSalsa! Whoop whoop!!\n\nNever too many. Find a good sauce recipe and have fresh tomato sauce all winter. Freeze and thaw when needed\n\nTomato pie oh my!!!\n\nUnderrated dish, and so rich and satisfying. I added some blue cheese - heaven\n\nCanning jars at the ready?\n\nGazpachooooooooo\n\nOooo. New idea for me. Never made it I’m going to now! Thanks!\n\nThis is an easy but delicious recipe (don’t skip the straining step): https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017577-best-gazpacho\n\nThank you! Unfortunately NYT won't show me the recipe bc I'm no longer a subscriber. But I will find something similar to the description. Cheers!\n\n [Picture](https://imgur.com/U5ZFsLX). Here you go, I've made this several times and have strained and not strained the soup. Both are delicious, but straining is so worth the effort.\n\nThank you so much!! 🍵\n\nHere's my best recipe if you are interested!\n\nSpaghetti sauce and Meatballs recipe:\n\nSauce:\n\n1 med onion\n\n10 cloves garlic\n\n7 cups tomatoes chopped\n\n2 bay leaves\n\nsalt and pepper\n\nCook until done, then freeze in meal sized packages. You want to simmer away some of the water so the sauce is thickened. I make mine in large, 35 cups-of-tomatoes batches.\n\nMEATBALLS (amazing):\n\n1 pound ground beef\n\n1 pound sweet Italian pork sausage\n\n3 slices white bread, torn/chopped\n\n2/3 cup water \n\n2/3 cup grated parmesan cheese\n\n7 cloves garlic, minced\n\n1 tsp salt\n\n1 tsp pepper\n\n1 large egg\n\nPut non-meat ingredients into a bowl or food processor to blend, then add to meat, mix thoroughly. You can make meatballs by dredging in flour and frying in olive oil, but this is stinky and messy, and very time consuming. The easy way is to spread 3/4 inch thick on a pan (with sides to catch the grease!) and bake at 350 F for 20-30 minutes. Cut into squares, and freeze in meal-sized amounts.\n\nNot OP, but taking note of your recipe. Looks good!\n\nIt's easy, too! I use a food processor to grind the tomatoes and garlic. I process over 100 lbs. of tomatoes each September for freezer spaghetti sauce with meatballs. \n\nI've already doubled the garlic but feel free to increase it some more. :)\n\nHow many plants is this?\n\nAround 60\n\nYou are crazy. I have 4 cherry tomato and 4 regular tomato and I don't know what to do with them. My entire basement fridge is full of them and another drawer in my main fridge. I can't imagine having 7x what I have now.\n\nI bet your neighbours love you!\n\nDo they all taste different?\n\nFor sure! Some quite sweet, some more acidic, some less taste. All sorts\n\nNever!  Sun dried tomatoes, oven roasted tomatoes, tomato and passionfruit jam, passata, tomato sauce, tomato soup, tomato salsa, tomato tart, tomato relish, the possibilities are endless....\n\nOooo… Sun dried tomatoes.. I should’ve done this\n\nPossibly still can depending on where you live, otherwise slow roast in the oven -  drizzle with olive oil, garlic powder (optional), herbs, S&amp;P, etc to suit your taste buds, then in the oven, preheated 125-150°C for 1.5 to 4hrs.\n\nCongratulations! These would make the most beautiful tomato galette. Enjoy!\n\nI wish I was your neighbor! Yum, I bet they taste delicious!\n\nThat looks like an amazing bounty!\n\nBeautiful variety of colors!\n\nNo such thing. Congratulations.\n\nYou'll be the Forrest Gump of tomatoes lol. Tomato soup, tomato sauce, caprese salad, tomato pie 😆\n\nNo such thing!\n\nIt's sauce time, babe!\n\nHow much land did you need for these to grow because I want to be like you when I grow up\n\nMy neighbors are beginning to tell me enpugh tomatoes and squash lol.\n\nThank you but NO MORE! Please. LOL\n\nMake sauce, use a food mill to make the process easier, then also afterwards dehydrate and powder the skins and seeds as well.\n\ni’m hoping heaven is filled with this many tomatoes\n\nI’ve done that several times. It’s usually worse than my zucchini problem. \nGotta have a lot of friends. And fresh bread for using those beautiful slicer tomatoes for sandwiches\n\nSauce and Salsa time!\n\nTaste the rainbow!\nGood job, your work made this beautiful and tasty wonder.\n\nOh my, you better get busy because tomorrow there will be more tomatoes raining down on you.....\n\nI am loving all of the colors 😍\n\nHope you have friends that like tomatoes\n\nsalad, jam, soup, sauces, plenty to do with them\n\namazing 😍😍 this is what I live for thank you for sharing this\n\nNice! Bring's back memories of Dad taking over the basement with ripening tomatoes. Eat them, can them, share with neighbours.\n\nOh yeah, that's a ton of bruschetta. BRING OUT THE BAGUETTES!!\n\nThere are never too many home grown tomatoes. We have 4 that are delivering such flavor. Our friends receive bags of them to enjoy as we do.\n\nMany varieties? Which ones are sweeter like candy? Do you do seeding? \n\nGorgeous!\n\nI do seeding. Too many varieties to name. The sweetest ones are the orange/mango/blood tomatoes! Seriously they are sweeter!\n\nMarmalade, dried tomatoes and jams!\n\nNo such thing as too many!\n\nGet busy with the canning\n\ndamn! i'm allergic... getting hives just looking at your beautiful haul there.\n\nThat's insane! Amazing! I hope you LIKE tomatoes 😂\n\nNever enough\n\nAnd here I was thinking I was doing good with my 3 tomato harvest.\n\nWow look at that colors\n\nAmazing!!!\n\nYou should can some! I am trying to learn now\n\nSuch a beautiful harvest\n\nMake sauce!\n\nThere’s never enough tomatoes!\n\nI hear ya, spent the day blanching, peeling, coring, packing . . . and we don't have nearly that many! And there'll be more next week.\n\nAwesome job!\n\nI want this kind of problem\n\nKetchup, please make some ketchup.\n\nHere's a tip I didn't see yet...(granted I haven't read them all)...\n\nFind the perfect unblemished ones, wash them, and put them into a freezer bag WHOLE. Yup. No peeling, no boiling, no cooking. Just wash and freeze.\n\nWhen you need tomato paste or you want to make a marinara or a tomato soup in the winter, take any number of frozen whole tomatoes and put them in a bowl of hot TAP WATER. Yes, water the temperature you use to wash dishes. \n\nPS; edited to ask...what are those deep purple ones in the middle bowl?\n\nIn less than a minute, they will all peel for you. Just use a melon baller or a paring knife to remove the navel, and you've got summer taste for your winter dishes.\n\nThat’s a good problem to have.  Get your canner out. \n\nSauce \n\nPizza sauce. \n\nTomato paste\n\nSalsa\n\nEnchilada sauce \n\nBruschetta \n\nPico de gallo\n\nPanzanella \n\nBLT\n\nGrilled cheese with tomato\n\nOh man wish I had that problem, not sure what I am doing wrong but for the past couple of years I barely get any. And yes I have rotated the crop I have added a bunch of minerals to the soil to be honest I am about ready to give up\n\nI should send you some basil. I planted a little bit from a seed packet in one space. They came up below knee height. We did a wild flower seed mix dump of a lot of seed in one other corner of the house and basil came up and went crazy tall up to just below my shoulder. I could hide behind the basil. There was also some gigantic sunflowers in that mix. I'm loving that space as the bees, wasps, and humming birds are always visiting.\n\nYou got tomatoes, I got fresh sourdough, olive oil, s&amp;p. Let's make this sandwich happen many times\n\nHahaha lets do it!!\n\nGorgeous!  Me thinks you either have 15 children.., or you planted too many tomatoes plants?!\n\nSo you’re saying you’re ready to give out? I’ll be over by 6!\n\nMaybe I missed it, but what are you planning on doing with the tomatoes?\n\nOh yummy\n\nOmg this is heaven!\n\nMail me some\n\nSalsa anyone?\n\nI am so jealous right now. Mine are taking forever to ripen\n\nWow! Time to make salsa for all your friends.\n\nI love it, I have only one green one this year, my tomato crop sucked.\n\nI’ve got excellent canning recipes for salsa, pizza sauce and marinara if you need them!\n\nSo much salsa?\n\nDamn, now I want some!\n\nSalsa time!\n\nWhat a lovely problem to have! I am so jealous lol\n\nfreeze them!\n\nIt takes me about a week to gather that many tomatoes, 2 beds that are 3' x 6'.\n\nHope you have a lifetime supply of Mason jars, lids, rings, and a few recipes lined up.\n\nYou and [this guy](https://www.reddit.com/r/homestead/s/fDS8hez8jF) should talk\n\nThat’s got food bank written all over it. They’re gonna love you!\n\nI have intense tomato envy!\n\nWhere do you grow?\n\nSouthern Ontario, Canada\n\nAnd i thought my tomato harvest was good! Lol\n\nJesus you must measure your garden in acres\n\nHello \nMake tomato jam !\nEat it warm on a Ritz crackers  omg so yummy ..\n\nNonsense.\n\nWow! What a problem to have!\n\nI grow about 400 lbs of tomatoes every year. I'm trying to clean out the deep freeze of all the tomatoes from last year this year too. I am so tired of canning.\n\nCue’s [**”(I Just) Died In Your Arms” - Cutting Crew**](https://open.spotify.com/track/4ByEFOBuLXpCqvO1kw8Wdm?si=0G2He7RVSneKg5UxFGiUkg)\n\n😍😍😍😍😍\n\nThere is no such thing as too many tomatoes\n\nNever too many\n\nYou know how to can tomatoes?\n\nFreezer tomato sauce and sun dried tomatoes in a vat of oil.\n\nMost beautiful thing I’ve seen today\n\nNot enough IMO. I used to make sauces and freeze em.  Now I just freeze em whole in large bags and use as needed.  1 whole deep freeze with just tomatoes in it.\n\nHave you tried fried green tomatoes?\n\nWow, this is glorious! Our roma tomatoes have been very sad this year, wish I had this result with them.\n\nDonate some to a food bank, it's really rare for them to get fresh fruit and veg in. \n\nThat's so cool though, good job!\n\nWow !!! Where do you live? I had such a hard time this year gardening because of the heat!\n\nSlow cooker into paste and sauce?\n\nI see this as I am watching a famous scene with tomatoes in The Godfather in the background lol 😆 🍅 🔫\n\nHere I am hoping mine ripen up before the cold weather splits them.\n\nI am SO jealous! There are some real beauties in this harvest\n\nSo much salsa!\n\nThis year has been the first time in my life my tomatoes have failed, I am so jealous lmao. I don’t even know *how* they failed, I’ve never, ever had a problem with them before.\n\nCan make tomato soup 🌱\n\nAt first glance i thought this was a table full of mixed fruit and veg! Nice variety of tomatoes you got!\n\nI want to be your friend. (In hopes you gift tomatoes)\n\nNever! Start canning! Get the ball canning guide\n\nOne can never have too many tomatoes. Make a fresh sauce or can some for later\n\nMake Salsa!\n\nNow let’s get cooking and stack that pantry\n\nNo such thing as too many. Dehydrate them and grind them into powder and use as a seasoning, make your own ketchup, ferment them, make enough pasta sauce to get you through winter... I love tomatoes\n\nSecrets in the sauce! Yum.\n\nToomatoes\n\nI had neighbors that grew tomatoes like this amount and they made tomato wine with them. 🍅 🍷\n\nWith all due respect, that sounds awful to me. A year’s supply of pasta sauce on the other hand…\n\nTomato soup !\n\nAll I can think about is the amazing pasta sauces you can make for friends and family (and of of course yourself)!!\n\nSauce time.\n\nNo such thing as Too Many Tomatoes. Pressure Can them and enjoy them over the winter.\n\nThis is how I imagine my harvest to be each year. Safe to say, its always dissapointing.\n\nNot a bad problem to have.\n\nOh my!  I just canned two batches of spaghetti sauce yesterday, and looking at these beautiful tomatoes makes me feel exhausted!!\n\nAs a representative of the southern hemisphere, I am deeply envious right now.\n\nNever too many tomatoes\n\nAfter years of successfully having this problem and spending weeks making salsa or bruschetta or freezing tomato sauce, for some reason this year my tomato plants never made it taller than 2 ft. They fruited and I didn't do anything differently than I typically do. \n\nAnyway congrats I'm just hoping the tomato fairy hears my bitching and lets me know what I did wrong. I suppose I purchased the plants rather than starting them from seed so maybe it's that\n\nOh my 😳🤤\n\nr/AccidentalRenaissance\n\nMake tomato soup and can it for the winter\n\nSauce and salsa. \n\nOr at my place we fire up the dehydrator.  A dash of salt and overnight on the dehydrator,  tomato chips are a great snack.\n\nI wish i had this problem instead of what happened to me. First, my ripe tomatoes got stolen and then a big storm almost ruined my plant while i was at work, then the new ripe ones got stolen again. Im sooo close to just giving up on growing the tomatoes. Its frustrating.\n\nTime to make and can tomato sauce, paste, and other tomato products.\n\nLots of salsa\n\nFinland: just a few small green ones and the weather will flip the kill switch soon.\n\nI wish I was your neighbor\n\nNo such thing lol\n\nCan, freeze and give away!"

She puts in a lot of work!\n\nMe too.\n\nWhat's the groundcover around the stones? It's gorgeous!\n\nI want to know this too! It looks like a variety of sedum, but what kind? The kind I’ve planted don’t seem to tolerate foot traffic well, so I’m always on the hunt for better options.\n\nIt looks super similar to my lemon ball stonecrop, so it could be that. They are supposed to be great ground cover, and if it is that plant they seem super hardy. Do recommend!\n\nI’ve tried stonecrop a few times, and they don’t seem to tolerate foot traffic at all. They get stepped on, that stem breaks off, rinse and repeat until the whole plant is dead. 😕\n\nFrom my mom:\n\n\"The ones in this photo are Sedum. There are many varieties and this is a low growing one. But I have some that are two feet high! Further up the path is a few other ground covers--the loveliest is the Scotch Moss.\"\n\nWell, please complement your mother for me! She has a beautiful garden. I’m impressed, she can clearly grow sedum better than I can.\n\nIt looks like angelina sedum to me!\n\nLooks like a good mix of sedums. Some places sell mats of mixed varieties you can cut into shapes. I adore sedum, but when it's in ground like this is gets so easily over-run with weeds. Gotta weed it like a hawk.\n\nThe tall thin yellow-flowered clover stuff really loves to hide in there\n\nLooks like a type of sedum to me\n\nLooks like a sedum mix. I see a few different varieties mixed in. I have something similar around my mail box and it can take a good amount of foot traffic\n\n[removed]\n\n😆\n\nSuch a beautiful path must make coming home even more enjoyable. I love it.\n\nOP, what has your mom planted around the stones - I am not familiar with it (I am in the southern hemisphere, it may not be typical here)\n\nIt looks like a variety of low growing sedums.\n\nThank you! They're stunning!!\n\n😅excellent! And so beautiful!\n\nOh, I see now it is stepping stones. I thought it was a snaking path! I was imagining package deliveries 😅\n\nThis path is the scenic route (*the more utilitarian route is on the other side of the house and is not nearly as pretty lol*)\n\nI love that there is a utilitarian route and a stop and smell the roses route. Super lovely.\n\nI was about to ask if this is the main path! I have a love/hate relationship with how American/modern houses have almost decorative front steps and doors that only visitors use. I am trying to think of a way to combine both when the main way we get into the house is through the garage half the time.\n\nThere's definitely ways to have a nice path that's beautiful *and* functional. This current house is on the corner so it can be accessed by two directions, but for places with only one way in (besides the garage lol) a simple concrete / brick path lined with plants is always effective!\n\nInspiration photo right there. It’s how I hope our path looks over the next few years as we figure out what can and cannot grow on our hill\n\nIt definitely took some time to get to this point! Hopefully you'll figure out a strategy 💪\n\nIt’s Mom here new to Reddit. Thanks to my son posting his photo and thanks for all the nice comments.  The sedum was from a one foot square mixed flat.\n\n😅\n\nWould you mind sharing what you started with and how long ago? Itts clearly a well established garden…this looks like a lifetime labor of love. My lime zinger sedum is about 3 years old around stone steps…but I it’s nowhere near that size!\n\nI designed and my husband and I started planting our property 8 years ago. It is a labor of love.\n\nIl in zone 7 as well! I have 5 more years for mine to look like yours! 😂\n\nAnd I started the sedum from a one foot square mixed flat from which I’ve also pulled up and planted elsewhere. I don’t know the specific cultivar. Maybe it just loves zone 7!\n\nSo damn beautiful, wow\n\nIf you sit there for more than five minutes, hobbits will come out of the undergrowth and offer you cake and Second Breakfasts. At least that's what it looks like.\n\nI do love a good second breakfast!! Unfortunately, that was a movie addition 😅 It's not in the book.\n\nWell it should have been. It's such a hobbit thing. Though actually, might just be a Took thing.\n\nWindows open for air\n\nThe side entrance. Not the formal entrance, or the one from the garage. And definitely not the servants' entrance  :D\n\n[deleted]\n\nOvercompensating online won't help you feel better about yourself\n\nmoss envy\n\nCan I live at your mom’s house? ;)\n\nYes, I love this.\n\nThis has east coast beach town written all over it! Hamptons maybe? Maine? Dreamy!\n\nNorth shore of Long Island!\n\nBeautiful!!!\n\nAbsolutely gorgeous! This is a dream!\n\nSaved as inspo!! Wow, so pretty\n\nSo nice to have a meandering path of beauty.  And a utilitarian path of efficiency 🍀\n\nIf that was my house, everytime I pulled up to the driveway or park in the garage, I would walk back to the street and follow the path to the front door. So lovely!\n\nExcellant, the ground cover is cedum that blooms a beautiful yellow.\n\nWhat are those plants around the step stones? ✨\n\nIt looks beautiful but I hate roses especially right beside a path, idk how many times I have caught my clothing or been nicked\n\nBeautiful !\n\n👌 how lovely!\n\nNice!\n\nLovely\n\nThe whole photo is dreamy!\n\nWhere would i find stones like those?\n\nLove it\n\nGoals!! So beautiful 😍\n\nLooks like the IRL Grandma's house in Kiki's Delivery Service\n\nSuch a classic ❤️\n\nThe Lombard garden 😋\n\nLike ways to heaven! So beautiful. a shout-out to your Mom.\n\nHow refreshing to see native flora being nurtured instead of perfectly manicured lawns that are of no help to the ecosystem!\n\nSuch a pristine garden. I love this!\n\nIt looks like a page out of better homes and gardens . I hope she gets featured one day is she hasn’t been already.\n\nSo beautiful 😍\n\nHow you created this???\n\nGoals.  When my kids get older and I can get rid of their soccer and lacrosse nets, this is what I want to do.  \n\nLooks like my dream home! How beautiful ❤️\n\nPOV you’re in photo mode playing Tiny Glade\n\nWhat are the dark pink flowers?  A type of rose?\n\nI’d never make it to the front door either 😁\n\nGlorious!\n\nWe miss you Jane Austen. You would've loved this path to her front door.\n\nSo lovely 🥰\n\nBeautiful\n\nMy very first thought.. Follow The Yellow Brick Road.... Amazing..\n\nAbsolutely breath taking.\n\nWonderful it’s the small things in life that can make u happy = priceless … can we see more of the garden?\n\nOne could trip on that and get hurt bad!\n\nIt pays to be mindful where you step!"

    "all_comment_text": "Can you eat that or is it more decorative?\n\nGlad someone else asked this 😂 my first thought too\n\nIt can be used as popcorn or ground into cornmeal, but it would be very unpleasant to try to eat fresh like sweet corn. \n\nSounds like it's time for some beautiful tortillas\n\nIt's perfectly edible and tastes the same as any other fresh corn, if picked at the milk stage. The ones in the photo are past that, and are dry.\n\nThese were actually fresh. Just taste tested them for the first time and they tasted great 👍\n\nThey look perhaps right at the cut off for fresh eating. Mine are similar but more on the pale side still. If I leave them for another 2 weeks, they will be the perfect glass gem for decorations, and popcorn . I love them.\n\nWhen do you recommend to harvest them for fresh eating? What is the sign I should be looking for?\n\nWait omg, they *can* be eaten like sweet corn if they're picked early enough?? My world has been changed. I want to eat some sooo badly now 😍\n\nThey look like jellybean stalks lol! Do they keep the colors if dried?\n\nI hope so! I’m planning on drying the next batch I harvest, so fingers crossed 👍\n\nMine did for the most part, became a bit more muted, but still very pretty.\n\nBeautiful!!\n\nThank you 🙏\n\nCongrats! Those are spectacular. What did you learn this first time around that you might change or keep next time you grow?\n\nThank you! \nHmm great question, 2 things I could think of. \n\nFirst is, I probably would have not planted my sweet corn directly next to my glass gem.. now my sweet corn is a hybrid breed between both due to the cross pollination.. 🤣  the second would be spacing out my crops more. I noticed the tallest, most product corn plants, were planted in area with the most sun . These crops were competing with the others for energy, so I do believe it hindered the other’s growth.\n\nCool thanks! I’ve always heard that it’s best to crowd them together to aid in pollination, but I guess it depends on the available solar exposure.\n\nThere are more than 200 different types of corn, and more than a thousand variations of tortillas can be created from them. I remember my cooking teacher once told me that.\n\nI enjoyed picking them, it was like opening presents cause you never knew what you were gonna get! \nMine were very small and stubby.\n\nHow many stalks did you grow to get such a variety of colors? They are so beautiful! I tried growing some this year, but mine only got partially pollinated.\n\nToo many! lol\nIn all seriousness, I think I planted the whole packet of glass gem seeds I bought (1/2 oz).\nI Didn’t space them out much, so maybe that has something to due with the large variety of colors? :)\n\nI’d love to see these made into popcorn. 😍\n\nWow, they are gorgeous!\n\nThey look fantastic! So cool !\nDid you grow these from seeds ? \nStupid question, will you be able to plant corn kernels from these next season, to further populate?\n\nYes I did! And surprisingly I started half indoors and transplanted them, which isn’t recommended.. lol, But it worked out great! \n\nYes if dried properly. I could plant these next season and repeat the process 😀\n\nI am growing this for popcorn I am sooooooo excited\n\nBeautiful\n\nWOW I didn't know they could come in so many colors!\n\nI think you mean first jelly bean harvest! They are so pretty! Love all of the colors!\n\nMine were all purple-blue, wonder if it has something to do with soil pH.\n\nWatching this gives me Candy Crush vibes.\n\nThis really does look like glass! Is it edible or poppable?\n\nWow thanks for sharing. I never knew they could grow like this. Ive only seen the yellow and purplish ones. Amazing !!!❤️❤️\n\nThat almost looks like jelly belly beans were used to make these pretty corns.\n\nThose are STUNNING\n\ni’m gonna show my nail tech this as my nail inspo\n\nbeautiful!!! 🤩🎨\n\nBeautiful 🤩🤩🤩\n\nIt's magical! Those colors! 😍\n\nI've never seen anything like that - they're beautiful!\n\nSo beautiful!\n\nThese are gorgeous! If you make popcorn is it just white popcorn with colored kernels?\n\nhow it taste?\n\nAs just the corn, not great.  You can pop it or grind it into cornmeal/flour for tortillas.  It's starchy, not sweet.\n\nClever idea!\n\nThey look beautiful but my stomach doesn’t want it. Anyone can tell me what causes these pigmentations? I can’t sense it’s a variety and then cross varieties between, but what causes pigmentation of fruits anyway and how can that be different for each seed like here? That’s so amazing, sorry too many questions.\n\nIt's caused by transposons, also called \"jumping genes\", which are able to jump to different positions within the genome. This is a natural phenomenon and also happens in humans, however the maize genome consists of a large number of transposons. The kernel colors are caused by pigments like anthocyanins (red, purple, blue), carotenoids (yellow, orange) and others. The synthesis of these pigments is encoded by specific genes. These can be disrupted by a transposon if it jumps into or near the gene sequence. (Example: gene encoding anthocyanins gets disrupted -&gt; kernel ends up being colorless or yellow-ish instead of red). \n\nNow.. why are whole kernels differing in color and not just single cells? Well, this is because each kernel is a individual seed and if a transposon disrupts a pigment gene early on in seed development, then the whole kernel will end up in a different color. It also can happen that the transposon jumps out of the pigment gene again in some cells of the seed later on in development. Then the kernel will end up spotted or bloched in color. \n\nHope this helped :) and please correct me if I'm wrong about something, I'm a plant scientist but it's been a while since I learned that. \n\nAdditional info: Barbara McClintock received the Nobel Price for the discovery of jumping genes in maize\n\nThis actually helps. Process of pigmentation is something really unknown to me (I’m from computer science) but  somehow I sensed the whole seeds being of same colour is due to the homogeneous growth of a seed from single type of gene expression. Thanks, huge help.\n\nDid you let it dry on the stalk? I'm not sure when to pick mine.\n\nI have always wondered how these are grown? Is it a special kind of corn? I know nothing about gardening, sorry. Very beautiful\n\nYes you just go online and buy glass Gem corn seeds and grow them like any other corn\n\nBut they aren't sweet. It's starchy more like animal feed corn\n\nThank you that’s very interesting, I never knew how they were made but always see them as fall decoration\n\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Pc_Gaming_Modificado.jpg\nGaming PC \n\nThey look sweet. Are they sweet?\n\nMe encantaria conseguir esas semillas\n\nFrom where we can get such seeds\n\nI Got mine from this company :\nhttps://www.highmowingseeds.com/organic-non-gmo-glass-gem-popcorn.html\n\nThanks a lot 🙏🏻\n\nThis was my first year growing glass gem and I was pretty happy with my small harvest. Yours looks glorious!\n\nWow😍\n\nSoo beautiful!!\n\nDo they taste like regular corn?  They are beautiful\n\nstunning\n\n10/10, beautiful\n\nWow! Gorgeous!\n\nHow does the popcorn made out of these look?\n\nI’m originally from Iowa, the Corn State, and we still own a family farm.  This is some beautiful corn.  Very nicely done!\n\nFellow Minnesotan here 👋 thank you I appreciate it!!\n\n[removed]\n\n100% eatable and organic 🙂"

Cause I am that guy\n\nMe too, and it has a small leak that I put on select needy plants.\n\nHell yea same I’m all about the poor man’s drip system\n\nThis is fucking hilarious\n\nAnd def leave the pressure on at the spigot. Out in the hot sun all day so your next shot out of the hose is 190F.\n\nThat's prime feet rinsing water right there\n\nI’m cackling 😂\n\nI have a successful vegetable garden for the first time in my life and I know it's only because I decided to leave that house laying out in the yard\n\nIt'd probably be more useful if you stood it up.\n\nYep. One giant loop. Never spooled, never tangled.\n\nSame. I've got two kids, who knows if I have the time to unspool and spool the hose. I'm gonna water and leave it out.\n\nI have (2) Suncast battery operated automatic wind hose winders. 100’ each. Greatest $179 per I’ve ever spent. Foot pedal and done.\n\nLinks or it didn’t happen.\n\nAt that point just get a giraffe tool hose or other similar brand. They’re self winding without the foot pedal. Have one and it’s incredible. Just pricey depending on the brand and length but our 150ft hose wasn’t much more than what they paid for a foot pedal one.\n\nAwesome! Thanks for this, Lowe’s has them.\n\nBSTOKCAM brand has a 100ft one for a real good price too. Amazon having a sale rn. I’ve used both and don’t notice much of a difference from the giraffe tool brand\n\nMy world just got rocked. I didn't even know this was a thing.\n\n[looks like home depot carries it](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Suncast-100-ft-Powerwind-Automatic-Rewind-Hose-Reel-CPLPW100/100076745)\n\nWe have one and it has been life changing.\n\nMy hose would be one giant kink\n\nThat’s what she said\n\n[deleted]\n\nI'm in the \"I only reel in my hose when I mow the grass\" camp. \n\nNow guess whether or not I make my bed after I get up every morning.\n\nI leave my hose out along the garden. Lining the edge. Saves me so much time every day.\n\nMy great aunt taught me this. Makes so much sense. I never get kinks and I save so much time.\nI should mention that none of my hoses had kinks until my husband decided to start coiling them. \nWe will never agree on hose care\n\nYep. I'd divorce over improper hose care 🤣🤣🤣\n\nTHIS IS ME!!!! So wonderful to learn there are others that even think about that shit. Hugs, new friends 😂\n\n&gt;I'm in the \"I only reel in my hose when I mow the grass\" camp. \n\nI'm in that camp too. Spooling and unspooling every time is more than my lazy butt can handle.\n\nYep. No shade to the hose-reelers but ain't nobody got time for that. Although, every now and then, one of my dogs manages to poop right on the hose.\n\nI have a hose rewinder and its crap. But i also feel like the hoses i buy are garbage. So maybe its my overall choice picks in things lol.\n\nGotta buy midgrade for yard stuff. The most expensive is a waste and the cheapest is garbage and doesn't usually last one summer.  I like to buy midgrade stuff on sale cause I'm cheap. You can usually get great deals end of summer, so prepare for the next year then instead of waiting for spring.\n\nI use ONLY pure rubber hoses. They don't kink and last forever. They can handle scalding hot or freezing cold temperatures. I've never had to replace one.\n\nThank you so much, I’m going to check this out\n\nI love the 100% rubber hoses. They last forever and don't kink at all.\n\nYou should look up an Aquazilla! Best hose purchase ever!\n\nShower no debate. 😂 can’t believe this is what my life is having a favorite hose setting but here we are!\n\n&gt;can’t believe this is what my life is having a favorite hose setting but here we are!\n\nit's the good life\n\nI bet you have a favorite burner on your stove too . (front right is the correct answer)\n\nExcuse me, it’s front left.\n\nAnd anyone who says it a a back one is a minster\n\nI used the back ones as much as possible when my kids were little, but now I'm all about that front left life. My husband likes the front right because it's the big burner. He's weird.\n\nCompletely agree! Front left is my jam! 😂\n\nAnd mist to annoy anyone nearby 🥰\n\nI used mist for about a week right after I put down brand new grass seed. Didn't want to wash it away. Worked well!\n\nI use mist and when watering seedlings in the first week\n\nThats a great idea... personally, I've only used it to annoy people.\n\n“Imma get that m.f’er” - my exact thought as I blast my plants on the far end of the garden hose.\n\n💯 it’s like a video game\n\nSoaker for those sloppy summer drinks from the hose\n\nTo fill up the bird bath!\n\nI'm sad that my replacement nozzle doesn't have a soaker setting so I have to use shower on the birdbath like a schmuck\n\nWhy can't they be side by side instead of 180 from each other?!? So frustrating.\n\nThis is the way\n\nThis is the answer!\n\nThis is exactly right. And Water has the same mesmerizing quality as fire so you can totally get into a trance watering. Especially if you’re an early evening, crepuscular waterer. Next thing you know, the moon’s up.\n\nOr if it's really windy\n\nWhat it says about you:\n\nCenter: \"I don't know why I actually bought a hose attachment.\"\n\nFlat: \"I only have enough space for a single row of plants.\"\n\nJet: \"I don't own a powerwasher / F this plant or bug in particular / I'm too lazy to unspool the hose.\"\n\nShower: \"I'm actually watering my plants.\"\n\nMist: \"Protect the babies! / It's too hot out here and I like walking into the mist.\"\n\nSoaker: \"I forgot to water this pot all last week.\"\n\nCone: \"I really want to water everything *except* what I'm pointing at.\n\nWhat is the cone for?!\n\nCone is my fav! It's for reducing your wrist movement while standing further back\n\nYa, I hear you.  Gotta save those wrist muscles for other things.\n\nYeah, tugging at weeds....\n\nAnd masturbating\n\nThanks for holding my sandwich but please don’t call me Shirley.\n\nAt the same time???\n\nI feel like I’d have to move my wrist even more? Because when you stand up close it sprays AROUND the thing you’re pointing at, and when you’re far away it sprays even further around the thing you’re pointing at lol\n\nY’all know that little screw on top of the handle will keep the handle pressed if u turn it to the right\n\nCone is good if you're trying to water the outer root zone of a plant with fragile stems.\n\n~~rainbows~~ hosebows\n\nCone and Flat are great for blasting pests off plants.\n\nMist: “my kid wants to make rainbows”\n\n\"It's too hot out here and I like walking into the mist.\"\n\nSo not just me?! :)\n\nThe jet setting is my go to for annihilating annoying ant hills and landscaping so that it floods their hill every time it rains\n\nDamn. You got us soakers to life right here.\n\nOop “I don’t own a powerwasher” is me\n\nThumb over the end of the hose.  True O.G.\n\nSo primal!\n\nfancy pants it and do the bend\n\ni was explicitly taught bending it will break your hose\n\nAh, a fellow Neanderthal I see.\n\nWe gotta stick together\n\nApes strong together!\n\nCame here for thumb. 👍🏼\n\nI, too, have come for the thumb.\n\nTo be honest it's almost just as good so I do this sometimes rather than find the right sprayer head\n\nI miss this \n\nHoses without nozzle became illegal here (Victoria Australia) with water restrictions years ago\n\nHow does enforcement work? Do they watch for rapid expenditure at your place and then send in the water police? Or is it more like “hey mate, prolly don’t do that”?\n\nYeah they say they 'monitor usage' but surely it'd have to be pretty hectic for them to notice \n\nI think they rely pretty heavily on people dobbing in their neighbours - it's definitely easy to find the 'report someone violating water saving rules' links\n\nThe restrictions we had at the peak of it (back in 2007ish) were pretty fucking annoying - examples include not being allowed to wash cars except for windows/mirrors, only allowed to water your garden on two allocated weekdays between like 6-8am, having to get a permit if you want to top up your swimming pool. Those doing the right thing were thus generally quite ticked off at those who weren't - if someone had the gall to wash their car on their driveway they'd get reported quick smart. I'd say at least some of that instinct still exists - there's probably one grumpy old dude on most streets who'd keep an eye on people?\n\nThere are settings other than jet and shower??\n\nYeah, there’s also a mist mode in case you’re in the mood to make sure everything either burns up in the sun or gets moldy as hell.\n\nMist is for making rainbows in the sunlight\n\nMist is for spraying your face after a day of hard work. Have yet to find another use.\n\nAnother use for mist is watering new seeds! I use it a lot when I plant new seeds close to the surface, I’ll mist them a few times a day and it waters without knocking them around!\n\nMist here too for watering bonsai.  Any and everything else just blasts small gravel right outta the pot.  Rain included.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fab2702y6l9d1.jpeg?width=1400&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=db086f113128e2ddb6ac9c2c026a66e1561d4ce6\n\nI hook up one of these suckers in the center of the garden and let fate decide who lives and who dies\n\nI like your style\n\nI am seeing a lot of hate for my boy SOAKER here - easily the fastest and easiest way to fill up the bird bath to the brim without it all sloshing out!\n\n(Shower for 100% of my plants, then jet to push dirt off the porch)\n\nMy tomatoes love soaker.\n\nSoaker for when I forget to water and for all the trees and bushes in pots. Shower for everything else\n\nI’m old school, using my finger over the end of the hose for different spray\n\nI love that for you.\n\nThanks. It’s not by choice. My spray gun stopped working. I’m envious of you guys.\n\nTruthfully I mostly just use a regular hose from the rain barrel and let it dribble at the base of each plant for 20 minutes. I only bring out the hose sprayer for special occasions.\n\nShower and mist are the only right answers to be honest... Soaker is just hilarious...\n\nSoaker is only good for dumping water on my shoes while I'm carelessly cycling through settings. \n\nWait are you holding down the trigger while cycling spray modes?? Are you an animal?!\n\nHaha, I have that goofy sprayer with the lever on the back rather than a trigger. I can't be bothered to put the lever in the off position before switching settings. I'm a mess.\n\nI have the same ones, and I also have wet shoes\n\nHe also gasses it while changing from reverse to drive\n\nI chortled so obnoxiously\n\nWait...is this not what people do? How am I supposed to know what setting I'm on?\n\nYep, shower and mist are all that I use, unless you count Jet for when I'm trying to blast debris out of the birdbath\n\nJet works great for blasting aphids off plants as well.\n\nI clean tools with jet.  And use flat for under my fingernails.\n\nAs someone who has had more car work than he’d like lately, this is genius\n\nThe gardening tip I never knew I needed!\n\nNow see, Ive never tried flat for that. I just use jet to clean my nails. Might try that one\n\nSoaker works if you turn the water down until it's only a trickle. Then place the hose head directly on top of the soil. It just sort of bubbles slowly out of the hose and into the soil. It's nice for newly planted peppers or tomatoes.\n\nI'm feeling weirded out no one uses soaker?! I use it to slowly bottom water berry plants, trees, and thick patches of flowers and stuff. So easy to let the soaker run a few minutes while I go do something else, then move it to a new spot and repeat...\n\nLol am i a freak or something\n\nYes! I finally got a nozzle that has the finesse to be finely adjustable. It makes all the difference.\n\nIsnt that what the trigger is for?  It lets you control the flow - press it in a tiny amount, a tiny amount of water trickles out, no matter what setting it is on\n\nsoaker should be called “Broken” 😂\n\nMine is broken, so it's always on \"soaker\". I call \"broken\" \"soaker\" now.\n\nI use soaker exactly once a week to water my baby Japanese maple. Once everything else is watered turn on soaker, drop the hose by the tree, and let it do its thing, walk across yard, turn off water, and by the time the water is fully shut off I have a happy tree.\n\nThe chaotic evil of garden hose sprayer settings.\n\nMy head has a setting called flood and it's the same as soaker here. I do use it for my raised bed on wheels I have outside my back door. I'll use it to water the dirt and not get any water on the leaves.\n\nWhat about jet for those out of reach plants?\n\nI’ve never really used mist- what should I be using it for?\n\nI use mist on my bare skin when it's too hot to be out in the sun watering\n\nfreshly planted seeds, until they germinate. Also rainbows.\n\nOther than seedlings/fresh transplants, imo the “mist” setting could be renamed to “powdery mildew attractor” I never use it. \n\nBarely turn the hose on, set it to soaker setting and leave it at the base of plants for 5-10 minutes. Water infrequently but deep\n\nIt's nice after a long run on a hot summer day\n\nOh, also, herbs that have just been transplanted that are just babies.\n\nI use mist to get the bees and wasps off my birdbaths so I can clean and refill them.\n\nShower all day\n\nUnless the plants are far away\n\nThen it’s jet time\n\nI like a good shower setting and a nice mist\n\nCenter is my sun sign. \n\nShower is my moon. \n\nJet is my rising.\n\nShower is my go-to, but I sometimes do a soaker setting for a deep watering on a hot day.\n\nDoes more water come out when using soaker or does it just come out in a different pattern?\n\nI think just a different pattern. It’s basically like just using my regular hose end but without having to take off the sprayer.\n\nShower for most. Soaker for containers. Jet clean for the moss on my patio. Flat to clean surfaces. \n\nI don’t think I can pick a favorite!\n\nI agree, each has its purpose! Mist is for my face when it is 90° outside\n\nlegs too\n\nThis whole post is absolutely hilarious. The simple things in life are often times the best!\n\nIts the shared involvement that were all excited about water hoses and I completely love this for us! 🤣🤣🤣🤭\n\nBack to the question.\nIm a shower mister and jet type\n\nShower: for regular watering when im active that day\n\nMist: for delicate plants in the greenhouse\n\nJet: when i dont feel like leaving the porch\n\nTotally. The nuances of the things we’re passionate about are what bring me joy ❤️\n\nIm here for all of it! 💯🤗\n\nI have been WAITING to be asked this my whole life. Flat.\n\nYou are the *third* person to say flat and I feel like I should introduce you all to each other.\n\nShower. Then mist.\n\nSoaker\n\nI’m a soaker too! I have a container garden though so it is the most efficient at getting the soil of whatever container I am aiming for but without shooting soil everywhere\n\nHello my fellow hot climate container gardening family!\n\nMy grandma used to use the flat setting growing up. I joined the sub Reddit because they remind me of my grandma. She’s not dead. I just miss her.\n\nI first started gardening with my grandma as well :-) I will respect the wisdom of the flat spray. I hope you get to see her soon.\n\n#1 jet \n#2 shower\n\nI like your passion\n\nIt gets so hot in Texas if I don't water at the right time the water droplets burn the leaves. Soaker right into the pot\n\nI’ve been using soaker a lot in NC as well. Long soaks.\n\nShower\n\nMist for seedlings.\n\nJet for succulents who hate having wet leaves (not full blast though, just a little line of water).\n\nShower for vegetables and other in-ground berry/fruit plants.\n\nSoaker for deep watering trees (though not turned up to full blast).\n\nHa, mine is thumb on.\n\nI have two settings thumb on and thumb off\n\nShocked to see even one person for soaker. Soaker is like, “let’s make one to trick people into thinking their sprayer head is broken.”\n\nLaughing while reading the comments makes me realize I (we?) are geeks. Lol!!!!!\n\nGeek: a person who is knowledgeable about and obsessively interested in a particular subject, especially one that is technical or of specialist or niche interest.\n\nHell yeah, we are!!!\n\nFlat\n\nI’m also a flat enthusiast. Shower for large plants, mist for seedlings, flat for the in betweens\n\nFLAT!?\n\nI can't even fathom it. It's like the water equivalent of wildly slashing a knife at your plants!\n\nI didn't realize it was such a controversial opinion\n\nI also use flat (or angle) for long distance instead of a jet. Flat or shower. Soaker for filling up spray bottles.\n\nI use it a lot too\n\nI use shower and flat unless I need to clean the deck off and use jet.\n\nFlat users rise up\n\nCenter is my go to\n\nNot enough love here for Center. It’s been my favorite recently. Soaks my yard quickly and stretches further than Jet. I can water the whole yard and the corner garden plot without even walking to the end of my patio.\n\nI just have...a hose... 🥲\n\nPretty much only shower but I see everyone talking shit on soaker but I think it's by far the best for filling up a container. When I want a more controlled watering or just have plants out of reach I'll fill my watering can with soaker. All the other settings blast so hard that it pretty much just knocks out all the other water.\n\nGarden normally (similar to shower here)\nJet when fighting squirrels\n\nJet for sniping cabbage moths.\n\nShower. Easiest on the soil/plants.\n\nShower 98% of the time, soaker after just planting\n\nShower almost always, and maybe Jet if I need the distance. The rest are never getting selected. Maybe Mist on rare occasions.\n\nHere I am using my thumb, some people have a priveleged existence.\n\nDepends on how far away the person I'm trying to soak is......?\n\nAnyone who chooses \"cone\" here is a psychopath\n\nShower, I point it up at the sky and pretend it’s raining.\n\nJet, so I can watch my dog go \"BLARGRARGRARGBRARGBABRBARRRRGRARGRARRARARBRARRGAR\" while biting at the water and chasing it at full speed while I sweep the water back and forth across the yard.\n\nSoaker for my tomatoes. Makes it easy to water the base of the plant and not the leaves.\n\nShower if plants are involved. Jet if cleaning up.\n\nMy dog says jet. My plants now get watered from a distance and my dog gets her full-force treat 😂😳❤️\n\ni use jet to spray off anything dead i am a monster but idfc a lazy monster\n\nCenter and mist\n\nJet. I am about my business\n\nCone is goated\n\nSoaker\n\nShower for established plants, mist for seeds/seedlings, jet for cleaning up the mess after transplanting seedlings.\n\n95% shower.. 5% jet, so I can wash out the garbage can and back spray myself in the face with garbage can water.\n\nEvery self respecting gardener knows that every setting can serve a unique purpose or function. It's a multi tool but the correct answer is jet so that I don't have to walk as far to wet the root balls in the nursery.\n\nThe dog likes jet, hubby likes center, I like shower, and the kids don't care as long as it makes a rainbow in the sun 😆\n\nShower for the plants, mist for my seeds coming in, jet for my dumb dog\n\nI use flat because I think it looks nice 😂. Judging from the comments I feel so wrong not showering like a normal human being."

Growing flowers or making bouquets? I just started growing things that looked beautiful to me. And started cutting things and putting them in vases. That evolved into more raised beds, more flowers, more books, more YouTube videos on how to.\n\nYes growing.\nThank you! \nAmazing bouquet!\n\nStunning!!!\n\nWhere do you buy your dahlias, and do you buy seeds or tubers?\n\nI grow mostly named varieties, + some seedlings. I usually trade with local friends and fellow dahlia growers. Join your local dahlia society! \n\nI also sell my extra tubers to make more money to buy more tubers. 😂\n\nLove it! I grow my own bouquets too. It's so satisfying.\n\nSo pretty\n\nSo beautiful.

    "all_comment_text": "Yes, greater plant diversity supports greater insect diversity. \n\nWhich supports more bird diversity.\n\nWhich supports more snake diversity.\n\nEventually you'll be overrun with old ladies.\n\nWell of course. Ever been to a botanical garden?\n\nI can’t wait to get my retiree botanical garden outfit. Flowing comfy pants with like 8 pockets, giant hat, but I’ll wear an 2000’s emo band tshirt to stay edgy.\n\nyou can technically rock that outfit today and everyday! why wait until you're retired??\n\nHonestly, nobody would fault anyone for that. I'm firmly on the \"get comfy\" bandwagon\"\n\nI have been recently introduced to fisherman pants and it is life changing!\n\nI'm on the stylishly comfy bandwagon myself. No reason to look like shite in clothes that don't fit whilst also being comfy :)\n\nI uh, wore this last summer, minus the pockets and add a bag. I'm a heavy lady and got hella compliments. 👌\n\nI started wearing exactly that during the first round of lockdowns when I was gardening eight hours a day, and I’ve never looked back.\n\nAbsolutely the class uniform by the current class of master gardeners - t shirt art varies. Even the old ladies are tatted up so you might need to step it up. \n\nYou also need a Buff neck gaiter or bandana. \n\nMost wear long sleeve tech shirts to protect from sun and thorns\n\nTats and bandanas lol. Gangster gardening.\n\nLMAO username. 💚\n\nCarhartt Ripstop scrub pants. They’re rugged, comfy and have a ton of pockets.\n\nOmg! I thought I was the only one looking forward to my senior fit 😂\nFlowy fabrics, large flower prints, and floppy hats 👒? Paired with a comfy set of brightly colored garden clogs.\n\nYes, please!\n\nYeah I got kidnapped by an Indian granny and showed round the glass house in botanic gardens in Belfast. Proper educated that day.\n\nThey'll swallow all the flies\n\nHad to scroll a loooong way up at this point to get the context for this.  Ha!  “That wriggled and jiggled and squiggled inside her….” 🎶\n\nPerhaps she'll die\n\nThe old ladies can’t grow anything in their gardens except tired lol\n\nDamn man, you don't have to come for me like that\n\nlol my nana said that to me the other day and I thought it was hilarious 😂\n\nI feel your nana's pain. I'm still gardening every day but it's slower going with less accomplished. That's ok, it's still fun.\n\nI too feel seen\n\nNo, they just swallow everything. You never heard of the old lady who swallowed the fly?\n\nHey now, wait a minute.\n\nPerhaps she'll die?\n\nShe's dead of course.\n\nCuz she swallowed that horse\n\nWouldn't they swallow that fly?\n\nWhich supports more gorilla diversity.\n\nWhich supports more kaiju diversity\n\nWhich supports more confusion diversity.\n\nWhat is Kaiju?\n\n[Japanese monsters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaiju), Godzilla being the prime example\n\nAhh but that's the thing. The Gorillas die off in the Winter.\n\nHerptile diversity in general.\n\new, you should see someone about that.\n\n[deleted]\n\nFor a second I thought you were eating spiders\n\nThey ate some too\n\nWhich supports the house cat population.\n\nBut they should stay inside so they don't kill all the birdies.\n\nThat'd be nice.\n\nWhich supports the coyote and owl population\n\nExactly. And generally native plants produce even more diversity, especially if there are keystone species in the mix. Keystone species native to an area can support hundreds of different insects. Even the best nonnative species generally supports handfuls of species and sometimes none at all.\n\n[removed]\n\nThat’s a wealth of information right there.   Thank you\n\nThanks, great resource!\n\nworth it tho for the butterflies and other things, and you can mitigate mosquitos with plants like eucalyptus\n\nI have a big old pine nearby that hosts bats, and they eat up nearly all the mosquitoes. I love those bats.\nPlus I didn’t even notice them for like a year and a half, because they only come out at night and only make little clicky noises.\n\nWait… other than having a big old tree, is there a way I can lure bats to my yard?\n\nBat boxes! https://www.batcon.org/about-bats/bat-gardens-houses/\n\nHere are two good resources with information.\n\nhttps://www.batcon.org/about-bats/bat-gardens-houses/\n\nhttps://www.nwf.org/en/Garden-for-Wildlife/Cover/Build-a-Bat-House\n\nMosquitos don't give a fuck about what plants you put in your yard.  They just want standing water.\n\nMosquitoes don't want your plants, they want you.\n\nAt least someone does... \n\nThis hits WAY too close to home...\n\noof. real feals.\n\nSo set a trap with a bucket of water and mosquito dunks. Kills the mosquito larvae, leads to fewer adult mosquitoes.\n\nOr build a small pool with guppies in it. They eat larvae like crazy and don’t pose a risk to other insects trying to drink\n\nYes this!! And you get to watch the fish and relax when you're not working and sweating. And sweating attracts mosquitoes so you can bring the fishes food.\n\nMy sweat brings all the fish to the yard\n\nYes sir, it draws mos-qui-toes\n\nYes sir, it draws mas-qui-toes\n\nI'd teach you, but you'd need a pond.\n\nI'm totally gonna do this ☺️ the pool supports dragonfly larvae too. They eat the hell out of mosquito larvae.\n\nI had success with putting goldfish in my rain barrel.\n\nMy 10 gallon water feature was ROILING with mosquito larvae. Bought 5 30-cent feeder goldfish and the next morning, ZERO mosquito larvae.\n\nThere’s no way a rain barrel is big enough for a gold fish long term.\n\nCorrect\n\nAs an Australian, I assure you the mozzies don't give a crap about whether there's eucalyptus around or not.\n\n“Plants” like eucaplyptus…. You mean gigantic invasive trees like eucalyptus?\n\nI'm an entomologist that works in pollinator conservation, particularly in agricultural and urban settings. While this image is an oversimplification, it's accurate in that plant diversity, and other habitat elements (bare ground, wood, cavities, etc), support a greater insect diversity. I also like it because it shows incremental change. In my work, we try to find ways to help landowners and managers try things and make small changes over time. Test out a small hedgerow but leave your lawn for now, try some cover crop, etc. Then once they dip their toes in, they can try more. I feel like there is this really fired up group of conservation minded folk who think you need to change the landscape overnight. But we've had a ton of success starting small and expanding. \n\nThese practices can be expensive and require technical knowledge, I don't think it's practical to expect everyone in the third image to become the first overnight. Just my thoughts related to this image.\n\nAlso native plants are far better for diversity than a bunch of commercial ornamentals. Not that it's evil to plant conventional ornamentals (unless they're invasive then please just don't plant them) but your flowers should mostly be native options. Also don't forget about grasses, shrubs, and ferns they may not have showy flowers but they're just as important as everything else.\n\nTo piggyback on your comment, everyone knows about monarch butterflies needing milkweed to reproduce and survive, but there are thousands and thousands of species who have similar relationships with specific plants in just the same way.\n\nSo you can have a non-native plant in a garden that is a wonderful source of nectar for mature pollinator species, but without a broad mix of native species, they won't be able to reproduce in your yard.\n\nAlso milkweed is the host plant for only the caterpillars. The adult butterflies don’t really care for it. So if all you’ve got is milkweed, your butterflies are gonna starve.\n\nAnother bonus, native plants are already adapted for your region’s precipitation and weather. You’ll save on watering costs in the long run.\n\nDo you have a website or resource for noobs to start with?\n\nJust to echo the other comment, I'd recommend a few different resources. It'll depend on your location, but there are usually a ton of local resources. Check for master gardeners, local native plant society, garden clubs, etc. Most counties or towns have something going on with gardening using native plants. Go into your local nursery and talk to them!\n\nTry here: https://plantnative.org/category/nursery\n\nHere's like a really general starting point: https://www.fs.usda.gov/wildflowers/Native_Plant_Materials/Native_Gardening/instructions.shtml\n\nPollinator specific:\nhttps://www.pollinator.org/guides\n\nHopefully this helps.\n\nYou can check out r/nativeplantgardening if you're interested! Also check out [this](https://www.nwf.org/Garden-for-Wildlife/About/Native-Plants/keystone-plants-by-ecoregion) list of keystone plants by ecoregion! It'll help you figure out which plants will give you the most \"bang for your buck\" as far as supporting critters goes.\n\nIf it’s saying that each picture is what is most beneficial to its corresponding bugs then yes. The top yard will definitely contribute to more biodiversity in the yard. There would likely be more than just flies in your yard in the bottom but having  basically monoculture yard of lawn grass is not useful to many important species so you would see a lot less of them if any.\n\nAnecdotal evidence, but last summer I was babysitting a preschool aged kid who lived in an HOA neighborhood with perfect lawns. She did a short class on Zoom every day that also had some suggested “homework” assignments with it, and one of them was to go outside and look for insects. Despite the fact that their property backed up to woods and there were literally deer crossing through their backyard, after 30 minutes of looking the only insect we saw was a single stinkbug. I’m sure it was the chemical spraying that was responsible for that more than the plants, but it would be unusual to see a weed-free grass lawn without said chemicals, so that’s another factor that would reduce insect populations.\n\nI grew up on a farm so I am used to having a variety of different bugs, frogs, salamanders, etc. I since moved to the cities living in an apartment where they sprayed the nearest body of water which I feel like I developed a lot of health problems in my time living there. Then I got my own place in a neighborhood where 1950s grass yards were as far as you could see. I got bored of it and started switching to native wild flowers. I started small but immediately noticed a big difference in the bug and bird variety.\n\n60,000,000 pounds of pesticide are applied to american homes each year and a quarter of that is insecticide.\n\nTBH it should just be banned. totally and completely. It's entirely unsustainable.\n\nI'm sort of curious what the breakdown of that is.  How much is targeted like termite treatment?  How much of it is pissing in the wind like mosquito spraying?  Are dog/cat flea and tick preventatives included?\n\nI'd fight a total ban if you tried to take away the termite and tick/flea treatments.\n\nThere are products out there designed to eradicate *all* insects from yards. I witnessed it myself after I visited someone’s home in the country, was outdoors in their yard and noticed how there were 0 insects.  Later, I was informed they use a product. Scary, IMO.\n\nI got a family member with a rather large lake front property and sprays regularly. No bugs. None. Then around the bonfire people will mention how they never see fireflies anymore and how much there used to be back when they were kids. Like, no shit.\n\nDude it's *insane*, the dissonance is unreal! At an old job I listened to a coworker go on &amp; on about how it was chemtrails &amp; the gov't poisoning the woods &amp; that's why there were no fireflies *right after he'd told another coworker about how his pest control guy had sprayed his yard to get rid of \"all bugs, any bugs, ants to hornets to spiders\".*\n\nThe man *could not* see the connection and also was, of course, always quick to talk about how climate change was a hoax *and also how when he was a kid they used to get REAL winters*.\n\nSo what did he say when you mentioned that the pest control is killing his fireflies too?\n\nWhen we moved into our new house our neighbors sent their pest guys to our house saying she’d sent them over to talk about spraying our yard. I was so confused because don’t you want all the cool bugs in your yard? So I turned them away, lol. Our neighbor was not happy. \n\nSmart. If it’s bad for the bugs, in one way or another it’s bad for us.\n\nExactly!! And I have little kids who adore playing in the yard. We spend hours outside everyday. I do not want them in that. We also have a wild prairie like backyard that we keep reasonably maintained so we can play in. Everything is safe and edible so I don’t have to worry about the kids eating anything but we have soooo much bugs and bees and etc. all great for my garden!\n\nI just had someone come to my door asking about spraying my home and yard. It also was over $200 every 3 months for his “final” offer. Sad that people try to get rid of all the bugs, absolutely crazy that people pay that much to do it.\n\nWell said 🗿\n\nOnly thing I’d change is I’d keep the statue in the yard\n\nI believe the science is quite clear on the negative effects of having 🗿 in your yard. They attract flies almost exclusively, and they make the rest of the space practically uninhabitable for other beneficial insects. Be careful out there with your 🗿!!!\n\nYou could probably get rid of that fly if you just add another 🗿\n\nThis made me laugh loudly... Thank you friend\n\n🗿\n\n🗿\n\n🗿\n\n🗿\n\n🗿\n\nI read the 🗿 as uuhn.\n\nHow should you read it?\n\n\"moai?\"\n\nlol .. I like uuhn though.\n\nI've always read it as \"yuh\" since that's what it was called in the discord servers I used to frequent lol\n\nDid you have to say it super aggro like in a Death Grips voice?\n\nI read the 🗿 as uuhn.\n\n[deleted]\n\nIt’s worth noting that this theory of what happened on Rapa Nui is generally losing favor among historians. Slave trading and introduction of disease from Europeans likely played a much larger role in their population decline. I highly recommend “Fall of Civilizations” podcast episode on the subject or even the PBS Nova documentary!\n\nit's not that simple, but the take away is the more diverse your yard is the more diverse critters will find something to eat and come to it\n\nIt's false because it only shows flies in the final pane, not flies AND mosquitos.\n\nUsed to have pesky flies all around our deck, but over the years I've been adding native flowers, grasses, trees and shrubs in both the front &amp; back yards. I've seen far less flies, far less pests on my veggies, and an increase in bumble bees (crop pollination), wasps (organic pest control), lady beetles, butterflies, skippers, ants (aphid farmers), spiders (organic pest control), lacewings, dragonflies, carpenter bees, etc etc. It's incredible how you can build a healthy, thriving ecosystem on a barren, small plot in just a few years by planting native.\n\nLacewings are insane pest control btw. They place their larvae on mealybugs, and just go full blitzkrieg on them.\n\nDragonflies as well, both larvae and adults are extremely efficient pest killers.\n\nIt's not enough just to replace lawn with plants. You have to plant a diversity of native plants from your area with a focus on keystone species. Only native plants support your local food web which are built on an abundance of insects which transfer energy from plants through the ecosystem. This is because insects have co-evolved with host plants and have adapted be able to eat those specific plants i.e. (no milkweed no monarch butterfly). When converting lawn to native landscapes consider the area you live in and try to replicate that ecosystem (forest, desert, prairie, etc.) Since all life (including humans) depends on these complex food webs for survival it is important that we all contribute to conservation and restoration.\n\n100%. r/nativeplantgardening is the best community for native plants on reddit if anyone is interested in knowing more.\n\nThanks for mentioning that. It is a great community/resource.\n\nin my completely unbiased opinion, the mod team there is the best mod team on reddit\n\nThanks, that is a cool sub.\n\n&gt;Only native plants support your local food web\n\nThis is not true. Native plants are better at that but it's not true they are the ONLY ones able to  support native insects.\n\nBlack swallowtail butterflies are more than happy to chow down on non-natives like dill and parsley.\n\nTy for saying thissssss\n\n3rd seems the least interesting.\n\nI kinda like the 🗿\n\nBoomer squares™\n\n[deleted]\n\nUnder 40 here. Mine is #1. People walk by and say your wife has lovely flowers, so many herbs, and so many vegetables. I let them know I’m single and I love my flowers and food that I grow. It stumps the boomers and the 20ish folks.\n\nWe bought in our late 30s, and immediately killed a bunch of the lawn. I've been progressively doing more and more every year, and this year I've finally finished off the \"main\" front lawn. [This XKCD](https://xkcd.com/150/) has been one of my gardening guiding principles.\n\nI love this! People scoff at my seedling set up (100+ at a time) and my 50 or so houseplants. I say my house, my rules. Carry on fellow gardener!\n\nI think the stereotype leans more towards older people working in their gardens more after retirement.\n\nYes, but now that people work from home more frequently I feel like that has changed. I’m in my 30’s and I garden a bunch at my place.\n\nMy Millenial neighbors have a raised bed or two, but it’s mostly lawns for their kids to play. There are of course exceptions. I’m just saying it’s probably the wrong stereotype to think it’s mostly boomers.\n\nYounger people in single family homes are much more likely than older folks to be renters (where I live) - If I'm a renter, I have virtually no say in the landscaping (except to \"maintain\" to the landlord's standard, usually geared toward traditional notions of curb appeal). I'd love to do this, however.\n\nYeah, that’s what I meant when I referenced “home ownership rates”. \n\nI’d still venture it’s more common that a retired person has a diverse and interesting garden. It’s a lot easier when you have time (and own your home).\n\nI'm a millennial who learned how to garden through library books.  I find it better looking and less maintainace to have #1 than #3.  (Although I'll keep the 🗿from the bottom and remove the ivy from the top)\n\nZone 7 in the house!\n\nAs a gen x'er whose father taught me how to garden with natives I find your boomer comment to be stupid and uselessly divisive.\n\nWe don't get much respect now that we are old and in the way🫤\n\nit's ridiculous and stupid.  First off boomers are a large group and withing ANY large group you'll find diversity. \n\nSecondly, who dafuck do they think restored all of the native prairies around the country?  It sure wasn't gen z or millenials.\n\nGroups like the Audobon society are run by boomers (among others) and have been doing this work for generations.\n\nI agree. Gardening knowledge is handed down, and it takes years of trial and error to know what works best in your area and your particular plot of earth. It is one of the skills that continues to evolve over the years. My parents’ back yard at my childhood home was an amazing and diverse ecosystem of flowers, fruits and veggies. Yes, you see retired people working in their yards more often, but they also have decades of experience that they can pass along!!\n\nthe boomer squares in my country are more like the one on top. the ones by the younger gen are more like buttom....\n\nThat's pretty neat. There's a stark contrast between the people who \"keep up with the Robinson's\" bottom and the top \"this is a place of life\".\n\nAnd yet most common in the US.\n\nThe bug remaining should be mosquitos.\n\n[deleted]\n\nAnd r/nativeplantgardening\n\nThey stole a fucking Moai 🗿\n\nNo, Costco sells them now I think.\n\nReplacing half of my backyard with creeping thyme saw a huuuge boost in honeybees visiting\n\nThis year for my wildflowers, I did a field of red clover. Holy cow the number of bees and butterflies was incredible!  I already pretty much disliked grass for its wastefulness, watching neighbors weed and spray and mow and on and one just to get that uniformity that they are told how lawns should be.\n\nYes, that’s how it works. More plants, plants at different heights and more types of plants will attract more biodiversity. Not just bugs either. Different types of birds and animals too. Plain, manicured lawns destroy whole ecosystems. A yard like the first image creates ecosystems.\n\npeople whom create and execute native gardens will attract native insects. Some of which will be beneficial (eg insects that eat insects). \n\nMosquitoes don’t care though and will be present in all gardens.\n\nFALSE \nThere’s a missing species in the top bracket called the “HOA”\n\nFlies are the shittiest ones anyway and you get those no matter what lol\n\nIs less monoculture good for insects? Yes.\n\n Yes, monoculture is a death sentence for any ecosystem\n\nThere’s a good bit of truth to it. Though of course it’s simplifying a complex ecosystem.\n\nI think I’m gonna start posting pics of all the diff insects my garden attracts this summer. I’m gonna avoid neem oil and just let the food chain play out. \n\nThe green lacewings and pirate bugs are my favorite sentinels\n\nThis is what I've decided. If certain things get decimated? Oh well. I've pretty much given up on Asiatic lilies now, because they bring their own bespoke invasive bugs that kill the lilies. I also leave leaf litter everywhere I possibly can, and don't touch any of the leaves at all until mid April when the weather warms up.\n\nBlue-winged wasp is my favorite! Parasitoid wasps are so rad.\n\nYes. Common sense should tell you that a lack of diversity and natural growth is absolutely harmful to every living organisms in one way or another. These perfect lawns people try to achieve is one of the biggest lies to blind human beings.\n\nNo, adding an Easter Island head to your yard won't scare away the butterflies. \n\nThat's what you're asking, right?\n\nThey all forgot about the mosquitoes.\n\nAnd the ticks\n\nGet some possums. Those crazy meth-rats will eat all the ticks they can find.\n\nWe have a healthy native possums population, and yet I have gotten Lyme disease from (urban and native plant-focused) parks twice in my time here.\n\nAbsolutely. And your neighbors affect you too. I have to hand pollinate zucchini and squash in my garden because my neighbors either have no plants at all, or have a manicured garden and pay a monthly pest service to spray. For 3 years I didn't see a single bee in my garden or fruit trees. They just started appearing again last year.\n\nHell yes, this is true. We put grass all over when we first bought our 1950s house. We're remedying this mistake now. We just took out the entire front lawn. It's being replaced with foodscaping and pollinator friendly plants. It brings me so much joy to provide habitat for my native animals. My yard will be covered in predatory wasps, all sorts of bees, spiders, and dragonflies. Do you know what I hardly ever have? Mosquitoes and flies. I never get bit or stung. Just don't freak out when one runs into you. They're clumsy as hell, cheeky, and so curious.\n\nYeah you’re not going to get a ton of pollinating insects if you don’t have plants that need/produce it. Without flowers, you’re not getting bees or butterflies that’s for sure\n\nHabitat!\n\nNo.  There will always be mosquitos.  Otherwise, yes.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zd5bt8ylypxc1.jpeg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=812bd45a1ebc55a5edd5b019b20917b575aa3d5e\n\nYes to diversity…\n\nCommon sense, come back to these people 🤦🏼‍♀️\n\n100% true.\n\nIt's true. The Easter Island statue scares away insects.\n\nIf you like unfettered nature and don’t mind the various drawbacks, pick #1 . If you prefer a very manicured look and don’t like ticks and mosquitoes, go with #3.\n\nWhatever you do though, I’d  recommend ignoring the crybullies who don’t know anything except their own agenda.\n\nI can confirm!  In the last few years, I’ve been evicting as much grass as possible and putting in wildflowers and a more natural garden. \n\nAt first I started with lots of grass and then added a few raised beds. Those went out the door because they generally didn’t look good and just underperformed. So I pulled those out and started making paths, noting where I liked to walk around the lawn. I had visited and fell in love with Hemmingway’s house in the Florida keys, so I started putting in brick paths and everything and law is for the wildlife. \n\nSince i started, I have so much to watch for out the window. One example is bluebirds. We never used to see them on our property. Since the re-Wild of my yard, I have had returning families. Last year we had two parent couples and 7 hatchlings that we got to watch mature over the year. Already this year we have one family of 5 for sure and waiting to see what others leave the nest. 11 was just the most we’ve seen at one time and that’s mixed in with hummingbirds, mockingbirds, cardinals, blue jays, wrens, chickadees, and some sparrows. \n\nThen there the possums and raccoons, a rat snake and a king snake too!  Probably the greatest result was getting frogs back. They seem to have left entirely for a long time. Now they sing at night again, and I have to watch my step in the spring for all the tiny little frogs getting their start. \n\nYes!  Those pictures tell an accurate story, if not thoroughly enough.\n\nKinda' true, but all three scenarios are missing mosquitoes.\n\nHOAs must love Flys.\n\nThey forgot ants. Ever play simant?\n\nNot quite but it gets the point across\n\nUh, yeah, biodiversity.\n\nWell yeah, most insect species don’t eat grass\n\nWhere are the gnomes?\n\nYes it is true\n\n100% true\n\nMy plants bring all the grannies to the yard! Damn right but I have to charge....\n\nYes. This is true. Diversity is the spice of life.\n\nOf course! And not just insects. The more plant diversity you have, the more overall biodiversity. Lizards, insects, fungi in the ground, bacteria (good), birds...\n\nA traditional lawn is really not that far off straight up desert when it comes to biodiversity. It compacts the soil due to very shallow root systems, it's a monoculture and it doesn't produce any flowers.\n\nA patch of lawn is nice to have, but we should be surrounding it with beautiful, diverse gardens, full of natives that would usually grow in that area.\n\nNot true. Every one of those scenarios includes hundreds of spiders. Spiders everywhere…\n\nMonoculture is unsustainable, and has adverse effects on the environment around it.\n\nNo. You'll also get mosquitoes. There's always mosquitoes.\n\nBug fear statue\n\nMost infographics are put together by folks who know nothing about the subject matter in the graphics.  They are merely for views, clicks shares and ultimately profit.\n\nI bet that one lonely bug at the bottom is actually a termite. Nothing left to eat but the house, here I come\n\nI don't understand why they had to get rid of the Easter Island head?\n\nNo, the mosquitoes are still missing in the last image.\n\ngreen deserts suck. over fertilized lawns should be illegal!\n\nThe top is native full on messy beautiful. The bottom one is rich assholes. Which one do you want? To add, the manicured lawn on the bottom is definitely sprayed with pesticide, herbicide, and liquid fert. The shrubbery as well(but only pesticide, an liquid fert, herbicide will kill them gotta use specially formulated stuff that targets weeds). Fun fact, if the spray companies do not swap products every few months, the buggies build up resistances."

I would totally buy a carrot from the dog balancing the carrot on his head.😂\n\nYour doggy looks like it’s selling veggies at a farmers market in the first pic. So cute\n\nomg I love them. You should start an insta account for your dogs and your awesome garden!\n\nGreat harvest.  Do you start your seeds indoors or purchase plants?\n\nEverything is either started indoors or direct-sown 🙂\n\nHow did you manage to grow such an amazing crop of dogs?

How do you save it?\n\nI freeze/can/dehydrate and share with friends. I try to make my harvests last as far into the winter as possible\n\nI have so many tomatoes and peppers idk what to do with them all! You can freeze peppers?\n\nSpaghetti sauce uses lots of tomatoes! I have frozen chopped bell peppers to use later, and my dad freezes his hot peppers too.\n\nIn vacuum sealed bags?\n\nVery sweet!!\n\ngreat pic\n\nWow this is awesome! Thanks for the scale 😉\n\ndoggy with carrot is hilarious !\n\nI am dying, I love them all. I would 100% buy all my produce from those doggos.\n\nThese photos made me so happy, thank you for sharing!\n\nTell your dogs I said I love them\n\nI had to do a double take with the carrot for a hat. Adorable😆\n\nWell done and the dogs are impressive too\n\ncame for the veg, stayed for the good bois\n\nWhat happened to the hat?  Nice harvest and dogs.\n\nAww I love your dogs ❤️ 🐕\n\nBest garden haul pics this season!\n\nWowza!  Very impressed!  Great job!\n\ni just can't with the carrot on top of his head! soooo cute!\n\nthat carrot pic is sooo... wasn't me.\n\nAmazing bounty!🥰\n\nThe carrot on his head ☺️\n\nBeautiful pictures\n\n#I Hope My Garden Produces Poppets As Furry &amp; Fun As Yours!!!\n\nOk \n1.  Thats adorable.  \n2.  Playing fast and loose with that banana rule OP\n3.  I think we should all agree your dogs are the new banana.\n\n:)\n\nWhat a great picture! The dog looks so into having its photo taken!\n\n[removed]\n\nThis is my first year getting peaches off my trees so they win fav crop of the year!

We moved to a new place in zone 6A &amp; have to get a soil test done.  The garden here doesn't produce worth a wooden nickel!  It's frustrating the wife &amp; I to no end.\n\nSuch an impressive harvest &amp; such beautiful doggos. What was your favorite tomato variety you grew this year? &amp; can we pls see more of your gorgeous garden???\n\nEsterina and Sundipper are my fav tomato varieties - I love growing ones I can snack on when I’m hanging out in the garden!\n\nLovely 😊🥕\n\n😍😍\n\nYeah…sure…dogs for scale🙄🙄🙄 Adorable!\n\nThe forehead carrot!!! I cannot with the cuteness!\n\nPic 2. Carrot top’n! Love it!\n\nIt’s the carrot on your pup’s head for me. We do not deserve doggos! 🥹🥹\n\nGood doggo!\n\nLove the fur babies. Beautiful harvest!!\n\nYour carrots are enormous. Do they start to taste weird when they get that big? Also, your dogs look very happy.\n\nNo weird taste! They are storage varieties so not super sweet to start with but still tasty. I’ve got some real monsters still in the ground that I can’t wait to pull up later this fall. My dogs are always stealing the carrots so I plant a ridiculous amount to account for the theft hahaha\n\nIt's a tax. Some do consider that theft.\n\nPerfection!\n\nI love them all 😭💕 Nice garden too!\n\nThis is a perfect example of why scaling is so important. We could have missed some key details. Thank you for your diligence OP.\n\nPlease share how to grow the Canis Verygoodigus Familiarus!\n\nCongrats on a great garden season! How long did those carrots take ?\n\nCarrots were sown early May in very loose soil (bed is amended every fall with compost and every spring with perlite and vermiculite). I start harvesting them early July as needed and end up with about half the patch left in the fall for winter storage. I sow around 30sq ft of them.\n\nThank you.for the detailed reply, will try this method next spring 🥰\n\nIs this how you amend all your beds or just the carrot bed? I'm very new to gardening, and while things grow, they don't produce like this! I've never amended a bed before and thought about doing so with Black Cow Manure from the store this fall and next spring, but I wasn't sure if that's the correct thing to do.\n\nYep! Although put extra perlite in the carrot/root veg beds just to make it extra fluffy. Just putting organic matter (leaves, grass clippings, chop and drop spent plants) on your beds in the fall and letting it break down over winter will do a lot for your soil 😊 I’m sure cow manure in fall and spring will be a good addition\n\nDogs for scale. You mean Dogs for added cuteness!! ❤️❤️\n\nTHIS! This is the content I come here to see!\n\n[deleted]\n\nIt’s truly their garden, I’m just the muscle\n\nAnd the thumbs. A lack of opposable thumbs is what keeps us from a full on pet revolution\n\nLove this! 🫑🐶\n\nThis is my idea of a perfect garden!  A great harvest like you have, with your special adorable dogs being involved and being your companions. Thank you for sharing!!\n\nWhere do you get seeds to grow doggos like those? So cute ☺️\n\nAwwww\n\nIt's hard to acknowledge how plentiful and how much wow factor your harvest has with those super cut doggos, but wow!  What a great year you've had!\n\nYou sure have abundance  good at gardening\n\nI love dogs for scale!!\n\nVery nice!\n\nOh my god puuuuuups\n\nI hope the dog's name is Banana.\n\n😆\n\nAbsolutely beautiful bounty! Love peppers!! and the pups are cute too.\n\nI definitely read this like you - the fellow in the hat - posted this 😂\n\nI, for one, think \"dogs for scale\" should be mandatory in all harvest posts 😂\n\nDogs for scale is best scale\n\nI love the first pic lol. Your dog looks so proud. He’s like “look at my prized treasures”\n\nI think the farmer is smoking a different crop tbh\n\nWhat soil did you use in your beds?\n\nThey were originally filled with logs/organic debris and covered with bulk compost and perlite. Every winter I cover them in grass clippings/leaves/composted chicken manure and by spring it’s pretty well broken down. Then I just mix in perlite/vermiculite to the new top layer and am good to go 👍\n\nDoes the perlite help with weed control? I bought a pretty expensive 50-50 mix of organic compost and garden soil from the nursery and it has been nothing but weed central for the past two years. I’ve even covered the bed in the winter time.\n\nNope, perlite is for drainage/keeping the compost light and fluffy. I had a weedy first year with our original bulk compost order - lots of straw mulch between crops really helped get it under control.\n\nWhat’re the black peppers in the background of picture #4?\n\nTransylvanian Slim Jim from Matt’s Peppers; they start purple and turn red when ripe\n\nI usually do this in the badly drawn subreddit but I couldn’t resist the carrot picture\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kyhgdzkabspd1.jpeg?width=1195&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=687b87b45891d4d7d1dee6f4b9e2388cd9559964\n\nOmg this is amazing! Thank you, this made my day 😊🥲\n\nDid you keep the pups away from the tomatoes? I’ve heard the plants are toxic to dogs?\n\nCanada is zone 6?"

    "all_comment_text": "“They cant see me” \n*nose drip* \n“Ah my cover is blown!”\n\nThey're my wife's favorite animal. She calls them her familiars. \n\nWe had one last year that slept in our open air compost bin  at the end of the garden due to the warmth. Anytime I had to drop off kitchen scraps I had to gently lift him out with a snow shovel as he hissed at me. \n\nI thought of him as a patron saint of the compost, a servant of entropy.\n\nOpossums get a terrible rap. They're very gentle creatures. And they're EXTREMELY short lived for a larger mammal.\n\nWhy so short lived?\n\n[deleted]\n\nSo you’re saying if I catch one I’m doing it a solid. Got it. Going to go tell my husband I have to. For the possums.\n\nWould you rather live in a nice prison until 80 or die free at 20?\n\nHonestly, a nice prison sounds amazing these days.\n\nSeriously. My retirement plan is a prison in Norway.\n\nDo I have to pay bills in prison? Because this ain’t it out here.\n\nAlso I’m obviously not serious. I do have a few who frequent my back porch who I thoroughly enjoy seeing and encourage being in the area as I haven’t seen a single tick.\n\nThose are things most creatures have to contend with. The truth is there is no actual answer other than speculation that there was no prevailing evolutionary incentive to live longer based on their current set up. One of those \"if it ain't broke don't fix it\" things, whatever they're doing between diet adaption and birth rate is enough.\n\nTheir life spans are just a couple of years! If you check out @juniperfoxx on Instagram, she’s a certified wildlife rescuer/rehabber and has rescued a few opossums and shares info about them (in addition to her other animal rescues) :)\n\nShort life spans is why I had to switch to pets that live for a long time. Rats are super cool pets. Super smart. Live only 2 years. Ferrets are amazing, only 7-8 years. Got a kitty cat now. Every time they die it hurts like a mofo. I should really get a bird or a turtle.\n\nThey also have a lot of babies that usually die off by natural selection as well. Frequent mating ages them several years in a 2-3 yr time span.\n\nThe Virginia opossum is the only species found in the United States and Canada. It is often simply referred to as an opossum, and in North America it is commonly referred to as a possum. (/ˈpɒsəm/; sometimes rendered as 'possum in written form to indicate the dropped \"o\"). Opossums should not be confused with the Australasian arboreal marsupials of suborder Phalangeriformes that are also called possums because of their resemblance to the Didelphimorphia. The opossum is typically a nonaggressive animal and almost never carries the virus for rabies.\n\nAlso, they have 50 teeth...\n\nThe Australian ones are soooo cuuuute! Unless they're defending their territory, then they sound like Satan's screaming asshole. But apart from that? You can hand feed them a chip and they'll just gently grab it from your hand. They come to pspspsps more than cats do.\n\n“Satan’s screaming asshole” 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣\n\nGood bot\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y4i9vlo9cobd1.jpeg?width=450&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7bd234b07feb529dbeac0b7e6ca9531b4dd8bb96\n\nWe have them come through our backyard every couple months and my wife has named them all ‘Pickles’. She always lets me know when Pickles is back.\n\nI worked with them in wildlife rehab. The babies are the sweetest and most docile out of any other baby wild animal I worked with. They would sit in your hand and curl their tail around your finger. (I'm talking when they're hamster size and smaller, they get spicier when they're older)\n\nI had one that found access to the ventilation of my house and ended up in my bathroom. I walked in on him one night when I went to pee (the vent cover was broken and I never bothered to replace it). The rapid thumps followed by the freeze frame after it got behind my toilet were comedically amazing in hindsight. The real kicker? There were signs that the vent was messed with/disturbed before which I shrugged off because I lived alone so who could have done anything? During this time I even awoke from a dream to what felt like tiny feet walking on me, but groggy me chocked it up to the dream and rolled right on back over. Long story short- I had a possum for a roommate and I don’t know how long he was there or just how intimate we were.\n\nLmaooo!!!!\n\nOne of their defense mechanisms is to start drooling and foaming/bubbling at the mouth to look diseased.  I think he was in bubble prep mode…\n\nMy socially awkward dog would always do this at the dog park.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3zhemvvrebcd1.jpeg?width=1290&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7c0a42742ceffe6ab13a025a10af5acf5fafe2d8\n\nI thought that possum was taking a piss on your flowerpot\n\nProbably does. Right on the basil\n\n🤢🤮\n\nIt'll wash right off ...\n\nThat might be why it looks like it's doing so well.\n\nProblely why they always say, \" wash your produce before muching !\" 😅\n\ngotta really wash it juuust in case!!!!\n\nThe produce we pickup in the grocery stores might have seen worse!\n\nLmfao I totally would, can’t imagine what you could catch.\n\nMost likely not rabies. They are very rarely infected due to their low body temperature!\n\nLeptospirosis, on the other hand…\n\nHarmless plus they eat ticks!\n\nAnd don’t get rabies 🤙\n\nNo way for real?!\n\nTheir body temperature makes just extremely rare if not impossible. Their natural personality causes a lot of people to call them in thinking they're rabid though lol\n\nThey need a little PR campaign: \"not rabid, just weird\"\n\nWe’re not big rats, we are introverted compost badgers!\n\nJust like me!\n\nThat’s my slogan personally.\n\nThat's a good idea for a shirt\n\nBand name\n\nThat would do wonders for my tinder bio\n\nToo relatable\n\nI used to hate possums but yep! They eat all the bad bugs. Don’t carry disease and just play dead unless their babies are near\n\nEdit- rabies\n\nThey don't get rabies but they can carry plenty of diseases. Leptospirosis is one of them, and that is not pleasant, to say the least. \n\nI like possum, I think they're super cute and they're pretty docile usually, but saying they don't carry disease is not correct.\n\nDon't hold hands or kick them. 😁\n\nI’m literally mind blown right now this is awesome 🤯🤘🏼\n\nUntil they take a massive dump in your oregano. No more oregano for me the rest of that year.\n\nIsn’t that how the natural world fertilizes itself?\n\nMy pet quails, terrorized insensible 4/7 nights this week by a big possum picking at the hardware cloth trying to get to them, would beg to differ, lol.\n\nTbf quails are terrorized insensible by most anything.\n\nThe price of being small and delicious v__v\n\nlmaoooooooooo\n\nThat's not true. That article that has circulated the internet has been debunked. Opposum are actually considered carrier hosts for ticks. \n\n[Do opposum eat ticks?](https://extension.psu.edu/do-chickens-guinea-fowl-or-opossums-control-ticks#:~:text=The%20authors%20concluded%20that%20opossums,consume%20many%20ticks%20at%20all.)\n\nI can tell you right now that possums absolutely eat ticks and all other small insects.\n\nThey also kill, clean and strip rats. I could not figure out what was killing rats in the garden a few years before I adopted a cat to chase the rat hordes out. I would find the dead rats nearby, under a tree. The next day, a portion of them would be stripped down to the bone. If I left them there, the entire body would get cleaned into a white rat skeleton.\n\nPossum mothers love my fruit trees and garden areas. I serve as a possum baby dumping ground. I will find them in August, wandering about the tomato bushes, looking very confused. Like a \"where's mom\" type of look. One possum actually took a nap underneath a tomato plant. They hang out for a day or two before they amble on, ready to start life on their own. I love them in the garden because they clean up all of the tomatoes that have fallen off the vine due to disease, or those that I've tossed for one reason or another. They also clean up on the black figs that fall off the fig tree.\n\nAwesome little creatures. Very welcome in my yard. But, yeah, I have heard that they enjoy a lifespan of 2-3 years. I think this is one reason why they were never domesticated.\n\nHappy Cake Day 🎂!\n\n“WTF?” - ticks, probably.\n\nBro was just grocery shopping ingredients for some pesto.\n\nSooo cute, and he's getting the bugs for you!\n\nWe have a baby one, we think maybe orphaned, who moved into our compost bin. My husband now knocks on the lid to let him/her know a delivery is coming before putting more garden waste in 😂 .\n\nAww! Opossums really don’t do much harm whereas raccoons always get in my trash and eat my vegetables the opossums seem to leave everything alone.\n\nIf you sprinkle baby powder around and on the lids of your trash bins, the raccoons will stay away.  Found that on the internet and it really works.\n\nReally i never heard of that i will try that.\n\nIs it the old baby powder with talc? Because my newish one without it is on every diaper in the trash and they just toss those like basketballs to get under it\n\nThe new stuff.  I sprinkled it on the ground around the bins, and on the lids.  Worked like a charm.\n\nMy raccoons were fighting last night with their kids present so I had two adults and 8 -10 toddler like raccoons 🦝 tumbling like pandas into my sunflowers ! I was so mad they’re lucky their kids are friggen adorable\n\nHaha! so cute! My neighbor has 3 baby raccoons going savage on her porch plants, i must be getting the parents since i never see the babies.\n\nOmg yes! Everything potted is always on its side and they love the wind chimes!!! Little chaos pandas but so so so cute\n\nfucking raccoons\n\nthat is all\n\nI want to live in a place with cute garden visitors.\n\nCome and live with us.  We have deer, foxes, raccoons, opossums, rabbits, a groundhog named Gregory, and the occasional coyote and bobcat.\n\nMy camera reel would be bursting.\n\nAnd skunks, and voles, and, especially gophers.\n\nI'm not sure on the skunk. Although, I may have been influenced by Pepe le Pew.\n\ni mean rabbits are cute...but man they are fucking destructive lol\n\nNo one:\nThe possum: \"No I wasn't!!\"\n\nI feed my possums every night \nSpoiled rotten\n\nWhat do you feed them?\n\nSpoiled, rotten food, apparently.\n\n😆 🤣 😂\n\nNope they only get the good stuff lol\n\nA banana..cookies...cereal..cheese crackers and my leftovers...they eat good !!!!\n\nLove these guys. It saddens me that many people hate them. I think they are amazing because they eat ticks and other nasty bugs and they don't get rabies.\n\n[Do opposum eat ticks?](https://extension.psu.edu/do-chickens-guinea-fowl-or-opossums-control-ticks#:~:text=The%20authors%20concluded%20that%20opossums,consume%20many%20ticks%20at%20all.)\n\nSo that article says that one study concluded that opossums eat tons of ticks. Another study said they eat none.     It also says that fowl don’t eat ticks which is so so untrue.  I know a place that was so infested with ticks that they purchased a flock of Guinea fowl to control them.   \n\nOpossums eat ticks and anything else they find.\n\nYou. Saw. Nothing. Ok. Bye.\n\nI always thought you didn’t want these rascals around (along with others), but do they really help with ticks &amp; other pests? I honestly never really thought about it 🤷🏼‍♀️\n\nMost definitely! You want them hanging out!\n\nThey drive my dog insane\n\nYes! They eat mice, etc.\n\n[Do opposum eat ticks?](https://extension.psu.edu/do-chickens-guinea-fowl-or-opossums-control-ticks#:~:text=The%20authors%20concluded%20that%20opossums,consume%20many%20ticks%20at%20all.)\n\nEven if they don't actually help with ticks, they don't really cause problems either. Why are you on a crusade to bust that particular myth based on one article?\n\nTwenty six articles, not one. Helps reading more than the first paragraph. 🤷\n\nFun fact, they make surprisingly fantastic pets when taken in by humans as babies (they are wild don’t try it), but only live for 1-2ish years. Their natural instinct is to aggressively cuddle and massage you. It’s called Slubbing.\n\nAnd it's incredibly difficult to keep them healthy in captivity due to their dietary needs or they'll get a debilitating and excruciating metabolic disease, and apparently the supplements they need are expensive. It's really not ethical to keep opossums as pets. The ones seen on social media are usually non releasable for various reasons and are kept by qualified rehabbers/wildlife experts.\n\nThat's wild\n\nThe baby opossums are really rowdy at this time of year. Are they leaving mom, or are they just feeling more confident now that they are older? Hmmm.\n\nWe have a bunch in my neighborhood, and they are super funny. My kid and their boyfriend managed to get one untangled from the neighbor's cucumber netting without anyone getting injured. The little critter was chowing down on cucumbers even after it got stuck. It was like it just gave up trying to get away and decided to have a nice meal instead.\n\nHaven’t seen a mom around at all! Just this little guy\n\nSomething I experienced that was wild to me: When we lived in Germany a few years ago, we went to a wildlife park and they had a Virginia opossum exhibit. Having lived entirely in the US until that point, I was so confused as to why on earth they had a possum exhibit because I’d seen them around the yard plenty of times back home. But, turns out, it was something most people there hadn’t seen before and it did have a small crowd around the enclosure when we passed by.\n\nPlease, please, please! If he comes back can you name him “Pesto”? 😄\n\nWell this comment made my day!!\n\nLove them. I feed them cat food\n\nWe have four kitties already so that’s a lot of mouths to feed lol\n\nMaybe a bowl of H2O put in between these two planters, given the temps.? Just a thought since you don't seem to mind having it around ;D CHEERS!\n\nwell i can imagine that's not going to go over real well if they find out you want to share their food with others lmao\n\nAss halfway up- heart beating fast as he makes the decision to fight or shake his furry booty.\n\nim from turkey and currently living in florida. the 1st time ive seen an opossum in my yard at night i freaked out so much, only to get some cat food out 2 mins later lol.\n\nnow i love them and raccoons and often leave food for them outside\n\nYour cat should have a collar if you let him roam outside.\n\nCaught in the act!\n\nThat's a spicy basil\n\nWe named ours bitey. If you respect their distance and leave them alone, they become like outside pets\n\nBest pest control goes tooooooo!!!! This little friend\n\nLucky duck!\n\nWellll… this is awkward\n\nI love these guys! I wonder what made everyone hate them so much.\n\nHissy face no look like kissy face\n\n\nI love their goblin fingers and little ears\n\nFound one about the same size stealing all my blueberries last week!\n\nFun fact! It’s very rare for opossums to have rabies, I believe due to their body temp being different than the usual hosts.\n\nJust checking for ticks, lol, lift yer shirt\n\nRemember the old saying… “Check under the tail to see if it’s Male”\n\ncute litte possy baby\n\nThey are the only marsupial in North America.  If you see one hit in the road 😢 it would be appreciated to check for babies.   If any found and are alive, a box with a blanket and call wildlife rescue.  Good luck if you are in NE NJ like me.  Wildlife rescue is only a dream.  Hubs and I learned the hard way.\n\nBebe\n\nim from turkey and currently living in florida. the 1st time ive seen an opossum in my yard at night i freaked out so much, only to get some cat food out 2 mins later lol.\n\nnow i love them and raccoons and often leave food for them outside\n\nSomebody get this guy a tissue\n\nI have a cat named Possum!\n\nThey say if you see one at the side of the road (recently hit) to check if their are live babies in the pouch (similar to kangaroo).\n\nWell if you get bitten by them you cant get rabies.\n\nOh my, what a little cutie! \nI had a rescue opossum named scruff for a few years. They are surprisingly snuggly and soft!\n\nHe mad he been seen\n\nSo ugly they are cute\n\nChef Possumtatouille gonna make some caprese salad.\n\nPossums are friends for sure but do not approach that animal. A possum is a nocturnal animal and while they may be seen at dawn and dusk, this one is both drooling and acting abnormal.\n\nIt is most likely rabid. If it does not get lost and continues to hang out there you are going to have to call your local animal control or department of wildlife.\n\nIf it starts doing the two step it 100% should be considered rabid.\n\nIt’s really rare for an opossum to contract rabies due to their lower body temperature.\n\nIt is also really rare to get struck by lightning but we generally do not go play golf in the middle of storms.\n\nI know this, my concern is that he is just a little guy, he is drooling a lot and acting kind of unusual, plus we are experiencing heatwaves.\n\nBusted...\n\nMan my childhood hero Basil brush is looking rough these days 😩\n\nAww, a rabbit!\n\nGrinner.\n\nLove opossums !,,\n\nomg such a cute rat\n\nOh dear, must be hungry 🤩❤️\n\nHe's a good guy!\n\nLook how cute!\n\nFriend?.....or foe. Bum bum BUMMMMMMMM\n\nPARKOUR… paused\n\nHe's kinda skinny. They're usually fatter.\n\nGenerally great to have around because they eat ticks. Usually nocturnal though. Use caution.\n\nHe is sweet, cute, and adorable!🥰\n\nomg so cute!\n\nSo I had no idea that when \"playing possum\" it is completely involuntary. My dog went for one and after we put the dog in the house my hubby went to check on it. It would not move and we were worried/googled it.  The emit a scent like death at this time also... and I'm pretty sure it lasts an hour or two. We had to relocate him somewhere safe until he came around.\n\nYes, they faint with fear.\n\nLol don't move! They can't see us if we don't move!\n\nSo cute!\n\nOmg look at that little face. So adorable.\n\ntalk to them nicely and leave catfood mixed with blueberry yogurt out for them and they will love you.\n\nWhat a good friend to have!\n\nI will take them and skunks over raccoons any day ♡ such good little garden helpers\n\nI’m desperately interested in attracting possum to my yard after picking 3 ticks off myself already. If they like basil, I’ll plant more!\n\nThat’s a really good friend to have!  I wish I had some like that!\n\nSpecial kitty!\n\nI love these things so much\n\nMy husband had somehow grown up never seeing a 'possum.  We moved to the mountains and had been hearing stories about the mountain rats and how they can be really big.  One evening, there was something on our porch and he peaked out the little window in our door and exclaimed, \"It's true!  That's the biggest rat I have ever seen in my life!\"  \n\nIt was the first 'possum he'd ever seen in his life.\n\nFuck it just leave him alone he just wants hugs\n\nThat is the cleanest possum I've ever seen.  They are usually hella dirty.  \n\nI am so jealous! I want a little garden friend like him! All I have are bugs, voles, and squirrels. They’re all great, but not nearly as cute as that little guy!\n\nI have one that comes up on our back porch for peanuts.  It's really sweet. It bothers no one and leaves when it's belly is full!\n\nTHAT,  is one ugly cat.\n\nWhat a sweetie!!\n\nPesto Possum\n\nOpossums are such good little friends.\n\nI saw someone walking a opossum on a leash on a  beach boardwalk.\n\nWhat the hell is that??? Please tell me you live very far from Ireland too, cos I would shit my pants if I saw one of those in my garden...\n\nIndiana 😂😭\n\nThank god. The whole Atlantic between me and that fella.\n\nCute little girl or boy.\n\nLooks like he watered your plants\n\nHopefully he was eating slugs... Lol that's so funny... I don't mind opossums in my garden at all. Can't stand slugs!\n\nWhoa!!!\n\nThey eat insects that you would rather not have around.  They don’t get rabies and just want to be left alone.  All around excellent wildlife to have nearby.\n\nDrax surely looks way worse in real life!\n\nWHAT is that?? A salamander???\n\nI'll assume you've by now read 50 other comments that reveal the answer...\n\nOh I absolutely love it. The only problem I have with opossums is if you have chickens, they try and eat them.\n\nI mean, that's fair. We know chickens are scrumptious.\n\ncan confirm. eat them 7 days a week\n\nMy neighbor has a Labrador retriever that does the same.\n\nBoth are equally adorable though"

It's a wonderful photo sequence.\n\nI wanted to capture the process like a science project. I took a photo every day! These were the highlights of each phase.\n\nThis is incredible. I love the pic where the butterfly is showing through the chrysalis; about to emerge. You must have been soooo excited.\n\nIt was wild! This was literally yesterday afternoon. It happened so quickly! I was hoping to watch it happen live so I could record it. It was like Christmas in a sense with how excited I was to see it hatched!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y37fireh7gqd1.jpeg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=46a37f99f0b9239a01642b7cfa7b0056ae27c085\n\nI'm so happy! The Monarch's population is dwindling.\n\nMy neighbors are pretty thoughtful in the plants they have in their garden. We have many monarchs and swallowtails flying around thanks to their gardens.\n\nI was lucky enough to see the entire process! Many times, and it was unbelievably beautiful every time. I planted milkweed in my backyard in FL specifically for the monarchs, but I also had wasps around the area and they would patrol the plants and eat every caterpillar they could find. This made me extremely angry! I would stand out there and wait to try and swat them with a fly swatter. My anger took over my fear lol. Anyway.. I wound up buying potted milkweed, and left the plants out long enough for the butterflies to lay their eggs all over them, and then bought a huge tent and kept them in there until they hatched! It was so cool. I did this for many years. I made plenty of nursery runs to replace plants because the caterpillars would eat them so fast. In that controlled environment, you have to keep a close eye on them to make sure they don't run out of food!\n\nAt one point I had nine monarch caterpillars, but I only ever saw one set up its chrysalis and emerge, and that happened today too! Hope they get to hang out together in Mexico!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xwukpxl6fgqd1.jpeg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0e739474d2d1af0af78088e23eb21c8f232c2e00\n\nNine?!? That’s amazing!\n\nI planted Swamp Milkweed… and most of the plants I planted this year were for pollinators.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4wmqr4xt6jqd1.jpeg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9107014873aa05703fbe5110b25f3b61d7e45fc7\n\nIs swamp milkweed better for your region? I’m in SoCal. I don’t remember seeing swamp milkweed.\n\nI’m in USDA Plant Hardiness Zone 6b. My Swamp Milkweed grew very well with regular-ish watering. It’s supposed to be better behaved than regular Milkweed. \n\nAccording to google:\nSwamp milkweed (Asclepias incarnata) can grow in USDA hardiness zones 3–9, but it’s native to most of the United States and Eastern Canada. It’s often found in wet meadows, river bottoms, and swamps.\n\nWe need way more of this on reddit\n\nHope to make this a yearly tradition in my garden! Adding new plants all the time for our friends.\n\nCongrats on your butterfly 🦋 and if you want to attract more, milkweed is the key for monarchs! They will eat it and breed. My former boss has a huge butterfly garden and he regularly buys milkweed. Just thought I’d share.\n\nI have 6 plants! 2 I bought from a garden store and 4 I planted from seeds. They’ll be even bigger and better next season. Just trying to keep the aphids off of them.\n\nI got hella aphids on mine this year too. Did you do anything in particular that seemed to help? I was worried about spraying neem oil if it would drive away the butterflies\n\nBoth my swamp milkweed and butterfly weed have bad aphids. I've just been letting things play out without doing anything (which pains me), but the ladybugs have recently shown up in force. They seem to be taking care of the issue. And so far, the plant seems fine. It's just kind of ugly.\n\nI'll hope some ladybugs show up! The milkweed plant itself isn't the best looking (to me at least) so I don't mind if they suck the color out\n\nI bought some ladybugs as a first step to combatting the aphids. Some of them snacked on the aphids but the rest disappeared. I even bought one of those ladybug houses Lowe’s sells.\n\nThe only thing that really works in my garden is taking each milkweed stem by hand, gently flip the top of the plant upside down (where the aphids gather), and spray them off with the hose. Use a shower-type setting, nothing too harsh. I might have to go thru a couple of times but they seem to stay away for a while. I rarely ever see ladybugs here and I don't want to use chemicals or oils in case it may harm the caterpillars.\n\nYeah harming the caterpillars is what I'm worried about since theyre the only reason I planted milkweed. \n\nI've manually gone through the plant and tried to brush them off but it's tedious and takes too long. Your water method sounds much better I'll give it a try\n\nHello, beautiful! Welcome to the world!\n\nThat is so cool! I got to watch and photograph a black swallowtail turn from a caterpillar to a butterfly back in May. It was so exciting! Nature can be so amazing sometimes.\n\nHow incredible 😍\n\nYou are so lucky 🤩🤩\n\nStill can't believe it myself!\n\nThis is just amazing!!! Always good to see good being returned back to nature!!\n\nYou are so lucky to have caught that moment! Congratulations!\n\nCongrats! We had a huge milkweed in Florida that was swarming with caterpillars and then lots of chrysalises. Not many plants for these butterflies anymore, thank you for helping them! Plant more milkweed!!\n\nBeautiful! Congratulations!\n\nAmazing, it’s in these moments we realize the beauty of this world 🦋\n\nAgreed! I’m in awe of these beauties.\n\nGood job!!! Save seeds from that narrow leaf aesclepia and sow next spring!\n\nOoh how do I find the seeds? It’s a fairly young plant still.\n\nOh ok maybe next year. Don’t pinch off the flowers and let it form pods. Let the pods ripen, dry and open. The seeds will be flat and once mature they are attached to willowy white fibers that will blow away the wind. Paper bag it before that happens\n\nThanks for the advice! Saving for next year! I bought 2 young plants from a garden store and 4 are sprouting from seeds right now.\n\nOh then maybe there was a mature pod that dropped some seeds nearby. Those are great native monarch host plants\n\nCocoon = moth caterpillar silk casing Chrysalis = butterfly pupa\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7hl6nke3kjqd1.jpeg?width=700&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7c4c3f4b27b1d614121f4797a05ea880efe2f422\n\nThanks! I thought they were interchangeable for some reason. TIL!\n\nI used to as well.  My wife set me straight! 😉\n\nCongratulations!!!!!! This is peak gardening accomplishment!\n\nThanks! This is the first month of my garden. Hoping for more next year once my plants are more mature.\n\nThat’s beautiful!! I’m glad you got to see that!\n\nThis is awesome. Thank you for sharing this!\n\nThis is why some of us garden!❤️\n\nThis was my main motivation when choosing plants. We have many monarchs and swallowtails in our neighborhood thanks to the plants the neighbors have planted. I chose all of the plants in my garden for the butterflies and looked to my neighbors for inspiration. One of my neighbors has the most robust garden for butterflies they even have monarch waystation certification. Their garden is stunning.\n\nThose were such cool shots you got of it in its chrysalis.  Beautiful\n\n\n\n[Here is a tiktok I made as a Timelapse of the whole process](https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTFrYQjgX/)\n\nVery cool! Which kind of milkweed did you plant? The leaves look like maybe tuberosa or incarnata? \n\nOur neighborhood has a lot of common milkweed but it becomes inundated with aphids and I've wondered if a different variety may be less susceptible.\n\nI’m in SoCal. The native milkweed here is narrow milkweed or Asclepias fascicularis. \n\nUnfortunately, my milkweeds did get an aphid infestation. I bought a neem oil spray to combat it.\n\nIs that what’s pictured? The woody stems look like rosemary to me\n\nCorrect it created the chrysalis on my rosemary. It still munched through half of my milkweed before it created its chrysalis.\n\nTy, how surprising!\n\nThe rosemary is more sturdy than the milkweed. The milkweed is still young and a little flimsy. I think that might be why it chose the rosemary over the milkweed for the chrysalis.\n\non the rosemary!!! I like their thinking, awesome pics ❤️\n\nHow wonderful to watch the metamorphosis. Beautiful ❤️\n\nThat’s awesome! Nature rocks!\n\nThis is so so cool!!\n\nWhat a beautiful miracle\n\nAlways so exciting!\n\nThank you for sharing these amazing pics!\n\nHow beautiful!\n\nGood on you! Helping another enter this world ❤️🦋\n\nBeautiful!  I’m so jealous!\n\nWow!! Need to remember to buy some milkweed next year 😍\n\nYes! Hope you get some butterflies to your garden\n\nCongrats, that's winning the butterfly lottery!\n\nI love seeing efforts to help the monarchs and other pollinators. You have done a wonderful thing, OP. Hopefully more gardeners do the same!\n\nSuccess 👏\n\nThis is awesome! I caught a cicada coming out of it’s shell, but it was night time and my photos aren’t great. I enjoyed watching it though! Nature is cool!\n\n😭😍👏🏼🙌🏻🦋\n\nCongratulations!\n\nA great home for a great species.\n\nooh what a gift! thanks for sharing.\n\nIsn’t that just the most amazing miracle of nature!!\n\nOh yeah, Monarch butterfly! I'm looking to plant some milkweed for the butterflies🤎\n\nDo it!!! This was the first month of having my garden. Hope you get a monarch to you!\n\nJust wow 🤩\n\nYay\n\nHow exciting! I'd be so tickled.\n\nNot to be dumb, but why don't y'all kill them as babies if they eat out plants?\n\nDo yall have like a worm section far from your garden beds where you migrate them to?\n\nWhy would you kill an endangered species? The whole purpoase of a milkweed plant is to feed monarch caterpillars.\n\nAre you asking why they ate half the milkweed?"

I didn’t want to investigate too closely, though I’m sure they’re used to it haha.\n\nThey're proud of it. They would be happy with you admiring it closely, but probably not wandering through it.\n\nI will definitely be back to take a closer look (from outside the fence haha)\n\nThese houses are so reminiscent of the neighbourhood I grew up in Toronto. I can almost picture a retired European lady who tends to her garden everyday with an equally spectacular vegetable garden in the back.\n\nThis is Toronto! Near stockyards :)\n\nOk! I was north of that but yep all these houses were built during the same era. The homeowner would totally be proud to show you around their garden 😄\n\nKnew it! One of my favorite things about Toronto is how distinctive the gardens in different neighborhoods are.\n\nI grew up in Swansea! This post feels like home :)\n\nThat's it. I'm moving to Toronto. That is, if they would have me. 🤷\n\nI only *wish* I knew a retired European lady who tended her garden everyday.\n\nThere are entire neighborhoods of them here, multiple, spanning the city. You are most welcome!\n\nIf you have 1.5m for a house like this, *COME*!!\n\nI’m from Toronto too and I was like, is this in Toronto?\n\nMe too! It looks so much like the neighbourhoods I lived in.\n\nI thought the exact same thing. I grew up in this area, and my neighbour was an incredibly sweet elderly Polish woman. She gave me my very first plant that i ever received - a little sprig of bean sprouts.\n\nThis post brought back so many good memories.\n\nI was going to say as soon as I saw the picture, this could only be Toronto. \n\nI think I’ve passed by this house even.\n\nUltimate front yard privacy screen!\n\nGOALS\n\nDefinitely! 💯\n\nI love complimenting people on their gardens. Their effort has brought beauty and joy to an entire community. If the person is outside, please say something. Or even a little note. Spread some kindness.\n\nOh I always show appreciation when the gardener is present :)\n\n🥰🌻 I'd expect nothing less from Dame Judy. &lt;curtsey&gt;\n\nThank you for posting photo of the gorgeous doggo too!\n\nThank you for appreciating him 🥹\n\nWow.  Stunning!\n\nThey have made the most of their space.\n\nThe dog made the pic!  Great backdrop:)\n\nHe’s too handsome not to include :)\n\nWhere is that? Stunning.\n\nToronto :)\n\nThat is gorgeous 😍\n\nAw, your pup has a heart shape in his fur! What a cutie\n\nPollinator paradise!\n\nBonus points for cute doggo.\n\nHe says thank you!\n\nI bet the front porch is shaded and relaxing. They have a nice view out of the windows of all the greenery.\n\nTheir own colorful jungle!\n\nAnd a good boy!\n\nI want to know how they did this cause I’m in love!! I’m sure plenty of hard work cause holy crap that’s a lot and it’s absolutely gorgeous\n\nLots of hard work to maintain and lots of letting them grow and take over I would assume :)\n\nBro has plentiful garden\n\nI love it!!\n\nI like those dr seus lookin flowers\n\nSo wonderful.\n\nThank you for sharing ❤️\n\nOh my God that looks gorgeous. I would love a garden like that.\n\nI wish I can get my garden to look like this, absolutely stunning\n\nOmg i would love this. Its so lush and colorful.\n\n[removed]\n\nI can’t take credit for this one - I saw it walking by! But I assume the secret is lots of time, patience and care :)\n\nSimply beautiful 😍\n\nOmilord that awesome ❤️\n\nThis is off topic but your dog looks similar to my dog in the face\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t9yiaub0uskd1.jpeg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9362a095edec01fa3cfaf76773c5023db5f2cdc7\n\nSo similar!

    "all_comment_text": "Upside down pineapple has been adopted as a symbol of partner swapping culture, so this is actually pretty funny! \n\nWhy is it upside down? I don’t know.  I’ve always assumed that it’s less painful to insert upside down than crown-first. Any swinger historians out there want to educate me?\n\n[Reminds me of this scene](https://makeagif.com/amp/H3Op_h)\n\n\nTruly though I’m pretty sure it has more to do with the fact that pineapples have historically been a sign of royalty or wealth. It’s just been adopted by a lot of different groups\n\nThank you for the sauce. This is exactly the scene I thought of when I learned about the pineapple symbol. You’re the hero Gotham deserves!\n\n🫡\n\nSo, basically, pineapples have been a symbol of hospitality for centuries. Apparently, it originated in Roman times. Basically, it's a sign of welcoming and gratitude for being a part of the space. Eventually during the 60's or 70's, idk when exactly, the pineapple upside was symbolizing turning \"household norms upside down\" by inviting swingers share spouses, or for singles to find married couples to join. I guess it stuck around. \n\nI kinda dig it. I'm open-minded and down, to each their own, but honestly, there's no real answer. I'd fancy it to being an \"urban legend\" type thing, to be honest, a societal symbol more than anything\n\nThe Roman’s didn’t have pineapples.\n\nClearly, I need to put a disclaimer since it wasn't obvious enough that I had no proof for the shit i said. \n\nI'm not an expert on upside-down pineapples, nor right-side up pineapples. Please do not use what my comment stated as a cited credit on your college thesis or for any educational purposes, I'm a pleb. \n\nBut i guess if you disregard all the images and mentioning in ancient Roman Sculptures as pinecone, sure.\n\nBro, we're talking about fucking upside down pineapples as a symbol for swinging. Semantics, my dude. I didn't think I needed to explain this, ffs.\n\nThis dude swings\n\nThere's an area in the Texas hill county where they display blue pottery to show their inclination to swing.\n\nWatch out for the blue pot people.\n\nThese comments are a mess lol. I for one salute you, OP, and I love the idea. I could get behind this trend. Imagine if people spent more time building gardens and posing with crops, and less time on Twitter and Tiktok! The world would be a better place.\n\nWas it though?! Medieval times were damn rough. America before electricity was hardcore. /s mostly\n\nI don’t think they were saying they wanted the world to go back to serfdom 😭\n\nLol, phones are toxic.\n\nAll comments and posts are a mess rn\n\nAhh, upside down pineapple I see. 😉\n\nExactly!\n\nit's funny because only people who grow shit would know how much of a long process it is to get a pineapple like that, would legitimately be a good Tinder photo for that reason\n\nGreat point\n\nTwo long years I have waited for this moment...\n\nhold crops and fish*\n\n* \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ias7m4dl50vd1.jpeg?width=500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c5d7aa72134a44bbf6e0338db4439ab2380b257c\n\nYes, there is the aquaponic dude!\n\nSo many weird comments lol cool pineapple dude!\n\nPor que no los dos?\n\nFishing is murder.\n\nFish in my stomach goes blup blup\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ph70w8n510vd1.jpeg?width=750&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b71ebda38f87011ae96869885371af6bfae303b3\n\nIt's a video screenshot\n\nRIP your DMs.\n\nEat ass not grass\n\nLol wtf is this post.

But then again, I could look like a Pokemon trainer\n\nYour pineapple is saying no to your hand, by the position of the leaves. 😂\n\nStart a revolution on dating apps! Crops are mad sexy! Haha\n\nAbout to download one just for this\n\nI was worried that my algorithm thought I was a swinger. Good jump scare.\n\n❤️ this!\n\nBasically quit fishing and become a swinger. No thanks.\n\nHold whatever the heck you want\n\nI’d swipe right!\n\nThat’s amazing!\n\nPraiseworthy sentiment indeed\n\nOh shit, I love this saying hold crops not fish. \nOh I need to remember this. Congrats on the pineapple also, that’s dedication.\n\nThanks I adjusted from grow food not lawns if you were curious\n\nLove that too. Keep you the good work.\n\nThat’s just ridiculous lol 😆\n\nI always swipe right when folks show me their produce on Tinder. Hot AF.\n\nWhy did I expect the pineapple top to start flipping? 😄 good catch!! 🍍\n\nThat pineapple top is CRAZY\n\nWoah\n\nThat's not how you hold a fish. You gotta stretch your arms and make it look bigger. We can play \"guess the weight\" too! I'm down. I will hold my fish, and my crops! I'm a catch an release fisherman so you'll only see me holding a fish if I'm harvesting the fish. I do not catch and release veggies. Those are all trophy catches!\n\nThank you for your service and making a fun trend!\n\nHahaha omg hot\n\nTOTALLY AGREE!\n\nFinally someone who has seen others hold a fish before.\n\n?Porque' no los dos?\n\nBe careful how you hold that. Its currently armed…\n\nHolding it upside down has a specific meaning\n\nNice record!\n\n[deleted]\n\nIf only you knew how many animals are killed by the mass production of crops\n\n😏\n\nBut my dream is to have water garden\n\nI’ve heard it both ways!\n\nPineapple's have feelings too."

    "all_comment_text": "Slugs ate all my sunflower seedlings this spring😑. Officially declared war on them.\n\nIf you want to win that war and don't want to faff around with home remedies that are mildly effective at best, then get some Sluggo Plus bait pellets.  War over.  It's kind of expensive IMHO but a little goes a long way.  I bought Sluggo Plus instead of Sluggo because I found that it wasn't just slugs decimating my pole bean seedlings, it was also pill bugs.  Pill bugs, despite people saying they do not eat living plants, will eat seedlings.  For beans, once bean plants get their first true leaves the pillbugs leave it alone but it takes a while for the first true leaves to appear and slugs and pillbugs can damage a plant beyond the point of return, overnight.  Sluggo Plus targets slugs,/snails, pillbugs and earwigs (and is OMRI listed if that matters to you).  If you know for a fact your problem is only slugs, then regular Sluggo will do.\n\nBeans transplant pretty easy no? Can you set up like a mini starter greenhouse or something and then put them where you want them once they're passed the vulnerable stage?\n\nYes. they do transplant rather easy.  But when you have 100+ plants that MUST be started inside before they go in ground, you like to direct sow what you can.  Usually I can go without much slug or pillbug damage to bother dealing with, but this year the pressure was over the top and then some.  I had to sow my seeds 3 times before I wised up and got the sluggo.  After that, 4th sow was a charm.\n\nGlad to hear you turned it around!  I just had a learning season with my first ever true slug/pill bug problems.   I wound up with zillions of the dang things\n\nI believe my issue comes from mulch.  Organic mulch has great benefits but also downsides as well.  The pill bugs like it as it is a breeding ground as well as a food source.  Slugs love it because it gives them a a place to shield themselves from the sun if the mulch is thick enough.\n\nGreat info. I have a pillbug infestation in my high tunnel. They help decompose the organic matter-but decimate any seedlings I try to grow-especially spinach. I have started in seed pots-but not all seeds transplant easily. Gonna try this stuff.\n\nThat’s so sad! Squirrels have been my nemesis with these guys. Best of luck with the slugs.\n\nSame, same. Slugs ate all my dahlias too. Fuck sake.\n\nYou need a beer, literally I’ve seen them kill for a drink\n\nWill try the beer method\n\nGet a pie tin, fill it with beer (PBR usually does the trick in my experience), and place it next to or in the garden.\n\nCome back the next day and you’ll have a bunch of drowned slugs.\n\nIf you don't like being a slug serial killer, let me comfort you: they all died very, very happy.\n\nForgot to mention all my calla lilies got absolutely smoke once their tip got out of the ground. Can’t even have 1 single full leaf. I’m already using slug pallet this summer I’ve learned 2 whole bottles but the slugs came in from all directions 🤬🤬🤬\n\nI just replaced my sprinkler with salt instead of water. But the salt destroyed my plants. I officially declare war on them \n\nI did not know that they could even get this tall. Wow!\n\nthey got that tall because they were stretching for some more sun.  You can tell because the stalks are much thinner than they would be if they got enough sun.  With enough sun, these plant would be about half the height, thicker stalks, and a little more tight.\n\nBut there are mammoth varieties that do get that tall, and the actual stalks and flowers are even bigger.\n\nOf course, but clearly these aren't a mammoth variety given what I already stated.  Thus, your comment is neither here nor there.\n\nBless your heart.\n\nDo you have stakes in the back to keep them from falling over?\n\nNope! And surprisingly very few have fallen over. We’ve gotten some bad winds this summer in NW IN where I am.\n\nWow! I was wondering if you were in Alaska - which can get crazy giants!\n\nI want to see someone’s Alaskan sunflowers now!\n\nYou should build a tree House in them !\n\n😂 I did start to question at what point they become trees. Some of the stalks were easily 3-4 inches thick.\n\n😄Did you do something Special or just let them Grow ?\n\nThey were 99 cent seed packs from tractor supply co and I ended up getting some pretty poor quality soil (I’m not kidding there was sooo much debris and plastic in this soil) and that’s what I got. I got really lucky and I saved a ton of seeds in hope I get the same results next year!\n\nHoly shit , what a result ! Maybe one single drop of fertilizer should be enough for your own forest ( and the tree House) 😄\n\nSo Fun fact! The Sunflower is Ukraine's national flower due to its ability to remove radiation from the soil! Along with the sunflower being a symbol of peace\n\nSoon she shall storm the giant's castle and steal his golden goose.\n\nHoly smokes. Nice job!!\n\nThank you!\n\nAmazing!!!\n\nThank you!\n\nUh I’m willing to share seeds.\n\nWhere ya at? I’ve got tons I can share!\n\nI’m in north GA. I have so many seeds I gather (sunflower, zinnia, cosmos, 4 o’clocks) that I’ve been giving them away by the quart and starting to sow the rest along the highway. Those look amazing though. I’m down for seed swapping. Those sunflowers look amazing\n\nHOW?!!! So awesome!\n\nI really did just get lucky with 99 cent seeds and bad soil.\n\nThe less effort I put into planting last year's seeds, or letting fallen ones grow, in a pretty crummy part of my garden, the better results I get!\n\nPlants really are just like people with their own preferences! 😂\n\nI love sunflowers. Do not have the space to plant them. But i will do someday. Yours are truly magnificent !\n\nI planted 6 in containers and they’re not this robust at all but they’re managing. A couple are tipping over though.\n\nThank you! 😊\n\nI did not know that they could even get this tall. Wow!\n\nSo awesome! Mine are almost blooming and also super big, so excited!\n\nWe had a crazy wind storm come through, but luckily I staked those suckers before they could come down haha\n\nWow, this is stunning!!!\n\nRocking!!!\n\nLove the jeans.\n\nAmerican Eagle!\n\nIs it a sunzilla?!\n\ncongrats. only 2 of my sunflower plants even made it this year 😟\n\nBeautiful sunflowers!  I hope to grown mine that big this season!\n\nSun trees!\n\nHow do they stay strong when they get taller? One that I am growing is now falling over and I want to help it.\n\nI have no idea! The stalk on this guy is pretty thick though.\n\nSo envious\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w4gx7vj4exkd1.jpeg?width=1848&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7f9e5a1c80e03f25cfb26c8e0e1a6795f7017522\n\nWe have some that must be 12 feet tall this year!\n\nImpressive!\n\nIt took its name of sunflower literally by trying to reach the sun\n\nSunflowers are such a joy. Thanks for sharing!\n\nBeautiful! Good job 🖤\n\nDang! Nice job!\n\nThank you!\n\nDid you use any fertilizer or just a great spot?\n\nJust a good spot I guess! The ground under the soil I dumped is mainly sand so I’m wondering if that helped at all?\n\nWell they look amazing! I do think sunflowers like well draining soil too so that probably helped\n\nThank you! 😊\n\nImpressive 👍 slugs ate all mine!\n\nThis looks like what happens when you cross a Russian Giant sunflower and the normal native plains sunflowers in the central us.\n\nThat's at least [10.2 feet](https://i.imgur.com/aJ9bor8.jpeg)\n\nThey look amazing 👏\n\nI have never seen any that tall!\n\nThat’s awesome! :-)\n\nThey need a warning light for air-traffic! ;)\n\nI’ve had sunflowers get  12’ tall before but that was years ago.\n\nSunflowers only grow this big with hippie powers😂\n\nOh wow those got so tall !! So pretty!\n\nYes!!\n\nNice!\n\nSunflowers are fun. I accidently grew some this year in a small patch under my bird feeder, along with millet and thistle. It actually all looked kind of cute so I let them live instead of pulling them.\n\nSo Beautiful!!! I'm jealous. Groundhogs destroyed all of my mammoths. Cute little buttholes.\n\nHow far apart did you plant them? I grew ‘giants from seed this year, and they’re barely over 5.5 feet. I blamed them being too close together (6 inches apart).\n\nI did zero planning and just dumped seeds sporadically. 🤷🏼‍♀️\n\nIt seems to have worked out okay! Lol.\n\nAlso, when did you start them? Did you start them indoors?\n\nI started them end of May I want to say? Just plopped the seeds in the soil, no starters. :)\n\nDang! You must have had the best combination of sun and soil! Congrats.\n\nThis is both adorable and impressive\n\nThey look great! I love sunflowers they are so majestic. They follow the sun and are overseers of the garden. I have some not as tall as that yet, got them started a bit late but excited to see how tall they get!\n\nWow\n\nSo awesome!!\n\nLove this!!! I planted sunflowers for the first time this year. They are 6 feet tall.\n\nWoah, sun trees. Cool!\n\nwow thats pretty cool! mine are not half as big and somehow too lazy to move with the sun this year, but yours seem to be quite chaotic also, so maybe it is not just lazyness\n\nMy sunflowers on got to be like 2 feet tall ;-;\nHow do yours get so big?"

They are my favorite *by far*. We tried another variety on the right, but it was a flop. These are just rebar trellises and the beans grow taller than my house. The foliage is dense and a beautiful green. The germination rates are fantastic, we save seeds every year from the rest of the beans that we happily eat as dried beans.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lhnd2d8deo3e1.jpeg?width=3072&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6e0451800be53ce4de6d6ccd809fe7b095fd0c2f\n\nDo you have pictures of what your supports look like when they aren’t covered?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8jbsqptl1q3e1.jpeg?width=3072&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=154248d7b5a24d71d0be590be1fa75254a898486\n\nYep, just rebar shoved a few feet into the ground and gathered at the top with a stainless steel wire. Doubles as a nice holiday \"tree\" to be covered in lights and garland.\n\nYour garden is lovey!\n\nDo they vine up the supports on their own, or do you have to train them up? And if you do train them, what do you use?\n\nNah I just plant 3 beans at the base of each rebar and they figure it out on their own. They twist really tightly around the poles.\n\nThank you!\n\nThat's such a good idea! They look neat as well.\n\nLooks like they’re basically teepees of 3/16” or so rebar, maybe 8-12 per trellis. Tied together several inches from the top.\n\nProbably something [like this](https://tipisupply.com/assets/P2120017_copy.jpg), except smaller in diameter and scale in general.\n\nhow beautiful !!! it took me a while to realize those were beans, not topiaries 😂\n\nWhat a beautiful garden!  I love mixing vegetables with flowers!\n\nWhat a beautiful garden!\n\nLooks like a very orderly/organized  front yard to me 😍\n\nAre those dried opium poppies next to the beans?\n\nBreadseed poppies, but basically yeah lol\n\nNice\n\nIt’s beautiful! 🤩  Planned chaos, maybe. But absolutely beautiful.\n\ncan i just say that your front yard is beautiful, and if i ever walked past it, i would 100% be snapping photos !! &lt;333 “chaotically” gorgeous !! i love the more natural, “messier” look !!\n\nalso, i live in england and have never seen bean plants grow like that, so wide and huge, so i’m pleasantly surprised! all the ones i see are much thinner vines! so gorgeous :)\n\nLiatris, Michigan lily combo 🧡💜\n\nGreat heirloom! I use their story when I teach about seed saving and heirloom varieties.\n\nWhat's the good story behind them? \n\nCultural significance: A memorial to the forced relocation of the Cherokee people and a symbol of resilience and survival\n\nNot a lot of \"good\" in the trail of tears.  More integral American history.\n\nWell, a story can be good without being positive. In this case, it's likely being used to try to portray that the story is worthwhile, not that it's a positive or uplifting one.\n\nIt was the best of multiple bad options. You leave them on their land and the citizens kill them, you relocate them and a few thousand die and they are once again forced to move because of American expansion. There was nothing good about it, but the alternative was far worse.\n\nI mean living peacefully or not colonizing their land was also an option.\n\nSo we are going with fantasy land stuff now. Sure. How about come up with a realistic option for the time and people that were around then. What was a better option realistic to the time and people then? I haven't ever heard one.\n\nWhat a strange and repulsive hill to die on. The Trail of Tears was literally genocide and you don't need to defend it.\n\nGenocide would have been leaving them to be killed instead of them moving. It's possible for something to be the best possible outcome and still not be good. The worst thing about the trail of tears is how the Van Burren administration handled the move. I would love for history and the present to be filled with choices that are clearly good or bad and right or wrong, but it's often picking the best of bad choices.\n\nGenocide also includes taking a group of people's children, deliberately destroying their culture, and relocating them with so little regard for their safety that huge numbers die. It was genocide, it was bigotry, it was greed for those people's land, and it was evil, don't make excuses for it. What, are you living on some of their stolen land or something?\n\nOk let me take the bait. If we're considering what's \"possible\" amongst human choices in history... Do you think it was in any way \"possible\" to have the government try to protect the native Americans? Or maybe try to change the minds of the populace that wanted to kill them for the land? Or maybe, just maybe, that there was some other option for the social change for people to no longer desire death for the native Americans and to see them as savages? This is the perspective of the hundreds of people down voting you. That your imagination is weirdly reflecting your biases, not that you're necessarily wrong. But who you're choosing to see as \"enlightened\" in this scenario was in ZERO way enlightened.\n\n&gt;Do you think it was in any way \"possible\" to have the government try to protect the native Americans? \n\nSo send white male federal troops, some who had fought against Native Americans, to protect Native Americans from white people? No. Not only was it illegal to send federal troops into a sovereign state without their permission, at the time, even if it wasn't the troops would have just helped kill the Native Americans or looked the other way while it happened.\n\n&gt;Or maybe try to change the minds of the populace that wanted to kill them for the land?\n\nSure, get all the people, who had fought against Native Americans for their whole lives, been told the most vile things about them, and had their own family members and friends killed by them, to believe if they just didn't try to take land their state said was filled with gold and claimed was legal for them to take themselves, they could all live in peace. I'm afraid the wheels were set in motion long before that point. \n\n&gt;This is the perspective of the hundreds of people down voting you. That your imagination is weirdly reflecting your biases\n\nYou are the one with the imagination. You are imagining scenarios and possibilities that show you do not understand the people and realities of that time.\n\n&gt;But who you're choosing to see as \"enlightened\" in this scenario was in ZERO way enlightened.\n\nI haven't declared, nor do I see, any party in this as enlightened. I do see both sides as  responsible, although to different degrees, by their own actions, for what ultimately occurred. I think that is what people really resist. They want to see the United States government and the citizens as completely responsible and wrong for what occurred. While I do see those parties as bearing a lot of responsibility for a lot of horrible things, I don't see it as so simple and one sided.\n\nJust a few decades ago the popular view was that the Native Americans were mostly brutal savages that killed and brutalized white people and had to be killed off and pushed west to protect innocent citizens. That was a lie people told to keep from having to admit the truth about systematic strategies to kill off and assimilate a people.\n\nToday the popular view is that Native Americans were all peaceful, spiritual people until the Europeans arrived, forcing them into being a warlike people by necessity, and then abusing, murdering, and marginalizing them. That is a lie people tell to keep from having to admit Native Americans were many groups of different people, some of whom did some awful things to each other and Europeans and not always after being provoked.\n\n Both of those views are wrong. Native Americans were never a monolithic group, and there were multiple governments and peoples who came over from Europe who made deals that were rarely kept, some that were never intended to be honored. Many Native Americans chose sides in the wars between the Europeans and often they chose the side any reasonable person would have chosen, and just as often that side lost. That played out many times. Many tribes were very accustomed to war, and some committed atrocities against the whites that are hard to describe for their violence and brutality and many white people did the same things or similar to them. The cycle of violence spiraled again and again. One side \"won\" and another \"lost.\" It's a very nuanced and complicated history, not a simplistic one side bad the other side good story we like to tell.\n\nIt's possible to take your last section as \"truth\" and still say the trail of tears was \"not necessary.\" On my first Google I found an article describing evidence that some people of the time were opposed. If I was a lawmaker of the time, I would have been opposed. Like you said, neither the whites not NAs of the time were a monolithic group, and to take thousands upon thousands of innocent people who are living more or less peacefully and send them to slaughter, it's pretty obvious that there were political reasons that had more to do than just \"getting the warring tribes away from the whites.\" You clearly have an interest in indigenous studies and you say you're aware of the shadow parts of humanity but you cannot reveal the shadow without compassion, and you can't pretend you have the ultimate truth on history and that you're not viewing through your own biased lens (for everyone to see). Id be curious to know what research philosophy you used on your indigenous studies dissertation or other research your published?\n\nUsername checks out\n\nIt's weird that you don't see not being colonized at all as an alternative.\n\nIt's weird that you would pretend that was a realistic option given the time, the history of those people, and people of that time.\n\n\"Those people.\" Don't talk about my ancestors that way. Don't talk about *me* that way. Colonization never needed to happen. The land could support us all without all the nonsense colonizers inflicted upon us.\n\nSee my comment above and believe in a better future- signed someone with some good friends in Alabama. I believe you can be the change! ✊\n\nThe present is much better than the past and the future definitely seems to be trending better than today. The facts of the past and the realistic options available to those living then were what we were discussing. I have seen and been a part of quite a bit of positive change in my lifetime and I don't expect any different of my future.\n\nLeaving them “to be killed by “ settlers was a much better option of course. Why are you suggesting they were moved out of paternalistic kindness lol. The were not loaded up on wagons and kindly transported. They way they were moved was violent and purposely cruel. They were “herded” by men on horses and forced to walk without stopping, with little supplies or food or water. If one of them collapsed the others were forced to keep walking, leaving the fallen to die- even if were a child. Their feet were bleeding they were starving and white military people on horses had whips and were yelling and beating them like they were a herd of animals. The US wanted as many to die on the “trail” as possible -that was part of the strategy. There are recorded first hand accounts of this. They were not being moved to “protect” them from settlers - they were being moved as part of a larger operation of ethnic cleansing. Herding them onto reservations was just a way to save a few of them- the same way wildlife refuges are done.  But the longterm plan was to force the remaining few to assimilate against their will. Hitler wrote about the US “indian” reservations and praised them. He was inspired by them as a way to separate and store people.\n\nId expect as much from a southern indoctrinated individual. \n\nForcing an entire culture to march across the country with intentional small pocks infected blankets, denying them food while the troops feasted on rations meant to feed them. All after them having been deprived of the right to hunt and prepare for a journey of such magnitude. \n\nSorry bama man,  I don't put much stock in a persons opinion from one of the poorest academically performing schools in our nation.  You weren't taught the fact you were taught opinions.\n\nI'd love to hear your solution that would have been better. Leave them on their land to be slaughtered? I acknowledged the trail of tears as bad, I just understand history enough to know it was the best of the bad options.\n\nThere's nothing \"best\" about forceful relocation under conditions that would violate the Geneva Convention if it were to occur today and be considered genocide. It was abhorrent. That's it. No such thing as a gentle genocide.\n\nSo they downvote you because they disagree with… international law? When are fellow Americans going to understand that there were other options than violence and displacement? To come to these solutions now prevents the same from occurring again. Implying it was necessary or meant to be gives a blank check to the future.\n\n&gt;There's nothing \"best\" about forceful relocation\n\nIt was best, because the other option was leaving then there to be annihilated. \n\n&gt;under conditions that would violate the Geneva Convention if it were to occur today \n\nThe Van Burren administration absolutely mishandled the relocation, even by the standards of the day, however, applying standards and morals of today to history is a fools errand.\n\n&gt;and be considered genocide.\n\nGenocide would have been leaving them where they were.\n\n\n&gt;It was abhorrent.\n\nOverall, back then, when people resisted being assimilated and especially when they fought with others against you, they were killed off or had to run. You didn't get to constantly join others to fight locals then claim sovereignty and neutrality after you lost. I would love for history to be different, but the cultural/societal norms of the day dictated a much worse outcome and we should be thankful it wasn't worse.\n\nIt’s a weird false dichotomy you keep coming back to. You’re saying the government had two choices 1) forceful relocation, 2) allow US citizens to murder native Americans to steal their land. What about outlawing the murder of Native peoples? What about recognizing native sovereignty and ceasing expansion? Obviously there were massive incentives in place that made it unlikely for those in power to make those better choices, but by acting like there wasn’t a moral option available you’re letting the perpetrators of genocide off the hook. It’s ok to say bad people were bad, even if they lived long ago. In fact, it’s important.\n\n&gt;What about outlawing the murder of Native peoples? \n\nThat was illegal. Retaliatory raids in the unending cycle of violence between Indians and US citizens, were not.\n\nHow would you suggest the government keep citizens from killing the Indians back then?\n\n\n&gt;What about recognizing native sovereignty and ceasing expansion?\n\nCeasing expansion? You can't be serious. Now I know you have no regard for the realities of the past, just your modern ideals.\n\n&gt;Obviously there were massive incentives in place that made it unlikely for those in power to make those better choices\n\nBetter for who? A collection of different people who chose to side with their enemies nearly every war fought against them? Native Americans were not a peaceful people before Europeans arrived and didn't become that way afterwards; they were just as flawed as those who displaced them. Given how land changed hands back then there was no reason to stop expansion.\n\n\n&gt;but by acting like there wasn’t a moral option available\n\nA moral option by the standards and rules of today.\n\n\n&gt;you’re letting the perpetrators of genocide off the hook.\n\nWhere and when genocide has happened I absolutely call it out. Characterizing the decline of Native Americans after 1492 as genocide from then to now is not accurate or helpful. I do believe there were periods and instances of genocide, but I am not going to call out every American from 1492 until the 20th century as genocidal.\n\n\n\n&gt;It’s ok to say bad people were bad,\n\nThat's nearly everyone who has ever lived. It's not okay to judge everyone from history based on modern understandings and practices. \n\n&gt;In fact, it’s important.\n\nIt's important to understand overall history and the differences in morals, individually and societal, from then to now. \n\nThe congress of the United States passed the Indian Removal Act and Andrew Jackson enforced it. The Supreme Court declared it illegal and Andrew Jackson made the decision to continue in with it because he was making the best decision that could be made at the time. It was that or leave them there to be slaughtered. If you believe there was any other realistic outcome you are just being willfully ignorant.\n\nGenocide occurred regardless of them being left there versus their forceful relocation. Biological warefare was used against them. I don't care about standards of antiquity vs modernity. A genocide is a genocide is a genocide. There's not levels to genocide, all genocides are abhorrent.\n\nThe smallpox blankets myth is ridiculous at this point. There were plenty of horrible things done where evidence supports it, there's no need to repeat myths long put to bed.\n https://quod.lib.umich.edu/p/plag/5240451.0001.009/--did-the-us-army-distribute-smallpox-blankets-to-indians?rgn=main;view=fulltext#:~:text=There%20is%20no%20evidence%20that,to%20Indians%20with%20genocidal%20intent.\n\n\nLeaving them, instead of relocation, would have seen a near total annihilation of all Indians in the United States. I can hate the trail of tears and how it was handled and still understand it was the best outcome given the situation. The past was messy and brutal. The federal government did not have the broad powers or capabilities it has today. Understanding history is important for many reasons, but we can't fully understand history through a modern lense, we have to do our best to understand the period and the people to fully grasp a particular event in it's historical context.\n\nJfc, Indians? You can call them Cherokee. What an outmoded term to use to describe a population that was subjected to genocide and near complete cultural erasure. Show them some respect.\n\nThis shit is reading the same way that sending Jews to the gulags in Siberia was better than mass murdering them in the their homes.\n\nGenocide is genocide. There isn't a \"kind\" or \"gentle\" genocide.\n\nGuns germs and steel. It's warfare 101 bama boy.  It happened it was intentional and anything that says to the contrary is a lie.\n\nYou don’t understand history though? You just skillfully use carefully chosen random historic facts to support what you were indoctrinated to believe and then rigidly refuse any other  point of view without even considering it. You’re so used to your narrow,rigid beliefs and only reinforcing and reiterating what you already believe to be true that you cant even see your own bias and projection. Its like you are in a tank of blue water so you think everything in the world is blue, but you have no idea you are even in a tank. Please dear god tell me you arent a southern public school history teacher? You sound like a 45-65 aged one and your bias is astoundingly obvious but accurate for an American in the SE\n\nYou are wrong. Of course leaving them was the better option for the native americans. The trail was deliberately chosen as a way to annihilate them faster and to save the civilian settlers that would die trying to annihilate  the Cherokee. Even if the white people were too barbaric to consider any option other than colonize and kill, the trail of tears was the worst of the barbaric options aNd thats why they chose it. They wanted to systematically annihilate them faster and better serve the white settlers. You are right in that the trail was tge best option - the best way to serve the  white settlers and annihilate native people. For the native people at that time they were forced with the trail which was the cruelest and most dehumanizing thing the US could reasonably do- they purposely chose the cruelest option bc they wanted the outcome they got - the outcome we have today is only bc more Natives survived than the US originally hoped would. The trail was absolutely not chosen as the “best” way to help native people, it was chosen as the best way to systematically eradicate them by having them die of exhaustion, starvation, and disease and have the survivors forced into one smaller controllable location.\n\nI never imagined I'd be reading a defense of the Trail of Tears, least of all in a gardening sub, yet here we are.\n\nAlabama Man indeed.\n\nYou act like the citizens killing them or westward expansion were inevitable events.\n\nWestward expansion was inevitable.\n\nSo you’re just going to ignore the other part? And no, it wasn’t inevitable.\n\nCitizens and Native Americans killing each other was inevitable and the citizens winning that back and forth, even if it meant killing off nearly all of them, was also inevitable.\n\nProbably something about the trail of tears and beans \n\nDon't trust the government.\n\nI don’t think I’ll ever know! We’re not sure who left them.\n\nIf I had to guess it would be the story of the bean name. \n\n“This popular, vining, heirloom varietal of pole bean possesses 6″ green and purple bean pods with delicious black beans that can be either dried or eaten as snap beans. As its name would suggest, this bean was sadly brought to other regions of the country by members of the Cherokee nation as they were forced to partake in a 4,000 mile death march out of their homeland to the Western US. Its beauty and flavor make this an excellent bean for your garden, and by growing Cherokee Trail of Tears, you can keep the story alive (the best way to keep history from repeating itself)“\n\nhttp://www.phytotheca.com/phytotheca/bean-pole-cherokee-trail-of-tears/#:~:text=This%20popular%2C%20vining%2C%20heirloom%20varietal,or%20eaten%20as%20snap%20beans. Sorry it won’t let me link it cleaner.\n\nThe Indian Removal Act of 1830 forced tens of thousands of native Americans to leave their lands and move to the west. The Trail of Tears is a name given to describe all the shitty things that happened to them.\n\nToday would be an appropriate day to educate oneself.\n\nReddit is so weird. Why are there so many downvotes when you’re just saying you don’t know who left them? Clearly a misunderstanding but why are people so angry about everything 😂\n\nNo one read the second sentence\n\nRight? But then some did also read my comment and reply without even trying to see what they were misunderstanding 🤦‍♀️\n\nI've been thinking about this since I commented lol. It's a perfect case of the majority being confidently wrong.\n\nBecause they don’t know about the trail of tears which is the “good story behind them” and why they used the person used them in the classroom. Also ignorance to Native genocide deserves downvotes.\n\n&gt; Because they don’t know about the trail of tears \n\nI don't see any evidence of that. Seems as if OP took the question to mean the story behind *who left them*, not the story of the Trail of Tears. They're being downvoted to hell for what appears to be nothing more than a simple misunderstanding re: the intention of the question.\n\nEDIT: OP returned and said, \"I was thinking this person had some nice personal story behind these for some reason that didn’t have to do with the name. Truly didn’t mean to offend.\" This seemed clear to me and is as expected, but once the Reddit pitchforks come out ...\n\nIgnorance of Native genocide should be met with all of the mockery and vitriol it deserves. I mean come the fuck on it's the Trail of Tears, at that point it must be willful ignorance.\n\nLegit\n\nFor real. I appreciate the irony of everyone dog piling on OP instead of thinking critically themselves.\n\nAre you unaware of what the Trail of Tears is as a grown adult? Really?\n\nIf you read the second sentence, I think they are talking about who left the beans in their garden.\n\nI was also wondering how the bean connects to that. Is it an heirloom variety? Was it used in story telling?\n\nIt's the bean they carried along the trail of tears to other regions which I think makes this an heirloom variety, it says in the note, which also says they used it in their classroom for years to teach that\n\nThank you 💜\n\nI believe the Cherokee brought them during the death march and they were one of the few food sources they had\n\nThank you 💜\n\nI’ve got no idea either but then I’m not from the US\n\nYeah that was the other point I almost made but then figured I would get attacked for pointing out… to me as an American of course I know about it. But it wouldn’t be that crazy for someone from another country not to know.\n\nYou have access to the internet, I'm sure you could find a way to fill this knowledge gap with less than three minutes of effort.\n\nAre you truly unaware of the term Trail of Tears?\n\nNo no no - I was thinking this person had some nice personal story behind these for some reason that didn’t have to do with the name. Truly didn’t mean to offend.\n\nNice story and beans. 🫘 \n\nBeans do well and keep producing. You can keep a pod or two and pass the rest on to those interested to keep it going.\n\nI'll plant them from now on\n\nOne of my favorite!\n\nThis is so cool.  Would love to try these beans in my garden!\n\nYou can find them here [rare seeds ](https://www.rareseeds.com/bean-cherokee-trail-of-tears?srsltid=AfmBOooilk-FZom_qLVPDAaPB2wnhZs-3FczpGqV0fyIOlmyAY03XUOQ)\n\nThanks.  Didn't know Baker Creek had them.\n\nMy favorite dry bean to grow as it’s so productive.\n\nI live on the TOT 😭\n\nIf I'm not mistaken, the good story behind these beans is that planting them during their forced march ensured that the Cherokee people would have a path to find their way home again and a food source to sustain them on the way. \n\nI now assume someone has planted an entire bean pod in one hole.  It didn’t occur to me that someone might do that until now.\n\nlol I know!\n\nSounds like they were a school teacher. They've seen it all!\n\nI got trail of tear beans from Finney Farms. It's my little secret, cheap seed source.\n\n[deleted]\n\nIf you care about things like the trail of tears, you may wish to reconsider buying from Baker Creek. \n\nhttp://www.theredneckhippie.com/2019/04/baker-creek-seeds-supports-racism.html?m=1\n\nThey also have a weird history of unethical behavior sourcing varieties developed and preserved by indigenous people, and giving neither credit or sharing of profit to the tribes.\n\nOr St Claire Heirloom Seeds for that matter!  Their Google ad’s header is “pro life, pro god, pro America!”  Eew.\n\nWhat’s wrong with pro life pro god pro America\n\nThanks for the info and link! I had no idea and just ordered seeds from them this week. I think taking responsibility for where we source from is a big issue that many gardeners ignore\n\nThat page says \"UPDATE: They have since uninvited him.\" I don't know the whole backstory, but from this it seems possible that Baker Creek didn't know about this part of the speaker's history until the public outcry, and then did the right thing by uninviting him.   \n  \nI'm curious what else you've heard about their \"weird history of unethical behavior\"? I agree that it might be more ideal if they had some kind of public-facing crediting / reciprocity system for any tribes and indigenous peoples that initially shared seeds with them. Not all of their seeds come from indigenous tribes, though (e.g. German heirloom tomatoes). In their books and on their website they kind of sporadically mention the origin of the seeds and so it's hard to know when they are failing to credit and thus exploiting indigenous peoples. I agree they could do better here. \n\nI like Baker Creek and enjoy their seeds. They sell a biologically diverse variety of high-quality, non-GMO, heirloom seeds from around the world. I don't see that as a bad thing, especially in an age of monoculture in which climate change forces us to experiment with crops that can adapt to harsher weather. And it's kind of hard to survive in a capitalist economy without either running a business or earning an income...  \n  \nOf course, it would be more ideal if they weren't making a profit from this business and were simply sharing the seeds as part of a gift economy, like indigenous peoples used to do before colonialism. This is something that [Fruition Seeds](https://www.fruitionseeds.com/learn/blog/re-imagining-receiving-seeds-from-fruition/) is trying to do, for instance. Maybe we can encourage them to get there one day.\n\nCool!\n\nabsolute sweetheart, hope you have success with some!!\n\nThat's so cool!\n\nCool beans\n\nCan you share a website to order from.????\n\nCan they be used as a privacy fence? All year long?\n\nWould you care to share a pod?\n\nMIgardner has them. :)\n\nThat's a bummer of a name. It's a very cool gesture, though.\n\n[deleted]\n\nReminded every time I see a $20 dollar bill\n\nIt’s so you never forget it\n\nYeah, lots of stuff in the USA has a very upsetting past. It's really good to know about these very upsetting things that the People of the USA have supported and allowed their government to do over the short history of this country. It's a great way at stopping history from repeating itself.\n\n&gt; It's a great way at stopping history from repeating itself.\n\n Apparently not because Trump's mass deportation plans sound suspiciously similar.\n\nThat's my point, actually. It's not that it doesn't work,  it's that people didn't learn.\n\nI guess are an in agreement then, my friend\n\nI'm not sure how, but cool\n\nI agree that it's a great way to stop history from repeating itself. You're right the problem is that people didn't pay attention, not the effort to teach history.\n\nYeah such a bummer. Let's just forget all about the Trail of Tears. Such a drag...\n\nThis is so tone deaf that it's almost impressive\n\nOooooo nobody liked my facetious joke.\n\n[deleted]\n\nThis is likely a bot. They have been posting a small poem like this almost one a minute for a while now.\n\nhmm so the idea that some people planted a slice of tomato and got lots of seedlings, make me curious if we can just plant a bean or pea pod and get lots of seedlings too\n\nIf it's dried all of the beans are likely to sprout, but they may be overcrowded from being planted to closely together. You may need to remove the shell to allow soil/moisture contact. Then at that point you're just planting individual beans 💁‍♀️\n\nIt must be Thanksgiving.\n\nNo Thanksgiving would be complete without false narratives about how peaceful and innocent the \"native americans\" were.\n\nSame goes for whites.\n\nYuck\n\nOK boomer\n\nFound the guy kicked out of every family Thanksgiving since 2020. lol."

Turned out a little different\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0pi3twa1zerd1.jpeg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3804a81945976c3239869557b908ace1359d6b50\n\nYour soil just isn't slack enough. The trick does the previous crop, no need to dig. Vetch is king! Ad some woodash where the vetch was in line, saw early or in August for overwintering. They are pretty winterhardy. Have a fleece at hand for extremly low temperatures. And ad some woodash (-: Did I mention woodash?\n\nSand and perlite to loosen the dirt.\n\nImpressive! U got something! I didn’t get one. Womp\n\nMassive success on your first try! Congrats!\n\nThose actually look good!\n\nYou must have perfect soil!They are perfect.✨✨✨✨✨\n\nImpressive size dang what zone are you in?\n\ni’ve never had luck with carrots - congratulations!\n\nThere’s something so happy about this picture!\n\nI'm impressed! Hoping to get some like that one day. So far I am not doing too good with carrots lol.\n\nPrep your soil first. Double dig - dig down then dig again. Remove rocks, break up lumps and add compost, so the soil is loose all the way down and drains well. If you find clay in the soil, add more compost. \n\nSow carrot seeds directly in the soil, don't transplant. Thin them by snipping off the ones you don't want. Be brutal with weeds. \n\nWater when the top inch of soil is dry. Once each month, you can use a fertiliser with more phosphate and potassium, less nitrogen (0-10-10), but not too much or too often.\n\nShelter them from temperatures over 30C (85F) - they'll be happier in shade than baking under midday sun.\n\nThanks for all the tips, the first time I tried, I didn't take it seriously enough but this time around (I planted recently) I did pretty much everything you mentioned, except I haven't settled on a fertilizer yet. And I need to figure out if to thin, when to thin, how much to thin etc. too I guess...\n\nBut your comment really gives me hope! So thanks again!\n\nNice job! Don't forget you can eat those lovely green tops too!! So yummy, no waste.\n\nWow! my biggest carrot was perhaps 4inches...sigh. Well done!\n\nExcellent work!\n\nBig C energy!\n\nSo beefy!!!!\n\nI'm jealous! Good job\n\nYummy...looks great..what state/zone are you in?\n\nFine looking carrots\n\nWOW! Nice!\n\nFresh carrot feast coming up. They're SO much better than anything in the store.\n\nWhat is the secret?! I’ve only ever seen the teeniest little carrots pulled from people’s garden!\n\nThey are some amazing looking carrots\n\nWow!! Very nice! I have no luck with carrots. They could actually be used as witches fingers for Halloween lol\n\nReally impressive-nice work farmer!\n\nThose are some lovely carrots!\n\nNow thats a Carrot!\n\nThose look great!!\n\nWow! They look great!!!\n\nGreat job!\n\nSo cool!!!!\n\nGreat looking carrots. The trick is to keep the dirt loose. If it is packed the carrots won't grow right, you will get some really funny looking carrots.\n\nOh that's great to know! I definitely got some funny looking ones!\n\nHow is it to have a green thumb?   Congratulations 🥰\n\nNice!\n\nAwesome! I hope they are delicious✨✨\n\nGorgeous \n\nWow, they look so damn good !! How will you cook them ?\n\nLook good.\n\nMy goodness you’re good at this.

    "all_comment_text": "Sigh. I am so envious. Your succulent garden is gorgeous. My garden is currently buried under 3 feet of snow with an ambient temperature of - 1 F. Well, at least I am not having any insect issues for a change.\n\nThin layer of snow and 30F here. I have been needing to get into more house plants because everything outside is dead or dormant and it's kind of depressing.\n\n\nWhat garden plans do you have next season?\n\nHave you heard of aquascaping? It's underwater landscaping in a natural, planted tank. There's a learning curve, but lots of helpful resources on line. Check out r/planted tank for more info!\n\nI think you meant r/plantedtank :)\n\nLol yeah. Looks like autocorrect added a space smh.\n\nOh sue then the next thing you know you got a 20 gallon tank and a 30 foot Pothos taking over your window. Infinite water and fish poop will supercharge growth.\n\nI have! I currently have some saltwater tanks but I'm looking at doing a small planted tank. I have a 20g sitting around that could work.\n\nMy plans so far are Sunflowers and vegetables, but that could change esepcially after a February/March visit to the local greenhouses. I love growing pumpkins. I plan on continuing to experiment with coleuses. There are so many kinds and they look lovely in pots or as accent plants with Dusty Millers in flower beds. Do you have any plans yet?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qovb3irv0g7e1.jpeg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=17b71cad028cfb20469d869d82a526fd1474e252\n\nJust a quick FYI about sunflowers they are allopathic and release a toxin to inhibit growth of other plants, especially things that are self seeding 💚\n\nLooking sharp. Good job OP\n\n&gt;Looking sharp.\n\nWe see what you did there. 😄🌵😉\n\nOn point indeed OP.\n\nBeautiful garden! What is the purpose of having them all individually potted? Does it help keep the soil dry? I would be a little nervous of theft lol\n\neasier to deal with individual plants outgrowing a spot maybe? would imagine with the density of plants, it would be annoying to have to shift these around if they were in the ground\n\nThat's a good point,  although quite a few species, mainly  the cacti, are pretty slow growing\n\nThat was my thought, beautiful but so damn easy to steal\n\nCan tie pots down with wire, but they get stolen from the ground also over there. My idea is to only put out in the front what you already have in your back garden, and can just replace anything.\n\nThat’s such a good idea aweschops.  My first two responses to this photo were :\n   1 : What an amazing arrangement \n   2 : Bet somebody steals some\n\nNot OP, but my parents have most of their plants in pots because they have clay soils that don't drain well, and they live in a sub tropical climate where it rains almost every day during the summer. Having them in pots means that the soil can drain and they can move them under cover if the rain gets too much.\n\nJudging by the vegetation and houses, this looks like it's in the same area of Australia, so maybe OP has similar reasons.\n\nLovely! This photo would make a nice jig saw puzzle.\n\nBeautiful!  Your lucky neighbors!\n\nYour succulents are succulent!\n\nLove it!\n\nImpressive 👍🏻\n\nMy first thought is ..I can have picnic here 🍷 🧺 🍄🍸🥗🥙🫐🍌🍇🥞\n\nI'm shocked! You've managed to gather all my favorite plants in one place!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kzrfu22kxm7e1.jpeg?width=1079&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=47dc11b2bd914c0ff5e775cc1a384e888fa85e68\n\nI was going to joke that you missed a spot but you didn’t, not one. Beautiful!\n\nThose would be gone quick if I did that around her :(\n\nLooks great! Is it a lot of work to maintain? I know succulents are low maintenance but yours looks so well curated.\n\nOnly a little work to maintain.\n\nIts soo beautiful, i have a dream to grow a garden like this someday…..\n\nThis is my dream!!\n\nSTUNNING! 😍\n\nBeautiful collection\n\nat that point, build a rockery and plant them in the ground\n\nThat is beautiful, I could gaze for hours 💚\n\nI’m so jealous!!\n\nThis looks amazing i love it\n\nThat is a lovely garden\n\nYou did a fantastic job selecting your succulents.\n\nThat is beautiful!\n\nGorgeous, excellent work!!\n\nLove it!\n\nWOW!!! 🤩\n\nIthat garden is succulent indeed\n\nOh man! dream garden 🪴 right there 😍😍😍\n\nThanks for posting!\n\nMagnificent\n\nLove it 😍\n\nBeautifully decorated garden!\n\nWow beautiful!\n\nSe ve hermoso\n\nAbsolutely beautiful!

Congratulations\n\nthis would make a great jigsaw\n\nLooks amazing!\n\nSuch a pristine garden. I love it! Absolutely flawless.\n\nGorgeous ideal 😍\n\nI'm a succulent serial killer\n\nJust love this! I couldn’t do that in Chicago weather 🥹\n\nAmazing you have very beautiful pieces love this\n\nGorgeous! Wish I lived somewhere I could have one like that. Too cold in Michigan!\n\nThat looks amazing!\n\nI have the worst luck with succulents indoors 🤣  I am succulent challenged.\n\nLOVE! 🤩\n\nPlanting a garden?\n\nA succulent gorgeous garden?!?\n\nNice! May I ask what the edging is? Looks like some different shaped brick?\n\nThe are edging bricks which are usually stacked. I just put them differently...\n\nThat looks sooo expensive. Cacti are Slow growers and they sell for a lot here for those sizes. Unless ypu grew them for a very long time you must have spent a fortune in these\n\nYes, spent a lot. 🙂\n\nLooks Beautiful\n\nCurious, why all in pots?\n\nEasy to move around, better display, can fit more plants in my small garden.\n\nLove it.

Your little kitty has a heart shape on its belly—it's so cute!\n\nShe’s got a wee upside down heart on her nose, too!\n\nMicro r/dickfacedcats lol\n\nEta apparently ya'll have no sense of humor\n\nSometimes I just want my day to be nice and not include dicks 😂\n\nMore seriously, there’s clearly nothing wrong with the sub you suggested, it’s just that most people on a gardening subreddit are not using Reddit in the way that Reddit can Reddit if you know what I mean\n\nMy neighbor gave me one, how do you process it? Mines been drying on the back porch for a month. It seems dried out\n\nI just start peeling it and then once the outer skin is off I rinse really well under the sink because there’s some organic goo to rinse out and all the seeds. Then just let it dry in the sun for a day or so. I do mine before they are completely brown, though.\n\nMine is brown. We will see how it turns out haha. Thanks\n\nI processed one about a week ago- it was more green than these! I rolled it around hard until the skin cracked, and peeled it. It came off super easy. Rinsed all the goop and seeds out, and I cut so it laid flat, like a sheet. Rinsed and washed it again with a bit of dish soap, and then I let it sit in a full sink of warm water and a tablespoon of bleach for about 30 mins. Then I rinsed it AGAIN- seriously, lots of rinsing lol. Then I dried it in my dehydrator and voila!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qmepsce69bvd1.jpeg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5685cd527036235b2548c45b4adf0937ece558da\n\nThis will be my first processing luffa, and mine are as green as yours!  Would you be able to share why you needed to soak it in warm water and bleach?  I'm not sure I understand that part.\n\nI don’t think that’s a necessary step, more for aesthetics than anything because it makes it a more uniform color? A couple tutorials I watched did it so I figured why not 😅\n\nA day in the sun and the green goes away.  Bleach is unnecessary, imo. Some folks like it, though.\n\nOoh, good tip! I’ll do that for the rest of these guys then 🙌\n\nI ended up having to process 20 of these last year (grew 2 plants, in a 5 gallon bag, each).  I kind of stepped / stomped on them to loosen the rinds and pulp from the fibers ,(be careful it gets slippery).  Then peeled off chunks of the loose flesh, then used the stream setting on my hose to clean more vegetables pulp out, followed by massaging the luggage (against the concrete, you really need to press hard on it.). It took a few cycles of housing and massaging ng to get each luffah clean.  Then i let them dry in the sun.  Once dry I whacked them against steps to knock any remaining seeds out.\n\nA friend also grew luffahs, and she baked hers to make the flesh and skin easy to remove / wash out.\n\nThese are great tips.\n\nThat's so neat!\n\nTry putting them in a dryer bag and throwing them in the dryer for a half an hour (at least that is what I do)\n\nHow long will they last?\n\nI don’t know. A while, though. Much longer than a sponge.\n\nDo you peel it before it’s brown? I had to pick ours too.\n\nYa\n\nIt looks like Talulah is very helpful, using her own wingspan for size reference 😻\n\nWhat about the fluffa in the pic? Does he approve?\n\nAll produce pics are required to have an animal for scale from now on\n\nTalulah understood the assignment.\n\nGood kitty!\n\ntalulah was mesmerized\n\nI need to see the inside of these plants now lol\n\nAsk and ye shall receive\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dwlp94hzmcvd1.jpeg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e50fb43f6af1a5a6872f1231d3277b75caa7ba33\n\nAND you have Talulah in the photo. This made my day ☺️ I can feel how scratchy this is 😅 like a big shredded wheat\n\nI have been trying to grow luffa for years. This year i finally kept a plant alive long enough to grow a single good size fruit. As I'm waiting for it to fully mature on the vine, my 50 foot willow tree falls down and crushes the luffa.\n\n😲 I've had terrible luck too bc of our short growing season, but my friend, it sounds like someone *really* doesn't want you to exfoliate!\n\nr/catsstandingup\n\nCat.\n\nI propose that we use talulah for scale in everything! Your cat is so adorable!\n\nI think your cat is really amazed!\n\nomg, your cat! 🥰🥰🥰\n\nOMG, your cat is amazing 😍\n\nShe's the cutest cat ever 😍😻!\n\nOmg cutest cat evaaaaa\n\nTalulah doing her best to help!\n\nI love Talulah 😭\n\n“It was this big!” 🥰\n\nthe second photo i cannot🤣🤣 i love cats\n\nGoing to need a banana for scaling Talulah.\n\nTalulah is the best scale ever!!  Am in love with cat! 🥰🥰🥰\n\nHi, Talulah!\n\nI’m at the same stage with my harvest.  First year tho.  Do i just put them in a dry spot to cure for 4 months?\n\nVery nice 👍 what exactly is it tho?\n\nCat was impressed\n\nWhat zone are you in?\n\n8a! I started from seed mid April, but didn’t have successful female flowers until August. These pictured, plus one I already processed, are all that grew.\n\nThey are awesome. I guess I'd have to start Ina greenhouse. Our growing season isn't that long where I am\n\nI thought this was /r/cucumbersscaringcats for a second.\n\nThat’s the cutest kitty ever!! 🥰\n\nYour cat is such a cutie!\n\nI love Talulah standing up to give a great “for reference”\n\nHahhhhhhhh!!! 😂\n\nNice! Your cat certainly looks impressed!\n\nCat.\n\nAll I see is a super cute kitty!\n\nThe little white at the tip of your cats toes 😍\n\nI've left mine on the vine to turn brown since we don't expect frost, and a couple of the sites I looked at said to let them dry on the vine. I've never grown them before, so is it better to pick them while they're green and peel them, or do you leave them to turn brown so the goop inside dries out?\n\nI’ve always heard to leave them on the vine to dry.\n\nThank you. That's what I'm going to try (provided the neighborhood critters don't sample it like they did the cantaloupes).\n\nKittttyy🥹😍\n\nOk… love the cat, but ca I buy a luffa?!?\n\nI have loofah envy! Kitty is gorgeous!\n\nyou assistant looks very excited about the harvest.\n\nSmart cat! She instinctively knows this is not a cucumber so no need to get freaked!\n\nTahluffah you mean!\n\nThose are some nice luffas.  However, NGL.  I came for Talulah\n\nNot to be dramatic but I’d die for Talulah\n\nHow long since you adopted him?\n\nWe’ve had her for a little over two months! She’s about seven months old and she gets along insanely well with our grumpy orange boy 🤗\n\nI thought you were supposed to wait until post frost?\n\nImpressive! What do you do with them?  I've never tried growing them (actually, I only just recently learned where luffa sponges came from)..  are these too old to be edible?\n\nI have never tried but from what I've read, they have to be very small to be edible.\n\nAlways wanted to grow these, but I'm in zone 5 (way northern NY) and the growing season isn't long enough. ☹️\n\nWhat growing zone are you in?  I tried growing luffas here in NE Ohio, zone 5b, and had no luck getting them large enough before first frost.  I may have not had them in rich enough soil.\n\nBill O'Reilly would be proud!\n\nIs that horse?\n\nKitty poses with all produce from this day forward or don't post anything at all.\n\nSeriously, Talulah is all I see.\n\nthe car 😭\n\nwould anyone be willing to mail me some luffa seeds? 🥺\n\nTalulah ready to fight\n\nThe cat 🥰🥰🥰🥰\n\nLOL HER ARMS!!!!"

What are those?\n\nRaccoons you name and feed!\n\nJust name them all 'Kitty',  so the neighbors don't realize you have a trash panda army that you summon at will.\n\nAlso, regarding trying to make the patio level with the door: that may be a very bad idea depending on how much rain you get and how good the drainage in the backyard is. Generally doors to outside are a step up from the ground outdoors to prevent water from puddling up immediately outside your door and seeping through.\n\nThis. People I bought my house from built a deck that was level with the back door. The entire area around the back door inside was rotted, and the flooring and subflooring had to be replaced.\n\nPlus power washing is fun!! Very cathartic. In my experience, renting one for the day isn’t that expensive.\n\nI too a stranger agree with this stranger.\n\nStrangers unite.\n\nDefinitely just power wash the stone.\n\nAnd then re-seal the gaps with polymeric sand\n\nTagging on top comment to say don't put rocks around the tree.\n\nIt's not good for the roots.\n\nThere's a ton of posts about it on r/Marijuanaenthusiasts \n\n\nYes. That's the tree subreddit.\n\nyep this should be higher up! planting that close to the trunk/root flare of the tree and placing  stones on top could result in the tree dying!\n\n&gt;It's not flammable so safer to grill over\n\nHow bad do you have to fuck up while grilling to light your deck on fire?\n\nNever underestimate the power of human stupidity\n\nJust think- deep fried turkey. And all the stories.\n\nFirst thought was that when wooden patio mentioned\n\nDepends what you're grilling. Iglf you do a lot of basting and aren't fastidious about cleaning your grill..it's definitely possible to turn one into a fireball.\n\nWith the high walls I’d keep the stone and see if you can grow moss between them.\n\nGoing off of this, and sorry if it’s been mentioned already I’ve literally only read this one comment. But it could look really pretty to like cover the weird solid concrete with some wood decking or whatever and then do another step down to the stones with the same wood. So like similar to the drawing but only extending maybe a few feet from the doors? That way it isn’t such a big step down and it could be done in a size that still allows for a chair or two to be up there.\n\nLet the stone be there have wooden bench on it.\n\nThis is the way OP.\n\n2 Natural textures is better than one, and those stones would be a HUGE pain in the ass to remove, and a huge waste to hide under a deck, like the people who carpet or tile over hardwood floors.\n\nPower wash the stone and if you want a cleaner, more modern look still, get a couple bags of paver sand for like $5 and sweep it into all the cracks.\n\nThose two comparatively cheap things will clean it and brighten it up more than the hassle and cost of building a whole new deck will.\n\nTiny pea gravel in between would up the Mediterranean vibe. Get a couple potted dwarf citrus and olives and bring them inside during the winter.\n\nYou know, I thought about pea gravel too, and I absolutely LOVE the idea of the look AND how manageable it would be re: cleaning compared to sand, but the one drawback that is omnipresent in my mind, as a dad of a kid with lego and a house with tile floors, is stepping on a single stone, barefoot, on that slate. \n\nOr slipping on a couple of them like marbles when an oafish party guest kicks a handfull out of the crevice.\n\nIt would have to be smaller and flatter than fishtank gravel and soft enough to not scratch the stone below, which could absolutely be done, but a special order like that might get up there in price comparatively.\n\n\nTLDR: I do think it would look better than any color paver sand, I just worry about the practicality.\n\nAs someone who grew up barefoot with lots of gravel and stone in the yard, your feet train themselves to not stomp when on these surfaces. My brother and I could sprint across our mixed gravel driveway and any friends with us were like keystone cops hitting tacks on the road when they hit the gravel lol\n\noh love the idea about the stones, or sand, i'm picturing like one of those little japanese zen garden look and feel\n\n+1\nIf you use the bench often - no matter how cool the grass there is, it will be bald soon. Keep slabs in place. Maybe as a narrow path, or keep the slabs as a pocket on the left under the bench.\n\nWhat is the creature of darkness in the corner of the second pic and where do I get one? Lol\n\nIf it's on the left side of the wood patio then it was supposed to be a grill haha.  \n  \nI didn't get the highest grade in art class haha.\n\nMy first thought was gorilla, which doesn’t _sound_ that different to griller, so I guess you did a pretty good job?\n\nG'riller is how I'd expect some country bumpkin from the southern states to say gorilla.\n\nYep, sounds right\n\nI love how you executed the twinkles ✨in the lights\n\nI thought you had a big black dog 😂\n\nCame here to ask about the demon on the patio😱\n\nHah! I wondered the same.\n\nI love it. I’d recommend lots of shade tolerant flowers. Between the trees and the walls you won’t get much light. When you’re in at the nurseries, ask them for flowers for shade, or shop in the areas with shade netting.\n\nSeconded, but google what is native in your area! A great way to support native pollinators\n\nBut please avoid vinca (aka periwinkle) 🙃 it’s still sold in nurseries as a go-to shade ground cover but it’s invasive in North America. Ditto for English Ivy — don’t even think about it, you’ll regret it\n\nNo way this backyard is in NA. Just the fact that they didn't call it a yard is clue enough but also that there are few places where you find yards like this in NA is another hint. OP says it's Germany, which I think periwinkle might well be native to\n\nAlso creeping jenny and goutweed\n\nI would definitely power wash the stones and fill in between with small gravel. Plant things that are for the shade and sun you get,coleus, caladium in assorted colors and elephant ears. Impatiens bring beautiful color and grow well in the shade. #2 is perfect but don’t remove the stone. If grass won’t drown in this shady area consider big square stepping stones and fill gaps with small gravel as well\n\nPeriwinkle, my never-ending nightmare from the people who lived in my house before\n\n[Ajuga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajuga) is always a great shade-tolerant groundcover, just make sure you get one that's native.\n\nTbh I quite like the stone patio as is but like the rest of your idea.\n\nKeep the stone. Gras will need cutting, which means you'll need some kind of trimmer. To me that seems like a headache for the desired asthetic. Planters are decorative, easy, and will add more than a lawn. \n\nI love this vision with the twinkle lights and colors. Qhennyou start, give yourself some grace that it takes time (and money!) to get a garden going. Plants will die, some will be flat-out murdered. You will learn as much or more from the dead plant as the ones that stick around. Not being morbid or pessimistic, just sharing how gardens are forever growing and changing.\n\nI can second this. Grass will be more maintenance and may grow poorly under the tree. Consider short, shade tolerant plants, preferably one that is native to the area.\n\nSorry, OP, but Dad’s right. My heart sank when I saw the planks.\n\nSAME. Why oh why would anyone get rid of that stone 😭\n\nBe careful with the decking though, wooden decks are a haven for rodents. I'd stick with stone paving if I were you.\n\nAn old neighbor had the brilliant idea of putting pallets down in his barn. Near  wetlands, swamp and a pond.\n\nIt took less than a week for the rats to move in. Idiot had chickens and killed snakes on sight. We're in new England so very few copperheads around anymore and he didn't raise chicks.\n\nI tried to tell him the rodent control was worth a few eggs.\n\nI agree about keeping the stone, it only needs a good power wash to bring it back to life. Plus you'd save money for everything else, as the wooden planks you have in mind get expensive fast. \n\nI'd also be thinking vertical with trellises, as well as hanging stuff on the wall. You're going to need to post an update once you get it done!\n\nYes to this - go vertical as much as you can - both for more plants and more sun\n\nI'd skip the stone ring and planting around the tree trunk as that could kill your tree. The root flare needs to be exposed.\n\nYes!\n\nCame to say this\n\nYah, keep the stone, its beautiful. selectively prune the tree. This area may get what, like 4 hrs direct sun? Bear that in mind when selecting your wall hanging plants and all other greenery.\nLike the accent lights idea.\n\nCongrats on the new apt. and sweet outdoor area!\n\nThe stone is so luxurious and intentional. The wood deck will look more like modern prefab. Really out of place in this enclosed oasis.\n\nAlso, notice how there's nothing growing under the tree or in the corners right now. It's because there's no light. Plan for those areas to not have any grass. I think nothing much will grow in those corners, so they're good spots for seating/storage rather than plants.\n\nYou have a real low amount of light because of the tree, walls and orientation. At the back nothing grows, closer to the patio is already full of moss. Grass will not do well. Only the part near the house where the current patio is has enough light it seems. Swap sitting and garden area around. Or work with plants that tolerate shade in the back\n\nAgree, i think shrubs  and bark mulch would be easier than trying to maintain grass\n\nAgree, grass is awful anyway. I would try sweet woodruff.\n\nThis is really important. Grass is not the right choice here. You need shade tolerant plantings.\n\nP.S. I like the wood decking. 😉\n\nI would skip the grass. It looks like a lot of shade and it won't grow well at all. It will look patchy and scraggly. Also, grass lawn is ecological barren. \n\nI suggest a variety of low growing shade plants. If you can give your location/zone and tell us whether the area is wet/moist/dry, I can give you some ideas for plants. If you really are sold on one single type of plant, moss would be better than grass. This could play into the Japanese type gardens which have that minimalist aesthetic.\n\nAs others have said, skip the deck, at least for now. It will save money and you can consider if you are ok with rodents living there. \n\nThe ring around the tree is a bad idea. Covering the roots and base of the tree will cause stress and may lead to rot. A nice ground cover that plays well with that tree would be much better. It doesn't look as 'tidy', but that's nature. \n\nI think the concept is good and you can get the vibe you want with a bit of work.\n\nDefinitely go with low growing ground cover that doesn't need mowing instead of grass wherever possible. Regarding the tree, I've seen some really cool patterns for a bench seat that circles a trunk, which might be something to consider.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ymi28mw5rjsd1.jpeg?width=960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e610637e1a39997e0d119cd6f8efb2490a3e3247\n\nWho is this.\n\nAhahhahahahahahahahahahahahaha someone said a gorilla 🤣🤣\n\nThat's my sleep paralysis demon\n\nThose stones are so nice please don't remove them.\n\nIt looks like your design adds a ring and planter around the tree. You should not do this - any kind of dirt or mulch against a trees trunk can cause rot and girdling roots that can weaken or kill the tree. Instead I recommend weeding around the tree’s root zone and adding a couple inches of mulch (making sure it doesn’t touch the trunk) to keep the tree growing strong.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3en0y0t46ksd1.jpeg?width=1536&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b5bf19d0cb6ae6c9ae48339e19d4be3cab244519\n\nGiven the Bougainvillea and cacti, I'm gonna guess that's somewhere hot and dry, so that yard wouldn't have to worry too much about flooding.  OP's yard is way more green so it probably rains a lot more frequently, they'll want greenery and soil to soak up runoff from the rain.\n\nWould also leave the stone and put the bench under the tree, maybe even something you can pull out and lie on during summer\n\nYou could have the kost beautiful little oasis out there......get a fountain ......that bubbling water is just so Zen !!!!\n\nI’d power wash the stone and leave it. Wood only lasts 10-15 years outside.\n\nTwo cents worth:  keep the stone!!! Less grass!! If you like the look of wood, create a meandering wood path. Lean into the shade with a Japanese style garden with Japanese maples, azalea/rhodedenron, a bobble or small water feature. Less maintenance and no mowing.\n\nyeah, doesn't look like there's space for a mower anyway!\n\nIf you’re renting never put in more work than you’re willing to leave behind. If you’re owning do whatever makes you happiest. \n\nCame for the gardening. Stayed for the art\n\nPlease reconsider having outdoor lights. Or at least having them on very, very sparingly. It’s harmful for fireflies, migrating birds, and bats. I understand living in a city you can’t do anything about others’ light pollution, but preserving some spaces as dark as possible is important for these critters.\n\nOur local nature preserve recommends they be turned off by 10\n\nI guess you could turn that planter with the trellis the other way, letting it jut out into the garden. That will divide it into two areas, which will make it feel bigger.\n\nOn the free side of it, you could make a small path into the other corner of the garden, where you could put something, maybe even mirrors in the corner, creating an illusion of a bigger garden? The path could also divide that area into two, one with a lawn and that bench, and the other could have plants and/or maybe a small water feature.\n\nI would keep the stone.\n\nThe stone will not only make it feel more expensive, it is actually expensive, and covering it up with wood planks is a downgrade.\n\nGood on you for renovating the garden, OP. Just that if you really want a stranger's opinion, mine would be to keep the stones and power wash it. Otherwise you'd be making the common mistake of 'modernizing' things and finding out why a certain material is used in certain places.\n\nwow looks awesome but are you renting? its so much work and cost to do up backyard. if you are, lucky landlord. about stones or wood, there are actually these square/rect outdoor stabs that you can \"connect together\" on top of the flooring. this way it's renter friendly, no construction involved and you can have that \"wooden deck\" look. personally i would leave it as the stone, clean it up really well, they will look nice. maybe get an outdoor fire pit.\n\nThis garden would be so perfect for Big Dreams, Small Spaces.\n\nLandlord probably loving this idea, free cleanup lol\n\nYou have such a beautiful space I’m so envious over!  I love how essentially it’s a blank slate just waiting to be filled in!  🪴\n\nFirst off, I always recommend utilizing plants that are already around you and are free.  I would personally sit back and enjoy the space for one year and observe it through all seasons. You may have some really cool plants that do really pretty things at certain times of the year.  Nobody wants to wait a year, so just use google lens to identify the plants, which will help you decide what to rip out (or relocate!).\n\nGrass lawns are super inefficient &amp; pointless.  I’d plant a clover lawn, which you don’t need to mow.  They’re much prettier &amp; smell oh so nice.  \n\nDepending on where you live, you may want to look into xeriscaping… it’s a more environmentally friendly landscape method that utilizes less water.  I also always recommend people try and use as many native plants in landscaping as possible. \n\nDefinitely power wash the stones. Absolutely do not make any structural changes (deck) until you have lived in this space for at least a year.  Regardless if you lay a deck or not, I personally think removing the stones altogether would be an unwise decision.\n\nI love you utilizing the vertical wall to elevate the height in the space. That specific wall is a great choice!\n\nI honestly think everything that you decide to do won’t be wrong, because it’ll be exactly what is right for you.  Good luck!\n\nGreat advice in this comment. \nSeconding the recommendation to power wash the stones and leave them in place! Likely very expensive to put in initially and would be a real downgrade of the space to install a wooden deck, in my opinion, both from both an aesthetic and upkeep POV. Look into Hardscaping and see if there are any flat creepers appropriate for your location that you could plant between the stones if the cracks where you’re getting weeds bothers you. There are many options that don’t mind being trampled underfoot and some are even fragrant. I’ve seen some gorgeous stone areas with creeping thyme, dwarf mondo grass, and baby’s tears - lots of options to consider. Otherwise, a good old seasonal powerwash will do the trick. \nGood luck and enjoy your lovely garden, what a fun project!\n\nPlease ammend your post with some information on what kind of light this location receives and what region/zone/locale you are in for a higher level of discussion about planting.\n\nPlease don’t cover the stone ):\n\nI also like the stone. With a good cleaning they could look really elevated. But your idea of a small raised deck it also nice. And if built as more of a platform on top of the stone, you’d always have the option to go back. The planter boxes on the far end are a really cute touch for herbs or flowers. And the hanging lights would add so much warmth to the space. \n\nWould you paint the walls? If so, make sure you use the right kind, and technique. Don’t skimp on that part; or you’ll have to deal with peeling issues.\n\nOff topic: A) looks lovely! B) your sketches remind me of a Van Gogh - love your talent 💗\n\nI like what you are going for. If I were you I would look into native shade plants to your ecoregion. Not only will they grow heartily and be low maintenance, they will also provide habitat to birds and pollinators which will make your garden efforts feel even more rewarding! There are many beautiful ones to choose from.\n\nSkip the lawn or use a low maintenance altetnative like clovers. You’ll be surprised how much work grass is, even if just a small area.\n\nAlso, from your drawing it looks like you want to build up soil around the tree trunk?  Whatever you do, don’t cover the trunk in any way. The root flair has to be exposed or otherwise the tree will die a slow death\n\nEdit: other than that, love how you’re designing this!\n\nPlease watch the series big dreams small spaces on Amazon or tubi\n\nWork hard to hold on to that tree because I would say it would be difficult to get a new tree to grow there.\n\nIt’s going to be fantastic and I can’t wait for you to share with us your finished result 😁\n\nSomething to consider is the planters and plants you hang on the wall. Depending on the sun you get throughout the day and your climate the planters might dry things out pretty quickly. So I'd keep that in mind when designing them both in structure and deciding what to put in them. \n\nWithout knowing your climate I'd say some sort of stone crop might make a good plant for the walk planters.\n\nHonestly? Everything but the lights in the plants. Unless you want to discourage nature from interacting with your nature.\n\nI would definitely keep the stone. I think if you modernize the rest of the space it won’t stick out as being too rustic or old fashioned. A lot of potential in the space!\n\nWow can you help me with my front yard too\n\nI think wooden planks might look more streamlined, but if that area doesn’t get enough sun and if they get wet, you might have an issue with green moldy stuff growing on them. Also, what app did you use to sketch?\n\nI don't know where you live but there are a few laws you should know about before you begin. The fencing ownership is important because if you start doing things to it and you don't own it the owner (your neighbor) can have issue with you weakening/ damaging his property. Those planters add weight to the fence. Fence laws are a whole legal mess in the states. \n\n2. Grills must be kept 3 feet from all building lines/fences by law. Just keep your grill away from the fence. \n\nOther than that every thing looked great. I do hope you keep the tree.\n\nBest wishes.\n\nI don't really have advice, but it's such a cute garden space !\n\nFill it with fruit trees\n\nLove it!\n\nI like your ideas. But you seem to have a grass area under the tree, and I suspect that there isn't enough sunlight to keep it happy. Perhaps some low-light perennials would work better? Since this is an enclosed space, you could use things that would otherwise be invasive (English ivy, vinca, etc.) without worrying too much. Then you'd keep the effect of green under the tree with much happier plants. I also like the other posters' idea of keeping and washing the stone and putting a bench on it. Maybe get some moss growing between the stones? Anyway, it looks like a great space to work with, and I hope you enjoy gardening there!\n\n😆myself will put a square hanger mesh for some fern, orchid hanging.\n\nYour garden looks lovely\n\ntbh the stone is beautiful. \n\npowerwash, put a bench on it instead.\n\nyoull save money. the rest is top notch.\n\nExciting! Post update pics as you go :)\n\nBuy some metal shepherds hooks that you can stick in the ground. Some come with 2, 3 hooks with different heights. Add some hanging baskets. Then some big pots with \"feet\". I have used hanging baskets to \"fit\" in those pots. \nVoila, instant garden, just water.\n\nI recommend tracking the direct sunlight you get and where so you can put your more light demanding plants in the right spots! Happy growing!\n\nI'm jelly! Have fun!\n\nThis is a lovely private area and your sketches are fun &amp; imaginative. Keep the stone. Power wash it. You can add the wood benches or wood planters on the side with the twinkle lights. Even vertical slatted wood structure leaning or against the wall if you want j hooks with hanging pots or climbing plants. Everything else looks superb. I wish you were my friend. I’d love to come visit it! If you get around to it please post your results. Good luck!\n\n100% with keeping flag stone. It doesn’t look like a place grass will grow well too and looks like that’s been tried and failed before. I’d probably lean into a Japanese/modern garden with shingles or stones and weathering steel boundaries on borders, even maybe a wall of it to bring in color and warmth. I think that’s what you’re looking for with the wood. Perhaps you can introduce dark tones with wood that has been persevered by burning (Japanese method you can google).\n\nA small pond or fountain might be really relaxing\n\nI would add mirrors in the end to give it a little depht.\n\n[like this](https://www.cutplasticsheeting.co.uk/a-guide-to-garden-mirrors/)\n\nHonestly, I like how it looks right now. You could tidy up around the porch a little, power wash the white walls, and scatter some shade-tolerant native wildflower seeds for your area.\n\nLike another commenter suggested, a nice wooden bench would tie it all together.\n\nEdit: I just wanted to add that I feel the space is already full of life. The images you’ve drawn have a more classic, polished appeal, but in reality, that style would make the environment more sterile and less vibrant. I hope this doesn’t come off as a critique of your style—it’s just my perspective. It also might prove difficult to get grass to grow in that area. I think you’ve already got something great going here!\n\nEdit 2: If you’d like some inspiration for what I’m suggesting, google “Native Atrium Garden” your space is already well on its way to a very desirable and calming look!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bgn7yzeugksd1.jpeg?width=2535&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f688fe502c86c5c502b1b794fa9f0ee47caefe75\n\nKeep the stone! Just power wash it and do weed maintenance. It’s more fire-resistant and I think it looks way better than a wood deck\n\nTheres something mysterious about what it currently looks like, that I like.\n\nOh my gosh, there's a bear eating your lemon tree!\n\nThe stones are beautiful I would definitely keep them\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aywgmzgonksd1.jpeg?width=500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d7154adb2b19fc10bca5f534f05ec108fdcb2fbd\n\nI would do this. Go on Pinterest and type: small garden\n\nWhat a cool space. I agree with everyone else, keep the stone floor. Once you've tidied it up a bit it will look great. I would recommend getting a few large mirrors if you can. It will make the space look bigger and will increase the amount of light to help with plant growth.\n\nI love your idea drawing and also agree with dad to keep the stone. If u really want planks u can place them on top\n\nDo not get rid of the stone. It is lovely!\n\nIt’s probably been mentioned, but grass isn’t always easy to grow under a tree\n\nKeep the stone! It's gorgeous and will give the whole space a sense of warmth and class :)\n\nPutting a planter around the tree won't be good for the tree. It would encourage girdling roots\n\nI do like the stone better as a matter of personal taste, but also because wooden planks in that area would be a nightmare to maintain and would look unsightly and make this garden practically unusable in short order without a TON of expense, both to build and to keep up.\n\nIf you remove the stone then the soil will be disturbed and you will need to dig and pour footings for the deck. If you build over the stone, water will pool and won't be able to percolate into the soil or evaporate. This will attract pests. The area looks pretty verdant, so I'm assuming you don't lack for rain, meaning the deck would have to be built in a certain way as to not trap moisture between the frame and the planks and introduce rot. You would also need to apply chemical treatments to protect the wood from damage and decay, and these treatments would need to be reapplied regularly. Ime, unless you make the choice already knowing how it needs to be built, what it takes to maintain, and are willing to spend the time and money to have it done properly, it won't be long before your deck is replaced by a sad pile of regret.\n\nOn the other hand, those stones are already there, well-established and looking nice.\n\nI see the vision OP, very cool. Congrats on the move.\n\nConsider putting in a clover lawn.  Very environmentally friendly, lovely and soft underfoot, and no need to mow.\n\nKeep stone patio and if you really want planters on that back wall you’ll likely need to have that tree trimmed to allow some more light.\n\nkeep the stone. otherwise you’re like every other millennial who takes the character from their property and makes it boring\n\nWhat a lovely little space! Personally, I would buy outdoor furniture first and landscape around it. Instead of investing in a wooden deck, I would keep the stone and focus on providing shade and a canopied area over your doors. Maybe a pagoda or pergola? These are great for hanging or climbing plants. A patch of lawn around the tree is spot on. Good luck! It’ll be a fun project.\n\nI love the stone.\n\nplease keep the stone i beg\n\nLooks really good. The Stone does look good though. I personally would keep that there myself.\n\nYou'd save a lot of money using the stone\n\nNo offense intended - this is your garden, not mine. That being said I think replacing the stones would be a huge mistake, as would \"clean and modern\". What you have is the beginning of a magnificent secret garden, utterly charming and magical. You can easily incorporate a lot of the same ideas from your sketch without losing that. This space has soo much character! Don't throw that away for an aesthetic you can find a stones throw in any direction - what you have is timeless. \n\nKeep the stones.\n\nCongrats to you! Since I don't see where you are located, zone, how much time you plan for maintenance, or even the goals for this yard, I'll keep my comments on the general side.\n\n1. I would keep the stone: natural, easy to maintain. After a power wash, you could fill the cracks with sand to deter weeds, or even plant small flowering cover plants such as baby's tears (Soleirolia soleirolii),  Blue Star Creeper (Isotoma fluviatilis), or Creeping Thyme (Thymus pseudolanuginosus).\n2. Paint the walls; some, all, or a feature wall in semi gloss (easy to clean). Darkish colors are moody and can be expansive, especially if you plan to use this in the evening. Or, one wall can have a pop of color if the rest of the yard has none.\n3. Add some mirrors to expand the space. If there will be lots of rain, ensure the frame is plastic, and you can paint it a different color to look less \"plasticy\".\n4. Add art. I'm thinking a small beautiful bird bath. Or a small fountain. And/or a mandala against the wall, left of the tree. If there was no birdbath or fountain, you could have a small \"statue\" that doubles as a base to a side table. For example, I have a stone gargoyle, that was made to have a glass top over it. That statue can be elaborately painted or kept simple depending on your style. The glass will give it some protection too.\n5. Lighting. I like your lights, esp around the tree. You could also wind lights around the trunk as well. Lights reflected from a mirror work too. I see a plug to the left of your sliding glass door. I might have the lights be on a dusk to dawn timer (usually 4, 6, or 8 hours) so they turn on automatically.\n6. Seating and a small side table. If you plan to spend time outside, you will need a comfortable chair where you can prop up your feet and a place to put a drink/munchies and a book. If you plan on having family/friends over, they will need a place to sit too. The bench doesn't look comfortable.\n7. Where the stones are, I might add a side unit that allows for storage. It could protect additional outdoor pillows for seating, and the top could be where a speaker sits as well as a small BBQ or hibachi.\n8. Along the walls where the grass area is, I might add some large pots for growing herbs. They can smell amazing, be used for cooking or used for your beauty needs. LOL\n\nHope this helps. Let us know. :)\n\nThat's a really nice space!\n\nThat is going to be an amazing space. I hope you share updates!\n\nFun space. The tree is perfect. Choose your flowers based on shade and poor drainage. Clematis on a trellis will grow well. I bought some bright ceramic big flower pots on FB marketplace and put fake flowers in for instant color. Keep the rocks. Add lots of lights.\n\nNo furniture? Also don’t lock yourself in w planter boxes unless that’s really the only place you want to grow things\n\nThe first thing I'd do is find out what kind of tree that is. It's lovely blocking the apartment behind it, but if it grows to be a much larger tree, you'll have problems with shade on your plants and the roots raising the walls around your yard.\n\nI would kill for that magical forest stone in my backyard. I would keep the stone and rather than add a bunch of grass that will die in that spot around the tree from lack of sunlight, I would add shade tolerant plants for groundcover like ajuga and hostas, both have beautiful flowers in the spring.\n\nGood grief, are you in Brussels?\n\nRead a lot of high-end small garden books, and look into garden mirrors.\n\nDefinitely some vertical pottings/structures\n\nMy house had decking like that when we moved in and we had to tear it all out, wood is quite a bit of upkeep especially if drainage isn’t good. If it’s raised off the ground critters will move in (we had a skunk). \n\nWe replaced it with just a cement patio but your stones look so nice, they’d wash up nicely with a pressure washer. Wood planter boxes would be a good way to bring in the warmth and texture of the wood.\n\nA wooden deck will not look nicer. They require a ton of maintenance/upkeep, whereas the stone just need a good power wash now and then. \n\nWhat a beautiful little space! Have fun making it your own.\n\nAll I know is this is going to be such a cool cozy outdoor space and I want updates!\n\nIf you really want the look of wood, or at least want to try it before fully committing to a deck, IKEA has some great (and relatively inexpensive) click-together plank material that you could try on top of the stone! \n\nI would still clean and weed the stone you have… and try this on top to see if you like it before going all the way to a fully-built deck. \n\nhttps://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/runnen-decking-outdoor-acacia-60518486/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=surfaces&amp;utm_campaign=shopping_feed&amp;utm_content=free_google_shopping_clicks_Outdoor&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gbraid=0AAAAAD27g7zcdQqnLVo2RAoqKdCMQ_cJI\n\nDreamin' big there.\n\nMay not be able to have flowers bloom under ?the shade of the tree\n\nWood planks (a deck) will be quite a large chunk of change, and it will require maintenance. You will be shocked how gorgeous that stone will be after a power wash. \n\nI love the esthetic you are going for. You have a really beautiful space that you can truly have fun with. The fun part of an area like this is that you can just add bit by bit.\n\nPlease post a before and after when it’s done!!!\n\n3rd pic ; far left. it looks like you drew a monster for your deck lol I love it\n\nYou could plant creeping thyme or moss around the cleaned up stones and it would look magical.\n\nLeave the stones and please do not put anything around the base of the tree. Post in r/arborists for much more passionate feedback about why you should never put any sort of ring around trees.\n\nDon’t add a stone ring around the base of the tree.  It may take a few years, but it will eventually suffocate and kill the tree. Look how to expose the root flare and give it a proper mulch ring. r/arborists for help.\n\nHi! What an exciting space. I'm sure you'll love it after all of your hard work. So this may not be at all what you're after, but if you want a more modern vibe but something lower maintenance and eco-friendly, maybe consider using ornamental grasses (preferably native to your region) where it's sunny? They can also pair beautifully with some perennials or even annual wildflower seeds for color. Ornamentals can be super modern if done well, they'll help with soil health, provide food for birds and habitat for insects, and they just look so darn pretty when they move in the breeze. You could plant them around a path or seating area. If you wanted to keep a bigger gathering space past the deck, you could still plant them on the perimeter of the yard. Under the tree, think of creating living mulch to protect the soil around the base of the tree. If you look at woodland areas, there's basically always a layer of greenery that looks lovely in the spring before the leaves fill the canopy, but then it stays lush and dormant during the summer and fall. There are lots of native ferns, or things like wild ginger are great, too. If you put your gardening zone (or, if you don't know that, just the city name), I'm sure lots of people here would be willing/excited to suggest specific plants.\n\nI agree with your dad, clean the stone and dig out  in between the stones, add good soil and plant grass,or like I did buy sod and cut and fit in between.     I did this 8 years ago and it is beautiful.\n\nYou have a wonderful space, look forward to seeing what you do.\n\nYour ideas are quite nice. I'd say consider what will age well, also consider how much maintenance you'll have to put into it.\n\nLove your sketch.\n\nKeep the stone. It's less work in the long run. Also, it will save more money for plants!\n\nLooking forward to a follow-up.\n🙂💜💜💜\n\nExtremely shady! You won’t be happy planting flowers that need 8 hours of sun. Lean into it with ferns and annuals that like the shade\n\nA place for a projector so you can have movie nights. I love the lights near the tree!\n\nI like the stone I would clean it and seal it. Decking it could be costly and the stone is in good shape just needs cleaned . This will leave you with more money for plants and furniture.\n\nWhat is the measurement? I try drawing a plan\n\nIt's kind of perfect! Especially the dog :)\n\nWhat website did you use to make the sketch? It looks good!\n\nMake sure your landlord is OK with you doing renovations. He might even pay for supplies for you.\n\nYou should watch some japanese gardening videos and get inspired! This cannel is really incredible and they have garden builds in small courthouses, so you can see whats possible. https://youtu.be/2zzySJqtMVg?si=Z0vJ4so—IYQ0SH1\n\nAlso.. keep those stones, theyre beautiful!!\n\nI’d do fake grass/turf if it was me, less maintenance\n\nLeave the stone, I would put a high raised garden bed in the center of the lawn with bench seating built in around it for entertaining. Sun exposure will be tricky if you keep your plants to the outside walls and limit you for what you can plant.\n\nI really like the stone. And I think some ferns would look lovely near the tree.\n\nNice!\n\nPower wash the rocks clean. For ground cover be sure to use things that can thrive in the shade\n\nWhat are the cardinal directions of the backyard?\n\nYou'll want to keep them in mind - the \"north\" wall and area around it will get the most sunlight and the \"south\" wall are area around it will get the least amount of light. The \"east\" wall and area will get afternoon sunlight which can be very harsh and the \"west\" wall will get morning sunlight. \n\nThe plant trellis on the wall should go on the north wall to get as much sunlight as possible.\n\ni love that stone! and you could always build an intermediate step that is the length of the paved area to split the height, which would be much cheaper than laying planks over the whole area\n\nThought I’d chime in with some ideas for (mostly native) plants. Your space and potential is inspiring!\n\nFor vining up a trellis:\nPassiflora!!\nDutchman’s pipevine,\nCoral honeysuckle,\nButterfly pea,\nAmerican wisteria.\n\nFor ground planting:\nblue lobelia,\nvirginia bluebells,\ncolumbine (red),\nmost any native aster!! \nshooting star,\ncoral bells,\ngeraniums,\ngoldenrod,\nnative ferns,\nlizard’s tail,\nstonecrop,\nwild ginger,\ntrillium,\nblanket flower.\n\nOn prairiemoon.com, you can choose your region and light requirements to see some more good options for planting!! Happy Gardening :)\n\nI’d save an area to grow some herbs!\n\nI love the stone\n\nThrow your pictures in an AI tool and you can really get a good look at what you imagine it to be. God bless you.\n\nThat flagstone is so nice. I'm super jealous. Just do some weeding and power wash them to freshen them up.\n\nSome person before me put wood planks down and they have rotted. I barely step on them because they’re so unstable. Keep the stone, so much less of a headache\n\nThis can be a lovely space. Your plans are nice, but I would keep the original stone.\n\nI would also consider adding trellises along the walls and planting some of your favorite climbing plants. I am partial to maypop.\n\nThe gardens you drew are lovely\n\nI'd recommend looking into easier to maintain alternatives to grass, since there's a lot of shade. Think clover, wildflowers, or other ground cover plants. Definitely check for non-invasive, preferably native plants!"

I‘d love to have so much lush green outside, but it‘d freeze off every year.\n\nWinter is about 18°C, at night it gets some 8-10C at worst. \n\nSummers are 42C\n\nAfter monsoon is heavenly around Pune.\n\nLovely (in winter) not that lovely in summer though lol\n\nYeah the two months are straight up hell. The funny thing is boganvella goes all wild with new leaves and flowers in summer.\n\nbougainvillea is my favorite by far! They thrive in the heat and are drought tolerant. They love to be ignored\n\nThis is original content. (OC) I clicked these pics from my garden.\n\nSince moving into an apartment after many years of my own home(s) and outdoor gardens, I greatly appreciate your endeavors and successes. Unfortunately for me, my apartment management does not allow for outdoor gardens. I am struggling with indoor plants and vegetables but so very different than growing them outside. Your accomplishments are inspiring and wonderful.\n\nActually this corner is the reason I'm not moving around as much as I should. But I've made peace with this :)\n\nOhhhh I just love this 😁 genuinely smiling like a goober scrolling through the pics. I can feel your passion for creating this lovely space! ❤️\n\nThank you :)\n\nWow! I love watching your garden turn into a jungle! How beautiful!\n\nThank you :)\n\nYou’re awesome. \nI absolutely love when people utilize the space they have to bring in nature. \nAgain, you’re awesome.\n\nIt’s beautiful! Can only imagine the shade and birds that must love your garden.\n\nSparrows. They chirp and jump the entire day. :)\n\nLove the most recent night time photos!\n\nThat would be my happy place.\n\nLove it! What is the trellis framework overhead for the climbing plants?\n\nActually the two plants at the bottom are climbing up the wall with their roots. The colour used on the wall has high lime content. The roots are sticking up and just keep climbing. \n\nThe others I'm just trying to route up as possible. But once the leaves start to fall, they leave older small branches that are basically dead. But then the new ones I can route. And it keeps going.\n\nWhat plants you are using to form the privacy screen frm above?\n\nLovely space 👌 magical in city living\n\nYou're like that Amazon commercial.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k73j302dbdxd1.jpeg?width=736&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=417f06c24747215699dac7c6f8d1b22cd68390d6\n\nThis looks great! Would love to hear some tips\n\nNothing specific. It wasn't so big until COVID. Once either started I got a lot more time at home and I could spend more effort. It grew, people started liking it, it motivated me more to improve things. \n\nPlus all the birds singing helps. :)\n\nWhat a gorgeous space!  Amazing job!\n\nThat is really lovely. Nice job!\n\ni aspire to have something like this one day\n\nSo lovely to watch plants grow and hopefully some to share with others or create a smile in a cement jungle.  😍\n\nThank you. A lot of kids in the building come up to take flowers and take snaps when they dress up for functions. \n\nSparrows love it here.\n\nI’d love to sit out there for a cup of tea.\n\nSeeing your wonderful urban garden makes me (ironically) miss living in the city.  You've done a wonderful job, it looks absolutely gorgeous!\n\nThank you :)\n\nWhat a cozy space you’ve made!  I love when people don’t let small spaces stop them from growing the garden of their dreams.  Well done!\n\nThat Amazon advert really made me think this could happen much quicker\n\nCan i move in? I’ll buy a tea set for the outside\n\nCome up :)\n\nWhat a treat for your neighbors!!\n\namazing post\n\nHow did you keep it so clean , usually with that many plants you would have a ton of growth and dirt on the floor\nAnd walls. ?\n\nWe clean up the wall and the floors weekly. I can't cut the plants. So my heartless wife does that part. \n\nThe roots climb up on the wall as it's lime painted. \n\nDirts - it's not as much. The black local soil has been basically replaced with roots in almost all the pots. \n\nThe only difficult thing is to cut the dry branches. Some dry branches have extended and they have well healthy children somewhere next. It's like a maze to cut them. \n\nOnce I cut the wrong branch and it killed almost 50 odd big green leaves  :(\n\nHoly smokes. Slide 11 is absolutely gorgeous.\n\nAmazing ! Not just the plants but that you thought to document your journey .\n\nBeautiful.\n\nThat's an inspirational use of space! Looks inviting 🤙\n\nBeautiful garden 😻 I wish we had this much space\n\nHow it started\nHow it's going\n\nI love thissssssssssss!\n\nYou did an amazing job \nI sure hope you enjoy every beautiful minute that environment\n\nYes I do. It's a favourite photo spot for the building kids too.\n\nAbsolutely gorgeous\n\nGreat!\n\nGorgeous, congratulations!\n\nInspiring!\n\nAwesome💚💗💙\n\nParadise in the city\n\nminimalist\n\nLife goals!! 💗🪴\n\nJealous! Your garden is beautiful! 😍\n\nI love this!!\n\nThis is so beautiful!!\n\nI love this!\n\nI loved that little touch! Turkish evil eye (nazar) remarkable work. Enjoy your garden :)\n\nYeah I got them from bazar at Istanbul. Lost 1 :(\n\nAww 🥲 its fine you can always come and get another one. You can also get turkish lamp 😉\n\nAre you from Turkey?? I went to bodrum on the trip and saw this very good frame with white House blue windows and boganvellas somewhere here:\n\nhttps://maps.app.goo.gl/hCNgpehVpnCijAnBA\n\nMy stupid friends suggested I should buy it from bazar and i missed the most beautiful thing I saw on the trip. \n\nI can't even get a pic of it but it was a frame, not like a picture but like artwork. The house and boganvellas seemed to be coming out (3D) any chance you know whats it called please?\n\nWhite houses with blue framed windows are the symbol here all south west coast in Turkey. Also you can see same in Greece, Italy and Cyprus.\n\nThat artwork you saw probably one hand crafted from some local artist. They have lots of craftsmanship there. I cant find that on internet because its probably not appropriate to share artwork.\n\nYou should come and see it yourself again 😅\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l8ee8hbnngxd1.jpeg?width=1242&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c1185346195bf6931e0b747e3c752a9d495c987a\n\nAh it makes sense that it's local work. I will try to save up and visit your beautiful country again  :)\n\nThis is beautiful\n\nMarvelous!💚\n\nI love this so much. You have to just take a deep breath when you’re out there, don’t you? It’s wondrous!\n\nYes :)\n\nLike that commercial with all the plants of the patio of the apartment lol looks awsome love the wall\n\nLights and plants are heavenly combination\n\n👏🏻🤍\n\nAbsolutely gorgeous ❤️\n\nWow, gorgeous and added green privacy!\n\nThis is absolutely gorgeous, my dream sunroom looks like this\n\nThis is the greatest post I have ever seen. Amazing. 🤩\n\ngreat use of small space\n\nWow this is absolutely beautiful and amazing!! 🙌🏼🙌🏼\n\nI needed to see this &lt;3 wonderful so proud of you ! I know your plants love you back i can just see it . Lovely job truly! &lt;3 &gt;,&lt; 🫰🙇‍♀️\n\nThank you :)\n\nBreathtaking. Kudos\n\nGlorious\n\nIt’s so beautiful!\n\nOMG! I haven't even lived in the same place for seven years, nevertheless sustained such a beautiful garden! Nice oasis!\n\nI can relate. Before this place I shifted from about 13 places. I would always put a couple of pots at those places and leave them as I couldn't take them with me. \n\nI had setback then that once I get a home, I will make a sweet little garden.\n\nYes!!! Couldn't agree more! Same with displaying my yarn stash. 😬\n\nBeautiful!\n\n[removed]\n\nThank you :)\n\nYour own personal jungle. Amazing!\n\nOh my God this is lovely! Love the Bouganvilla ideas, they look so beautiful! Kudos!!\n\nIt looks so cute!!\n\nWow majestic\n\nThat looks like such a wonderful peaceful space.\n\nYou are awesome!\n\nI swooned. Literally weak in the knees. 😅\n\nSuch a pristine garden! What an amazing progression. I love this.\n\nAbhijeet Bro. You have come a long way. Fantastic work. Keep it up.\n\nThank you man :)\n\nOMG HEAVEN🥹🥹\n\nAbsolutely beautiful!\n\nYou’ve created an oasis looks so zen 💕\n\nThat is cute\n\nWoooow 😻\n\nWow, I love that so much. I dream of something similar!\n\nI hope this motivates you :)\n\nIt's really simple once you get the right plants - a few mins a day (I never spent 10+ mins daily in these btw) and a lot of days you are there.\n\nWow what a beautiful journey!\n\nThis is how my kitchen looks thanks to my wife. 6 years. Hated the idea at first but now i absolutely love the space\n\nLooks amazing. I feel like my garden is growing like this in the past few years. You find the right spot and take advantage. I hope to reach your level.\n\n👍🏾beautiful!\n\nLove the progression and the thoughtful beauty.\n\nThe garden of my dreams!😍😍😍\n\nLove!\n\nWOW! That transformation is stunning!\n\nYour little space is so dope!\n\nWell done!  Its beautiful\n\nSame here\n\nI like how i can see your evolution into not just making use of walls and floors for housing plants, but eventually also a system of trellising that makes use of air space above the plants for training the leaves and vines.\n\nI want to cover the top up so others don't get a view :)\n\nOther people have put in a shade for privacy , I'm trying to add it with leaves.\n\nSunbathing in the nude on our jungled patio, are we?  ;)  Actually, I think that sounds like a great idea.  You probably just need more structure.  Think:  pergola.  A grid, type of structure, and then start training vines around them.  Grapes are great for this.  The only problem is the rest of your understory plants will wither because you can make a dark cave out of a pergola with grapes.\n\nWow!  🤯\n\nSo gorgeous\n\nGorgeous!\n\nWhat an absolute joy!\n\nIt’s amazing 😻\n\nSlayyy\n\nHaha, gave up on those chrysanthemums pretty quick, huh? Good call.\n\nThey died in like 2 months. After that my wife never forced me to get pretty ones. She doesn't like when the plants die.\n\nSure…they’re perennial (in my zone8), but the payoff is just so little, for such a lengthy vegetative state, and so short, a flowering state.\n\nWow, looks so nice and relaxing now.\n\nWow!  This is beautiful and impressive!!  Thank you for sharing.\n\nWow 😍\n\nThis is beautiful, I wish the wet cold wouldn't come soon.\n\nThank you. I don't know what a wet cold is - but winter here is like 15-18 C in the day.\n\nYour balcony is lovely, do you grow any vegetables or herbs?\n\nI tried, but didn't have much success. The birds carry pests so all the plants that are there are very pest free.\n\nAmazing! Congratulations on such a beautiful place. \nMay I ask if you bought the support of the plants hanging outside or if you made it?\n\nHi, I got them made from a local metal worker. They have many of these requests so they weld and fit it themselves.\n\nAwesome! Thank you very much\n\nWow 🤯\n\nYou need flowers and plants !!!!\n\nUmm? Did you swipe left?\n\nThat’s incredibly beautiful!! Wow, the effort shows! 😍\n\nWhat is the aqi inside in your home\n\nThere is a brick factory (illegal) nearby, so 80."
